BipolarReddit,femexdh,t1_felo1ac,1579251939.0,"There isn't enough research to draw conclusions; the samples are typically small and they are convenience samples (but that's necessary); they are based on individuals' own reporting,  (meaning the amounts the participants used cannot be controlled); and they may not control the methods of use or other substances (most significantly tobacco).

For example this https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4504917/

concludes that cannabis use was ""significantly associated with"" low remission rates when measured with Young Mania Rating Scale. For some reason, females had lower remission rates from depression and males from mania. Also, olanzapine combined with cannabis use was associated with lower remission rates.

Of course, the number of regular cannabis users was only ~10% of the total study participants (N = 25), and they were self-selected, so it's impossible to say if they were representative of regular cannabis smokers.

Also, nearly all cannabis users used it together with tobacco, so the authors conclude that further research id needed to separate the effects.

Correlation doesn't necessarily mean causality, of course - perhaps people who are more prone to episodes and instability use more cannabis in order to manage their symptoms 🤔? 

Regardless - I'm not sure if reading academic articles is particularly useful. Statistics are not me. It's way more important to focus on oneself and the impact weed May have.

In terms of BP? Not so much. I'm not managing it well, and in the past two years it's been getting worse. I was a success story and now I'm spiraling out of control. My highs have gotten higher and lows lower, and I'm so scared I'll become disabled and lose my job."

I've said here before that I'm positive it has been a factor in both my full-blown manias. Many others say it even calms their mania, so I guess it varies.

I have tried to cut my weed consumption down, and have succeeded to now use every 3rd day. My next goal is once a week. I have weed in the house, but I have it in a time-locked box until next Wednesday (pathetic, I know - if one has to go to these lengths to not use, it clearly is a problem, regardless whether it is a problem in terms of bipolar specifically).

Even the good times I've had (i.e. hypomanias) have actually turned out to be a manifestation of an illness, so I cannot even look forward to them anymore. The price to pay is so high. My latest episode almost cost me my marriage (I wanted to leave my husband, which was totally crazy, and our relationship will likely never be the same), my job (I was very aggressive towards my boss), and finances (I dipped into my savings-account to buy stupid stuff and go to expensive hair salons). 

Now that I'm suicidally, debilitatingly depressed, I'm terrified I won't be able to work anymore (I'm a lecturer in a business school). I'm currently on a 50% medical leave, and cannot really even handle that.

People often cite medical research, which offers some contradictory results - and in fact, there currently isn't that much research into the relationship of cannabis and bipolar symptoms (mania or depression).

But I think it's more useful to examine the kind of role weed may have had in one's own manic/depressive episodes. Even if there's no conclusive statistical evidence that cannabis does induce mania, that doesn't change the fact that at least in *my specific case* it most likely was a contributing factor - both of the full-blown episodes I've ever experienced took place in a fairly short time span (~18 months), after I started using daily. Regardless of what (currently pretty scant) research says, I'd be reckless and foolish to ignore this, no matter how much I like weed (which is a lot).

Or however much there was alcohol available. And I was a mean, aggressive drunk.

I quit 12 years ago, never relapsed. Once I decided I was done, it was not difficult, as alcohol gave me nothing but trouble. My physical hangovers would last for days, and mental hangovers way, way longer. There's no doubt in my mind that I'll never drink again.

But weed.. in comparison to others, my weed-habit is fairly new (18 months of daily vaping), and the amounts are fairly small (I've been telling myself I'm microdosing 🙄), and this is still so, so hard. 

It's harder to quit as it hasn't completely fucked up my life. Yet. But it's just not healthy or normal to have to use cannabis to be able to do anything. I started because I truly believed it helped with my depression, and it did - and now it's taken over my life."

I'm now on meds, but from summer 2018 I've smoked weed almost daily, and the worsening of my episodes coincides with that. While a lot of people disagree with this, I'm pretty certain that weed fueled these manic episodes, as before frequent cannabis use the episodes were much, much milder. So I'm trying to quit, or at least cut it way down to see if that makes a difference. Also, it's difficult to say if the doctor-prescribed meds work or not if cannabis interferes.

Also, psychosis doesn't typically last for more than a month, so even if you were psychotic, it wouldn't be permanent :)

You have been smoking for a long time, since you were a child. I'm 43, and have ""only"" smoked for about 18 months, and even I have a lot of trouble quitting, so no wonder you are having a hard time. 

I have occasional panic attacks which require taking a bentzodiazepin (which Valium is). These medications have their place. Sure, they can be physically addictive, but not everyone develops an dependence on them. Some abuse them, but for me they have no recreational purpose like weed.

Now, I don't know whether these two are linked or not, but I'm trying to find out by taking a long break to see if the cycling slows down and/or become milder. It's hard, as weed helps with depression by numbing the worst moods, but I think it also fuels the upswings.
