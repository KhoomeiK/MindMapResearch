> By all means, something exposed to 30Ghz will heat up something faster than 1 Ghz

That's only because 30GHz is better absorbed, not because it's inherently higher energetic. How fast something heats up is mostly a question of the absorbed power, not the frequency.

If you're only looking at electrostatics, Gauss' law isn't particularly interesting, it's a direct consequence of the inverse square law, which is the only experimental evidence you'd have. You couldn't use it to justify the inverse square law, because at its own Gauss' law wouldn't really mean anything. It only becomes a powerful statement in the full theory, where it holds in general, even for moving charges, induction, radiation etc... But to arrive at that theory you need to be guided by some sort of analogy, in this case partly Faraday's idea of lines of force which can only start or end on charges. Then you can extend that analogy by including loops, which helps you find a mathematical framework for electric fields induced by changing magnetic fields. In the end, you end up with a consistent set of equations, which have complex and interesting consequences, like EM radiation, and can further be derived from deeper theories, in this case the potential formulation of EM, which then leads you to gauge theory etc...

But to me it remains an analogy, because nothing is really flowing and electric field lines aren't real. We call it flux because the mathematical machinery is identical to that of flowing incompressible liquids, but in itself it's just a dry mathematical fact. Neither do I feel like it's a reflection of experimental facts, I'm not sure it's possible to measure the flux out of a surface, we mathematically derived it from the only experimental evidence we had regarding flux, the inverse square law, and assumed it held in general."

I'm kidding, yes of course experimental evidence reigns supreme. But we still have to tie those experiments together in a theoretical framework, and the simpler it is, the better. To expand on the theory, or to understand it better, we can use analogies like flux, which is directly based on Faraday's lines of force, as a guide. This analogy helped Maxwell figure out the concept of an electromagnetic wave, even if they eventually didn't pan out.

The statement I replied to was that it's obvious that gravity follows the inverse square law because of conservation of flux. My point is that it isn't obvious gravity and electromagnetism would follow such laws, and experimentally that's even reversing cause and effect. We know of Gauss' law because we experimentally measured an inverse square force, it's just a theoretically more complete way of expressing that."
Physics,fn3e19x,t1_fn3apyl,1586618806.0,"I'm probably not explaining myself good enough, the point I'm trying to make is that there is no reason to assume the electric field vector is also divergenceless in the absence of matter. It makes sense for flows of incompressible liquids or flows of energy in empty space to have a conserved flux, but nothing is really flowing away from a static charge, no light, no aether, no energy. It's a beautiful result and it gives an intuitive reason for the inverse square law, but a priori I don't see why it has to be true."
Physics,fn39ebr,t1_fn37vct,1586615943.0,"Flux is used because Maxwell exploited a deep analogy with hydrodynamics to develop his theory. He modeled electromagnetism by flow and vortices in a sea of aether. Charges act like sources and sinks for this flow, which we perceive as the electric field, and assuming the liquid is incompressible that implies Gauss's law.

But even before the aether was disproven, Maxwell abandoned this concept for being too far-fetched and complicated, but some of the terminology remained. Possibly because field lines are readily visualized and Gauss's law is still correct. Luckily we don't talk about magnetic flywheels or molecular vortices anymore.

I'm still not sure what you mean by energy. Energy is distinct from force, and electromagnetic energy is not flowing for static charges. Even when it is, Poynting's theorem shows the flux of energy will always be perpendicular to the electric field vector, it has its own distinct conservation law."
Physics,fn374r7,t1_fn349tt,1586614475.0,"Why should there be an associated flux with gravitational or electric field? Flux literally means flow, but if you just have a static charge, there isn't really anything flowing or moving around it, there's only a static electric field, which if interpreted as a flux, is conserved. This hydrodynamic analogy helped Maxwell formulate his theory, but I think it's more of a mathematical parallel than a deep physical truth.

I don't see how that's trivial, or what the connection is with energy. For one, this isn't true for fields with massive force carriers, so it only works because the photon and graviton are massless. If I'm not mistaken, the most accurate measurements of the photon mass come from testing for deviations of Gauss's law."

Similarly [there is little evidence for masks working for healthcare personnel either](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20095070), but we all agree it's critical for them to have them. [There is not even good evidence that surgical masks or gowns reduce the incidence of postoperative infection](https://aornjournal.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1016/S0001-2092%2806%2963946-X), but good luck getting surgeons to stop wearing them.

We're applying a double standard here, where we're being hyperrigorous with respect to masks, yet recommending hand washing with religious fervor.

Of course, it's still a good idea to wash your hands from the precautionary principle, and because it makes sense for it to help even if it hasn't been proven yet.

Non animal proteins do not. Therefore multiple different types foods need to be consumed to achieve adequate protein intake.

That remains a vague statement. Those RDA's aren't based on good evidence, they literally just doubled the largest amount required from a set of test subjects ""just to be safe"". And even by those standards, the [American Heart Association agrees](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.cir.0000018905.97677.1f) plants provide sufficient amounts of all amino acids.

And if you don't believe that, the vegan staples of quinoa and soy are definitely ""complete proteins"". Sure, not all vegans eat very diverse, but neither do all [omnivores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJGIMd3_LfY). Are vegans more likely to not eat diversely? Unless there's serious evidence that vegans are actually prone to lacking amino acids, the science points the other way, or at the very least is undecided.

The article you linked wouldn't be published in a serious journal, apart from the spelling, it's almost entirely unsourced and just list a few disorders. Kwashiorkor and marasmus are unheard of in developed countries, even among vegans.

> But again a clinical standard isn't even necessary. We are just talking about an anecdote that vegans are ugly. It's probably confirmation bias and confounded by other variables such as veganism correlating with a desire to not participate in traditional beauty standards.

That's entirely my point, it's a collection of anecdotes, and I was simply reacting to someone claiming there's a causal relation with pseudo-scientific rantings that have no clinical basis. Your idea about traditional beauty standards makes sense, I'm sure veganism is correlated with armpit hair, but I doubt veganism causes armpit hair to grow."

Personally, especially the concept of incomplete proteins never made sense to me. Even if, say, beans are deficient in a certain amino acid, most vegans don't just eat beans. Not to mention that those RDA's are not based on serious clinical evidence.

If people still feel like it's a good enough reason not to become vegan, that's no skin off my back, I'm not even vegan myself. I just don't like them spouting those ideas like they're gospel when scientifically they haven't got a leg to stand on."
