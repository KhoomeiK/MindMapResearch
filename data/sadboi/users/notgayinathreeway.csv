Book has a lot of conspiracy and paranormal shit in it and was the first place I heard about mandela effects. They talk about having residue from other dimensions, like an issue of TIME magazine about the assassination of Bill Clinton, given to the main character by someone who swears they remember him being assassinated and wake up one day to find out it never happened, but still had the magazine they saved from where it happened.

Note this is all fiction but it talks about a lot of popular conspiracy related paranormal things like this.

I played plenty of MUDS and space battle games like that where the admin would just be playing the game too, the internet was different back then.

JMods absolutely were in the game talking to people, that was basically the only way to get feedback, and it's not so difficult to wrap your head around when you actually realize how small the community was back then.

That being said, if you read my posts, the big realization you think you've made is what I said upfront I thought was the case for almost 20 years until just this week when I saw the screenshots of DeviousMUD and that was exactly what I remembered playing all those years ago in what was a very vivid memory due to having felt bad for mocking the kid trying to learn. Whether it was a temporary private server hosted by Andrew or not, I'll never know unless he does an AMA and I get to ask him, but I would almost bet my main that however it occurred, I played DeviousMUD.

And how do you know what was in it, have you played it?

Like I said, it was like a couple of buildings and one had an NPC in it and there was a dog or something to attack, and it reminded me at the time of west falador. I didn't say it was falador. I was just reminded of the path of trees from the farm north of falador down to the bank and garden area only the garden was very plain and had a dog or something in it to fight.

If I may explain that, the first Ave Ventura had him sliding his car into a spot and comically saying ""like a glove"" while the sequel recreated the scene with him demolishing a vehicle for several minutes to run the joke in the ground as thoroughly as possible.

This game hits that level of reference for me. It's a bad parody of itself that is a little too much in places that make me not enjoy it as much as I would if it were the same thing done better or just more of the thing i liked to begin with instead of trying to top itself and ruining it."

Edit: if not it was certainly completely dead, and this was when he was running the game out of his mom's laundry room so I'm sure he wouldn't have been above dicking around in the game at the time.

2007scape,fq8ovls,t1_fq8jt3o,1589171483.0,"My memories of it were pretty specific and the whole thing stuck out in my mind because of 1. How naive I was to just go to this random website and trust this guy. And 2. I felt bad after because I realized this dude must have cared about it to want to show it off and I've been embarrassed about it for years like one of those memories you think of before you go to bed thinking he just wanted someone to play his game and we made fun of him.

I started in late 2001 so it could have been earlier but I really think it was early 2002 because I didn't play regularly until  spring 2002. I think I was in falador cutting trees by west bank or trying to kill guards to train, was with a friend and this dude just stopped and started chatting and after a while he was like hey let me show you guys this.

Only thing I can think of was he kept it on his computer and hosted it from his personal website just for us to connect to.

But I promise you it did happen, and I am just as confused about it as anyone else reading this. I know back in the day the jmodsc just hungout a lot.

I remember the day I did shield of arrav I was in varrock sq whining about dying and losing my whole bank which was like black or steel armor and a short sword but it was my whole bank and I was literally crying a wizard or something 3hit me and it was just end times for me kind of upset.

All of a sudden I get logged out and when I log back in all of my stuff is back and I was super happy until I saw I hadnt finished shield of arrav yet so I had to do it again.

Then when rs2 came out it let me claim the reward again and then when osrs came out i got to do it again and I turned in that quest reward 4 times :)

Back to the point though, dude was just a guy who liked making games and sharing them. I wouldn't put it past him to be reminiscing about it. The place I saw on whatever game I played looked a lot like falador west bank which is where I was when he talked to us."
2007scape,fq8h2b3,t1_fq8fk6w,1589166027.0,"Shoehorning this in here, but I promise this is accurate to what I remember.

In around 2002 or 2003 I was playing Runescape with a friend, some dude walked up and started talking about a game he made, asked us if we wanted to try it. Said it was like Runescape.

He gave us instructions on how to find a link to his game, and my friend and I both logged out to go try it.

We played it together for a few minutes, walked around in a shitty weird town kind of like Falador. There was like a dog or a bear or something to fight, and a man standing there in the bank or store or something. It was all very generic, it was all very shitty. Controls were clunky. Mostly trees and a couple buildings, absolute shit compared to Runescape.

It was like a bad imitation, or like when grandma gets you that game you wanted but it's like some shitty knockoff and you just feel bad because you know her heart was in the right place but it's literally unplayable.

We left after 5 minutes and laughed at how bad it was, and made fun of the guy and told him it was dumb and why not just play runescape if you're going to make a shitty remake of it that isn't as fun.


Fastforward 18 years, and I'm watching this documentary last week.

\>MFW they get to the DeviousMUD screenshots and it's the game I played  
\>MFW it must have been Andrew Gower showing us the game  
\>MFW I realize we just made fun of him and shit all over it and walked away from him


To be fair, we weren't saying it was bad as much as we were saying runescape was an improvement, but not knowing it was a prototype build it sure just felt like a cheap imitation."

You have to track down an old build to try to get the game working in offline mode but there's no community for it anymore and you have to disconnect your internet so you don't get banned and you can never connect to official servers after you've played it either, which is why the community died out.

2007scape,fpoijt9,t1_fpnzfje,1588785091.0,"Imagine there's a kid on this subreddit right now, and he's had a rough time and is mentally unstable due to depression or any number of things he feels is too much for him. He's young, impressionable, and needs help so he can feel better again.

But instead of help he sees you, he sees your message. Your words of encouragement in his darkest hour.

""It's kind of beautiful that it was his choice""

This kid agrees with you, more than he thought he'd ever agree with anyone in his life. You are the beacon of hope he was looking for, the tipping point of his life's scales.

He finally has the courage, the resolve, to go through with suicide and is fucking dead forever and doesn't even make it into adulthood.

There are almost 500,000 people in this subreddit. If half of them see it, that's 250,000 people who read your words.

If only 1 in 20,000 of the people who read it are suicidal, that's 12 people considering suicide because of your words.

And before you start spewing your bullshit about it not being caused by mental illness...

Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for those between the ages of 10 and 34 in the United States.

Currently, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States.

A person dies by suicide about every 12.8 minutes in the United States.

Every day, approximately 129 Americans take their own life.

**Ninety percent of all people who die by suicide have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder at the time of their death.**

That means for 90 percent of all suicides, their lives were taken from them by an illness, it wasn't their choice. For the other 10 percent, I'll allow it, but I guarantee you aren't speaking to anyone of that 10 percent when you make a public post like that. We're talking right to die kind of physically sick people who have exhausted every other option, not the kids who are reading this dealing with abuse or neglect trying to make sense of the world."
