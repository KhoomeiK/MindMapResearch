LetsTalkMusic,fpavxbo,t1_fpasw3o,1588456822.0,"i agree with most everything you said, though i think where i diverge is when you seem to think that objectively judging art is *so easy.*  its easy to say that mcdonalds is not as good as gordon ramsay because they are the literal extremes of public ideas of food. as soon as you move closer to the center, everything goes to shit in terms of determing what is good or not. 

im curious why it bothers you so much as an artist? im also an artist and couldnt ever imagine being happy if i felt like art was an *objective* act. objectivity is always predicated on power - who has control of the dominant media and thus, deciding what is *true.* e.g. if you read american history books they do a pretty horrifying job of glossing over the genocide of native people, and glorifying the holy missions of the european invasion of this land. art is the same - the rich and powerful control ideas of objectivity most often. we are lucky enough to have the internet ( the great equalizer ? maybe, debatable but better than nothing ) to allow a wider, and more democratic creation of values. 

the critics who become tastemakers and deciders of ""objectively good "" art   
 are like anybody in a capitalist country - their ""objectivity"" is connected to their wellbeing and income. whether they know it or not, they are held accountable by whoever employs them and the people who follow them and decide their income. do you see whats problematic there? 

i dont believe every film critic in earth is snooty and wrong, but i certainly am not going to throw away my own understanding of the world and agency and pretend like critics always know whats right. i can spend hours developing my rationalized general apathy towards critics, but ill just leave it at this : i am a musician, a writer, a visual artist, bla bla bla.  and i consider myself just as educated and informed about what makes art "" good "" historically and now - i dont believe critics are always right cause i am their equal and my opinions are different sometimes. of course i dont think all art critique is 100% subjective, but its CERTAINLY not all objective either."

LetsTalkMusic,fp9r79t,t3_gc6ud1,1588432840.0,"i actually find that critics are more honest and thoughtful when they subjectively like an album than when they dislike it. weve all read a review on pitchfork of an album we loved that they gave a 6 and we fume about for days cause they were so rude and snooty about it haha.

ive sort of come to the conclusion that id rather read reviews that are positive and coming from a genuine place than read some reviewer who hates women review a bjork album lol.  this applies, perhaps moreso, to the popular critics of right now - ill talk about fantano and pitchfork, both of whom i have a mixed feelings for. watching a review when either loves an album is exciting and entertaining and thoughtful. but both of them are equally known for their controversial, hateful reviews of albums they dont like, and im only entertained by those if i agree that the album deserves spiteful scorn haha. 

let take reviews from both for fionas album : its pretty clear that fantano doesnt actually understand the album lol. he gives it a 7 which is...fine but he also actively misinterprets newspaper and doesnt give enough attention to one of, if not THE major theme of the album - which is redefining a new possible relationship between women. its pretty radical to hear a song like ladies, where fiona is explaining how woman who have dated the same man dont need to be competitive, and her own journey towards acceptance. they can friends. it seems so simple, but deconstructing these toxic attitudes woman have learned to have for each other ( often in the shadow of the patriarchy ) is radical. anyway, its pretty clear fantano doesnt really.... get that lol. 

then you read the pitchfork review and it seems to understand the album in more depth, and offer more exciting takes on it. 

( take this with a grain of salt, i think fetch the bolt cutters is brilliant and also, more innovative than some people realize. nobody writes better lyrics than fiona, other than frank ocean and kendrick lamar who are equally transcendent  ) 

let me tie this all back - i think most critical darlings are earned - at least in some capacity- because i find that reviews tend to be more honest when a person raves about an album. i dont usually find nostalgia inspires RAVE reviews. they can inspire *good* reviews. i definitely think pitchfork is prone to giving say a radiohead album a 7 or 8 for the sake of it. but its pretty easy to tell when someone is legitimately stoked about the music, they cant hide the glee."

IWantToLearn,fp8kuhw,t3_gbxdoa,1588394985.0,"i think people often mistake poetic language as an intellectual practice when i see it more as play. if you had a friend who wanted to be funnier in conversation, what should they do? most likely, they should experiment and immerse themselves in humor as much as possible. if youve ever noticed, the funniest people are always mining for a laugh, and they *dont always succeed.* but because they are constantly experimenting and tinkering, they make you laugh wayyy more than others, and thus you remember them making you laugh more.

i find speaking poetically to be the same! the essence of poetry is developing your own voice, articulating something in a way that others havent. just like being funny, to sound eloquent is to think of unique perspectives and angles and turn of phrase. try treating it like improv or riffing - instead of announcing "" im going to sleep"" what else could you call it? instead of saying "" i feel angry "" or "" i am tired"", could you find a new way to say it? part of this is learning to be in touch with your emotions, understanding yourself better. to be eloquent is to understand something in high definition, and be able to translate that image to others.

i highly recommend this lecture by, believe it or not, the comedian john cleese. he talks about creativity as an act of moving from a closed manner of thinking, into an open manner. we operate most of our lives from a closed mode, because we need to put on blinders to focus enough to make a sales pitch at work or get our kids to bed. the open mode is not so ""practical"" because its basically, day dreaming mode. what if a monkey went to college? what if my heart fell out and i could never love again? john cleese does a wonderfullll job of explaining his methods for moving into the open mode.

ArcaMusic,fp6lxs5,t1_fp5qrvw,1588354607.0,"i mean.... you cant single out one line and say all of it is predictable lol. 

tho my opinion of that line is that its boring coming from, say ariana grande, but powerful coming from alejandra, a nonbinary trans woman who has changed the music game. and she goes on to drag the people saying that she got lucky to get here, and brag that she fucking worked for it and earned it. 

im not gonna sit around and pretend like the words are a poetic masterpiece, but also thats not the point of the track. arca's speaking \*to\* and \*at\* someone - not writing into the abyss - thus the lyrics are conversational. 

for me, nonbinary is a diss track, a clapback for anybody who tries to police your identity and your experience as if what \*they\* get to decide what \*you\* are. 

jw, are you nonbinary/trans? cause ive neverrrr heard any song speak into my experience of dignified rage in this way. the amount of time i spend fending off trolls who think they get to force their shallow and borrowed ideas of identity onto me.... wow. 

i want to own up and say that you calling the lyrics \*predictable\* irked me SO much, cause this feels like deep representation to me ( know that i am not holding onto the feelings, and im not blaming you, just my own reaction!). we need songs like this! being nonbinary means haters flock to you, and you gotta KNOW, like KNOWknow that you can swipe their shitty beliefs away, and be proud. speak for your self !

LetsTalkMusic,fn53nnp,t3_fzla8b,1586655154.0,"hmm. im a bit conflicted with this. i feel sometimes analyzing and evaluating music strips the song of its wonder and mystery. while analyzing music can bring you understanding, i also feel that critics like popular pitchfork or anthony fantano talk about music in such a dry and uninspiring way. im thinking about someone like elliot smith, who didnt listen to usual advice and analysis of how music is "" supposed to be "" and relied instead on feeling ( to be clear, im sure pitchfork and fantano love elliot smith, im just talking about more in the context of ""music analysis"" and music theory. ) . would analyzing his music bring nuance and understanding to what he did? for sure! but i also wonder if we can bring a new language and understanding of music/art through speaking about it in emotional terms. 

i definitely think branching out to your own taste is best! i would question yourself furiously - what is it REALLY that appeals to you? what emotions arise? what memories are triggered? do you feel buoyant? bathed in sunlight? carrying an anchor? while knowing the value and function of tonics and dominants and counterpoint adds to the like.... scientific explanation.... there is a lot of magic in music that is better expressed through poetry, emotions, and the body. just my take!"
socialskills,fn52rca,t3_fzkk33,1586654542.0,"oftentimes the things we dislike in others are things we are rejecting within ourselves. say your friend embarasses themselves at a party, and you despise them for it. usually, it triggers the shame of a memory where you did something less than savory, and never forgave yourself for it. 

people aren't perfect! forgiveness is an essential element of healing within and without."
photography,fn2gobq,t3_fydx47,1586588349.0,"Will I break my scanner if I shine a flashlight into it while scanning?

Someone recently gave me a scanner and i got super excited to experiment and make art with it. I studied photography in school and like to make pictures through alternative means. I haven't had any desire to take pictures for a few years now, and this sparked my interest.

im wondering if I shined light directly onto the scanner bed if it would mess anything up? I remember that if you take a picture of the sun, you can screw up your cameras image sensor. also.... if i continually make scans without lowering the top, will i mess it up that way too? I feel like the top is more to prevent light leaks so you get a perfect scan but a messed up scan is what i want :)

bonus points to anyone who has links to cool techniques for using a scanner / artists who use the scanner as a photography medium :)"

ecology,fmxjhp1,t3_fxq6su,1586466149.0,"isn't that the bane of conservation already? that we favor the ""charisma"" of species like big mammals and forget about the ugly things, even when that is most important for biodiversity and ecological health?"

SantaFe,fmtbggn,t3_fxaic1,1586369938.0,im surprised our infection rate seems pretty low at the moment.... only 66? and no deaths? do people think we are flattening the curve or just slow to the party?
