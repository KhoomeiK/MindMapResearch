See how upset you just got to hear that said to you? You know why it's upsetting, because you as a person know what you are going through and suffering with but when someone says it's a lie it hurts. I mean it doesn't matter to me much because you really aren't that good at arguing. Mostly impulsive with irrational thinking. I don't have the energy to carry on with this gratuitous argument. Show yourself out of this post if you would be so kind. And next time you rush in being ""blunt"" understand the full story before attacking people personally. You could have just asked me in dms about my way of things. I would and still would be happy to explain to help you see I'm not lying. Hell I'll tell you my life's story. But like I said.
