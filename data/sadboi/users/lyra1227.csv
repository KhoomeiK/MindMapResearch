Also, I think people forget sometimes that the primary job you're applying for on JET is teaching, meaning you'll have to get up in front of like 20-30 kids 5 days a week and have to be ""on."" If you are really shy/introverted the job itself could be super stressful."

If lululemon is run like any of the companies I've worked for then top mgmt right now is screaming about ecomm revenue and the team is making it happen any way they can. Everybody knows discounting is an easy way to make quick topline revenue. They all turn a blind eye to it so long as you keep it under the radar bc they want their bonus at the end of the year and usually everyone's bonus is tied to company performance. Also the fact that you need to have an account tells me that another justification for this is that they're getting your PII, which they can then use to send you emails and target you with ads."

5. In the new lululemon tab (tab 3) opened by ebates the cart was saved (bc cookies) and the discount still appeared.

bangtan,fqpvotm,t1_fqpkq5w,1589554830.0,"I think as much as everyone wants to believe that the awards are solely on merit there's also a lot of campaigning. Lady Gaga's been around a long time, has a good commercial history and between her, her team and her label good industry connections. Even if the album's not done, there are def people who have heard pieces of it and her team is doing a good job of spreading hype.

Anyway, it's not that it can't be done (see: parasite, although they also pitched a very good oscar campaign) but it'd be an uphill battle. Aside from the fact that we're all stuck inside, I def think one of the reasons that BTS might be broadcasting pieces of the making of their new album is to try to dispel a couple of stereotypes that the west in particular (and hence, grammy voters) have:

1. That kpop is trendy but soulless due to its factory-like system (which is ironic given that kpop just evolved on the motown industry and if you look further back, the old Hollywood studio system).
2. That boy bands are performers but not artists who create their own music

Which is why it blows my mind they're not uploading their meetings with subs, esp the pre-recorded ones."

This is probably going to sound dumb but I wish at some point I was told when growing up like at what point is your weight supposed to level out and stay fairly consistent. When I was a kid I thought I was just supposed to continue to grow until I just...I don't know stopped lol. Truth be told I was never severely overweight but not having any type of feedback has led to bad eating habits that are now back to haunt me as my metabolism has dropped off. So even 5 pounds is super tough.

But I agree my guess is that any cuts we see now are to pay those suppliers and preserve cash flow for later, since they had anticipated incoming revenue from now through the rest of the original tour dates. Somebody posted that really interesting article about Lilitz and tour planning awhile ago. I wonder if all that stuff is still sitting in PA."

In the same way that enlistment has cultural undertones, celebrity culture has different undertones across the world too. I'll be honest, from an American perspective I don't see how it's an invasion and I think it's a big ask to ask all fans to invest in understanding deeper nuances of Korean culture. That's not meant to discourage anyone from learning about it, but I could easily see a casual person learn about BTS, hear about this enlistment thing and then have questions or thoughts about it affects the group.

Also just to be clear: Didn't mean that you specifically thought one of the boys would read your comment; more that that sentiment def abounds in certain parts."
bangtan,fovji0q,t3_g9pmrw,1588102372.0,People have and will continue to wildly speculate. Whether or not the mods allow it to go on here is up to them. But suppressing the issue in certain places isn't going to stop it from happening. I feel like people act like BTS is reading everything they write about them online. Honestly (with the exception of maybe weverse) the odds of a member finding your (general your) specific comment in the literally millions of comments online is slim to none. And the odds of them caring is probably less. I'm sure they and the agency have run all the scenarios anyway because as much as it is a personal decision it's also a business decision for big hit.
