The only thing, which isn't a big deal to me, is that some settings for the server are only available if you login on your computer. For instance, to set up Plex TV and DVR, I had to access the server settings from my PC.

I would really recommend you get the Pro version though regardless of where you keep your Plex server since for you it isn't a matter of needing to save $50 but just a matter of availability. They do come back in stock frequently but just keep selling out quickly. 

You will at some point regret not having a USB port if you get the tube version. The lower RAM can get annoying, the 8 GB storage makes you reliant on an SD card which can fail more easily than other storage, there are games that are not supported (may or may not matter to you), 32-bit only.

ShieldAndroidTV,fqceyzw,t1_fqa5w8n,1589256564.0,"Well, if it was geographically restricted, I think that would be a bug. I know that hands-free ""Ok, Google"" is restricted to the US and I think 2 other countries last time I checked a few months ago; but the regular Google Assistant shouldn't be.  

Now, I am in the USA as you assumed, so that would be one difference between your setup and mine. It is always possible some geo-location bug was inadvertantly injected but I don't know if the other posters with the problem are in the US or elsewhere, so right now it's just a sample size of one. 

Is the language on your Shield set to English or something else? I suppose there may be some language(s) that Google can't search properly and so searchable apps don't show, but I don't know if that applies to your setup or not. If you did have a non-English language on your Shield, you can eliminate that as a possibility by temporarily changing to English and seeing if that fixes the problem. I would restart the Shield after the change to make sure it fully takes effect.

But I can only make guesses. It has worked for me properly with every update since the first fix update after it was broken. If it works for you on the old version and running the old version doesn't break anything else for you, you can stay on that version by turning off auto-updates in the Play Store and just not updating the Google app manually. Not the optimal solution but one that keeps it working for you."

cordcutters,fowtvz6,t3_g9upmq,1588127046.0,"If you are asking for recs on getting an external tuner, I am very happy with my HDHomerun Quatro. 

If you are asking for recs on what to do about your tv's tuner, all tuners are not equal. Even within the same product line, a particular tuner may not perform as well as another. You could try an amplifier (or conversely an attenuator depending on the signal issue), try replacing the cable(s), try a better antenna, repositioning the antenna, or try a separate antenna for that TV. You said you tried everything already, so if you do exhaust all fixes and it's just a crappy tuner, then an external tuner would be the answer. 

I've used both HDHomerun and Hauppauge tuners. Both work well. The HDHomeruns are network tuners so you would need a TV that can connect to your network (router) but then you can use them on any device (TV, streaming device, phone, tablet, etc) that connects to your network. The Hauppauge (at least the one I used) is USB. They may have other options now - I haven't looked recently since I like the HDHomerun series.

Edit: You didn't mention if price was an issue. If you are looking for the cheapest option, you can get something like a Homeworx box for $20-30."

The Kickstarter one is really for people who either like to experiment, like to be the first to try new tech, or just want to support new tech.

There was talk awhile back of the free Live Channels app (this is a Google app) supporting recording in the UK but I can't say for certain if it has been implemented yet. 

With any of those apps, you may not be able to use a tuner built-in to the TV and may have to purchase an external tuner, like an HDHomerun. Most people recommend getting a separate Android TV box instead of a TV with built-in Android TV anyway, but that is a separate issue."

Edit: There are also paid apps (the above is the free way) to record live TV with a tuner on Android TV.

New ones are just about $10 more expensive so for working PVR functionality, it would be worth the extra $10.

I've been on TMO prepaid for 8 years and have never paid any taxes or fees but I don't pay for my plan directly from TMO. I pay with refill cards. If you use a refill card, TMO does not add any taxes or fees.

Memory problems like i have from this can be debilitating and frightening,  apart from the depression and anhedonia. I had ECT treatment in my 20s, am in my 50s now, and when I had it went from having an almost photographic memory to having memory problems typical of alzheimers or senility."
anhedonia,fmmbi7b,t1_fmm9bzc,1586202300.0,"From what I've read,  the only real change is that some places now use an ""ultra- brief"" pulse, which they think may reduce side effects. Some places use it and others don't because it is supposed to be less effective. There are also some places that will try it first and then do standard ECT if it doesn't work.

Edit: what you probably were thinking of is much earlier times than when I had it when they did not use anesthesia and applied it with very cruel practices."
anhedonia,fmm5n7t,t1_fmm4m5p,1586199235.0,"Well,  I'm glad you are doing better. Maybe when this isolation period is over you will get more energy."
anhedonia,fmlz5bl,t1_fmlslby,1586195827.0,"ECT is not something that should ever be done as a first line treatment. It can have serious irreversible negative side effects. It does help some people and I am glad it helped the person who posted this thread.  


Many other people, like me, have permanent memory loss and ongoing deterioration of memory ever since. It also made me more depressed during and after (and I was already suicidal)  and physically ill during the treatments. 


ECT is not something to take lightly or to try as anything but a last resort. I'm not saying it should never be tried.  Some people say it is the only thing that helped them. But you don't know until it's too late if it's going to help or hurt and negative outcomes can be permanent (had my treatments 3 decades ago)."
cordcutters,fmjba5q,t3_fvikxa,1586126802.0,"It's on CBS so you need an east coast CBS feed. 

Like the other poster said,  this is not really a live event.  They recorded all the performances individually over the last week and they are using clips from old shows. I don't know if there will be live hosting or any type of live interaction but the majority of everything is taped and edited together."
AndroidTV,fmhatln,t1_fmhaosr,1586072735.0,You're wrong about the news. There are live news channels. Of course there are also recorded news shows but there are live new channels on Pluto and XUMO.
AndroidTV,fmhako0,t1_fmh9w03,1586072477.0,"Well, I know there are at least some live news channels on both XUMO and Pluto. And I use it for OTA TV. Maybe you weren't counting that as a stock source, but it is the original primary source for the app."
AndroidTV,fmgfyxz,t3_fv4bcj,1586048172.0,"If you go under Google Assistant settings, it lets you see searchable apps. Some of them that were not turned on by default I've turned on, and then after I searched, it got turned off for an app or two. So if an app doesn't work with it, it will probably get turned off after you try a search.  I don't use those Indian apps you asked about so can't answer that."

1. On an Android phone or tablet runing 8.0, that setting is under Language and Keyboards. So see if you have any settings like that. I don't see it on my Shield TV but a Nexus player may have different settings.

2. Look under Accessibility settings. That is where options for people with various disabilities are."

ShieldAndroidTV,fman55p,t3_ftclh1,1585900070.0,"This has been fixed for me now on all my devices. I assume they are rolling out a Google Play Services update or something similar to everyone.  If your device has been off, you may have to give it a little time to update but at least you can expect a fix soon."
AndroidTV,fmajfhy,t3_fu2540,1585896195.0,"There is a send feedback link in the settings. 

I personally can understand why they would put Play first for two reasons. The first is for people who mean to press the button to play the video but accidentally hold it slightly too long and bring up the menu. Since this is a new feature, I expect this to be happening a lot. The second is for people who long press looking for a detailed video info option or just to see what options are available and then find out what is and isn't there just want to play the video.

Anyway, you can go to the feedback link and give them your opinion. I personally don't think it's something to complain about as you said you want to do. They gave you a feature you wanted and it's just not listed in your prefered order. Complaining seems harsh and counterproductive to me. I would think a simple suggestion about your preferred order would suffice. But that's up to you."
ShieldAndroidTV,fma3dxl,t3_ftuy4y,1585882823.0,They can't install anything from the Play Store though in the restricted profile. When I open the Play Store from the restricted profile it says I don't have permissions for the app. So you don't have to worry about them installing apps. You install the apps you want them to have and then allow them in the restricted profile and that is all they will have access to.
ShieldAndroidTV,fm6ffx3,t1_fm6erc3,1585792871.0,"Yeah, I just tried Plex (I was watching the news before so didn't want to switch apps until it was over). The notification can control Plex like you said. I'm hoping this is just a bug and not an intended new feature."
ShieldAndroidTV,fm6ebjm,t3_ftclh1,1585792174.0,"I was surprised a couple hours ago that I got a casting notification for Live Channels on my Shield. The good news however is that the media controls in my phone's notification panel did not work at all in this case. I don't know if that is the same for you with Plex. But since people are expressing concern about that, thought I would add that in my case at least, the controls didn't work."
samsung,fm29kxp,t3_fsg4ue,1585693127.0,That doesn't include system data. Click on the 3 dots upper right and then Storage Settings. Then click on Internal Storage. You can see a further breakdown there.
tmobile,flyizc9,t1_flxxb96,1585603038.0,Since you are on an old prepaid plan you would need a new SIM. People on the current Simply Prepaid plans in the new prepaid system can switch online themselves without a new SIM. People on the old plans in the old system have to get new accounts in the new system. So you need a new SIM and have to transfer your number over to the new account.
tmobile,flxgkae,t1_flxfl1q,1585582474.0,That's what I suggested to someone else in a different thread who wanted to travel to Canada. And you actually do not lose the yearly additional Connect data if you do that. It's in the FAQ.

tmobile,flxbvqz,t1_flwu3ql,1585579778.0,"Yes. I used to be on that $30 plan. After several years,  I switched to Simply Choice and did that switch myself in my account.  


Then last year I switched to the current Simply Prepaid $40 plan and I had to go to a store to get a new SIM and new account set up in the Rebellion system and have my number ported to the new account. 


When the Connect plans came out a few days ago,  I was able to change to the $15 plan myself online again without any assistance or change in account/SIM since I was already in the new system."
tmobile,flwhfd5,t3_frk8hr,1585550772.0,"Not really sure what you are looking for people to tell you. The network is going to be the same and it's still prepaid. As long as you don't go over the data allotment and don't need international service your experience isn't going to be any different. 

If you do need more data you can purchase it but in your case it doesn't seem like you'll need more. Btw, you could have switched a long time ago (and still could) to the current $40 prepaid plan which has 10GB LTE data. 

I switched from the current $40 prepaid plan to the $15 Connect plan since I'm home now due to having to self-isolate and I'm on wifi almost all the time. Of course my experience on the new plan is no different than my experience on the previous plan at this point. Not sure what you were expecting."
tmobile,flvw8sm,t3_frgkro,1585533592.0,"The reason you'll have to get a new SIM and transfer your number is because you are on a plan that is on the old prepaid system. There is a new prepaid system now called Rebellion that is totally separate from the legacy system you are on.

Once you transfer to the new system you will not need to get a SIM again if you want to change to a different prepaid plan. For anyone who is already on the Rebellion prepaid system, they do not have to get a new SIM to get the Connect plan.

The Connect plans will be around for at least 5 years and 500MB additional data will be added for each of those first five years.

You already know about the data cap. You can purchase more data if you run out either by the day or the week. The only other thing you really need to be aware of is that there are no addons for international service."
ShieldAndroidTV,flvr1la,t1_flvhk0y,1585530093.0,"Well, I know when I set up mine a couple years ago, the minimum requirement was only 50GB. I don't know if that has changed at all since then because I have a 500GB hard drive attached so I wouldn't have gotten any warnings if it was raised. 

Just checking the troubleshooting basics here. Have you tried powering off and on again? Have you tried clearing cache in the app? Clearing data? (This will reset the app and you'll have to scan channels again.) Have you tried uninstalling updates to the app? Updating the app again after testing it on the previous version? Have you ejected your storage and and reattached it? Is it adopted internal storage? Are you making sure when you try to record that you are choosing a channel from the blue iconed Network Tuner and not the green iconed HDHomerun?

One other question. Are you in the US? I know when I set up mine only the US was supported but I don't know if other countries have been added since then. If you are in another country, try doing a search to see if your country is supported yet."
ShieldAndroidTV,flv7lur,t3_frdhtd,1585518062.0,"Yes and no. Yes, you can use the app Button Mapper to remap buttons on the Fire TV remote. No, you can not remap the voice button. 

As far as changing inputs on your TV, I believe you would need to use IR for that. While there are custom commands you can set in Button Mapper, I'm not personally familiar if you can use any of them to input an IR code for your TV.

The advanced functions for setting custom commands are:
Shell command. 
Broadcast intent.
Custom keycode (ver 1 & 2).
Tasker intent.
Open URL."
