depression,fdt9ziu,t3_ejsoej,1578713858.0,"Yeah, my guardians know I’m depressed and suicidal, but they keep leaving me out of outings, call me names like stupid, retarded and idiot and then blame me, call me whiny, tell me I’m angry instead of sad even though I tell them I’m sad, punish me for crying, and generally ignore my feelings. They threatened to Baker Act me and then don’t understand why I think they hate me."
