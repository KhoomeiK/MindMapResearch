She definitely needs to learn her lesson. This is just an awful way to do it. She ate a cake. A cake!  seems like I'm the only one who feels this way, but I just had to weigh in. Carry on."

My ex of 25 years took all our money and left me in extreme debt. I couldn't even get a credit card. Today, 6 years later, I am at peace. Life is not perfect, nor is it for anyone.  I am so incredibly grateful that I did not succeed in my life ending attempts. I did not believe all those who told me it would get better. I'm sure you wont believe me either. But, it does. Truth.  I will be thinking of you.  Peace my friend."

I often think that there was a reason I stopped at each attempt. Maybe somewhere in those awful days, there was some sort of a subliminal sign that life would be worth living some day.
