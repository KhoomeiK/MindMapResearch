Anxiety,fqhud78,t1_fqhu6yk,1589384748.0,"Wow that's great to hear that he's doing so well. I hope so too, thank you so much üòÅ"
Anxiety,fqhu5o4,t1_fqhtzph,1589384638.0,That's what I'm thinking/hoping. He doesn't have a fever which is a big positive. His work is having him stay home for 2 weeks even if he's negative to be safe.
Anxiety,fqhu07q,t1_fqhtsth,1589384557.0,Yeah I'm glad he had no issues getting tested. Luckily testing has gone way up in my state as of late. I appreciate the positive words! Luckily he's feeling pretty good right now just some throat pains.
Anxiety,fqhsi1u,t3_fnz5n3,1589383607.0,My husband got tested today and I'm trying not to completely lose my mind ‚òπÔ∏è. He woke up with uvulitis and a sore throat and now we're both isolating until the test comes back. Luckily they said it'll take only 2-3 days. Having anxiety just makes this whole situation so much worse.. I really appreciate this thread though. I don't post much because I'm super self conscious but everyone seems so supportive...
Anxiety,fmncwvz,t3_fw5q9i,1586223226.0,Every time!!! I feel like a need a long nap right after.
Anxiety,fkpk6kp,t3_fjobz7,1584412102.0,I'm the same way! That's why I haven't posted much even though I've been on Reddit for a while. It's a relief to see a group of people who feel the same way.
harrypotterwu,evg6xgo,t1_ernla40,1564506595.0,Sorry I just saw this comment now! Our phones are different so I guess it might have been a compatibility issue. I hope you got things working!
harrypotterwu,erniqt0,t1_ernhgj9,1561053544.0,Yup! My husband has the ability to download and I don't.. we're both in CT üôÅ
