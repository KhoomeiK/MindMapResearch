Same goes for you, just because you were under the influence does not give anyone the right to do that. I'm very sorry this happened to you.. the unknown aspects of what they did to me is degrading to say the least.

You are a strong mother who is on the path to healing, even though your path ahead of you is long and tough. You are an amazing person and deserve better. I'll pray for you if that's okay.. Keep moving forward away from your abuser, keep pushing and remember you did the right thing"
ptsd,fdn6hg4,t1_fdn5ett,1578578613.0,I wouldn't want to either.. keep it here in the depths of anonymous
rape,fdma2me,t3_em47ex,1578543603.0,"It's your mind playing tricks on you... A way to cope with it, trauma is hell. 
I got raped when I was 19 and now I'm obsessed with getting raped again. I don't know why our brains do this but they do.."
rape,fdm9q1y,t1_fdm6gcj,1578543341.0,Oh my... You need a good person to talk to hun. I can't help you remember but a therapist is good at getting that out. I'm so sorry.. it's a very scary not knowing what happened... Seek the truth if you are willing
rape,fdm9cze,t1_fdm8enr,1578543066.0,"The more you say it out loud the clearer it becomes, the more truth you will see. Most importantly... 
You are not over reacting trust me, and trust yourself. You came here for a reason didn't you? You already know it happened, you just need some help to call it what it is."
rape,fdm0weo,t3_em2k1f,1578537168.0,"That's horrible for a mom to do... I'm very sorry. Rape is not violent all the time, some of us freeze up and don't know what happened to us until later."
rape,fdm0d6p,t3_em2q7n,1578536808.0,"He's lying, he raped you and was trying to switch blame, this was rape, no doubt. I'm very glad you are past him. You need to acknowledge your traumas for what they were and progress forward, face it and help yourself in the process"

rape,fdlz9q8,t3_em0zwm,1578536057.0,"Hello, you were definitely raped, by who??? Hopefully the evidence will help with that, but if not therapy can dig deep into your brain and reach memories we block out. I once woke up after having a party in my house. Nothing on but a shirt, last thing I remember was a friend holding my hair while I was vomiting. The next morning I woke up and thought nothing of it, but my gut told me otherwise. I don't know what happened that night, and it makes me feel very small.. Always trust yourself with your gut. Be warned that if you confront anyone, be ready for some backlash and hurtful comments. There are those who just don't understand, and never will. But rest assured people like us feel your pain, and guilt, as do others who don't victim blame.
I'm very proud of you for going to get tested and filling a case. That in itself is an achievement! Keep doing positive and healthy actions in your life to stay safe"
