Anyway, they helped but not enough and my doctor switched me to Imuran in February. I was so upset and cried for days. It was a combination of things, including feeling like I hadn't done enough ... that if I had actually tried something like AIP or whatever, maybe I could have avoided this. I guess I'll never really know. My GI disagrees and believes that diet is so subjective for us but eating as healthy as we can and finding the right medication are the most important.  
So since February my symptoms have been greatly reduced and I'm feeling good about things. Although I'm not in remission... today for some reason I had a tiny bit of bleeding and mucus and that has just made me so incredibly frustrated! But it's a million times better than what it was.
