T Swift to me doesn't feel super Sag as she has a water moon and mercury and iirc a cap rising - her sun is her only Sag placement and she doesn't seem to have that light spontaneous side but still appears quite fun at times. And as with any astro stuff, because it's more of a blueprint rather than something set in stone, the person's morals play a big part in how the placements show themselves - Caroline is attention grabbing for all the wrong reasons, and where she believes herself to be charming she's actually just manipulative."

These people stayed up for a whole day to give something enjoyable and memorable to fans and help those in need at the same time. What has Caroline done to fundraise?

Definitely in the same camp as you RE. Absolutes. Even with my own illness my therapist is always reminding me not to completely box myself in as 'that's me, the bipolar girl!' because nothing is ever that black and white. Caroline's way of thinking is so completely primary school and lacks any space for flow, growth or, as we've mentioned, nuance. It's one of the things I find most frustrating about her. Something either IS or it ISN'T, and that is just not how life, humans, emotions or anything else works, but she for whatever reason has never been able to (or want to) acknowledge and work with that.

Things are going pretty okay for me at the moment, thank you for the kind thoughts! Sending you lots of love and hope you're doing alright too. 💕"
SmolBeanSnark,fp3pduu,t1_fp3gyct,1588283394.0,"1) She misappropriates mental illness terms constantly. Recovery while doing cocaine anyone?

2) MANIC IS ALSO A DESCRIPTIVE CAROLINE. 'Work was manic today', 'My dog's behaviour is a bit manic since we moved house'. I have full blown manic episodes and not once have I thought ""These bitches are misappropriating a term used for an aspect of my mental illness"" because 90% of the time it's manic-with-a-small-M. I personally wouldn't be surprised if she did have some form of mood disorder but utterly separate from that, her behaviour IS absolutely manic in the dictionary definition of the term. But our stupid fucking smol bean doesn't have the brain cells to understand nuance 🤷

Edit: Also, this sub is the only place - legit, the only place - I've talked about my suicide attempt, because I knew it would be safe to share and that I'd receive kindness. She thinks because we dislike her actions, we must be horrible people. But actually we're respectful of each other and supportive when a member of this sub shares something personal.

Fibromyalgia,fp39yui,t3_gaxncf,1588275664.0,"I found a very interesting article a few months back linking fibro and abusive relationships and have never felt so seen. My symptoms started 4-5 months after I left my abusive relationship and I had never thought of connecting the two events but it makes SO much sense. When I argue with someone or someone shouts at me it triggers a fibro episode from the stress of feeling like I'm back in the rship. It's such an obvious link but I'd never considered it before. I think there can also be a link between fibro and childhood abuse for some people, if I remember correctly.

Sometimes I get so angry at my ex partner for traumatising me to the point he triggered a physical illness, but my father has chronic fatigue syndrome so I may have developed it anyway.

I was listening to their old albums the other day and wondering why I felt a much lesser connection to the more recent offerings and I think OP is right, it's the personal experience behind the songs. They're no longer a little band chasing a dream, they've reached their dream now, and they got out of their washed up town. Those early years felt so personal - to me it always felt like they could have been my friends trying to make it big with their lil local band. As they've found their (well-deserved) success they've felt a little more and a little more further away - I feel similarly about Don Broco, though imo they're a bit more consistent with putting out bangers. Fingers crossed ADTR find another groove and despite having very different life experiences nowadays will manage to hit the mark again, cause they're A+ musicians. Thanks for the interesting post :)

In her horrible twisted way, I reckon she might have, whether consciously or subconsciously, taken inspiration from it, as we all know she reads here. Utterly gross and exploitative either way."

SmolBeanSnark,fm8y5o6,t1_fm803ml,1585858191.0,"Exactly. I had a friend who was like this, but with a nicer character and far less intentionally manipulative. She genuinely had a huge heart but the attention she demanded from me once I moved into best friend status was just completely insane for me to be able to keep up with. It was so difficult to realise that no amount of love and attention I gave her would be enough and that I had to let her go. I hate that some people are like that and can't appreciate the love they DO have, it's such a waste of time and energy for all involved."

SmolBeanSnark,fm4wcyg,t1_fm4s1dd,1585762012.0,"A huge part of my feminism (and I'm sure this goes for the rest of the sub too) is wanting women to be better versions of themselves, partly to stick it to The Man, but mostly for ourselves, and for each other. It's about learning and personal growth. Blind acceptance has NO place in feminism and never has - if I don't blindly accept the way society is, why on earth would I blindly accept the careless and harmful actions of other women? She is once again using buzzwords to discredit genuine criticism, and I notice she never acknowledges the number of us who say here regularly that we WANT her to learn and grow and become her better self; that we'd be really happy if she just acknowledged she's been a wanker and chose to grow the fuck up."
amiugly,flwziww,t3_frlle4,1585570864.0,"If you're not averse to dyeing your hair/eyebrows I'd suggest a light brown would suit your skin tone a lot more and break up the colour from your hair to your face - strawberry blonde although a wonderful shade can sometimes make us look redder than we actually are, and darker shades take that redness out. :) And flicking the front of your hair back into something that looks [a bit more like this](https://www.google.com/search?q=brown+hair+fringe+back+mens+haircut&client=ms-android-hmd-rev2&prmd=ivsn&sxsrf=ALeKk02TirkCs7A7yEyVPcIalWA2PpEy-g:1585570742303&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8w_Gml8LoAhUWE8AKHbbxDf4Q_AUoAXoECA4QAQ&biw=360&bih=560&dpr=3#imgrc=5_y2R7wJTXWhxM) will flatter your face shape in a way that a fringe going straight down won't. It's so simple but a change of hairstyle works wonders, I promise. From there I reckon you'll have a confidence boost that can help you encourage yourself to make more changes. Like others have said, you aren't ugly and have a nice face - it's just a bit hidden by your hair! Good luck man!"
buffy,flsirk1,t1_fls29ex,1585443060.0,"Thank you for the kind tone of your comment, I appreciate it.

It was really just a misunderstanding from some people on a previous post that I took it upon myself to try and clear up - to be honest I really didn't figure this sub was that big and I assumed that most people would see the same posts! I'm not in America so when a post makes it big, by the time I go to comment it's about 12h later and doesn't get seen, which sucks cause I want to join in the convos. Normally I don't involve myself in this way but because it was to do with my community I felt I had to explain/defend it, which I guess some people will see as unnecessary, but some (like you) seem to understand.

Anyway, hope you're doing well in the current craziness, and thanks again for how you worded your comment, it really made a difference."
buffy,flrfb4q,t1_flrcsor,1585419021.0,"Ok mate. You're making yourself sound worse with each comment so please feel free to continue, but I won't be looking anymore."
buffy,flrep7i,t1_flrdbct,1585418673.0,"I'm not defending anyone in particular, it was a crosspost from another sub and OP wasn't involved in the Buffy thread at all; I'm explaining the context of the joke in case any of the people who DID see the post and misunderstood might see this. My comments on the post were getting a bit buried so I thought I might be better off making a separate one.

Edit: if my tone of voice sounds pissed off it's not, I wasn't being grumpy with you! That's just how I sound lol"
buffy,flr92iu,t1_flr8rjg,1585415465.0,"I don't know how to link on here, sorry - earlier today there was a video from a comedian cross posted from an LGBTQ sub about realising he was gay because of Buffy, which some straight people have taken issue with for some reason. If you scroll down in the sub I think it's from a few hours ago"
buffy,flr61po,t1_flqrbv3,1585413710.0,"'Bent'? Excuse me?

You're choosing to misunderstand what I'm explaining to you, which was that this was a joke about being gay and loving Buffy for gay people who love Buffy to laugh at. That's why you don't find it funny. We are all aware of the fact it's a universal show that appeals to so many different people. The gay community is one of them, which is what this joke is about. Straight people taking offence to a long running inside joke that isn't even about them is astounding to me"
buffy,flqmwqv,t1_flqfrwn,1585400502.0,"I've said this above, but - it's not that liking the show is 'gay', it's that we gays tend to like the show and it's a fairly long running joke in the community."
buffy,flqmgfs,t1_flq4k9s,1585400084.0,"The joke isn't that liking the show in itself is 'gay', just that us gays tend to like the show. A whole bunch of kids who were struggling with their identities growing up found a place in Buffy, and that's become a bit of an inside joke in the community. Willow and Tara's relationship was obviously a huge thing for a lot of us and Cordelia is considered something of a queer icon because her attitude, but nobody says the show is just for the LGBTQ community or that straight guys can't like it lol.

E: I'm confused as to why my explanation is being downvoted. It was a gay joke from a gay comedian meant to make other gay people laugh. I...can't understand what's upsetting about that"
