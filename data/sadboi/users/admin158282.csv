First it felt better (my hppd), then  went thru a phase where it felt so much worse (like really bad) after that phase you break thru and start feeling normal again. This happened to me and other people I have talked too. sometimes you gotta stick thru, but if you really have a gut feeling you should just do what feels right to you. good luck to u bro!"
HPPD,fpj5t96,t3_gdrtr8,1588657450.0,Oh u haven't experienced severe hppd bud
schizophrenia,fp002a2,t1_fozthhv,1588199961.0,"&#x200B;

schizophrenia,foziq73,t1_foxpba0,1588191333.0,did u realize u were hearing stuff

HPPD,fn25jvw,t3_fyhneh,1586578442.0,"I get this this a lot, I think it's anxiety. definitely not schizo. I also get a feeling where it feels like water drops fall on my skin"
HPPD,fmvcw6s,t3_fx1tj5,1586412717.0,painkillers like codeine pills affect my hppd lots so be careful
HPPD,fmvbksu,t1_fmu60hl,1586411549.0,yes yes exactly what u said! I got really bad hppd to so

HPPD,flfiwis,t3_foabgw,1585107759.0,ap helped me. I got prescribed resperidone yesterday and I. currently seeing how it helps. I was on seurequel for a few months and it helped a lot. then I decided to smoke while on it an that didn't end well so I had to get prescribed another medication
HPPD,fktbw6s,t3_fkf764,1584513195.0,50mg is too high of a starting dose for seurequel. escpesially when u only have hppd
HPPD,fktbsab,t3_fkjw4w,1584513072.0,probably hppd
HPPD,fkgew7r,t1_fkgcfqn,1584157665.0,I have had the same weed experience ! I basically had a 2 hour panic attack!hearing voices seeing intense visuals.
HPPD,fkgetjh,t1_fkgcfqn,1584157603.0,I think that's just a bad anxiety based weed high not physcosis. physcosis is a intense mental illness that doesn't only occur when on a substance
HPPD,fkgc1d3,t3_fi5csg,1584155362.0,what was the physcosis talk about? Did u mean drug physcosis?
HPPD,fkcykpg,t3_fhlbe1,1584064148.0,i dont reccommend because i recovered like 98% and weed brought all my symtoms back and also increased my audio haullacanations
HPPD,fkcyerp,t3_fhfk2l,1584064038.0,same but im also trying to find sonethibg to help it
HPPD,fkcyb8f,t1_fkcirja,1584063973.0,I guess Xanax  helped but don't recommend because if addiction
HPPD,fkcd834,t1_fkbq0x5,1584050625.0,I got over myself
HPPD,fkbg46k,t1_fka8ynh,1584032364.0,"I got it after a lsd trip. it took a couple months to get over it. I don't remeber how much times a day, if I estimated prolly like 15+ times a day"
HPPD,fka3t1v,t3_fhbhgp,1583991506.0,yes I developed a sort of anxiety/OCD tic from LSD but I got over it!
HPPD,fka3nkk,t1_fk9594y,1583991355.0,I agree when I take a break from Reddit it makes my anxiety so much better. I was honestly going down hill from when I was on Reddit 24/7
HPPD,fka3j46,t3_fgx9gj,1583991228.0,yes very bad anxiety
HPPD,fka3fwp,t3_fh6roa,1583991139.0,"yes I'm going thru the same phase with audio haullacanations and wierd visuals like shadow people. I have taken seurequel and it has been perfect it helped me lots and basically cured me and 99% of my visuals and do! Until obviously I smoked weed on seurequel and now I'm back to sq1. I don't recommend smoking or seurequel because first of I can't take it anymore because it doesn't have any effect ( idk why but I guess it because of the mixture with drugs) and second of it gives you tittunus Ã—100 when u smoke on sequel. it's a really bad experience just don't do it. You will recover as long as you stay healthy and stick with your doctors advice! trust me don't do drugs anymore! never! maybe alcohol later in life, but that's it! Good luck to u man...!"
HPPD,fk4ypid,t3_fgeavj,1583870157.0,"ye but it went away. it used to be around all parts of my brain (back, front and sides"

HPPD,fjohy6b,t1_fjmuv5n,1583528109.0,"Like shadows, visual snow, tracers, after images, etc"
HPPD,fjml66z,t1_fjj8cbe,1583473926.0,you can do drug but you just have a risk in doing it so j would in my opinion. but whatever your choice is up to you! I'm just trying to help you out man! Good luck to you
HPPD,fjj8a08,t1_fjj564l,1583386235.0,I'm not in your shoes so o won't k ow how u cope and deal with it. it can go away faster if you find a medication that works for you and start a healthy routine. mdma help my symtoms but I don't recommend it because it can fuck it up. all around I just recommend to quit drugs before it fuck you up. you don't need these harmful drugs all they do is mess you up. quit drugs to better your future all around. all I'm saying is once you open ur hppd hole in your brain it will always open  back up if you do drugs but if you don't it will close!
HPPD,fji5ol7,t1_fji4fd3,1583361024.0,what do you mean?

HPPD,fjgzyvq,t3_fdaki8,1583338753.0,you probably have to stay away from drugs since it does look like hppd. if you continue drugs the symtoms will increase I've time and ur life will be hell
HPPD,fjgzqfb,t1_fjg39bm,1583338641.0,I was on seurequel 25mg but I can't take it anymore because smoking on it made the med not work for me!

HPPD,fjf4784,t3_fd4nyr,1583283947.0,the light sensitivity is dp/dr because i get the same but like both light and sound sensitivity. The wall breathing does sound like hppd but I dont want t o diagnose you soo.... hppd usually takes a few weeks/ months to settle in fully (at least for me)
HPPD,fjf3q60,t3_fd4ekm,1583283657.0,"yes, i have this. but for me it can also happen when  im looking at screens and shit (basically when im looking at anything). it usually happens when im really focused like when im kind of relaxed and shit."
HPPD,fjdutox,t1_fjdtlom,1583259685.0,"yes I guess I can consider myself lucky. yeah it mostly all came b.a k because my weed experience felt like my mushroom trip, and mushrooms and weed is what causes all this shit so it makes sense! Good luck to you hopefully you can recover!"
HPPD,fjdsnm7,t1_fjdsfje,1583258470.0,few months but the meds I took helped.  I'll say my visuals are maybe the same or slightly more I tense/different my dp/Dr is way better. but my anxiety thoughts and depression is much worse
