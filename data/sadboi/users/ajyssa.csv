Technically the movie isn’t about that but the process of watching the movie is what a delusion feels like. Trying to figure out the plot. Finding hidden clues and meanings to understand what’s going on. How his actions have a bigger meaning and how he can manipulate time. That movie has a special meaning to me because I watched it at peak episode. It highly resonated with me and what I was going through at the time. Thought it was sending me messages you know the drill.
schizophrenia,fe5qz4g,t3_enp4lc,1578873289.0,"To me Donnie Darko is the closest thing to psychosis I’ve watched. Not just the content but the process of watching the movie is how it feels.

Also check out unsane on amazon. Hits real close to home if you’ve had a stay at a psych ward."

To me the aftermath of psychosis is the hardest part. When your in the midst of an episode the only things that matter are the delusions and hallucinations. But now that you are more stable you have to put the pieces back together. What is reality? What relationships did I hurt? How will people react to me now? Etc.
