I much like everyone above have severe anxiety along with manic depression episodes, ocd & ptsd. I work a corporate job with deadlines and goals. I donâ€™t use my disorders as an excuse and it pisses me off that others do. Iâ€™ve had these issues for over a decade due to several traumas and past jobs have got to me I wonâ€™t lie. Not everyone understands or accepts mental illness but it also doesnâ€™t help when itâ€™s a self diagnosing situation. I have quit a job over mental health but it was a healthy move on my part in the end. Also if she truly had these moments prior to working for you she should of been an adult and had a side talk to let you know. I have been with my current company for over two years. A little after my first year I started to get flare ups again when I found out I had an immune disorder. I did not hide it and I told my manager everything I was comfortable sharing at that time. She gave me the best advice and helped me get intermittent FMLA. My psychiatrist was completely on board and my job was also recommending I do it for myself. I get a few free days now and it wonâ€™t risk my attendance because I was upfront with everything. Thatâ€™s the way it should be."

Sneakers,fj2182b,t1_fj1sjqi,1582932247.0,There is but Iâ€™ve searched everything even the QR and it doesnâ€™t show up. They are EQTs and Iâ€™ve found ones almost like them but mine have gold font details and thatâ€™s what I never could pinpoint.
Sneakers,fj1ovdv,t3_fatlhm,1582924566.0,10/10 would of copped. I have some adidas that I randomly found at a TJ Maxx (legit must of been some back room random hidden find type of shit) a sick pair of adidas and I get more people asking me about a pair of $25 adidas then $200 ones. I canâ€™t find the exact pair online tho and it drives me crazy. I have no idea if they were from a colab or what they were going for originally.

thyroidhealth,fj1khh4,t1_fj1i45i,1582921960.0,"i had the whole right side of my thyroid removed and they will tell you right then if it tested positive for cancer or they should of at least. During my surgery they froze part and took it to be tested immediately because if it was they were going to remove the entire thing. It was also sent out and tested a second time. This was after two prior FNA's that came back as it being a ""possibility but not confirmed"" which is why it had to be removed."

    Fuck her and her kids. If she always calls out of work then thereâ€™s no way her kid is always that sick. If so and your work offers FMLA she should apply for that. I have 3 cats and Iâ€™d call out of work immediately if one was sick and I have before more than once. You did the right thing for your own fur baby."
mentalhealth,finl1ip,t1_fimfedf,1582565274.0,you are an amazing human and i hope your girlfriend knows how lucky she is to have someone help them during attacks like that. It also made me laugh and i am having a very down day so thank you.
AmItheAsshole,fif2u22,t1_fiept9m,1582385075.0,"Itâ€™s only getting worse. I might sound old but I graduated 14 years ago and nothing like that ever happened at my high school. I donâ€™t know where the whole trend began and while itâ€™s a sweet gesture, itâ€™s not a smart idea. Hence the position OP was put in with all of this."
AmItheAsshole,fif25g5,t1_fie26az,1582384837.0,100% agreed. It probably would of made their lives worse.

ghibli,eptfnti,t1_epsv0ad,1559489202.0,Thank you! Honestly he had only seen a few Ghibli movies when I first met him but his fiancÃ©e has made him watch all of them. Heâ€™s also done my Kikiâ€™s and Totoro tattoos. Heâ€™s extremely talented. I just gave him the still image from the movie and what I had in my head and he drew the whole design.
