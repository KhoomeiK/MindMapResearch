ActualPublicFreakouts,fqzzurh,t3_gltyo9,1589779702.0,"I read a tweet recently that sums up the attitude that people like this have. It went something like: 

“Men have given their lives and fought in wars to keep their fellow Americans safe, but you can’t sit at home and watch TV for a month, or even wear a mask in public to protect your fellow Americans.” 

Shame on you. 

The longer this goes on, the more lives are lost and the more our economy suffers. Just fucking wear a mask."

AmItheAsshole,fo2auu9,t3_g5297m,1587455483.0,"NTA because in every class I’ve ever been in, on the first day everyone goes around and introduces themselves with their name and how they want it pronounced. Especially what name they want to go by. It’s just basic respect to call someone what they wish to be called. 

It’s kind of similar to if someone is named John Apple Smith and I call him John, when he wants to go by his middle name. It’s mean and insensitive. I would disregard it the first few times because people might not know/remember, but after that if they keep doing it they are being rude just to be rude to you. I wouldn’t take that shit. Maybe get the school board involved?"
insaneparents,fnxri1a,t3_g4ezru,1587344839.0,"Don’t most medical doctors recommend that newborn babies get a vitamin K shot, or the oral liquid?

EDIT: Yep I was right! I think I heard this in school. But here’s a link referencing the CDC on why all babies are recommended to get vitamin K at birth, and why those parents are f**king idiots.  Apparently most babies are born with low vitamin K levels and bleeding complications can happen before anyone notices.

BPD,fnnhcyy,t1_fnnfhub,1587092398.0,"Wow crazy I’ve been taking this for over three months. And the anger really was just my period because after that, I started tracking my moods and it is always worse around my period. 

As far as lamotrigine working for me, it has honestly been night and day for my mental health. I still do have highs and lows, but they are not nearly as extreme as they were. I’m not wasting my days crying in bed anymore. It just makes it easier to be happy and not focus on the negative. But damn! My extreme mood swings are so much better. For the spiraling in my head part though, that is something I’ve conditioned myself to do for years and I’m working on that. Lamotrigine won’t fix the bad thoughts I have about myself, it only fixed the mood swings that come from them, that made me have episodes. 

 So it’s not a miracle drug for me, but it made me be able to control my emotions better to make my highs not too high, and my lows not too low. 

While taking this I am also in DBT therapy still, which is also a process. And I think it is so much more beneficial for me to be doing both therapy and medication to really get better from BPD, instead of one or the other. But everyone is different. 

I think DBT has helped me equally because I’ve learned skills that help me be more mindful of what my triggers are, and how to better interact with people. But I’m still working on the interaction part, and just implementing DBT practice into my life, cause it’s one thing to know the skills but another to actively use them, and that’s one of my biggest problems to overcome right now. But as far as lamotrigine goes, it’s really helped with the BPD recovery process."

BPD,fgu7isj,t3_f0h09p,1581114431.0,"I actually started this medication 3 days ago, today I took my 4th dose. I’m on 25mg for 2weeks, then 50mg for 2weeks, then 100mg. 

My psychiatrist said that the rash is really rare, but they display the warning label for the rash prominently because the rash will move to your mucus membranes, and that can’t be good. But I think it’s rare. She said since she’s been practicing psychiatry, she hasn’t had someone develop the rash. She is building me up on it so the rash is less likely to happen I guess? And also lessen side effects probably. 

On this medication so far, I actually feel kind of worse. I’m quick to anger more than usual and I’ve had a lot of fits of crying. I’m just now getting into tracking my mood though, and I don’t know if this is just typical for me to have worse bpd symptoms close to my period, or if it’s because the lamotrigine. 


I didn’t know about blindness? Is it permanent? What is the prevalence? 

Honestly with so many things that can go wrong with this drug, idk if it’s worth it. But out of all the mood stabilizers, this one seems the safest to start out, that’s what my psychiatrist said. I’m scared too.

EDIT: I didn’t mention, when she was telling me about the rash, she said you will notice it. Like really notice it if you start to get it, just because it happens so fast I guess? She said stop taking it and it will go away on its own. But I have never had any skin conditions other than dry skin/acne. Maybe just call your doctor up and tell them your concerns, and make yourself be heard. Doctors can be dismissive sometimes."

mentalhealth,fabuqbi,t3_e85b72,1575929134.0,"So there is a shortage of mental health services and funding across the United States, across the world really. Especially in middle- and low-income countries. It all has to do with how mental health isn’t as valued. 

Untreated mental illness disproportionally affects the poor, hinders personal economic growth, and is often overlooked because many times there are no physical symptoms. 

Here is a link that kind of explains the reasoning behind the shortage, and what institutions are doing to help curve that shortage: 

https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/addressing-escalating-psychiatrist-shortage 

The shortage is important because it adds stress to existing mental health resources and facilities that are serving large numbers of populations, more than their facility was meant for. This drives care quality down, leading to less one-on-one patient time with the mental health professional to make room for other patients, and adds wait times."
