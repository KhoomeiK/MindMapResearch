rem,fok1roh,t3_g7vwfe,1587833771.0,"Feedback: the music is great. The bass playing really stands out. The vocals, though, are sometimes flat and don’t sit well in the mix. They slide around the notes. Not horrible, though. Some vocal processing can fix that up. Punch your words. Quarter notes. Eighth notes. Half notes. Like hitting keys on a piano. 

Also, lead singer, match the emotion of the song with your physicality. Ever notice how when Stipe sings this song he *looks* emotionally tortured? His physical behavior (including expressions) matches the mood of the song. And so we believe him as the song’s primary character/narrator. And we want to watch him. Do this. Identify what you think the primary emotion of the song is, and then become that emotion. If Stipe looked/acted the same when he sang “Everybody Hurts” as he does for “Shiny Happy People” it would be very awkward!

Keep in mind that there are only a handful of emotions to master as lead singer: anger, sadness, joy, love, fear and no emotion. Learn how to play each one. Make your audience feel with you. Michael Jackson does it. Michael Stipe does it. Tina Turner does it. Every good singer does it. 

One last lead singer note: Don’t fidget and move around! Try this: identify three points in your room to look at. Preferably in front of you. But it could be down somewhere, or up. But just three points. Now, you can only look at those three points. You can’t look anywhere else. And you can’t move. Moving is distracting and makes you look not confident. Put your hands somewhere and keep them there. The only exception is if you are doing gestures or dance moves which *compliment* the emotion or theme of the song. Like moving your arms up during the song’s climax. But it has to be natural for maximum emotional impact. 

Hope that helps! Lead singer is a daring, bold and frightening role. But you can do it! Send me version 2–!"

Study his music. His composition. He writes these beautiful melodies and I’m guessing often on a piano. Minor keys and all. Especially songs like “Talk”, “Viva la Vida”, “A Message”, etc.  As piano pieces they are incredible. And complex. But it’s just not the stuff that rock music is written off. No three -chord power chord progressions, no sort of attitude in the lyrics that the rock genre demands. It doesn’t quite fit, so it’s  interpreted as being soft or weak. 

That bring said, when I heard “Sky Full of Stars” being used as background music on “American Idol” I wanted to choke.
