I would get them a lot before getting it and had more during my break than I do with it in. Other than that, maybe went back to carrying more weight in my hips and less in my stomach? That was a gradual subtle change I noticed while on the implant and it took about 3-4 months to go back to normal. Idk if that was all in my head though? Because I haven't noticed that change this time around."

Took a year break from BC after those 4 years. The second time around on the implant I've had no spotting. I've gotten 3 periods so far after being on the implant for 8 months. Haven't gotten my period now since Jan."

Maybe the newest fanciest one, but we all know that's not the smartest financial move in the first place. The real issue is when you need it NOW but don't have the money. That should be the rare situation when loans are needed, but our economic system takes advantage and pushes loans on anyone who has some down payment available.

I think the biggest issue with homes is that they're treated as investment. Of course no one can afford to outright buy property for themselves if it's constantly increasing in price by design. Unless work is being actively done on a property, shouldn't it realistically be decreasing in price over a short-term span of time? The only thing increasing in value is the overall improvements happening to a neighborhood/town/city over time. Yet real estate is looked at something that must be ever increasing (""ideally"" !!??) even if there's no tangible value being produced.
