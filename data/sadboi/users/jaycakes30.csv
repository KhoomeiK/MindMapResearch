You say you're 20, that is so young! You have years to settle down yet! Many mistakes to make, terrible choices but you will find that someone eventually! Romance doesn't work the way TV and movies shows, there aren't many people out there, with bpd or not, that find their soulmate in high school and live happily ever after."

Be firm, tell her what she has done has crossed too many lines and insist she leaves. If she tries to emotionally manipulate you by crying, which is exactly what she's doing, stick to your guns and if she still refuses you have every right to call the police.
