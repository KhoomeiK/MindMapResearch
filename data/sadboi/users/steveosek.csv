My injury was at 13. I'm now 33. So 20 years of memory loss basically. I didn't realize how much I'd lost until almost 30. I also strangely lost my ""urban"" accent I natively had from where I grew up, and to this day talk with almost a slight southern drawl mixed with Tom waits' voice, despite having never lived in the south. I hit my frontal lobe or whatever pretty hard. Apparently when it happened, I kept repeating the same question over and over for like, 2 hours, and then went into some kind of a coma for a day. The only thing I remember from that time is waking up in the hospital and wondering where I was. That's it."
instantkarma,fqlvx9s,t1_fqlp1wr,1589467056.0,"I am an entirely different person now than I even was 6 years ago, I continue to lose memory still, like my brain deletes old stuff to make room for new stuff. I'm 33, my short term memory is fine, my long term memory is a mess though. My doc even says a cte/alzheimers situation is very likely for me later in life. I was going at least 40mph on my skateboard and it flew out from under me and I went face first into the concrete. Major road rash, MAJOR concussion. I took a direct hit to center left(my left) of my frontal lobe. My family has no idea I can't remember anything before adulthood, I remember them, I haven't seen them in 6 years, but I remember them, from as an adult. Most of my childhood is gone, well, more like locked away. I can't access it on my own, but sometimes someone or something can trigger a lost memory of sorts, it's hard to describe.

Im honestly not too down about it. I moved to live near my cousin who has been a sister to me since we were in diapers. She knows my situation and is a nurse and has been such a huge part of figuring out who the hell I am, as after that injury in my teens, things got really fragmented and my identity was screwed. I owe who I am today to her, we're still so close. Her and her kids have been an anchor in my life as I figured out who I was and how to live around my issues. I'm still fairly absent minded at times, but stability in my life now has been a blessing. I don't identify with my parents or siblings anymore and they don't know that. I've more or less been adopted into my aunt and cousin's family."
