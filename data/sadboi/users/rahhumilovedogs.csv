zoloft,fdcg578,t3_ekhdvj,1578274072.0,"Yes, I get these. I mix the the two as well. I once woke up mid punch and it resulted in a swing, punching my dog. I wake up mid yell and it makes me finish the yell as I wake up. Its been going on a while and ive yet to find a solution. Was never like that before zoloft / melatonin mix.
