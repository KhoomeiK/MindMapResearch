I just signed up for a 5K in 7 weeks and am on my way out the door now to start my first workout. I also really struggle with food. It’s my drug.

bipolar,fclosqw,t3_ehsz1r,1577752835.0,"Same thing. So hard accepting, but this community has helped with that a lot. No one really thinks I have it since everyone thinks it means your either manic or suicidal and that’s it. Me too until finishing this group. I’ve literally never had a medical professional tell me anything very useful about the disease. They just all seem to want to make sure I’m not suicidal and that’s it. It’s really nice to know that all of my struggles over the years have a reason now, and the yes, we’re still autonomous humans, but so much of the emotion and reaction to the world around me has been through the lens of bipolar that until recently I thought was all my fault. My fault when people left me, my fault when I wasn’t good enough, my fault for not being able to “just be happy with what I have” as one of my best friends told me. Welcome to the group. You’re among friends 🙂"
bipolar,fclo7jy,t3_ehpox1,1577752434.0,Hang in there. This world needs you in it. You’re amazingly strong and resilient for making it this far in the face of so much pain. You’ve got this.
bipolar,fclnza8,t3_ehnmw9,1577752278.0,"I’m so sorry, I totally identify. At my annual review my boss told me basically that I’m great, but according to the company average I have way too many absences. I basically used all my sick time, which is apparently frowned upon. Most of it due to depression and not being able to force myself out of bed. It makes me “unreliable”. Really pisses me off... companies who tell you one thing and then act another way. Oh yeah, we value our employees, we have all these great benefits! Hey, you used those benefits, that makes you a bad employee. He did “promote” to a harder job with way more responsibility though... with no raise in pay. 🙄 I keep telling myself to be happy to have a steady job with a mostly great work environment after getting fucked by a place I worked for 14 years when I had my first manic episode. My position was eliminated after I was on medical leave for two months. No FMLA protection at that job. I should probably have sued for wrongful termination but didn’t know what the hell was happening for months. Anyway, a lot about me, sorry. Hang in there and keep up the good work. Also know that you are worth being treated well. As scary as change can be if things don’t get better then move on to a place that treats you well."

They’d be a little understanding but get tired of being supportive. I know it’s hard to understand when you’ve not lived it. But it’s so hard to feel so alone, and like it’s something that’s going to just get better."

bipolar,fck4qpo,t3_ehldvj,1577716548.0,"I never had an issue taking them in the past, but now can’t take anything since they all interact with my lamictal. After a week of taking OTC cold/flu meds I was so foggy and drowsy I was barely functional. Not one doctor has ever addressed that with me. I even asked the pharmacist if there would be interaction and they said no. After multiple experiences with trying to take allergy meds of all kinds and cold/flu I have determined that the internet med stuff is all wrong when they say no drug interaction with lamictal for these meds. So annoying. Not sure if it’s just me being hypersensitive to them, or this happens to a lot of people and is under reported, or if we do report and are just assumed to be crazy so the docs don’t report."

bipolar,fa0wyaj,t3_e7l0zh,1575761427.0,I think we’re all on a spectrum like Autism and gender. That’s why this is so hard. There’s not neat little buckets for us. I also believe I suffer for severe PTSD from 20 years of abuse and then being hospitalized almost killed me. Glad you got some good news and found such an amazing doctor.
bipolar,fa0w917,t3_e7k2oz,1575761262.0,"Yes, immediate sleep is critical for you. Do you have a place you can call for emergency meds? And someone to be with you?

I had a horrible time with medical treatment. Ended up hospitalized because my dr didn’t educate me enough or get me on aggressive enough meds soon enough. That on top of being in an abusive marriage and work environment on top of a lot of other things. This reset thing is helping immensely. The thing I feel is that we are each a very special bipolar snowflake and we’re all sort of adrift in a world that doesn’t really understand us. Even the professionals. They do their best, but they’ll never know what it’s like. Hang in there. You can do this. Find people who know you and support you no matter what. For me that’s my family and a very small handful of friends who survived the fallout from my mental breakdown. Sending love 💗"
