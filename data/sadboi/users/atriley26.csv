depression,ff3kyg7,t1_ff2ikl7,1579543259.0,"Oh wow...that is so odd that you don't have extra support available at the school. Like I said, it is different compared to the states. 

Do you have any professional support outside of school available like a therapist? I'm not sure how the culture over there is like with mental health.

As for feeling like an outsider with your family and everyone, that is really normal for your age. Trust me everyone has their own set of problems. I'm feeling like you're thinking everyone is better and smarter. But really nobody isn't perfect. I felt that that way constantly for a long time. When I was in high school, ugh I knew I was book smart but not test smart. Like my brother in law, he hated studying and he failed everything. He passed all of his tests lol. He has an high IQ but just couldn't function in a classroom setting. 

Anyways, I'm just saying try not to compare yourself to everyone else. It's hard not to I know. As for your life can be miserable comment, honestly it's different levels at different stages in life to feel miserable. I do remember feeling like a utter failure in high school, but I got through it barely lol. College is so much better than high school in my opinion. Just do your best to pass high school and move on to college. When applying for a job, they won't even look at your high school records like grades and crap like that. Just keep that in mind. If you want to chat more, just pm me."
depression,ff1r5jm,t3_er38fy,1579484365.0,"That is a different environment compared to the states. First things first, you're 16. You are so so young. High school is a very small portion of your life. I know how you feel. High school is a very stressful and why it is? I don't know why, but it is seriously a joke that it has to be that way. As for the academic issues, do you have an advisor to talk to? The new teacher you mentioned needs to be reported for treating students like that. And is there a way to drop a class to lessen your workload? There is no shame in that. Students work at different paces. You need to talk to a school official like a counselor or advisor to help you and work on how to feel better about school. I did that a lot in high school and I'm glad I did because I would have given up. News flash..I did that again in college to keep my ass on the right track. As for outside of school, you need to learn out to get your stress levels and mind centered by either yoga or running or swimming etc. I didn't do that in highschool but I did a lot in college. Also, listen to your mom. She is so right. Talk to her about what she went through in school and how she managed it. If you need to talk more, I'll be over here lol."
