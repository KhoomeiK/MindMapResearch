depression,eohjadm,t3_brsy1y,1558583066.0,"Yes. The key is always to remember that your mind is shitting the bed, do the exact opposite of what it says. At first you will succumb but later with more experience you will build discipline that will beat it. You might still have a shitty mindset but with the help of discipline you'll make tremendous progress that months before that you wouldn't even imagine would happen. And yet still, even after all that, you will feel like shit, but when looking into the eyes of progress, you'll understand how deceptive depression is, feel better and keep pushing. 

That's how the cycle always plays for me. Though with time the effects of depression are weakening and less cultivating than before."
