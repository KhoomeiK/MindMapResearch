My first freelance writing gig was writing daily news stories. I got paid crap for it, but it was an amazing bootcamp for freelance writing. I wrote 100+ articles in three months before I burned out. 

As for reference styles your client will tell you and, of course, read their content. Typically, I do inline references (link to the reference). But with authoritative medical content, I may have a very brief reference section at the end.

You will need to tell your editor about your sources (name, email address/phone) when doing interviews.

Melissa's interesting because she's so versatile (elegant food, pasta, vegetarian, Korean food), but she didn't seem to yet garner the respect of a ""great chef."" I agree that she lacks a ""wow"" factor, but as the challenges get harder, perhaps she'll takes some risks that gain notice.

As for Kevin, I can't get Michael Voltaggio's insults out of my head. I was rooting for Kevin in Season 6 and I think he can win All Stars. But I think he needs to surprise the judges this season, so they they don't just think of him as the same as back then.  

Bryan is a frontrunner, but he's so amiable and flat. He's so controlled -- it would be nice if he had some sort of breakthrough where he tried something new and it came out well, or even flopped. I'd love to see him have a Hung smurf moment at a Quickfire.

You'll discover alignment during the interviews and email chat. Your company's existing content, branding, and PR is something a good writer will have researched. They will be able to tell stories from their prior work and tie it to yours.

Also, know yourself! Take a minute to write your strengths/weaknesses in your managerial style. If you know yourself well, you'll be able to assess if a writer's skills are aligned. Writers are pretty adaptable, and unless you are extremely controlling or change your mind every 15 seconds, it'll probably work out.

Pay and benefits are important, but writers are also creatives. If you foster a creative environment, you'll attract better writers. Of course, remote work is a massive plus in this day and age. Writers don't produce as well in a cubicle in a noisy office. 

Why pay an agency to hire? Can your startup afford the markup fees? Many of those agencies just scrape LinkedIn for candidates and don't seem to offer value. Sorry, I'm a little salty about staffing agencies because, as a writer, they usually treat me poorly.

I write contract and grant proposals for a living and have worked with a lot of companies and not-for-profits. I work primarily in healthcare and there's a wide range of contract opportunities, including COVID-19, available. 

Even though contract info is free, there's a lot of intelligence you need that is not free and hard to find. You should try to learn who's applying and assess your approximate chances.  

Contracting is very legalistic, so it helps to have a lawyer or a trusted advisor read the fine print, so you know what you're in for. 

I think my role as proposal writer is unnecessary for smaller contracts. I've seen local contracts being 2-3 pages, as compared to federal, which can be in the hundreds (including Exhibits). Sales and executive teams can handle the job."
BravoTopChef,folw5my,t3_g83ya3,1587871922.0,"The vibe is much friendlier and relaxed among the chefs. They have a good sense of humor for the most part. I liked it a lot and many of these chefs are Top Chef judges. So, it's fun to see them on both sides of a competition."
MakingTheCut,foi54gt,t1_foi4ums,1587778903.0,"ITA, I hope Sander rises high. I'd love to see Christian mentor Sander. They seem like two peas in a pod."
MakingTheCut,foi4lzo,t1_foi431e,1587778599.0,I'm glad I could help!
MakingTheCut,foi4k8r,t3_g7jwtc,1587778571.0,"I think Sander deserved a runner-up prize of seed money. He had so much creativity and was willing to play. Without him, the show would have been dreadfully boring. 

I think Sander will have a storied career ahead of him. But I don't think he was Amazon's cup of tea due to his exuberance and artfulness. And I think it's a good thing he didn't get sucked into that juggernaut."
MakingTheCut,foi3vzq,t3_g7kfu5,1587778186.0,"That's an interesting question. Amazon has top-notch accountants who will invest in the fashion company to minimize taxes. As I've heard, Amazon manages to not pay taxes. I really don't think they are going to drop $1M in a bank account. 

I know for my pathetically small LLC, I can count as a tax deduction for expenses such as labor and equipment. I still pay taxes (about 40%), but on a smaller net balance. And if I can whittle down my net income really low, I barely pay taxes at all.

C-corps and S-corps are more complicated, so I don't know how taxes are assessed with them. 

I'm not an accountant, so I may be full of shit."
greysanatomy,fohn5oq,t3_g7hwpq,1587768796.0,I love Loretta Devine and thought she deserved a better role.
running,fohkm97,t3_g78kgh,1587767527.0,"That's great you ran so far. It shows your legs and lungs could handle the pace. That's the magic of endurance running and it feels great. 

But slow your roll... You are poised for an injury if you increase your distance too fast. The rule of thumb is not to increase your weekly mileage by 10%. Getting hurt is the worst part of running. Have fun, safely."
chopped,fohitzh,t3_g77eu1,1587766689.0,"I play a game where if a woman goes home first, I call ""girl chop."" There is a high proportion of women chopped 1st. I don't think the judges are biased, but probably the experience level of some women is lower due to kitchens still being male dominated. 

OTOH, women winners do well in championship tournaments."

Not counted, but I loved the Gregory/Stephanie confessional where she tried on his vest. It was adorable."
running,foe7fis,t3_g6x35z,1587697551.0,"I'm a snotty runner. My nose runs constantly and I'm sniffing and blowing. It's annoying, especially when I am wearing a face mask. I think it's a reaction to cool weather."

BravoTopChef,foculen,t3_g6ibru,1587676097.0,"I think Melissa is getting a winner's edit too soon. The producers wouldn't give away the winner. They want us hooked on the drama.

I'm rooting for Gregory because he's somebody I want as a friend and he'd cook for me, right? But I think he's a bit of underdog compared to Bryan and Kevin."
LifeProTips,fobjwjo,t3_g6k945,1587660570.0,"My sister and I learned this tip 40 years ago on Sesame Street. There was a segment in dividing a piece of chocolate cake, as I recall."
Coronavirus,foba02z,t1_fo98ngo,1587657664.0,"Thank you for your kind words. She has a good doctor and has improved. We also have a pulmonologist in the family, so that's a help. She mostly has a normal life, although I'm not sure how she'll fare in the long run."
Coronavirus,fo95jxx,t1_fo8xg5i,1587611040.0,"I think younger people fare better. My sister got diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis in her early 30s, which is a young age to have it. It's been 6 years and she's okay...except she lives in NYC, so Covid-19 is a real threat to her."
SiliconValleyHBO,fo83nba,t3_g64qbt,1587589323.0,I noticed that too and thought no programmer would use a Macbook Air. Maybe there's an inside joke in there.
Anxiety,fo7nvbc,t3_g5zaev,1587581531.0,"The main benefit of weed was an excuse to sit inside all day watching TV and eating junk food. I would feel calm until I'd wake up at 3am almost every night with a panic attack. 

I quit after my life spiraled into the abyss. I was living with my Mom, so I didn't have access. I've had many battles with depression and anxiety since then. But I associate weed with panic attacks, so I don't miss it."
