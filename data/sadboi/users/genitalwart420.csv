Amd,fnyk56o,t1_fnyjzwd,1587365600.0,I said imo for a reason. And plus it's really not much more tbh.
Amd,fnyj7te,t3_g4no5g,1587364773.0,There's some sites that calculate that for you. Imo you should jsut get the 700w because it'll be more future proof.

gaming,fnx2wr0,t1_fnx2tbh,1587330417.0,I think there will be bottlenecks on the cpu but yes I guess far too much ram is what threw me off
gaming,fnx0whf,t1_fnx0sz6,1587329306.0,I'm not trying to be a dick but it just caught me off guard in a sense I guess and it seems odd to me.
gaming,fnx0sz6,t1_fnx0fb8,1587329252.0,I didn't say that but 32 GB of ram just doesn't make sense with that set up. You're just looking at bottlenecks and won't be able to utilize that ram in the first place. Just doesn't make sense is all.
gaming,fnx08b8,t1_fnx0422,1587328930.0,No but 32gb ram with an i5 is pretty weird
gaming,fnwvg9t,t1_fnwp3t2,1587326234.0,I don't know about that either lol. 32gb ram and a 1660 with an i5 just doesn't make sense. The 32 GB ram doesn't even make sense eitherway.

pcgaming,fnwl0bj,t3_g4cewa,1587320402.0,"I'm not sure there's an age to be ""ready"" for a pc. That honestly just comes down to how you will be able to pay for it because it is expensive and generally more expensive than a console. You can go from 600$ mid tier to multiple thousands of dollars for a really good pc so price wise that comes down to what you can or want to pay and what you need it for. If you need a place to see builds at different price points I recommend logicalincrements.com. That will point you in the right direction but the main thing is if there is a game you plan on playing on pc then I'd consider the recommended specs of that game and get something a little more capable or if you can do your research find a future proof build. Good luck man!"

unpopularopinion,fnoqiz2,t1_fnoq423,1587131560.0,I agree that some take advantage of that label of being depressed or having mental health issues but that also shouldn't reflect on those who have things going on. Ive laid in bed for weeks and been in mental hospitals and from my experience. I didn't feel like I had a choice to get up at that point I couldn't see anyone or simply did not have the motivation to socialize or even attempt to escape my slump.

pcmasterrace,fj6uppr,t1_fj6uhw0,1583080575.0,Oh right on. I saw a couple videos about the stock AMD coolers being pretty damn good. I guess ill just use the cooler that comes with my cpu until i find the extra cash for a closed loop cooler. Thanks for responding!
pcmasterrace,fj6tvxr,t1_fj6q1mi,1583080067.0,Honestly I dont think OP should buy it either but if I am being honest the price isn't as insane as most that are on the market. considering the cpu and the gpu worth is around 550$ alone
pcmasterrace,fj6tgln,t1_fj6t7b2,1583079798.0,Oh alright. Makes sense! thanks for the response and if you dont mind. what cooler did you end up with? is it the stock cooler that comes with the cpu or a specific one and if so why?
pcmasterrace,fj6t13p,t1_fj6s5a9,1583079539.0,Do you think its worth it to get the ryzen 9 3900x over the 7 3700x considering the price and performance? I have heard that some of the higher end amd cpu's are overkill and are not very good for gaming.
pcmasterrace,fj6snpc,t1_fj6qnpf,1583079304.0,Glhf and if you need help check out some YouTube videos and there are plenty of websites that have pretty good builds on them at different price points. Just do your research and you'll do fine. Best of luck!

pcmasterrace,fj6r4g4,t3_fbvpwh,1583078356.0,Hey OP if you want to give building your own pc a chance or at least the idea of it. Check out logicalincrements.com they have a bunch of builds at different price points that are updated pretty often to get us the best deals on our builds.
pcmasterrace,fj6qx34,t1_fj6qj53,1583078228.0,Where did you hear that from lol I've never heard of that brand tbh. Man any sort of RMA sucks. Especially if you buy your componants in a weird order....
pcmasterrace,fj6py6a,t3_fbvpwh,1583077613.0,Bro just build one yourself and you'll save a couple hundred. I don't think that is a total ripoff for 700$ but still you could do much better with that budget. If you haven't built one before it may be a bit scary but it's honestly not that hard and you'll appreciate it more in the long run.
gaming,fimgbnp,t1_fimg694,1582529141.0,It's just a website that shows you what's best at different price points. You can buy the hardware from anywhere but it's nice to see a general price guide for builds.
gaming,fimg3cr,t1_fimfygz,1582528873.0,1k for an i3 that'll probably just bottle neck your 1650. All around I would just check out logical increments. It's a website that's updated pretty often with builds at different price points. With a little more research you could get something far better for that thousand dollars.

pcmasterrace,fig3r5n,t3_f7wd02,1582395815.0,Look up your beep codes. I think the mobo manual should have it or just look up that series of beeps. Sometimes if things are not seated properly then there are a set of sound indicators that'll help you. Check mobo manual first and see if you can find anything or just look up the beep sequence and you should be able to figure it out. Good luck!
pcmasterrace,fia9dqo,t3_f7bxi3,1582296183.0,Make sure it's booting from the correct drive if you can get to your bios. Also depending on if things are seated correctly or not there could be sound (beep) indicators that'll help you figure out what's going on.

IsItBullshit,fdd6zal,t1_fdd6wch,1578297569.0,That is if you're water fasting but also I'm not sure the exact reason if having to do with electrolytes or whatever you're actually dehydrated eitherway. Generally you're just pissing the life out of you when fasting (out your ass too)
IsItBullshit,fdd4ygu,t3_ekqh8h,1578294998.0,I think due to the dehydration the skin tightens up temporarily. I've fasted 7 days and although not for weight loss reasons did notice feeling quite toned but once you rehydrate and refeed I think it'll still come down to there being loose skin. It's best to just put on muscle to fill those areas. IMO

As for the lip, im sure another person commented knowing or experiencing what its like."
depression,fbj0vxn,t3_ed99oq,1576921670.0,well depending on what you told the doctor they will give advice but I dont think the doctor just asked that without there being red flags either through what you told him or her or your previous medical history. with that being said they are here to save lives and that doctor hit the nail on the head for you and thats great honestly. I also dont thing people dont see the signs rather than dont know how to deal with them or rather dont want to. sad but true (in my mind at least) find a point of reference and see where you are in a month after trying your best and im sure things will feel better. I did and i feel much better although when i drink too much i get in a dark place and want nothing but death and to raise hell. Learn to gain control and run with it
depression,fbj0inw,t3_edhkcl,1576921315.0,everyone tries to be something or a point of reference in a group and thats just how things are. we are wired to be around others and work together with them but i dont think that since we are depressed we work harder but rather we focus on other aspects of life and whatever the tasks at hand are.
depression,fbj07zh,t3_edhcd2,1576921046.0,"I always feel this way and I think it comes with people who are just sad even for a small amount of time where you thing that everything would be the same with or without you but thats just a symptom of feeling alone where you micromanage every aspect of all interactions and over read into things. the thing is with my own experience is that i will feel as if no one cares what i think or feel and that i contribute less in groups but in reality if i can get out of my head for a moment (which takes me getting drunk sadly) I see that its usually not like that and i am just in my head at that moment. sure there are times though where people try and over shadow you or theyre closer than you are to anyone of this certain group but you just need to try and push yourself to feel present. Sadly most of us that deal with this wont ever know unless you ask (considering the anxiety plays a part in your depression usually) most feel less than and think they contribute less.... sorry if im rambling or things are out of order, im drunk and this is the only time i feel comfortable enough to speak up.

All I can do is push forward still and do what I enjoy but I know deep down I'll feel alone at the end of the week and I'll be hindered by suicidal thoughts.
