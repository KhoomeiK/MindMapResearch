exmuslim,fqh1lc1,t1_fqh0nl7,1589364672.0,"The two effects are opposite yes. There's a significant but not complete overlap between the theorised psychological mechanisms. In social psychology classes it is taught that in threat-absent situations, the ISE holds; but in situations of threat, the BSE occurs. Though this is not exactly correct because in actuality the ISE may just be attenuated instead of reversed into the BSE. 

The cooperation explanation likely explains how religion got culturally selected in the past. I think the transmission today is more likely just due to factors like exposure to credible displays (aka CREDs) of religiosity from parents, which remains the strongest predictor of a person's religious belief."
exmuslim,fqgoyqc,t1_fqetu6m,1589352480.0,"Principal investigator for a few research studies but not an academic. To clarify, the black sheep effect is not as commonly studied/referenced as the intergroup sensitivity effect. Not sure why haha. For the latter, studies have focused on factors that attenuate (i.e. ingroup critics get treated as poorly as outgroup critics) or reverse it (outgroup > ingroup, which is more or less the BSE). See e.g. [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.628](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.628) (Indonesia), [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2012) (Singapore). A common factor that influences the effect is threat to the ingroup. My recent study basically extended that by showing that the temporal proximity of the threat can generate opposite reactions to ingroup vs. outgroup deviants, though I feel i'm only scratching the surface and there's a lot more nuance to uncover. 

If I remember correctly, there's at least one BSE study which found that long-time ingroup members elicit the strongest negative response for their deviance, while newcomers who conform to group norms are elevated the most. Maybe that's why Muslims put new converts on a pedestal and fawn over them, especially those who are maximally atypical. 

I think the evolutionary explanation of religion is pretty convincing! But then again evolutionary psychology is always criticised for conjuring just-so stories that make sense after the fact. Religion evolved as a way to uphold large-scale group cooperation (kin selection and reciprocity maxes out at \~150 pax). Cross-cultural studies do show that large societies throughout history feature costly religious rituals and widespread belief in high gods that punish/reward people for their deeds. Smaller societies, if they are religious, typically believe in deities that are not morally interested. Secular mechanisms (e.g. police, courts, contract law) also achieve the same effect though, which bodes well for a future without religion :)"
depression,fqg6656,t3_gibavz,1589338819.0,"I entered university with extremely low expectations. Since it's a top university I thought everyone would be better than me and I'd just score low Bs and Cs, pass the degree at best. Looking back now, nobody would guess I have depression from my stellar results. But I know I achieved this with a lot more blood, sweat and tears than the average person. Though intellect does help, I feel a depressed person will always have to put in more work to compensate for the effects of their depression. 

I slept very little during university (2 - 4h mostly) and this was a vicious cycle because I would end up feeling sleepy and spend even more time than I normally would on work. My 'normal' well-rested level of productivity was already low because I get distracted or overwhelmed easily and once I start crying that would be the end of the day's productivity. 

Depression made me a workaholic (an unproductive one) but not because of any positive motivations. Good results felt like the only thing I had left to my name, and this was detrimental because I catastrophised every assignment and exam. Hard work is also a form of self-harm. My life and health are so worthless to me that I was cool with damaging my brain/body with chronic sleep deprivation. My therapist would point out my good results and I'd lament: ""I've won... but at what cost?"". Every bone in my body aches and I feel like I'm close to having a heart attack. Despite having 20 waking hours a day, I only just manage to meet my deadlines. In the same amount of daily hours my friends achieve stellar results, participate in extracurricular activities, hold internships/part-time jobs, and have a social life."

Anyway I think you're on to something here! Many Muslims view themselves (or at least their beliefs) as superior to other religions/people, yet they also feel they're facing a grave threat to their survival and group distinctiveness—perfect recipe for engendering group conformity and extremely intolerance toward those who don't. Considering that the effect can be replicated even with completely arbitrary groups (e.g. by telling participants that they've been grouped based on the colour of the sticker they've been randomly given), one would expect the hostility toward black sheeps to be more intense for an entrenched religious identity."
