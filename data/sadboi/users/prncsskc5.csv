He interacts with each of us appropriate for their age and is a great babysitter for us when we have a scared little out. He is almost 6 foot and a big guy so I think we feel safe when hubby can't help...my 18 yr old and 21 yr old are also great with me but the 21 yr old isn't living with us anymore 🙃 and the 18 yr old is moving soon... it's killing my littles because of how much they treated us to things and was so loving.

kittens,fgm3w0c,t1_fgm2b81,1580917534.0,"Think of it the same way you do a puppy... Kittens need food, water, entertainment, comfort and love. Pick a food with no added grains. Make sure to feed them a small amount of wet food to avoid hairballs; kittens only need a spoonful at a time. The broths food is a good way to give them wet food and safer to feed whole package even to a kitten. Get a gravity water feeder to make sure they always have fresh water. Get a cat tree, a kitteh lounging box or bed and some toys. Cats don't like sleeping on the floor so if you don't get a cat tree...make room on furniture for them to make their spaces. Love is easy... Treat them like you would your dog...the old idea cats are loners isn't really the case for most cats and in the beginning as kittens they can be essentially taught to love being in laps and being pet because love for them is a trust thing.

raisedbynarcissists,fg6zffa,t3_ex9o00,1580580427.0,You are not alone. I have experience with both and I didn't really understand why I would carefully write my name...stare at it and then scribble violently over it to get rid of it but I did this starting when I could write at 4. I had a speech impediment due to enlarged toncils and adnoids so I learned to write by 4 and spell because my dad would make fun of sentences if I spelled things wrong.  We have DID now due to abuse...not only our parents but entire family and extended set of family treated us poorly. And some RSA that started at 3.
