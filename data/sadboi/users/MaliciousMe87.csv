That being said, the quality of the drivers are what are important. After a quick Google, it looks like they're pretty good sound quality with muddy low frequencies.

For the price you can get some excellent sounding wired earbuds, but you'll lose out on the cool functionality of Pixel Buds. But I've not listened to or heard of great sound reviews about many wireless buds (except Airpods Pro, but why pay that much when any other android buds have 95% of that functionality?), so... just factor that into your decision process.

-Got help, less delusional, lots of hallucinations, still suicidal, still losing jobs
-Continued figuring out meds, less delusional, less hallucinations, still suicidal, had side effects from meds (gained weight)
-New meds, less delusions, less suicidal, sleepy all the time.
-New meds, feeling safe, sleep like 14-18 hours a day.

Obviously there's much more to this story, but I think all of us are somewhere in this pattern. 

The first goal should never be ""recovery"". The first goal is *survival*. Once she's safe, she can start trying to manage side effects. If she gets to the point of feeling better, then you can focus on figuring out a better life.
