I was genuinely shocked. I remember the next day at school me and my friends were just dumbfounded wondering what the hell just happened and what it would mean going forward after that night. 

That night changed everything. I‚Äôd love to have been a fly on the wall in the back before it happened and after. 

One of the most highly debatable things still to this day. Was it a work? Or was it legit. After all these years I still wonder. I don‚Äôt think we will ever truly know the full details about everything that happened leading up to that night. Still seems so unreal to me it even happened."
