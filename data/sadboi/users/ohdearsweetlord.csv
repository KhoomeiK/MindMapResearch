Nowadays people will be 'bad' and eat via takeout multiple times a week for months, and then years. Restaurant food isn't made to sustain your body, it's made to taste good, sell, and be memorable enough to customers that some will come back and be regulars.

Being unemployed for six weeks let me focus on making art, something that's equally meaningful to me, and that I wish I had more time for. Ideally, I'd work only three or four days a week and have the rest for leisure, but I can't afford that, and that's the situation for millions, billions of people. And it doesn't have to be. There is meaningful work to be done that needs to be funded because it isn't profitable, like art therapy and historical archiving, that people could be doing but aren't, *can't*, because our societies are needlessly built on monetary profit.

Teach them how to move on from failure; if they're succeeding at everything they do, find them something they're bad at and guide them through trying (though let them quit if it makes them truly miserable). They need to develop a flexible attitude about themselves (it is good for me to attempt tasks and improve my skills and failure doesn't permanently reflect on me as a person) instead of a fixed one (I am smart and all I need to do to be good at something is try it and if I don't succeed that thing is not for me), or they will feel that lying about their success yields better rewards than admitting to failure.
