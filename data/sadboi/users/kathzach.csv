depression,fbr8pfa,t1_evy91xm,1577040497.0,"I would talk to them about this. My brother told us about the guilt and his burden and we, having dealt with this for so long, gave him our blessing. On the condition that he tries very hard to get better first. Hes only 20 now and we encouraged him to try his best to recover from the depression.. 10 years. To do whatever he needs to, to get well. Travel, take risks- meet people. Get a job and then quit that job if it's not right. Experiences help. I know thats not possible on the bad days- but they're not all bad. Take advantage of those good days and open up to your family. Maybe theyll surprise you with support and true understanding. Psychadelics can help as well."
