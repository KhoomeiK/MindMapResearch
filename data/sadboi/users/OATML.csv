ChristianAdvice,fnop3yv,t3_g2rbhj,1587130700.0,"Honestly man, I feel really proud of you. For multiple reasons. Pornography is one of the most addicting things in this world and it distorts the brain so much. I am so happy to hear you‚Äôve been a year clean. I personally have never had an interest in it, but I am one of the few. So props to you my man, you fought hard and the Lord is very pleased with you, as am I. 

So first of all, we all have our things that we find attractive. No matter how strange they may be, unless it‚Äôs harmful to others, they are all completely valid. Do not feel ashamed at all about this. It‚Äôs something you have fought hard to get through and now you‚Äôre through it. The cool thing is that since you‚Äôre a year clean, you will be even more excited with this girl. So keep in mind how good this is that you were able to get off of it.

Secondly, I advise you don‚Äôt say anything about it to her until you guys are very serious. Saying that early on is both kinda pointless and also needlessly uncomfortable. I‚Äôd say just play it cool and make sure you do tell her that you like it a lot, but wait until you guys are further down the road. I honestly bet she‚Äôd be really excited that you‚Äôre into it, but you just have to make sure you say it right.

Third, your mother will love you no matter what. I really don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll be too upset that you‚Äôre dating someone that Does something that turns you on. I could see that she would be a little concerned, as are all mothers about their children, but I highly doubt she will get upset over this. It‚Äôs something you can‚Äôt really help and honestly, if she wants what is best for you and wants you to be happy, she will respect you for it. 

Fourth, I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt tell this girl about the pornography troubles until you are pretty darn far in. That‚Äôs something that is a skeleton in your closet and unless she specifically asks you about your ‚Äúdarkest secrets‚Äù, I‚Äôd say please hold off on telling her. Wait until you‚Äôre very confident in your relationship with her. Also, if she loves you for you, she will accept it and be even more proud that you got through it as you did. I mean man, to put it blatantly, you basically beat satan at his own game. So seriously you should be so proud of yourself.

Lastly, always remember forever, you are loved by your Heavenly Father. More than anything. You are worth so much to him so I really hope you never feel ashamed of who you are. Have courage and be kind. The Lord loves you so much. I know from my own life that there are a lot of things I‚Äôve done that I know have distanced my relationship with the Lord, but the fact of the matter is that I never turned my head away from Him. Always keep Him at the center of your life and I promise you that you will be blessed beyond anything you could imagine. 

Hey man, I‚Äôm proud of you. You are a good person from what I can tell. Lmk if there‚Äôs anything else you need. I‚Äôll keep you in my prayers."

Hold on to your standards and beliefs. Hold on to them. You have made an amazing decision to save yourself for marriage and you're only going to get more blessings and love for it. I promise you that! I am in the same boat as you because I also am remaining pure till marriage and let me tell you, I know it's the right choice and I have seen so many blessings because of it. Remember that Christ knows exactly what you're going through and He loves you so incredibly much. Your decision to not lose your virginity before marriage is for sure the right decision and you will be blessed! Remember, the devil wants you to be cast off from the presence of the Lord. He wants you to give in and let go of this promise you've made.

I definitely know what you're feeling and I've felt the pressure and I have been made fun of before about it too, but you know what? You are strong and you will be blessed because of this.

Keep your head up. The Lord Christ loves you :)
