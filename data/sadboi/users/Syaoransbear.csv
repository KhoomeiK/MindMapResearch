""From April 2014 to March 2017, 73% of victims of domestic homicides (homicides by an ex/partner or family member) were women. This contrasts with victims of non-domestic homicides, where the majority of victims were male (88%) and 12% of victims were female (ONS, 2018).

From April 2014 to March 2017 four in five female victims of domestic homicide were killed by a partner or ex-partner (239, 82%); of which the vast majority of suspects were male (238). 45 male victims were killed by a partner or ex-partner in the same time period; 7 of the suspects in these cases were male, and 38 were female (ONS, 2018).

One study of 96 cases of domestic abuse recorded by the police found that men are significantly more likely to be repeat perpetrators and significantly more likely than women to use physical violence, threats, and harassment. In a six year tracking period the majority of recorded male perpetrators (83%) had at least two incidents of recorded abuse, with many having a lot more than two and one man having 52 repeat incidents. Whereas in cases where women were recorded as the perpetrator the majority (62%) had only one incident of abuse recorded and the highest number of repeat incidents for any female perpetrator was eight. The study also found that men’s violence tended to create a context of fear and control; which was not the case when women were perpetrators. (Hester, 2013)

Over 80% (83%) of high frequency victims (more than 10 crimes) are women. (From a study of data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, a nationally representative household survey.) (Walby & Towers, 2018)

In the year ending March 2018 the large majority of defendants in domestic abuse-related prosecutions were men (92%), and the majority (66%) of victims were recorded as female (13% of victims were male and in 21% of prosecutions the sex of the victim was not recorded) (ONS, 2018)."""

And that isn't true.

Those delivery companies are making bank and they absolutely do not pay their drivers or programmers or customer service reps enough, but I think you underestimate how much money it costs just to run those apps and have thousands of programmers, customer reps, and drivers on call 24/7, 7 days a week.

Like when I showed a sweet pc setup to a male friend that a girl made and he replied with, ""I bet some guy built that for her"" and I asked what made him feel that she didn't build it herself and we explored his thoughts and feelings about it l.

I'm not really sure what you mean by 'bad'?"
AskPinkPillers,fpmr12f,t3_geb8op,1588739474.0,"When I began taking men seriously and stopped trying to convince myself they were just joking. 

I have had mostly male friends my whole life and work in a male dominated field. I am privy to A LOT of locker room talk. Customers have even shown me extremely brutal and degrading porn at work because they found it funny. 

I just can't convince myself men view women as people anymore. I have heard, seen, and experienced too much."
PinkpillFeminism,fpmgb9x,t1_fpmcz3m,1588732454.0,"It isn't just female horse people, because the craziest person I encountered was the stable owner who was male. This is the starting of the insanity:

I made the mistake of asking the trainer who lived on the property if her horses were on some diet or feeding schedule because they didn't have any food in their paddock. My horse was sharing the same paddock and I wanted to know because if she has her horses on strict diets, my horse shouldn't be in the same paddock as hers. I was treating my horse for thrush and I was paying extra to keep him in a paddock so I didn't have to find him out in the pasture to apply the antifungal.

She immediately called the stable owner completely livid and accusing him of starving her horses. They were having some sort of weird feud I didn't know about. Maybe twenty minutes after I sent my message he was out in his bobcat  putting hay in their paddock. After, he cornered me in a stall with my horse shaking with rage asking why I told the trainer he was starving our horses when they clearly had food in their paddock. Like dude, I never said that, also you JUST put that food there!

He was a big guy and was shaking his finger right in my face. I was the only one at the barn besides him. It was very frightening and I made the mistake of thinking it was a one off experience. This was the beginning of a series of many, many issues with the stable owner, the trainer, and then eventually the entire local horse community because of all the gossip. It completely ruined owning a horse for me. 

I don't know if it's something about the close bond you develop with a large, intelligent animal that can live about 30 years combined with the cost of the hobby, or maybe the younger age of the riders, but the people are super intense."

It was a horrible experience and I ended up selling my horse a few years later. It was a much better fit for him because he needed someone with more experience, but the day he left felt so freeing."

AskWomen,fphgbp4,t3_gddvka,1588620783.0,"I was disagreeing with a post that said women receive constant positive reinforcement and affirmation throughout their lives so they can't handle rejection as well as men. Not only is that so very false, but I also pointed out that if men handled rejection better there wouldn't be so many women being stalked, beaten, raped, murdered, or living in women's shelters because of domestic abuse from their spouse. Got downvoted a whole bunch. Really don't know why, it's the truth."
