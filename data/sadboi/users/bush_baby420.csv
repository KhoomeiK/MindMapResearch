Due to various trauma junk, my boyfriend backs off a lot when I'm not okay for touching. His method when I'm not feeling stable is usually to continue life as usual. Unless I make it clear I need to express myself or want affection, he'll do his best to just treat me like normal and not tip toe around my quiet mood.

Me and my boyfriend have been together for 3 years, and he's my world. We've been long distance the majority of the relationship, but we work together well. He's a genuinely good guy, but he has a lot of demons and issues he doesn't know how to handle. About a year ago he called me, really struggling to get his words out and told me that he had been soliciting prostitutes during his extreme depressive episodes. He just wept and told me it had been months since he'd done it, but he was trying to get better and work out his issues. He told me he had started going to a therapist and that telling me the truth was the only way he could live with himself and get better. He was sure he'd never hear from me again. 

I was crushed. I cried for days, I didn't eat, i couldn't stand the thought of him or myself. I didn't speak to him for weeks. After awhile, I agreed to talk to him on the phone. We cried together, I yelled a bit, he listened and answered some questions. And ultimately, we ended up staying together. 

The only reason I chose to stay was because I could see that even during those weeks he thought I was gone forever, he had stood by his word. He continued to work on his drinking, kept going to therapy, started going to the gym, went back to church, and was focused on trying to let me do what would help me find peace, even if it meant leaving him behind. 

I kept my space for awhile, let him continue working on himself, and we had to establish boundaries. I didn't want him being alone with women, he had to stop binge drinking, I can't use those events against him during arguments, and we needed to work on talking through fights rather than just forgetting them. 

I'll never understand what he did. I don't think he really will either. But I know that man would do absolutely anything to make me happy and that I want nothing but healing for him. We've grown a lot as people, and while I'm still working on trust and the pain of it, he never makes me feel bad for being hurt and does everything possible to relieve those worries.

AskReddit,etaxsxs,t3_canjua,1562631934.0,"My computer was having a lot of issues and pop ups and junk. It was fine, but I planned to go to a tech support place for it that week. 

Then, my computer opened up a webpage all on its own with the Microsoft logo saying that my network was infected and that I needed to call a number listed IMMEDIATELY or risk permanent damage. Tried to close the window and it would give me a notification box telling me that this was urgent and I would essentially be killing my computer.

Called the number, some south Asian dude convinced me my network was infected (it wasn't) and that I needed a $200 program installed. Funny enough, he also installed two really great ad blocks and my computer worked much smoother because of it. I filed a complaint, tried to get a refund, but my money was gone."

Finally, she comes out of her room Dripping blood down her arm and calmly says ""I need stitches"".

 She waited until we had opened the door and looked us both dead in the eye as she sliced her arm open. Screaming that she wants us to have to live with seeing her die. 
She lived. But holy shit. I'll never forget that.

relationship_advice,erz9pyj,t3_c4t1v1,1561429453.0,"When it comes down to it, you guys just need to talk about it. Tell her why the comments bother you. Sometimes people just say stupid shit without thinking. Especially when women are speaking to their friends.

Consider the relationship itself. She sounds like a hard working person considering you've mentioned a master's degree and full time job in other contents. It sounds like you've also had some bad experiences with others chasing money. Give her the opportunity to handle this like adults. Those comments are unsettling and kind of demeaning, but they are a few sentences in two years worth of happy and healthy memories. 

Just talk and express what you want this to look like moving forward and what those comments bring up for you emotionally. She's not a bad person, and you aren't being irrational, you just have to communicate."

One day they assigned me to watch four high-risk patients as a brand new employee. I wasnt even trained on what to do if a patient acted out, they just told me to yell if anything went wrong.

It's me, in a tiny kitchen with lots of yellow light making dinner. I'm just humming to myself and my ""special someone someday"" comes up behind me and holds me. We just sit there smiling and enjoying the moment. It feels safe.
I always cry and smile at the thought of feeling at home."
