threekings,fjyrljv,t1_fjxfs28,1583703085.0,Today I actually made a therapy appointment and planned a visit to see my Dad after thinking a LOT about what you both said. I have high hopes for things getting better!
threekings,fjwzhyj,t1_fjwzdis,1583650276.0,".... uh.... I don’t know how you want me to respond to this? 

I got a notification that I was mentioned in a comment, came here, and listened to the section of the video discussing my experience. And then commented. 

But go off, I guess?"
threekings,fjwuvy2,t3_ff7t1i,1583646470.0,"Huh. Strange to pop on here and see that my Three Kings experience was discussed. I listened - you both had some very insightful things to say, and I thank you for that. 

Unfortunately, things have been.... -happening- since I did Three Kings. I’m remembering more and more about my childhood that I never realized. I’ve had a few very odd phone calls from my Dad. 

Every time I dream it’s like I’m back there again. I’m not sure what to do."
threekings,fjgm8rw,t1_fjfn9f3,1583330444.0,"I was thinking about that. It would make sense. But even so, the atmosphere in the room made it feel like they were both *meant* to be there. It was so strange! If you're talking about *Ozymandias*, it was, if I'm remembering correctly, the Grecian version of Egypt's pharaoh Rameses II. Might be wrong though. I'll have to look it up. Since I did the ritual, I've been remembering more and more of the weird shit my Dad taught me when I was little."

threekings,fj4k8fq,t1_fj4jg17,1583010208.0,"Hi, thanks for commenting! Yes, it does say that. However, while on my medication, I am, for the most part, mentally okay. And while this is because of my medication, I still count it. If I was in a bad or dark place last night, I wouldn't have done it. Besides being exhausted, I mostly took my Vistaril as a precaution, and because being in the dark in general gives me anxiety. I hadn't considered that I could get a panic attack while doing this, and that was dumb on my part. (And yes, it was terrifying. I can't stop thinking about it)."

AmItheAsshole,fhe2ixd,t3_f2qowt,1581511724.0,"NTA at all. Trauma is the WORST and if you feel uncomfortable or upset around anyone, especially a family member, your parents should respect that. Period."
AmItheAsshole,fhe1t24,t3_f2pvtk,1581511065.0,"NTA. I went through the same thing with my parents when I was 15/16 (2011) and after my diagnosis. What ended up happening was I had to sit them down and ask them outright WHY they refused to let me get treatment for it other than my weekly therapy sessions. They were scared/concerned to put me on medication because pills were, unfortunately, how I tried to kill myself (that’s what lead to my diagnosis). Once I knew that, it made a lot more sense. I’m sure your parents think they’re doing what’s best for you. A family meeting or open conversation may be what’s needed to lay everything out on the table. Hope that helps."

AmItheAsshole,fhbxqwo,t3_f2e40h,1581452104.0,"YTA. I promise that your situation is not as weird or unusual as it sounds, and I mean that in the best way. I did the same thing as a kid, as did two of my cousins. My own mom was freaked when it was happening, but her Mom group said that some of their own kids did it. It’s pretty normal, especially if you had a family member die. Children have their own strange, unusual ways of dealing with not only death, but the concept of it. If he’s still doing it as a teenager, I would be concerned. But at 9? I wouldn’t worry about it. Maybe not play along with it, sure, but don’t worry either. 🤷🏼‍♀️"
