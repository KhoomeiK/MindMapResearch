Also, on things that we ""like"" about the church: I, like you, liked the idea of eternal families, and I liked the idea of a loving all-powerful father, etc. But here's the thing: liking something and wanting it to be real when there is no replicable evidence to support its veracity is a bad reason to follow a paradigm that dictates how you make life choices. It would be nice if we get to be with the ones we love after we die, but it's just as likely that we're reborn as animals or that our souls go on to become stars.

exmormon,fm6x7qp,t1_fm6nena,1585805947.0,"To add to the previous response, basically (for men at least) they are boxer briefs very much like a low-quality pair of cotton Hanes boxer briefs, except that they only come in white, and they are about 6 inches longer (usually hitting at about the knee), accompanied by a white, poorly tailored t-shirt. Women's garments are actually almost the exact same thing. there are variations (cotton polyester, nylon mesh, etc) but they are all horribly uncomfortable when compared to a decent pair of underwear."
exmormon,fm6wo7u,t3_ftb6hz,1585805466.0,"Dudes, yes wear real underwear but here's a tip:  
get *GOOD* underwear! I'm talking the Calvin Klein stuff that is sold as an individual pair and is on its own hanger, the kind that's stretchy af but also breathes, the kind that has clean, smooth seems and is designed to support. You can get a really nice pair for like $5-$15 at TJ Maxx or marshalls or Ross or one of those type of places and they are light years better than standard cotton fruit of the loom."

AskReddit,fly55h0,t3_fruade,1585595723.0,"I have Ergophobia, a phobia of jobs. People assume that means I don't like to work, but that's not it at all. I get crippling anxiety from even the idea of bosses, shifts, meetings, small talk with Coworkers, scheduled breaks, uniforms... all of it. My last job ended with me running out of a meeting to the parking lot because i felt like there was no oxygen in the air.

I actually quite enjoy losing myself in a meaningful task, helping people, or doing volunteer work, but something about the structure and routine of a ""job"" is literally more than I can handle.

It's a real problem but only mental health professionals have ever validated it (apparently it's related to ptsd), everyone else says I'm lazy.

Edit: added detail."
