And yes, this virus is ruining small businesses and that is truly detrimental, and yet instead of protesting the quarantine itself, which is saving lives, how about using all that sudden free time to rally online and write senators, call your representatives, and get some proper distribution of that bailout money?

Also, don't you only get fined for leaving the house for non-emergency reasons? Going to buy groceries and whatnot is essential, so you shouldn't ge getting dinged for that.
