AskReddit,fqtymtb,t1_fqpucsp,1589648623.0,"Thank you for your thoughts. 

I do have self worth and self value but I also watched someone try to kill themselves, save their life, then spent the last 3 years working really hard on myself and healing my childhood trauma and saw 2 different therapists. The first to make sure I didn't develop PTSD, the second to round off my skills now that I had gone out and learned a fuck ton about being a healthy human. I guess what I'm curious about is the basic question of ""what holds people back from therapy"". What I've learned from this thread is that there's a lot more than just cost and a bad experience. So thanks again for your thoughts as well. It's be interesting to hear other journeys."

CasualConversation,fqtxpaj,t1_fqpw1uk,1589648118.0,"Hi there.
It seems to be somewhat province dependent. In Toronto specifically there are lots of free services for people under 25. CAMH and other mental related hospitals have emergency walk in services. You can opt to have a student therapist for a reduced rate. (This generally applies to specific institutes that teach a type of psychotherapy, like Gestalt). There are programs that run for things like abuse, addictions, domestic violence, that are free. 
I think the short answer is it's not just for severe disorders. And sometimes for severe disorders you're paying $200 a session for a specialist (therapist trained heavily in dealing with bi-polar disorder, or paranoid delusional disorder, etc). Some insurance policies do cover services with social workers. Social workers can be a GREAT option for lower cost or government funded programs or what have you."

(I live in Canada, can I ask where you're located?) You have to do quite a bit of work here to get licensed to practice. What you've described almost sounds like a life coach... That, uh, discipline, states they don't focus on the past, but focus instead on the future. Most social work training is about healing the effects of childhood trauma, as well as the trauma itself. 

What you've described sounds horribly frustration, unjust, and like a terribly broken, unmonitored system with low standards."

CasualConversation,fqptod2,t1_fqpp71b,1589553779.0,"Thanks for sharing. I actually agree with a solid portion of what you're saying. Real problems are minimized when everyone self diagnoses. There are some issues that NEED expert intervention by individuals who are properly trained. And anxiety is self diagnosed like there's no tomorrow, even when it's just a normal feeling we all feel sometimes. Anxiety disorders are very different, and shouldn't be minimized, or disregarded.

Also, WAY too many meds are prescribed. The human mind is astonishingly resilient. 

The catch is if you have the skills you do well, if you don't, you don't. So this is where I disagree. 

Statistically, around 50% of children grow up experiencing some kind of abuse (physical, emotional, verbal, sexual, spiritual) or emotional neglect. Which results in not learning certain skills needed to function as an adult. Relationship skills, communication, boundaries, self worth etc. 

This is where I think therapy can be super valuable, because it's all stuff you can learn as an adult, but it can be very difficult to do alone. However, that means therapist actually need to focus on helping someone learn those skills and be a support system and not just chalk it up to anxiety or depression or what have you. All real things, but there is often other stuff underneath that. 

Thanks so much for this comment. This is really interesting."

mentalhealth,fprxpbf,t3_gewdnm,1588864001.0,"Hi there,

Thank you for sharing and being vulnerable with us. 

I'm going to start by saying that I won't be able to fully understand you. I have never struggled with BPD and I don't know anyone who has struggled with it. I have stopped a suicide attempt in someone who has bipolar disorder so I have some understanding in this area having witnessed this trauma. 

You are right, you do need a therapist who understands BPD. Help looks a lot different when you get help that targeted for what you need. And you deserve to get that help.

The right kind of help matters, and I really hope you find it.

The sad reality is, because we're still catching up with the reality of how mental health exists in our world a lot of people not only don't understand, they can't mentally cope themselves and so come out with unhelpful phrases like ""just get over it"" etc. That's a pretty useless thing to say, especially because it doesn't work like that. Chances are the people in your phone haven't experienced darkness and don't have the skills or capacity to carry it for you. 

Do you think it might help if you could find someone who has BPD and is having success with understanding and living with it? There are legitimate therapists on reddit, they appear out of the blue at times. But maybe they know about what kind of therapist or training is needed to get proper help? 

The internet is a big place and can be a great tool, if we choose to use it that way. 

Where are you located (country)? I have a lot of experience in being in therapy and finding resources and stuff. Maybe I'll be able to find something more targeted."
AskReddit,fprwf4b,t1_fpr4z9y,1588863333.0,"I'm a second generation Canadian who still has family in Slovakia. My Nana's (starymama) opinion is that the country would have been better off economically if it remained Czechoslovakia. That other countries don't necessarily bother so much with the smaller countries, like Slovakia when it comes to trade and stuff like that. Now I have only visited once and absolutely loved both Slovakia and the Czech Republic. It just seemed like there is better tourism money coming from foreigners who visit Prague, whereas Bratislava had less tourism, but Northern Slovakia has a lot of tourism from neighbouring countries for skiing and hot springs. Can you speak to this at all? I'm curious."
getdisciplined,fprvqqn,t3_geyai7,1588862963.0,"Hi there,

I've noticed since joining reddit that this seems to be a common thing. So know you're not alone!

You have moved forward, at least that's my opinion from reading this. Now you have space to move into the next phase. It sounds like you need to discover what you really value and want to spend your time on. Part of that may include building a solid friend group who you connect with.

Quarantine definitely isn't helping with that. I miss hugs so much. I haven't worked for 2 months. And like everyone else. I have great days and not so great days. That's normal, especially because we are going through a collective trauma. I'm learning a lot about myself at this time, and it sounds like you're doing self discovery too. 

You've got the time. Learn about yourself! But also let yourself have your lonely moments. Feeling through those things helps you learn how to make the change you want. :)"

Unfortunately many many people ascribe to the mentality of 'nothing but hard work and productivity' but that's not realistic for even the most put together people. They struggle to acknowledge mental health because for a lot of people, that's still a new concept. 

I'm sorry you had to hear something like that. Understand though that often what comes out of people's mouths is not about you, it's a reflection of themselves and what they can and can't do or cope with. 

I'm sorry that this is coming from your parents. You deserve to be supported even if they don't understand it.
