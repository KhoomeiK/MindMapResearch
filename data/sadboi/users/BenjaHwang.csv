summonerschool,fr0ssc3,t3_glo4g7,1589805832.0,"Wave management is something everyone overcomplicates. Core concept of freezing is that you need at least 4 healthy casters to set up a freeze. You tank the 4 minions until your wave arrives. Your freeze is broken when minions take too much damage, so you ideally want to freeze a bit farther up in lane as opposed to right in front of your tower so that minions don't randomly walk into turret range and take damage.

There are 2 ways of getting the wave to push into you. One obvious way is hitting your minions less than your opponent does. Another way is to crash your wave in into your opponent's tower. If you successfully shove your wave into tower, the enemy minions will arrive first and start aa'ing first, and it will naturally push into you. If you're a weak early game champ you can't shove your wave in as your opponent could just freeze it in front of the tower."
