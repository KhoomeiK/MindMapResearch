I just didn't know how to respond since I exactly knew why someone would try it (I've never attempted suicude, but I've had thought about it basically since teenage years) so I just shrugged it off. I wouldn't want them to know I've been struggeling with these thoughts my whole adult life. The concept that people don't get why people kill themselves however is just alien to me."
