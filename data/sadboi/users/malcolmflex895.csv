But this region and series will always have a place in my heart, and truly brought back a feeling I've been missing from Pokemon. Or maybe just in general. Thank you TPC. It's been a hell of a 20 years. Looking forward to the new series. It looks like they'll be changing things up again and this time I'm ready. It might be time to retire Hiker David soon...

Thank you for Team Rocket specifically in this series, lol they were amazing. I can't wait to see the Bewear family again soon. Mimikyu scenes in this episode might've gotten a tear or two out of me I won't lie."

marvelstudios,f4uxlhm,t3_dlgkql,1571832557.0,"The snap. The final moments before and after (Including Hawkeye & Ant-Man scenes) are so surreal and dreadful, it was something we were expecting but also weren't at the same time, and it delivered so hard. As legendary as the comic is, the film interpretation is far superior. Honestly you could go as far as to say, the entire time leading up to 2018 Thanos' death counts as well. I can still remember the hollow sensation I felt after the IW ending theme played as Thor walked out Thanos' hut. I thought the actual snap was rock bottom, but that utter useless act of ""heroism"" really cemented the failure of The Avengers. All of those scenes capture an incredibly powerful moment in the lives of all of these characters and marked a shift in the MCU both in universe and out.
