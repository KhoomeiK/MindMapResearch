I'm also working on getting my life back on track which is what attracted me to your post here. I'm 26, survived a severe car accident and my dad died just a few months later. I'm almost done going through bankruptcy (no income post-accident = debt), almost have the legal things settled, and am scheduled to go into a treatment facility soon to regain my capacity to live my life after the trauma and the grief.

Not intending to make this conversation about me, just sharing that obstacles can occur at any time and it's never too late to put your life back on the path you want to follow. :)

There are only two people in my personal life who know what I'm struggling with apart from my doctors. My best friend, who does not know about it, sometimes makes posts or statements regarding these ""crackheads"" in our town. It hurts like hell to read. But I don't want to tell her about what I'm going through. It's very, very personal for me.

I get it, in the sense that there are some loud and obnoxious people around who fall into the addict category. But I am and always have been a strong believer that being a dick and being an addict DO NOT just simply go hand in hand. Some people are jerks who just so happen to also have an addiction.

DeadBedrooms,exw9z35,t1_exv5bd6,1566616179.0,"TL;DR: Good comment, good post. You both get upvotes. Thank you, comment writer - you have helped me tonight.

Hey, I'm just lurking at the moment but I felt the need to reply to you specifically to thank you for a portion of what you wrote in your comment. I won't go into detail, but I am someone who is on the long road of working toward recovery and management of some mental health issues. One of those being C-PTSD. 

I wanted to thank you because a portion of what you wrote triggered a flood of memories of some unpleasant experiences from my past. That may sound strange that I'm thanking you for this, but I am because by remembering them, I'm now able to target and work through them to continue my recovery. 

Obviously it was definitely very scary to have them come back, but I had the space in mind to immediately grab my therapy workbooks and start trying to deal with the effect it was having on me emotionally. Just, thank you for inadvertently helping me continue my journey.

What you say is very true: for OP to first ask themselves honestly and truthfully if they really are committed to this for the long haul; if they are capable of being there for the very difficult and very long road that it is. There is no shame in being honest that a certain amount of stress or a certain situation is not something you are ready to put yourself through. I'm saying this as someone who deals personally with these things and has had partners leave me because it was not something they were able to stick through with me. 

As this person, I'm telling you OP: even I see no fault in those who have been honest with me and left me for that reason. I respect those who told me before getting in too deep, and I appreciate that they made that difficult decision to leave for that honest reason rather than stay and build resentment towards me in the long run."

And yes, I do actually have some very good resources in my local area for support with this.
