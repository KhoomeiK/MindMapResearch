I can imagine it’s hard to see/hear people dote on him how cute it is whereas you have been trampled on by those people for being raised in your culture. He’s basically disrespecting your heritage by not acknowledging the pain people from your culture have gone through. 

I’d suggest to have a real heart-to-heart as soon as possible and talk to him about how those people doting over him now treated you while growing up. How he might not see it as ‘trashy’ but French speakers have always looked down on your culture, and that still hurts."

I know most people rent a van right before they move in and in one day pick up all their furniture secondhand from people or drive to a nearby ikea. It’s not very ideal but if you’d do that I’d suggest also taking a look at Kringloop Zuid and Kringloop de Loods, basically two massive secondhand stores that sometimes even have complete kitchens."
maastricht,fjg7fkt,t3_fd3b9n,1583315124.0,"Only tip I can give you is don’t be afraid to live across the border in Belgium (it’s only a 15min cycle) and when you do message people about a room make sure it’s original, stands-out, and contains everything you want to know/say in 1 message.  When I was looking for a roommate I’d get over 60 messages in one hour alone and didn’t have time to keep up a conversation, plus any generic messages about people being a good cook, sociable, quiet etc I’d automatically not trust since it says nothing about who you are. 

Best strategy is to visit Maastricht for a week and respond to any room that you can come take a look and meet each other in person right away. Be aware some houses might have a ‘hospiteeravond’ where they invite you and say 9 others for a 30min tour of the house (and that times 3) and play maybe a game or ask weird questions (though I’m not sure Maastricht is this bad) to see who’s the best match. 

Most (Dutch) students will go home when the year finishes so May/June/July would be the highest turnover of rooms (since no one wants to pay for a summer that they’re not in their room..). If you come in August you’ll definitely have a hard time finding something. In the Netherlands you only have to give a month’s notice so you’d have to be quick and willing to maybe pay an extra month. Depending on the size of the house / your room, rent should be €330-450, though it’s cheaper in Belgium. If you’re unsure if you’re being overcharged you can always send me a message :)

Oh and I don’t know from where you’re traveling but I’d advice you to bring furniture with you. Mostly all rooms come unfurnished, unless you can take stuff over from the previous person, and scraping secondhand bits together while everyone’s moving/selling is really exhausting and tbh not worth it.

I hope you enjoy your time in Maastricht! I assume your application is now completely finalised? Congrats!"

bipolar,fgt97eq,t3_f0ccwr,1581101162.0,"You could look up the characteristics of a (hypo)manic or depressed episode, but I think the best way is to simply ask her. Have a talk on how she feels about ‘having the official label’ and how she’s doing with the medication. Most are pretty heavy and the side-effects in the first few weeks are no joke - I had tremors in my arm, rapid heartbeat and a general feeling of having taken drugs. It scared me more than the actual diagnosis. 

Ask her to put into words for you how she behaves and feels during these episodes, and also how she calms herself down or lifts herself up. Maybe check what she wants you to do when something is indeed out of the ordinary, so that you also don’t feel like you’re parenting her. You can guide her towards balance but you cannot force her to if she doesn’t want to in that moment, even-though it is better for her. She’ll likely set up a crisis plan with her GP / psychiatrist with steps on what to do if she is not in control, I don’t know how old you guys are but it’s helpful to have the phone number of someone really close to her (family or partner) who can help you out. 

Also, the first months after diagnosis were very intense for me. I thought I had accepted it but clearly I hadn’t, leading to me freaking out at random intervals and tbh going through all the stages (denial, anger, loss, acceptance etc). It might be wise to steer away from alcohol for the time being, especially with recent medication. The thing I really missed was, since she likely will set up a healthy routine for sleep and exercise, to have someone I could jog a few times a week with. Or meet up for early dinner instead of cocktails so you can head to bed on the scheduled time without missing out. 

It is really lovely to hear that she feels secure enough in you to share this and to trust you to take care of her. Warms my heart that you even posted this message and I’m more than sure she’ll appreciate every single bit you do!"

It will help you find a pattern of things that calm you or that set you off- being in tune with your emotions and negotiating with yourself how you want to respond to that is vital to regaining some balance. It is hard work and I promise you most of us are not there yet either but the people around you certainly notice the difference and overtime you will too.

I’ve had lots of doubts when first diagnosed, especially when it comes to severity, but trust me - it doesn’t matter. Everybody responds in a different way, has different manifestations of episodes and different coping mechanisms. All that matters is that you find a way to provide some counter fuel to what you’re brain is telling you to do. My therapist always says, there’s nothing wrong with being a little hypomanic a week before a big deadline, or conveniently feeling a bit on the low when a dreaded event is coming up so you cannot go - there will come a time when you can control your episodes, minimise the downsides and actual benefit a bit from the extra energy.

Application is free, easy to do on your phone or laptop and takes about 15mins. You’ll only need to show how long you’ve been in the UK via gas/housing bills, have a valid passport, and a reason to stay - having a work contract comes in hand. I think before you can legally work you also need to get a National Insurance number. You can do the application online and it’ll cost around £50 if I remember correctly, however you can only apply once you’re in the UK (and with the address you’re staying at). 

Hope this helps, best of luck, and enjoy!

Edit: you can apply for the visa until dec-2020 or jun-2021, it’s only if you’re planning on staying after dec-2020 :)"
BipolarReddit,fendw10,t1_fend8fv,1579282589.0,Exactly. Maybe the active ingredients are off-brand way cheaper. Not sure how it works in the US but where I am they give me regular quetiapine tablets instead of actual Seroquel and I’ve never felt the difference so far.

maastricht,fekeklj,t3_epl4ds,1579198408.0,"As far as I know there is no fee, but you can always check with the Student Service Centre (SSC). They have a nifty chat option nowadays but you can always give them a ring and they’ll connect you to the right person to answer your question. If you’re not in the same timezone yet I can always contact them for you if you like?

[SSC Helpdesk](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/service-centres/student-services-centre) 

You’ll find what they cover on this page as well as their contact details and hours. Very useful also when you’re studying in Maastricht! If you need some nice places to relax or advice on housing let me know, I did my Masters there and grew up there as well"

Donating money to prevent cancer and hair loss all together is way more supportive. If you want something more personal, cooking a meal every now and then and knitting/crocheting gloves/hats/scarves to battle the cold will be very much appreciated by many!"
AskDID,fegfzyb,t1_fege748,1579091499.0,Many thanks for your openness GhostCloset! You’ve given me a lot to think about and to discuss with my therapist. Glad to hear you have found a way that works for you and happy that it is indeed possible to keep things in control.
AskDID,feg7rj6,t1_fef8f27,1579081050.0,"Oh that is really interesting!! Haven’t found that anywhere yet. Do you have a coping mechanism that is worth trying? Are you treating it, is it treatable and does it work for you?"

bipolar,fe3s6dx,t3_enphe8,1578852354.0,"The first few months of taking lithium I would somehow black out after even 1 or 2 glasses of slowly drank wine. Nowadays I drink like I normally would while on Lithium, I know some types of beer or alcohol would affect me in weird ways and I tend to change what type of alcohol I drink when I’m in a certain mental state. All in all it is definitely safe to drink and take lithium as long as you know what works for you. Always drink more water than you normally would because alcohol dehydrates and ups the lithium level in your blood!"

BipolarReddit,fbg4nv3,t3_ed5xk4,1576834212.0,"For me when this happens it usually points to a mixed episode or that I’m sliding towards a manic episode (> do you also feel a bit more jumpy or as if you’re between dreaming and reality during the day?). I haven’t found a solution yet besides taking a tiny bit of quetiapine (Seroquel) to dampen my mind during the night but be fit to function in the morning. I also noticed that lightflashes (such as a tv) and invasive music (no headphones) seem to worsen those dreams. I’d like to stick to ‘natural’ sensory input - soft (candle) light, a book, knitting, talking with friends, the occasional netflix episode if you leave it at 1. Hope this helps, it truly sucks!"

My GP however keeps telling me my thyroid is fine it just needs some extra push once in a while and is refusing to give me medicine. Does that sound familiar to you? Did taking thyroid medication reverse these? Really want to push for any medication that might help be get back to a normal life since I can’t quit lithium sadly."
