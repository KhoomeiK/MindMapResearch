A working theory for the development of schizophrenia is that a weak blood-brain barrier causes chronic brain inflammation. This triggers the release of adrenaline that then accumulates in the brain and isn't cleared out properly, causing it to oxidize and form adrenochrome. This compound is a psychedelic that causes the SZ sufferer to have an LSD-like trip while it is present, which results in hallucinations and metaphysical occurrences like synchronicities. It's like a gateway to the spiritual realm, but SZ sufferers are ""gating"" *too hard*, to the point it's completely overwhelming.

That state of extreme gating is like a bubble reality where you can't level with regular people anymore. You lose the ability to experience a great deal of randomness, and every conversation seems to center around you. Videos are especially prone to this. Sometimes books and memes are like ""nods"" to your situation as well. It's like too much of a good thing.

Religions may be predicated on this phenomenon to bestow adherents a bit of ""spiritual favor"" (stress may generate a small amount of adrenochrome to that end) but the SZ sufferer's brain is like drinking from a spiritual firehose all the time. It's a completely different reality.

So how do you dial the ""gating"" down?

I have some theories. Trying Daily Essential Nutrients and Pulsed Electronic Magnetic Field therapy to heal my blood-brain barrier. Also taking antipsychotics and Amyloban to reduce the brain inflammation. The first two have some chance of healing the damage, but it's slow going."

Want to be critical about Piracetam though. The emotional boost is addictive, and it messes with blood brain barrier permeability. Abusing it actually *gave* me schizophrenia."

Maybe you eat something rich in that, also."

I totally feel that way too."
schizophrenia,fq4op58,t3_ggtlf9,1589080646.0,"Truman show stuff is pretty common with SZ. 

I promise that you're not the only real person on earth and everyone is just an actor. That's like some false breakaway reality that happens when you have a certain amount of brain damage. It's complicated to explain though.

Basically you want to get to the pre-SZ state where you were just some regular guy / gal and were pretty much ignored. That requires healing the internal damage."
schizophrenia,fq4o45i,t1_fq4myi4,1589080293.0,"No problem! I am very confident in this technology, but at present there isn't a lot of competition so the devices are kind of pricey. The PEMF device I'm using is $395 USD for example.

No one buy the PEMF device linked until I have full results. Please.

You will definitely need a good multivitamin, with a separate calcium, magnesium, and B-complex pill though. Those aren't very expensive. Like each one is around $20 for 2-3 months worth. PEMF increases the uptake of those nutrients.

This sounds odd but you'll need like 3 tsp of ground cloves a day as well, that's a great source of antioxidants. Like, the best source. Completely eclipses fruit and veg (though your diet should be adequate as well.) PEMF uses that stuff up as well.

There's a lot of info to give you but I have to be patient and wait for results.


https://forum.schizophrenia.com/t/pemf-therapy-pulsed-electronic-magnetic-field-therapy-self-test/196720 is my brain dump on PEMF technology though. Thread got locked because a guy cried foul at my fast results.

Daily Essential Nutrients is kind of expensive ($100 USD a month), so I'm trying to break away from them in favor of the cheaper vitamins / minerals that are not as bioavailable. I figure even the cheap ones are used up effectively due to PEMF's acceleration of the healing process. I have to test this.

I have like one and a half bottles of DEN just sitting there now, because of the need to test the cheap stuff, so this treatment is more approachable."
schizophrenia,fq4ktau,t3_ggsxae,1589079008.0,"I had marginal luck, but Vitamin C in excess raises TGF-Beta. Which means bone spurs and joint problems down the line.

Niacin supposedly lowers TGF-Beta bioavailability but it causes insulin resistance (which incidentally Vitamin C reverses, but not perfectly.)

Niacin megadoses make my facial skin start flaking. I can't help but wonder what else internally it's affecting.

I'm trying PEMF therapy right now. I will get back to you if I have a breakthrough. I'm improving fast though, but it's only day 5 right now. I might plateau or fall apart completely. Can't tell until at least 2 weeks."
