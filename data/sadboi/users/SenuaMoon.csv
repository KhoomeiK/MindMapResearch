ptsd,fqxmf6t,t3_gl8qxt,1589734553.0,"I'm wondering what kind of people you are surrounding yourself with that would say such outlandish and ignorant stuff. Most people i don't even bother telling. That is what online communities are for. To talk with people who understand who have been through it too. People who haven't tend to be willfully ignorant and see things through tunnel vision. Only once have I had someone say some dumb ”why don't you just move past it” shit. Later I had to school him and tell him that his statement was triggering because that's not how trauma works. He apologized and said that right after he said it he realized how bad it was.

Some people who have never been through anything and also don't have people in their lives who have ptsd think that those statements ate helpfully or that it's a positive way to look at the situation. It's like a cat trying to tell a lion how to be the best lion. They may MEAN well but their lack of education on the effects of trauma makes it hard for them to understand our plight.

But that is just me playing the devils advocate because in the situation with that guy he really didn't mean to be harsh, he was just ignorant of how trauma works, so I did didn't hold it against him. Whenever you see an opportunity to school someone on the lasting effects of trauma always take it. People need to be educated and steered in the right direction sometimes. They may end up changing the way that they think about how ptsd works. 

If anyone ever tried my life and said that my abuse wasn't that big of a deal I would tell them that I was in such danger that I had to live at a doesn't violence shelter as awaited my trial for an infection. All the while I had to go to work and work with kids and pretend like nothing was happening. All the while the abuser was living in MY apartment trying to get me kicked out (luckily I had a cop explain to them how dangerous he was and they were very supportive.) and that's only HALF the story. There is no ”getting over” that. Only moving forward and trying not to look back.

If I turned around and looked at the shadow behind me that is decades of trauma it would destroy me. I have to press on."

And you're right about not everyone recovering the same. I recovered from BPD BECAUSE of the fact that my life got so rough and I was so alone that most all of the symptoms were beat out of me. I didn't really need therapy. I take my meds and occasionally study my DBT book but my life is what healed me. I never would have thought back to back trauma and pain could TAKE away the bpd lol. But like you said, you are strong. And as long as you get up each time you are knocked down then each time you will stand up with a new type of strength and understanding. I think wisdom, maturity, self-awareness, and the WILLINGNESS to face the hard facts about your bpd is the first step in the journy. I've had bpd since my tween years, got formally diagnosed in 2017 after a epic meltdown and can say I fully recovered by the end of 2019, but not was it a ROUGH, ROUGH ride."

I'll just ask myself hard questions and try to answer them honestly. I used to journal every day but I fell off. Journaling is super healthy. One thing that helped me recover was going on long quiet walks every morning at the park. It was my time to silence the chatter and just enjoy the beauty of nature.

relationship_advice,fpczbdh,t3_gcr889,1588516414.0,"F perspective:

If a guy liked you then you will see it in his actions, like you said. My theory is that NOBODY and I mean NOBODY is that busy or allergic to technology 😂. Those are bullshit excuses. If he really liked you and wanted to get to know you then he would be excited to talk, not the other way around! In fact, after FOUR months it should be phone calls by now in my opinion. He's stringing you along. Don't make his sad excuses of wooing you put him on a higher pedestal than he deserves to be on. 

Unless he is an ER doctor or in the FBI there is no reason that he can't have longer and better conversations with you .

Unfortunately, since you had sex with him for that long, but without commitment of any kind, he probably didn't have to make that much of an effort and now he feels like he ""got what he wanted out of the deal"" I always advise women that, unless you ALSO see the guy as a ""good time only"" situationship then it's better to hold out on sex. Men are biologically inclined to want to hunt a woman. Their testosterone levels increase when they are trying to win a woman over (a.k.a get in her pants) because in A.D. that was the end goal (to spread their seed). Though we are in modern days, those biological inclinations still exist within them.  However, when a woman has sex with the guy early on, the vasopressin released after he cums (a.k.a the love hormone) decreases through time and the interest levels also decrease (this is not all men, but many) but the woman's vasopressin continues to increase and she begins to really like the guy romantically, whereas the guy becomes sort of ""meh"" to the idea of her.

People like to be in denial of how much biology, sex, pursuit etc. has a role in dating and that is why so many people end up shit outta luck. When you rush into something without the much needed pursuit period, things can grow stale really quickly for the guy. But the woman is already in deep emotionally and still really wants it to work.

He's not as interested ANYMORE but there is still a chance to win him back. I'm a Claircognizant and I specialize in relationship advising so if you want help with your situation hit me up in my DM's and we can see if we can fix this but maintain your dignity as well

**Tips from Medical News Today:**

 

It is important to listen to the person with depression and express empathy, which is the ability to understand and share someone else’s feelings. One way to demonstrate empathy is to reflect what the person says.

For example, if they say, “I just feel like things will never get better,” their partner can reflect that by saying, “It sounds as though you are not hopeful about the future.”

Continually trying to cheer the person up is not helpful as this invalidates their condition and their feelings. Phrases such as “tomorrow will be better” or “try to cheer up” do not take into account the nature of the illness.

 

While recovery from depression is possible, it can be challenging at times. To support a partner during the recovery process:

* help them keep track of their appointments and medications
* do some physical activity together most days
* plan and prepare healthful meals together
* try to reduce stressors in the home
* make goals small and achievable
* encourage them to socialize with others
* plan fun activities together
* point out the person’s progress on their journey to recovery
* avoid forcing treatment on the person

Let them know that they are not alone by saying things such as:

relationship_advice,fo95u14,t3_g6ez21,1587611227.0,"Well he has never done it so maybe he is afraid because he won't know what he is doing and doesn't want to look stupid. I'm sure if you offered a bj he would be more than excited. Tell him the only way you can get off is if you get eaten out and that you can show him how. If he refuses then tell him that you aint interested. Most guys will make the sacrifice if pussy is promised lmao. Good luck!

 I could understand if she was on the verge of eviction or desperate for food or something but to do it just for kick isn't right. But everyone on this Earth has a different idea of what is moral integrity and what is not. They probably think it's a joke and were not raised to be considerate of their actions towards other people. Doesn't make her a bad person, she just has a character flaw. If you can separate her from her actions then you can still be friends, but if that is not the type of people who you like to surround yourself with then drop her. I am a huge believer in Karma and if she isn't careful she will get her just deserved and then want you there as support when it happens then all you can do is sit back and take a huge sip of the ""I told you so."" cup. Some people are great but just dumb.

My ex-best friend faked a pregnancy in an attempt to trap a guy into a relationship. She was so desperate for him I rooted for her at first but then when I saw the lengths that she was going to and how long she was drawing it out I had to tell her what she was doing was fucked up. She eventually did the right thing and told him it was fake and after that she, and our friendship were never the same. The whole situation sent her into a deep depression and I tried to be there as a friend but she did it to herself.

&#x200B;

You can keep your friend. You don't have to like and agree with everything that she does. If the friendship is worth it, all you can do is say ""hey, I don't support this, it goes against my moral integrity so you do you and if it doesn't end well don't come crying to me."" Good luck.

I require a lot of details so that I can gage the situation to make sure I'm accurate so only message if you are ready to be open and honest with specific details. 

I'm best with relationship stuff such as love, dating, friendships etc. DM me and I'll help you.

I don't do specifics such as time and dates. More of a 'what you can expect from the situation' type of reading.

relationship_advice,fo70v1c,t3_g62ogy,1587570266.0,"One can experience deep love for another person and not just one. I believe one can have several soulmates roaming around on this Earth. If you are lucky enough to find them then you won the jackpot. Most people give up and settle for whoever is nice to them and will simply stick around.

 The road to love ain't easy and most people give up halfway through when obstacles arrive. But when you find a soulmate, you tough through it and it leads to a long, healthy and lasting union. 

So yeah, I believe in soulmates and that you can have multiple in the universe and that if you're lucky you will find them."
dating_advice,fo6zfzw,t1_fo20xxb,1587569548.0,"It's super hard. I did notice though that one of the reasons that I obsessed over crushes so hard was because it was a distraction from me having to deal with my own issues in my life. It was easier to throw myself into a deep infatuation with every nice guy who talked to me than to get to know myself and love myself first. This resulted in me allowing myself to be treated like shit by any guy who gave me the slightest bit of attention. At 23 I had to go on a ""alone challenge"" (is what I called it). I stopped dating apps, stopped talking to men, stopped obsessing over them etc. I wanted to accept being alone and being okay with it. My phone was so dry, but eventually it stopped bothering me 

A lot of people, especially highly sensative people, feel like we are missing something if we don't either have a crush or are dating someone. Getting lost in the idea of being with someone is an enjoyable distraction in our lives because the walking down the beach hand in hand images are endless. However, when we do this we set ourselves up for a great deal of hurt if the other person rejects us.

Since we already fantasized about them to such an extreme degree it's like they broke off a relationship that had already formed in our heads in which they were this perfect, attractive, funny, smart, sexy person when in reality they are probably just mediocre lmao. 

Try not to focus so much on her and focus on the type of man you want to be for any woman. Do you need a better job? Do you work out? Do you have hobbies? Good grades? Drive to succeed? Style? These are all things that will increase your dating outcomes and instead of obsessing over one chick you will have three begging for your attention lol. Maybe this chick will even be so impressed she will be desperate to be with you 

All im saying is, don't allow a crush to stand in the way of your personal growth. As much as we idealize people, in actuality, they are not perfect and shouldn't be placed on a pedestal they haven't earned stepping onto yet."

relationship_advice,fo5npll,t1_fo5mj51,1587530330.0,The fact that you said you feel like you are walking on eggshells when trying to speak to her is concerning and not normal in a relationship at all. Do you know if she suffers from any mental health issues or has any serious past trauma? Does she exhibit any other qualities that seem like bullying or emotional neglect towards you? DM me if you want privacy.
