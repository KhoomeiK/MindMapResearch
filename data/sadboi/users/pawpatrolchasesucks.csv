bipolar,fjt4rei,t1_fjp2n31,1583604018.0,i smoke all day every day but when i'm manic it doesn't give me an appetite it's just fun and helps me sleep
bipolar,fjoyqpz,t3_femclb,1583537729.0,"absolutely! you can have good within the bad and bad within the good

edit: for me it usually means i need to eat something"
bipolar,feb6zhj,t3_eob370,1578955992.0,"it's up to you. this illness is something that connects all of us, but it doesn't define us. be realistic but don't mold your life around your mental illness. whatever interests you that you can do with the level of education you're willing to purse is what's the best career for you"
bipolar,feb6pj5,t3_eobrjp,1578955904.0,"honestly my best advice on this (as someone with bp1 and anorexia who has struggled with meds for YEARS) is to find a really good therapist. maybe it's through a program instead of just an independent therapist or something but i know i got really attached to the first therapist i had who didn't completely suck and halted a lot of my progress by sticking with her for so long. this is a very, very real frustration and i hope the medical professionals in your life listen to your concerns and you can be happy one day. but you're definitely not alone and it sucks to KNOW it's superficial to care so much about weight but not be able to stop it. the options seem like weight vs meds but there's also exploring your life in a different way and reprogramming your brain to see things differently. i hope this makes some bit of sense. basically, allow yourself to feel the frustration and then find ways to live with it. if you need other people to help you find those ways, that is fine. i'm sending you love and support"
bipolar,f92z712,t3_e3gem9,1575045744.0,"sleep at the same time every day! eat foods containing serotonin or magnesium before bed to help with that (kiwi, nuts, broccoli, meat, etc.). fish oil and cbd can help a bit. meditate at night and when you first wake up. yoga is a good calming way to get exercise without going too wild. mostly if you feel yourself becoming manic then try to do the opposite of what your brain is saying. it wants you to go out and go clubbing till 3 am? stay in and watch calm movies/tv. there aren't very many anti-mania substitutes besides meds but it is possible to control/ward off for a bit. best of luck to you!"

bipolar,f8yqxuu,t3_e2w91a,1574951568.0,"meds were okay but not as effective as lifestyle changes in my opinion. think a lot of people on here are off meds, on the wrong meds, or not making healthy lifestyle choices. some people do everything right and are still cycling a bit but that's just something to keep in mind when you see posts about mania or severe depression and stuff"
ratterriers,f8vnm8b,t3_e2hi0s,1574873473.0,so cute omg!!!!
bipolar,f8vnl3w,t3_e2hjhy,1574873453.0,"i know it hurts now and that's okay. i'm here for you when things are bad, not just when they're good. i love all of you, whatever that may mean.

i've said this to people and had it said to me and it's the only thing to really make me feel better. i hate when people try to fix my problems or tell me to take meds or whatever. just acknowledging my feelings and being there for me means everything"
StudentNurse,f8tcfrw,t3_e23x53,1574800475.0,"the app ""pocket prep"" is free and gives you 80 questions plus a free daily question but you can pay for more. also i'd recommend looking up free practice tests and flashcards online. if you're willing to spend money then ATI's prep stuff is really good. cheaper option (relatively speaking) that i did was get one of their practice tests bc they use some of the same questions on the real test. look over all that stuff and you can figure out what kind of topics are going to be covered and then look at youtube videos (crashcourse is great) on the subjects. good luck!"
bipolar,f8knsel,t1_f8kn39n,1574613170.0,well lamictal is one of two mood stabilizers that doesn't cause weight gain and that's usually bc they act as a bit of an appetite suppressant so that could have something to do with it
asl,f8kn8xn,t3_e0zmzk,1574613055.0,"my first teacher in high school was deaf and she taught with handouts/writing on the board/powerpoint presentations that had pictures on them until we could catch up. sometimes she had a translator in or a more advanced student to help out. they don't expect you to know anything or to accommodate them. they'll find ways to teach you, don't worry :)"
bipolar,f8kmv9r,t3_e10e4b,1574612867.0,yeah that was a manic thing for me and it was pretty bad when i was on lamictal. never connected it to the meds tho bc it was my first time on them and i just assumed they would only do good things for me lol
bipolar,f8eq2uc,t3_e0khq2,1574531863.0,i used to take geodon. take it at night and make sure you have it with food. it sedated me like nobody's business and i had to take other meds to offset that. it was great for mania but didn't really do anything for depression for me. no weight gain though and that was awesome
bipolar,f85wc22,t3_dz8cfj,1574284565.0,"personally every mood stabilizer including lamictal has made me break out and was a huge contributor to me going off them (NOT the path for everyone and i've worked with many therapists and psychiatrists in this decision). i had really bad acne since i was 11 and did accutane at 17 which cleared it up but then was diagnosed bipolar like 4 months later and the meds made my skin break out. it's not a given that the meds will make you break out, i just have bad luck. it's worth trying and if you break out and it really bothers you then talk to your pdoc about switching meds"
bipolar,f829zei,t3_dyo1v1,1574187093.0,"i'm only on an antidepressant rn and i feel a lot better that way honestly. i lean more towards mania typically and meds usually make me spiral into depression or mixed episodes and the side effects suck. for me, lifestyle changes and intense coping skills have been key. i haven't been off my mood stabilizer very long so idk how it'll go especially in spring but i feel more stable rn than when i was on it idk"
bipolar,f829onc,t3_dyn25g,1574186922.0,"meds are not a magic cure, no matter how much you want them to be. putting in the work to maintain a healthy lifestyle and finding solid coping mechanisms as well as identifying triggers for mania and depression and finding ways to bring yourself down are just as important if not more so. regulated sleep is absolutely key. make sure you have a good, honest support system and don't be afraid to ask for help if you have a setback or something. monitor your meds' side effects and communicate with your doctor if they're troublesome or something you can't tolerate. you can live a very happy and successful life if you put the work in! best of luck to you!"
bipolar,f829dy9,t3_dyngje,1574186744.0,lack of motivation for anything that doesn't interest me. it's making college very hard bc not every class that's required is going to be the most interesting and i find it hard to put the work into those bc i never had to work growing up. also failing to meet my own ridiculously high expectations for myself due to laziness and things just being harder has resulted in a lot of self hatred and resentment. working through it in therapy now though
bipolar,f8295v7,t3_dynsv8,1574186607.0,"i'm doing pretty well right now! it's taken a lot of intense treatment and hard work from me but i'd consider myself happy. i've kept up some long term friendships and recently ended a serious relationship (unrelated to BP). i'm 20 rn and going to graduate in spring with a bachelor's in psych and then do 2 years of nursing school. i'm bp1 and eight months ago was completely unmedicated, having a 3 month long manic episode, had psychosis and a suicide attempt. things get better but you HAVE to be willing to put in the work. meds aren't a magic cure and therapy seriously helps if you find good people. you'll have bad days and setbacks but once you get solid coping skills in place, you'll stop spiraling so much and be way more in control. wishing you the best of luck!

sidenote: don't let online stories scare you. a lot of people here are looking for help in their lowest moments so you see a lot of worst case scenarios. many people with bipolar go on to live successful, happy lives"

bipolar,f78qotw,t1_f76pznu,1573497065.0,yeah it was like the other person said like smoking triggered a mixed episode and then the mixed episode lasted beyond the effects of the weed. i've smoked a lot of different times and all but like 2 did that to me

bipolar,f3pg9us,t3_dhmx6d,1571058561.0,it's just a suggestion but for me it helps tremendously with anxiety and mania to not drink caffeine. i found out that certain types of coffee are worse than others and that coffee is almost positively a no-go and same with energy drinks but chai tea/lattes are okay so maybe try caffeinated tea instead and see how it makes you feel if you're not willing to give it up entirely
bipolar,f3h1gbn,t1_f3fvlb9,1570917628.0,i think it's mostly about doing your best to identify it in the moment and then make corrective behaviors. it'll take a while and you won't be perfect but it'll be worth it in the end

bipolar,f3b5k6j,t3_dgah0q,1570802224.0,i tell someone about it. saying it out loud helps me realize how crazy i sound and i'm better able to keep it toned down. otherwise idk if there's much to do besides meds. after the fact i apologize and explain to the best of my ability but time helps the embarrassment of it the most. i hope things get better for you
bipolar,f38gi78,t3_dg0wxx,1570736379.0,i get this way when depressed and i try to keep only healthier options around. for chips i do either skinny pop popcorn or sunchips and for chocolate cravings i do either the 70 calorie fiber one brownies or chocolate covered pretzels. otherwise fruit is really good and you can binge grapes pretty easily. stuff like oranges are nice tho bc they take more time to eat and slow you down. having designated times to eat helps a lot. for example i eat breakfast when i wake up and always eat lunch at 12:30 then have a snack at 3 and eat dinner between 5-6:30 and then have a snack at 9:30pm and that works for me. snack is allowed to be a piece of fruit plus one serving of something unhealthy. single serve bags of chips are better to have around than one big bag. hope some of this helps you!
bipolar,f2n6m4s,t3_ddt3db,1570312649.0,i have about equally half and half and i just spent 6 months in a manic episode with psychotic features and it was hell. felt decently isolated bc most resources/things you hear about are for the depression side. currently in a depression but have to say you're not alone and honestly i hate mania and psychosis as much if not more than depression so i really really hope you're doing okay. they're far more destructive in my experience
bipolar,f2hei4i,t3_ddgl39,1570242674.0,"personally i need my AP to even be able to function. i'm BP1 with psychotic features and recently spent 6 months off meds where i destroyed every relationship i had and did all i could to ruin my life while manic and psychotic. also i hate everything associated with aging and there's no way i'm letting myself live to be old so i'm killing myself by 35, 40 AT MOST so why not take something that will make me moderately stable now? all i know is i CANNOT function without it and i'm living my life to make me happy in the moment. there is no long term for me so those effects, if they're true which i admittedly have not researched, don't matter. this is only my take though and honestly i kinda hope your post gets take down bc psychosis is nothing to fuck around with and it's kinda sick to think you're more knowledgable than peoples' doctors and you don't know the path they've had to take to find stability. i hope you find peace in your life but this was not a good thing to post here"
bipolar,f2criym,t3_dcxo6k,1570141612.0,every time i wait 1.5-3 hours for mine (not exaggerating. they even have a sign up telling you to expect to wait 90 min or more) and it sucks but he's the best and i don't wanna deal with another pdoc
bipolar,f25nd9l,t3_dc15ex,1569978913.0,take them in small bits. i have tons of small goals that add up to big goals. for example if i do my assignments for wednesday night and thursday night then i've accomplished my goal. eventually that will lead to me graduating and becoming a nurse. take it day by day instead of a big scary thing and it helps a lot. be proud of yourself for little accomplishments
bipolar,f25n5v0,t3_dc2e9t,1569978766.0,makes it worse that the meds take all my emotions away. constantly worried what is or isn't me. at this point i'm just trying to follow my treatment plan and accepting that even if my emotions are extreme and due to mental illness they're MINE and i need to experience them. sorry if this makes no sense lol but yeah i get how you feel and it's a HUGE issue
bipolar,f25n0nl,t3_dc2gc8,1569978662.0,yeah that's some bullshit and super frustrating and i'm sorry you have to go through it. it's hard enough to motivate yourself to get help without having to constantly admit that you need help! also it shouldn't matter what kind of appointment it is like if she said she would help then she should just help! i'm proud of you for getting the help and juggling all of this but yeah super frustrating for sure
ratterriers,f25mus1,t3_dc2j14,1569978543.0,so cute!!! what's their name?
bipolar,f25mtjp,t3_dc2p0b,1569978519.0,i'm glad it worked out for you (unless i misunderstood) but yeah the system is FUCKED. i currently have sooo much ritalin on hand just from filling prescriptions as they were given to me like damn they really don't check this at all lol
bipolar,f25mno2,t3_dc2n2r,1569978400.0,"eat kiwi, turkey, or nuts bc those help and also make sure you lie in the dark and don't go on your phone or anything. it was also helpful for me to learn that just resting (lying in the dark doing nothing) is beneficial even if you can't fall asleep! takes some pressure off. oh and doing some exercise like 4 hours before is good so you're physically tired but the mental stimulation of it has worn off. hope this helped!"
bipolar,f258wg0,t1_f2014s5,1569968692.0,it's definitely not helping. i can't smoke weed bc it throws me into paranoid mixed episodes and rn i'm just at a point where it is so hard to be sober. i'm about to try an intensive outpatient program tho and they make you stop drinking so we'll see how that goes
bipolar,f258q1n,t1_f1yq3ei,1569968569.0,"i've actually been working to try and do intensive outpatient at a facility near me but it's been hard bc it conflicts with a night class of mine. worked with the professor, my school's disability office, and the facility and i think i'll be able to do it thankfully"
bipolar,f243rvf,t3_dbuxa2,1569944261.0,i'm holding out hope for stability in the future. things are supposed to calm down as you get older. doesn't make it any less frustrating and unfair now though and i'm sorry you're feeling this way bc it's a shitty way to feel
bipolar,f243blp,t1_f22fss9,1569943961.0,lmaoooo yea i started this account to make a joke rant post against paw patrol with my friends and now i mostly use it for mental health and serious things and very rarely someone will catch it and call me out and it's so funny
bipolar,f21z9z0,t3_dbiau9,1569878803.0,"i've called 3 times and was only actively suicidal during one of them. i was put on hold for about a minute every time and they weren't super helpful tbh like they didn't know what to say to my problems BUT talking to someone who wasn't connected to my life and just having someone listen helped calm me down so much. when i was actively suicidal i spent the whole call trying to convince the person i wasn't going to kill myself so she wouldn't feel bad but by the time i hung up i actually felt much better and ended up just going to sleep instead. 

tldr: they weren't very helpful but the act of talking was and i recommend it"
bipolar,f1ygrt3,t3_db5gnb,1569816007.0,yes. like i just can't explain how i'm feeling but i need someone to just get it
bipolar,f1ygkpk,t1_f1yg0j7,1569815903.0,used to be that way for me but rn i need more intensive care than i have and i can't do it bc i have to live my life. i'm really genuinely happy it helps you though and hope it continues to do so
bipolar,f1yd77g,t1_f1ybe10,1569814103.0,it's exhausting and i'm sorry you feel this way too
bipolar,f1y8rgq,t3_db4qqy,1569811724.0,me too lmaooo it fucking sucks and i hope your night gets better but if it doesn't then there's always tomorrow
