Yes, it was painful and I cried while talking about it, but I’m so glad that I talked about it. They assured me that I didn’t do anything wrong and shouldn’t feel like I was at fault.

My heart goes out to you. It sounds like you’re in a lot of pain. I can relate to thoughts of suicide. I hear what you are saying about wanting people to care about you. That’s understandable. It sounds like you’ve had some difficult times. 

Is there anyway that you can do online therapy with someone? Therapy has helped me process a lot of painful stuff. 

Please don’t do anything to harm yourself. You are 17 and life can get better. I’ve been in the lowest of places and felt like there was zero hope. I was wrong. I’ve came close to suicide a few times and I’m so thankful I didn’t follow through because my mind and the depression was deceiving me. It beats you down. So I just want you to know you are not alone. I’m just a message away if you need to talk. 

Also a good resource is the suicide prevention hotline. 
I believe there’s a few numbers posted above. 

Sending you a hug. ❤️"
