depression_help,fr0cxrj,t3_glva1y,1589791199.0,"Hey! Like the other responder mentioned - we care about you! Your feelings are valid. I'm sorry that you are not in a situation where you are being taken seriously when you try and express yourself. There is no good reason for someone to laugh at your displays of emotion. I've dealt with this reaction as well, and I worry about my own feelings being invalid... but feelings, emotions, and thoughts are ours to have. They are all perfectly OK and valid. Sometimes the way we deal with emotions needs to be addressed if it causes pain or dysfunction, but the emotion itself is always OK to have. I'm sorry that you aren't being treated with respect when you try to express yourself. Friendships are very hard for me to start and maintain as well. But maintaining the few I do have has gotten easier with the more distance I've been able to put between my thoughts - emotions - and actions. I don't always react the way I'm tempted to when I feel they don't really like me. For instance I will ride that emotion out, journal about it, etc. instead of seeking their reassurance. Therapy and medication have both helped me SO much. I like to say medication saved my life because I've been to my rock bottom where I couldn't stop thinking of offing myself (even though I didn't want to die I was just overwhelmed with pain), and medication addressed that particular aspect of suffering. In therapy I'm learning how to deal with my emotions and thoughts and create distance between them and myself so they don't absolutely engulf me and disable me. I hope you can access these things, because you deserve to feel better! And sometimes we can't get there easily, sometimes we need help - and that's OK! You are valid and you are worth it. I'll be here if talking will help, and I'm wishing you the best!"
therapy,fq5h4fl,t3_gguftl,1589105199.0,"I read through your post, it was not boring. Your emotions are valid, even when other people or environmental demands may have you thinking otherwise. If every time you do/say/don't do something it upsets your mother and she gets sick, it doesn't change the fact that you do feel things/go through things and that it's okay to experience those emotions and have needs. However you need to handle it at the moment (which seems to be to pretend it doesn't exist) I hope that you know you're still valid. The theme that I'm getting (which may be completely wrong) is that your life feels chaotic and you don't seem to know what to do with your emotions, maybe not even how to accept that you're allowed to have them. But feeling things and having needs is human, it isn't something that makes you a burden. You are allowed and expected to take up space in this world - and I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say that I'm glad you're here. The family dynamic you have is complex and I'm not sure what advice I have beyond telling you that it's okay that it's hard. I think your mother has a lot of love for you despite her own problems, and it seems to me that it's become your internalized responsibility to account for her problems out of love for her. It's okay if that's hard. You have problems and emotions and needs, too. You are important. I hope that you will continue on because I believe in your ability to be happy, even if the journey there can be challenging and takes time. I'm glad that this quarantine has provided you with the opportunity for some relief, even if it is temporary. Hold onto and remember the feelings of being okay going forward. As permanent as the pain feels, situations can and will change. You have the ability to get to the other side of these struggles - you deserve to do so. You deserve to experience your emotions and acknowledge how things make you feel and to do what you can do to help soothe yourself (I hope you will put thought into some self soothing techniques or options during times of distress). I personally am investigating DBT, and there are specific distress tolerance skills that I plan to try out in my own life, perhaps they would be helpful for you as well? You deserve to be happy. It's okay that you're struggling right now 💜"

It really bothered my ex when I casually mentioned how (especially early on in our relationship) I could not picture his face. Like he left and I'd have to look at pictures. It would bother me and make me feel weird, but I didn't see it as a big deal. Apparently it was a big deal to him though, it seemed to hurt him so much. Maybe he could easily picture me when I was gone? And couldn't possibly understand I could still love him and not be able to easily picture him?"

I'd love to feel better sooner, but slow progress is still progress and I'm thankful for all the things I can do now because of the meds and therapy (i.e. I can pick up prescriptions without much trouble now).

Thanks, I'll check it out!"
Anxiety,fpnjgax,t1_fpnel63,1588764884.0,"Yeah, I was randomly paired (off campus student housing). I'm lucky compared to last year because my last 3 roomates were terrible to me (always made me feel unwelcome, only included me when they wanted me to pay for something, I heard them talking negatively about me whenever they brought friends over, etc.), and these 3 are super nice. It's just a personal issue I have. I eventually put a microwave in my room because I'd go a day, maybe 2 eating like only snacks (crackers, chips) so I wouldn't have to interact with my roomates to use the microwave (not even considering how hard it is for me to go to the store by myself). I also put my own trashcan in here so I'm not responsible for the main one, eliminating that drama. You don't want to know how long it's been since I've done laundry... When I do laundry I'm hyper aware of every sound and movement in the apartment - especially the sound of the laundry room doors opening/closing. When I hear that I get overwhelmed by the fear that maybe they were planning to use it and might be upset. I really hope I never have to have roomates again after college, but rent is expensive. It's just stressful not having anywhere to retreat besides the confines of my room."

I've stopped answering I get so anxious I just freeze up, so they leave me notes now. I avoid shared living spaces at all costs. One time all 3 of my roomates came out into the kitchen at once and surrounded me (they were being friendly but I nearly cried in front of them it was so overwhelming). It's actually a really big problem lol cause the kitchen and laundry room are important things to use. I manage to stay alive though. But yes. 24/7.

AmItheAsshole,fplhqj8,t3_ge06g6,1588712921.0,"NTA. I think family members sometimes treat us like children until we enforce the idea that we are in fact  adults. It's great that you stood up for yourself and enforced your boundaries. You deserve to have boundaries and to expect them to be respected. Your boundary is reasonable - your car is not to be used by others. They continued to cross that boundary after you established it clearly and politely, then got upset when you inevitably reacted to such a disrespectful chain of events. You are not obligated to react how they want you to (to just accept it I guess?). I think it's great that you recognize you don't deserve that."
BPD,fplg5u1,t1_fplfhha,1588712114.0,"I absolutely agree. I've felt addicted to sugar for a while now, and the more I give in the less I enjoy it but the more I crave it. It's a viscious cycle because if I go without it for a while it tastes so good and I just begin the same habits again. I haven't really tried to replace eating with any other coping mechanisms but I probably should at least try to. I'm not sure what else could be as satisfying."
BPD,fplewu0,t3_gdwo24,1588711484.0,"Whenever I feel a weird empty feeling I associate it with craving soda. I'm not sure if it's related to my mental health or not, but that carbonation really hits the spot and it might be because it fills me up. I drink sparkling water mixed with a flavor additive, or zero calorie soda these days. If I'm hungry nonstop all day protein packed snacks help me the most (20+ grams at a time), but I'm vegetarian and I tend to reach for candy instead of protein sources so my body really needs it lol. I also have an unhealthy relationship with food though. Something about if I ""deserve"" to eat or not. So if I'm SUPER upset, it's not hard at all to avoid eating or to eat only the bare minimum. But if I'm only moderately stressed or upset I'm reaching for that satisfaction (most of the time). Who doesn't like to feel gratification about being deserving and good enough? But then I look in the mirror and feel the exact opposite."
depression,fpjpq0s,t3_gdv7qt,1588677230.0,"Yes. I had a teacher email me to see if I had forgotten to unregister from their class. I had to explain that no, I'm just failing to be a student lol but I assured them I would try harder to participate and not to miss deadlines. Yeah, hasn't really happened. The feeling of meaninglessness of everything and/or existential dread combined with being overwhelmed just thinking of opening my assignments isn't great. My natural tendency towards procrastination has not helped since I'm currently missing the driving force not to fail (conveniently replaced by a feeling of pointlessness of doing anything at all and a desire to stay in bed alllll day). Plus it would be sooo hard to do literally anything at all, you know? Ugh I hate being so close to the end just to fuck myself over like this. We can probably do this, hopefully."
AnxietyDepression,fpjp0gs,t3_gdugc6,1588676548.0,"It doesn't sound like you're a bad person. It sounds like you're worried about the thought of being a bad person. And it doesn't sound like you're asking to think about that (maybe it's an intrusive thought?). Thoughts and worries are not the same as actions and reality. I struggle with what I believe to be OCD and at the worst times I have also felt extremely guilty and like a bad person, I'd have thoughts and worries about being dangerous / not deserving to live / being a bad person. I think it's safe to assume something you value is the lives of others - which makes this fair game for intrusive thoughts, since you're likely to react to such a theme. Maybe do some research on OCD, specifically harm OCD?

I don't mean to try and offer a diagnosis or assume that I know what you're going through well enough to come to any reasonable conclusions about that. I'm not an expert and I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. I'm just hoping my input can be somewhat comforting even if only to know that you're not alone. It sounds like it's overwhelming right now, I'm sorry that you're going through this. Hopefully you can access some therapy, either online or otherwise once you're able."
AmItheAsshole,fpj06wt,t1_fphk176,1588653039.0,"I remember when I was this age I didn't have a good grasp on internet safety and good boundaries with others on the internet. When I couldn't be online to talk to other people (over multiplayer games) I got very anxious because they mattered (too much) to me. Just talking from experience here it may be good to talk to her about good boundaries to have with others over the internet (not giving out information such as a phone number or street address, not entering into any ""relationships"", being aware just how easy it is to be lied to about someone's identity/age/intentions, etc.) I also did things to get ""free"" online gaming currency because the game - specifically the other players I was friends with - mattered a lot to me (too much). So basic internet safety but also a focus on why she is so concerned about getting back to the game. It probably shouldn't create any anxiety other than sadness over losing a fun gaming experience, otherwise that might be a potential red flag. I mean absolutely no disrespect, I just know at that age I generally made poor choices and didn't understand all of the intricacies involved or the gravity of my decisions."
mentalillness,fph8pt7,t3_gdasge,1588616935.0,"I struggle with what you're describing your boyfriend as going through as well. I have on and off since I was a child (22 now). I finally began going to therapy about 6 months ago at the end of a relationship. I have yet to bring up the specific intrusive thoughts that make me feel like a bad person. I've started with easier topics and eased into my deeper struggles, as I feared judgement from a stranger. But that fear however illogical it may seem does exist, that someone else whom I'm confessing the worst things to will judge me as a bad person and tell me I somehow want to experience those thoughts. But again, it's all a part of it. I think he might benefit from starting online, doing a little research on OCD and intrusive thoughts. That really helped me a lot, learning that intrusive thoughts were not something unique to me and not something I wanted to experience and/or definitive of my character. Also something my therapist said the other day really resonated with me ""information is a gift you choose to give to other people"" not an obligation as I often see it, or a requirement that they know all the details so they can somehow make an informed decision and decide if I'm worthy of their attention and love (and at the same time I get reassurance that I am not as bad of a person as I think I am, that these things are not dealbreakers to someone else). Hopefully that is somewhat helpful to you, I know I've never been on your side of the situation but I'm really sorry that you're both going through this struggle."
ROCD,fpf7zpf,t3_gd21vv,1588563998.0,"Hey girl. Your story really resonated with me. I thought of a time I was analyzing my every thought and action, and always feeling guilty. I don't want that for you or anyone else.

I'm a student too, so I regularly interacted with people in my classes as well. My last relationship really triggered my mental illness hard when my ex basically said I shouldn't be attracted to anyone else (and apparently I was having dreams of others, which he threatened to leave if they didn't stop). So I would inevitably be going through life, see someone attractive, and analyze and overanalyze every single part of my interaction with them. Did I look too long? Did I talk to them because I wanted them, would they be in my dream if I didn't know their name...OH NO am I turned on by them? What does it mean?? And I'd try desperately to figure it out or prove to myself I was not attracted to them/did not want them/etc.

It really spiraled. I could barely look at others if I went out in public (skipped class a lot), eventually I stopped watching TV altogether too. In the end I couldn't bear to talk to my then partner since I felt too guilty to interact with him. I ended up on the verge of a breakdown. Therapy has helped. Also online resources about intrusive thoughts and appropriate ways to address them helped such as: acceptance, not giving them the power of acknowledging them as wrong/ threatening/ dangerous/ etc. - which makes them stronger because the brain is on high alert for those themes.

My point being... I think when we are experiencing normal things like noticing someone is attractive, interacting with someone in a friendly way, etc. Our brains can flag that as threatening (to us, our relationship, etc.) or potentially wrong even when it is perfectly normal and not actually a threat.

As humans we cannot control our thoughts like we can our actions, and our thoughts do not determine anything about us. Your thought of someone being attractive is absolutely normal. Your actions included interacting on a peer level (normal), and seeking out social support and interaction and feeling negatively when you did not receive it (normal).

Best wishes! Feel free to message me if you'd like to talk any time."
dankmemes,fp6w9gx,t3_gbh5j6,1588359683.0,"I totally agree, everyone seems to be a potential target for this type of thing regardless of gender. Making fun of people is wrong, even if it was about something that they could control. It's totally okay to have preferences - about boob sizes, dick sizes, body shapes/types, height, whatever. But there's no need to make fun of people or shame them because they are attracted to you and for whatever reason you are not attracted to them."
ROCD,forxe7i,t3_g9698f,1588020183.0,"Hey, it's okay. I'm sorry that you are struggling with this. I think part of the struggle is trying to prove something to yourself. It sounds like you did the mastubation in order to try and prove to yourself that it wasn't really a legitimate turn on for you. When I was experiencing the worst of this type of thing, I'd do all sorts of things to prove that things were not true to myself as well. Checking to see if I was turned on by certain thoughts was a part of it for me, too. I think just treating those thoughts and fears as part of the disorder, like any other thoughts and fears you have, could help you. What have you done for other thoughts, have you researched any techniques for dealing with the disorder? It may be helpful to do that. And if you happen to doubt yourself, like if your thoughts are truly intrusive and unwanted, just know it's okay and that if you wanted them it wouldn't bother you and wouldn't occupy so much energy or mind space (like it does). The thoughts are distressing because we don't want them, and the mind knows that and latches on and it's a viscious cycle. You're not bad, and it doesn't mean anything about you or your relationship. I'm not an expert, but I've done online research on these topics in order to address my own issues. Feel free to message me if you'd like. Best of luck!"

mentalillness,fo16y6v,t3_g52qj7,1587427004.0,"I have a good friend who had randomly ghost me as well. I talked to her about anything and everything, and always trusted her and loved having her in my life. Then about 3 years ago, I messaged her as usual and she just would never respond. I'd write apologies, and I did get an odd  ""it's fine"" followed by my trying to jump back in to talking like normal - but that didn't last long and eventually I just realized she was not going to respond. I mourned our friendship. I cried (a lot) and went through it over and over about how I must be to blame and how I'm unworthy of friendship and such. Then, about 2 years ago now she messaged me out of the blue with a detailed message where she apologized for ghosting me, said she missed me and often wanted to reach out (but was afraid of how I would respond), and explained that she had been cycling through depression medications without any luck and just could not handle social interactions with anyone (including me). I cried a lot when I got that message, I took a bit of time before responding to analyze my mixed feelings of anger/relief/happiness, but in the end I mostly expressed how I missed her too and even though her ghosting had hurt me a lot I was happy to hear from her. We made up, and we became friends again (the type that don't always talk but when we do it comes super naturally and feels really nice). It was very personally relieving to be able to go from ""it's all my fault I'm a terrible person who can't and shouldn't have friends"" to ""not everything is my fault and sometimes people are suffering in ways we can't know - and I'm not always to blame for everything negative intraction that happens with those I interact with"".

Even if that isn't the exact case with your friend, just know that you're not alone in that experience and there's a good chance it isn't your fault. It might take time to resolve, or at least accept and move on from.  Reaching out and being friendly is not a reason for someone to ghost you, it's possible that their own issues/feelings/reactions to the world are to blame."
depression,fnkhpc9,t3_g1wr6o,1587027466.0,"People in my life tend to be more understanding when they see me doing things they think I should be doing. Sometimes those things are good and reasonable - I have a therapist, I consulted a psychiatrist and take medications. Luckily I have been able to both pursue those things and afford them with insurance. I had to get to a breaking point before I pursued those things, and it was still very hard to do (make the appointment, get there, communicate my needs). Thinking of the many times I've spent in bed feeling like nothing was worthwhile, and having people around me expressing how I need to make plans for the future and take responsibility - I was just like yeah, no, I'm just trying to stay alive right now thank you anyways. When people aren't in that headspace (and especially if they never have been) I don't think they fully understand how much it affects you. It's easy to criticize someone for something you see them as choosing to do (such as being lazy), but harder to take the time to understand and sympathize with the reality of mental illness (not your choice to have).

It is not your fault you are depressed. It's okay that you're just surviving right now, that's a wonderful accomplishment. I hope you don't feel bad for feeling bad. As hard as it is and as much as I know I resisted, I'm very thankful I pursued help (therapy and medication)... I hope you can access whatever ends up being most helpful for you. Best wishes."

AskGayMen,f6cjeam,t3_dqyxfq,1572786128.0,"Hello, I'm a bisexual woman who has also had trouble accepting and embracing my sexuality. I am 21 and I've gone through denial since I was about 13. I've gone through this denial despite finding individuals of both genders attractive, and having various experiences with men and women. I have had long relationships with men exclusively, and I think this contributed to my repressing that part of my identity. I am newly single after a 3 year long relationship and I am working on re-establishing my identity outside of that relationship. Part of being single has involved being attracted to various other individuals - including women, which has lead to my acknowledging my sexuality once more. I just recently started to talk about my sexuality - just openly talk to my friends in public, using the word bisexual when asked, acknowledging my feelings towards men and women out loud to friends, and going to gay bars with friends who are also part of the community. For myself this difficulty accepting myself and being open about things that I find personal isn't exclusively about my sexuality, I'm very anxious and I don't want to be judged by others. Sexuality can be a very private experience, if no one before knew how you were feeling towards men I think it's understandable to be a little anxious about expressing that part of yourself to the world. I personally don't want to have to explain myself to anyone or defend my position when I'm still working on accepting myself. Maybe you're having trouble accepting yourself because of similar feelings? No matter how you choose to identify or the experiences you choose to pursue you are completely valid.

BPD,f2641zf,t3_dbzpdd,1569992638.0,"I crave this as well. I am a girl who is pursuing other girls, and a girl recently stayed the night and we kissed and she laid in my lap for a few hours. When she touched my face while kissing, let me stop a lot so we could smile at eachother, played with my hair, drew circles on my legs with her fingers while she laid in my lap... I was thinking ""Ah, yes, this is the part I love. This makes me feel safe, wanted, and good"". The most that happened was kissing and some upper body touching, but I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I'm worried because she's a friend who only wants FWB and seems to be more interested in other girls she's involved with, and doesn't seem to be as awed by the experience as I was. But I 100% know that I want that kind of affection in the future as well, so at least there's that once I get over the crushing pain of rejection that seems to be coming my way. I think it's easy to get emotionally attached to someone, especially when they give you that feeling - like everything is right in the world and you matter. I've had hookups with a few guys before where I had to ask to even cuddle after sex and it was awkward and unpleasant, I kept going for the attention but honestly it made me feel confused, empty, used, and pathetic. I was in a long term romantic relationship with a guy and the sexual interactions we had were much more enjoyable and meaningful to me than any of my hookups. I think it's important to know what you really want from a potential interaction, and it sounds like you do! In my opinion, from my experience, casual sex with strangers is not the same as an intimate experience with someone and is really not comparable at all in terms of the emotions associated with the interaction.

BPD,f25zi5i,t3_dc2z0s,1569988136.0,"Hello,

I have not yet been diagnosed, but I recently began seeking therapy for myself. If you are able to, I would research effective therapy for BPD. I have heard of DBT, talk therapy, etc. that are proven to be effective treatment options. If your therapist is only offering you religion as a treatment, and telling you basically to stop having your diagnosis, I don't understand how this is meant to help you (especially since you explained that you do not hold her same religious views). If she is helping, it is your decision to keep trying to better yourself with her help. If she is not helping, maybe it's time to consider seeking a new therapist? No one could decide that besides you, but you deserve to be heard and helped to the best extent of the resources available to you. 

Feel free to message me any time. I'm sorry it is hard right now, I'm wishing you the best of luck."
sex,f0gvkiz,t3_d4t08p,1568607118.0,"The best sex of my life was with the boy who was the ""smallest"" of my sexual partners. It killed me because he never believed me when I told him he was the best... and we used that position all the time. Missionary was good too. The only problem with the cowgirl position is that I didn't want to stop and l was in more control in that position - so make sure you use protection if you are worried about something like this (lack of self control).

He was very self conscious, but he was the best lover I have ever had - the only one who could give me an orgasm with proper foreplay and with PIV. There is not a single lover I would say was better than him, and in fact the others were at times *painful* and that's not enjoyable at all.

If you can, don't let your size determine your worth and confidence in your abilities. You can still rock a girl's world! If she's not open to trying then I'm sorry because she is missing out, but you deserve someone who won't write you off like that."

She assigned me the task of noting my emotions several times a day, including circumstances (like sleep, food, level of energy, level of motivation, etc.).

depression,ezz86kp,t3_d34dmv,1568282361.0,"Hey,

This sounds very stressful and hard for you right now. I'm sorry that is happening. It is okay to experiment and try and find outlets for energy/cope/figure out who you are and what you like to do - sometimes this includes minor experimentation with things, even drugs. This does not make you a bad person. Your parents might not be understanding about this, I hope they at least have your best interest at heart even though they're adding to your stress right now. I'm sorry about the girl, that sounds rough. I hope you can heal and find peace about that soon. 

It seems that these things have a good opportunity to get better with time (you might not experiment with any more drugs, your parents might not end up drug testing you, you may end up with someone lovely). I am wishing you the best during this stressful time"
self,ezz5z37,t3_d33zla,1568281198.0,"I agree with others, a good time is the time you personally feel ready. I hope you don't do it because your friends are. I hope you don't do it to try and impress or keep a dating partner. I hope when you do it that it is a beautiful and meaningful moment for you that you can cherish. 

Oftentimes I have thought about how beautiful it would have been to wait longer myself, and how much easier and more emotionally intimate my relationships could have been when I was younger if I had waited. My most recent partner showed me how meaningful it is, more than anyone else ever had, because his experiences were limited and all based in love. I was 19 when he taught me how meaningful it could and should feel to be with someone physically. 

At 15 I thought I was in love and I thought the guy would be my partner for longer than he was. My advice is to test that - it's okay to wait a while in a relationship. Really, don't feel pressured to begin a physical relationship within a certain time frame after the emotional relationship begins - just choose whenever you truly feel the stability and love you deserve to feel when you make a decision like that. I believe that it can change the dynamics of the relationship, so try and choose a time when you feel emotionally ready to handle that with your partner.

Good luck to you! I hope whenever and however it happens is enjoyable for you and your partner. 😊"

I don't know if it would be appropriate for me to share with you my view of the situation, but I'm hoping it might help just a little... The girl who used the soap dispenser after you did so understanding that people had touched it before her. It is not your fault or responsibility for touching it before she did (if it wasn't you, it would have been someone else who touched it last). It is her decision how to wash her hands (how long, how thoroughly). It is not your fault that the situation happened, because soap dispensers in bathrooms require the person to touch them and then the expectation is a proper hand washing. It is not your responsibility that she failed to follow through with her part of this process.

BPD,ezjliqw,t1_ezjfmtf,1567946488.0,"Hello! I appreciate the contribution. I should clarify that, of course, I'm not a professional. The information I have, I assume, is somewhat similar to the information others have access to. I am thinking that there is probably some disagreement in the field over things like this, and I tried to convey in my comment that this is the case. I didn't mean to imply that a professional would purposefully not diagnose someone out of spite or lack of care - simply that people can be diagnosed wrong, even as adults, but this can happen with any disorder you could ever be diagnosed with. I was emphasizing that a person might want to keep an open mind if they disagree with their therapist - because they're all human and they might be wrong. In my personal case I'm questioning the opinion of my therapist from when I was younger, this is just my experience and I am in no way trying to imply that if the OP is not diagnosed with BPD that their therapist is wrong. Just that it's okay to ask questions and explore what you think is going on - and if you don't feel heard or understood it's okay to get another opinion (not just to leave and reject treatment if someone doesn't get the diagnosis that they think they might have).

I have encountered information that it is diagnosable in people under 18, but that it is generally avoided (for a variety of reasons). One source that I believe I had knowledge of when I was writing my comment, and that I also re-visited after reading your reply, was this one: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3811088/

I appreciate your clarifying that you are not trying to be critical, truly. I am a sensitive person and I do take things very personally even when they are objectively neutral things. I love being able to have a discussion over these things! I am in no way an expert on this, and I would love to know if you have any sources that you know of that I could check out for my own knowledge? I know the DSM changes often, and that things are progressing all of the time even outside of that, so I don't know if my information is the most up to date or not.

Thank you so much for the respectful conversation :) I look forward to hearing from you again"
BPD,ezjag3l,t3_d18bck,1567941437.0,"Hello,

Just for a little information: I am 21 and I do not have a formal diagnosis yet, but I'm meeting with a therapist later this week to see if she can help me understand and/or confirm what I think is going on so I can start to treat it. I do have two diagnoses of depression and anxiety.

When I was your age I had a lot of life factors going on, a lot of questioning who I was and feeling like I never had enough support, love, or validation. I couldn't understand how to relate to other people. In 5th or 6th grade I remember not getting alone with my peers and having everyone think that I just was so full of myself because I was always so guarded and untrusting. I came off as angry and arrogant and uncaring - but really I had so much pain and fear of rejection inside of myself that just kept building and building until I was forced to see a therapist. By this time I was cutting myself (it started when I realized that was a part of the ""emo"" identity so I thought I should do that, then it evolved into something I did to feel something, and it was partly something I did to be able to express myself in some way and release some emotions). I was screaming and crying all of the time and trying to convey what I needed (love, validation, attention, support) and reacting when anything hurt my feelings (very often) and no one wanted to hear me. It was very intense. I was diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder. I don't remember my therapy at all except that I didn't like talking with him (and he continually told me the sooner the aggressive behavior stopped the sooner I could stop going to therapy), and that he experienced trouble diagnosing me. I personally left therapy and I think I learned to internalize those things instead. I have a feeling I may have been misdiagnosed then, but I'm not sure.

I believe that you *can* be diagnosed with BPD as an adolescent with one continuous year of symptoms (and if they are obviously not related to normal age related hormonal changes). However, I believe that therapists do not like to do this because of stigma, and if they're uncertain they wouldn't take it lightly to diagnose you with a personality disorder (an ongoing pattern of behavior).

I definitely think you should consult a professional. Sometimes therapists can be wrong, and you may need to see a few before you find one you trust. If you feel understood and validated and safe in your therapy relationship then I would really be open to listening to their opinion :) Even if you do not end up having what you think you do have, your experiences are all valid and I'm so happy that you recognize that you're going through something and you want to feel better. Best of luck to you! I'm always here if you want to talk 💛"
BPD,ezj5qf3,t3_d17wdo,1567939052.0,"Hello,

You are not crazy. I hope that you are able to be compassionate towards yourself in this time. Just so you know where I'm coming from, I do not have a diagnosis at this time but I have a new therapist set up for this week. Sometimes the feelings that are experienced and the things that make sense to one person are not something that other people are able to understand - but that does not make them invalid.

Personally, sometimes I feel like I'm watching my life go by and I'm watching myself mess up and I just can't stop it, things slip through my fingers and I can't keep ahold of them. It's terrible to feel out of control... I'm hoping my new therapist will be able to help me gain some sense of control in my life and find a way to stop ruining and losing everything. Do you see a therapist?

Do you think that you'd lie and say you were not feeling suicidal?

I am not an expert, these are just my opinions so please know that. Maybe the ER is not the best answer, unless you feel you are an immediate risk to yourself of course. If you are able to find comfort and de-escalate in a way that allows you to keep the most control and autonomy as possible then that might be a better choice. In my opinion, in times of intense emotions, it is okay to self harm (in a way that does not increase your risk of accidental suicide), it is okay to listen to SUPER loud music through headphones or speakers, to throw stuff across the room, etc. It's okay to express your emotions in whatever way is most constructive and does not threaten the safety/life of yourself or others. If we don't have a better way to cope then I think we just do whatever we can and that is totally okay. We are all working on trying to find the best ways to feel better and no one is perfect and that is okay too. I personally think the ER becomes the answer when you feel that you are unable to resist the urge of suicide in any other way."

BPD,ezhb5xa,t3_d14b3h,1567908021.0,"Hi,

I am so incredibly sorry that this is happening to you right now. It sounds so incredibly painful and difficult. Do you have any strategies that have worked for you in the past? When I felt my worst I also self harmed and I reached out to people on the internet and that was what helped me pull through those worst times. I'm really glad that you are reaching out - if you do feel the need to reach out to a hospital I would encourage you to do so. In my experience it can feel so much like all the air has been sucked out of your life and all you can do is desperately scramble around and beg people to give you something to get you by - but they never give you what you need and don't seem to understand how much you're struggling to continue breathing. I can say that in those moments, sometimes that overwhelming feeling of suffocation and lack of any support can be a deception of your mind and emotions. If you can pull through the worst of it you will be all the stronger for it - and trust me, it's amazing how I can still look back at my 14 year old self who wanted to kill myself because no one was there for me, no one loved me enough, bullying left me feeling broken, father wasn't in my life at that point after verbally abusive past, felt such low self esteem, I had zero feeling of control over my life, etc.... I wanted to scream out to people with my actions ""Can't you see how much I need you?! Look at how horribly you are failing me!!!!""
I got counseling instead, and I think I learned to internalize some of those negative emotions. I did leave the therapy without being suicidal any more though. Now at 21 I am ready to confront my baggage and attend therapy in a meaningful way because I want to feel better and be able to experience life and function in a healthier way. I am in such a better place than I was then, but I can still tap into that desperation and I know how real and horrible those feelings are. You are not alone, if nothing else we are all here for you. Please hold onto our hands, we all believe in you. If you think venting would help I will be available to chat any time."
BPD,ezh4qef,t3_d13l6h,1567905535.0,"Hi,

I am sorry that I can't be there for you in a more meaningful way right now. You say in your post that you need help - please, try and get it. In the midst of my suicidal thoughts I sought help for my depression. Antidepressants helped me a lot, it took maybe a month to be fully effective but after that my mind cleared up a lot and I no longer felt like I needed to die. I have been able to feel other emotions instead: joy, hope, happiness, love and friendship. I have had more energy, less of an appetite, I've been able to think more clearly. There are better emotions, better things, more energy, more inspiring and deeply moving experiences - and they're all possible for you.

I hope you are able to muster up that little bit of strength you still have and get yourself the help that will reward you with so much more strength and positivity. I cried on the bus ride to my doctor. I cried in the waiting room. I cried in the bathroom of the office. I cried in the Crisis Counselor's office (therapist you get into quickly because the office determines that you are in a crisis). I cried on the bus ride back home. It was horrible and overwhelming in that moment, but it was worth it because ever since then I have felt so much more free from the life-sucking negativity that once had control over me. I'm signed up to go to therapy to hopefully unpack my past that still haunts me as well and address how it is impacting me still and how I can improve my life even further.

Please remember that you - the you that can hope and dream and feel pleasant emotions - are still in there, maybe way deep down under all the pain, but you are there. You are worth fighting for, and that last little bit of energy that you have can be enough to start the process that will pull you out of that suffering. I wish you nothing but the best."
OCD,ezfqv1m,t1_ezei8jd,1567881973.0,"Hey, I'm sorry to hear that you're going through that. I understand the hesitation and being scared that they won't believe you or won't think there's a legitimate cause (for me this circles back to the thought/fear of just being a horrible person). I don't fully understand all of the diagnostic criteria for OCD, but I believe that the obsessions and/or compulsions don't have to circle around cleanliness. Additionally, I believe these can manifest in many different ways, sometimes purely mentally (a compulsion doesn't have to be physical). I am not a professional, but I have done some research into my experiences to try and understand them better - which means that may be inaccurate, I just felt I should share that with you.

Someone told me that it doesn't matter what I get diagnosed with - I'm in distress and I am having the feelings and symptoms that I have. I am working on accepting that it's okay if I don't get diagnosed with what I go in feeling like I have. I feel like I might have OCD, and maybe BPD, but the reason I feel this way is my experiences (and those don't change with or without a particular diagnosis being given to me by the therapist I go to see). You are valid and it's okay if you are not diagnosed how you think you will be, we are all just trying to understand ourselves and feel better. Thank you for the nice wishes! I hope you also get the help that you need :)"
OCD,ezdt2c1,t3_d0u6gw,1567854685.0,"Hi there,

I don't have an official diagnosis, but I've been plagued by intrusive thoughts. Horrible, the most evil, the worst, the things that make you doubt that you are, or ever were, a good person. I have heard that they mean so much to us because they attack our sense of values and go against what we truly believe and feel - so we cannot let them go and they become more and more powerful for this reason, because our brain labels them as important, and they come up more and more.

I have a lot of concerns regarding my relationship. I always worry that my partner will leave and that I will be the cause, or that they will find someone better. During my worst time I could not leave my house for fear of looking up and making eye contact with someone and accidentally judging them in any way, I could not watch TV (including kids on tv or children's cartoons) because literally every single thing that I saw triggered this intense spiral of ""oh no, did I look at them wrong?? Did I interpret that situation weirdly???? Oh no I'm evil I should kill myself I don't deserve to be alive, I don't deserve my relationship"" and cue the thoughts of ways to kill myself playing over and over again in my head and I felt it took everything possible to resist either killing myself or ending my relationship and avoiding everyone and everything since I was such a worthless person. When I started treating my depression with medications (Welbutrin) a lot of this got better. 

However, it's not all better by any means. My most bothersome issue is the ""oh no what if I looked at that person wrong and liked them or want to be with them"" and then that leading to ""I don't deserve to be in a relationship"" etc. combined with my messed up feelings when anyone is nice to me my brain says ""maybe you like them"" ""you could be in a relationship with them"" ""what if you really do like them?"" ""you don't deserve a relationship"". I have to keep looking at the person to determine over and over that I'm not attracted to them and then looking away (then cue the ""but what if you are though?!"" and I have to look again, but also I feel the need to avoid looking at them to avoid bringing up the feeling that it's a possibility at all.) I'll continue to worry about this afterwards and try to analyze it all.

I don't know exactly what my experiences can be classified as, but I remember the worst moments when it seemed like every single thing attacked me mentally. I avoided animals (including my dog), other people, family, children, potentially dangerous objects or situations (knives, being too close to windows for fear of giving in and jumping, I stood as far from the edge as possible at the bus station because I felt like I should/would jump in front of the bus), etc. It was really difficult to be a person. It seemed like absolutely everything no matter how objectively neutral made me question myself - my dog being sweet to me and laying on his back (me just imagining how I could hurt him since he is so vulnerable and trusts me so much and hating myself for it (and maybe I want to?!)), my friend's baby just existing in the same room as me just being a baby (my mind telling me maybe I don't deserve friends or babies ever because what if I was somehow inappropriately looking at them or something (and what if I wanted to?!)).

I think that our minds go to great lengths to convince us that these thoughts are true and extremely threatening. But in reality you probably hold it very dear to yourself not to harm animals in any way. You probably hold it very dearly to love and support your dog as a good pet owner. 

I am sorry that you are hurting so much right now. It sounds like maybe you are in a place where it's hard to know what's really going on and what is attributable to OCD.

I'm going to a therapist next week to talk about these things with a professional for the first time. I hope that you can get some help as well. The biggest thing that has helped me so far (besides the antidepressants) was looking up intrusive thoughts and trying to accept that they held no meaning in reality. A lot of the ""themes"" of my thoughts came up, and that was so reassuring to me that I'm not somehow just an evil outcast. I think therapy takes this concept to the next level. I hope I have been able to be helpful to you in some way! I know reading your post was helpful to me, whenever I learn about anyone else having thoughts and/or fears that they are also embarrassed or ashamed about I feel a little bit less evil and a little bit more able to be forgiving towards myself. I hope you feel this way as well.

Good luck to you! Feel free to message me any time. You are not a bad person 💛"
BPD,ezaugfg,t3_d0lxee,1567807738.0,"Hi,

I do not have an official diagnosis, but I have experience with this as well. I had a relationship in my young teenage years from ages 14 to 16 (21 now) and the way he handled it was to leave as well. It was very horrible for me and at the time it just tore me apart. Fast forward to today and I've had instances in my most recent relationship where I was so upset and had no way to deal with my emotions in a healthy way other than to leave. It actually hurt my partner, too. I know it hurts a lot. I think if anything, de-escalating the situation will be your best bet. When it gets too hard for one partner to handle and their most drastic coping mechanism is triggered, such as escaping because they can't deal with it at that time, it just makes sense for them to respond like that. Maybe you can have a conversation with him to communicate to you when he needs to have a break in the argument before it reaches the point he feels he has to leave the conversation entirely (like a safe phrase ""can we please talk about this later,"" or ""I'm sorry but I can't talk about this right now,"" etc.)? Best of luck to you!"

I'm sorry that you're going through this. Just so you know where I am coming from, I do not have an official diagnosis. I think guilt is a really hard emotion - at least for me. I also don't know what is important and needs to be shared and what can just exist in the past or in my mind. I get guilty for a whole lot of reasons and I always have since I was a kid, and always thought something bad would happen if I didn't clear the guilt and tell the person whatever I thought I needed to confess about or something, or that I didn't deserve something nice that they might do unless they could accept the thing I was feeling guilty about. I think emotions are complex and sometimes the way we worry about them means more than they do on their own (and they turn into this awful giant emotion we feel we must share - to be accepted, to deserve what the other is giving us, whatever it might be for you). I unfortunately don't know what to do with this, but I wanted to let you know you're not alone with this type of concern. I'm seeking therapy myself. Best of luck to you, truly!! You are not a bad or undeserving person."
ROCD,ez5h4ht,t3_d00dog,1567699401.0,"Hi,
I am sorry that you're feeling this way! I agree with the other poster that we cannot tell you if he is lying or not. However, something that I've heard from people is not to make decisions in a moment of intense emotions (especially if you are unsure of their validity or basis in reality) but rather to have clarity on the situation when deciding things. I personally have a hard time with this because I feel like my intuition is defective - otherwise I would have died a lot of times already, everyone would truly hate me all the time, etc. etc. I just think it's important to get to a place where you can be calm and identify what you think the truth of the situation is so you can respond in a way that feels genuine, and that you will not regret upon reflection. Easier said than done, but I'm wishing you luck! Remember that there is no time sensitivity really, take your time to be comfortable with your interpretations and the decisions based on them. :)"

I hope that you can successfully get set up with someone in person! If you feel like you aren't getting what you need I agree that you should pursue something more helpful, and you even know what you need to look for :) I think it's a fantastic thing that you recognize that there is more that needs to be dealt with before you can truly feel your best. It sounds like you might be feeling afraid to confront those deepest feelings that you have not previously worked through? I currently am feeling that - I know exactly the very deep feelings/behaviors that I am terrified about addressing will be exactly what I need to address to feel better.

I don't think addressing the hardest things would be bad or a waste of time because the work you are putting in is towards feeling better, and feeling better will probably eventually include addressing those deepest, most painful feelings.

If you ever feel like chatting about anything feel free to message me! Thank you for your nice wishes. :)"
depression,eyxxnr0,t3_czdw8d,1567565235.0,"Hello,

You matter and you are important. I hope you can manage to pull through just one day at a time. It's okay to not know if the next day will feel worth it to endure, but I sincerely hope that it will.

If you can reach out in a time of great distress, I hope that you will. (call the suicide hotline at 1-800-273-8255) (text ""HOME"" to 741741 in the USA, ""HOME"" to 686868 in Canada)

Please know that there are many people who care and want you to feel as little distress as possible. 💛"
BPD,eyxr1lf,t3_czayy1,1567560370.0,"Hi,

I am so sorry to hear that you are going through this right now.

Every time I've gotten into a relationship I've felt I wasn't worth it, wasn't good enough, and that they'd leave me (but also soon started to fantasize about a future with them, which I then desperately cling to and worry about losing), like I will ruin them as a person, I will ruin the relationship, I will be the reason for suffering. I think it is a manifestation of my fears, but in my brain they attack me.

I just scheduled my first therapy appointment as an adult today, after months of putting it off for fear of rejection and judgement by the therapist. I am now beyond ecstatic. I don't want to feel like crap all the time, and I bet you don't want that either. It is hard to change, but it sounds like you're ready for a change too. Do you have access to therapy? From my research it seems like it can be very helpful for people who are suffering in this way.

When people have issues that are untreated it can be very tough. My boyfriend is depressed, somewhat high functioning but I know how deep his pain is when he's alone and not hiding it. He does not treat it and I feel incapable of making it better (but like I should be able to). I have issues of my own that I have only slowly begun addressing, starting with medication for depression, many months later medication for anxiety, and soon therapy. I think we all need to care for ourselves and our mental health, it is very important because the suffering is real and significant. If your behaviors, thoughts, or feelings are causing you distress and/or disrupting your life and causing it not to be how you want it to, then it may be time to address what is going on. It can feel like accepting there may be an issue outside of you just being a bad person in some way can feel like an escape or excuse, but it isn't. It's strong because it is really hard to view the situation as more than a deep internal fault within ourselves.

Speaking for myself, my thoughts push my self worth onto the ground and pin me there so I constantly feel like the worst person ever. The thoughts that tell you you're not good enough, that you're abusive, that you're a burden, that no one wants to be there, that you don't belong anywhere -- those are all part of this experience, not a true reflection of you. 

There can be many variations and this won't look the same for everyone. I believe you identified a few that exemplify how you are feeling. Please tell me if I am mistaken, but those terrible thoughts and/or experiences seem to manifest for you as:

""He is better off without me""
'he knows he is better off without me but won't admit it'
'He is only with me so I don't kill myself'
'I am abusive and garbage towards him'
'I am a monster'
'I won't/can't change'
'I am not worth the energy it takes for someone to care about me'
'I feel numb and use any method available to feel something, anything'
'I am having trouble recognizing real feelings'
'I feel like I need to be alone, do not want others near me, do not have the energy to be in anyone else's life'
'I feel like a burden to my husband who is overwhelmed by his own burdens as well'
'He is the responsible and necessary part of this family, parenting relationship, and romantic relationship -- I am just an added responsibility in these situations'
'My husband is in agony yet I am causing him more pain by feeling this way'
'I do not want to hurt any one. I feel the need to protect him, and everyone, from me and my ability to hurt them. I want him to realize that I am not good enough to be with him (thereby validating my feelings of inadequacy that I truly believe)'

...Those are painful thoughts. I feel so sad that you are feeling this way. The fact that you worry about hurting people can hopefully bring you some comfort because it shows that you deeply and truly care about the people around you. Similarly to intrusive thoughts (thoughts we don't want but they attack our deepest held beliefs and values and create anxiety about their potential truth), I believe these painful thoughts attack us because we are afraid. We desperately want to shield those around us from the pain that we feel we will/do/can inflict onto them. It's a very distressing feeling, wanting to be loved and feeling unworthy of it. I want you to know that these thoughts and feelings don't make you a bad person, and that you are as valid and worthy as everyone else to experience and enjoy the good things in this world  💛

I apologize if any of this is inaccurate, or hurtful in any way. I just wanted you to know that you're not alone, and I was hoping to be able to reflect back to you as an outside observer what I thought you were saying and the emotions that seemed to be present. I wish nothing but the best for you."
BPD,eyv59ia,t3_cywu1x,1567481065.0,"Hello!

I am happy to be here if you ever want to talk. I am not really qualified to be able to offer you anything other than a safe place to vent to if you want.

You ask at the end what is wrong? Have you been treated in a substantial way for your diagnosis and set up therapy for your BPD? Have you researched it? I think knowing what you're up against is great, but from my understanding you benefit most from treating it in an effective way that involves therapy (such as DBT). From my understanding you are doing better on medications but there remains some troublesome feelings and symptoms? I want you to know your feelings are valid, but not necessarily true (for instance you're not a bad person, but you may be struggling with your mental illness).

I hope someone else can be more helpful for you, but just know you're not alone and you're not a bad person. I sincerely hope to hear from you if you ever would like to vent one on one."
BPD,eyv43vb,t3_cyxbt0,1567480072.0,"Hey, I really hope you don't die. You have value and worth and despite how it feels right now, there are people who care about you. Maybe they don't know how you need them to care, maybe they're not there how they need to be, but they do care.

Suicide won't make people be there for you, it won't make you feel better or effectively communicate how much you need support right now. It feels like it will, and personally I know I've been desperate and feeling the same suicidal way. I wanted to show them - I NEED you, I need you so bad I can't live right now, and you aren't here but I need you to be!!! Like I just wanted to cry and scream that at everyone who I needed. But if I had gone through with it there would be no way to save me, no way for them to be there for me at all.

That feeling will pass, and you will be able to consider other ways to get that support that is so desperately needed but that isn't there at this moment. I am SO sorry that you are feeling this - it is literally the worst, most desperate feeling.

If you want to talk person to person please message me. I will listen all night to the distress what has led up to this moment if you feel like venting will help you.

If you want to talk to a professional, there are people who can be there for you right now in ways us redditors cannot be. (text ""HOME"" to 741741)(call 1-800-273-8255)"
BPD,eytqqlg,t1_eytpxl3,1567443363.0,"Thank you. I think I get what you mean, that my intense anxiety and percieved threat might not match up with the reality of how much my partner likes and/or cares about how the random person looks ? Lol yeah, that's my go-to strategy as well."
Anxiety,eytplvj,t3_cyp5c3,1567442575.0,"Hello, I'm sorry to hear that this is happening to you. I know in my relationship there was a time where I needed to avoid a conversation to avoid having a literal breakdown, and it was really tough for my boyfriend. This was during a time I was deep in depression and anxiety and felt I couldn't handle any of my problems and kept thinking of suicide (I did not share this with him or anyone). He waited patiently, longer than I think should be expected, but it took me a long time to feel like having that conversation would not kill me. I think that for someone who doesn't understand how close you might be to the edge of feeling out of control and unable to cope it can be difficult. If I wanted to talk about something and was constantly told the other person 'couldn't', I would be upset too. I think normally this resolves relatively quickly. I think it would be helpful if you can ensure that your boyfriend has a true understanding of what you are going through. It you can explain to him that you are not dismissing his feelings and you do deeply care about him even when you cannot handle the conversation it will be a validation for him - his feelings are valid, you do understand that they are important and need to be addressed. I have a friend with a husband with a history of trauma, and the way she approaches disagreements is different than how someone normally might. If you attack someone who is unable to mentally cope with it no one will benefit. She approaches him, states the issue, then tells him to come to her when he feels ready to talk (could be a few days to a week), then repeats this as necessary after that time. She says it can be frustrating for her, but if she does not respect his mental state and ability to discuss something then it only results in a situation where you are trying to force someone to understand you while they are mentally shutting down and incapable of doing so.

I hope that you both come to a place of greater understanding, I think you can, especially if you both put in continuous effort to validate and respect eachother. Best of luck to you!!"
BPDmemes,eyswyir,t1_euzct0x,1567415322.0,I think you will if you try again now 👍
Anxiety,eysoj64,t3_cyk824,1567406060.0,"I have this experience as well. I get really caught up in this too, but usually I try and block it out. I have weird things though, I feel like if I know someone is going to be driving somewhere and I do not tell them to drive safely that they will get in a serious accident. I know this isn't logical, but yet it is a feeling I get. Also feel like the timing for when I leave the house is very important and if I time it wrong in any way that I will die. But I don't know the right timing, which is very stressful. I did have a traumatic, accidental death in the family when I was 15 so I think this has something to do with at least the last one. I'm working on getting established with a therapist and plan on asking about it all. If you aren't satisfied with your therapists analysis and interpretation then it might be a good idea to consult another therapist or explicitly express your disagreement and concern and ask them to consider what you think might be going on. For example, if you thought it might be something such as intrusive thoughts and compulsions, as seen in OCD, you could mention that to them and get their feedback. I am seeking therapy at this time and I check to see that they can treat and identify the things that i think i have going on. No you can't diagnose yourself, but it seems helpful to have someone with specific knowledge to at least help rule things out.

Feel free to message if you ever feel like chatting! Best of luck to you :)"
depressionregimens,eyrycxj,t1_eyr6xmm,1567381818.0,"I wanted to comment on this as well. I am personally on Welbutrin (have been for about 10 months), and while it has helped tremendously for the depression it has only helped some parts of the anxiety. My doctor said it may help parts of depression that are also linked to anxiety, and that sometimes once the depression fades away you're left feeling the anxiety that still remains to be treated. Basically it doesn't treat anxiety but it can sometimes make it better, or on the flip side reveal how bad it is. I just recently started on some BuSpar for the daily anxiety, and got Clonazepam for the really bad flares."

BPD,eygvx9q,t1_eygs7cs,1567077580.0,"Have you tried created a list and/or monthly budget? This may help you regulate your spending a little bit and reduce some of the stress related to the budget. :)

Are you able to go back to counseling and/or talk with a doctor about possible medications you could try? If you know what hasn't worked for you in the past at least you have a head start in finding the right medication this time around. Medications can be really helpful if you are able to find the right one. I do think that some medications can cause side effects, issues when doses are missed, or problems if they are discontinued suddenly. Your doctor/pharmacist would be able to tell you factual information that is accurate for whatever medications you were/are on. Hopefully you can work with your doctor to find a medication that has minimal side effects, addresses your concerns, and that works with your schedule (i.e. a medication that can be taken once a day versus multiple times).

I'm hoping you feel better soon:)"
BPD,eygmbll,t1_eygkgxo,1567072539.0,"Thank you so much for all of your input, it's been really helpful. :) I'm feeling a bit less hesitant about scheduling something now. It is encouraging knowing that I could go in and have someone help me figure out what's going on while also going at my pace, as opposed to being asked hurtful questions and forced to discuss topics that are too difficult for me at the time. The test sounds intimidating, but at least I can try and mentally prepare for something like that taking place. Thanks again!"
BPD,eyghftv,t1_eygg53n,1567069662.0,"I'm really glad that she worked out for you since you didn't have many options.

Could you tell me more about the test? When you went to her did you tell her what you thought you might be experiencing and then she gave you a test relevant to that? Like, if I went in should I say ""I feel like maybe I have X, Y, and Z."" Or was it more like she interviewed you about symptoms and then decided which test to give you? Or was it a test that seemed relevant for many things?

When I was diagnosed with the depression and anxiety the person I saw a few times was a Crisis Counselor (social worker, not technically a therapist I don't think). She was so blunt and I ended up crying a lot and feeling attacked during the appointments. I'm worried because if someone else asks me direct questions like ""Are you worried about [exact thing you're obsessing over constantly and afraid of]?"" I will just break down. It sounds like maybe I should expect that type of directness from them, and I guess maybe just get more comfortable addressing those issues over time?"

How many did you personally have to try before you decided on the one that was right for you? Do you have any tips on how to make the first appointment count towards seeing if you're compatible?"
BPD,eygd9zh,t1_eygb3u7,1567067120.0,"I also self harmed around that age and felt I was not getting the support, attention, and love that I needed. At the time they diagnosed me with Oppositional Defiance Disorder and the therapist basically taught me how to internalize those feelings I think (I cannot remember the process). I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for the past 10 months. The last 6 weeks my relationship has been in question and it is killing me. I've experienced a lot of time for reflection and I think I'm going through more than anxiety and depression. I think maybe OCD/ROCD, and maybe BPD. But the potential to go in and talk to someone about all the crap I go through, all the horrible thoughts (intrusive thoughts), worrying about my relationship, feeling a need and lack of control, questioning myself and my feelings, being terrified of my bf meeting someone better, and constantly from the beginning feeling I didn't deserve to be with him, etc. will be greeted with ""Oh, no, you're just a terrible person who wants to think about awful things and who is emotionally abusive and controlling"".

Almost 10 months ago the intrusive thoughts and constant worry about the relationship really kicked in and tortured me when I had a health scare. I was considering suicide because I felt I wasn't worthy to be with my bf (in large part due to the intrusive thoughts and anxiety that plagued me). Those unwanted thoughts led me to believe I was a terrible person that shouldn't exist and that I definitely didn't deserve to be with my bf. I considered breaking up because I couldn't handle the guilt or suicide because I was so awful. At the same time I didn't feel he was being as emotionally supportive as I needed him to be, which was very distressing. When I started treating the depression a lot of the intrusive  thoughts got better, or easier to ignore I guess. However the thoughts and worries concerning my relationship persist and really break me down.

Part of the reason that I am considering therapy now is that my current relationship is barely even existing and I'm losing hope of it working out. If I can get a diagnosis and then manage the turmoil inside of myself then I have this feeling that maybe he will accept me. Maybe he will give me forgiveness and understanding. Maybe he will accept me and give me love in spite of it. I'm terrified because without any diagnosis of something that would cause intrusive thoughts or the intolerable anxiety and jealously I feel he will just pass me off as a crazy ex and realize he deserves someone so much better. We've been together almost two and a half years at this point. It's been hard sometimes but I don't want it to end, he's been the best to me out of any of my boyfriends and he means a lot to me. 

So the lack of a diagnosis is terrifying, and getting a diagnosis sounds terrifying. I search and search for therapists and can't decide who looks like the best, and I'm so scared to schedule something and be judged. I used to rely on my bf for emotional support and encouragement and now I'm struggling to do anything that is anxiety inducing. I want to know how to better deal with all this chaos, but it's terrifying."
BPD,eyg55sh,t3_cwn540,1567061688.0,"During a time I didn't feel I could leave my house I ordered food to be delivered. It's kind of expensive that way and the services aren't always available, but maybe there's a drive through restaurant near you? Then you'd never have to leave the car. Maybe one day instead of going through the drive through you can take yourself to a small market and shop for just enough to get by for that day (so you're in and out quickly)? Keep your head up, I know it sucks really really bad when you feel that way.

I was lucky to be able to get on medication for my depression (Welbutrin specifically) and that helped a lot with my suicidal thoughts. Besides medication it also helped me when I was able to let those intrusive thoughts exist but not focus on them (hard to do I know).

Best of luck to you!"
BPD,eyaxqkf,t3_cw1vjr,1566971883.0,"I am not officially diagnosed with BPD at the moment though I am strongly suspicious that it is an issue for me. One of the reasons that I feel this way is that my reasoning behind things has often revolved around feelings of abandonment, lack of love and support, and fear to lose anyone I like in any way at all or that they won't find me as special to them as I find them to me.

When I used to cut in middle school I was in a place of absolute frustration. My family was at a loss for how to help me and be there for me, and honestly they were probably just overwhelmed because of everything that was going on. I spent a lot of time alone. No one ever supported me in a way towards a hobby or spending time together, basically I was expected to magically come home and do homework after feeling like crap all day at school. I had a lot of issues in school as well. I felt worthless. I didn't eat the lunches my mother did lovingly pack me because I was anxious when people saw me eating and I was so ashamed because of my body image (I have always been heavier even as a child). I could not accept the loving gestures that were given to me and I just absolutely freaked out in the absence of the care and support I felt that I needed but could never receive enough of. Kids at school were horrible. My father was verbally abusive to my mother (and sometimes to me) and so home life sucked. I fell into some things online where older people took advantage of me as a child (~11 y.o.)  without reasoning ability and an insatiable desire to be loved and desired and valued. My life was in a tailspin. I was angry with the world, angry no one loved me and supported me enough, I needed them to see how much I truly needed them. When my mother did find out about the cutting she took me to therapy, forced me even though I didn't want that. I wanted attention and love not to be forced to talk to some guy I hated. He diagnosed me with Oppositional Defiance Disorder, which he told me was for insurance purposes but that my family insists that I have to this day for some reason. I was in pain, I didn't want to hurt people, but lashing out was only reaction that I could do. Flash forward and I'm pretty sure it all comes down to something closer to BPD. I still struggle with those feelings of insatiable desire for closeness with others and worrying I will lose them and/or not be as important to them as they are to me. I suppose as a child I only knew how to deal with this physically and with anger and aggression towards myself. I guess therapy helped me internalize those feelings and reactions, but now I'm depressed and anxious.

Can you relate to this? I'm sorry if it isn't appropriate to put all this on your thread, if you ask me to move it I have no problem doing so. I do hope to talk more to you about this subject (and any others)!"

Even though your extra ingredient wasn't a favorite of everyone, I think what makes a difference is that you didn't purposefully make dinner only to please yourself. I think the act still stands as a nice and considerate thing for you to do, especially since you sincerely thought everyone would enjoy it. It takes so much effort and thought to try and plan and do things for others, and that's what you were trying to do. It's unfortunate that it didn't work out how you wanted it to, but food can be tricky and that isn't all your fault.

OCD,eya04fs,t3_cvy7hz,1566956039.0,"Hello! If your school has an accessibility/disability center they *may* be able to help you (I'm not sure). It sounds like you're trying hard to help yourself. Maybe it's time to try a different approach, a different therapist?

Personally, talking with instructors generally has been a very helpful thing for me to do in the past. People generally will want to help you, especially since it sounds like you put in obvious effort into these classes. Instructors recognize that kind of stuff, and it sounds like they didn't expect your results to be how they were either. I dont think a struggle with mental health is an excuse, it is debilitating... Some features of a mental health disorder include that it effects important parts of our lives (like work, school, etc.), and it is personally distressing. These things can mean that it is harder for us to be successful in our coping and we will handle things differently than other people. Your deafening intrusive thoughts, the constant inability to focus during the exam, the experiences of unreality, and the physical symptoms of unease (nausea, scratching, etc.) are very real things. And these very real things are not so helpful when you are expected to focus and be able to produce the knowledge that you DO have and show how hard you HAVE worked the entire course. If you threw anyone else into that exam hall feeling the way you were, would you expect them to be successful? There's nothing to doubt or feel ashamed of, it was not a good situation but truly you did your best to continue on in spite of your struggles.

About your ""friend,"" it is so hard when a friendship disintegrates after we let people in and share our time, resources, care, and secrets with them. It sounds like he betrayed your trust and friendship and I hope that he grasps the severity of the distress that he caused you. It is easy to hurt someone if we know what hurts them the most, and on the flip side we have a reasonable expectation that they would avoid doing so since they know how *not* to hurt you. I hope if the friendship is important to you, and you'd like it to continue, that he might take responsibility and initiate an attempt to heal the friendship.

I hope you can work something out regarding your exams! It isn't right that you didn't get the chance to effectively share what you have worked so hard for this entire time. Best of luck!"
depression,ey7sqpd,t1_ey7sk3r,1566898799.0,"Thank you for explaining where you were coming from, I misunderstood. I agree that suicide is not a joke and should not be used to get attention if the person is not honestly struggling with it.

I'm not sure what the person really is experiencing, but hopefully if they truly are struggling they will get help. (I'm sure we would all want this for them!)"
depression,ey7scn8,t1_ey7p40b,1566898233.0,"Isn't every suicide attempt a desperate attempt to try and stop the pain and distress someone is experiencing? There are other ways to do that and they can result in genuine enjoyment of life again. When people survive I hear they often regret trying to end it because they don't truly want to die they want to feel better.

If this person is experiencing some form of subconscious restraint and it is the reason that they have been unsuccessful in the past, good for them. I'm happy for everyone who does not succeed with their attempts. Even if you're still at a place to consider suicide there is hope for you to realize that it isn't the only way, and it is far from the best way to feel better.

Really, if it is a cry for help I am glad they are one step closer to getting it because they would need and want it desperately. Cries for help should not be taken lightly. People can succeed with an attempt even when they don't truly want to, and continually risking that outcome is concerning. There is no place for downplaying someone's experience, and there is no reason to make someone feel their emotions are not valid if they are distressed and desperate to find a way to relieve that feeling. If you are saying this as a way to point out that maybe the individual truly does not want to end their life, then I agree with you. As I said earlier even people who come very close to completing their suicide attempts feel that way, as well as those who are suicidal in general, because generally it's about seeking relief from the distress not truly seeking an end of life.

People need help sometimes, I hope anyone who needs help does find it. Truly, I hope everyone will find a way to experience some positive emotions again because it is possible, and it is fantastic when you are able to."
depression,ey7rs8f,t3_cvxysx,1566897416.0,"Hey,
I feel this, I've been there. When I started on my antidepressant it seriously changed my life. I've lost close to 50 lbs so far from when I started on them last November. The antidepressant (I take Welbutrin) helped because it took away the excessive appetite that accompanied my depression. I ate to feel better, I ate because I wanted to, because I was mentally and emotionally ""hungry"" not out of physical hunger or need. Now I do feel physical hunger and it is easier because most of the time I have reasonable cravings or the ability to make better choices if I do feel like eating something. I also have the energy and strength not to only order from a food delivery place but to actually go to the store and buy food that isn't all bad. You don't have to start eating only salads or anything, making marginally healthier choices in the beginning helps you follow the path towards healthier eating and a better relationship with food. I was still buying snack cakes and sweetened beverages in the beginning, now I can drink sparkling water and unsweetened tea and I aim to buy fruit instead of processed sweets. Keep your head up and keep trying, any effort is a good start towards getting to where you want to be!"

I also have anxiety and recently went to the doctor to ask for a medication to help with that because it has been more pronounced lately. She told me that sometimes when you treat depression, anxiety symptoms that may have been more closely related to depression will also be treated. She also told me that sometimes it brings the existing anxiety into focus because the other main presenting issue of depression is being treated.

So I've been treating the depression and now I am trying to begin to treat the anxiety. These drugs aren't all bandages, sometimes the issue is a chemical imbalance. I believe the best thing to do is follow sound medical advice. My doctor is pushing me towards trying therapy, and hopefully when some of the anxiety lessens that will be easier for me to accomplish.

Best of luck to everyone!"
AnxietyDepression,exlxblc,t3_ctind3,1566420869.0,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety recently and it is a very validating first step. I hope you appreciate that feeling as well and it propels you into self kindness as well as self improvement (by way of medications and/or therapy). Some people say medications are not truly addressing the issues, but sometimes the issues are chemical. Sometimes the issues are more behavioral and thought based. According to my doctor someone typically does best with both medication and therapy, it is less common to find a person with just one part of that."
TrueOffMyChest,exh0vrg,t3_cseelx,1566285201.0,"I did this too. I had a teenie tiny spider that lived in the corner of my bathroom and barely moved. Never caused me trouble. I named him Mr. Creepy. One day a big gross scary spider decided to also be on the wall in the bathroom, but he was way above Mr. Creepy down in his little home corner... Unfortunately Raid mist falls down when sprayed on a wall. It got them both. I took Mr. Creepy outside hoping somehow that would save him and legit cried. It still hurts me, he was the only spider in my life who I wasn't terrified of and I actually liked."

AnxietyDepression,exgevpx,t3_csq2cu,1566262279.0,"Great job in taking the first step of your treatment!! That is an amazing accomplishment!

 When I started my medication (Welbutrin) I thought I felt it the first few days, but then I got worse again, but then better again once it had time to build up and the dosage changed. Make sure you're on the right starting/maintaining dosage. I know my doctor started me low and got me up to the regular dose, now even higher because that wasn't good enough. I'm not sure how your medication is or how your doctor is approaching it, it just came to mind. My medication makes my appetite go down as well! I have lost a great amount of weight with it. It helped also by giving me energy, and you burn more calories when you aren't in bed all day haha. Make sure to share your concerns with your doctor, especially if you feel worse than you did before starting the medication or like you may be a risk to yourself. If this one doesn't work, keep going! It's worth it to go through trial and error and end up with the best thing for you.

I'm considering seeking therapy, are you considering it as well? It's intimidating to me, but maybe that's my anxiety. Anyways, one step at a time! Best of luck to you!"
Anxiety,exgc86o,t3_csgcpz,1566260351.0,"Absolutely. If you can approach it as something small and inconsequential then I think it can be easier. Also don't try and force yourself to spend hours at a time, start with whatever you can focus for even if it's just reading the introduction to a chapter. Just come back to it when you can and spend the time you can work on it to the best of your ability. It will feel easier because you will eventually get into a zone of concentration. Give yourself time and patience. It's okay if you need to take a lot of breaks. You will feel so proud of any work you accomplish, and you like the subject so there's the internal motivation to learn and that's helpful as well.

You are doing so good. Keep going!"
lonely,exgb4xp,t1_exgadqu,1566259563.0,"I'm sorry to hear that about your medication. They definitely can be really tough to figure out, I wish there was a better way for them to be prescribed without such a trial and error process. 
Your school may provide access to a counselor, potentially on a sliding scale, if so you may be able to supplement your monthly therapy. Maybe you can ask your therapist to advocate for you and help your parents understand your need for more therapy. If the issue is financial there are also sliding scale clinics, maybe you have one near you? That's fantastic, the world needs more people like you in that field. My mom is a nurse and she tells me about CNAs who are rough and uncaring, and I can only hope to never have to interact with them personally. We all want the best for those we love. Thank you for being committed to providing that. I hope you enjoy your schooling this year!"
lonely,exga0aa,t3_csoyxj,1566258817.0,"Hey,

I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling so awful. This community will be here for you, and if you ever need to chat I'm available too.

Please keep going. I'm so happy that you are still here. It's hard, I know that feeling too like questioning meaning in myself and life. I'm going to school in hopes to become a psychologist so I can help people even a little bit because I never want anyone to be stuck feeling how I have. I want to lessen the suffering people go through. I've had a few years in school where that passion and drive literally disappeared into my depression. I'm still trying to recover and treat my depression and anxiety. I started medication for my depression and things became immensely easier, I no longer thought of suicide as an option. Sure sometimes on bad days I lay in bed all day, but it's so much better than it used to be. I think you can get to that point too, and once you do you might even start thinking about your passions, dreams, and happiness again. Even if you can get to where you only feel a little bit of those feelings it's worth it. My medication has also given me a lot more energy, so things that feel too hard have become approachable. I know medication doesn't effect everyone in the same way (and can even make things worse), but I believe if you can find one that works for you it will alleviate a lot of your suffering. Therapy is also a fantastic option, and if your current situation doesn't work out you can always try other therapists. You are worth it, you are still yourself, but you're suffering right now. 

I'm wishing you the best!"
