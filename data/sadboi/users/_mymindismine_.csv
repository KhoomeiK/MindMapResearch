After a lot of tests over the years I got diagnosed with BPD, and the psychologist who did the diagnosis said that I was extremely controlling in my behaviour, which was probably part of why I didn't even think I had it until she tested me for it. I feel the intense emotions and at the same time I have these 'rules' for myself I need to follow. It often feels like I'm getting torn apart.

Internalized homophobia is basically just associating being gay/gay 'behaviour' etc with something negative, because of how we were conditioned all our lives that being gay is bad/inherently sexual/dirty/taboo/wrong/abnormal. 
It shows when you do something that could be considered gay and feel ashamed about it, or when you see someone else behave queer in any way and judge them because of that. 

My whole personality doesn't revolve around my sexuality, but I've had to come to terms with it over the past few years so now I'm comfortable and joke about it. In a post about a movie I like I'd probably comment about the movie, in a post lik this my comment is, appropriately, gay as fuck"
