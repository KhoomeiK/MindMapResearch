I got the impression their tools were strictly for online/digital games. Again, I'm pretty novice. I will have to check it out. Fantastic map!"
SWN,fr1dg7q,t3_ggj3ma,1589817780.0,Can I ask how you made the map? I'm new.
tabletopgamedesign,fllo5j5,t1_fll7twc,1585264353.0,That's cool. Is there a tutorial?

tabletopartists,flgrw3l,t3_foru8y,1585149109.0,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this. Apologies If not. Perhaps you can tell me there appropriate place? I'm not good at Nandeck and never will be. I would like someone to create 1-3 cards for me similar to the examples shown, but I need them to be very easy to edit. They don't need to be pretty, AT ALL! Just easy to edit, add/remove icons, text, and images in INKSCAPE or paint.net.

This is to be used for prototypes.

Please pm me.

Cheers,"

boardgames,es6g768,t3_c624gn,1561648587.0,"I'm glad you wrote this. I've considered writing a similar post regarding the problems with mid-heavy game rules not being intuitive and the need for a ""player support"" chat by publishers. Unfortunately many times some experienced players can be very snobbish if you ask for help with a rule that may seem easy to them and make a comment like ""it says it in the rule book"" etc. This doesn't help the hobby...

By the way there is nothing wrong with party games. Play whatever you want and have fun. There are some game genres I will never get that others love and vica versa."
