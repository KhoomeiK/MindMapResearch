I would apologize to your roommate, tell her that was a one time big mistake and that you value her as a family member and friend, that you don’t want her to move out (wouldn’t be shocked if she was considering it), tell her your working on yourself, and then absolutely do it. I think it’s the kind of thing where you have to prove yourself over time.      

Her friends? Well. There’s not much you can do about that. Just be cordial when you see them and if they want to be judgy then F them, ignore them. Sounds like you should be focusing on YOU and maybe your friends. Who are you surrounding yourself with?

I hope it all works out for you."

I was worried about mysterious mold growing behind the cabinets when in fact it’s the bathroom I should be more focused on. There is some mold under the kitchen sink but I’m going to have that looked at, and not be in total panic mode about the whole wall (thank you!)

The bathroom is absolutely the worst room in the house anyway. I wanted to gut it one day, I’t will cause me no pain (other than financial ) if they tear out the Sheetrock and take a look. Also every exhaust fan in this place seems to be useless and extra noisy anyway so they should be replaced. 

Going to replace the washer. Wondering about the floor. They put in a laminate floating floor in the kitchen. The trend seems to be Anything the previous owner did  that looked nice or  new was because they were trying to hide something. Ha. (The bathroom ceiling was also freshly painted).

My insurance won’t pay for it unless  it’s related to another incident that they pay for.  So me just buying a place with mold isn’t enough to make a claim, but who knows, going forward. If I use remediators maybe insurance or the HOA will kick in .
