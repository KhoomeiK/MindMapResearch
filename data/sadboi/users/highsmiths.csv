Menopause,ey4bsu2,t1_ewecic2,1566787406.0,Hey! I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate your suggestion of the Black Cohosh. I researched it and read about multiple natural things. I ordered this along with Choline and Lions Mane. I have been taking the three of them together and I can’t even begin to express how thankful I am. It has truly truly made a huge difference!!!! I am honestly shocked. Thank you again.

Menopause,ew4byrv,t1_ew48a2q,1565107362.0,Exactly. You only hear about the hot flashes and night sweats. I heard a little about mood swings but nothing in regards to the mental and emotional aspects. I have an appointment scheduled for next week with my PCP. It’s time for my yearly physical anyway so I feel it will be a good time. I’m praying for some relief and I will keep you in my thoughts as well. I do hope that you get what you need also. It’s a very tough place to be in life.
Chihuahua,ew30d4w,t3_cmguxy,1565060511.0,I’m so sorry to hear that her began rough. Thank you for being her rescuing angel. ❤️🐾

Menopause,ew2uhqi,t1_ew2tlcf,1565056180.0,"I appreciate your comment more than you know. I’m sure that you are right. 

I also completely agree with the looking for the next thing to achieve issue. I do try very hard to stop living in the past or the future and appreciate the now. However, I am always looking to “fix” something to avoid fixing myself. This discussion has been a little eye opener for me today."
Chihuahua,ew2reb1,t3_cmfy1v,1565053956.0,Awww poor sweet baby. My thoughts and prayers are truly with her and mom both. 😢
Menopause,ew2k5yk,t1_ew2ju38,1565048761.0,Nowhere NEAR a relaxing cruise!!! 🥵🥶😢😤😰🙄🤢😭😂💤💤💤
Menopause,ew2f70x,t1_ew29ipo,1565045196.0,Thank you.
Menopause,ew2brvk,t1_ew28i7k,1565042844.0,"I COMPLETELY get it. And yes, I am very grateful for my job I’m so many ways. It’s a stressful place to work but the pros far outweigh the cons. The fog and lack of direction you describe, yes me also. I pray that you are able to find something more compatible. I do know the commercial also and when she says “I’ve been taking antidepressants but, I still feel depressed”. This is one reason that I’ve stayed away from them. I assumed it would be like that for me. Also, if I get on medication then I’ve been beaten. I feel like I’ve given in to what I’ve been told that I’d amount to. If that makes any sense. Anyway, this is another thing that I’ve never done in my life. Think this much about my past. I stay on the go all the time moving forward. Now I’m living in the past far too often. I watched the Lion King trailer the other day and when “The Circle Of Life” song started, so did the tears streaming down my face and I reminisced about taking my babies when the original came out. <sigh>"
Menopause,ew22hdl,t1_ew1yuq4,1565036758.0,"Well as I was looking it up, of course it brought up tons of other things. I’m going to order one bottle of “Estrovive”. It actually the Black Cohosh in it."
Menopause,ew1xwdb,t1_ew1rnpl,1565033897.0,I’ll have to look that up. I’ve not heard of it before.
Menopause,ew1xu6z,t1_ew1bsnn,1565033859.0,"I have struggled with depression ever since I can remember. It comes from my upbringing. My parents and my environment. At this moment in my life, I’m angry that I feel this depressed because I have absolutely nothing to feel this way about. For the first time in my life, I have the job I want, decent pay, a house that I’ve remodeled full of my personality, 3 rescue dogs etc. I really just want to slap myself as I’m getting in my own nerves. I think that because I’ve only known the low and depressed state of mind that my body is scared to receive good fate. I honestly do not know. If it weren’t for my dogs, I’m scared I’d have no real feelings at all right now. They are my life. 

I’m considering Amberen or CBD oil."
Menopause,ew1x1oc,t1_ew1qniq,1565033355.0,Thank you for your response. May I ask how long menopause has been for you?
Menopause,ew1jgyu,t1_ew1bsx8,1565024720.0,"I’m trying so hard to go through it without medication. I feel the same, it’s the mental not the physical aspects for me also. There is an OTC med I may try. Or may end up going to my PCP. I just wanted want some energy back"

depression,etptem2,t3_cct3jo,1563064202.0,"My best times are alone. Happy Birthday!

Today, it was raining. I got up got dressed and went to the pet store, Walmart, and Home Depot by myself. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It gives me time to decompress and turn myself off."
depression,etn9u8g,t1_etmtlwz,1562980862.0,Exactly! I know I do 100%! Life would be sooo much easier!
depression,etn5x2g,t1_etmj3iu,1562977639.0,"This my first time actually commenting but, this thread has really made me think about one of the issues that heightens my depression, which is,  is my 27 year old son not being responsible, not making good choices not being self aware. Now I feel at fault for that as well. I probably did too much for him as I was a single parent and I never wanted my boys to ever feel that they were missing out. As a matured adult, I now realize that by them simply not having their “father” around was a void that could never be filled. I did the best that I knew how, and I hope they realize that."
Chihuahua,erg7urx,t3_c1w90z,1560829127.0,They absolutely are! Do you have Apple or Deerhead? I have one of each!❤️❤️
