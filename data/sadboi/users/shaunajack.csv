MakeupAddiction,fr094n5,t3_glwv8f,1589787614.0,CeraVe is a pretty easy brand to find and it has good ingredients and won't break the bank. For oily skin the foaming cleanser might be good. If you start wearing more makeup especially eye makeup or face makeup like foundation you'll need to use a double cleanse system with an oil based cleanser or micellar water followed by a facewash like the mentioned above.

SkincareAddiction,fod60b1,t3_g6tshz,1587680482.0,Apply your moisturizer like 15 mins before hand. Then use a primer and let it sit for 10 mins. Then apply foundation. If it still looks this way then maybe get a new foundation because I think the moisturizer is actually causing this to break up making it look like it's sticking to dry patches when it's not. Also introduce an exfoliant into your routine if you haven't.
SkincareAddiction,fod5py3,t3_g6mc6z,1587680332.0,All of this can be fixed by using a wash cloth and just using a kettle to hear the water up and then mix with cold water for a warm temperature. If you have a wash cloth you can just use it to dampen your face. Rub your cleanser on. Use the cloth to remove it then rinse the cloth and wipe again to make sure it's all gone. You can avoid your eyes this way and also there's not excess water to drop onto the floor or down your arms.

I can leave my house now 
I worked on my relationship and becoming more independent.
So many things but I think getting therapy and then my job really helped me grow as a person.i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder this time last year.
I was self harming every day, ruined almost all my friendships and hated who I was and how incapable of doing stuff I was. 
I am so glad I didn't kill myself.
I still have to get through a lot of shit and I still have days where I feel like not existing would be nice but the more I make it through these tough days the more I realise I am able to steer my future in the direction I want. If I truly felt trapped I could endure it for some time, save and then move country start over figure shit out.

doggrooming,fcrvqbl,t3_eijkz1,1577907268.0,Use a good quality slicker to brush out tangles while drying the hair. If you need to hold the dog while doing this use a standing dryer. Honestly my life saver. If the dog won't let its head be dried use the standing dryer while clipping it's body and legs. Face will be dry by the time you are done. I just bought new moon scissors so I'll probably post about them once I've used them a bit. For clippers I use heiniger saphir clippers. They're great. Have doubles of all blades (more for 10s) and lastly remember: it's just hair. You're not going to permanently disfigure a dog if you cut their hair wrong. Safety is more important than a look. Dogs comfort is more important than a look. Good luck and enjoy it.
