depression_help,fd2wyxo,t3_ejrd55,1578152434.0,"I totally get what your going through. At 14, I was in an abusive relationship where I was physically, mentally, sexually, and emotionally abused. It took a huge toll on me, and thatâ€™s when my anxiety, depression, and a little bit of ptsd really started. I started going to therapy, and the first therapist I went to didnâ€™t really help, I tried two more after that and felt like I was finally getting somewhere with the third. Iâ€™m on break from school and Iâ€™ m going back to see her. I know this is something Iâ€™ll have to live with for the rest of my life so Iâ€™ll constantly be healing and in recovery. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that, and thatâ€™s okay. I also get college can be tough too, I noticed when I left my anxiety and depression went into full swing, and the battles I had to fight with myself got harder everyday. I feel hopeless a lot too, so I totally understand that feeling as well. If you ever need to talk Iâ€™m hereðŸ’š"
depression_help,fd2vmju,t3_ejqbtu,1578152074.0,"Your boyfriend should be your biggest supporter, your best friend, and someone you should constantly always be able to go to. I dated a guy who was never understanding of my mental health problems, and was pretty much doing the same thing your boyfriend was doing. I left, and now Iâ€™m so much happier because I found someone whoâ€™s actually understanding and who tries his best to help me. I know it may be tough but you should let go of your boyfriend, and see if that helps at all (: Iâ€™m always here to talk!!ðŸ’š"
depression,fd0gzlh,t3_ejp00t,1578118652.0,"When I came home for winter break from school, I made an appointment to see my original therapist.
It was really hard, and I felt weak, but realized that there isnâ€™t anything wrong with asking for help. 
Realizing this, Iâ€™m going on a higher dosage of my meds and also realized that if itâ€™s best for me, then thereâ€™s nothing wrong with it!ðŸ’š"
