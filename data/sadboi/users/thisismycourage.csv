relationship_advice,foqsokc,t3_g90uso,1588000117.0,"This scares me. Here’s why. 

I was the one with the low sex drive in the relationship for awhile. My ex used to try to encourage me to drink because it made me more interested. I can’t physically have sex, though. He got more desperate to increase my libido and try to have sex regardless of him knowing I can’t. Started with guilting me and saying he felt less than because I didn’t want to try. When that didn’t work, he encouraged drugs- regardless of my protests- to try to see if it would relax me enough so we finally could. 

He ended up giving me drugs and alcohol and a sexual booster all at once one night. The mix of everything made me black out. He raped me that night. 

Wanting more sex is one thing. Talking about it is healthy and totally okay. Trying to find ways to increase libido TOGETHER is okay. Forcing someone to ingest things they don’t know about for your own benefit is not okay. 

I’m concerned that my experience will repeat with you, as the desperation sounds similar. The drugs are disgusting enough but the parallels to how my situation ended up makes it worse. 

I don’t know another way to put this, but... run."

A little over a year ago, I was sexually assaulted by my then boyfriend of 4 years. It took a few months for me to genuinely process what had happened and even begin the process of moving on. I let myself get into some dark holes and really didn’t help myself in doing so. It wasn’t until August really that I started to handle the situation. 

I sought therapy for that and some other abuse. I’ve reclaimed my story and choose to be open about it when I feel I can be. I found friends who allow me to talk about my experiences and are supportive of my healing. Those have helped immensely. 

While I’m not “cured” and never will be, I’ve definitely healed some. I just spent a week with a really close friend of mine and didn’t have a single panic attack (!!!), but did have anxiety related to sex and finishing (which is apparently not uncommon for SA victims). He was understanding and he was okay with it. 

It’s a few steps forward for me, and yes I still face repercussions from my abuser. It sucks and it’s not fair. But seeking therapy, talking to friends about what he did to me, and even just finding support has really helped in the healing process.

AskReddit,faf9j7r,t1_faf0ed9,1576017474.0,This!! I had a group of 7 guys I knew for 10+ years. They were essentially my brothers and I used to go over weekly for family dinner with them. It was apparently an issue because they were guys. Made my ex wildly uncomfy.
AskReddit,faf95dv,t3_e8u2e3,1576017230.0,"I went to school next to a school shooting. It was our “sister school” so everyone from School A kinda knew everyone from School B. The morning it happened, I remember watching all the teachers in our back hallway gather around and huddle together. I made eye contact with one of them, who was visibly very distressed. I turned to the kid next to me and said “something serious is happening” and he laughed and said I was paranoid. Turns out I wasn’t. They didn’t tell us anything. They tried to hide the whole fact, but since so many people had connections to the other school, we all found out quickly. We went on “loose lockdown” so no going outside, which I still find odd, but whatever. Four kids died. Personally, I wasn’t in the shooting, but I am still a little shaken. 

That previous weekend, I met a kid who was very very cute and I was debating getting his number. I didn’t because I was shy. But, the morning it happened, I was thinking of him and what if we had been texting and blah blah because I’m 14 and had major crushes. I came to find out he was one of the kids who died. That still kinda haunts me."

AskReddit,f7jj6be,t3_dw84zi,1573778764.0,"My boyfriend at the time would go through phases where he'd sleep for 24 hours straight. I went to go see if he was okay after not hearing from him for the day and assuming he was still asleep. I knew the garage code, and where the house key was, so I let myself in.

The alarm started quietly beeping, and so I kept calling his name to come turn it off. No answer. I went to go check on him, and he wasn't in his bed. This would be a good time to note that he had some dangerous sleepwalking habits: he's written notes in his sleep, gotten his car keys in his sleep, etc.. I realized his car wasn't in the garage. I was terrified. I couldn't find him in the house. But *then the alarm started screaming very loudly.*

Their home phone rang. I almost missed the call, but I managed to pick up. It was the security company and they wanted a number code *and* a word code or else they would send the police. They explained that both parents were notified that someone was in the house, as well as some emergency contacts. I was sobbing and trying to explain that I was just the girlfriend and I didn't know what they wanted. They kept asking for the code, and then started saying I had 5 minutes to give it to them, so I became hysterical.

Fear was trying to figure out if my boyfriend was dead and also trying to not get arrested in the same breath."

He’s been a jerk to me anyways, but it really hurts watching the favoritism in action. I’m 21 now, and I’ve grown past needing his affection, but it still is a really shitty feeling being very obviously disliked in comparison.

Talk to him. If nothing changes, be there for the neglected son. It hurts. A lot. It hurts my heart thinking of everything I dealt with as a kid- even other people noticed the difference in treatment between me and my sisters. I tried to figure out how to make him love me more for eons. 

A kid doesn’t deserve to be asking themselves what they did wrong to have a parent dislike them. Because the answer is nothing. And that’s something I wish I could tell my younger self."
