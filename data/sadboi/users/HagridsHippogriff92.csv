videos,fbuv61p,t1_fbupvmp,1577120871.0,"Going to piggy back off this comment and mention that correlation doesn‚Äôt directly equal causation in a lot of instances. I can‚Äôt be sure because studies are a little scarce, but I would assume some of the reason that pits have higher stats for dog bites is because they‚Äôre usually the primary dog breed selected by illegal dog fighters, and dogs (unprofessionally) trained as guard dogs. Their breed in particular isn‚Äôt necessarily more inclined than, let‚Äôs say, a German Shepherd to be overly protective and attack with little provocation. 

It‚Äôs all in the training, ownership, and understanding your dog‚Äôs behavioral tendencies and adjusting accordingly. For instance, I have a boxer mix who is the friendliest most loving dog ever, but she has a tendency to be a little territorial (just growling, nothing more) if she hasn‚Äôt met another dog before. She‚Äôs never been aggressive, but for precautions sake, I never let her off leash in the off chance she would react poorly around a dog she‚Äôs never met. I understand that about her and train her and adjust my handling accordingly. Clearly these owners failed to see that it wasn‚Äôt wise to let the dog off leash in any capacity. 

It pains me a little that they have to even mention the breed in situations like this because it perpetuates unfair stereotypes, when true statistics would probably show that the pits that attack are normally outliers coming from the product of poor ownership rather than a well cared for and handled dog."

If your visiting a country and want to see elephants, never ride them. There are elephant sanctuaries you can visit, but it‚Äôs important to do research to ensure they are actually ethical.

EDIT: A lot of people are making the assumption that because an animal is significantly larger than a human, that it can support its weight. Animals have a huge variance in anatomy. Their ability to support weight does not necessarily directly correlate to their size. Furthermore, the larger issue at hand is that almost any organization that makes money off tourists in the animal business in these countries abuse these animals because it‚Äôs not regulated.

AskReddit,f2xo5nm,t3_demubh,1570480578.0,"Last time someone asked this question I got downvoted because I tried to explain that the standard of service would go down, but it‚Äôs true. 

I used to work at a high end steakhouse where the top server was making close to 6 figures. The tipping system encourages servers to upsell so that the make more money, and in turn it helps sales. As well, when servers are working for a tip, the standard of service is much higher. They‚Äôre going to care a lot less about refilling your drink if if you cut their wages down from $30+/hour to a standard $15/hour. You‚Äôre also going to get shittier employees working in restaurants in general. 

You can make a decent livable wage off of working in the service industry when tipping is involved, and taking that away from people is not going to go over well. Yeah, you can live off of $15 and hour if you‚Äôre single and healthy, but imagine trying to support a family or pay medical bills or god knows what else on that salary. Not fun."

politics,evcq647,t3_cjc1ru,1564420812.0,"So I was listening to NPR the other day and I thought they brought up a good point, and I would love to hear others opinions on it: 

Most liberals (including myself), feel that Trump should probably be impeached. A lot of the pushback had come from people saying that although the House will likely get enough votes, that the senate will overturn it. Still many people think it would still be good so that it will air out all evidence and people will truly know what crimes have been committed, and will likely harm his chances In 2020. 

This all being said, the person speaking on NPR said a good reason to avoid it if we‚Äôre not certain he will be officially removed is because he will be officially exonerated if the senate doesn‚Äôt vote to remove him from office (likely to happen). In that case, he wouldn‚Äôt be able to be charged after he leaves office. This actually seems to be the only legitimate reason that makes sense for not bringing forth impeachment proceedings, and I was curious as to what the pros and cons of this would be. 

Personally I would be pissed if the senate didn‚Äôt charge him with crimes and he were able to leave office and never be charged, but at the same time I‚Äôm astounded that he hasn‚Äôt been impeached when Clinton was for just lying about a blow job."
