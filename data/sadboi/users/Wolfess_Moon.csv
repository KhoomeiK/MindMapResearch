There are many people here saying the same thing.

Unless you've tried therapy and medication, or a mix of both, for a long time, and sometimes you've got to try a mix of different meds and various forms of therapy to find what works, then you don't need a SD.

Everyone thinks they ""need"" one, when in reality a lot just *want* one.

If you buy one outright, be prepared to spend a **minimum** of $25,000, for what you need. If you train your own, yes it's cheaper, but it's so much extra work, on top of you trying to manage your illnesses. That's **not** ideal.
You also have to be prepared for your prospect (potential SDiT) to end up washing out (failing) despite doing the training right yourself.

They can also only typically work until age 6-8 iirc, and then need to retire, so you need to prepared to do all this over again in a few years, after spending at least 2 from 8 weeks old training it.
