BPD,fqpchtj,t3_gk59f8,1589542554.0,This is how all of my failed relationships started.
drugstoreMUA,fp2bu0c,t3_galbgk,1588259001.0,Wow you are honestly one of the most beautiful women I have EVER seen.
nintendo,fnuigum,t3_g3ptch,1587262867.0,"We found out we’re expecting a new baby- it’s been 2 years of trying to conceive since our last miscarriage. Although the timing isn’t the greatest, it’s definitely our little light in a dark time."
Vaping,fi3qxk0,t3_f6bmpd,1582125739.0,"Good luck!! I don’t know you, but I’m proud of you."
BPD,fhuyhfe,t1_fhuwr8y,1581891535.0,And it’s always SO intense while it’s happening. It’s like whatever you’re fixating on is your lifeline- and then a few months later it means nothing to you. I completely understand.
BPD,fhuloi3,t3_f4t73g,1581887718.0,"Every time I read posts in this sub my mind is blown at how I can relate to everything, after not being able to relate to “normal” people my entire life. 

My latest fixation seems to be Spanish shows & actors. I’m an English speaking Canadian who was trying to learn Spanish. Also- internet stalk all the Spanish actors from my show, watch every movie/show any of the actors have been in, draw them, write stories about them, create them on the sims, I even went as far as to cut and dye my hair the exact same way as the main character. 

Now it’s wearing off and I feel worse than I did before. I’m glad someone can relate."
NoStupidQuestions,fhkvnev,t3_f3lm43,1581692043.0,"The other night I heard my cat scratching in the litter box- you know, when they dig around for 10 minutes right when you’re almost asleep? I opened my eyes and both of my cats were sleeping in my bed. 

Now THAT scared me."
Marriage,fh1gkgo,t1_fgzcp41,1581215075.0,Do we have the same husband?
BPD,ffxf63l,t1_ffx6bgl,1580323904.0,This is inspiring. It’s definitely an identity thing where I don’t know who I want to be so I try to pick a career that suits whoever I am in that moment. If that makes sense- then when that passes I’m back at the start of not knowing what to do because it doesn’t feel “right” anymore. Ugh
BPD,ffxeggf,t1_ffx8gga,1580323487.0,That’s EXACTLY how I feel. I’m so glad I found this community of people who know and understand exactly how I feel. Thank you for this!
BPD,ffx3e7y,t3_evov3r,1580316900.0,I’m a Virgo.
BPD,ffx1yok,t3_evntve,1580316019.0,YES!! This has been on my mind a lot lately. I’m starting to see a pattern that just so happens to sync up with my cycles.
EarthPorn,ffwzlvr,t3_evjghp,1580314563.0,I thought this was The Sims 4
LaCasaDePapel,ffwxdg7,t3_evdpmh,1580313160.0,I could watch 10 more seasons tbh it’s probably the best show I’ve watched in a long time and I’m not ready for it to be over just yet
PaleMUA,fftftnx,t3_euwodc,1580219326.0,"The right side matches your skin tone better, but the left side has more coverage and more of a smooth matte look."
LaCasaDePapel,fftfep3,t3_eswk1i,1580218980.0,I searched all the actors and slowly started making my way through all of their movies and TV shows while waiting for part 4. Vis á Vis is a good show.
christmas,fbr0c1q,t3_ee1k1r,1577037618.0,This is so unique!! I’ve never seen anything like it. Love it!!
drugstoreMUA,fb3arvt,t3_eb82jj,1576468261.0,Wait- Walmart has their own beauty brand???? Since WHEN?! I love Walmart. I need to try it ASAP.
electronic_cigarette,ewjh4ih,t1_ewiyw5g,1565466577.0,"No problem! If you have any questions I’d be happy to help. I forgot to add that the draw is fairly tight. It has a lot of resistance, so puffing on it is so similar to smoking a cigarette. I’m a bit obsessed lol if I could I would gift one to every smoker I know. They also come in packs of 2 usually so when one device is charging you always have a back up :)"
electronic_cigarette,ewips5k,t3_co5ao3,1565454312.0,"The Kangertech E-Smart has helped get me off of smoking. It’s a small, pen style. It gives off thin vapour so no huge obnoxious clouds. 12mg or 18mg  freebase nic gives me a cigarette-like throat hit. It’s only been a week and I’m down to 6mg. The E-Smart really mimics smoking a cig for me. I would definitely recommend!"
electronic_cigarette,ewinne2,t3_coap32,1565453123.0,Leak proof AND comes in 7 colours?! Yes please.
Vaping,evztnw6,t3_clvz3u,1564966976.0,Wow this is amazing!!! I would pay someone to do this for me
Makeup,evwifmf,t3_clmc36,1564864904.0,Freeman charcoal scrub!!! It’s drugstore and it’s the best thing EVER
BipolarReddit,evuw31i,t3_clcvq5,1564808424.0,"I feel like I could have wrote this post. Especially when it comes to social media, it’s one extreme to the other. Revealing photos, to the I-wish-I-was-dead- quotes."
nosleep,evuvp00,t3_ckw07c,1564808008.0,Where’s the next update?!?
waiting_to_try,evu232o,t3_cl60p4,1564783746.0,"For me, the wait for baby #4 has been the hardest so far. I miscarried spring 2018 and due to health issues and finances we’re waiting until life gets back on track. 

I think the wait for a rainbow baby is a lot more intense."
BPD,evtwdgo,t3_cl6jkw,1564779918.0,Same. Having a mother who is a pathological liar probably doesn’t help a whole lot either. She’s told me 100 different stories of my childhood trauma... but I can’t remember which one is true.
Empaths,evte2vc,t3_cl5ava,1564768427.0,"I never get that feeling. I love Walmart. It might have to do with the fact that I’m in Canada, and the people are almost always friendly."
Canadian_ecigarette,evtdm9e,t3_cl6zf3,1564768149.0,I think Fat Panda does wholesale. I’m not very much help but I just wanted to say congrats and I wish you luck!
nosleep,evrll8k,t3_ckw07c,1564711579.0,"Please keep this going for as long as possible. I’m hooked- I’ve been checking for a new update all day!! 

My heart is singing at the fact that you started a new garden for Derek. Genius idea"
Vaping,evlhl4r,t1_evkyaj4,1564594796.0,Thanks!! I found that one on sale with a free 30ml juice. And it has great reviews! It’s tempting me
Vaping,evlh4qs,t1_evlahge,1564594641.0,Okay awesome thank you for that info
Vaping,evko2m7,t1_evkmr2b,1564584215.0,Can you use nic salts in any kind of device? Or do I need a specific type for nic salts?
Vaping,evknrb7,t1_evkm0s4,1564584106.0,"Thank you!! I’ll look into that. There’s so much to take in, so many options. The world of vaping has come such a long way since I bought a cig-a-like from the gas station back in 2011 lol I’m clueless"
Vaping,evkepfk,t1_evizss8,1564580376.0,I’d like to know as well
BPD,evatsoj,t3_cj1p2y,1564357035.0,I do this all the time. I never thought there was a reason why I did it... but this makes a lot of sense.
PaleMUA,evab64n,t3_ciwz0u,1564343364.0,WOW!! Those lashes are insane! You are so beautiful
