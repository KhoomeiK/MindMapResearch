My mom was 22 when she got pregnant with me, and she went to get an abortion because she was saving all of her money to go to university for forensic science. That was her dream.

My mom has to give up her dream and marry him to create a stable family for me. She went hungry most days, my father abused alcohol and left us, and my mom had to settle for a career she didn‚Äôt want so we wouldn‚Äôt end up homeless. 

My father ruined my mother‚Äôs life entrapping her with a child. I am not mad at my mom for telling me all this. I love her dearly and I feel fucking broke for her.

I was asked to cover a visit at a family transitioning out of our county of service for their final visit. I am not including any names so as to cover HIPPA. This was in my old homestate about a month before Halloween. I'm driving up this street in a very well-to-do neighborhood and my GPS keeps telling me I'm getting closer. I see a house on my right that is decorated for Halloween. Nay, not just decorated. It is absolutely decked out in Hollywood-level animatronics, floral arrangements, lights, and fog machines. I have the inkling that THIS is the house I need to go to for the visit. It is. When I pull up, the garage door is open and there is an 8 foot cloth spider, but no people. I get out, and a woman appears. She is dressed in the wildest Halloween sweater, and introduces herself as the client's mother. Client has severe CP and parents are the legal guardians, so I mainly talk with them. The client is coming home in five minutes from physical therapy, so she invites me in. Almost immediately asks me ""Can you help me with something while we wait? It's time to feed the pets."" Of course I say yes, and I'm led to a furnished basement where this woman has a state of the art room for 8 ferrets. I am asked to hold ferrets while she cleans the cages, and I get to feed ferrets treats. So many wiggly babies. This woman is also a dog groomer and has 5 dogs, which she warns me about when we go up to the first floor. There are two Blue Tick Coonhounds, two Beagles, and a very very old Dachsund. Client is coming in the house so the mom sits with me while the dad gets their children settled. I am covered in so many dogs at this point. We're finally moving to the dining room to talk about transition, and the mom says ""I'm so sorry you had to come so late. It's so busy with us but this was our only easy night. I hope you don't mind that we're going to have dinner."" Of course I don't mind. I didn't realize that she was also going to feed me. This is normally frowned upon, however, it is not considered a gift, so I oblige. We go through their whole case, eat chicken cordon bleu, and generally get acquainted. We discuss what it'll be like for the client to live in a group home. Family is so nice a grateful. The husband invites me to see the backyard of this immaculate home which has a perfect garden, and a 30 foot long koi pond. I talk to them about the koi pond at my mom's house, and we feed the fish. They're a really wonderful, charitable, sweet family. Finally, I am leaving, but the parents are trying to send me home with leftovers and these weird chili chocolates. I explain I can't have gifts but they pretty much forced me.  We get out front, and it's dark out. The husband explains that they decorate like this every year because they collect Hollywood props. I'm told to wait a minute; he flicks a few switches, and every light and animatronic comes on. Fog, lights, movement, the monster mash is playing. They put this show on every night for the neighborhood to enjoy and do that for Christmas too, just to make the kids happy. They were the funniest, most vibrant, wonderful family I ever knew. I hope they had an easy transition after I left the agency. They made my year."
rant,f6kie19,t3_drih29,1572912832.0,"On one hand, I get it. It starts too early in the commercial sense.

I decorated all the trees, hung in the area to get trees from the trailer, load them into cars. They started coming in August, which is too early. Stores shove stuff down your throat and stress you out when the holiday should be about spending time with loved ones and spreading good will.  


However. A personal reason I start putting up decorations early is because my maternal grandmother's birthday was Christmas eve. She was the single most important female relative I had in my life other than my mother and even 10 years after her dying, I miss her a lot. It's stupid, but putting up the tree reminds me of her.

AskReddit,f3zoyey,t1_f3zoab1,1571273721.0,This is really honest. Thank you for sharing.
AskReddit,f3zo082,t1_f3znd2j,1571273280.0,"Not sure if you meant this to be funny, but I like the sense of humor if that's what you meant. Also appreciate your honesty."
AskReddit,f3zbi9c,t3_dik12v,1571265724.0,For work I had to visit the homes of people with past felonies. I forgot to tell my boss I went straight home after my last appointment and she thought the client killed me.  W H O O P S :(
AskReddit,f3vnhv0,t3_di7vbr,1571180204.0,"This has come to pass, but a guy I used to know had a child porn addiction. It‚Äôs the worst thing I know personally. He had thousands of files on his computer. I had to report him to law enforcement because I‚Äôm a mandated reporter. He knew it was illegal and a problem, but he ‚Äújust couldn‚Äôt stop.‚Äù I sincerely hope he got the treatment he needed to move past his addiction."

AskReddit,f0ueix2,t1_f0s7a7y,1568938773.0,"That's horrible. I'm so sorry. At my current job, we deal with a lot of landlords like this, and I'm trying my best to get my clients out of those homes. I'm sorry you had to deal with that."
AskReddit,f0uedd3,t3_d6d73t,1568938706.0,"Apologies in advance for the sad story, but my biological father. I recognize he had a serious addiction his whole life, and addiction pushes people to do terrible things, but he put my life in danger all the time.  Before he divorced my mother, he quit both his jobs, meaning my mom took on two part time jobs (on top of her full time job) to make sure we didn't end up homeless. Once they were divorced, he would get visitation with me and every single time he drank a full bottle of Yukon Jack in front of me, in the car, then drove me 40 minutes to his house. Constantly left me with his equally disgusting friends to go find alcohol (I cannot stomach discussing what they did/said. It's just too much to dig up emotionally). Also never showed up on time/at all for my middle and high school graduations, any of my horse shows, or birthdays. Made sexual comments about me when I was in the sixth grade. When I was in under grad, I tried to salvage the relationship with him because he got sober, but he constantly guilted me for money while I was working 3 jobs and going to college. Tried to rip the steering wheel out of my hands for cigarettes, allowed his then girlfriend to storm into his apartment to fight with him about me ""destroying their relationship."" I just stopped talking to him one day. I tell a white lie to people saying he's gone, like passed away. Having people tell me that I need to ""forgive him"" when I say he's still alive just sends me into a blind rage. He's the single worst person to have walked through my life. Don't worry, I am healthy and happy now that he is not around."

AskReddit,f0fl623,t1_f0end0u,1568585146.0,Means you command a room. My prior coworkers said similar things. It's great that you pull attention to you.
AskReddit,f0fl2p4,t1_f0fdq91,1568585099.0,Good on you!
AskReddit,f0fl058,t3_d4nevg,1568585064.0,"Let me mention non-physical things first:  
1. My confidence in being an independent worker.  
2. My intuition.  
3. My resilience after a lifetime of familial dysfunction, witnessing a suicide, etc. Just my ability to hold it together. 

Physical:  
1. Legs. Love being the tall girl.  
2. Eyes. Inherited the weird yellow color that my grandma had in hers."

AskReddit,f0fj7vx,t1_f0ehk0h,1568584222.0,"It's a personal question to ask. If it's a close friend, it's even a little bit of an assumption. What would be more appropriate would be ""Do you think you'll have kids?"". And then people not ragging you if you can't/won't have kids."
