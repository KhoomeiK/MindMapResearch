AmItheAsshole,fmdn9jt,t3_fubkfr,1585972263.0,"YTA...you’re mad that she’s practicing her religion, trying to give your son new experiences and a better way of understanding her, and she’s been respectful during all of it. You must be out of your mind. If she was catholic you wouldn’t be upset she had a crucifix in the room. You’re being super judgmental of how she chooses to participate in her religion. Unless it is ACTIVELY (having candles doesn’t count) harming you then leave the gal alone."
