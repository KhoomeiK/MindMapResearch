unpopularopinion,fllyug4,t1_fllwmg5,1585270689.0,It’s not my duty. It’s just a thing I’m allowed to do and I’m appreciative that I’m allowed that but I don’t think it’s everyone’s duty to do it. I think it should be left to people who are informed on these things and I’m not. Nor do I have to be informed about it.
unpopularopinion,fllkqbj,t1_fllk6br,1585262282.0,Am I morally obligated though? Who’s morals are these? I have things to do in my life that don’t involve studying policies and politicians. I’m not going to go vote without putting in good legwork and if you care about your country then you shouldn’t pressure everyone to vote because a lot of us don’t really know what we’re doing.
unpopularopinion,flljevn,t1_fllikmq,1585261504.0,It’s a societal guilt thing. I’m sure glad I’m not being forced to vote for some jerk at gunpoint like in other countries.
unpopularopinion,fllizvp,t1_flliod9,1585261266.0,"No that’s not true. You don’t have to be part of the problem or part of the solution. You can also be neutral. That’s a phrase put into place to to help block rights movement and you can absolutely be neutral. If you decide you’re obligated to vote when you haven’t done your due diligence and learned about the candidates, then you’re a part of the problem."
unpopularopinion,fllioow,t1_fllifo2,1585261091.0,"Politics don’t interest me, I don’t closely follow politicians and I think anyone who’s making the decision of who will be in office should be well informed on the policies and character of those running. I think a lot of people vote without much information"

unpopularopinion,flkinvd,t3_fp2jhc,1585241645.0,"News flash, bucko, it will be harder. Sorry but the world is too full of people and the more crowded it gets the crazier everyone will become. Hopefully people start limiting the number of children you’re allowed to have soon. But yes I agree, if they have it easier then your generation succeeded"
unpopularopinion,flkidqk,t3_fp4arb,1585241495.0,"Racism was a huge deal in the US. Like a HUGE DEAL for a long ass time. We had to learn the importance of equality where as many other places never really did. As a result, yeah we are pretty ahead of the game on equality. Many Asians are very racist as well, even Japanese which shocked me since they’re so outwardly respectful. The US really is a great place and I’m proud to be from here."
unpopularopinion,flkhifj,t1_fljjaoq,1585241029.0,Nope I never have. I just have heard everyone go buck wild about how addicting and great it is. I guess I should have investigated more before buying but uhh... I super don’t like it.
unpopularopinion,fljgrsl,t3_fp1mmg,1585211879.0,this isn’t an opinion as much as it is a fact
unpopularopinion,fljgpjv,t3_fp51r8,1585211801.0,I agree. Spiders mostly hang out in one spot. I let them hang out in my house if they’re not intrusive because I hate hate HATE bugs and if my spider friends kill a bug I will be happy

unpopularopinion,fljetg8,t1_fljejs2,1585209485.0,I do like that type of game. Stardew Valley is a masterpiece! This game is just SO boring though. There should be more to do than there is. Stardew is simple and relaxing but brimming with things to keep you engaged. I picked 90 weeds to get 900 bells to buy a campfire cooking set. I got it and discovered I can’t cook anything...and it looks worse than the regular free campfire. How could they seriously not implement a simple cooking system? This game lacks depth and is gimmicky. Wow real time? Why would I play a game for this? I wouldn’t. Collecting tons of stuff just to sell it all and get basically nothing back? It’s just not fun. If you haven’t tried stardew valley I can’t recommend it enough. There are relaxing games that far outclass this massive disappointment.
unpopularopinion,flje2f5,t3_foqmxr,1585208586.0,Eh. They just haven’t thought it out. Surely they don’t want unimaginable suffering for mankind in both the process of dying but also the impact that makes on families. I think Limiting the number of children people can have is a great solution honestly. No crushing pain or unnecessary suffering. Some people would be disappointed of course but it seems like it would solve a lot of troubles.
