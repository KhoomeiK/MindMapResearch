BipolarReddit,fkbmah8,t1_fkbiyib,1584035633.0,"I think we perceive the psychiatric industry a bit differently. I believe patients have to be their own advocates and should always be seeking out information and working to understand the bigger picture and smaller detail that a doctor might miss since they only see you for a 15-minute transaction every few months. And not all psychiatrists are good and I don’t think everything should be accepted blindly. I did that when I first started out receiving treatment and it resulted in the hardest crash and burn of my life, all because I trusted the psychiatrist completely and didn’t know any better. Psychiatry is focused almost completely on treating disorders with medication. So much is missed when looking through that narrow window. I love that I can come to Reddit for more stories and anecdotes."

My psychiatrist specifically recommended cannabis for me when I brought it up (I already smoked) and so he referred me to a “weed card doctor” who can prescribe it. They have to go through a different certification process. I could have gone to that doctor without talking to my psychiatrist, but if you’re receiving treatment through a psychiatrist for bipolar you will want to mention substance use anyway. 

I have to see my psychiatrist every 3 months to keep my non-weed prescriptions. 

I have to see my weed doctor every 6 months to keep my weed prescription, a process which we both see as an arbitrary formality that costs a fortune because the state says it has to, which in our opinion is to weed out (hah) the market and just make it harder for people to get it."

BipolarReddit,fjhduna,t3_fddng6,1583346211.0,"There are many things you can change to affect how it affects your life. Light, sleep, diet, exercise, lifestyle choices. My understanding is the effect of trauma on my life is more debilitating than the cycles themselves. Because when they are over I am still stunted, feeling numb or not engaging with life, expression, physical experience like yoga, etc. 

There is a really good book entitled “The Body Keeps Score” that I would highly recommend checking out. The build-up of life experience of bipolar generally results in lots of unseen blocks getting in the way of embodying your full self. So many of these things are experienced by so many people that don’t have bipolar too. The only way through is to engage but it can be more exhausting than inspiring at first. Do you have a DBSA (depression and bipolar support alliance) meeting in your area? They’re on their website! 

My therapist had a profound effect on me when she discussed my relationship with my hypomanic self and to not be ashamed of her. She makes me feel connected with the world, incredibly creative, I meet all kinds of new people, I see things in new ways. With the experience of mania, I can empathize with people who also go out of control and know what that’s like.

I also take Adderall which I am worried I won’t be able to use if I go off the other medications. 

I have heard great things about keto diet for clarity. Fish oil and some other supplements are shown to help with cognitive functioning as well.

I thought maybe there was a setup by my family and friends for me to get help, which irritated and embarrassed me.
