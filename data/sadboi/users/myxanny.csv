What helped me a lot with my suicidal thoughts were my psychiatrist, and the medicines. I still think about it everyday but now I'm living for MYSELF and MY goals. Put yourself some goals like.. getting outta bed get a shower and listen to a happy song everyday. Not a goal like I NEED TO LOSE 10 POUNDS THIS WEEK or I NEED TO GO TO COLLEGE or even I NEED TO HANG WITH PEOPLE AND DRINK. Just... Think about you like the most, and do it for you. I know it is a struggle, but dying is painful, I tried so many times and thank God or anything you believe, didn't work. Just, one day at a time. If you feel like crying, cry. But dont drown yourself, you're here for a reason. And let me tell you something, I was lonely and depressed scrolling through Reddit and saw your post and I thought about all the advices that daily I give to myself, and it makes me want to live. Idk, thank you for reminding me of my own advices. And you are worth it. People care, they just dont know whats going on our heads. 

If you need, text me."
