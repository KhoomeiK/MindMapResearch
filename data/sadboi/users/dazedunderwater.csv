bipolar2,f5axh9s,t3_dn8c1p,1572114941.0,Yeah I've had sensory processing problems since I was young but only got bipolar in university. Pink noise is rad for mellowing out auditory and sometimes other triggers. And distractions while eating helps. I use weed for pain and certain strains help get over the aversion. CBD oil 1:4-1:1 is the most body friendly way that is still effective.

So I do what little things I can. You can volunteer from home, slowly work on crafts or writing, learn new things. And find our communities online. See if there are any cfs or chronic illness groups you could go to. It's good to talk it out with others in your situation. Just remind yourself that we are worth much more than our productivity!"

But you are who you are and you are still here. Which means you can find your way to find your purpose. Look into people that may need cheap assistance (and possibly under the table if that works). There are older people who have no children to take care of them or child care is always needed and doesn't need a degree. Start small. Work up. Figure out what you can do and what people need. Hopefully things won't be this dire for too long. And throwing yourself into helping others can often help you yourself.
