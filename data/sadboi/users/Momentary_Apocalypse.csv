Maybe they just don’t trust the pdoc’s diagnosis. As always, you know yourself best, so if you need something else reach out and self-advocate."
BipolarReddit,fqucxph,t3_gkvovt,1589656557.0,"While it does sound like early stage hypomania, it could be a more benign adjustment to changes in your lifestyle. If you’re on lockdown now,  as many of us have been, then much of what you describe - spending time on hobbies, completing projects, socializing on the Internet, etc. - IS the new normal. You’re probably also getting a lot more physical rest during the day, and some daily stresses like commuting and office politics may be reduced.

It sounds like you’re at least cognizant of the symptoms to be on the lookout for. If you just need less sleep at the moment then it may be okay to put off saying anything. If you notice other or worsening symptoms then you should say something, and you can point to the lost sleep as part of a recognizable pattern."
BipolarReddit,fqi0oa5,t3_gj0anj,1589387825.0,"I'm with you! This has removed a lot of stresses from my life. 

I've had the extra time to get projects done, and to learn to play an instrument that I've wanted to learn for 20 years. I taught my daughter how to ride a bike. I don't have to worry about school plays, choir concerts, and sporting events. The fact that I can get to work without fighting traffic, or avoid huge crowds at the store, more than offsets other inconveniences. 

I'm fortunate that I work in an essential field, so I'm still able to go to work, and my wife is able to tele-work from home, so we haven't felt the economic impacts. I know a lot of other people are suffering, and I have some extroverted friends who feel the complete opposite, but for me - for now - this has been almost all upside.

And we all know how moody and temperamental celebrities can be.  And now that people have some idea what the symptoms are, they start seeing them everywhere - real or imagined. 

For a while, antidepressants were the most prescribed drugs in America (I don’t know about other places) but there couldn’t possibly be that many clinically depressed people. I suspect we’re seeing a similar situation with bipolar. At least there’s now some awareness in the broader population, but it does feel like the severity of this disorder is being minimized because it’s trendy."
BipolarReddit,fkox0np,t3_fjp0b1,1584396881.0,"I didn't know that I was bipolar, and I didn't even understand what that meant. Popular misconceptions, and distorted portrayals in the media didn't help, either. 

However, I knew I wasn't like everyone else. I didn't know how people could hold down a job without it weighing them down, or eventually feeling like they were meant for something more and walking away to find their passion. 

I didn't know why I sometimes felt like I could do just about anything, but couldn't hold myself together long enough to make anything of it. Sure I could come up with amazing ideas for a book, song, movie, or whatever, but I could never keep the surge going long enough to see it through. Not without either getting sidetracked by the next great idea, or slipping into a depression and giving up. 

Same with relationships. I'd meet an amazing girl and fall head over heels in love. I'd stay up all night talking to her. I'd do crazy impulsive things to impress her. Then I'd either fall into a depression and isolate myself, or I'd see another girl and fall head over heels in love... either way I'd break her heart.

I knew I got depressed a lot, but I didn't realize it was cyclical, and I didn't know it was clinical. After all, wouldn't anyone get depressed if they couldn't hold down a job, or make any of their great ideas actually work, or stay in a relationship?

The problem was that I didn't know that other people don't go through the same shit. It's not like we talk about our failures with friends and family, let alone strangers. As far as I could tell I was just an epic loser.

Quetiapine calms my brain enough that I can focus, and not only find the right words, I can stay on task long enough to put out my best work - whether it's academic or job related. However, Abilify was terrible for me. It gave me unbearable akathisia and ruined my ability to concentrate.

When I went through prolonged episodes it would wear me out, and I'd feel the fatigue, but I couldn't stop. I'd be dying for sleep - just one good night's rest - but I just couldn't get to sleep and wake up feeling refreshed. Even if I did manage a good night's sleep once, it wasn't enough to make up for the lack for so long. I'd wake up feeling awful, but the energy would come back through the day, and then I'd stay up too late and ruin it again. The cycle just continued until the inevitable crash into depression. 

You're wise to recognize the pattern. Make sure you discuss it with your doctor.

Effective sleep management has made the biggest improvement in my stability. Now I can go to sleep when I need to and I wake up feeling functional, if not fully refreshed, more often than not."

Ultra-Wideband location sharing may add some value down the road, but we won’t know until Apple finalizes it, and third parties make use of it. The additional GB of RAM is useful, but not absolutely necessary. It’s mainly needed for the advanced photo editing. Of course, it all depends on how you use it. 

If the latest camera tech isn’t as important to you, and you’re not swayed by the promise of UWB, then you’re not giving up much by going with the XR. The price difference is relatively small, but still significant, so it comes down to whether those newer features are worth $100 (USD).

It was $200 when it was released, but you can still buy them new for around $150 for the base 3/32 model. There’s also a 4/64 model but it’s harder to find. The unskinned Android runs pretty well in 3g of RAM though, so it’s not as noticeable a loss from the 4g in the G6.

BipolarReddit,f3c5b7t,t3_dgh3db,1570819970.0,"I’ve ruined at least 2 lucrative careers, and lost countless jobs. I know how dispiriting it is. Even now that I’m properly medicated and getting therapy, I’ve turned down job offers with real career tracks that I know I wouldn’t be able to handle. The difference is that now I know better and won’t jump in just because I believe, in that moment, that I can do anything and nothing can bother me. I have a low stress job now, and even though it’s painfully boring, and the pay is minimal, I get more from the stability of actually keeping the job. Someday, with the confidence I’m building now, I’ll be able to take on more. 

If you can find a job that you can do every day, then you’ll eventually find the ability to move up to something better. Give this one a chance, and if it’s not working, you can look for other work while still pulling in the income. If this isn’t the job, don’t feel too bad about finding something else. Just remember that the grass isn’t always greener, and the hard stuff gets easier with time. 

Find someone to support you while you make the adjustment and hang in there as long as you can. Best of luck to you."

I’m leaning heavily toward the Samsung A series because of the value for what you pay. The A50 is a Pixel 3a competitor, and the A20 is both inexpensive and has a huge 4000 mAh battery. Software and security updates are quarterly instead of monthly, but I’ll take that over the absolutely nothing we get from LG."
lgg6,f328ujl,t1_f3183lx,1570597705.0,"I’ve never had a problem either, but lots of people have, so this has become the go-to advice. It’s probably overkill in most cases but it covers all the bases and saves a lot of frustrating trial and error when something goes wrong. 

A simpler alternative is to make sure you have a backup of your personal data, and then clear all the system and app caches (LG Smart Cleaning in settings), before you run the update. The safest way to do the update is with LGUP on your computer instead of over-the-air. It has additional download verifications and can prevent flashing a corrupted update file. 

They may not be entirely necessary, but these steps can give you some added peace of mind, and avoid the hassle of resetting the whole phone and restoring all of your apps and accounts. You still have the option of a full wipe if there are problems afterward."

BipolarReddit,f2fdkti,t3_dd7ubc,1570215690.0," Taken at face value it’s definitely disturbing and a damaging portrayal that perpetuates negative stereotypes. 

It’s worth mentioning, though, that the events of the movie are portrayed as an unreliable narrative from the Joker’s POV. The viewer doesn’t know what’s real or imagined, whether the slights and abuses he goes through are as bad as we see them or as bad as he wants to see them. We don’t know what his “mental illness” really is. For all we know it’s his own excuse for being a psychopath. 

I think it’s a brilliant piece of cinema, but the problem is that many viewers won’t understand, and believe that mental illness = dangerous."
