marriageadvice,fm716uv,t3_ft9m3b,1585809628.0,"It’s usually because of a deeper problem and/or a personal struggle.

My husband and I went through a phase of arguments and it ended up being a problem with communication. He was silenced a lot growing up and was conditioned to believe that he wasn’t “manly” if he was honest about his thoughts. I struggled with anger issues from trauma and loss in my past. Through therapy and consistent effort, we found a middle ground. We ended up closer.... after hearing about his past, I felt horrible for being so upset with him and learned how to be patient. He realized why I was angry and was patient with me too. When he can take a step back and look at the big picture, you see how easy it is to work through the rough patches. 

There’s nothing wrong with therapy. You don’t have to have a ‘problem’ to go. I recommend counselling to everyone, regardless of their situation. 

Marriage is choosing each other every single day because you know in your heart that person is worth it. Sometimes, we make mistakes and marry the wrong person. It’s up to you now to decide whether she and your marriage is worth it."
AskDocs,fm302xf,t1_fm2zezg,1585709510.0,"He felt very energized in his brain, as if he had racing thoughts, but his body felt groggy. He starts out the day very energized and buzzing around but only by 5pm he’s exhausted and foggy. 

I do agree that the Adderall needs to be stopped. The Concerta seems like the best option as he was most functional on it, with the least side effects. We were able to have regular sex in the mornings, and late at night once the medication wore off. He struggled with the erectile dysfunction mainly during the day. We have been able to find strategic ways around that. 

I will do some more research on Strattera. I’m not sure if he wants to continue trying new meds, however. I doubt it.

So.... If he continues with the Concerta 36mg he will be the same as he was before. No side effects beside the erectile dysfunction but there are work-arounds. We discussed lowering the dosage but it will wear off sooner and then he’s foggy earlier in the evening. It seems that that’s the best option overall. I would prefer him to not be on medication at all, because I like to approach things naturally, but his behaviour and habits prior to meds was much worse."
AskDocs,fm2xexs,t1_fm2x9t8,1585707671.0,"The Concerta was giving him erectile dysfunction. The Adderall looks like a liquid capsule. It’s in a thin plastic capsule like an apple cider vinegar tablet would be.

His symptoms were pretty destructive to our marriage prior to starting Concerta. It also affected his work life and he got fired. He does want to continue on Concerta but not if it will cause the erectile dysfunction.

I do agree that it can be managed naturally but he really loves the way he feels with Concerta."

Marriage,ffalzki,t3_esex39,1579739074.0,"I honestly have no idea how I’d be able to continue a marriage with someone after that. He willingly took it further.

I believe we have some control over who we love. When he started to feel anything at all, he could have cut that woman completely out of his life and pretended that she didn’t exist. He could have focused on better things, like the marriage and the kids and his career. He could have travelled for a while with you. Maybe the feeling would have faded, maybe not. And before people attack me for my controversial opinion, I’m NOT saying we can completely control our feelings. We CAN, however, control how we respond to them. He made the conscious choice to continue seeing her and allowing it to develop into a sexual relationship. 

From this point on, you might find yourself constantly wondering if he’s thinking about her. You’ll wonder about where he is anytime he’s out late. You won’t be able to fully trust him again. Even if you choose to stay with him, it will never be the same. Do you want to live like that? Or allow yourself to find love elsewhere that nourishes you and makes you feel invincible? You deserve love, happiness, and respect. No matter what happens, you’ll be okay. If you are alone where you live because of the move, you’ll meet new friends and start over and find beauty in the little things. Maybe you will discover a talent for cooking you never knew you had. Maybe you’ll read more and learn new languages and discover what you love. Karma is real and the universe will always find a way to balance out. No matter what happens, you’ll be okay."
