tarot,fr3et9q,t1_fr3dpp0,1589855875.0,"i actually did this. i got five cards. the knight of pentacles which i interpreted as the spread saying “there’s in issue with your relationship but it’s not your partner”, then the star inverted, which i saw as “you need to learn to let go and move on, you can’t be angry forever”, which at that point became very clear to me that this is in fact about my mother. i live with her and she’s very strict about what my partner and i can and can’t do. on top of this, we’re also tiptoeing around her because i’m trans and my partner and i are gay. she doesn’t know any of this.


the hierophant appeared in a future position so i saw it as the culmination of the things i want most. a psychology degree, and a completed transition. this takes time, effort, and hard work. the seven of pentacles kind of reinforced the inverted star by saying “there’s no way to fix your relationship with your mom so just forgive and forget”, and finally the five of cups inverted basically said i need to stop focusing on all of the negative and look at what i do have instead of what i don’t. 


the nine of swords probably represents my broken relationship with my mother that tends to leak into and jeopardize every aspect of my life. the nine probably represents that i’m really close to being at a point where i can finally leave and be done with her."

usually you can tell you have a dry scalp if you have excessive dandruff even when your hair is clean. my scalp was dry as hell when i went through puberty but it calmed down a few years ago. hope this helps!

she explicitly stated to me that i am the only guy she’s ever been attracted to and it wasn’t because i was AFAB (we never wound up having sex due to personal issues relating to that area on both ends). she didn’t tell anyone else because she felt it was none of their business. we actually kept most of our relationship private for the same reason.


she identified as a lesbian despite dating a guy because of how rare of an occurrence it was. it wasn’t enough to change her label because suggesting that she’s bi would imply that she is attracted to men a lot more often that she is. to this day i am the only man she has ever been attracted to.


to put it bluntly, sexuality isn’t always rigid. straight people, on rare occurrence, can be attracted to the same sex and still be straight. gay people, on rare occurrence, can be attracted to the opposite sex and still be gay. it’s not your relationship, it’s none of your business. don’t worry about it. if her boyfriend doesn’t like it, he can sort it out himself."
