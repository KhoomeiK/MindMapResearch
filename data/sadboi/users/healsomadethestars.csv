Christianity,fj9kynu,t3_fc95cn,1583152288.0,"The above comments have all come from a standpoint that God doesn’t directly speak to his people anymore. That’s a legitimate viewpoint to hold, but it’s not the only one (and nor do I think it’s the correct/best interpretation of the bible).

How do I hear God’s voice? I don’t consider myself to have a strong prophetic gift, but I’m continually learning to distinguish God from my own thoughts. Here are some general principles I follow:

1) If it contradicts what God has said in Scripture, it’s not God. God is consistent, and Scripture is the most authoritative (though I don’t believe only) revelation of God’s will and purposes.

2) Sometimes it “sounds different” in my head from my normal internal voice. Can’t explain it anymore than that! 

3) Equally sometimes a thought just pops into my head, with no discernible logical progression of thought leading up to it (e.g talk to that person on the street). I can be thinking about something entirely different and mundane and the thought just completely intrudes. 

4) Especially true if God is speaking in a public setting such as church, often God says the same or similar thing to multiple people and there is a sort of confirmation in that. Had this last Sunday where myself and the guy behind me got exactly the same scripture to share with someone, and then the same ‘picture’ later on in the service. We were both encouraged by this.

If I feel God is speaking to the congregation in a church service (my church expects and leaves space for this), I check whatever I think I’ve heard in with those leading the service - and they decide whether to share it or not. This kind of thing is only properly done in community - someone standing up and saying “this is what God has said” is open to all kinds of abuse - it requires humility on the part of the hearer to accept that they might be mistaken, and to submit what they think they’ve heard to the discernment of others in the community.

I would encourage you to practice asking God to speak, and listening. Not all of what comes into your head will be God, but I believe that God loves to speak to his people, especially when they are eager to hear his voice as you are. My two most important points from above are to test everything against scripture, and be prepared that you may (and probably will!) be mistaken at times, so receive and give anything you hear with humility."

I’m personally struggling with suicidal thoughts, and that level of detail can be unhelpful for me, and I imagine for some others.

Christianity,fivbhc1,t3_f9oydx,1582757382.0,"Charismatic Evangelical here - I believe in prophetic words, but I do also think you’ve experienced other people misusing ‘them’ (scare quotes because it’s doubtful whether what they said was from God, despite what I’m sure were good intentions.)

My number one rule is to never present what I think God has said as authoritative, the churches I’ve been in have always taught that you must always present prophecies tentatively and leave it up to the recipient to weigh it and decide whether it is true or for them. I’m never offended if it’s not because I get things wrong, and I’ve received my fair share of prophetic stuff which has been *way* off. For me, scripture is authoritative, not my imperfect ability to hear God and accurately interpret the meaning.

I’m also SUPER cautious (to the point where I probably wouldn’t ever share it with the person) about any prophecy about someone getting married or having a baby. I would also be very cautious about anything to do with illness/healing. These things have the potential to do way more harm then good, and it could potentially destroy somebody’s faith to prophecy something they’re deeply longing for which then doesn’t end up happening. If I ever felt like I heard something like that I would maybe tell my church leader, if other people had heard something similar then that might be something worth sharing, and I also trust him to do it very sensitively and carefully.

Honestly, sounds like you’ve had some bad experiences and I think you rightly are recoiling from what I consider to be bad practice. As much as you’re able to, try not to throw the baby out with the bathwater as I think that when used wisely prophecy is a great encouragement to the church and an important spiritual gift.

Bless you!"
TrueChristian,fijfmto,t1_fije0pf,1582445771.0,"I’ve just replied to another comment above, but I’m choosing to do so again so that the person who you’ve replied to sees another perspective.

I strongly disagree with your claim that the Bible explicitly states that sexual orientation is ‘clearly a choice’/something that we have conscious control over. You’ve also stated how clear scripture is on this matter multiple times without ever providing evidence. We all experience sinful desires, sexual or otherwise, and we are called to flee from them by not acting on them or indulging them. I know of many faithful Christian men and women who experience same sex attraction yet fight hard for holiness and sexual purity by remaining celibate and saying no to romantic and sexual relationships. Some of them have written incredibly helpful books to help those going through the same fight and for those of us who want to know how we can beat support and care for our brothers and sisters who experience attraction to the same sex but want to live a life of holiness before God."
TrueChristian,fijf6bx,t1_fijdrj7,1582445210.0,"To clarify, I hold a traditional (non-affirming) view in sexuality, but I don’t agree with you that the bible addresses whether or not we choose our sexualities, or that one can simply change who they are attracted to. Could you provide the passages you have in mind to support these claims?

Rather, whether we are gay or straight we are called to present our bodies as living sacrifices, and live a life of holiness, including/especially in matters of sex. Those who are married are called to faithfulness and mutual self-giving to their spouse. Those who are unmarried, whether because they are same sex attracted and therefore cannot marry in the sight of God  whether they are attracted to the opposite sex but have not found a person to marry, or are called to singleness, the calling on them is to faithfulness in the form of celibacy.

I don’t think anybody consciously chooses their sexuality, it (and we!) are way more complicated than that."
Christianity,fii5o7u,t1_fii2y35,1582417687.0,"I don’t think that any of those passages either support your point or push against mine.

Christianity,fii16q3,t1_fihuzzn,1582416193.0,"Tbh, it feels like you’re trying to get me to walk into a trap by putting words in my mouth. I didn’t deny either of those things, I just said that the 1
Corinthians 12 body metaphor isn’t capable of supporting the weight of the doctrine you’re trying to hang off it, namely that there’s biblical reasons to pray to dead Christians/petition them to intercede for us. 

Are we alive in Christ? Yes, though many have fallen asleep. If Paul’s happy to make a distinction between living and dead Christians without compromising on Christian unity, then so am I. It also seems pretty clear that Paul doesn’t have Christians who have died in Christ in mind when he wrote 1 Corinthians 12. Those who have died, cannot suffer, for example. Basically, I don’t think that chapter is relevant to this discussion!

Paul never instructs the church to pray to Christians who have died, or himself petitions any of the early Christian martyrs to intercede for him or the church from heaven. He does however ask living Christians to pray for him. Without any solid biblical reasoning or precedent, I think it’s best to stick with what Jesus taught and the NT writers modelled; praying directly to the Father through the Son in the power of the Spirit, and asking fellow living Christians to do likewise."
Christianity,fihugpq,t1_figssrz,1582414256.0,I think that reasoning is a stretch. Paul used the rich theological metaphor of the body to correct the church in Corinth in their practice of the Lord’s supper. He’s not making a statement of whether dead Christians can intercede for us. To extrapolate to that conclusion is to go beyond authorial intent.
depression,fialysq,t3_f7b9r6,1582303786.0,"What a brave thing to do! (That sounds patronising, but I mean it with all sincerity.) massive well done and I hope they start helping you feel better soon."
depression,fiaa1y5,t3_f791jw,1582296615.0,"I also feel you. I’ve found it really helpful to remember what depression is and isn’t (at least in my understanding - I have no medical or psychological training, just going off my own experiences). Feeling sad/down/some other negative emotions are a natural part of life and actually help us navigate the world. Sad/scary/other negative things happen in life and feeling negative emotions is a normal and helpful response. If my feelings correspond to the reality of what’s going on, I’m not too worried that my overall mental health has taken a downward spiral. It’s when my feelings don’t match whats going on that I take special note and maybe start to think about where I can find support if I need it. 

When my metal health was at its lowest point, I barely felt anything at all. Good things didn’t make feel good, sad things didn’t make me feel sad etc. Spent more of the time feeling numb - but negative feelings were easier to access so I would deliberately dwell on things of try and make myself feel awful, just so I could feel something. I now understand that pattern of thought as being something akin to emotional self harm, I had CBT (as well as being on meds) and it massively helped break the cycle. As I started feeling better, any kind of feeling was evidence that my mind was functioning better and my mental health was improving. Even negative feelings felt weirdly good, as I was able to see that they were appropriate responses to what was going on in my life.

Don’t know if that’s helpful for you OP, but mainly wanted to say that feeling down isn’t necessarily a relapse and so isn’t necessarily something to be scared of. If by relapse you mean that you’ve felt worse in the past but are currently feeling better then it sounds like you will have learnt lots about yourself and your mood, so even if you do have something of a relapse you’re in a much stronger position to manage it well, know how to help yourself and how to ask for help.

Hope you’re doing okay :)"

depression,fhs0jw7,t3_f4ks6o,1581847750.0,"Christian here. I agree with you on how unhelpful it is when “seeking Jesus” is presented as a magic cure to depression. Staying close to Jesus hasn’t healed my mental illness (but it has given me hope, comfort and put me in a very supportive community, so I am grateful for it!)

I also agree that an eternal afterlife with our minds as they are now would be horrid. I wouldn’t want that either. Personally I believe that there’ll be full healing of both body and mind - it’ll be like it was before the fall with no illness or pain. These are my beliefs and I don’t expect you or anyone to feel better because of what I believe, but just wanted to put another view out there!

I really hope you get better way before you come to find out whether there’s anything waiting for us after we die. Sorry if this comes across as trite, but it does happen, people do get better even if that’s currently unimaginable. Lots of love in the meantime. xx"
Christianity,fhr2j0i,t3_f4fzpj,1581815662.0,"Hiya,

I don’t have lots to say, and very few answers for you, but thanks for being open and honest about how you’re feeling. You’re going through some really tough things and reaching out is always difficult and brave, even if it’s just on reddit. Lots of people on here will be praying for you.

This won’t solve everything, but is there a reason why you’re not currently going to a church? Sounds like you could do with being in Christian community and having people around you to love you and care for you. Lots of people on the comments have expressed different beliefs about being a gay Christian, your post sounds like you believe that being a Christian and being sexually active in a gay relationship are incompatible. If so, I’d recommend going to a church which shares that conviction - and can therefore help and support you to live the life that you believe God is calling you to live. A note of caution though, I’d be wary of a church which says that *being* gay itself is sinful - I personally don’t think that is a helpful (or correct) way at looking at something as complex as sexuality. Straight or gay, we’re all sinners and we all carry the consequences of the fall in all areas of life, including our sexualities. We all equally need God’s forgiveness and mercy, and we all are equally undeserving of it, yet God gifts it to those who love him, straight and gay alike. 

All this is to say that we’re not designed to do life on our own, God’s design is for us to be in community. And it’s his kindness to us that we don’t have to carry these burdens on our own. Community is where we find love, acceptance and can be assured of God’s love for us and his mercy when we are tempted to forget it. (Unfortunately community is also made up of sinful people who don’t always act perfectly, so you will need to also have grace and forgive others.
!)

It’s not easy to open up to new people, but I hope that you find someone who can pray with you and start helping you work through your struggles. Suicidal thoughts are scary, please do tell someone that you’re experiencing them, even if you don’t feel ready to come out. Try and make sure that you’re immersing yourself in the truth of what God says about you in Scripture. You are loved, you are so valuable that Christ chose the cross for you, you are accepted just as you are, you are given the Holy Spirit to empower you to live a Christian life, you are becoming more and more like Christ each day. God will never forsake you.

God bless you, brother."
Christianity,fhqxios,t3_f4heqt,1581813074.0,"I can’t know exactly what you’re going through, but some of what you’ve described resonates with my own experience of not wanting to keep living because I just couldn’t see any hope for the future being better. I was convinced that I’d always feel awful, and that the depression would never lift. 

I’ve not experienced full healing yet, but I’m not in that desperately dark place anymore. I couldn’t imagine things getting better, but they did. God was with me through it all, he kept me alive even when I prayed the prayer your asking for, he put people around me to care for me and he provided medical treatment too. Little by little, he restored the hope that was absent - not just hope for eternity with him in the life to come, but hope that there’s goodness and joy, purpose and meaning to be found in this life on earth. I didn’t think anything would ever change, least of all myself, but God promises that he does not leave us in our mess; he is with us, he rescues us and he works in us each day to make us more and more like Christ. There’s hope, even when you can’t feel it or it’s hidden by depression/other mental illnesses.

Today I’m glad that I’m alive. God hasn’t promised that the rest of my life will be easy, or even that I’ll be completely healed from depression this side of Jesus’ return. But God has the amazing ability to redeem even the worst of circumstances and transform them them to be for my good and his glory, because he loves me. And that’s hope that’s worth staying alive for. Whatever happens in my future, he’s promised that he will always be with me - he will never leave me nor forsake me.

OP, it’s probably very hard for you to believe that things will get better for you, and that’s a horrible place to be. But God is with you, he has not abandoned you, he loves you and he wants to bring you out from the pit and place you on solid ground. It might not happen overnight, but he’ll be with you all through the journey. For all those who follow Jesus, your life has been bought at a great cost - you are so loved and so incredibly valuable.

Please reach out to someone who can help you get some help and support. Your church or a church near you will hopefully be able to care for you and signpost you to relevant mental health services so you don’t have to carry this burden all by yourself. If you don’t feel able to keep yourself safe, please please tell someone who can help you keep safe, call a crisis hotline, go to a&e/emergency room.

Lots of people are praying for you here, you are deeply loved."
