mentalhealth,ew1mnb6,t3_cm3d5w,1565026727.0,"Sounds like alot of you are smoking too much. Weed can be used very effectively, but not if you get baked at any sign of panic. If you do a small amount in the morning or before bed, it's very benifical. Like anything, if you overdo it, it will go from being helpful to scary as fuck. Also, it heavily depends on the strains you smoke. Some will help alot, others will make it worse, and if you rely on it to be your savior, it will never work. I thought I could rely on it and that was the problem. You can't use it at every sign of trouble, because then you don't know how to handle anxious feelings without it and that messes you up. However, if you use it during only the worst depressive, scary or troubling thoughts, it will be very helpful. But it's hard to figure out your proper doseage, so if you do it, try micro dosing. Don't smoke a joint, smoke a small bong rip and it wont cure you, but it will help you. It's not the weed that's the problem, it's the fact that a lot of us have no idea we're smoking the wrong strains or just way too fucking much. I'd use it when I'd be a crying upset mess and after a while, I didn't even need to do that. So, maybe, if your able to not need it anymore, it helped you more than you realize and you just don't have the same need anymore.

Kreese is too proud to ask anyone for help, and seeing people as evil without trying to understand their motivations is what keeps this world in the dark ages. This show is trying to open people's minds not close them, if you were a fan you would have listened to the creators who clearly state this is not a black and white show. No one is evil, but it's very telling that you would rather label someone evil, then understand what made them make all the horrible choices you see as evil. They do not see it that way, and seeing them that way solves nothing. You have a lot to learn about balance, if your just watching the show so a bad guy takes a fall, your watching the wrong show. Everyone in Cobra Kai is neither evil or good, they are flawed human beings, and each one is trying to do the best they can, they stumble, and some make it even worse, but to deny their clear intentions while simply labeling them as evil, in reality, means your a very ignorant and in pain person.

I remember feeling like that as a kid, and it was due to my parents not having a good relationship with one another. It made my relationship with my Dad very strained, and so I often felt neglected, and would act out for the attention. She's choosing a male, so while it could seem creepy in a Leon The Professional kind of way, the reality is that she most likely doesn't feel close to her dad. Kids do strange things, because they really don't understand or get adult interactions, especially those who may be autistic and higher on the spectrum. People like that, have difficulty regulating emotions, commucating, understanding boundaries and limits. It's good that she has you, because if she feels that way, somethings going on at home. It doesn't have to be evil or even real abuse, but if she does have a condition that they aren't aware of then without knowing or meaning to, they could be making it worse on her. She also seems to be terrified of you being taken away from her, which is why she would act a certain way around other women around you. Unless she has suffered sexual abuse, it's highly, highly, unlikely for her to be interested in you in any way that would be creepy, she most likely feels that your the only one who really cares.

But, if she is speaking like that, she is learning it from somewhere. Threatening to hit, or throw something is what a child would do, but threatening to shoot someone, does show signs that something is very wrong at home.

EtikaRedditNetwork,eu8m9y2,t3_cf5b8b,1563559891.0,"It's a shame that his fans clearly care more about him, than his own family did. His father is a wealthy politician, and could have really helped his son. People are quick to tell the families, it wasn't your fault. I'm sorry, but that isn't true. This dude had a bright spirit, and all he needed was support, where was his family during all this? People in his position don't feel like they can reach out, it's the families job to pay attention to their kids. And when your kid live streams a swat team breaking in due to a suicide threat, that's when you drop your shit and be there for your kid. We want to comfort these families too much, I'm sorry but, I'm really not sorry, too many kids like Etika are dying. 29 is barely an adult, he was a kid, he had so much to do and see. Mental illness is not always a families fault, more often then not they are the contributing factor, but that isn't something to be guilty for. Failing to be there and intervene is something you should feel guilty for. When we say there is nothing that could be done, we are telling a comforting lie that results in tradegy. Deaths like these could be avoided if more parents knew how serious this is. No matter who you are, what you look like, what you do, how you behave, everyone is at risk of one bad day becoming one too many. Most of us persevere, but some of us need help, some won't accept help easily, but if you give up trying, that is on you. Blaming the mentally ill does no good, saying there is nothing that could be done is a lie, and Etika would still be here if someone close to him cared as much as so many of you do. So next time a loved one seems like they might be struggling, don't give up on them, even if they act like an asshole, people struggling are breaking inside, and sometimes you get cut picking up the pieces, but you still have to pick them up, you may be the only one who can."
mentalhealth,etm86he,t3_cc5hp6,1562954149.0,"I see people condemning the op because her posts from months ago involve drugs. Drug use is a sign of mental illness, and given that this is the first post in a few months I'd say it's quite possible it's true. The Mentally ill are rarely believed, they are often blamed for their issues, when nine times out of ten it's the parents fault. Don't give me the, you did all you could and it's just not their fault crap. It is a parents job to guide and teach, if you have a mental illness and they did not help you, that it is them, plain and simple. We often lay the blame at the feet of those seeking help, we blame those who have felt rejected by the world, and say why did you not seek help? Because even if this story isn't true, it still happens everyday to others. So why couldn't this story be true? Because she talked about drugs in her past, because the story seems strange to you? None of those are reasons to discredit her story. Also to the morons saying it was just reverse psychology... You know tough love and reverse psychology has its merits, but telling someone to go ahead and do it never will have merit. It's ok to say because they most likely won't? Yea and what if saying that caused it to happen, oh they would have done it any way right? This is why the mentally ill cannot get help, they are made to feel so guilty and responsible that they just give up. A mental illness is an illness, and if your parents did not properly assist you they are to blame. Think of it this way, if a five year old gets diabetes, and the parents keep feeding him sugar and never teaches him to eat properly, what is going to happen when they are an adult? We need to stop babing the parents, they are the ones more in need of tough love than the mentally ill."

Wake up, your skin color does not give you a right to murder and pillage. America did not belong to us, and we killed to take it, you're trying to make a logical explanation for why genocide is ok. Anytime you murder a native people to take their land through force, that is genocide and your ignorance can't change that. There is no revision to history, there is the fact that you were raised to think Natives got what the had coming, and that is sick. Oh becasue we wanted the land more we had a right to it? What about slavery bet that was reasonable too huh? This is why whites are still evil, you can't accept the crimes of your ancestors, so you double down and commit your own racist crime by covering up theirs. There is no justification for invading and taking land through force. There was no legal right for us to do that, what right did we have to this land? None, it was there's and we did not want to share it with them peacefully. We wanted it all, and we wanted them out of the way. Now I know you don't give a shit, so don't flatter yourself and think I took the time to write this for you, I took the time so others would see the truth and not just your backwards lies.

The jokes are subtle, and if your aware that the subject matter is closer to reality than most would like to think, then it comes off more horrific than funny. But, that is also how extreme dark humor works, which is something that only American Dad does to these extremes. It's not better than South Park, but the satire is in the same level, but when American Dad goes dark, then fucking go there. Roger has murdered a baby, Stan was given a lobotomy, Roger murdered Millionaire Matt Davis, the show has gone to the rapture, Stan, Roger, Jeff and Steve have died in some capacity at some point, a few times. It's a dark show, but the darkest parts generally have a pretty smart point with them. We laugh at Stan having his brains turned to scrambled eggs, because it's done in a over the top manner, and that's often the best way to raise awareness about a topic no one seems to care about. My video goes into further detail, but I'm not such a whore that I wouldn't give bullet points since you gave such an awesome response."
IntotheDarkHulu,etaphlz,t1_eta0c5c,1562625815.0,"That is really cute, I think you should do the same. I cannot fathom how someone can ignore the wrongs done by this country and our government. American could be and should be great, we have the greatest ideas in the world, it is a shame that is all they are. You can speak of all the good things whites have done while ignoring all the wrongs. Who invented racism? I am pretty sure black people did not enslave us, make us feel worthless and then act like we should be grateful that we aren't being lynched anymore. Just because it is not as bad as it once was, does not mean it is better. Considering most of the world acts as you have, if you're the model for sanity, then I am perfectly happy being out of my fucking mind. Your insults are so weak and pathetic, I state facts and you speak out of your ass. People like you do this all the time, you treat those who see the insanity in our world for what it is, like we're crazy, because you just want to shut us up. You want to stay comfortable, you want to ignore everything that is wrong instead of doing something about it. Only a very guilty, and selfish human acts like that, yes the racism does not affect your life, so why should you care that it is a very real problem affecting others. People like you would rather try to make people who care, think they are crazy for caring, you would rather shame someone for caring because you are not capable of caring. All people like you can do, is stand arrogant and hope your confidence will deter those who wish to fix the issues you enable. What happens when people like me stop getting set off by people like you, and just keep telling it like it is? What happens when we run out of anger and pain, and understand all we can do is fight your misinformation and hate, with our love and knowledge? Because it is happening right now, you think I take the time to write all this for you? Do you think I am actually trying to get through to you? Man, to be that arrogant, to be that self-centered. See if you had shut up, people might have sided with you, expect all they see now, is your fear due to my words. Really, it's due to my intelligence, oh am  I not supposed to feel as confident and cocky as you do? People like you are so used to us being set us so easily, your so used to just being able to use insults and bullshit to make the other person get so upset, that they look crazy by comparison, this is how racists keep control. IT is why we have to learn to stop being offended by your words and stand up and explain in greater detail than your tiny brain can handle, just how wrong you are. People like you keep trying to shut us up, and the best you can do is personal attacks and insults, without any facts to back up your lunatic claims. Tell me, how many Black CEO's are in America, tell me why Flint does not have clean drinking water, tell me why Black people are shot for holding cellphones, while white people can argue and scream at cops without being shot? Tell me why a black kid is shot for wearing a hoodie, and a white kid can shoot up a school and come out alive and well? Well, we're all waiting... See racism does not have to be slavery, it does not have to be foul words, racism is labeling one man a thug and the other a human being worthy of help. So, why don't you keep making yourself look stupid and I'll keep stating facts and logic, we can let Reddit decide who is right and wrong."
IntotheDarkHulu,et9zy93,t1_et9zay0,1562609117.0,"I'm pretty sure you're the lunatic, I'm speaking of facts and information, and your speaking out of some seriously angry emotions. I'm not shaking as I type like you, I also don't think I'm any kind of knight, again that seems to be more reflective of your self arrogance. Also, everything I stated can be Googled and found to be true. Your stating your opinions as if they are facts. Black people don't need whites to save them, they just would like some people to care as much about them as you care about your race. You can say what privilege does not exist all you want, that doesn't make it true. How many black CEOs are in America, how many of our major movie stars are black? How many black people are suffering in flint due to your ignorance and arrogance? A state of mostly black people, and we don't see the need to give them clean drinking water. Not all whites are evil, some are just ignorant, arrogant and blind like you. You can't take the ideas that maybe some whites are evil, and given your responses and attitudes, it's damn sure evident why the notion that some White's are racist and evil, just hit a little to close to home for you. So sorry about that, maybe see a Dr about your anger issues? You can't read facts without getting so tightly wound up, I know it's uncomfortable information, but come on buddy, don't make this so easy on me."
IntotheDarkHulu,et9ym63,t1_et9q1fu,1562608274.0,"Maybe you should check the color of my skin before you show your arrogance and racism. Blacks are gunned down by cops for the color of their skin, we put children in cages, we perform modern lobotomies on the mentally ill against their will, we have veterans of all colors living on the streets, we have families living on the streets, people in flint don't even have drinking water! But yes, it's a great country. Also if you haven't figured it out, I am white moron, I just don't ingore the crimes of my people. Why not check your history books, white people are responsible for more death, mayhem and suffering than any other race, statistically, and the reason for that is white oppression. America could be great, but then we have ignorant fools like you who refuse to admit your privilege. I use my privilege to shine a light on atrocities that you and your friends would rather be buried. Not all whites are bad, but until we all accept the fault of our ancestors and our heritage, then we won't be better, we will be worse. We do not sweep crimes under the rug, if your white and not a racist, then you better educate yourself fast, becasue your on the slippery slope. Also, since I know you will deny most of what I said, I encourage the rest of you to do some simple research and not be led by a fool who assumes that I'm black because I hate white privilege and racism."
southpark,et8m6cg,t3_cabpw0,1562560946.0,"South Park is a far deeper show than most give it credit for. As the song goes, ""Off to the movies we shall go, where we learn everything that we know, because the movies teach us what our parents don't have time to say."""
IntotheDarkHulu,esyt112,t1_esxr0d1,1562348990.0,"Maybe if you understood the history of this country you would agree. Our nations independence was won with blood, it is land stolen through genocide. That is worth celebrating? This country is built on the bodies of native and African Americans, we act as if America is great for it's riches, it's not. This country is a disgusting sham, we parade for freedom, while denying it to every American who isn't white or rich. America is based in the idea of equality, freedom and compassion... Something this country has never practiced. We killed those who we thought did not deserve our dream, we enslaved human beings to make our dreams come true, we subject those with nothing to a life of suffering and agony, that sounds like the American Dream to me. A dream of greed, a dream of excess and where only the privileged decide what becomes of the underprivileged. Wake up, America has never been great, it could be, the ideas are there and if we made them a reality, who knows, maybe we could celebrate the Fourth, but if people like you keep sweeping the real issues under the rug, just so you can stay comfortable, then I'd say it's time you were subjected to the same hardships you thrust on others. How can we be a country based in freedom, when we erect walls and throw children in cages for seeking that freedom? You think it's ok to advertise this potentially amazing country, then tell all those suffering who are looking for our dream, fuck you, you can't have it, it's our dream and your job is to suffer to make it reality for us."
