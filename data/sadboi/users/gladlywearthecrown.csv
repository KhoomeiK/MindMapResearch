CPTSD,evfjklq,t3_cjn0mi,1564496726.0,"It is actually therapeutic to read. I have to thank you, knowing you're doing so well helps me be at peace too.

Fingers crossed for your therapy tomorrow. I think you're ready to take it on."
CPTSD,evfiban,t3_cjcuc8,1564496212.0,"Is it easier for you to figure out your feelings when you imagine talking about them with your therapist? That's pretty interesting. 

And, yes, I have, all the time. I found fair specialists, in the end, so I know who I can work with. At least, there's that."
CPTSD,evfgtnd,t3_cjg8hg,1564495551.0,You have no idea how happy it makes me.  Just knowing that there was a child in distress and she was allowed to feel it all and move on. That is so healthy. That is so good.
CPTSD,evfgbz5,t3_cjdgf6,1564495297.0,This is amazing and I'm so happy for you. You're doing so well and I'm glad you've got such a caring boyfriend.
mentalhealth,evav1nt,t3_cj32jp,1564358016.0,"This must be so hard for you. I'm sorry you have to struggle with it all.
I find that doctors that aren't specialists don't know how to handle mental disorders well. They often don't take it seriously or just assume that you're totally nuts.
I know how it is. And I'm scared you'll hurt yourself soon. Is there a place you can see a psychiatrist if you say it's an emergency? Because it sure is."
depression,evaiao9,t3_cj0i17,1564348403.0,Happy birthday. I'm sorry people ignored you. I wish you all the best.
fantasywriters,evaboaq,t3_civajj,1564343719.0,"This is the story of ""The Black Company"" series by Glen Cook, though critically not from the Big Bad's POV. So I think it's worth writing and you can go with it. That being said, read Cook's books, they were a big hit not for a lack of reasons and also you wouldn't like to write the same thing by accident."
ptsd,ev5peb7,t3_cihlxz,1564237075.0,That's amazing. I'm so proud of you.
ptsd,ev5p5wz,t3_cihm32,1564236984.0,I'm sorry they don't listen to you. I'm sorry they don't respect your wishes. I'm sorry they're proud of the soldier-you and not the human-you. I'm sorry they do it all the time. It must be so hard for you.
depression,ev5nvfp,t3_cihnz9,1564236497.0,That's fantastic. I'm happy for you.
depression,ev5l95p,t3_cihamt,1564235456.0,"Thanks for sharing this, you sound really honest. I'm sorry your last relationship ended badly and the current one is not what you'd like it to be. I think you work hard to deal with it all. I'm glad you saw specialists and took your time to get yourself together, that was a very brave and responsible thing to do.

I can't tell you if staying close to the new girl is good or bad for you, I don't know. You should talk this over with a therapist if possible. I just think you put a lot of genuine effort into respecting the boundaries set by that girl."

fantasywriters,ev0lsu6,t1_euxs4l9,1564141611.0,"Okay, let's do this - what about the hidden passageways? What do they look like? What can be found there? What do the automatons do while they're there? How do they behave when no one can see them? Do they posses some sort of intelligence? Do they clean only or maybe... borrow some items and hide them? Has anybody ever entered the passageways and lived to tell the tale?"
fantasywriters,euw81cg,t3_chmuwr,1564071972.0,"Your idea looks pretty solid to me at the moment. I think you should write your first draft, get some beta readers and then pull out your executioner's hood and kill some darlings when it's clear they don't work."
fantasywriters,euw5odk,t3_chn1se,1564070849.0,"Okay, why not both? You have that character you mentioned and the book starts off ""traditionally"". Then they realize something is off, maybe discover something by chance, see something they shouldn't have and decide to get to the bottom of this. They do so by intercepting documents because, for example, the really messed up stuff is happening far away and they can't witness it firsthand.

I think it opens up interesting possibilities. They can steal letters, rob high ranking guys, break into private rooms and offices to get reports and texts either not intended for the public or not yet censored.

This is a rough sketch of an idea and I don't know if it's to your liking.

&#x200B;

I don't think a handbook would work on its own. Maybe if it followed what you call a ""traditional"" book. Then you'd have a certain fanbase. Otherwise, publishers wouldn't risk publishing it, it'd be too dry and, I fear, boring for most people."
CPTSD,euvzw2m,t3_chl2oi,1564067813.0,"It's nice that you were able to understand better what happened to you. Thank you for telling us this story. I may use it in the future to explain cptsd.

&#x200B;

I hope you find a cozy place you can move out to."
ptsd,euvwr90,t3_chmpta,1564066630.0,"Thanks for the recommendation, I'll get it right away. I hope I learn something."
fantasywriters,euvtq6h,t3_chjyy6,1564065507.0,"I find your characters quite promising. I am, however, worried about your declaration that the plot would unfold slowly. Do you mean in each individual short story or is there one big overarching plot? Is it the same story told from multiple points of view?

It may take a long time to find answers to some questions or to get to the big reveal but the plot should always move forward. Please, don't let readers get bored.

I'm interested to see where you'll go with this world."
mentalhealth,euvlm5v,t3_chjq1f,1564062375.0,This is so good to see. I'm glad you found your way back to life. I'm so proud of you and the work you've done.
depression,euvjx70,t3_cheys1,1564061652.0,I know what you mean. You struggle with being criticized and soon you can't tell a difference between someone offering critique to help you better yourself and someone being cruel. You collect every criticism and carry it with you like a backpack full of stones. It's so hard to distance yourself from it. It takes so much work.
depression,euvhxoq,t3_chig8p,1564060841.0,I can only imagine how hard you have it right now. I'm so sorry your brother was taken from you.
depression,euvh727,t3_chk776,1564060552.0,It's terrible. They were wrong to laugh at you and I'm sorry it happened. It's hard to talk out loud about such painful experiences and you should be respected for it.
