Christianity,fain22z,t1_fail6v1,1576111832.0,"To me, alcohol (or any sin) got in between me and God and I turned to it more than I did to Him to make me feel better. Back story: that semester, the guy I really liked for about 2 years was getting married (and I went to the wedding) so I ~wilded out~ unfortunately. Honestly don't even remember how my spiritual life was at the time which isn't a good sign lol.

I definitely agree with you on the difficulty of opening up to church people. I'm from a community where gossip is VERY prevalent so I'm extremely extremely cautious about who I tell things to. But I do have two church friends who I've known for about a decade now and I find that they respect my privacy and give godly advice. Trust me, it is uncomfortable but the Bible also tells us that we need community in our lives (James 5:16) because we aren't meant to handle it all on our own. You need someone to confide in, who will also pray for you. If you know a potential guy from your church who you feel might help, you should get to know him more and see if you find you're able to trust him and also see if he gives biblical advice.

Take it from me, you DON'T want advice from your nonbeliever friends, they'll almost always lead you down the wrong path."
Christianity,faije4g,t1_faiiixc,1576109270.0,"“And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.”
Matthew‬ ‭5:30‬ ‭

If this is a sin you’re constantly struggling with, you need to cut off all access to it even if it means stepping away from dating. In the past I’ve struggled with alcohol (especially during the school year) and I would go out drinking all the time and I didn’t even realize it. I spent three months during the summer back at home without any access to it (or the people who led me to drink) and it helped. Of course I still struggle with the temptation of it, but I don’t act on it as much. If anything leads you to take action on your temptations, you gotta get away from it. 

Also try finding an accountability partner. Someone from your church or another Christian, if you’re not part of a church. 

Since you’re struggling with sex, I’d suggest following Jonathan Pokluda (pastor in waco, tx) on instagram as he has a lot of helpful insight for men struggling with sexual sin. He has a lot of good messages and books out there so I recommend him to everyone.

edit: his instagram is @jpokluda"

We were all lost once and enslaved to sin but the way we live after knowing and loving Christ is what matters."
