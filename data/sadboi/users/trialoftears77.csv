ptsd,etg8256,t3_cae5de,1562785592.0,"PTSD/CPTSD and BPD have significant overlap in symptoms, as they are mostly born from the same things and often co-morbid. CPTSD in particular can be almost indistinguishable from BPD.

There may be trust and abandonment issues with both, though fear of abandonment more heavily with BPD and at any time. With PTSD, fear of abandonment is not often a related symptom when things are good: it’s more often when re-experiencing trauma in a relationship context.

Self-injury (cutting etc.), only having been in brief but intense romantic relationships, history of many sexual partners, and difficulty in maintaining long-term relationships—including with friends and family—all lean more heavily towards BPD but, again, suicide/self-harm are an integral part of CPTSD as well.

Everything else can be about equally shared between PTSD/CPTSD and BPD, depending on the person, including suicidal thoughts and feelings, extreme anger, affect dysregulation, uncontrolled emotion expression, splitting, dissociation, changed or fragmented personality, and paranoid ideation, but not really delusional paranoia like that of psychosis (unless you’re experiencing psychosis and not dissociation.)

Those with BPD will split and gesture suicidally/self-injure over even objectively trivial things; PTSD will potentially split and may gesture suicidally when re-experiencing trauma. CPTSD does any of the symptoms of both that it wants following trauma.

Those with BPD tend to release their full fury instantly; with PTSD, especially CPTSD, there’s an initial feeling of loss of control over the self and the situation and unresolved anger can’t be fully expressed towards the self or the perpetrator until the trauma “ends.” Instant when wronged vs delayed.

Those with BPD rarely have any use for a person ever again once they’ve completely painted them black. Those with PTSD more often vacillate between hating/resenting someone who traumatized them and wanting to “make it work.” BPD can do this, too, but rarely for extended periods.

The most obvious tell it’s BPD, though, is a history of brief, unstable relationships and frequent shifting of best friends and favorite people; lacking permanence in sense of self, interests, hobbies; feelings of constant boredom and not being fulfilled, even when not experiencing any standard depression or dysthymia.

They’re treated with many of the same medications and therapies but the goals differ: with PTSD, resolving the trauma memory is the primary treatment goal; with BPD, resolving self-injurious/suicidal behaviors is the primary treatment goal. With CPTSD, well, both, as it’s really both.

This is as a general rule. There are, of course, always exceptions."

For me, it was kind of like exposure therapy, but instead of physically traveling to an uncomfortable location, you travel there mentally. I was doing it all the time anyway, so why not. 

OP, I do recommend therapy, as well as making your wife take joint responsibility in your recovery. Sorry doesn’t mean shit when there is this much damage and loss of trust. You should be allowed to take as long as it takes; you didn’t ask for this. 

If she doesn’t support you in healing and if she rushes you or pressures you to stop talking about it before you are ready, don’t allow that.

Research shows it takes years for a relationship to fully heal from infidelity, and the failure rate is extremely high when the unfaithful partner doesn’t do their part.

Don’t accept sorry. Demand more. This is not your fault. I’m so sorry you’re going through this.

Trite but a genuine apology has three parts:

I am sorry 

It is my fault

What can I do to make it right?

Bonus (#4): Actually following through with making it right

And, yeah, it’s an uphill battle. Decide if it’s even worth it. Someone completely ruined your psychological health to get off with a different set of genitals.

That doesn’t mean they don’t deserve forgiveness eventually, but you don’t have to stay to forgive. 

Realize this isn’t going away anytime soon, and few people who cheat are good enough to support you as long as you’re going to need to be supported.

If they do, and they are patient, and they accept these absolutely normal symptoms as a consequence of their actions, and are considerate in not causing additional unnecessary painful reminders, it can be worth working through, but you deserve every single one of those at a minimum.

Good luck."
Buddhism,ete3ocb,t3_catqcr,1562722120.0,"Often the happiness or unhappiness occurs during the journey to discovering whether a situation can or cannot be remedied, or in the wondering whether remedying it is possible while possessing the hope that it is and lacking the evidence it is not—these are answers often not initially apparent, or life would be much simpler.

SuicideWatch,etbigg2,t3_cat4o6,1562647943.0,"It can certainly feel that way, sometimes. Personally, this quote explains my feelings on the matter:

“The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation. During the minute that it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive, many others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear, others are slowly being devoured from within by rasping parasites, thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst, and disease. It must be so. If there ever is a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in the population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored. In a universe of electrons and selfish genes, blind physical forces and genetic replication, some people are going to get hurt, other people are going to get lucky, and you won't find any rhyme or reason in it, nor any justice. The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference.” —Richard Dawkins

This line of thinking can also be freeing: you’re not being punished for something, you are not “meant” to suffer, and you are by no means alone in your feeling of it being unfair. 

One of my volunteer jobs involves watching animals come into a strange place and be terrified and alone for a week or two before they ultimately have their lives ended, because they never had any real chance at life, through no fault of their own. They were born, suffered, and promptly died because no one had a place or time for them.

All I can do is improve their quality of life while I can. All you can do is do the same for yourself either by changing the way you see this as some kind of fate or, like me, finally finding some kind of small fairness and company in that this type of suffering is so rampant.

It’s okay to be angry; it’s okay to lash out at how unfair things are. Your observations are valid. I can’t promise things will get better. No one can, it’s just lies and platitudes and you deserve more than that. I can say that I hope things do get better, and I hope you experience at least some good fortune in life, and I hope you find more peace with the way things work than you have currently found.

I disagree with Dawkins that there is no justice or fairness: I believe the fact all life ultimately ends and is forgotten is quite just. That’s how I have found peace, and that is how I cope with experiencing and watching other life experience so much suffering."

What you can know is, even though it may have felt to her this was the last straw, anything could have ended up being the last straw and it is happenstance that you were involved at that time. I understand from personal experience the weight this places on you, and both of your feelings were valid, but you did not end her life. Don’t let this end yours.

Realize that she was unwell and suffering with extreme illness, have compassion for her suffering and grieve, but also forgive yourself for your mistakes. You can go forward and be more mindful of others’ mental states, how you treat them, and with a better understanding of mental illness if you feel you would like to atone for believing you let someone down, but you aren’t responsible for anything other than your own behavior and don’t need to atone for hers."

I’m glad to see the overwhelming support you’re getting for being angry about your wife doing something so terrible to you, and for leaving her. I’m glad you’re respecting yourself; all of these tens of thousands of people are right that you deserve better. Best of luck."
