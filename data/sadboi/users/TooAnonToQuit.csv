I dont think a father should be able to opt-out is the woman wants to keep it, just like they can't opt-in if the woman does want the abortion. Pick one or the other based on your beliefs but you can't have it both ways.

AskReddit,fb7te3t,t3_ebp6ak,1576598951.0,"There's a story I heard about toothpaste factory. A couple vendors complained they recieved an empty box or two with no toothpaste inside. They hired some engineers to fix the problem and they came up with a scale and device to remove the lighter empty boxes. This was going to be expensive though, and the factory decided they would just assign someone to check each box. This was a pain and no one really wanted the job to pick up each box for weight. Now this factory also had a lazy worker they couldn't fire, the boss's young nephew who wasn't taking his career seriously, and was known to take shortcuts. The factory wanted this guy out, so they gave him the tedious job of checking all the toothpaste boxes, figuring that he wouldn't last long and could get him to quit. Well,  after a couple weeks the boxes all went out and there were no complaints about empty tubes. They saw the nephew posted up in a lounge chair next to the conveyer with a book in his hand a fan to keep him cool, obviously not paying attention to the production line. ""He must be getting lucky."" ""His luck will run out soon."" But after another couple of weeks nothing. So they wanted to force his luck. They sent him empty boxes on purpose to try and get him fired. Even that didn't work. So finally they go to the boss and complain that his nephew has been lazy and not watching the line. The boss gets very angry because it's an important job. They all go down to confront the nephew. The boss sees just how lazy his nephew has been, sitting in his chair and just reading, and gets visibly angry. The boss starts going off on him but the nephew is ready. He asks ""But, has there been any complaints of empty boxes?"" The boss looks to the workers and they say ""Well, no. But we're pretty sure he sent out empty boxes, maybe he talked to the vendors."" So they call a couple vendors and they say their boxes have all been full, no empty boxes of toothpaste. At this point the nephew has been smirking non-stop so they finally ask him what he did. He explains ""I started by hand checking them all, the light weight gave away the empty boxes. So I set up this fan to blow the empty boxes off the conveyer belt."" The nephew got a promotion."
TheLastAirbender,fb4hkxb,t3_ebd96f,1576509111.0,"Azula's name means blue (Azule), which means they knew she would have blue flame just after birth. Now I could be wrong, but I don't think a new born is fire bending (if so that's terrifying). So how would they know to name her Azula? I think there are other genetic indicators because they did say she was named after her grandfather Azulon, who also had blue fire, and would pose the same problem of... being named at birth. 

So either:
1) Newborns can fire bend (doubt it)
Or
2) There are other genetic indicators that can predict a baby's blue flame.

worldpolitics,f9sepky,t1_f9sdq24,1575590984.0,"Like I said they're being removed. That means there's less to go around and more people looking for them. It isn't that easy to just ""get"" one. Say you're at a company that has 50 full-time positions, and they cut that back by half, and add 2 part-time positions for each. Now the company has 25 full-time positions and 50 part-time positions. They get credited for ""creating"" the net 25 jobs. Meanwhile, the twenty 25 employees who were laid-off are all looking for new full-time jobs. This is the general trend. Fewer full-time jobs to go around and more people looking."
worldpolitics,f9sbgw3,t3_e6l1t5,1575589123.0,"They ""create jobs"" by removing 1 full-time position, and replacing it with 2 part-time positions. They ""create a job"" each time they do this, and don't have to give benefits. Meanwhile, part-time workers have to get 2+ jobs to make ends meet and often dont have insurance or retirement savings. It makes me sick!"

dogs,f89plfm,t3_dzofx9,1574377237.0,Yes! This drives me crazy! My town is crazy like pretends there's no leash law. There's literally about a dozen dogs that just wander around. The number of times I've had to stop my car because a dog is literally shitting in the road is just absurd.  There's one near me that always crosses into the road when he sees me because he knows I slow way down. I'm trying to be more active and go for jogs but the dogs all want to follow me.It's crazy! I don't know how to change a whole town's behavior. I've started honking my horn at the dogs in the road to try and draw attention to them being in the road.

AmItheAsshole,f84uz0l,t3_dyryj5,1574261344.0,"NTA I stand by the ""half your age plus 7"" rule.  Your dad is 47, apply this rule and even give him the benefit of rounding down and the YOUNGEST he should date is 30. NOT 22 that is disgusting! She is 8 years younger than the mimimum. The guy your mom is seeing ""Scott"" is 68. Apply this rule to him and the Youngest he should date is 41. Your mom is 6 year over the minimum and in the clear."
