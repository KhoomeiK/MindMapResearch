It’s really hard being in quarantine and not spending all of your time on the internet, but maybe focus on some form of art or learning a new skill, something like that. I bought a hammock and it’s really helped me get away from my phone, 10/10 would recommend. Even if you can’t hang one outside, it’s fun to just swing around or take a nap. That’s pretty off topic but I hope you get my idea."
