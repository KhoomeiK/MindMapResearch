I hide my journals from him which had incidents where I cheated on him. But that was when I was a junkie and I've gone to rehab since... They told me not to mention it because past is past. And yes, I was with him even during the junkie phase. By space he means the time period where we dont text or call or basically stay in touch with each other.


We agreed to a minimal time in the morning and the night but I'm just not able to cos I'm obsessed with him."

depression,faqfmsa,t3_ea9h8q,1576302373.0,"I am afraid of appearing ""happy"" or even accepting that I CAN be happy in fear of losing people because I feel they'd think, ""Oh she's fine so she can fuck off now"". There's a part of me that feels that I should constantly be fucked up to have my companion with me to constantly have them supporting me and loving me.

Which is really been my thing for years now, until my therapist pointed it out to me. And yes, I also fear that people would think the depression just flew away if I smile... But no, that's not the truth."

The urge to kill myself grows more and more intense through every minute... I'm saying this to let you know that I understand what that feels like. I know the pain. I know how it is to not smile at yourself when you're searching for reasons to be happy, as you stare at the mirror.

But guess what? It's okay. It's okay. It will be fine. That's all I know. Someday, you'll be fine. You'll break this. You'll come out happy. And I will too. And we'll fist bump and be glad that this part of our lives is done. It might seem so difficult and suffocating... But it'll be easy. Here's a lot of love from my side."

I've lost a lot of people owing to my health too. But I'm not going to regret it because people come and go. Mental health comes first. It's the most important thing there is. I'm so happy that you're treating yourself with things that make you happy. It's not so bad that you're truly alone.
You'll find ways to make things work with your mind and people around you.
Just enjoy this day and celebrate with a smile. I'm here if you wanna talk. :)"
