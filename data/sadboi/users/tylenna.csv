AmItheAsshole,fgoo1k6,t3_ezh59r,1580978054.0,"NTA but I'd like to share this. Back in university I had a perinatal class (I'm a psyhologist) with a developmental psycohlogy professor and she told us about a case of hers similar to yours, where the mother selectively aborted one fetus from the triplets. Shecame to deeply regret her decision, she had nightmares about that one unborn baby for years and still didn't recover from it. These things can scar you, so be careful and prepare yourself with the help of a therapist before you make this decision. You absolutely have the right to do it, it's your body, your health, not your husband's, don't get me wrong, but be prepared before the procedure, it can be though later. Psychologically, in some level, aborting one fetus from 3 can be harder mentally than aborting a single pregnancy... the guilt is stronger I think."

But I learned a lot and I have a lit of experience with patients and my professional (and personal) opinion is that sharing shouldn't be normal in therapy. No, it's not a two-way street, it's not a friendship, it's a special relationship. What you feel is actually pretty common (the need to know more about your therapist), and it's important to talk about that, but the solution is not an oversharing therapist.

You can't help it, because it's not your fault, it's a mental problem which needs medication.

mentalhealth,fcnkn1g,t3_ei4pbq,1577813392.0,"I work at a psych ward, we have different wings, for serious and more self-sufficient patients. My opinion is that you only need hospital treatment if you are in a deep depressive episode or have serious anxiety which prevents you from daily task:  in these cases patients benefit from hospital stay, the doctor get their meds adjusted and they feel more safe in a protective environment, being temporarily separated from the outside world. (Edit: Of course, other kind of patients need hospital treatment as well, I meant that OP only needs it in the mentioned situations, regarding his/her current diagnosis.)

TLDR: In my experience, well-functioning patients with anxiety disorders rather suffer from the hospital stay, but in a more severe state (depression, daily panic attacks), it can be helpful (medication, constant supervision)."
