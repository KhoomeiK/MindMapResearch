MultipleSclerosis,fodes9d,t3_g6sdkk,1587683787.0,"Thank you all for your input! I have been having problems for the last few years but it's been hard because I had 3 kids in 2 years. I had been busy. Nursing all 3 for 2 years of it. Dealing with my own mental health struggles and healing from trauma. I started psych meds and attributed many symptoms to the meds. Then they thought it was low blood sodium from the meds. Then, maybe POTS. SOOO much overlapped. Then I had the stroke like episode where my whole left side felt like it was numb and it felt like warm saline running through it. I drove myself to the hospital and couldn't make the right words in the ER. (Which is usually something that happens with right sided strokes not left sided according to the doctor). After several CTs MRIs with and without contrast and over 14 vials of blood one of the days I was there, I was hoping for more than, ""I think it's MS. We'll do a repeat MRI in 4 months"" 

As I sit in the waiting, I realized how much sense it all makes. I get this weird tightness in my ribs. I want to reach up into my ribs and push them out because it feels like I'm being crushed. In the last few months, I've rolled my ankle like 5 times, sometimes just standing there other times just walking on a flat surface. The electric pain. Crawling to bed because I'm so dizzy. The numbness/tingles. I thought I was crazy. And maybe it isn't MS, but at this point I think I would welcome it just to get answers."

I would strongly encourage therapy. You don't have to walk, sit down, and proclaim,""I sexually abused my brother!"". Go in and talk about your own abuse. Talk about forgiveness. Work on coping skills. And eventually maybe you'll be able to invite your brother in for a session. Maybe you both can heal. 

Find a therapist who you feel okay with,and don't be afraid to get a new one if the one you have isn't a great fit. I'm if the mind set that everyone should get therapy. Also, there are grants for individuals who have experienced abuse. No police reports are necessary for some of them. You don't have to name your abuser. You don't even have to talk about your abuse in session. 
Don't be afraid to reach out for resources in your area.

Because foreskin helps with lubrication and contains several specialized nerves that circumcision had removed, causing a loss of sensitivity. Not to mention that the glans becomes dry and calloused without the foreskin to protect it, again leading to desensitization. 
The foreskin is an organ that actually has multiple functions. It was taken away from him without his consent. I love him and I wish people hadn't cut part of him off. His parents decision has greatly impacted our sex life. His foreskin or lack thereof has no bearing on my affection for him. 

Also, he does wish things could be different for my body. He wishes my brain made the correct chemical cocktails so that I didn't struggle with mental health. He wishes my connective tissue wouldn't deteriorate, so that I wouldn't have so many continuing physical struggles. He wishes those things because he loves me. Nothing rude about it.

They are also both intelligent well read people. 

They had the opposite problem with my brother. They just wanted to help him. They did everything they could to do what they thought was helping and eventually turned to enabling. They swung hard the other way. They've just recently been able to let go and let him hit his rock bottom. He's sober over a year now and doing great. Tomorrow he gets unsupervised visits back with his kids. I couldn't be more proud of him. I can't say there haven't been times I was jealous or mad that he's gotten so much help (even before we all found out he was on drugs).

I was renting a room from them as really didn't have much ability to do shit. I was working at a roofing company at the time and would be gone for a couple days-2 weeks at a time. I didn't know they were moving. 
Then the job I had been hired for was over. Getting kicked out and having no job was just great on top of my untreated mental illnesses. I couldn't find a place to stay. I stayed with a friend for a while and then I had to go due to their own life circumstances. Then I was alone. I did get into a relationship, but I made a bad call and he beat the shit out of me and took my savings (hence the neighbor lady letting me go with her when our houses were sold). 

From the moment I left me apartment to the day I got keys to my new place was august-the next October. . . So 14 months? 

My parents thought I just needed to figure it out. Pull myself up by my bootstraps. They didn't understand trauma, PTSD or mental illness. My parents were born in 48&59.

When our landlord sold our places out from under us, she refused to let me fall back into homelessness and we moved in together. Moving my stuff into storage for a while is where I met my current SO. He rented me my storage unit and here we are.

You can shower at truck stops. A lot of truck stops give free shower tickets with so many gallons of fuel and truckers will sometimes give them to you for nothing. There are often community dinners at churches so you can get at least one meal a day. And you can also collect cans for extra money. Or do odd jobs. Honestly, my biggest hurdle was transportation and making sure I don't ""look"" homeless. I managed to get more than one job while homeless. 
It's not easy or fun and my experience isn't everyone's experience. But I came out of it.

Edit to add
I was out on my own before I became homeless. I was functioning and working and doing fine. Through a chain of events, including wrong place wrong time, poor choice of company, and my own mental health struggles  I became homeless. I wasn't doing drugs, I wasn't kicked out. Things just fell apart all at the same time. 
My parents thought they were helping me. They had no concept of mental health struggles and PTSD. I had no tools to deal with my trauma and no healthcare to gain those tools.
