AskReddit,fozaq99,t3_ga8ey3,1588187512.0,"I commonly sign off my messages to my students peace out Girl Scouts (or peace out Boy Scouts) and my fifth grader messaged me in Class Dojo “see you later alligator” and it was just the sweetest thing. We had a Magic School Bus watch party the other day and the kids who showed up were really into it. I’m working with some of them on narrative writing and their stories are so good, one of my students chose Ida B. Wells to write about! Very cool to give them a creative outlet when they’re stuck at home. 

I’ve been most excited about teaching science. The science curriculum can be difficult to teach because it’s so fast paced and we never really talk about it’s importance. We do a lot of hands on activities, but we never ask “Why even bother exploring space?” and other questions like that. I work at a school where I’m not supposed to plan my own lessons, but I’ve been given free reign here, and we have watch a lot of amazing videos, play games, and this Friday we are doing a virtual field trip to Mars!!!! To MARS!!! 

The best thing overall is seeing how seriously my lower students have taken this. I have a student who stays on for three hours every day with me and he is doing so much better with the smaller group instruction. I am getting to know them better. 

It’s my first year teaching and I was getting destroyed from the inside out. I loathed the profession before Christmas break even hit. I teach at a very tough school. But I actually get to teach now. I get to see how excited they get when they understand something. I get to watch them enjoy their work. This has changed my impression of teaching. I’m having a great time. I wish more students logged on, it’s very difficult to get them to do their work. But other than that, I’m very thankful for this opportunity to fall in love with this job."

relationship_advice,fo3j5ep,t3_g5bk4l,1587487774.0,"I don’t think anyone had mentioned this, but this is addict behavior. Addict behavior is very selfish behavior, and the “I need to have this NOW” is the default setting of addiction. Going to several stores and not settling for going without (like the hot dog sticks) is addict behavior. 

I have a food addiction and I see myself in this post, although I’m self aware enough to be secretive (also not healthy) and... not leave the house in a fucking pandemic. I order my shit online 🤙🤙🤙 ahaha kill me. But that’s beside the point. Spending is another part of it. It brings a lot of joy. That joy is empty.

I don’t want to say “break up with her, she’ll never change,” but that’s a possibility if she doesn’t get help. I also don’t want to diagnose some random woman I’ve never met, I’m just telling you what I see from my own experience. Whatever it is, it sounds like she is deeply unhappy inside and this is how it’s manifesting. If she’s open to help, then maybe this is salvageable (although you might need therapy too, enabling/codependency can be real even with food addiction, and the resentment you understandably feel is not going to be conducive to repairing the relationship). If she isn’t, she can’t be in a relationship right now and she needs this wake up call for her own health. This is self harm. It will ultimately be suicide.

Also: fuck everyone who is being extraordinarily shitty about someone who is clearly struggling. Calling her fat and making fun of her is shitty. There’s a lot of misunderstanding about obesity and food addiction — it is a mental illness. She is being horrible to OP and it’s not OP’s responsibility to put up with it, but you are not being helpful to the issue at all."

Your head is pounding and you’re gonna die as soon as reading begins, but you were laughing and running around ten minutes ago at recess? 

If I say yes to every request, no one is ever going to learn anything. You have to set boundaries with children.

Routine:

I used the Shea moisture low porosity shampoo for my scalp. Put a lot of Kinky Curky Knot Today in my hair, let it sit for five minutes while I finished showering. Then squished to condish or however you call it. After squishing I scrunched in more Knot Today as leave in (quarter sized), prayer handsed some Shea Moisture Coconut Hibiscus Smoothie (quarter sized), and a small palmful of LA Looks blue gel. I let it sit in a cotton t-shirt fit ten minutes while I washed my face and applied lotion. Then I diffused it which took like thirty minutes... with two fucking parts of my head shaved ._. 

Then I fucked it up by constantly messing with it throughout the day :DDDDD I change the way my hair is flipped a lot which ruins the curl. 

Anyway I just don’t think I can manage doing this three days a week. It’s why I lapsed, and honestly squishing and diffusing does such wonders for my hair. Just wish it didn’t take so long! I did this for my best friend’s wedding... I also shaved my legs which is like, crazy devotion for me.

I’m also switching out some products. The low porosity line is really stripping so I might use that as a clarifying shampoo. Gonna use the Pantene Rose Water shampoo instead.

I don’t understand why OP didn’t stand his ground and actually go through with it when he told his parents they wouldn’t be attending dinner. Why would you even CHANCE it when you knew how bad it might hurt your girlfriend? She is absolutely in the right to not want them in her life.

And maybe I misread orOP didn’t word it correctly, but he says she’s angry about him insisting she forgive his brother? What the FUCK."
Teachers,ewpxpzy,t3_cpk9dm,1565651834.0,"Today was my first day teaching, lol. I have been on edge all day and forgot about 1. what recess we were scheduled for (took them to the wrong place) 2. And almost took them the wrong place for PE. 

I have that info on hand. I was just so nervous I didn’t look.

And the principal observed me bombing the science lesson because I didn’t have all the materials :/"
worldnews,ewo0x83,t1_ewnznv4,1565600255.0,"In this instance, the “white” in “white savior” is not only referring to the physical skin tone of the people who perpetuate this phenomenon. It implies the power and, yes, “privilege” of whiteness as a whole. 

Being white isn’t the only kind of societal privilege one can have. Class is one, gender is another, sexual orientation, religion, health, etc. So if we saw an affluent, non-white person go to another country and do what this girl did, there is still a colonialist aspect to it. There is still a power imbalance there. 

I’m assuming you’re asking in good faith."

worldnews,ewi46av,t1_ewi146x,1565437619.0,"Because it is an inherently racist, colonialist point of view to believe that your underqualified ass has the expertise and knowledge to go to a country you know little about to save 105+ Ugandan children when you have no medical license or even any real understanding of what they are going through. The ego she has to believe she was capable of this is 100% informed by her status as an upper class white woman.  

People with white savior complexes can be just as dangerous as a white supremacists — and sometimes even moreso, as we see here. It has a long history, too: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior?wprov=sfti1"
Teachers,ew5q7ol,t1_ew2ymun,1565142400.0,"I’m a brand new teacher in a similar situation, with absolutely no savings going into an empty classroom  knowing it’s pretty unlikely for kids to be coming in with supplies. The resources at my school are limited, and I don’t get my supply card till later in the year.

I did make a wishlist and it was really successful. I was able to equip my classroom and also procure some materials that can help out other teachers in my school."

Other student: “You got some long ass arms, boy.”

Also, during a writing assignment where they were supposed to choose an object they would be: “Fast food because first you love me then I kill you.” 

I had to tell him it was inappropriate but... it was a creative answer."
