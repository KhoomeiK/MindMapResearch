podcasting,fp2bll2,t1_fp27eim,1588258880.0,"Doing the research and talking to folks, one of the big takeaways relates to hard hard it is for governments to kick questionable habits if they're making money and solidifying their overall power. The British has 100+ years of people being opposed to the opium trade within Britain. And that's BEFORE the opium wars. Then another 50ish years before prohibition style thinking kicked in, which itself set the stage for the growth of organized crime.

We really have to make drugs (as far as users go) a health issue. People having tax money spent on them going to jail for minor possession makes no sense to me and there's no good data supporting efficacy of that approach. 

Supply side, farmers are usually the ones to get the most hurt. Measures really have to focus on the criminal orgs buying and processing the raw drugs and more support for farmers. 

In terms of international criminal orgs, they run so deep with governments (in many places its at least condoned and fueled by bribes, in some its even more blatant). The more I learn about drug markets, the arms trade, money laundering, the more I think that actually getting rid of all corruption would lead to a global economic slowdown bc illegal/questionable activities bring in crazy $$"

Also, do you keep the IP to the show or is it theirs and outsourcing it to you? 

I would also consider what's more important to you given your circumstances right now - do you want more money in the short term or the long term? If you're in a position where you need more cash in the short term, I'd go for getting the best salary you can and a more modest revenue share, if any at all depending on what see as the shows realistic prospects. Not sure what your role was before this, but if you were getting paid less than someone would for full production/management of a podcast, then you should definitely argue for 100% salary + raise. If you're getting paid more, then you may need to take a cut.

Other folks have given some good ideas of how to estimate the rate if you don't have others to ask. 

If you're in the position that the 50% salary covers you while your company is dealing with the financial impacts of coronapocalypse, you can get creative. One option is to say you'll stay on 50% for 3-6 months but then go up to 100+a bigger raise% after. Another option focusing on shared ad revenue or a bonus tied to ad revenue brought in. I have no clue what amount of ad revenue is likely/doable/if you knock it out of the park. 

Basically, if you know this show might make money for them and you're in a position where you don't need to ask them for more % right now, the more you can argue for (especially if you make it a %-based link). So if I were in your shoes and you think the company can pull in a lot of money from it, I would say keep me at 50% (assuming I can comfortably survive on that with savings, etc.), bring me to salary+raise in 3/6 months, and give me ad revenue share or a bonus tied to revenue dollars brought in. 

Here are some #s based some outreach I did for a podcast I was working on. To just have editing services can run from \~$100-$300 / ep depending on interview vs narrative. Getting a podcast fully made/produced can cost up to $3-4k an ep if you're producing something more NPR-esque with a buttload of interviews and doing all of the capture said interviews and writing. 

Hope this helps!"

It's ok if it doesn't sound great, test it out and figure out who would be involved and what's the focus of the podcast. Then figure out your goal - try to make money (tough) or to just make content and whatever happens, happens. 

Keep in mind that less than 8% of podcasts make money from advertising, I don't have #'s on Patreon supporters but it's not a lot either. Tipping is great, but if you plan on making money, you have put the time to build a community over a few years and then you can do events and create other content (books, merch, get a subscription). 

If you're doing it just to learn and try your hand at it, awesome! Don't worry about making it perfect in terms of quality. Figure out your focus, who you're working with, do a few trial episodes to figure out the time commitment, create a plan for recording and editing, and then you're off! As a personal podcaster just getting started, I think consistency is most important. 

You can improve the quality of the podcast as you go. If you are able to get equipment, definitely do it. Improving quality is important in terms of retaining listeners. But again, if your base to begin is friends and family, just keep it consistent. The other posts gave good ideas for equipment so I won't repeat. On to hosting platforms! 

I'm personally not a fan of Anchor, though I know that the whole they own your content idea isn't really true (they license it while you create through them). Buzzsprout, Pinecast, and Podbean all have free options too."

depression,fftlzgl,t3_euz21i,1580223955.0,"I'm 31 now and deal with very persistent depression. 5 years ago I spent a summer debating whether to kill myself, and luckily my relationship with my mom and my sis were strong enough to know that I wasn't going to do it. That made me really reconsider what's the point. The only honest answer I came up with was - there is no point. The beauty of life and being human is that we get to look at a ball of chaos full of assholes or idiots against a backdrop of emotionless, random nature, and we get to create a purpose for ourselves in spite of there not being any rhyme or reason to life. 

Sure, some people get lucky. I got lucky with my mom and sister giving me a psychological safety net (I got super lucky that mom is a dope therapist and actually knows her shit and practices it). Some people find what they want to do early on. Some are lucky and grow up surrounded by the people they need to help them grow. Some win the genetic lottery. Some have money or friends or distractions galore. Most get served a heaping pile of shit with little to make up for it.  

There's only one thing any of us has real control over - our outlook on life. Anything else is at least partially not ours. Focus on what you can control and slowly start painting a brighter picture. I'm not gonna pretend you'll 'fix' your depression, but it's possible to put in enough work that even on the shittiest of days, part of your brain will still find something to appreciate and see the beauty in. It's still a daily struggle, but appreciation of life is definitely attainable. 

Don't know where to start? Start making tiny changes. Do one thing today you haven't for ages. Maybe that's a shower today. Or brushing your teeth. Or go for a wk and listen to nature. Or just sit outside. Something, anything. But keeping adding to it. And you'll stumble, we all do. That doesn't mean its not possible, it's just an inevitable speed bump on the road of life.

I'm sorry you're in a bad place mentally speaking. I hope you can find the things that spur positive change for you. Feel free to pm if you want to chat"

podcasts,ffgqzsu,t3_etf9kg,1579912839.0,"Couple of thoughts here:

1. If you approach the school/department, decent chance they would not be open to something like the weed aspect of it (unless you live somewhere its legal and/or psych faculty already have approval for weed-related testing. And if they're conservative, they might try to pressure you to not so that there isn't a podcast out there that might reflect badly on them
2. The use of the word experiment can throw some people off as it might sound like you're trying to podcast about rigorous academic testing, which to someone else's point will take a super long time and be less exciting for podcasts. There's nothing wrong with being more of a series of informal experiments, just make sure to be clear about that
3. Be wary of using your names if you're underage and drinking or smoking or doing anything illegal - to the point of whoever commented that you might get kicked out, better to be safe than sorry 

Overall, I like the idea and would check it out. Just be careful to not accidentally get yourselves in trouble. Do you have anyone with more of a psych or behavioral econ background?
