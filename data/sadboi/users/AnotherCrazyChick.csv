At this point, I'm looking into if Lamictal is what is causing my PCOS to worsen. Insurance company reps are not doctors and they have no clue why the rules are the way they are. Doctors don't have time to explain all of the billing hoops they have to jump through and barely have time to give their patients adequate care.

Insurance companies aren't going to cover birth control prescribed by a psych doctor because their field is mental health. A gynecologist wouldn't prescribe birth control for mental health, they specialize in your reproductive system's health. If your psych doctor recommends birth control, then they should refer you to your gynecologist, who should assess if it's a good option for your reproductive health. Whoever bills your insurance from your gyno's office should be using the correct billing codes so that you can have open, honest, and clear communication with your doctor. If you don't have a psych doctor, then your gynecologist should refer you to one in order to treat your mental health in conjunction with your reproductive health. Thus they should prescribe the birth control and it should be covered as long as you receive a referral for a mental health practitioner."

I can be very naive and not realize how I come across to other people. Most of the time, I just don’t care. But it’s important to be aware of how others perceive you. Is she saying you may inadvertently friend zone him? Or that you may appear sexist towards women? Could be so many things. Definitely ask for clarification and just remember deep down, she loves you and wants you to be happy. She’s just concerned and wants to help, not make you feel shitty for not conforming. And if the concern does in fact come down to shaming you for being you, remember that traditional norms formed with the purpose of keeping your tribe of loved ones safe. People fear things that go against traditional norms because it makes them feel vulnerable and thus like your safety could potentially be threatened. I’m AFAB with very masculine leanings. There is nothing shameful about gender, the lack thereof, or not conforming to gender norms.

However looking from the inside, they’re getting a little too big too fast. A lot of the people came from big banks and are treating it like one. And since they’ve grown so much the past couple of years, you’ll likely have little issues here or there with growing pains.

I also have accounts with Rivermark and absolutely love them. Their rates on savings accounts are good and they’re the only ones I’m aware of with remote Tellers. You can go into a branch after they close and video chat with a teller in the call center until like 8pm. I don’t think they have branches downtown though.

One good thing about credit unions is that most are part of the CO-OP [shared branches network](http://www.sharedbranching.org) so you can go into any sister CU branch to do a lot of your banking.

Last suggestion is Onpoint. I see branches everywhere and have heard they’re good, I just don’t have any experience with them to give you examples."

They called and left a message one time in January or around the beginning of the year to discuss a payment plan and because I had no money coming in, I never followed up until when I paid it...two weeks ago.

There were a few times that I felt disturbed all day after the horrible dreams I woke up just sobbing in emotional pain. On top of the normal insomnia that comes with mania, I have always been a light sleeper and hardly ever sleep deep enough to hit REM and have dreams.
