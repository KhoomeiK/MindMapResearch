PandR,fhyh0ly,t1_fhydegn,1581975725.0,I went onto the website “Print & Play.” They sell board game prototype pieces in bulk for pretty good prices. I think I’ll end up using the site again if I ever need replacement pieces for any of my other board games.
PandR,fhy0fph,t3_f59z0o,1581965981.0,"I tried to buy the game first, but the Kickstarter campaign for it ended unsuccessfully. There’s nowhere you can buy it as a whole game. I ended up making this game as a present, but I used a few resources as reference. Here’s a link to one of my favorites... http://www.cephalofair.com/2014/06/build-dunshire.html"

On another note, if you haven’t already, you might want to check in with your doctor about a potential hormone imbalance. I was diagnosed with a hormonal imbalance a few years ago and it was the cause of most of my big panic attacks. Now that I’m on the right medication it’s much better! If your doctor does a blood test they can let you know for sure.

Fingers crossed you feel better soon!"

Anxiety,evzl73p,t1_evzku5m,1564960491.0,"I’ve had a pretty anxious personality my whole life, but my first panic attack was related to an underlying medical condition I hadn’t been diagnosed with yet in middle school. The medical issues have been (relatively) taken care of at this point, but the general anxiety is still a part of my life."

AskReddit,et97v04,t3_cak63q,1562589127.0,"When I first started dating my boyfriend I would show him memes and gifs that I thought were really funny. Almost every time I would show him something he would reply, “Oh I already saw that on Reddit yesterday/last week/awhile ago.” I got so frustrated that I decided to finally check out what this was all about, and I ended up finding other subreddits that interested me."
