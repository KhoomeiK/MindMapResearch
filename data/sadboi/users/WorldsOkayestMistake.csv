cyclothymia,fed59z5,t1_fec7u8x,1578999552.0,"I appreciate hearing this from you, it's comforting to know that someone else gets it. I can feel myself transitioning from what might be considered ""mania"" to depression and it's scaring me. I'm sick of not being able to keep anyone around. I'm much younger than you but I've never been able to keep a relationship(as in friendship, work relationship or familial relationship) longer than a year before it all went downhill and spiraled into conflict. I wish you luck, both of us could use it, it seems."
BPD,fe8pb2j,t3_eo3iom,1578928822.0,"I would most definitely agree but would like to add on to this. Those who do preach this message might do it out of ignorance. An innocent message that they don't know the depths of. Maybe they do know how bad it can get, but its not a tangible thing in their mind. This is something I've noticed quite a bit as I've cycled through plenty of friends just like this. It's brought on a lot of shame in recent months. I avoid having people over because it takes days to clean up after neglecting chores around the house. I avoid physical closeness as a habit because it would be difficult for me to find the motivation for personal hygiene at one point. I avoid telling my doctor about the embarrassing side effects of lack of self-care for my mind and body out of shame. I forget that others struggle in similar ways, so I can imagine that this could be a large factor in the virtue signaling you're talking about. There are two sides to the street here, and while it is not their job to support others, I feel that it is our(those who struggle with mental illness) responsibility to be honest and forthcoming and supportive as we can possibly be. There is only so much we can do, but swallowing our pride and putting ourselves out there is essential in fighting against the stigma and stereotypes."

It was because I felt too strongly about something and cried due to being overwhelmed, but it was the self-harm that helped stop the crying. It calmed me down. My goal was to feel numb, no feelings, no tears, no stress, no anxiety; it helped me push myself even deeper into dissociative episodes."

AskReddit,f6mgwf4,t3_drxin2,1572972800.0,"I fake the caring, helpful, kind, side of myself. I used to be so invested in those I care about, so empathetic, I'd lose a limb just to help someone I love. But then I just stopped caring. I ignore those going through a hard time because I don't care and because it's too much to handle. Interactions where people end up crying are just awkward and uncomfortable now, I can't hug anyone and I sure as hell can't be there. The only way I help someone now is pretending to care and saying I understand, no matter how much I don't."

I can't see any of the three being all that into science or math. No hard sciences at least, maybe one of you studied a soft science like psychology or even social sciences. I can definitely see the one on the right being big into philosophy or sociology, maybe even law, whereas the one in the center might be more into literature or fine arts. Now leftie is a bit harder here, seems like the artsy type, photography or visual/performing arts, maybe even something such as history or social science. Now that I think about it the one in the middle could have even majored in engineering, but that's a long shot for me.

Some quicker than others, some fade to be lighter than your skin, some stay darker, some are white, some pink, some purple, some brown. Some of them bruise and some don't. It all depends. Important thing is to keep them moisturized, massaging apparently helps the tissues heal, but never do this on any skin that's still closing or scabbing. I hope you can find a way to help youself, stay safe."
SelfHarmScars,f4y1bfo,t3_dkovu2,1571871267.0,"So I don't really know how to say this, but please be careful when you say things like that, someone who doesn't cut as deep might see this and be really affected by how you see your self harm and feel that theirs isn't valid either. Self harm is self harm, plain and simple. Purposefully hurting yourself is bad and it's awful that people are driven to the point of hurting themselves to cope with whatever the fuck is going on in their life. You and your struggles are valid, as are everyone else's, never forget that."

AskReddit,et85kx0,t3_c9ae4r,1562547151.0,"I'm not emotional. I used to be over the top and dramatic, bursting with emotion, positive and negative. I had no problem crying, showing or receiving affection or establishing close relationships. Now  it's like I'm a completely different person. I can still laugh, can still smile, I can still feel happy from time to time, but it's like I'm all out of negative feelings and the ability to express or empathize with them. It's not like I'm depressed and laying in bed all day, staring at a wall because I cannot feel and because my life is shitty and there's no point anymore, but I just kind of go onto autopilot. And like I previously stated, I cannot empathize. Someone could have a sick relative, be depressed, be going through a nasty breakup, but I could more easily pull a rabbit out of a hat than truly and honestly empathize with the person. It's like when I try to show empathy, I do it so I don't come across as an asshole, so people don't think there's something wrong with me. But on the other hand I don't care. I don't care one bit about what they're saying or what they're feeling. Now that I think about it, maybe I am an asshole. Anyway, it's not really a fear or a concern, but something I know I should be scared of."
