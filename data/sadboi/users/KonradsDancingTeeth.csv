A) effectively got rid of and made it impossible to vote by mail

B) he or his team understands that Democrats are largely not gullible retards who will go outside and not isolate

C) If he tells his voters and his people that this virus is nothing to worry about he can get more conservatives to vote outside (whether they die or not) than democrats effectively cheating the system once again.

And judging by his successful smear campaign against Biden (true or not) he‚Äôs getting in for another term.

Basically by accident or design his party is counting on common sense to prevail only within the democrats who will be in isolation. Imo I would probs stay in isolation because your whole countries beyond fucked already."

todayilearned,fm30e4w,t1_fm2mbqc,1585709724.0,"My favourite running pseudo theory is that for a large portion of late antiquity as well as the medieval era, everyone was constantly drunk all the time because nobody drank water because it was typically unclean to drink - so most children mostly drank milk but adults were for the most part always drunk on beer wine or whatever sort of alcohol they could muster - so it wasn‚Äôt until later on in the renaissance that they started to lower alcohol concentration that people started wising up and doing productive things other than killing each other. Now that being said lota holes in my theory because to some extent not all water was polluted with cholera and various diseases or whatever, but most water was unsafe to drink.
What Im saying is that human development and improvement is perhaps indirectly linked to us not being drunk when making important historical decisions, like invading France or cutting down peasants for fun.

Edit: another proof that supports my hypothesis is their was less alcohol later in the renaissance and super late medieval era due to the plague and lack of crop production, which directly impacted alcohol production which made it so common folks could not really get ahold of the stuff.
