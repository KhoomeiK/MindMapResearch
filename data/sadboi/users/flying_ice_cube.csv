Depression was a bitch, and sadly Kurt couldn't work it out. I'm sure that he's better now, and I'm sure rock bands would never be the same without him.
Looking at this, I remember that Kurt had a daughter too, and for her, his death was way more painful than it is for the fans.
Rest in peace, Kurt"

Usually the community is very kind and all, and the basis of christianity is very recomforting and everything revolves around love, and how god loved you.

One question: on school, do you have a friend of best friend that you trust? If yes, do he/she know about your anxiety?
If not, tell he/she. An example from me: I'm a girl and almost everyone in my classroom is an asshole. But I do have my best friend that is supportive at every kind of problem involving my attacks.
When I feel like crying at school, I go to he and he comforts and distract me, and eventually I feel better. Sometimes when he isn't around, I go cry in the bathroom.
If you are gonna cry in the bathroom, don't make it loud.
Hope it'll help you, and keep at least me posted, please.

The basis of anxiety is overthinking, and you are overthinking that situation. It may be hard, I know, but focus on your training and all that stuff.
One question: do people on your team compliment you about your habilities? If yes, you don't have to worry.
When on the ""test"" (I don't know how it's called), try to explain to the couch your anxiety. If he/she's a kind person, he/she'll understand.

About after, try to find something quite infinite to be distracted with. Like looking at memes, or learn something. But don't let that ""hobbie"" make you lazy or desanimated"
Anxiety,ff6ubdb,t3_erzl2c,1579635037.0,"Well, maybe you are overthinking. If not (sorry the words), he looks a little asshole. 
People with anxiety don't choose to be with anxiety, and it's not our fault that we suffer like that. If he didn't understood that yet, try to explain to him.
But, looking for his point of view, it can be stressful to be in a relantionship with someone anxious. It just depends on the kindness of ypur partner to understand and help you.
In my case, I have someone that understand me and try to help me when I'm bad.
