From my experience of the facility I worked in, it was more of a holding ground with some high function and some low functioning patients. Violence was fairly common and you could guarantee that you be needed for assistance on other wards daily. You may have experienced yourself that there are some staff that are very professional and likeable, and some that are just there because they like to fight, which is probably true in most units unfortunately. I found that giving respect often gets respect back and in my five years in a secure unit, I was never assaulted directly.
