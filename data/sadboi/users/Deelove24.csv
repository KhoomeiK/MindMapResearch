mentalhealth,fonywho,t1_fonyabc,1587929202.0,My family isn't close. They're not supportive at all.  So I don't talk to them much. As for friends from high school i don't have any. I was picked on badly. I only have one friend now and I'm 25. I never keep friends long.

FortNiteBR,fon736w,t1_fon6zzk,1587913661.0,I believe it's something bigger. Not the old island coming back tho
FortNiteBR,fon50mg,t1_fon4rv5,1587912372.0,There has to be more island than just the 2. The event showed us that. I feel like they might play apart of the story in the future. Maybe they are in different dimensions or universes which is where the butterfly comes in.
FortNiteBR,fon4fve,t1_fon4abo,1587911999.0,Like I'm not saying were getting a new island but what if the fortnite world is bigger than we think it is.
FortNiteBR,fon45yr,t1_fon44mz,1587911817.0,It still raises some questions tho. Like are there more islands then the old one and the new one. Like we seen at the event. Even the astro jack skin has both island on his head.
FortNiteBR,fon3eel,t1_fomzs3c,1587911310.0,It has to mean something tho cause of the butterfly came back. I know the old map isn't coming back. (Something I've been known.) But the butterfly's return has to mean something
FortNiteBR,fon26d4,t3_g7rbti,1587910476.0,Why would they show the old map is the question. And the butterfly made a comeback
