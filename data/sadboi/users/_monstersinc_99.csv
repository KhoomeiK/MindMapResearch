Be careful tho with your civil disobedience I'm 100% for it but unfortunately we live in a society that ostrises you once you have any criminal record so do be careful! Best of luck <3"

AskReddit,f7fll8f,t1_f7eoblw,1573682033.0,"yeah I know right I'm so awkward honestly he asked if I had a boyfriend and I just lied, I've got a made up boyfriend now with believable backstory, some people can be really persistent I've been asked out at work before a few times rip (waitress/hospo worker) and sometimes you have to go further and lie because the guy will not care if you have a boyfriend and still demand to see you after you finish work or will keep coming into the store ( I had a guy come into my fucking work and ask me why I didn't accept his facebook request) so I just lie and say my fake boyfriend is crazy controlling :(( I'm really afraid of men tbh but I try to put my bias aside and give everyone a chance (sorry if there are heaps of spelling mistakes I have dyslexia)"
AskReddit,f7fl6we,t1_f7ez45g,1573681786.0,I live in a place where there is a high density of  tourists so when people approach me I'm like oh I'll help you out I know how shit it is to be lost but he was actually from where I live fuck thank's for all the response guys I have much much worse horrifying men stalk stories if anyone wants to hear
Anarchism,f7fko2p,t3_dvvb8a,1573681460.0,"Honestly this kinda delusion is insane, I had a guy once grab me and hold me in a lock (he was drunk but no excuse I was completely sober) and I couldn't get out of his hold and he said ""he was comforting me"" I manged to get out after about 10 minutes because he fell asleep but I had to sit there for ten minutes and not fucking move. Now a group of men actually despise me (his mates) and I'm like if only you knew he later apologized to me via Instagram but then took back his apology he was also a conservative he had Jordan Peterson's book in his room and loved Milo and Ben Sharpiro and acquainted rape with stealing and  having locks on your doors."
AskReddit,f7dwpn4,t3_dvo2yk,1573633841.0,"please don't approach lmao I've been approachd on the street by strangers a few times once I thought this guy was foreign and I was trying to be nice I thought he just wanted directions and he was all like ""just wanted to say I thought you were really pretty"" Then shakes my hand. Good mems my co worker today said I looked like a pre pubcent boy tho so I dunno what's going on lol"

Like my paranoia is basically gone now, when I was really down and paranoid I'd constantly be asking my friends if they liked me and to a certain extent it's still there at the back of my mind but it's not complely controling my life and interations! Wishing you the best stay strong !"

bipolar,f7dw89d,t1_f7bbqdk,1573633109.0,it was just a meme about monsters inc being the 21st centuries example of the proletariat's class war with the bourgeoise I am a bit of a fuckhead if I'm being honest I can be a bit implusive sometimes I just wish my brain would mute you know. I know right so happy it's only temp
bipolar,f7b099a,t3_dv2q0x,1573548563.0,gosh I'm so implusive and paranoid I recommend keeping a mood diary via excel (so then no one can sell your data) and its accesiable via phone and computer tablet I can send you the template of mine if needed <3
bipolar,f7b04ms,t3_dv4dzt,1573548373.0,I was anti drugs for ages due to my mothers opoid drug addiction and all throughout highschool I had bipolar 1 and recently I suffered from psychosis which was very tough I was briefly hospitlised but I am on good medication now and I haven't had any severe psycosis for at least 3 months. I'm on 5 different medications but I think learning to trust your practioner and ask about the drugs and do your own research on top of that it really helps also talking to a professional is amazing in being able to recognise your symptoms and how to recover and live a relitevely stable life btw sorry for all the spelling mistake I have dyslexia!
