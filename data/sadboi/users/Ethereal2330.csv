Anxiety,ewah8nf,t3_cn74pu,1565243647.0,"I can agree with this statement. I feel like I am running out of time as well and I'm not even 30 yet. 
I wonder if it's the anxiety that makes us feel this way or society making people feel like they need to do certain things by a certain time frame?"

Anxiety,euwqfma,t3_chl6gx,1564078319.0,"      So, I posted my first thing here on reddit and i found out its frustrating when the take your posts down for wording it incorrectly OR the most hurtful one is when you get a troll on your hands. I posted my art and I had this one guy tear it apart and tell me to never draw again and that I'm a disgrace. I never knew how mean people could be for no reason...that's why I am afraid to post...I dont wanna be trolled lol"
