wwiipics,fc1z1gw,t1_fc1kvo8,1577334231.0,"There’s no doubt Germany is responsible, but you also have to ask yourself how your nation would’ve acted if you were exposed to the same economic difficulties and level of nazi propaganda that the Germans were exposed to, with minimal other sources of information to counter that propaganda. The nazi party effectively just brainwashed a nation. Doesn’t make it right in any way, but also a large portion of Germans were just brainwashed into nazism, because they were taught it everywhere from school to sport."

AskReddit,et2zh5k,t1_et2xosn,1562425538.0,"Ok, now you're just nit picking my argument. I used extreme examples such as war and cults because generally they are easier to understand because they are obvious examples, but the concept can be applied to other aspects of life. 

As I said you and I disagree on what causes human behaviour, whether it be environmental factors or just intrinsic individual traits. 

I never said I wanted to live in a world that doesn't hold people accountable for their actions. And no that doesn't promote crime, the discussion is actually more relevant to how people are treated after going through the justice system. 

I think you aren't really understanding what the original discussion was about, are twisting my words, are taking this whole thing out of context and aren't really understanding what I've been trying to say."
AskReddit,et2wska,t1_et2pu4b,1562424081.0,"I think I replied to you in an above comment, and covered most of what is said here. But I just want to say that I am trying to be PC as to avoid confusion on what I am saying. I'm not being PC to help paint someone as the victim, i'm being PC as to make a relevant argument that makes sense in expressing how I feel about the situation, in a way that can't be twisted or confused (as little as possible at least). I disagree that it is natural instinct telling you not to kill, I believe its cultural/environmental. I also want to point out that you cant say ""go ask any kid on the street, they'll tell you murder is not ok"" because majority of those kids have been raised in a society and environment that teaches them that killing is not ok, so of course they are going to say killing is not ok. Also you pointed out an example of someone shooting up a mosque. Often people who commit crimes like this are mentally unstable or could be labelled as ""terrorists"", and terrorism has causal factors and conditioning (or ""grooming"" if you want to call it that) that leads these people (terrorists) to believe they are doing the right thing by killing people. I'm not trying to be rude here but honestly I'm a bit lost by your argument and I don't think the points fully back what you are saying very well. 

But regardless of all the words above, I think you and I just simply disagree about the causes of human behaviour and have different perspectives on people who have committed crimes, which is fine but probably means that this discussion won't really go anywhere from here and it's becoming a bit circular. Thanks for offering your opinion though, I do appreciate hearing a new perspective."
AskReddit,et2tvpd,t1_et2s2nc,1562422622.0,I agree it's just disagreement on what you believe between if you believe a persons behaviours are more so based upon individual traits versus environmental factors.
AskReddit,et2su3y,t1_et2nn8d,1562422085.0,"Upbringing, environment and economic status can all be influencing factors on whether individuals will be deviant within society, and murder is a form of deviation. If he was raised in a cult and everyday they told him ""hey its okay for you to kill people"" then he would probably think murder is ok. If he was born into a war zone or a place where killing is prevalent and witnessed it frequently then he may become desensitized to the idea that killing is wrong, making him more likely to commit murder. If was raised in a low socioeconomic area or lived in poverty then perhaps this could lead to other issues such as drug abuse which can in some instances evolve into a murder, which is what happened in OP's case according to him. So yes, environmental factors do influence individuals behaviour, and in some cases may make them believe murder is ok. Why do soldiers think it's ok to kill the enemy? Its because of the environmental factors and conditioning they experienced in society and training. 

And I disagree that not killing is a natural human instinct, I believe it is engrained in us through culture. But that is personal opinion so not really relevant to this discussion. 

I'm not saying that in the case of the murder he was a victim. He was found guilty, he murdered someone, he is guilty and that is not excusable. I'm saying that everyone is being incredibly harsh on an individual they don't know, with a past they don't know, and effectively saying he can't come back from that. He basically said that he didn't know how to function appropriately within society, leading to him killing someone, but now he understands and recognises that was wrong and not ok. 

Again, not saying he is a victim, he did commit murder and was found guilty. If anything I would be saying he is possibly a victim of the circumstances that lead him to commit murder, yet people fail to recognise that their are circumstances that lead up to the event, and are being incredibly harsh on someone who has served time and has changed as a person to understand that their actions were unacceptable (according to the comment he made). 

I guess it just comes down to personal belief on whether you think human behaviour is based majority on individual human traits or external environmental factors."
AskReddit,et24otz,t1_et22q9g,1562410953.0,Not really. I'd say it's more causation rather than justification
AskReddit,et1rclf,t1_et1qck8,1562402387.0,"Also to clarify, the term ""polite society"" probably isn't fully correct and can be quite misleading as it leads individuals to think of manners instead of moral code."
AskReddit,et1r22k,t1_et1m0fs,1562402226.0,"I think a lot of people are misinterpreting what he's saying. ""Polite society"" probably isn't the correct term to be used, but I think he's basically saying he had a distorted vision of what was considered acceptable and unacceptable behaviour within our society. This could be due to many factors such as upbringing, environment, economic status etc. But now after jail time he is saying he knows murder is wrong, but when he was younger he didn't know how to behave within society."
AskReddit,et1qck8,t1_et1g6kq,1562401802.0,"Noone is excusing murder here. It's a terrible thing and is unacceptable. What people are trying to say is perhaps you should be less judgemental on those who have made mistakes because we don't know all the factors that lead them to do the things they did, especially when they recognise that what they did was wrong and are attempting to move forward from it. He also didn't state that he found it rude to ask, he said that some people with charges might be offended if you do ask them. That doesn't make it socially unacceptable or rude to ask them (I agree if you murdered someone you have to live, accept and deal with all the consequences and ownership of those consequences which includes people asking), it just means that they might get defensive because they're embarrassed about it (often as a lot of us are when people bring up our mistakes). He also didn't say that when he was younger he wasn't polite and that murder comes under the bracket of ""not being polite"". He said that he didn't know how to behave in a ""polite society"", ie a society where they don't murder and rob and so on, a society that is based around a moral code of some sorts, like the society we live. He's basically saying he didn't know how to behave within our society and function within it's moral codes. Not that murder is just simply being ""impolite""."
AskReddit,et1fdt8,t1_et1c1p8,1562396483.0,"I'm not justifying murder, but you don't know this person or the situation they were in. Perhaps they had a mental illness, or perhaps They were raised around people that killed often so they learnt that that behaviour was acceptable. Again, I'm not justifying murder, but they clearly aren't proud of what they did and know it's wrong and might've been in a situation/situations that you or I can't comprehend or understand because we haven't lived them."
