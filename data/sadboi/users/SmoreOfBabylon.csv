Anxiety,fquhbos,t1_fqufb2a,1589658974.0,"If you’re referring to the comment about how long it takes to develop a vaccine, it may be helpful to know that at least one of the most promising vaccine candidates we have at this point (Oxford’s ChAdOx) has *already* gone through a few years’ worth of development and trials, including human safety trials and a very promising recent trial in rhesus macaques. This is because it started as a vaccine for MERS, it didn’t suddenly appear this year out of nowhere. 

Timelines for possible treatments can also be shortened dramatically when considering “pipeline” drugs, i.e. drugs that have already gone through rigorous trials and approvals for treating some other condition. This is why drugs like remdesivir, HCQ, Avigan, and several others are even able to be administered to COVID patients right now, because they have already been proven safe to take for something else. The only thing left really is to test their efficacy against COVID specifically, which is what a lot of current Stage III clinical trials are aiming to do.

That’s one thing many doomers have been missing: in many cases, we’re not exactly starting from scratch with vaccines or treatments."

There seems to be less mask use among people just out jogging/biking/walking their dogs, but transmission risk is lower outdoors anyway and most of these people give each other a wide berth when they pass. If I happen to encounter anyone out in public without a mask, I steer well clear of them.

Also, the only poll I could find online that gauged face mask use for North Carolina (and other states) was a YouGov poll that started polling people back in late March, at which time a lot of people were probably still following the old WHO guidance to *not* wear masks when asymptomatic in order to save them for healthcare workers and first responders.

tornado,fqjylvn,t1_fqjc2it,1589417121.0,"Yeah, one big problem as I see it with allowing ground radar observations to figure into tornado ratings is that, even if you manage to work out how to correctly and consistently  sample tornadoes for wind speed at ground level, there will be an inherent sampling bias towards tornadoes in the Great Plains or wherever the portable radars are most often deployed by the institutions that currently maintain them. Ironically, this would almost be a modern parallel to an issue that Tom Grazulis brings up in *Significant Tornadoes* - we know *now* that the Deep South is and probably always has been prone to regular violent tornadoes, but it’s quite hard to get a handle on just how many actually occurred there prior to 1950, because the widespread proliferation of sharecropper cabins and other poorly-constructed buildings in the Deep South in that era meant that fewer tornadoes were hitting structures that would show their true strength compared to the Midwest or Great Plains during the same time period. So there is a relative dearth of violent tornadoes in the record for the Deep South even though more of them most certainly happened than we know (see: the major Southern outbreaks of 1875, 1884, 1924, 1932, 1936, etc.)

IMO, it may be that the only method by which we might “catch” some of these underrated strong/violent tornadoes with a standardized system of field observations might be with something like tree/vegetation damage patterns. Fujita himself rated at least one tornado as violent based *solely* on tree damage (the Teton Wilderness tornado of 1987), and IIRC also bumped the rating of the 1990 Plainfield, IL tornado from F4 to F5 based on vegetation damage patterns, so there *is* a bit of basis for this kind of thing. However, there are so many variables from different tree species to soil conditions that creating a more robust and *consistent* rating system just for tree/vegetation damage may be impossible."

Fortunately, it looks like things are going okay there so far - their R0 has remained below 1, and although they’ve had some big case jumps, their hospitalizations and ventilator usage keep going down, so those “spikes” might either be a result of more testing or just that more and more cases are turning out to be mild.

I checked a bunch of other states in the region and they haven’t predicted anything like this for anyone else, not even states that have been more generous with reopening so far like Georgia. At this point I really have no idea what the hell they’re looking at that’s specific to us. The only thing I can think of is that our daily death rate is stubbornly refusing to go down, and lately this seems to be in large part because of nursing home outbreaks - the percentage of our deaths being from nursing homes was about 40% a few weeks ago, and now it’s about 60%. Several more nursing homes announced new outbreaks *and* deaths today. I’ve been wondering what effect this might have on the models, since infection rates in those places are going to be higher than among the general public, but deaths in them still get fed into the models for everyone.

FWIW, I’ve also been following the Los Alamos model (which I like because they actually show you which of their projections have been closest to reality in your state so far), and although they don’t think we’re quite at peak yet, it’s likely that it will be sometime in the next couple of weeks and the curve starts to go down afterwards."

I could see a scenario where a show would be performed behind closed doors, and the performance streamed to multiple movie theaters (which could limit capacity and may even run multiple screenings a day to spread out the crowds). Who knows, maybe they could even do a PPV home streaming option online or something. I know that a lot of these shows market themselves on the “exclusivity” of actually seeing a musical in person, but I feel like it’s going to be a while before they can play to packed houses again and in the meantime their performers and staff aren’t getting paid.

So the mechanisms by which they infect the body are somewhat different.

Combine that with an aged population that probably never thought to get the MMR vaccine after it was introduced since those are “childhood” diseases, and...yeah, this is an interesting train of thought.

As an aside, the Madagascar flag mask in that article is pretty dope.

Edit: I wonder if the vaccine that was administered in Madagascar was the actual MMR vaccine or the more recent MMRV shot (measles/mumps/rubella/varicella aka chicken pox)? I’ve had the former but the latter didn’t even exist when I was a little kid."

Not even just Twitter, remember that stupid “fire and fury” speech on the floor of the UN? I went through a period of *extreme* anxiety because journalists I actually respected were saying things like “you’re scaring me, Mr. Trump”. Twitter was chock full of fear-mongering and armchair foreign policy experts. And if I had a dollar for every time some subreddit took something as a sign that WW3 was *just about to* happen...

Point being, nothing really came of that and it was about 98% bluster, 2% NK firing off a bunch of test missiles like they always do. Trump’s not so much a warmonger as he likes acting tough because it makes him feel important and his base likes it. With as much money as China makes off of the US, I can almost guarantee that they’re not interested in an actual war, especially since we just got through that big “trade war” that wasn’t particularly good for either country. And certainly both countries have a lot more to worry about right now anyway."

They’re both in the SF Bay Area which has been one of the strictest and most proactive regions in the US for virus mitigation strategies. 

And commuting to either of them unless you already live close by is indeed a pain in the ass.

He created the Cherokee syllabary, a system of characters with which anyone fluent in the Cherokee language could quickly and easily learn to read and write. His syllabary was quickly adopted by the Cherokee nation, and within a few years was so prolific that literacy among the Cherokee exceeded that of whites in some areas.
