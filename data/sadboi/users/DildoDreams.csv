We weren’t absolutely sure that that was what we had in the first place but our antibody tests came back a couple days ago and sure enough they were positive

So, basically it wildly varies from person to person. I’m 16, my brother’s 13. I smoke cigarettes among other things and am by far not the healthiest person, and he’s an up and coming athlete who treats his body like a temple yet he’s the one who got it bad. It’s insanely unpredictable, really."

Edit: Most of his videos have the general theme of “Hi, I’m (bullshit name) and I’m (complete lie) years old. I’m looking for (insert attractive young woman here)”. A singer from Houston, Alyssa May, pops up pretty frequently on the channel. Strange stuff. Gonna try and get something out of this

Edit 2: [This video](https://youtu.be/zMkJiKbtTZg) shows up alot in the guy’s content. It’s got Alyssa May in it, of course. So far it looks to be that this man is a socially stunted creep with a macbook and a serious obsession for this obscure singing woman. There may or may not be something darker going on.

I assumed that whoever this man is, seeing as he’s so obsessed, he would be following Alyssa on Instagram. I was right. I went to her insta, which had been mentioned many times by “Jackie”, and in her followers searched up keywords that are commonly used by him. I ended up finding Stacy May, or stacymay8000. An account which has 9 followers, and doesn’t seem to be necessarily related at first. (**REVISION: Nevermind that. In the IGTV section of Stacy May’s account, there is a disturbing video exactly like the ones off of the youtube channel**) But you go to “Stacy May’s” followers, and you’ll find an account called Alyssa May Nicholas, where Mii’s are posted, Alyssa May is mentioned, and the name Vicki Nicholas is prevalent, just like in the original youtube channel. This account is also following the pattern of stating a fake name and age and saying that they’re searching for somebody. There’s another account here you get led to, amanda20702 or Amanda May. Obviously the work of this same man. Lots of ASMR stuff, game show shit like Deal or No Deal and Wheel of Fortune, and, a new one, anime. Tons of creepy ass content too. This account happens to be following the hashtag “sanleonelementary”, meaning an elementary school in San Leon, TX. Not sure what this means exactly aside from that this man is likely from San Leon. What an interesting goddamn rabbithole, OP

This all goes very deep, there are a ton of related instagram and youtube accounts that are shown here. I’m probably done looking into all this for the night but I hope I at least helped somebody lmao"
