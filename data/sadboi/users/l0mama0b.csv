Depop,fqw62n2,t3_gl3qob,1589693899.0,"I think my worst experience in Depop was finding this super cute shirt that I felt like I’d been searching all my life for, purchasing it, and the receiving the WRONG SHIRT a month later. I messaged her and all she could say was “sorry, I’m moving it’s hard for me to keep track of what is what!”.. and I was (politely) like “dude I don’t care if you just send me the right shirt I’ll return this and not even ask for a refund” and she’s like “sorry! Can’t find it!” </3"
