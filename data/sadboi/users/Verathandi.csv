It's so hard to manage your own feelings and trauma but you have and do, and to top it all off you've chosen to become someone that can help others to heal.
I hope that I can become as confident as you are and I just really want to emphasize how wonderfully you have done with your own wellbeing and career.
As others have said above, having your own struggles and pain enables us to help others find their way back to themselves. Inspiration!"

BipolarReddit,fihsxud,t3_f7wswo,1582413822.0,"Internet hugs from a stranger. It sounds like you have been through quite a lot, so self compassion is key. We are often our own worst enemy, and it can be easy to gloss over or forget all the hard work that's going into just 'functioning' as normal to the outside world, so it's important to celebrate your successes as much as you can. 

I find that taking every day as it comes and focusing on what can be reasonably accomplished (and not beating yourself up over those tasks) is helpful. I use journalling as an outlet as well as to plan out my days and weeks, but YMMV. If you can get some therapy to work through your feelings around BP and work/life in general, that's a good way to get practical skills to manage your moods and lessen their impact on your work performance, hopefully. I appreciate that you might not have access to a therapist though...

Remember that you have had serious struggles to overcome, and while you may be 'running behind' on your ideal life goals, you are still alive and present and you have the strength in you to get to where you want to be. 


I hope that's helpful in some way. You are certainly not alone. Thanks for sharing."

I will be more lively when I can be, but most of the time I'm not feeling that way and likely it's an act I'm doing to be polite. I often have to suppress my good moods so I don't seem unhinged when I am feeling cheerful and peppy. I have to make sure my behaviour tracks with the rest of my personality when I am quiet most of the rest of the time. If that makes sense.

britishproblems,f6k8x41,t1_f6jfgqp,1572907682.0,"I have to agree with this, I am a non-clinical NHS worker and have a good idea of how low the quality of service can be in my city. The NHS is fantastic when it works but horrendous when it doesn't, and seems to not be working too well lately. I'm sure I'm repeating some of the points others have made already, but it is suffering and stretched to the limit. The amount of money, time and staff wasted on bureaucracy, incompetent and toxic middle management, blame and bullying culture and inefficient and outdated IT/infrastructure systems is shocking. The mental health services are doing their best which is not good enough as many fall through the cracks. There is definitely a postcode lottery when it comes to standards of care provided to patients in X or Y area.
Working in this mire are the non-clinical and clinical staff members most of which are just trying to help and get by as much as possible, but it's enough to turn anybody bitter and cynical.  The NHS needs something (definitely don't support it being privatised!), but at this point I'm hard-pressed to say what... idk."

He has brought it up to management before and they've done nothing about it. This bully has made racial slurs towards other workers, bullied others into leaving and just generally being awful.

I fully appreciate that he's wrong to have snapped, and luckily they don't have customers at their base to witness it. But obviously we're both really worried about this and what it could lead to.

They've asked him to write up his recollection of events and bring it with him tomorrow. Just to be prepared, we've completed a formal grievance letter as well, ready  to go in case he needs it  Hopefully this will just be management trying to sort things out amicably.
