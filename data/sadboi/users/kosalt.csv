Always maximizing profit while cutting corners like not paying Chinese teachers on time, sometimes even a month late, then shaming said Chinese staff for not having saved enough of their meager salary to float a month. They registered my visa as working for another company in another city. I was i Kunming at the time. My visa was registered in Chengdu. This led to them not being able to cancel my work permit when I left upon contract completion (they’d renewed it) and I had to wait an entire year for it to expire. At one point, out plumbing flooded, and they just fucking let us sit in a rotting moldy toilet stinking office for more than 3 months while repairs were delayed. They conducted class in a shitty ass office turned classroom for that entire time. Children right next to toilet water molded floors and walls and furniture. I could say so much more. Don’t work for them. If you want to work with young children in Shenzhen, let me know. I’ll put you in contact with my boss."

bipolar,f05xwuh,t1_f05x282,1568423004.0,"Yeah, you're right. I live in China... so having a psychiatrist/being under a doctor's care isn't really an option. The mental health stuff just hasn't clicked in the culture. If you are a functioning person with a job and a life, there's no way you're ill... and if you are, you might get someone prescribing you any number of traditional medicines and/or western medicines. Language  barriers definitely don't make it easier, nor the fact that I'm on a work visa, which I must pass an annual medical check to keep... during that check I deny mental health problems and don't disclose my history. I am fully aware that it might get worse. When I go back to the US, I'm going to try to get an emergency scrip for a low dose of seroquel or a sleeping pill. I'd been using my leftover seroquel to conquer any weirdness that flipping my days and nights 100% would bring on. It's a 13-14 hour time difference between the US and China and switching time zones can bring on a mood episode according to my research. 

Sometimes I notice myself being a bit too... boisterous or getting unreasonably irritated, and during those times I take a benadryl to help me sleep. For now, it seems to be working ish. Kinda sucks that I'm the most adventurous of my siblings and I'm the one the most touched by the bipolar fairy's magic dust. Not that I'd wish mania/psychosis on anyone."
bipolar,f05wmkk,t1_ezfkpag,1568421894.0,"Thanks for detailing your own experience and passing on a positive attitude. So many comments and threads in this sub are just full of despair. It's nice to read about your experience. 

I'm sorry to hear about your 9 year olds troubles and I hope he is able to manage his anxieties as time passes and he grows older and into himself. It's good he has a parent who can relate instead of ignoring problems like your parents did. 

I don't know what got me started on that train of thought where I needed reassurance/experiences being shared. Sometimes I just spiral. I think I'd had a couple beers too, which probably didn't help. 

Anyway, thanks again."
bipolar,f05w820,t1_ezfea05,1568421551.0,"Sorry I'm getting back to you late. Your reply was really thoughtful and insightful. I appreciate it a lot. I don't know what got me into that mood where I was scared of having a kid... sometimes I just spiral. I'm sure you can relate. 

I just wanted to say thanks for sharing. 

As for meds, actually, I'm on nothing... Maybe that's not the wisest decision, but I've had extremely bad reactions to antipsychotics and mood stabilizers both, so I currently just monitor my sleep and try my best to avoid extreme stress, which is what happened the other two times. If someone could give me a magic pill that didn't turn me into a zombie or make me have an allergic reaction, maybe I'd take it. For now... I'm just kind of living with the knowledge that I need to be careful and I'm overall very happy and functional."
BipolarReddit,ey7uumy,t3_cvrx13,1566901649.0,"Hey, I'm sorry to hear about that. I too used to want to be in the Peace Corps. I started the application twice and then backed out. I just decided to move abroad myself. I'm curious, what track were you applying for in the PC? If it's education, feel free to PM me with questions about moving abroad and teaching.

Edit: also I don't disclose. Like... ever. On my visa medical check for China, they ask about mental health, I just say, ""nope, I'm healthy"". I know my own capabilities. I know my limits. I'm pretty in tune with my body. I don't feel bad about withholding information, and that's coming from someone with 2 (kind of 3) hospitalizations for severe manic episodes with symptoms of psychosis."
AskReddit,essd4n4,t1_ess7a3p,1562249754.0,Damn. Great reply. Screenshot to make myself feel better. I’m doing fucking great. I moved to China and I have a dog and a boyfriend and I just went to a fancy dinner and wine tasting tonight. For free. Cause my boyfriend manages the bar. Easy to get down on myself. Just fessed up to my roommate that I have untreated bipolar cause we were talking about history. Put me in a weird mood. Anyway. I’m gonna go walk my dog and wake up tomorrow and host a badass event.

Don’t tell her to use toilet paper instead of buying her tampons. That will be your first glimpse of true rage."
