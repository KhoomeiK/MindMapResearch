I'm glad it helped, though, stay safe."
tarotpractice,fos05cj,t3_g99e65,1588021564.0,"No spread, the ace of wands was the card I pulled, then the pulling of two more cards jumped out. 

The question was a general vibe in my relationship with someone. I feel like the three of swords is maybe more of a present situation, but would love other interpretations since I double guess myself every chance I get when it comes to reading for myself."

Psychic,forg8tl,t1_forfdlf,1588011710.0,"Thanks for your comment! I also suffer from bipolar, so I really relate to your experience. This is a low point for me as well, exacerbated by external factors that seem to differ from the signs I'd gotten, so that's an additional hurt. It really feels like this is when I could use the signs and messages moreso, yet here we are. 

That said, thanks again, I hope you find the light finds you soon."
tarot,forfnmy,t3_g8daxz,1588011422.0,"I asked my cards for insight on my relationship with someone and pulled the ace of wands, three of swords, and eight of pentacles. No spread in particular, just the first card pulled and then some clarifiers (I pulled three cards because that's what felt right). 

As always, I have a hard time reading for myself, so I'd love some help interpreting this as a whole message. 

(I feel the three of swords is symbolic of the present, given what's going on between us.)"
Psychic,for8gx2,t1_for7zwz,1588007958.0,"Thank you for your reply and for being so open about this. I can relate to your struggles so much, the traumas and the self harm and addictions, which is I think is part of this entire situation, where I'm angry and sad and just hurting.

My question is what do I need to know to continue my healing (in regards to self acceptance and self love)?  I don't know if there are blockages or something that I need to be pushed through, if that makes sense. Thank you!"
tarot,fo9328y,t3_g6b06p,1587609418.0,I picked the middle and omg it resonated so much and aligned perfectly with my own readings and readings others have told me. It said exactly what I needed and what I knew- great job!

Psychic,fnfggm3,t1_fnf0o2y,1586907582.0,"Look inside and forgiveness! 

This one seems to call out for some introspection, looking deep inside and coming to terms with what it is that's hurting you, that you feel disappointed in, that negative self talk and negative judgement, etc. Remember you're human, you're allowed to feel pain, you're allowed to make mistakes, you're allowed! And for that you should forgive yourself, you're a different person from when you made mistakes, acknowledge all of this and grow from it."
Psychic,fnf5inc,t1_fnezd4r,1586901781.0,"Look inside and create is what I pulled for you. 

This is a call for you to look inside yourself to find the answers, the love, the light. That's how you'll be able to create and invite opportunities, received and experience play and pleasure and fun. You'll find the way to bring happiness to yourself, which everyone can always use more of!"
Psychic,fnf4z36,t1_fney3ja,1586901497.0,"Mirror (evaluate how you see yourself) and distinguish (the real from unreal)! 

When you look at yourself, keep in mind that not everything you see is true, so work on finding the difference between the real and unreal- you should feel good about yourself! You may not see all the truths of the good things about yourself- but they're there!!! Feel good about yourself!"
Psychic,fnf2i8b,t1_fney267,1586900209.0,"I pulled forgiveness for you, as well as liberation. 

Clear yourself of negative self judgement and negative self criticism (forgiveness). Live for yourself, accept who you are, appreciate yourself (liberation). 

This is a call for you to love yourself, forgive yourself, you're only human and you're allowed to let go of what hurts and your disappointments. Let go and be free of these things that are hurting you, accept yourself and recognize you're grown, it's all hindsight and you know now what you know, yes, but that doesn't mean you can't forgive yourself."
Psychic,fnf0om6,t1_fnexx65,1586899270.0,"Hi! I pulled commitment and gentle. 
Commitment: the dedication to the truth about yourself, how your actions and thoughts and choices affect yourself. Gentle: showing kindness to yourself and being understanding of your current situation. 

This altogether seems like a reminder that what you do affects you (obviously) in ways you may not think about, as it may also affect others who love you. Yes, live life for yourself, but consider others as well. The primary focus here, I believe, is showing kindness to yourself and the thought of the butterfly effect comes to mind. Be gentle with yourself and keep in mind everything that's going on, as you're only human."
Psychic,fnezq8y,t1_fnew4uh,1586898797.0,"Hello! I pulled recognition and resilience for you! Recognition being the acknowledgment of your individual qualities, which we unique to you. Resilience being the ability to rely on yourself! 

This altogether calls for you to acknowledge and recognize that you've gotten yourself through all the bad things in life, you've relied on yourself, you've pulled yourself through, and that's absolutely something to be proud of!"
Psychic,fneyzta,t1_fnex5p1,1586898429.0,"I pulled honor and dignity for you! Honor being making choices that are good for you, true to your higher self, being proud of yourself, and behaving with dignity. So it's funny that I pulled dignity also (the degree to which you hold yourself in high regard)! 

The meaning overall seems to be that you should focus more on making good decisions for yourself! The issue may be that you may be lacking in the self love aspect, re: how you view yourself, so please focus on loving yourself more and showing that love to yourself :)"
Psychic,fnexsn8,t1_fnewvk1,1586897821.0,"Hi! I got believe for you, which is for you to believe you're worthy of love and good things! And mirror, which is a call for you to have a positive image of how you view yourself, either physically or emotionally or spiritually. 

This to me seems to say that you should really see how it is you view yourself, a call for it to be in a more positive manner! You're worthy of everything good that's going on, don't let doubts and negativity get in the way of you believing it. This also seems to be a call for you to be kinder to yourself and how you possibly may talk to yourself!"
Psychic,fnex6fv,t1_fnew2le,1586897508.0,"For you i pulled believe and resilience. 

Believe being that you should believe that you are worthy and deserving of good things, both that you have and what is coming your way. Resilience, the ability of rely on yourself as the master of your own life. 

This to me seems like a reminder that you're strong, you can rely on yourself to make it through everything that's come your way and that when it's over, you're deserving of everything you've earned. Stay strong, while you can't control what comes your way, you can choose what to focus on and choose to rely upon yourself and keep going!"
Psychic,fnewfu7,t1_fnev7uz,1586897129.0,"Hi! I pulled distinguish and honor for you! 

Honor being making choices that honor yourself and your higher self, encouraging you to behave with dignity of which you're deserving. Distinguish being able to distinguish the real from unreal in your life. 

This seems to be a call for you to look into yourself, distinguish what you really are vs what you believe (in the sense of insecurities and negative self talk) and begin acting upon the positive and honoring yourself in the way you deserve."
Psychic,fnevvhy,t1_fnev74s,1586896832.0,"I pulled commitment and freedom! 

Commitment being your dedication to finding the truth about yourself, your thought, actions, choices and how they affect you and others around you. Freedom being freedom of expression without being apologetic of who you are. 

This combination to me is a call for you to evaluate what you may be doing that's preventing your freedom of expression, see if you're holding yourself back from something and what may be causing it. The encouragement is to allow the real you to shine!"

You‚Äôve come a long way, Pile 1, though it may not seem so. You may feel like a failure, like you‚Äôre having setbacks, maybe you feel as if you‚Äôve hit rock bottom.¬† There‚Äôs a sense of weariness and sadness and a bit of hopelessness.¬† But you‚Äôve come far, and the universe wants you to know that. Stand tall!! Stand proud of how far you‚Äôve made it!!!¬† The universe wants to help you, you‚Äôve just gotta keep going and don‚Äôt give up.¬† Continue being strong and brave and moving forward; you‚Äôre finding your purpose, the thing that lights you up inside and gives you that satisfaction of being alive. You‚Äôre on your way there and the universe supports you.¬† A new perspective might help, just remember to honor your heart as you make your priorities clear.¬† Prioritize yourself.¬† Really.¬† Focus on yourself.¬† It‚Äôs okay to care about other things and other people, but you‚Äôre at the center of it all.¬† It‚Äôs okay to focus on yourself a little more.¬† Fill your cup.¬† Everything is still in process.¬† Keep going.¬† You have every right and reason to feel hopeful right now.¬† Once again!, you are supported.¬† You‚Äôre close!¬† All you really have to do now is that that leap of faith, keep up the courage, let go of your fears, keep taking these steps, and you‚Äôll see that things will just fall into place for you, just as you wish.¬†

Be kind to yourself and take each day one at a time, there‚Äôs no shame in that.¬†¬†

Citrine 2: http://imgur.com/a/dlEJLHs 
 You‚Äôre feeling a bit stuck right now, Pile 2, caught up in the same ol‚Äô routine.¬† Look beyond this routine, look deep down, inside yourself.¬† Explore your inner self, what you feel, what you want, what makes you happy.¬† Be mindful of this, because the further your explore, the more you‚Äôll find the power inside you.¬† Your gifts are growing and will continue to do so.¬† These lessons, what you find as you introspect and what you experience in your day to day life- they‚Äôre essential.¬† Call it fertilizer- you‚Äôre a blossoming flower and these lessons can be shit, but they help you grow.¬† Growing pains, if you will!¬† Unfortunately, sometimes pain is necessary for change and you just have to face it. But don‚Äôt let these lessons distract you from the goal, the growth, don‚Äôt let them get you down.¬† You‚Äôre embarking on a soul-searching journey, on the brink of new beginnings, and all these gifts you‚Äôll discover you have and you will soon be able to share them with the world! You‚Äôre doing amazing in your transformation. A caterpillar who‚Äôs made it into their cocoon, now you just gotta keep growing and transforming, and soon you‚Äôll emerge as a beautiful butterfly.¬† Take some time for yourself, away from whatever has you feeling a bit stuck, taking great care of yourself, inside and out.¬† You‚Äôre beginning what‚Äôs going to be a wonderful journey, what comes to mind as a scenic drive, where you‚Äôre enjoying yourself with no mind to the length and the end of the road, because what matters is what you see along the drive.

Be kind to yourself, let yourself smell your roses and find happiness in the little things.

Pile 3, it seems as though you haven‚Äôt had the easiest route in life.¬† It‚Äôs making you uncertain, maybe, just about everything.¬† It‚Äôs been hard, it has, but you‚Äôve made it this far and you‚Äôve done great.¬† You‚Äôve faced traumas, unexpected ones it seems, and I‚Äôm so, so sorry for that.¬† I hate the expression that everything happens for a reason, because it seems unfair sometimes.¬† But unfortunately, sometimes you have no choice but to go down these hard routes, rocky and uneven, dark and long, only hoping that the destination is a good one.¬† And it really feels like that‚Äôs the case here- like these hardships are really helping you discover yourself.¬† You‚Äôre beginning to understand yourself, to find a harmony and balance in your heart and mind.¬† You‚Äôre taking control of your life!¬† Really just gripping the bull by the horns, I believe is the expression.¬† You had no hand in what has happened to you and that‚Äôs okay.¬† The universe is calling to tell you that it‚Äôs okay and that you should release the pain to let yourself move on.¬† You owe yourself that much, an ode to all you‚Äôve survived.¬† Trust your intuition.¬† Prosperity is on its way for you, new beginnings, abundance, your dreams coming to fruition.¬† And remember that as your journey of self-love and spiritual growth comes to an end- appreciate the payoff, but be especially appreciative of the hard work you did to get yourself there.¬†

Be kind to yourself, you‚Äôre on the right path!!!!!

Sunstone I think 4: http://imgur.com/a/AkrnaI4
Oh my darling Pile 4, my heart goes out to you.¬† You‚Äôre struggling, that much is clear.¬† Battles with depression and mental illness, addiction maybe; all things that make you feel low and trapped and I truly hope this message finds you when it should.¬† Remember, amidst this chaos, victory and positive changes and outcomes are still very, very much possible.¬† As cliche as it is, there is absolutely a light at the end of the tunnel.¬† It‚Äôs coming, no denying there, you just have to keep going.¬† Make loving commitments to yourself, intend on your victory to happen, and make it happen, take that initiative.¬† You‚Äôre transforming!¬† And as you transform and transition, keep yourself grounded, trust your intuition.¬† You, your truth, your gifts, they‚Äôre all emerging and they‚Äôre shining. Be careful, please, that you say kind things to yourself, because you embody what you articulate.¬† If you say you‚Äôre a bad person, you feel like a bad person, even when others know you aren‚Äôt.¬† If you say you‚Äôre strong and capable, then you‚Äôll acknowledge these truths.¬† You‚Äôre growing, you‚Äôre getting there.¬† I know it‚Äôs hard to accept and believe that good things are coming your way, sometimes the darkness just really clouds your perspective, and makes you afraid to hope, to be let down, as you‚Äôve been let down before.¬† But trust me, good things are coming your way.¬† One day you‚Äôll shine, you‚Äôll be radiant, you‚Äôll be so grateful of being alive, of not having given up.¬† One day, when your darkness and trauma is no longer the driving force behind your life, you‚Äôll look back at this period with awe and amazement of how far you‚Äôve come and what you‚Äôve survived.¬†

Be kind to yourself.¬† Be patient, keep going, and don‚Äôt be afraid to hope

Opalite 5: http://imgur.com/a/EJUJ5oz 
You‚Äôre nearing the light, Pile 5!¬† Approaching the end of the tunnel, new beginnings on the horizon.¬† There‚Äôs such a sense of new energy here.¬† You‚Äôre definitely on the right path- stay focused, keep doing what you‚Äôre doing.¬† Be kind, positive, optimistic.¬† Be present in the now, pay no mind to the external forces that seem to interfere, that seem to cause you to miss opportunities. This path you‚Äôve walked isn‚Äôt one you‚Äôve wanted to walk, you‚Äôre tired.¬† It‚Äôs been long and maybe the road has seemed endless, and you‚Äôve grown weary.¬† And that‚Äôs okay, truly.¬† It was one you had to walk, though, and hopefully you‚Äôll understand why soon.¬† Know that the darkness can be transmuted, hopefully you‚Äôve seen it happen, and know that it will continue to happen.¬† Release old stories, old troubles, whatever is holding you back, the bits of the darkness that are still clinging to you.¬† If you continue to be fearful, you‚Äôll have a bit of a hard time moving past your limits, do what you need to despite these fears.¬† Name your troubles, your traumas, make them easier to control.¬† Focus on your yearnings, on your wants.¬† And know you don‚Äôt have to walk this road alone.¬† Stay connected, accept love and support.¬† Yes, you‚Äôve carried yourself this far, you‚Äôve done it on your own.¬† But you don‚Äôt have to, it‚Äôs okay to abandon that mindset, let people in and let them help and support you.¬†¬†

Be kind to yourself, let others help you carry the load as you approach the end of your journey.

Amethyst point 6:  http://imgur.com/a/4vbOCVo
It‚Äôs a call for celebration, group 6! Be happy, be proud, excited!¬† The energy coming from this deck is blinding and bright and beautiful.¬† All of your hard work- it‚Äôs paying off!¬† Be grateful of the present you find yourself in. Acknowledge and understand the lessons you‚Äôve experienced, and how they‚Äôve helped you in finding yourself. Continue being mindful, don‚Äôt overthink the calls you receive, and keep up this amazing work.¬† You‚Äôll find yourself so happy with the choices you‚Äôve made.¬† This pile is such an absolute messenger of good news, emotional nourishment, just wonderful, wonderful things so close you can taste them. There‚Äôs also a screaming sense here of creative projects- either coming to light or being accomplished; it‚Äôs a bit of a theme here that is bugging me to be mentioned.¬† It feels like you‚Äôve maybe been working on some sort of life venture and your work is paying off! Be patient and kind to yourself as you manifest your desires.¬† You‚Äôve grown a lot, your skills are much greater, be grateful of your work and the success you‚Äôre facing.¬† Not ignoring the 333, the universe wants you to know that your prayers have been heard- and that they‚Äôre being answered.¬†¬†

Be kind to yourself and be grateful and as proud of yourself as I am of you.¬†

This particular milestone was extra big, since I was going to kill myself 27 days ago and postponed it for today.  But right now, I'm self harm free and want to continue the streak, and I desperately want to keep living and seeing what life has in store for me :')"
