Lots of speech and language therapy (SALT) techniques online to help with speech, the basics are read daily with them, narrate your day, do simple q&A's and give them time to mimic/respond. Try and get your son to watch you speak. I find mine attempts more when I can get him focused on my face.

1st step would be a hearing test to rule out glue ear or any other heading defects then a referral to SALT

A SALT therapist will assess your son to see if there are any under lying pathologies behind the delay or whether it's going to happen just needs a bit of work. 

As soon as lockdown is over I'm putting my toddler into nursery for a day a week to help with speech development, might be something you can consider?"
