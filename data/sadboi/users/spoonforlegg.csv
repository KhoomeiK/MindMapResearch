Persona 5 is also an amazing game and I recommend any fan of JRPGs play it. Based on what you've been playing so far, the turned based combat of Persona 5 might feel a little different at first. The pacing is also a lot slower. Im also a huge fan of a couple games you listed tho, like Fallout New Vegas and Diablo 3. 85 dollars sounds way too expensive for Persona 5 tho. I still highly recommend playing it. Its a very well crafted game even if you dont like traditional RPG elements."
