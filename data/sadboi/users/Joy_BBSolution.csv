REDDITORSINRECOVERY,faa2pks,t3_e8a0w1,1575900556.0,Going to meetings everyday won’t keep a person sober. Forced sobriety without the spiritual experience will actually make the alcoholic crazier.

The main thing is that I was able to get my life back AND it wasn't that I got my old life back, I got a brand new life that is filled with purpose. It's so clear now that being the perfect size just doesn't matter. All that thinking was blocking me off to bigger and better things."
OvereatersAnonymous,f62n08h,t1_f62m982,1572663083.0,"the great thing about the program is that you get to choose your own conception of God. Have you ever been in a bad situation where you prayed to God in desperation? Deep down in every single one of us we have that Power. It's just a matter of tapping into it. That's what the steps teach us. If you're desperate, its honestly a pretty easy decision."
OvereatersAnonymous,f62lrei,t1_f62ldv9,1572662219.0,I remember what life was like prior to program and there is no way I want to go back to that. Compulsive eating had a really intense hold over my life and my solution has to be equally as powerful.

EatingDisorders,f55wgz6,t3_dmva69,1572014809.0,There is a 12-step fellowship for the family and friends of people with eating disorders. It’s called O-Anon. Even an Al-Anon meeting would help.

EDAnonymous,f3lqcge,t3_dh9wdv,1570978573.0,"I used to hide it from my husband too because it’s so embarrassing. Thankfully, I found a way out of the compulsive eating life. I’ve been free of the obsession since 2017. PM me if you wanna chat about it."
EatingDisorders,f3grhoq,t3_dgx7a9,1570914457.0,The more I focused on my weight in recovery the crazier I got. I realized that part of my compulsion around food was the constant weight obsession and if I hit that magic number on the scale that all of a sudden my life would be amazing. What I found was even when I did hit that number I was still a crazy person. I haven’t lived that way for over 2 years and I’m finally free. Pm me and let me know if I can help.
