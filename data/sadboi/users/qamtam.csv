The other scenario that's painful for me is anticipation of the high-stakes environment. I get extremely anxious about performance and get anxious and choked as a result even if I'm competent - I had to take a driving license test over a dozen times, for example. What counter routines would you recommend for these two scenarios?"
Anxiety,fo1zl1x,t3_g4y8e7,1587445409.0,"This is one of those 'I'm in this picture and I don't like it' moments.

My thing was being good at math and mental calculation. To put it short - I enjoyed not only excelling but also being strictly better at math than enybody I met without nearly any effort. Then I passed the nation-wide tests for math in high school in flying colors and got accepted to best CS faculty of the country. Definitely did put too many belief eggs in a single basket, as on the first lecture and first exercise classes I felt like everybody was speaking Chinese. I was shattered. Everybody understood everything and I didn't. To add to the injury the class was literally called 'Introduction to Mathematics' (to this day, if I see a Hebrew sign I just spew hate instantly).

A couple months later filled with intense self-hating sessions and about a year of diagnozed depression later I believed that I was good for nothing and dumb and a failure. Even now, seven years later I still don't think my brain is even in the 'usable' category even though I changed the school to just ever-so-slightly less prestigious, passed through it fairly well and got complimented by few during exchanges. Funnily enough, even in multiplayer games now I just seek roles that will free me of final score responsibility (think Zen in Overwatch). Now in quarantine I'm trying to put together some resemblance of actual skills that are in demand to get a job and I'm really anxious if I'm good enough (in all senses) to get accepted (to frankly most anything) as perspective of staying a man-child forever terrifies me.

The good news is that this toxic mindset must be changable (if it can change one way, it can change the other too just as neural networks evolve with new data). I actually had a fascinating discussion on reddit with somebody that pinpointed the root of my problems and recommend the book Mindset (by Carol Dweck). Holy crap, this book just described my entire personality with a sniper-like precision. More importantly, it gave me a framework and tools to incrementally change beliefs to growth. Hopefully it will be enough to launch me to self-sufficiency soon."

getdisciplined,fcire5x,t1_fcccv3r,1577668017.0,"Wow. I just wanted to say thank you for the time and effort that was required of you to share that wisdom. It's a shame, really, that a post this good will be buried beneath the not-so-attractive OP. You have quite a way with words.

What especially struck me was the first book from your recommended list.

From Mindset:

>Dweck explains why it’s not just our abilities and talent that bring us success—but whether we approach them with a fixed or growth mindset. She makes clear why praising intelligence and ability doesn’t foster self-esteem and lead to accomplishment, but may actually jeopardize success. 

I guess that would be why being praised through years for me being apparently naturally good with numbers and calculations in my early days (and being told I'm smart) really backfired when I couldn't do anything near required with no effort when taking these super tough abstract math courses on my first two attempts and why breaking afterwards was so destructive. I never really was even close to failing before.

It really is curious that you've also predicted me being defensive on the subject of having a fixed mindset, as I indeed have gottendefensive  immediately after reading it (a few hours flew by since). Because although cognitively I agree with you 100%, I can't help but feel that shifting from a fixed (or near-fixed, otherwise I wouldn't even be asking and searching) mindset to a growth mindset will be difficult (as you said yourself) if you are not already having it - which makes it a kind of catch 22. That's why I'm searching specifically for methods that would somehow help with breaking that loop (on surface disconnecting the ego, but also to change to growth mindset as you've pointed out). Filling the mind with useful and positive information would probably be on top of my list, too, but in my case it probably isn't yet enough.

Since this is public (even though buried), I don't see why I shouldn't share what I've tried, too, with varying degrees of success:

\- using sticky notes when planning my day to think not only about the activities that need to be done, but also what beliefs I'm actually building in myself in the long run (so if I plan to go for a jog the next day, for example, I'm also starting to build a belief that 'I'm an active person' or 'I'm worthwhile in my own opinion because I take care about myself'. That way I can stop thinking about activities I usually dread because they are unpleasant and start thinking of them as a way to up the beliefs I desire (including having a growth mindset). I would place the stickies on a separate piece of paper and then attaching them back to my journal as a reward and physical reminder that I did contribute to that belief. It actually did work really well, but I stopped a couple weeks back when I've gotten sick. This seems like a good opportunity to jump back.

\- getting into a habit of going for a walk directly before tackling the hard material and visualising how I would go about that (including breaks, tea, frustration when stuck etc. but coming out victorious in the end and visualising feeling good about that to), and then after going back and replicating that visualisation as closely as I can. That way I actually get to do the stuff at least in my head and coming out alright, as a bonus there is also building up of a belief that 'I can do whatever I put my mind towards' (literally).

\- starting a day on the right foot (so no browsing reddit or /d/ in the morning). It does help tremendously with doing two points above, but though simple it is not easy.

Thanks again, I guess I'm going to remind myself about your philosophy really often and try to employ it the best I can. Hopefully, the 'can' will get better with time."
getdisciplined,fbxtb94,t3_eeul88,1577199944.0,"Generally I would agree that life with purpose is better than one without one.

What I don't get is what you are supposed to do when you fail in the thing you are supposed to be good at and was your purpose beforehand and you actually got attached to it.

Most of my life I was good at math, better than the others and that I was told I am pretty smart - that's what I based my personality and self-worth on. Than I got accepted to the university and failed miserably, despite giving my all. Twice. Ever since I essentially hated myself millennial-style and thought myself worthless. 


Now, a couple years later I'm getting depressed over my thesis at the other school and to say I feel miserable is an understatement - I actually start to clench my fist at random and twitch from the nerves and anxiety about thinking to fail everybody. Even thinking to sit down and get to work is physically painful. My energy levels are so low it is kind of a joke. I wake up at 2 PM and basically am chronically tired before getting myself to sleep at 3 AM, between crying, masturbating, browsing 2meirl4meirl and sitting on twitch.

I get depressed and fail to get the job done not because I might be unable to complete it, but because I might be unable to complete it despite trying, so I am kind of sabotaging myself and agonizing both when I am doing it and when I am not to at least have the excuse that I failed because I'm lazy but at least not dumb and in the end not really trying. This is ridiculous when stated in writing, but I got burned so bad by my experience that I don't give it my all in any department to protect the shreds of my ego left (and fail in most anything I try).


Kind of rambling, but I am also really lost, so if you would have some kind of an advice for my particular situation, I'm all ears."

You will be able to do like 2X more than usual (even my fat ass can get like 30 and usually I would struggle with fewer than 10) and at the last few ones the adrenaline will be PUMPIN. You do as many as you can, then get up, take a big breath in and hold it.

You literally won't be able to worry for  a good chunk of time (as you get a little high from air itself and feel really super good). Turns out, worrying about the lack of air trumps everything other worry and when you are done with that you aren't worrying physically."

CGPGrey,f87ryxt,t3_dysq2x,1574341134.0,"Great episode; the last segment on language reminded me of my old language grudge. I think that lawyer-talk is unreadable, too, but not nearly as much as in scientific subjects. If you give a legal document to a relatively smart 12-year-old there is some hope. If you give any math proof or even any simple science concept that is based in symbols there is no hope.

And it's not because it is so darn complicated. It's also the case, but really, if you think that lawyer-talk is a whole other language, then science-talk is the language of actual aliens. I have a degree, but I swear to god, every time I have to read through a paper on any subject even if it COULD be written in a human-readable form it is specifically twisted and turned  to make it harder to understand. I loathe to having to write the papers, because I have to turn a simple idea that can be explained in 5-10 minutes into a slew of symbols, otherwise it won't be accepted. Don't even get me started on 'symboling rules' (not the actual math) for derivatives and integrals. Really, we had like 300 years to come up with something better, there has to be something.

I think it is somewhat of an actual issue. Science is pretty cool and there is probably a niche in it that would make a newbie passionate about some subject. Let's say that I'm a statistician and for whatever reason I want sometimes to learn something about a subject out of my depth, like on long-distance energy transportation. There are papers on that, but good luck trying to read that. Now, try the same for somebody that is not initiated to science-talk. Even if the person is specifically interested in the subject, they'll bounce off of the literature even if it is strictly explainable (take Brilliant as an okay example). Amplify that by the fact that most papers (even if you understand them) are impressively curated to be mind-numbingly dry with 0 humor or stories that could make a mnemonic anchor.

The floof of lawyer-talk is exactly the opposite to science. There is an excessive push for conciseness mixed with excessive love for symbols (that have multiple meanings, depending on context by the way) of other alphabets. Makes you wonder if we'll end up with extra cirillic or binary symbols in a few decades to make proofs even more concise and unreadable. I think that this sort of snobishness is unhelpful outside of top of the academia (making most students from high school to university loathe most of the science subjects), but even then it would be a good exercise to have a noob-friendly abstract that forces the tenured professors to think about how to explain the subject to new people."

So I decided a few days ago to just go with my notebook (a paper one) to the library with no electronics - it was a wonderful experience and I got a lot done.

It appears to me that buybacks aren't giving much value if I'm just sitting with the shares for the long haul (perhaps outliving the company), maybe besides slightly increasing the 'size' of the share and making them more valuable for some time (but being seemingly inconsequential if company, as a whole, fails).
