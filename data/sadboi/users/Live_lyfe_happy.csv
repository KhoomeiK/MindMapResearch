Unfortunately the story fell pretty flat, alot of characters were as deep as a puddle and it had useless fan service in alot of places. The only thing for me it had going for it was the animation. Overall this show felt generic and was a Jack of all trades, master of none."

patientgamers,fb995ds,t3_ebxcbf,1576632577.0,"Disappointing: 

The Division.

I promised myself after that game I'd never overhype myself for another game again. The game just wasn't genuinely fun and having played Destiny for a couple years prior, it just lacked in every department. With that being said I felt like majority of the reason I was disappointed in this game was my fault, I didn't bother trying to understand what it was trying to do, because what I thought it was going be made me ignore all news telling us about it.... I assumed it was going to give us a gigantic open map like DayZ, but story driven with PvE and PvP alike with it being alot more polished then DayZ and in a well know location.

Sleeping Dogs.

I tried legit 5 times to get into this game, and I just never could. I didn't like any of the characters the, setting was boring and everything besides the fighting maybe, felt so floaty and cheaply made. I'm probably wrong, who knows, but I refuse to install and boot up that game again lol.


Surprising:

Mass Effect 3.

When it first released I was more casual in gaming and alot of good games passed me by, including this one. I never heard anything about the series before then and when I booted it up I hated the controls, It took me forcing myself to get use to them a 2nd time to realize such a amazing story, I was hooked from start to finish after that. I loved the atmosphere, the characters and setting and I felt so invested in my Shepherd's journey, I ended up playing through the rest of the games and it's one of my favorite series of all time now. 

Witcher 3.

I wasn't a fan of medieval setting or the fantasy genre, but after convincing myself to play it due to how much of a true open world it looked I decided why not. It's not my favorite series or even game of all time, but I enjoyed every min of my playthrough for it and would play it again."

Trying to scramble to get the PS4, it was sold out everywhere, Xbox was too, except for the last X1 Walmart had in stock. I caved and bought it, and I don't think I'd ever regret buying this thing, I enjoyed it ever since."

TitansTV,f6it2n8,t1_f6dknxq,1572883928.0,"That's what I was thinking, especially the point, ""They all just forgot Deathstroke was trying to kill them."" Of course we seen that Deathstroke's (possibly Jericho) motive wasn't to kill them, but nobody knew that and they still don't, just Dick knows after going to the wife's house.... Also, most if not all the team don't have any place to blame Dick for everything he was confessing about. The original Titans all did something to help lead to Jericho's death. 

Season 1 imo wasn't ground breaking, but atleast it was consistently average to good throughout the season. Season 2 only had 1 *maybe* 2 episodes that were good so far, the rest has been meh or awful."

From this point on you can start to change that feeling you had, for your next graduation or if any type of college isn't your thing, you will not have to be forced to be around people you don't want to for the majority of your day, you can start doing things you love and meeting people with the same interests. Both of these paths require a bit of hard work though, mostly within yourself. The only other person you're left with at the end of the day is you with your thoughts, try to be happy for that person learn to love them, then you will be able to not care if people clap for you are not, but also you will find friends who will, because of your new found happiness.
