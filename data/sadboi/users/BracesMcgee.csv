depression,fqe7uu0,t1_fqb60b9,1589303179.0,"You're right . We can always have it worse. I'm sorry to hear that, but know that from what you've said, I care about you. I have been through a time in my life where I didn't have anyone to talk to and I know how grating it can be. But the fact that you are still here despite going through it makes you a really strong person. I know its easier said than done, but try and see your worth from no one's eyes but your own. It doesn't matter what anyone thinks about you if you don't feel good about yourself. So thats the focus. I'm still trying to learn it myself to be honest."

depression,fq8ckvz,t3_gh7hqm,1589163147.0,Man i feel you. This happened to me but with my ex. 2 years of driving 30 mins to her house whenever she needed a shoulder to cry on but when i fell into deep depression and opened up she left me.
depression,fq8cb95,t3_ghdi7l,1589162975.0,"This is what can make it hard to speak to friends about my problems. I feel like they might not understand why i feel so bad. I guess i was once like them too, or i just did a better job of ignoring the depression"
depression,fq8bgna,t3_gha0sp,1589162438.0,"Haha can relate. Am 20 and have reccurring fantasy of leaving all my shit behind and becoming a travelling bum. Nothing more than a knapsack, dog, and hitchhiking on freight trains or something. Of course im romanticising being homeless but still. To just be free...."
TheMidnightGospel,foqewcl,t1_fofo5fj,1587991908.0,Your right but it didn't feel right for him to be so negligent to his own faults. Just my view on it
TheMidnightGospel,foqetuv,t1_fog9uk6,1587991859.0,Yeah exactly. It seemed like he was written to be way too oblivious to his own faults

WeAreTheMusicMakers,evrblmt,t3_ckpfkw,1564704937.0,"Put an EQ on the master and cut all frequencies from 50 hz down. A lot of those low frequencies use up a lot or energy and you cant really hear it so its wasted energy that could be going to more important frequencies. 

I sometimes cut from as high as 80hz"

WeAreTheMusicMakers,erdeg7j,t3_c18gc3,1560739349.0,"I’m afraid there’s no real cure to the doubt you’ll have when it comes to making music full time. 
However just flipping your perspective a bit might help. You could end up having to get a job and keep music as a hobby, making music in your room and playing local shows. But if you love what you do that shouldn’t be a problem! Lots of artists who make it big miss the grind, miss the small shows and miss the privacy. There’s ups and downs for every path in life, just don’t get too worked up on the one you end up on"
