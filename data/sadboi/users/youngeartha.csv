BPD,fqx77j4,t3_gl6xfh,1589727320.0,"I am very very similar! I am rly picky about who I like and end up ghosting so many people because they don't fit the mold of what i'm looking for but when I DO find that person...UGH. I literally cannot stop thinking about them. I am completely fixated on them and spiral out of control if they take longer than 5 min to respond to me. I've noticed my worst BPD symptoms come when I really like somebody new. The ""talking"" stage is the hardest, most painful time for me because of how strong my emotions are. But I can NEVER let them know how obsessive I truly am so I keep it wayyy under wraps. If only they knew how unhinged I can really be LOL. I wouldn't say I necessarily go for ""bad"" people or am attracted to red flags -- basically the opposite. I idealize people I see as ""healthy"" and ""good"" for me.

Edit: I also fantasize incessantly about our future--living together, our future children's names, traveling with them. I'm like omg youngeartha calm tf down, you barely know this person!!!"

Blue Squirrel

I love this brush SO much. When it comes to everyday makeup it‚Äôs a staple as I usually am rushing in the morning and it‚Äôs great for laying a single color all over my eyes. However, I also will use it to deepen the crease/add transition and apply shadow to bottom lash line as well. It blends immediately and effortlessly and although it is one of the softest brushes I own it still lays down the perfect amount of product without being TOO sheer. 

It‚Äôs definitely a larger eye brush so better for large eyelids (I have pretty good eye / eyelid real estate) but honestly it‚Äôs so soft and multifunctional I think anyone could use it! The way it‚Äôs shaped it can apply in targeted places but obviously more suited to all over application. Powder only, seeing as it is blue squirrel. 

If anyone has similar brushes/brush shapes, let me know! I love the Sonia G jumbo blender from her sky eye set as it has sooorta similar properties (except it‚Äôs dyed saikoho goat and denser) and I had my eye on the S121 from Hakuhodo (also blue squirrel)."
AmItheAsshole,fk5xkif,t3_fgg4k4,1583889744.0,"NTA. These comments are shocking me. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs HER BODY so her choice. She is almost 18 and I believe she has the right to make that choice. Her Dad has no right belittling her over that. It‚Äôs not even permanent like plastic surgery‚Äî your body breaks down hyaluronic acid fillers in as little as 6 months. He‚Äôll live. Should you have mentioned it to him? Sure. At least a hey, heads up, this is what we‚Äôre doing today with money she‚Äôs saved up. But I don‚Äôt think they have a right to shame/prevent her from doing something to her own face, even if she‚Äôs one year ‚Äúunderage.‚Äù

EDIT: People don‚Äôt know the difference between plastic surgery and fillers. Fillers are non-surgical and non-permanent. I didn‚Äôt even numb when I got my lips done. This is far from going under the knife."

BPD,fjdu0hx,t3_fcrfpo,1583259231.0,I feel this so much. My mom often does this when we have arguments. Partners have also used this line of thinking to shut me down and invalidate what I have to say. It's so frustrating and dehumanizing.
AmItheAsshole,fjdr1qo,t3_fcvpq1,1583257580.0,"YTA. This sounds fake, that's how assholish this is. You are racist, an asshole, and need therapy tbh because this way of thinking is what is toxic and needs to be unpacked."
fudebrushes,fixddlt,t3_fac58e,1582818146.0,"This was a great, in depth review. I'll admit I wasn't really interested in her brushes till I read this and now it seems to be too late to get these natural haired ones! Also the price tag hurts, haha. Do we know why she switched to synthetic? Is it just due to the demand of ""cruelty free"" and anti-natural hair sentiments of the West?"
fudebrushes,fiwctcf,t1_fiu7mn5,1582781461.0,"Thank you so much for the recommendation! I will definitely pick one up at only $10. Nothing wrong with a cheap brush, my teacher also uses the Ecotools Blending and Bronzing brush with the foundation which I believe is $10 as well. I'm excited!"
fudebrushes,fiwco88,t1_fislmjg,1582781334.0,"I actually think it is the same brush! When I google it, that brush you uploaded comes up on people's blog posts. I'm guessing this is one of those situations where Hakuhodo's picture on the website is not very clear with its true size and shape (in this case you can't even see the duo fibers very clearly at all,) which happens often if I just go with the pictures on the website lol. But if you are interested in parting with it, feel free to message me! I ended up poshmarking an original Mac 159 but I know Hakuhodo's will be inevitably better and I did want a larger version as well."
fudebrushes,fiqtchf,t1_fiplb6b,1582651363.0,"Funny you say that! I was doing some digging last night and I found the [J544](https://hakuhodousa.com/products/j544bksl-duo-fibre-powder-liquid-round-flat) which is duo-fiber and similar to the Mac 159 (and similar in shape to the J5543,) except longer and thicker.

However the most similar brushes seem to be the G544, and even moreso the smaller G545 (with almost the same dimensions), BOTH being discontinued :( If anyone is trying to get these off their hands, I'll take it! Otherwise, the larger J544 is my best bet from what I've found so far."
fudebrushes,fip3p9u,t3_f92v71,1582597340.0,I‚Äôm so sad Mac only has full synthetic now and my makeup teacher recommended this to apply the RCMA foundation I just ordered. I know of Hakuhodo‚Äôs angled synthetic brushes that I‚Äôm interested in for cream blushes but I want more of this shape for foundation.
crochet,fib2ng2,t3_f7byd1,1582313366.0,I saw her post this in a Facebook group and got super inspired! Looks like it will take forever but once full size SO worth it. I love the colors as well!

And afterwards I don't think they truly understood the pain I felt and that I was just trying to get off of work. I just remember thinking if this is how I felt everyday I'd want to be euthanized. I still haven't gone to a gastro because my job manipulates me into not taking off atm due to understaffing and I cry about it sometimes.

I'm also young (about to turn 24) so I know that pain, especially as someone who has always loved food and eating out. I've had heartburn for a few years now but ever since a 12 hour episode of gastritis and the worst pain i've ever had in my life a few weeks ago, basically everything I eat leads to stomach pain, heartburn and nausea. I can't get a day off of work to go see a gastro due to us being short staffed (thanks capitalism!) so I'm basically just surviving until I can find an appointment on a day off.
