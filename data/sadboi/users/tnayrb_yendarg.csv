2007scape,fk2am90,t1_fk2abz4,1583796752.0,I guess that's what I get for playing on mobile... I would have definitely noticed that on runelite.

runescape,f7aewlu,t1_f79ah9f,1573527536.0,That last part sounds kinda like Albion online.
depression,f5o3xj9,t3_doh9id,1572309489.0,"No, not today buddy. I felt that way on my bday and had exams the next week. It's been 19 days since my bday and im still here. Still sucks. But I'm still here though.."
depression,f5o3ezj,t3_dohca2,1572309168.0,Na stay here. I feel the same way. I'm all out of answers. But I'm waiting for hope too. I think depression is this nasty feeling that confuses us. It's okay. Just hold on alright?
depression,f4sxfl8,t3_dlfw2v,1571781765.0,Yup.
runescape,f3mrpc0,t3_dhdeej,1570991490.0,"My gf didn't like the tick system, how you would have to spam click for your character to move and it would be delayed or your character would just run wherever making combat difficult. She also said there's too much going on and that she didn't really know what was going on content wise lol because basically the whole community is maxed. She also didn't like how the game changes so frequently, something unnecessary changing every week making the game hard to learn. And MTX."
runescape,f38cmk7,t3_dg0pga,1570735378.0,Lol I laughed too hard at this
depression,f2styux,t3_de5zh3,1570386984.0,"I feel this exact way.. but, I'm gonna keep trying because idk.. my perspective may change one day idk. keep trying with me you're not alone."
runescape,f2nj8te,t3_ddqo7k,1570316707.0,I'm all for looking at the positive side of things but we can't be in denial...Jagex needs to unfuck themselves and you need to wake up.
2007scape,f1w1bfo,t3_daw0hn,1569778875.0,Hahahahahaha!!! Nice!
depression,f1q1uny,t3_dai13u,1569691954.0,I can promise it will be okay. Just hold on and understand everyone has a different pace in life. If you're someone that is interesting in being with someone else then it's going to happen I believe it because I used to feel like that too.
depression,f1q0cff,t3_dag7w9,1569691200.0,Nobody gets to say who is ugly or not. You're a human being just like everyone else. Don't let all the norms of this world ruin you. The only ugly is someone with an ugly heart. People will always judge. Keep that head up.
depression,f1pygw4,t3_dae7sl,1569690197.0,That was tough to read. I can't imagine how you felt your whole life. I've been stuck in depression too but it saddens me to hear how you have never been in a good place even when you tried and worked hard. Probably won't mean anything but if I wasn't piss broke we could meet up and vacation somewhere. It probably won't make life meaningful but damnit I'd make sure we would have a good time to remember.
depression,f1jivms,t3_d9ns4r,1569523746.0,Be strong. Hold on. I'm in the same boat. That's what I would tell you if we were on a sinking ship together and it seemed hopeless. I try to tell myself that at least.
runescape,f1j745f,t3_d9loa3,1569519588.0,It would! At least I agree. But it's not about the game being fun for us it's about how much money can be made. Apparently.
depression,f1j6qq1,t3_d9flid,1569519454.0,I agree. Worst feeling in the world.. not sure how much longer I'm gonna last either..But on the flip side..maybe we just gotta hold on a little longer.. something will change. It has to. I don't know you and I'm glad I'm not alone but if I did know you and you said you wanted to keep pushing through life..then hell I'd want to as well..
runescape,f1ercxk,t3_d8vt8k,1569428578.0,LOL

runescape,ew88phy,t3_cn6zt5,1565205560.0,Dude are you cheating? Omg like wtf..
2007scape,etusuoj,t3_cdezkj,1563219299.0,"Soo.. I don't remember how but it must have been a bug or glitch or something.  I was on the island and I went up the ladder of the crashed ship then went back down on the side of the ladder (possibly from having run on?) and got stuck at the bottom of the side of the ladder...I had no tele runes...(this was before home tele).  I saw ""Lol"" in yellow text above me. Some one was standing in the same spot stuck as well. They had be doing the same part of the quest and did what I did. But I think about how it was a miracle because they had runes and they said they would come back to drop runes for me."
