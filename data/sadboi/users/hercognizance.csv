1) Tyler and his brother recently lost their mother. 
2) There is an epidemic of proportions that we don‚Äôt know

Reasonable responses:
1) Not announcing a serious relationship that has been strongly supported and hoped for by BN/fan base/whoever right now. 
2) The Crew are ‚Äúquarantined‚Äù and full of extroverts. Serving up content that they can brainstorm and spend time on is a very ideal activity. People have already written about the plight of the extrovert in this time and it makes sense that this is somewhat helpful.
3)  They could be involved but see it as inappropriate timing. They have obviously addressed the elephant in the room.

The spill that happened with Hannah B on the road before her final rose ceremony was on an incline but it is not impossible to imagine when walking the inordinately long, sometimes mini golf like path to the proposal.

You have to look down, look back up and smile, hold your dress, have your heel sink into the ground, still smile wondering how they will deal with potentially being rejected and walking back with any pride left if their heel sinks in or they trip."
