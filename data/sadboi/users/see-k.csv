You could always go back to your first character afterwards if you really want to try the DLC straight away."

""You have mentioned that your concern is regarding outfits. We have a solution for you, we can help you remove those from your wardrobe so that you can purchase from the store again.

In order to assist you further, I would request you to please reply  to this ticket and confirm the name of the outfits you want to remove.""

RedDeadOnline,f1dud4p,t1_f1du5kr,1569399944.0,Yes they asked for the names of the outfits that are not working so they can remove them for re-purchase. Any other time I have raised this with them they have said it was not possible to delete but something must have changed.

RedDeadOnline,f04jk8l,t3_d3qy7s,1568388900.0,There is new white and black leather for the wraps on weapons. Also new varnishes.
RedDeadOnline,f04i1io,t1_f04fjlc,1568387922.0,"True but making a big push advertising how to get each role for free then it not actually working is a little crazy. I have outfits I got with ultimate edition that I cannot separated due to a glitch from day 1 that has been put under the "" we know about it and are looking in to a fix"" category. Silly things that aren't important but are a little annoying."
RedDeadOnline,f04b5tm,t3_d3pnjo,1568383750.0,Its quite a big bug to miss before launching the update. That along with the free roles advertised still charging makes you think they didn't test a lot of it before release.
