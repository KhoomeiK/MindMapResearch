Yes youre right religion right now is like HEY GOD/HIGHER POWER DIDNT WANT US TO DO THIS!!! while science is like this is part of nature and its normal and this is right, whilst both could he right, if a higher power didnt want us to explore space then why make the moon?Mars? look through a telescope üî≠?

That makes me belive that if there is a higher power it knows us by heart and has power within us, emotions, feelings, personalities, I try not to talk much on this cause I can get to be too much but thats what I have to say, society could crumble if we continue this way, if we barely make it through a global pandemic what makes people think we can put humans on mars??? my point being that we as society should in a way level up and become stronger, and its slowly happening and decreasing, the average human today is taller than the human from a century or two ago, the human of the next century could be way taller from living in space! who knows"
