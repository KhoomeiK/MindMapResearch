I'm a type two and it has actually reminded me of who I was before my depression spiriled. Each type has their strong points and their weak points. The goal is to not let those weak points control us and take over. Two are emotional balls of mushy love. But we tend to give other the kindness that we have neglected to give ourselves. This can lead to self loathing, self doubt and spiral into horrible depression. Now, I know that sounds awful, but here is how I have been able to look at it. Twos can become a bit egotistic because of how generous and kind they can be. The ""negative"" side of Twos is a good way to put us in check and keep us humble. If you can view it that way, I think it will help you in finding that perfect balance in who you are. 

Side note: I use the word ""negative"" VERY loosely. There are NO negative emotions. All emotions are just what they are, emotions. What we do in reaction to tho emotions it's what is good or bad. A feeling is just a feeling. Sometimes it's hard to find a different word to describe things tho. A feel that makes you feel bad is perceived as negative. Sorrow and anger aren't bad."

He gets crickets mostly, but we do have wax worms as well.

I'm a type 2! I've been struggling with handling me emotions for the past couple of years. Even ended up in intensive treatment. I have a tendency to isolate myself, which is an unhealthy way of dealing with it. But! Instead of isolating myself for hours at a time, I give myself a 10-minute time limit. It allows me to either distract myself with something like Sudoku or an adult coloring book, or a perfect amount of time to practice my grounding techniques and mindfulness meditation. Occasionally I will also try to do some worksheets from my DBT workbook, which is incredibly helpful. I would be happy to post the title of the workbook later on when I'm home if you are interested!

Lately I have started to contact my mom and talk to her when I'm feeling overwhelmed emotionally. I have also forced myself to not isolate and go do something that distracts me or something that's productive like cooking, cleaning, or some kind of outdoor activity or chore that takes my mind off of the issue or the emotion and gives me the time to cool off.

I'm married to a type 5, so he likes to be left alone and isn't very physical. I have had to learn that it doesn't mean he is rejecting or abandoning me. Those things are what to suffer from. But I have tried to speak to him in detail about how I'm feeling and the flow of my thought process. As a five, he doesn't exactly understand how 2s end up at certain conclusions. 5s rely heavily on details and information. being able to sit down with him and go through my thought process with him has really helped him understand how I'm feeling and where I come up with a lot of the overly emotional and even aggressive thoughts. That has been a saving grace for us since I have started to do that. I'm not perfect at it, but I definitely been trying and we have both seen the results of it."

I've actually help a few classes in my salon for clients that want to learn how to brush properly. I do charge for it and do a drawing for free admission and a drawing for a free one on one class. I do little packages on it too!   


Group Class

* $10 - Class
* $18 Class + a brush
* $25 Class, brush, brushing spray
* $35 class, brush, brushing pray, 2oz bottles of shampoo and dematt conditioner
* $45 class, burhs, spray, 12oz bottles of shampoo and dematt conditioner 
* $80 class, CC Brush, Hydra dematting/finishing spray, 2oz bottles of shampoo and dematt conditioner
* $110 class, CC Brush, Hydra dematting/finishing spray, 12oz bottles of shampoo and dematt conditioner

I had way more clients interested than I thought I would! I charge $20+ for each package for personal classes. The classes are an hour long. I usually have a client bring in a dog to use for teaching and that client gets the $35 bundle for free. I also get everyone to fill out a form that includes their email. I send everyone an email with links to great videos for brushing just in case! My clients absolutely love it, I get more dogs in with well maintained coats and of course I have that extra income!"

doggrooming,fkuz2hh,t3_fkcmgu,1584558832.0,"First off, I want to say that your didn't need a haircut. There's no reason for him to have any anything more than a paw trim and maybe a butt trim if he has problems with poop getting stuck. You really need to be more specific when going to a groomer. Telling someone ""I want a good trim"" can mean anything between just a face feet and fanny to a shave down. This groomer obviously thought that meant a shave to. If you're groomer doesn't ask specific questions about what you want, then you probably shouldn't go to them. I'm so annoying when my clients come in for the first time, but all of them walk out happy because I took the time to listen and get details they wouldn't have thought of without my questions.   


As for his coat, he should be fine. Usually coat damage is only due to an underlying medical condition. That's not always the case, but usually it is. If you're worried, give him a back every other week with a good conditioner that helps with coat and skin health.   


Now for the hair cut. That's just awful. I have no idea why the groomer wouldnt go back over those chop marks. I certainly would look somewhere else. Post in your local fb group and ask for recommendations. Check reviews; try not to hold bad reviews too high, read the owners replies to bad reviews and that usually says a lot about that person. Look at pictures of their work as well. Do NOT go to a groomer with low prices. You get what you pay for. Period. I've never seen a cheap groomer actually produce good grooms. I started my business on the higher end of pricing and have never had a problem getting clients since I do a good job and charge what I'm worth."

Influenster,ffarr7j,t1_ffapisy,1579742958.0,"I actually own three business, sweetie. But nice jab. You much have a pretty pathetic life to be happy thinking of someone cutting themselves. And you aren't that pretty hun. As for my husband, that's pretty low. That's genuinely a shitty thing to say to someone over a silly comment because you are so triggered. I honestly hope that you find a way to better yourself and not be so nasty."
depression,ffaos7a,t1_ffamsp5,1579740966.0,"I don't think you understand what I meant. It's only a trigger when someone uses it to make me feel better. I'm not sure if you meant for your comment to come off condescending, but it kinda did. :/ I actually love comedy when I'm in a healthy and happy mindset"
Cooking,ffan057,t3_esh9jv,1579739764.0,"I read a couple of comments an saw that you have been cooking your childhood foods. My recommendation is DONT! You may; without knowing it, be comparing those dishes to how your parents made them. When it doesn't measure up, your brain tells you it's a failure. 

I actually just went through an intensive treatment program for depression and I found out I LOVE to cook. I have been looking up recipes that I think my husband would like. I cook for him, not me. And my dishes are ones my parents never made when I was a kid. I have loved almost every single one I've made. It's really fun to make it by the recipe and then put my own spin on it next time. I like to get real feedback from my husband on what he thinks it might need or what he thinks would make it better. I've even started my own little home cookbook! I would be happy to share some of my recipes with you if you want to give them a go :)"
depression,ffamg5z,t1_ffal5vx,1579739386.0,"You're right, but we shouldn't assume that it would or would not. Comedy makes my depression MUCH worse. It can actually be a violent trigger for me. It would be best to tread lightly when it comes to things we think might help. Everyone is different."
Influenster,ffaluiv,t1_ff7m4xl,1579738979.0,Ohhhh this is going to be useful
shameless,ffalmj3,t1_ff6imfp,1579738826.0,"I like that this proves you harass people and then Snoop on what their comment and then talk shut about them and what they say. You're the only troll here. Keep digging that hole, baby."
NetflixBestOf,ffalfaf,t1_ffa5qgi,1579738684.0,And you're telling people to die. Wow. Hmmmm
AskReddit,ffalc4e,t1_ffacjkm,1579738621.0,That's incredible discriminatory. You know people can have mood and personality disorders? Seems like you have one. You must be uncomfortable all the time.
AskReddit,ffal7mg,t1_ffahssv,1579738534.0,And you say I'm harassing people. Lol look at you. Let's see how many more I can find. I'm sure it won't be hard :)
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ffakb77,t1_ff9mrb1,1579737859.0,"I'm glad I have triggered you so much you have to look into me. Because I'm sure by the few posts I've made you can ðŸ’¯ tell what kind of person I am. You know nothing about me. You're upset because you didn't get the response Your Majesty wanted. At least I'm not over here wish someone else to be in pain. You're just vindictive and cruel. The only thing that's pathetic hear is your attitude towards someone who literally did nothing to you. :)

Edit: I see your going to all of my posts and down voting them. Now THAT pathetic lol"
entitledparents,ffak2up,t1_ffajras,1579737694.0,"Lol I'm not. I'm being honest. And I'm actually being fairly nice about it considering the fact your acting like a child and speaking to me the way you are. You can handle the truth, so you're lashing out."
entitledparents,ffahuvk,t1_ffa47lu,1579736094.0,"You shouldn't be so triggered right now, sweetie. Your uncle made that mistake over and over and over and over again. And didn't care."
