BPD,fkcdlhq,t3_fhcrn3,1584050850.0,"I read that people with attachment issues often feel most attraction where they are uniquely valued, special.  I have always said that my love for someone is based on their love for me.  it's OK for it to flip a switch when someone says the things that guy did.  😊"
BPD,fkcdb8f,t1_fkbzw8t,1584050678.0,"I'm not sure what exactly the situation is, but I do know that being home with kids all day is very isolating unless you keep yourself and them busy.  

The relationship that taught me how to manage BPD tendencies was with someone who I trusted completely because of the nature of his character yet had his own life and buddies to spend time with.  before that my favorite person was a narcissist, and encouraged codependence, so this relationship didn't exactly give me the emotional stimulation that I was used to.  

It took friends, a lot of friends, to make up for the gap.  and a lot of self-awareness.  when I felt stupid and felt that he wasnt as in2 me, I would pick up the phone and call a friend instead.  if they didn't pick up, i'd call the next person.  usually one of them had a problem much worse than my imagined one and it changed my mood & how i Felt about myself to be helpful.  it also helped keep some of the crazy from my primary relationship.

The lesson that I learned with that is that it takes more than one person to love and depend on to have a healthy relationship with all people in your life.  BPD's have a lot of love to give, it's OK to spread that around to others in your life 😊"

I wasted a lot of time on someone who did that, who wanted a 'no strings' relationship.  Ironically, i realized he was NPD, and wanted me on the hook so he had constant supply.  Having me to make him happy acting enuf to attract someone else, make him look 'whole.'  

'No strings' only applied to him I guess.  

Not saying that ur friend is like this, but hanging out & sleeping w you is kinda what dating is.  Labels aside, he started something new without even telling u he was looking - u had to get told the embarrassing way.  You deserve better.

Years & years of breeding for a profitable industry makes most rescued greyhounds pretty emotionally balanced biologically overall.  Im often very proud when Izy calmly trots by a crazy, barking lab with its owner at the other end of its leash, yelling & pulling at it.  We're too cool for that.  :-P  

Greyhounds are no strangers to a crate of course.  

**If anything, they're generally a lot easier to neglect than a squirrelly, vocal small dog.**

It's up to us owners, the human doggo-parents, to treat them as family; companions, not possessions.  If I can possibly run home at lunch, I do.  I only do gym after letting her out at nite, too.  

You're smart to investigate, and if I were you, Id check out some greyhound playdates in ur area and ask your questions, contact GPA's fosters locally."

Its astounding how jdubs really do try to grab every possible topic and give their own, unquestionable, explanation.  Just to ensure u dont think on ur own.

Bottom line is:  There’s always a reason NOT to do something, but those moments when we’re low, alone, want to reach out, those are the times to remember why u keep trying to grow.  Explore everything that u think might be helpful.  Worst scenario, and it’s not your issue, hey, you learned something new.

We all can display ADHD’s range of symptoms in our own way.  But lets face it, we prolly must withstand a lot more failure & rejection (even imagined or assumed by not being normal)  than neurotypical ppl.

That being said, Im not rejection sensitive in a depressive way, I just figure ppl can F-off (defiant type) if they dont like it.  But, an ADHD friend of mine definitely has no perspective of rejection feelings, and it causes a lot of anxiety/giving up.

Keep looking for ways to disengage and detach emotionally from those situations that trigger ur rejection fear.  Walk thru it & u’ll learn that life goes on.  Black & white thinking pairs up with our fears & gives us a reason to be dramatic, because drama & negativity is stimulating, easy to focus on, even for ADHD.  Dont trust ur brain :-P"
