I know it may be difficult now, but if it permits within the next year, try to visit all of the schools you're seriously interested in. The school I ended up going to was toward the bottom of my list until I visited and fell in love with it. In fact, Columbia was one of the schools I was considering going to until I visited and really, really didn't like it. At that point, Columbia's prestige didn't matter; it simply didn't fit for me.

I'd also recommend talking to students from your prospective schools. Especially students studying what you intend to study, if you can. Dig around the school websites and see what resources they have related to your interests, too.

If you have the credentials to get into a top school, I'm sure you'll be successful anywhere. Good luck with your decision!"

psychologystudents,fn59ub4,t3_fzk4l0,1586659429.0,"What you do at your school matters more than where you go. With that being said, you can go anywhere -- just make sure you're on top of everything.

If you feel you can handle a top school like UChicago or Harvard, go for it. If you feel like you can't, then follow that intuition. Keep in mind that a lot of very smart pre-med students who go to top schools end up not going to med school in the end because of the competitive nature of their schools. Nonetheless, if you feel that you have it in you to be successful at a top school, I say go for it.

I will tell you, though, that prestige is not worth financial risk. I wouldn't advise choosing an expensive private school over a state school if you truly can't afford it. If you can, that's a different story. But you most definitely can be just as or even more successful out of a state school than a private school that would require you to take out loans."

The best approach to this is to try different amounts of time until you find what works for you. Find a good time to go to bed consistently every night, try using an app like Sleep Cycle that will wake you gradually, and see what works for you! Good luck.
