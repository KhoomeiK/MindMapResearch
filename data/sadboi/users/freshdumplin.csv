UnresolvedMysteries,fhunuzw,t1_fhrw93t,1581888411.0,"Give them a phone (assuming they have one) and make sure they update u when they go places. I think it is good to educate them about sex trafficking and dangers like this if you feel they are ready. Tell them tips like how to bust out a tail light, how to break off zipties (good vids on youtube), warning signs and etc.. tell them it is always better to be cautious than not and to always call 911 before you in emergencies. Warn them of how sometimes adults may ask for help/act disabled/etc.. to get sympathy for young girls to help them and end up taking them. Also not a bad idea to get them a little safety alarm thing some women have if you want them to have a safety item but not pepper spray. Im 18 and these tips have always kept me safe.
