skin,fok1zes,t3_g7stfj,1587833890.0,I had similar scarring and began using trilogy rosehip oil every night.  I noticed a difference within 2 weeks and completely faded my scars in about 2-3 months.  Highly recommend
skin,fo5b3nw,t1_fo561w7,1587521467.0,"Good!! If it ends up spreading, definitely see a doctor about it because if it is contact dermatitis, it can be intense if left untreated."
skin,fo55pnn,t3_g5n5nq,1587518077.0,My boyfriend had something that started out like this called contact dermatitis.  He’s ended up spreading and turned purple/ bruised looking.  He had intense itching.  Doctors misdiagnosed at first as shingles but dermatologist decided it was contact dermatitis after a biopsy and put him on a steroid that cleared it up quickly.  His blistered and scabbed as well.  This reminds me of how it looked.

SkincareAddiction,evhxyv6,t1_evhwb6w,1564533924.0,"I’m starting Nizoral today in hopes that it’s a fungal acne and this will help, active ingredient is Ketoconazole 1%.  I’m also masking with De La Cruz 10% sulfur ointment.  I tried switching to a super gentle routine (cetaphil cleanser and moisturizer) before starting Nizoral today and it seemed to make it worse.  

I was also using Mario Badescu drying lotion with Salicylic acid but it didn’t seem to help."
