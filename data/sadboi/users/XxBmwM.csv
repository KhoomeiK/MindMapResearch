adderall,fq6c1ei,t3_ggx0vj,1589128611.0,Could be a result of overstimulation. Have you tried taking a lower dose or even taking a tolerance break?

benzodiazepines,fpnxsy2,t3_gedxda,1588774715.0,Lmfao these posts are honestly getting me through these depressing times.
benzodiazepines,fpm3dkw,t1_fpm252u,1588724736.0,Kpins are my weakness for sure. I heard Lyrica gives a good buzz as well.

adderall,fpm2ihx,t3_ge515a,1588724235.0,"Thatâ€™s how I get when I drink too much coffee; just feel like napping for a little. Adderall definitely calms me down, but makes sleeping almost impossible for me."

benzodiazepines,fplyp2w,t3_ge1ivv,1588722049.0,Haha Iâ€™m weak.
benzodiazepines,fplymtn,t1_fply7t2,1588722012.0,I can definitely relate to that.
adderall,fplp5tf,t1_fplo6hu,1588716824.0,It could be a result of all of the above lol. Thank you for the suggestions. Adderall definitely interfering with my sleep for sure.
adderall,fployty,t1_fplnuld,1588716718.0,Lol Adderall works better at controlling my symptoms for sure.
adderall,fplm7jx,t3_ge0w5m,1588715243.0,Porn; the sad truth.
adderall,fplkuni,t1_fpljopd,1588714528.0,I appreciate you fam. I probably could drink more water honestly. It just sucks having so many more side effects on Adderall than Vyvanse; given that it works so much better.
AMG,fplkf4b,t3_ge1agj,1588714305.0,I am so jealous of you. Amazing car.
mercedes_benz,fplkbnl,t1_fpkx3ij,1588714254.0,I had a 2012 C350 Coupe before I totaled it. Great car for the money.
adderall,fplj9h5,t1_fplj3lf,1588713704.0,Idk if it is; I drink 2-3 liters of water a day. Good suggestion though.

benzorecovery,fpgqqs9,t3_gddp4u,1588607792.0,"If you have a doctor, Gabapentin helps a lot, but again, thatâ€™s substituting one addiction to another."
benzorecovery,fpgqk52,t3_gddw9y,1588607698.0,Thatâ€™s a slow taper; you should be fine. Wish I had your level of patience. Good luck.
adderall,fpglrb6,t1_fpgj9wp,1588605165.0,Props for the self control.
WRX,fpgh08b,t3_gdb58s,1588602523.0,So clean; thanks for sharing.
adderall,fpewf70,t1_fpev7xr,1588556412.0,"Ritalin is only an DRI, and Adderall is both a DRI and a Dopamine agonist; thus, Adderall is more effective for ADHD symptoms."
adderall,fpesow9,t1_fpes3gk,1588554106.0,"Yeah, definitely a good idea. Thank you amigo."
adderall,fpeound,t1_fpen2zi,1588551790.0,"Yeah Iâ€™ve been diagnosed, and yeah I love Clonidine. They gave that to me in rehab."

adderall,fpenhjr,t1_fpek020,1588550970.0,Youâ€™re good. Yeah pretty typical dosage tbh
adderall,fpen5p8,t1_fpel5pb,1588550784.0,Right? Like what other options are left for us? Lol
adderall,fpeiy7h,t1_fpeccmj,1588548449.0,Lmfao; the truth though.

adderall,fpeb04r,t1_fpeasoi,1588543918.0,"Thank you; I didnâ€™t know this. I consider myself a poly addict. I just have an addictive personality in general. However, I never abuse my prescribed medications; I always try to increase my dosage though. I always like to feel different after feeling the same for a while, if that makes any sense."
adderall,fpeai6r,t1_fpe91pb,1588543631.0,Well said. Thank you very much for sharing.
adderall,fpe8i24,t1_fpe8biz,1588542472.0,"Consider yourself lucky. Antipsychotics no longer make me sleepy. I used to pass out on Seroquel, now I can take it during the day, and not feel sleepy."
adderall,fpe7xvy,t1_fpe7tco,1588542152.0,"70 mg of Vyvanse; max dosage.
Also on Lexapro 20 mg, Zyprexa 20 mg to counteract the side effects. Itâ€™s ridiculous."
bipolar,fpe4krc,t1_fpde1tb,1588540220.0,"Have you ever tried going off of them, or lowered your dose? Did you have withdrawal symptoms? Do they make you feel hazy, unable to concentrate?"
adderall,fpe4f6d,t1_fpe45eo,1588540132.0,"I feel like I have to as well. Iâ€™m on so many meds now to counteract the side effects of Adderall/Vyvanse; itâ€™s just not right. Iâ€™m not the person I used to be. I feel like I would be in a better place right now, if it wasnâ€™t for amps. Itâ€™s just hard not thinking about them when off of them. Once an addict always an addict I guess."
adderall,fpe3tsz,t3_gcxpmz,1588539798.0,"You will come running back to Adderall. Itâ€™s a superior drug in terms of handling ADHD symptoms. Ritalin will have less side effects though, in theory."

bipolar,fp77bgd,t1_fp76wfw,1588365365.0,Good stuff. Are you replacing it with something else?
bipolar,fp75017,t1_fp74o2o,1588364158.0,I believe so; Iâ€™m on the highest dosage. Lexapro definitely a contributing factor as well.
bipolar,fp74vkm,t3_gbp6lk,1588364093.0,Zyprexa*
