I’m confused on how many calories I should eat per day. I would like to lose ~2 pounds per week.
I do either 30 minutes of light cardio mixed with strength training and then a three mile walk or I run one minute/walk one minute for 2ish miles. 

My BMR is 1609. Since I exercise 5 times per week, I have been told that I should eat 2,213-2,494 cal per day minus a 1000 cal deficit to lose two pounds per week, which totals to 1200-1400 cals per day. 

Is this enough/not enough/too much? Any recommendations on cals per day is welcome. 

I also don’t know if my exercise counts as light or moderate exercise if anyone could help with that too."
