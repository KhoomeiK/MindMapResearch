SocialMediaMarketing,fqx2kco,t3_glfj0v,1589724310.0,"In the short-term, it’s probably easiest to solidify a weekly rate, which averages in all the things you are doing.  Let’s say you do some posts (medium skill), answer some inquiries (low skill), and edit some videos (high skill); average all that into a weekly rate, rather than trying to assess the value or skill needed to do each thing.

I don’t think asking for a raise right now during the pandemic will go too far.   But, getting what you’re supposed to be paid for doing the work you’re currently doing should be communicated.  Your job shifted, the landscape shifted.  If you’re doing a lot “more” you should be compensated for your time.

Analytics and tracking is the key to actually going in and getting a raise.  If you don’t have concrete examples of the conversions you’re making happen, it’ll be hard to ask for a raise.

Consider it like this:  the past 18 months, the company invested in you by paying for you to learn some new things in order to do them for the company.  Now that you know how to do these things, give back to the company by doing these skills you learned on the company dollar at the rate you were working at before.   If you spent your own time learning how to do these things, and now you can provide them to the company, it’s up to you to decide if what you’re doing is really worth more money.  

It sounds like overall, you’re doing more work. And you should get paid for the work you do.  Paid for the time.   But my suggestion is to figure out the weekly rate of all social media marketing efforts that you have to do."

Viewing the birds eye view essence of marketing is not really being in a position to know how to be a good marketer.   You know what you know and know what you don’t know. But you don’t know what you don’t know.  Your partner doesn’t know what he doesn’t know about marketing, so his efforts will always be hindered, unless he’s going to delve into learning about marketing.

I’m smart. I can look at a house and know how it’s built.   But I really don’t know what actually goes in to building a house, and the only way I could ever actually do it right would be to start learning how.   

So, if your partner wants to do it himself, he’s going to be spending the time learning how to become a marketer for the biz... which is great, but it also pulls away from what the partner actually specializes in in the company.

You and your partner may be looking for a marketing consultant; someone that you check in with for 30 minutes once or twice a week. This person can glance over the marketing work and give constructive criticism and ideas.  In this situation, you and your partner are handling your own marketing work, and you have a specialist’s eyes and brain guiding your work; making sure you’re not missing anything.

The other route is to hire a marketer to do the work.    Sure, there are shitty marketers and snake oil salesmen.  There are people that build shitty houses.  Work with a marketer who is honest and is clear about what they will provide, the analytics to show their ideas are working, and updates on pivots; dropping away what didn’t work."

AskMarketing,foq2etd,t3_g8x9sn,1587980509.0,"You’re probably both correct, but you’re both speaking in the spectrum of potential.

Good marketing works, when it’s done correctly, and this has been proven.

Bad marketing is a scam, when there are promises without effective execution or success.

What is not a scam: continually using a marketing budget to explore potential, checking results, pivoting to what works while dropping what doesn’t work.

What is a scam: a marketer that promises leads, sales, and conversions; then continually does the same thing, achieves the same results, and then talks about the nebulous marketing world is hard to grasp.

The act of you posting an ad is worth what it costs to run the ad and your time to set it up with no skill in marketing.   Hiring a (legit, real) marketer means you’re paying an expert to promote/advertise.

I think your partner is very naive to glance at a realm and say “it’s all just X, Y, and Z” because if it was just that then your partner would have a marketing avenue that works already.  On the other side of the spectrum, you shouldn’t throw money at a marketing agency just because they are experts at presenting and selling marketing packages.

PS: I’m not a scam because I do the work first then receive payment only if they would like to continue.  Any freelancer that shows you the effectiveness first, then asks for payment, it’s impossible to be a scam."

AskMarketing,fo2mtur,t1_fo1o82a,1587468186.0,"What I think would be most desirable to some HR hiring person in a corporate marketing agency would be that the candidate fits well with the open position, rather than a candidate that has the best degree and biggest education.

And there are plenty of marketing positions that also call for coding skills.     But there’s never a position that requires a double major.   I personally think that if you announce that you know python in a job interview, that’s going to cement you having to do that work if hired.

An example from my own experience:   I went in for an interview to work in the marketing department of a video streaming company.  On my resume I had written graphic design as my list of skills.  At the interview, I discover they’ll want me to make a lot of graphics for marketing promos.    I have the skills they were looking for, however, I want to focus on marketing strategy, and not creating ad-copy.      So, in that company, they were looking for a graphic designer that also has a marketing background.  I’m a marketer that has previously learned graphic design, but I don’t want to do graphic design daily as my main task.

Another similar experience was a company that wanted to hire a marketer with Wordpress and SEO experience.  Again, webdev is not something I want to work on daily, but knowing the basics of Wordpress and how SEO works has helped me immensely.

So, 2 majors, or 1, if it’s a major you’re not passionate about, then you won’t want to do it as work.  In every job interview I’ve had, education is usually one-two questions, they don’t really care the name or label of the major. They just care about you being able to do what you say you can do."

Coding is a different beast than marketing, but that's exactly what my career is;  I build tools to use for marketing strategies.

Having said all of this, the degree is to impress a large corporate agency.  If you're heading in that direction, research what ad agencies are looking for and aim for that degree.  If you're looking to work in-house as the marketing director for a company, then your degree won't matter.  Proving your worth will be what matters.

I scrape together a list of their followers and fans.  This doesn’t necessarily give me an analysis, but it does give me a lot of their customers/clients contact info.   It also reveals what influencers the competitor may be working with."

A bio is personal, so if you can pick out certain jokes and add it to your bio, like spicing up your meal with pepper, then it still will feel like it came from you if you picked the jokes.

If you wanna, post your bio; what you have so far."

They may offer deals or a freebie, nothing that'll be other than saving a few bucks.

There used to be a Cannabis Liberation Fest, but that stopped a few years ago.

I think cause of Coronavirus, coffeeshops will want you to get your stuff and go."

Personally I think you should get an LED and grow tent.  Step up from space bucket.   

Legally you are allowed to grow up to 5 plants.   Growing 4 in one tent is manageable and affordable.

CannabisGrowers,fnpr9h2,t3_g38a07,1587150537.0,"Good question.   I can send you my product recommendations later if you’re interested, in the meantime, here’s what you can do:

Get an autoflower strain that is mold and mildew resistant.  If you do this you can skip the dehumidifier.   You’ll end up having to get a dehumidifier because you won’t want to stick with mildew resistant strains.  I spent $130 on my dehumidifier.   Unfortunately those small box mini dehumidifiers do nothing other than cost electricity.

If you don’t care about trying to hide the smell you can skip the carbon exhaust filter and the motor fan.  I’d recommend the power motor fan to exhaust the air up and out, but also, you can leave a corner of the tent open, and some holes open, and a fan blowing will be fine.

You can skip the tent, but I highly recommend the tent.  If you do 4’x5’x6’ tent that’s enough space for four autoflowers.

You can skip nutes and calmag but then you have to make it yourself.  Teas, molasses, lots of research and reading.  I recommend getting advanced nutrients trio.

I’ll send you exact links lemme know"
