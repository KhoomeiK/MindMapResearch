curlyhair,fh91mni,t1_fh8wqv5,1581371832.0,"Blimey. Wouldn’t say you look 18, but that’s not a bad thing at all. You have a very ‘grown-up’ look (whatever that means). I’m 27 and get told I have a baby-face and could pass for 20 or younger, which drives me mad.  Women are ‘supposed’ to look younger and men are ‘supposed’ to look older. It’s all bollocks, you’re a beautiful person and your curls are bob on. Keep it up."

Anxiety,f8wihw5,t3_e2n4yi,1574891569.0,"Why do you think you do it?  Is this instant reactions to questions where you lie to divert people's attention from what's going on with you mentally (if so, this is one of the most common symptoms of anxiety and is okay)?  Or do you tend to construct bigger lies that build up?

I can tell you I've done both of these.  I used to construct big lies because I felt I was boring (I used to tell myself I was the most average person in the world, so completely in the middle of everything that there was nothing of note about me).  This stopped a few years a go for me because I started doing interesting things.  I didn't even have to go hugely out of my comfort zone, everything was with my best mate and it'd be little things like seeing new bands, visiting lands end, climbing snowdonia, taking up snowboarding and sim-racing.  I found that having more experiences under my belt meant I was less likely to make up 'interesting' stories to feel valuable.  The mad thing is, I don't even tell people about the stuff I have done, so they probably still think I'm boring, but at least I'm genuine now.

The important thing is not to feel ashamed of yourself.  It's so hard to believe that there's something causing you to fabricate truths, but that is really what is happening.  People close to you may not understand this at first either, but if they're good people they'll take an apology and an explanation and should then support you through it."
Anxiety,f8whhkv,t3_e2ilkx,1574890912.0,"I completely feel you here.  When I hit the bottom of the curve I'm completely depressed and often I'll sit down staring ahead just running through all the evil in my head wanting so much to cry and release it, but it just won't come out.  I can feel myself welling up sometimes, but no tears come.  It's tough because it feels like you're not able to get rid of the negativity.

My advice, when you're out of your dip (which will happen if you keep looking forward) talk to your confidant(s) about how you felt.  Try to remember everything about what's going on now, so you can hash it out when you're feeling more positive, heck you may even have a cry when talking it through, which would be fantastic!"

It takes me a full day to fight back my anxiety and depression to a point where I feel like I can finally breath and smile. Then I have to sleep, which means I’m going to be waking up in a few hours, depressed again and afraid of the world.  Because of this I’ll stay up until 2-3 in the morning just watching films and listening to music because it’s the only part of the day I can get some enjoyment out of."

AskReddit,eqasxfx,t3_bxzc8p,1559939304.0,"This is tough. The things that often spring to mind are instantly marred by a darker side. For example, the sense of belonging/community, however this only comes through vast and specific discrimination. Also, the ability to make people believe things will always get better, however this is sold on a lie that a deity will improve you life if you just ask nicely, or donate. 

The only truly admirable thing, in my opinion, is the origin of religion. It’s scientific origin; it being an early example of a fast evolving civilisation starting to ask questions about our world. Without this, we wouldn’t have developed the sciences."
