insaneparents,ffyu4m9,t1_ffytzlx,1580355190.0,Friends as I left the house after my stepdad had grabbed my throat and pinned me against a wall. I called the cops and somehow my family twisted the story to make me the aggressor and I was charged with domestic violence but my family has moved on and into charges were dropped.
insaneparents,ffytuaz,t1_ffyts2a,1580354984.0,I’m unsure who owns the house but I believe it’s my stepdad.
insaneparents,ffytlj1,t1_ffytba8,1580354811.0,They originally owned moved out and it became my stepdads and his sisters and then my mom married him his sister left and they came back to watch my toddler sisters and help pay bills.
insaneparents,ffyth44,t1_ffyt827,1580354724.0,I called the cops on my stepdad not him and they twisted it into me being arrested instead but it’s over and everyone has moved past it.  So idk why he’s so mad and it’s horrible.
insaneparents,ffytc6m,t1_ffyt7pf,1580354629.0,My mom is very mad and my stepdad the son of the man who wrote the letter wasn’t really present when I told them. And they struggle with ignoring them and making it their house not him because they help pay bills.
insaneparents,ffyt2po,t1_ffyt16d,1580354444.0,Yeah although if I did that I’d probably be beat severely.
insaneparents,ffyszfz,t1_ffyrqyp,1580354381.0,I guess yeah it’s stupid
insaneparents,ffysw3t,t1_ffyrurm,1580354315.0,I’m 17 and it’s both of their houses they help pay bills as we are right in funds all the time and it’s crazy.
insaneparents,ffyssv7,t1_ffyrt0m,1580354254.0,He helps pay bills so he’s kept around alongside his wife and they help watch my toddler sisters so they are needed.
DnD,ffnj1yy,t1_ffniqd8,1580066571.0,Well In the one shot there’s a room near the jar room with dismembered bodies that had the souls taken out so I’d doubt it was given up willingly. And the end of the one shot was the team killing the necromancer so while a black spirit jumped into the sky the necromancer is dead so maybe the spirit wants to kill the black spirit or something?
DnD,ffnif9s,t1_ffni0u0,1580066342.0,Well I need to figure out who was in it because the one shot didn’t give much info on the souls. A necromancer was the one who removed and jarred the souls.
DnD,ffnfj4p,t1_ffnf9ox,1580065323.0,Of course now to figure out what the souls personality is should it be the opposite of the character to be kind of annoying or should it be something else any ideas?
DnD,ffnea8v,t1_ffndmhm,1580064817.0,Idk if he gets an exorcism then he might be able to remove I’d think but if he decides to keep it and make it a character attribute would that work? Like for example he’s out on an adventure and a thunderstorm starts up prompting the soul to take over. He loses control and the souls attributes are what becomes the new character.
DnD,ffnd5gc,t1_ffncym2,1580064501.0,Ok so that solves how to make it work but how would the character change do they become a new character they can make or something they can’t control?

raisedbynarcissists,fdfzb2z,t1_fdfz5na,1578374514.0,Yeah he did it first too and before I left I was told by my mom that he said I punched first. This could be why it was turned on me. Why would I punch a 40 year old brick wall of a man I’m not sure but according to them I did.
raisedbynarcissists,fdfz56g,t1_fdfyn5p,1578374363.0,I have no idea I wasn’t told what they said to the police so I won’t know. They might’ve taken my yelling as abuse or something. I know I wasn’t a good person in this but I don’t know how exactly I was the aggressor.
raisedbynarcissists,fdcaeaz,t1_fdc9cm6,1578270291.0,Ok it’s stupid but I’ll be fine
raisedbynarcissists,fdc9k8u,t1_fdc9cm6,1578269796.0,Ok it’s stupid but I’ll be fine
raisedbynarcissists,fdc8d6n,t1_fdc7xfn,1578269094.0,I left because of a story I have it on a post if you want to read it look at some of my recent posts. But I was arrested today because apparantly I was the aggresor and was the domestic abuser I am on my way back home after my family bailed me out.

insaneparents,fb5214x,t1_fb4wuj0,1576519498.0,Ok boomer
insaneparents,fb452cr,t1_fb3mmin,1576501660.0,I don’t want to give in though it feels like I’ve lost. And I have told my mom that she hurts me and she’s like well you hurt me too and I guess that’s enough to be a child idk. My therapist told me to just say I’m sorry when we get in fights but it’s really hard in practice when you are swelling up with emotions.
insaneparents,fb44vtg,t1_fb3qga0,1576501536.0,Honestly wouldn’t be surprised she’s been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and uses them as excuses to be lazy stay in her room away from people. Idk also my stepdad is very suicidal and being raised by people who don’t believe depression is real and therapy is a scam will cause one to not care. He told me that suicidal thoughts is a normal weekly occurrence and everyone gets them.
insaneparents,fb3mdiv,t1_fb3ma1h,1576478448.0,No we live in the country and the closest town is about 20 minutes away in car. And Yeah that’s my goal however it’s real hard because of where we live. And Idk if they want to control me so much as it’s pure laziness and apathy.
insaneparents,fb3m696,t1_fb3m3tq,1576478214.0,Idk if I’m gonna be able to get it my test is tomorrow and my mom said she wasn’t gonna take me because of a fight earlier. So idk but hopefully soon.
insaneparents,fb3immn,t1_fb3igzc,1576474389.0,Ahh hopefully you are doing well with that. I as an anxious worrisome teenager who over thinks everything is afraid of the same thing. I’m in high school right now and my stepdad and mom had children a few years ago and all I can think is how sad their life will be and how I’ll most likely jump out of it as soon as I can which sucks because I love them.
insaneparents,fb3ii9n,t1_fb3ifp6,1576474268.0,I know I’m still in high school so it sucks I can’t do much for another year and a half. I’m maybe possibly getting my license soon so that will help.
insaneparents,fb3f79o,t1_fb3f2g1,1576471426.0,Thanks I’m so beyond annoyed with my family at this point she’ll text me to text other people for her and she’s in her room all day texting other people to get her water or to get her food and acts like a child as stated in my other comment.
insaneparents,fb3dg4f,t1_fb3czxl,1576470141.0,Yeah later this day we go into a fight about my driving and she gets out of the car goes to a store texts my stepdad who I’m with he doesn’t see it texts me to tell him to look at his texts and we have to go pick her up to drive back home and after she gets in the car resumes arguing with me says she’s not arguing just making statements and says that’s how it works because she the mom she’s the ruler and what she says goes and I’m like that’s not how this works and on our drive home after I’m reasonably mad road rage or emotional driving starts becoming a bit prevalent and when asked why I’m driving all wacky I respond with idk maybe it’s because you make me mad and want to kill myself and I get no reaction just silence. Anyways sorry with the bad grammar and long sentence I’m in a mood and upset and idk.
teenagers,fawgcle,t3_eao961,1576370797.0,My team is soooo bad we enjoy doing robotics but always are super far behind and do really bad at competitions but congrats

Christianity,f6r8pzt,t1_f6r8n0p,1573096596.0,Thank you and I’m in therapy but my living situation doesn’t let me go to it regularly or at least often enough for it to be truly beneficial.
Christianity,f6r7ta5,t1_f6r7f4a,1573095913.0,Got it thanks for the help idk if I’ll have an “eye-opening” experience because I tend to be logical about things and idk spiritual ideas are just so different? I guess I have a hard time latching onto them and if I have an experience like that cool I just know that I hate my life and I hurt the people around me and god seems to help. One of my friends to moderate practitioner is in love with god and she talks about how god has opened her eyes and taught her to see the good in everyone. I have a chronic case of pessimism and I really hate seeing the world in such dull colors.
Christianity,f6r7h4f,t1_f6r7e2j,1573095667.0,That’s an idea I have and I’ll try to do so I just struggle reading anything sorry.
Christianity,f6r7a1k,t1_f6r73kv,1573095521.0,I know I’m not saying I want to go from no practice to extreme practice. Maybe just none to educate myself and then move into semi practice or occasionally accompanying my friends to church to learn more about it.  I get your point and don’t want to dive straight in I just want to explore this world and see if it has anything to offer me.
Christianity,f6r6zuf,t1_f6r6lu3,1573095309.0,Our universe is definitely not an accident I know that. It’s origins are still a mess to me whether it’s God’s creation or the Big Bang idk. Our world is in such a tight balance of powers that if any constant were to increase or decrease everything would cease to exist. I’ve read a book called the cosmic landscape and this is the main idea of it. Not god vs Big Bang but how our universe exists and it goes on about multiple parallel universes. It’s interesting and neat to think about and this is why I have trouble with religion because cynically or as the devils advocate I would disagree because that’s how I am but in all reality I have no clue how or why we are here but we are and it scares me.
Christianity,f6r6fmq,t1_f6r69n0,1573094895.0,I’m not scared of hell or anything I know it’s a core concept of religion but I’m unsure if there is an afterlife at all. That’s the skeptic in me and the scientist so I have no clue I’m still young and dumb after all.
Christianity,f6r6bru,t3_dsr0lh,1573094817.0,I’m in therapy but do to my living situation I’m not always able to go but it does help a lot thanks for the consideration though. And yeah like I said in the post I’m in APeuro in high school and we are talking about the scientific revolution currently and have gotten passed the Protestant reformation and I’ve learned that many if not all of the original scientists and philosophers I’ve looked up to in my life were in fact very Christian. My teacher emphasizes this idea and that the scientists like Newton were trying to prove how amazing god was and how truly magnificent his creation is. And I’m possibly considering a career in science or history now because of my teacher. And yeah thanks for the advice sorry I sort of rambled on I tend to do that.
insaneparents,f6ofojk,t3_ds1ybm,1573016242.0,This sucks my mom is the same way I’m sorry man.
insaneparents,f6ivbgl,t3_dr9gbq,1572884932.0,This happens to me too it’s soooo dumb and my whole family have started using it as joke as whenever anything mildly wrong happens they all say welp it’s my fault like it always is.
narcissisticparents,f6d4z2e,t1_f6cjrbi,1572791365.0,That really sucks man I haven’t and won’t be kicked out because I’m their slave really. I help watch my baby sisters for I have to grab things for them because they are too lazy to grab them themselves. When I get my license I’m sure I’ll be doing errands for them I mean I already kind of do as sometimes they’ll drive me to like Walmart and tell me to go get some stuff for them while they sit in the car. I have to help carry wood for our furnace and they never give me a break if I have a really bad day they expect me to keep going or if I’m like about to pass out they scream at me that I’m lazy and useless and punish me. A lot of seems to stem from my stepdads upbringing of being a man dismissing all emotions and desires to get the job done there and now and it sucks. My stepdads parents live with us and they say that depression and anxiety disorders aren’t real and therapists are a scam because you just have to get over it you big baby.
insaneparents,f62xs6g,t3_dqb9m6,1572668636.0,My mom doesn’t scream at me if I say ANYTHING however she does get real mad when I mention she’s driving while on her phone while that’s illegal where I live and her hand isn’t even on the wheel and rather she’s driving with her knee.

apphysics,f1byn5p,t1_f1betvh,1569345928.0,The reason we are doing electrical fields first is because ap 2 is in a dual class with E and M we started with electrical fields so that we get it done now as it’s similar stuff apparently. My teacher isn’t the best obviously.
narcissisticparents,f04rxo9,t1_f04q47p,1568394252.0,Idk if it’s really a parent problem or just teen angst. I have no family around where I live also. My current plan is to move into a friends house or something when I turn 18 my senior year. I really like my school and it’s the first time I’ve been at a school for some time. I’ve made great friends and don’t want to lose them. My dad idk if he’s dangerous per say my stepmom is just someone I disagree with a lot and we get in many fights.
narcissisticparents,f02a21g,t1_f022iho,1568326513.0,I’ve talked to friends and I’m afraid to talk to counselors since they have to report it and I’d rather stay at this school then live with my dad who isn’t much better.
AskReddit,ezx9ter,t3_d2qug1,1568235308.0,I don’t know what happened to him but a kid in my 4th grade class seriously believed he and his family were the hulk. Idk why or how but he was a friend of mine and I tried to get the truth out of him a number of times but he seriously thought he was the hulk. Which was funny since he was a cute little fat chubby boy and idk. He also loves Godzilla and all those big monsters he was a great artist and wouldn’t be surprised if he was drawing comics now.
Swimming,ey5xrb2,t3_cvr9s8,1566842784.0,A lot of what I’ve been doing is stuff I found online and on here. I’m new to and I am joining my schools swim team this year. I’ve never been very sporty and when I hit 200 lbs I realized I had gone too far. Just use YouTube or find people in your community that can help. Have fun with it and keep going. That’s what I have to keep in mind at least.
AskMen,ey3z161,t3_cv7uec,1566777480.0,First real group of friends I had was a group of girls and it was freshman year of high school. I had a crush on one of them for awhile and she had one on me after a few months of the group hanging out we ended up dating in January. Sadly only a month and a half later she broke up with me. She was sick the week prior and had stopped talking to me and that lack of communication became a big issue she had seasonal depression too and I was far to clingy as she was my first girlfriend. The break up was hard for me as I ended up losing my entire group of friends and became very depressed afterward. She ended up dating another guy who hung out with them after they dropped me only 3 weeks after our breakup. That stung a lot later that year when sophomore year began we made up and are now acquaintances at best or person I know at worst. It sucks not having a group that you are so close too and I struggle with comparing my friends to them. They were truly great friends and yet they abandoned me all but one.

Swimming,ewtz63u,t3_cpztcs,1565758347.0,Dude you are me yes do it. I Iiterally posted the same thing a few months ago and after going to open swim getting to know some of the techniques I am hyped to join my schools swim team. I’m gonna be a junior which sucks since I missed out on two years already but you won’t. Go for it have fun and it will be greatI’m sure. And if you ever want to talk about the trials and tribulations of being new to swim and what not I’m here and we can fight it together. :)

boardgames,ewkeqc0,t1_ewkeh9e,1565482488.0,"Thanks once again I have a game tomorrow and the day after. Do you have any advice on being flexible with plans and strategies because I have done lots of research and know what works but I tend to either miss the mark or focus too
Much on one part of my plans. How do I work around this."
boardgames,ewiu6c9,t1_ewhzq8u,1565456791.0,This is really good advice thanks. I haven’t seen this anywhere else. In my games of rising sun though mind games are semi necessary to do anything during the war phase or at least knowing what another person wants and stopping them from knowing what I want.
boardgames,ew7t2ao,t1_ew71zcu,1565196770.0,I’m really bad with money making and ronin making in this game. I enjoy the three I have played so far being turtle fox and dragonfly and want to win with one of them bonsai is cool too though. They seem to be a sort of underdog.
boardgames,ew7sjzs,t1_ew6zhnm,1565196570.0,I was talking to a friend who is the one who wins a ton and he said I only focus on short term wins and l let my emotions control me other then the emotions how do I have a long term plan for the game and how do I stay flexible when it goes wrong.
boardgames,ew626gh,t1_ew61zha,1565151553.0,I’ve read this and planned on doing one of them I know one person wants to be sun when we play next and so with that virtue I enjoy the big force strategy as I have a weird love for monsters. I am really bad at making money and ronin though so I tend to avoid the ronin strategy and when war comes around I’m beaten due to my lack of funds . Any input on that.
SombraMains,evm02ie,t1_eulpilw,1564601459.0,Yes same I love it soooooooo much.
