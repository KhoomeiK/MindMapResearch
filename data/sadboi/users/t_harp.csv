mentalhealth,fdcvuym,t3_eknl1f,1578285799.0,Please be honest. Get the help you need and worry about the rest later. I’ve done a few internships in teen psych wards and you can really get a lot out of it if you want too. Be present and participate if you can. Start journaling. I’m sorry you are having these feelings but I hope being honest helps you learn coping strategies and get the treatment you need.
mentalhealth,fa9bt4i,t3_e80bx1,1575868097.0,Don’t compare yourself to anyone. Everyone is on their own journey and you need to focus on yourself. I’m proud of you for getting the help you need. Not everyone can do that. Know you are safe and will be feeling better soon <3
askwomenadvice,fa9983r,t1_fa98dp5,1575865843.0,Ask what you can do to help her get in the mood. And give options so it’s more of a discussion and not just answered with she can’t get into it.
askwomenadvice,fa92uza,t3_e83lpt,1575861006.0,You need to figure out what turns her on and gets her off. Does she masturbate? Watch porn? Is sex mostly centered around you? Do you guys do a lot of foreplay? Sometimes just going back to making out and touching can really put a woman in the mood. You guys need to communicate and see how you can make your romantic time more enjoyable for her. Oily massages? Chocolate sauce to lick off each other? Buy some new lingerie? All ideas but you need to communicate first.
Marriage,f8aep1b,t3_dzk3lx,1574395203.0,He will move past the anger eventually and remember that you were there. Visit every day and call when you can. Being there is the most important thing you can do now. Listen and give love. Good luck.
mentalhealth,f6y0gzz,t3_dtmqje,1573263965.0,Happy birthday! Try to do one thing every day that makes you happy- even if it’s small.
Swingers,f0km4gk,t3_d4o2yt,1568682421.0,Go to a strip club and get a lap dance together or go to a kink club and just watch.... That’s where we started and it was a nice way to ease into it.

relationship_advice,ezp7qg7,t3_d1ka8d,1568034921.0,"You did everything right. I can’t imagine how hard this is but the only way for you guys to get better is for her to get better first. Once you get contact again, support and love as much as you can. Things will get better but she needs some help first."
relationships,ewx3wt3,t3_cqech9,1565843493.0,"Has he ever said I love you to anyone (past girlfriends)? Does his family say it a lot or ever?! Honestly, even though two years in, my immediate reaction is to say he should be able to say it.... I just wonder how comfortable he is saying it in general. Sounds like he has been up front with you saying he’s not great with emotions.... he may not even know what Love is.... or that he loves you, especially if it’s not something he’s very familiar with. I’d talk to him about it. But yes, enjoy your vacation and figure out what YOU want."
mentalhealth,evbg9mu,t3_cj4500,1564376272.0,"Not sure where you are, but you can always call a mental health hotline and ask for their suggestion... talk through what is happening with your friend and what the next steps are. PERT (psychiatric emergency response team) can also come out to assess and take him to the hospital if need be. This does sound like a manic episode (although can’t say for sure) and you need to make sure he is getting sleep! Try not to argue with any of his ideas, as this may agitate him, but just listen and BE THERE. Good luck my friend."
exmormon,etq28m0,t3_ccuu1d,1563070577.0,You are beautiful!!!
