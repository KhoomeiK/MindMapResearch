BPD,fozugpo,t1_fozmq7v,1588197070.0,"Thank you. I’m tired of seeing posts where people basically stigmatize their own disorder on this sub. It irks me when people so confidently attribute all of their behaviors to BPD. The part about the IQ of a granola bar was so insulting. It’s a personality disorder...it has nothing to do with IQ. To be clear, I’m not saying that OP doesn’t have BPD or that these behaviors aren’t a part of their unique experience... but it’s just that. Don’t project your constant lying and leading people on etc. to everyone else with BPD."
legaladvice,fkqxhdn,t1_fkpz6sx,1584457656.0,Thank you. This has me worried... after my past few seizures I’ve been more sore than I ever have been. I even have trouble getting out of bed and it’s been almost 2 weeks. It’s incredibly painful to lift my arms or legs. Could this be related?

getting_over_it,fjd7kor,t3_fcq9t2,1583247480.0,"For me, it’s really helpful to just take baby steps. Maybe today, you set a goal to shower. 
Not much for the average person, but when I’m depressed, it seems like a massive obstacle, and generally makes me feel much better and accomplished when I do. 

Maybe the next day, you try making yourself a nice, nutritious meal. The next day you can tackle tidying your room/laundry/etc. 

I know it’s very hard. I always put a lot of pressure on myself to “snap out of it” without realizing that the pressure I was putting on myself was making things worse. Be gentle with yourself. Small milestones do add up. Use baby steps to build momentum. And congratulate yourself on small victories. 

Stay strong. You are not alone. You got this."
vegan,fivft88,t1_fiuvw2m,1582759545.0,I don’t think they’re complaining in that comment at all. I think they’re just clarifying that the choice is just that—a financial one. I mean I can also see people who *do* eat dairy criticizing Pizza Hut and the “crazy vegans” for making this switch to plant based cheese. So they were merely pointing out that it’s a matter of bottom line.

It really makes me angry when health professionals undermine mental health and the like. I had a doctor tell me to come back when I’m underweight before after I told them I was b/ping 4 times daily.
