Why doesn't the average American vote for their own best interests? Genuine question. I think that we see this type of voting happen (voting on a political party position rather than our own personal needs) in Canada and elsewhere in the western world, but for those of us elsewhere in the western world who have lived our whole lives with universal healthcare, it is so difficult for us to imagine not voting for what we consider to be a basic right as a citizen/permanent resident. This type of cost is astronomical. How does anyone live an entire life full of normal healthcare needs (infections, minor injuries, giving birth, etc.) and not go bankrupt? I am genuinely seriously interested in why anyone would not put the issue of universal healthcare at the top of their voting preferences.

The majority of the Carribean, while west is geography does not share a cultural tie to the western world. My dad is from Jamaica and he called it the 'third world' meaning it is far less developed and has significant economic and social challenges. Jamaica only became an independent nation in 1962 when many old colonial countries gained independence. Jamaica has always been culturally different from the UK and the west with massive influences of West African culture, and in the last 2 centuries, influence from Chinese immigrants brought I by the British to build rail infrastructure and east Indians. Jamaica has a strong culture of food that mixes old African cooking styles the slaves brought, slave food like breadfruit, and Indian spices like curry.

With a few nice splurges (4-day safari and a hot air balloon ride over the Masai Mara and a snorkeling trip in the Indian ocean). We used Uber a lot and tuktuks. Plan it yourself and be brave. We had Just a fabulous time. Everyone spoke English, a lot of people spoke German. It was beautiful!! Cannot recommend East Africa enough!!"
PersonalFinanceCanada,fj4gg1f,t1_fj3f7rc,1583007683.0,"Yup! I'm a middle class earner and most of my colleagues earn ~100k. They all buy lunch out EVERY DAY. They'll ask me how my husband and I afford our vacationing (we went to Kenya for 3 weeks last year and did a short safari while we were there) and I just look at their takeout lunch and look at my packed lunch and say it's right here. You're spending $15/day on lunch. Times that by 5 days a week, times 48 weeks a year. Boom that's 3600 dollars! Our three weeks with a safari and airfare and food and drinks didn't equal that much.

EDIT if you times that by 2 people working and add take out coffee you're easily looking at $10k/year per couple. But yeah, some people prioritize daily convenience. It's all so personal how you spend and don't spend. Personally, we also prioritize clothing, so brown bag lunches forever!

2nd EDIT: I'm an idiot. 15 *5 *48= 3600 not 10,000+ somehow I had slippy fingers on my calculator and did a *3 at the end for literally no reason."

news,figzvkk,t1_figu83y,1582405019.0,"No she's not. She wanted to be a good mom. She got lost and off track. We all make mistakes. We all get lost. Her mistake was the biggest mistake anyone could make. She has to live with it. She lost her baby. She gave birth to a still baby. I hope that never happens to you. Because giving birth to a still baby is the most horrific experience a human could go through. She understands her mistake and the gravity of it more than anyone else ever will. She is sharing her story to help other people who are lost like she was. She's trying to share what she's learned to help others. She's not a piece of shit, she's human. And humans are fundamentally flawed.

*EDIT* Wow my first silver, thank you kind Redditor! I'm glad to see more upvotes than downvotes on a comment about forgiveness, empathy, and the shared struggle we as humans have just fumbling through life trying to do our best. Life is hard and it's full of tough decisions. May any of you who feel regretful regarding any of your life decisions, I pass on this piece of solace: You made the best decision you could with the information you had at the time."
news,figyks5,t1_fig0cdw,1582404696.0,"So I live in Ontario and birthing at home with a midwife is really, really common here. Midwives are covered by OHIP (our public health care) and are considered legitimate medical professionals and have to have specialized degrees and have a professional body that oversees the profession. When considering a home birth your midwife will decide whether it is responsible to permit it (considerations are things like how many live births you have had before, your age, distance from the hospital, and other risk factors such as whether the mother has gestational diabetes, and so on). And even after all things considered, the midwife will make conservative calls on when to call the ambulance and get to a hospital. Some anecdotal stats: I have 4 women in my life who I am very very close to. Of these 4 women who all chose to have a home birth with the assistance of a midwife, 3 wound up in the hospital due to their midwife making the professional decision that home was no longer a safe option. In sum, I trust the midwifery profession to make safe and responsible decisions all while advocating for the dignity of mom."

And he always drilled it I to me that all you have to do is ensure that you/your house isn't the path of least resistance. He said criminals are like electricity. Just make sure you don't look like a target and put layers of safeguards wherever possible.

 Lock the door as soon as you shut it. Every time. 

 Same with the car. Everywhere, no matter what.

Sometimes I feel so hurt and unheard and get overwhelmed with the feeling that nothing will ever be resolved that I use my words as weapons trying to show the other person that I'm hurting by hurting them. It's almost like I want them to hurt as much as me so they will finally understand how much I'm hurting. 

Growing up my family never talked about feelings - not happy, sad, or otherwise. I struggle to talk about my feelings and easily become overwhelmed. Honestly, if anyone has any advice, I'm all ears."
