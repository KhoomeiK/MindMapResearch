If the VRM is unable to sustain the voltages because the load exceeds the supply then the system becomes unstable. There is no way to correct for this, you can't predict it in advance and reduce the clocks.

What's to dispute. He wasn't charged, he wasn't convicted. It only happened as a consideration in his sentencing.

In an appeal, there are a limited number of things you can actually appeal. Typically you appeal things that were considered at trial, new evidence, and procedural or legal errors, etc. Things which lead to the conviction.

If you're not charged with it, your not tried for it and you're not convicted of it. Why would it be a subject in your appeal?

And if your appeal judge is considering it, despite the fact you're not charged with it, tried for it or convicted for it then isn't the appeal court acting questionably too?

So why would his lawyers include it in his appeal? His appeal is this: I was convicted of an offence for which my sentence is so excessive as to be cruel and unusual. Please correct this injustice.

And it's absolutely true, his punishment does not fit the crime for which he was convicted. That's it, that's all that actually matters. 

In his trial and in his appeal the process has been perverted by judges. His conviction wasn't unsafe, his punishment is."

The blackness of space is more down to your eye not being sensitive enough to see the light transiting toward from the direction you're looking in. There is plenty of light there, as Hubble found, but we just don't see it. Even in a dark room, there is light, you just can't see it.
