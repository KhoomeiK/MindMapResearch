GreenParty,fojqlvy,t1_fojfpor,1587827291.0,"Im kinda sad neoliberalism is more popular in the mainstream than leftism and progressivism which is socially libertarian and economically left and not authoritarian.  

I think this generation gets it though: be free to express yourself and your opinion like social media, starting a business from your PC and phone (me), but being sustainable, responsible, keeping 2008 in mind and remembering your parents loosing jobs whenever a banker tells you he's the good guy, and demanding a country that pioneers a green new deal, the best single payer system in the world, and reform our criminal justice system. Im in gen Z, but it varies, especially other r/SocialistProgrammers anywhere from age 18-76, influenced by our belief freedom of information and the freedom to share and discuss said information.  

A lot of millenials are progressive, i applaud the ones who are fully progressive, not neoliberal PC police focused on image and paint over the problem not the policy and honesty to actually fix it.  Gen X is neoliberal ususlly with some progressives and conservative in the mix, the 80s and the cold war keeps a lot of them still more right leaning, at least economically.  We all know boomers about boomers no need to discuss them.  My theory as a software developer and based on reading Marx, Chomsky, 30s UAW pioneer from my home city Detroit Walter P. Reuther, and and studying Moore's law is the cheaper computers become, the more the political compass points in the SW direction economically.

Easy internet access and its ability to disrupt awful traditional labor models (see corporate wage slavery) is what is driving this change and why its being pushed back against (see right wingers and big business halting/reversing net neutrality, refusing to support free universal nationwide broadband internet which would give them customers).  That is allowing tons of people to quit there jobs and do e commerce home businesses thru social media.  Its only a matter of time until someone makes a unified, quality social media commerce platform that allows people to also perform services and rentals and automatically handles the papereork for them (I'm almost done an app doing just that).  Check it out @StartShareApp if you're interested (Twitter), I'm releasing it May 20th, unless Michigan is still under quarantine.  

Only downside with taking on the challenge, is a) I'm a 20 year old college student and though I've been programming since middle school. b) because im a small team of my close friends from high school, I'm not exactly Microsoft Corporation, so our users though they earn more fair cuts than uber or ebay for sales (70% of purchase price goes to user, 6% tax, 24% to us which handles internal costs) are contractors so its not like you truly have a *""job""* job that gives health insurance. That's why i gladly say ill pay more in tax, even my business will, if it means EVERYONE can be covered, not just those with a good job."

adderall,foihnyo,t1_foevi4u,1587786890.0,"I hear in Europe, Novartis (swiss) developed Ritalin (methylphenidate) is more commonly prescribed, except in England and ireland.   It's a tried tried and true medicine, and i took the ritalin (methylphenidate) based Concerta for a while and it worked well for me.  

Tips:

I find ritalin Immediate Release lasts 2-3 hours.  Great for when an 8 hour extended release pill wears off, it can get you through the school day or work day.  If you still have important tasks like homework or work project's, that's when the immediate release 2-3 hour pill will come in handy.  If you can get an extended release formulation, your body will adjust to it better!  If not, eat small light meals in between your doses to feed your body's at that monent increased metabolism.  Dont go overboard on the coffee, its better to cut back because it's a stimulant too; you'd be asking at that point basically to stay up all night laying in bed staring at the ceiling in boredom.  Possible other side effects: no appetite.  Ive several times gone almost a day without eating bc i forgot to, there was no urge to eat.  The lack of appetite and thus lack of food intake is what i think contribures to ritalin/adderalls side effects like headache, irritability, dizziness, and lightheadedness. 

Best of luck my man, i hope everything works out great!  When I was 16 and first put on Concerta it literally turned my life around and made me realize I can accomplish things."

I see both as medicine, weed is great for emotion, creativity, and introspection, but you need dopamine if youre adhd, not just cannabinoids to manage its effects.  Yes, THC and CBD relieve ADHD exacerbated depression, apathy, mood swings, emotional problems, but .  Adderall is chemically different from speed by several carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen atoms, which plays a role in its toxicity.  Adderall, Vyvanse, and Ritalin all are synaptogenic like cannabis and CBD (synaptogenic - increases number of neural synapses), and we even have long term therapy studies conforming that adhd meds decrease structural abnormalities in the brain.

We're called speed freaks by media figures left and right of the aisle for taking a schedule II medicine that's several atoms different from meth and isnt the same thing.  The people who really give it a bad name are the people who abuse it for a cheap high. 

I support all drugs with therapeutic potential and low mortality rates being legal for the adult population to purchase, produce, and consume.  A high dose of adderall can sometimes feel indistinguishable visually  from a microdose of acid in my experience.  The visuals look similarly slightly melty, very minor drifting, and very minor tracers, but an increased visual enhancement.  I regularly take adhd meds exactly as prescribed, but on occasion will take 2 pills not 1 and pull an all nighter to get a big development hurdle cleared for my app."

My self imposed 3 weeks medication break (did it for longer with Adderall too during the summer going into college, and a 20mg adderall exacerbared full on daily panic attacks) and it was awful bc i just felt like i was in a haze and I have important task coming up.   I want to minimize tolerance building up too fast"
adderall,foglb3x,t1_fogl2ui,1587754039.0,"I'm enjoying my low tolerance, but yeah i usually dont take it unless i have a big project im working on"
adderall,fogl3by,t1_fogk94j,1587753951.0,"Year and a half adderall, and 2 and a half years of concerta.  Been on vyvanse for a month, but i took a 2 week break."
adderall,fogi2x1,t1_fog1p8q,1587752856.0,Yeah stimulants can be addictive!   One definately should be cautious with them as too many is bad for the heart
adderall,fog0gc1,t1_fog01ai,1587745993.0,"The way vyvanse works as a prodrug and gradually kicks in is why imo its better than the immediate rush you get fron of an adderall or ritalin.  Ive noticed hard crashes from adderall and being so irritable, anger/ranting when ritalin wore off, but this is so smooth if im in a pissed off mood, i probably didnt take my vyvanse lol."
adderall,fog01ko,t1_fofyqxc,1587745792.0,"Yeah, that's why im on prozac for true mood elevation, but i clearly lack dopamine based on how unfuckingmotivated i am without my meds."
adderall,fofzt1s,t3_f65ayu,1587745677.0,"Take the vyvanse.  Smoke or eat pot for pain trust me, i had Norco during wisdom teeth and taking it daily every 4 hours to manage to not cry bc of the most paunful painful swelling and hematoma.   I had immediate withdrawals once stopping (flu like symptoms, shaking, diarrhea) after only 2 weeks as prescribed by the surgeon.  I was 17, that whole 2 weeks the opiate caused a headspace of perpetual doom, fear, and some strong belief that i was destined to have a horrible life and be unloved.  It was nothing short of scary and insane, i dont wish ANYONE go through that.  Pain sucks, my mom has fibromyalgia and i have migraines and so i get where youre coming from.  What helped me stay sane and even numbed the pain during my norco journey was straight up ritalin.  Vyvanse and adderall do the same thing too.  It potentiated the pain killing effects of the narcotic while reversing sedation.  I take vyvanse, and when i go without it"

The way it  harmoniously is accepted by the serotonin receptors and can relieve depression/anxiety without causing emotional blunting like my prescription meds did AND  accurately measure doses unlike shrooms down to the miligram.  The shrooms community loves shrooms  memes despite pushing for acceptance and idk why we cant do both too. 

The only persons perverting this drug are idiots who take so much they think theyre dying and go to the ER"
