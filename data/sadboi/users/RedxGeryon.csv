demsocialists,foz743y,t1_foykw0p,1588185790.0,"Oh, thanks for that perspective. You're right. We have to be able to be critical of ourselves as socialists and learn and grow as people. Not just literally doing it for the clout which is what his campaign feels like unfortunately. We need to be able to put forward a serious, thoughtful alternative that can contend with the current politics in a way that knows how to build a movement. I'm all about getting as many people involved in fighting for popular demands because that process in itself will get people involved in class struggle politics. I'll just keep campaigning with the state level candidate for now, and living my life. Solidarity friend!"
demsocialists,fox5717,t1_fowfm7i,1588134351.0,"I'm in this district. I don't know about that specific issue but I've worked with him and talked with him a bit directly as a volunteer. His campaign has got a LOT of money and done very good at fundraising because he knows how to market himself to leftists all across the country. That's not a bad thing. However, the way he does it is off-putting to most everyday people I know (even just casual Bernie supporters). Like, I try to get friends and family who supported Bernie interested in his campaign and when they look at his social media to learn more about him they can be put off. His campaign's messaging has too much of a self-centered approach and he's bad at public speaking imo the couple times I heard him speak. It's a negative and self-centered ""I had a hard life and I hate my political opponents/predecessors for these reasons"" rather than a positive movement-building ""I am looking forward to building a better future with you all, let's talk about how we can do that"" kind of approach that he uses, and I think that just puts off people who might otherwise be interested in his politics.

I'm voting for him regardless, but I stopped putting my time into his campaign and am instead volunteering for someone on the state level for these reasons because I don't realistically see him winning. Just because he has managed get a lot of money from a bunch of online leftists online with his takes on Twitter doesn't mean he actually has his district in the bag. That's the sober reality, unfortunately. 

Also, he seeked our DSA chapter endorsement, we gladly gave it to him, then their campaign wouldn't communicate anything to us for months after we reached out to them a handful of times, and suddenly is working with Kshama Sawant and SA. That's not a bad thing in itself, but the way he did it felt like he was trying to burn a bridge because he just shut us out of that process. That's not how you build solidarity with people who want to support you. You gotta keep us in the know rather than shut us out, it felt like he just used us for an endorsement and then ran off without feeling like he had to be accountable to our chapter at all... Oh well. Continuing to organize and I ""critically support"" him. There could be something that happened that I don't know about"
