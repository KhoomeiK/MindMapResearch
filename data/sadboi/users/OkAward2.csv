OCD,fr3bkkq,t1_fqzyrls,1589853894.0,Thanks! I‚Äôll check it out
PanicAttack,fqbt194,t3_ghw6qw,1589243352.0,Can you share which brand you use?
PanicAttack,fpzy6d9,t3_gfwq1e,1589025424.0,Absolutely. When I have a bad one it will linger for about a week. When I first started getting them it lasted like a month it felt like. Therapy was the only thing that helped me. Hang in there you will feel better soon these feelings don‚Äôt last forever
Anxiety,fpy22mk,t3_gg45u4,1588994326.0,Mine is the worst in the morning. When I wake up I have to immediately play a podcast so I‚Äôm not with my own thoughts. At night I find it the most peaceful to not have any TV playing or anything but that‚Äôs just my preference. If the anxiety is really bad I probably still keep it on as background noise. The headspace all helps me the most at night time if I need to play anything
Chihuahua,fpo8bqe,t1_fpmncy4,1588780122.0,He‚Äôs the cutest! I don‚Äôt want him to get bigger üò≠üò≠üò≠
AskDoctorSmeeee,foe58eq,t3_g6x3ew,1587696279.0,"It seems similar to trigeminal neuralgia, have you heard or research more into that to see if it seems like a possible match? I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this. I have occipital neuralgia. Some of your symptoms are familiar to me but not all. I know that trigeminal is different in some aspects and can be more drastic. If you do find this as a possibility, dry needling has helped me a lot  in the past to help the nerves. Get well soon!"
AskDoctorSmeeee,fo5fg9i,t3_g5o1qz,1587524359.0,Had this exact thing happen before. It was so painful for like 7 days straight. Then became more bearable then eventually just grew out and healed. I didn‚Äôt even know there was anything else to do besides give it some time. Good luck!
PanicAttack,fnnik25,t3_g2q72r,1587093186.0,"I‚Äôm so glad you posted this. I‚Äôve been trying to explain the same exact thing to my therapist lately. I thought it was just me. It used to be the opposite, but like you said now it‚Äôs physical first then triggers the mental aspect"
HealthAnxiety,fnnicqd,t1_fnma8qg,1587093053.0,"Haha! I didn‚Äôt even think of that aspect of it in terms of responses. But yes, periods can sometimes mess with me. I‚Äôve never gotten extreme fatigue though"
HealthAnxiety,fnni5ru,t1_fnm5vqk,1587092924.0,Not too much different. But there is probably room for improvement
HealthAnxiety,fnni2xd,t1_fnngcn0,1587092872.0,I work the opening shift. So 5am-3pm. I‚Äôm home pretty early in the day which is nice but I never feel like getting anything done afterwards. I usually get 6-7hrs of sleep at night. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs not enough maybe? I just can‚Äôt get myself to fall asleep any earlier
HealthAnxiety,fnn9y3t,t1_fnm3r8e,1587087641.0,I JUST finished it and started my new pill pack. I‚Äôve never had it happen right after but maybe it‚Äôs playing a part?
HealthAnxiety,fnn98jt,t1_fnmdsux,1587087195.0,Thank you!  I think I am going to reach out to my doctor to get some blood work done. I have had low vitamin D in the past so I started to take a supplement today just incase
HealthAnxiety,fnn9589,t1_fnmjnhq,1587087138.0,I have been pretty active. I‚Äôm a manager at Mcdoanlds I‚Äôm on my feet for at least 10 hours 5/7 days. I‚Äôve also been trying to workout more too. But lately it feels harder to do
OCD,fma10r7,t1_fm9ctxb,1585881188.0,Thank you for your kind words. I needed to hear that
AskDoctorSmeeee,fm8tysa,t3_ftr8af,1585855980.0,"It looks just like a blood blister. I get them periodically in the same spot. Probably because I still have my wisdom teeth so I often pinch the back of my gums w/out realizing. They come and go. If it grows or doesn‚Äôt go away, ask your dentist about it."
AskDocs,fm6gdyd,t1_flt0dnu,1585793463.0,Oh interesting! I will have to look into the home test kits! Thanks!
AskDocs,flshana,t1_flq0029,1585442110.0,Oh okay thanks! I have high CRP levels. I‚Äôve always wished they had a home test to monitor it
AskDocs,flplzzf,t3_fq1e1i,1585362733.0,"I‚Äôm not much of a help with diagnosis, but how are you measuring your CRP so often?"
obgyn,fl8wkkt,t3_fn5nxu,1584934153.0,This is a special circumstance (covid-19) that is out of your control. I‚Äôm almost positive they will call in at least 1-2 months refill to your pharmacy and get your appt scheduled for after that
Anxiety,fl2wsqs,t3_flvow6,1584761992.0,"Yep! I started to take a probiotic after learning that the gut can sometimes be more sensitive than the brain, hence why anxiety causes stomach issues (in my case I get terrible butterfly feelings). It might just be in my head but the daily probiotic helped"
AskDocs,fkz99mh,t3_flbvwq,1584665676.0,"I would say go to ER. However, to answer your question about the humidifier, I just dealt with bronchitis for 3 weeks. A humidifier made my symptoms feel worse. Whether that is backed up by science or not, I don‚Äôt know. I hope you find relief soon. Feel better!"
AskReddit,fiwa2f9,t3_fa00m2,1582779108.0,"$100,000 tomorrow cause I‚Äôm desperate"
HealthAnxiety,fiooy6l,t1_fiok6h3,1582587624.0,"Thank you for the kind words! I have hoarseness and a slight sore throat, though it‚Äôs mostly just hoarseness without pain. I went to a minute clinic and they said it could just be viral or from allergies and gave me some OTC to try. Hopefully it‚Äôll go away soon! Thanks again"
medical_advice,filr44c,t3_f1u339,1582508299.0,I‚Äôm experiencing a similar sore throat. Did you ever find relief?
obgyn,fghnkxx,t3_eye4bk,1580788971.0,"I‚Äôm sorry. That‚Äôs frustrating your doctor didn‚Äôt explain the results clearly. That‚Äôs her job to inform you of what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôm waiting my results back after an abnormal pap 2x in a row. It‚Äôs so terrifying so I feel your pain. However, it‚Äôs common and there are multiple steps to take to get them removed/monitored. I would suggest that you call your doctor and ask her to explain why she felt the need to refer you and to better understand what her concern was. I think she owes you that. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve done this but have you had general blood tests done because of your other symptoms? Good luck! Remember, you are young and your body can mostly repair itself. But it‚Äôs good you are following up on your health!"
obgyn,fgg0wbn,t3_e99a18,1580751837.0,I‚Äôm going through almost the same thing. How did your experience end up? Did the spotting go away?
OCD,ffzycxi,t1_ffvg6ow,1580396018.0,Yes I‚Äôm currently in therapy. Once every other week
ADHD,fdm95nc,t3_chfloz,1578542914.0,Did you ever get relief or figure out the cause? I‚Äôm currently going through the same thing
OCD,fb9q92a,t3_eby6tf,1576646011.0,This is specifically one of my biggest fears. I feel you on this 100%. I‚Äôve never acted like I had it...but I still fear so deeply that I might develops it. Especially becz of the intrusive thoughts and how they can make me feel so unlike myself. Then I become a wreck because I won‚Äôt stop worrying about it for days and days at a time
OCD,fb9q0kw,t3_ebymnw,1576645791.0,"Mindfulness has helped me tremendously. The headspace app in particular. You can search almost any topic on there, even intrusive thoughts. And they have good meditations on it that really help it all feel more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù which in turn reminds me that I‚Äôm not as crazy as I feel at times."
BirdsArentReal,f9t1pcw,t3_e6qkdm,1575606157.0,A bird wrote this
OCD,f9t1ht9,t3_e6hatu,1575605985.0,I appreciate this post a whole lot
insomnia,f83vh5u,t3_dyoa6q,1574222070.0,"Nightmares sometimes make my insomnia worse because it makes me more uncomfortable to fall asleep, if I even can. But this is a good perspective on how to look at it from now on. I tend to have worse nightmares during bad flare ups with insomnia (basically if I do sleep, I‚Äôm having a nightmare)"
science,f80powm,t3_dy8xkk,1574134943.0,Currently 24. Can confirm.
medical,f7ixpgt,t1_f7gxzr9,1573767252.0,"My tonsil is still swollen. Though I think it has been bigger than my right for most of my life but to me looked bigger recently. As for the lymph node, my doctor said that what I was feeling was actually a salivary gland under my jaw and that it felt normal in size. 

Basically, my ENT said he doesn‚Äôt see anything that is even alarming right now. But like yours said, if I notice changes or more swelling I can go back in to see him. He also said there‚Äôs no need to consider getting my tonsils removed which is another thing I was worried about. Since seeing the doctor I haven‚Äôt had any pain or worsening symptoms. Hope you find relief soon!"
Anxiety,f7ghgxl,t3_dvyy6k,1573703990.0,Then the medicine helps and you finally try to get off it only to experience worse symptoms thus leading you to stay on it for much longer
educationalgifs,f6oen3q,t3_ds7aqy,1573015275.0,This was actually extremely informative. Not that I‚Äôm ever going to try this. But I feel like I have a high success rate if I ~were~ to give it a go
Wellthatsucks,f6oefrv,t1_f6ns9wq,1573015085.0,As if I wasn‚Äôt already depressed enough
science,f5ol0lh,t3_doec4b,1572321245.0,Gut x Brain connection is real. I struggle with anxiety and resonated with the part about sleep being the brains way of ‚Äútaking out the trash‚Äù. I get the worst anxiety as soon as I wake up in the morning. It makes sense now that maybe it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt ever sleep well.
OCD,f5irbg0,t1_f5dcwv4,1572217324.0,Thank you I like that!
OCD,f5iqvqc,t1_f5cr7zu,1572217189.0,Thank you! I‚Äôve heard this one a lot so I will try my best to start practicing that. All these years I would get repetitive thoughts and negative thoughts over and over. I never knew it could be anything besides anxiety. Media portrays OCD in a different light than what it really is/can be. I wish I knew sooner when it wasn‚Äôt as bad as it is now
OCD,f5458jv,t3_dmec4l,1571971500.0,I love this lol. I was recently diagnosed with OCD after years of treating it as anxiety alone. I love the humor in this awfulness lol
thebachelor,f52vdg6,t3_dm6v8i,1571953584.0,"The only part of this that I think is bad is that she showed the girls user name....other than that I think Kaitlyn just came to the group to get support. She‚Äôs only human. Even if it was to get some reassurance from fans that we still liked the pod, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a crime. We all like to be reassured of ourselves and our careers when we hit a low point. For someone to tell you they are happy they didn‚Äôt get tickets for your upcoming tour would hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings. I‚Äôve seen her live show and I cried like a baby when I met her back stage. She‚Äôs a good person, even when she has ‚Äúslip ups‚Äù like this one. I think all she wanted to do was share her anxious feelings with a group of girls that support her. I know Kaitlyn would never have wanted people attacking another person over social media and I highly doubt she even considered the possibility of people directly attacking this girl (becz who does that?!). We also don‚Äôt know what else that account has DMed her in the past....you just never know what else goes into someone‚Äôs decisions like this. Right or wrong. 

As for the actual content of the podcast, I‚Äôve listened to it since day one. I don‚Äôt see a huge change. Sure, some episodes are less interesting than others but that goes for any type of reoccurring entertainment. I see constructive criticism in the FB group often about the podcast (with 100+) there‚Äôs no way she‚Äôs never read through those because she even mentions certain points brought up when does her podcast. She‚Äôs up for a People‚Äôs Choice and she wants to win it so so badly for Off The Vine. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs where some of her anxiety played a roll too. Maybe she felt like she would never achieve that now."
medical,f4zz4vt,t1_f4z29st,1571918879.0,I‚Äôm glad to hear everything looks fine though! My left tonsil has always been bigger than my right for at least as long as I can recall. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs nothing. I go to an ENT on Tuesday
medical,f4ysj76,t3_bqokes,1571884189.0,I‚Äôm having a similar issue. Did you ever find out what it was?
Anxiety,f4ue4ja,t3_dlrd1k,1571807139.0,Yep! I call it a panic hangover! Don‚Äôt feel worried about it. Sometimes lasts 1-3 days for me
orthotropics,f4ox4pi,t3_c8lw9p,1571710427.0,"This is an old post but just curious if you ever went to see a doctor? I have a similar issue and like you, it has been this way for as long as I can remember. It has just not occurred to me that it could be something to worry about"
PanicAttack,f3spi33,t3_dho7g3,1571106628.0,Meditation only helps me as a preventative sometimes. If I‚Äôm getting an attack there‚Äôs rarely anything that can help stop it. At least not that I‚Äôve learned yet
DiagnoseMe,f3q13zo,t1_f3be6lo,1571068047.0,Thanks for the response! I tried antibiotics but didn‚Äôt help much. I get my wisdom teeth out soon  plus I am getting two cavities filled this week so maybe that will help my symptoms also!
Anxiety,f2emfkr,t1_f2eiged,1570199130.0,Mine is definitely worse in the morning as well. I‚Äôve been trying to do a little meditating before I even get out of bed and it helps a little. I get the nausea too. It feels like super intense butterflies
DiagnoseMe,f19obvq,t3_d1k33p,1569275156.0,Just saw your post. Having similar symptoms. Did your symptoms ever get better?
insomnia,ezy49hr,t3_d2ri0c,1568257330.0,I‚Äôm in the same boat as you right now. Last week was good for me but this week has been awful. You aren‚Äôt alone. I hope you feel better soon! The only thing that helps me is to remind myself that sometimes this happens and I just have to wait it out and take care of myself the best I can in the meantime
PanicAttack,ezy3hu5,t1_ezx0ewr,1568256705.0,One thing that helps me is trying to stay busy but with things that are enjoyable. Hanging out with people you care about and trying to show the panic that you‚Äôre the boss and can continue on even if it creeps in. Being alone is the enemy of any anxiety because it will just keep fueling itself. I hope you feel better soon!
PanicAttack,ezvea54,t3_d1altc,1568175032.0,"It just takes time. It feels like a panic attack ‚Äúhangover‚Äù. I‚Äôve been there before too and also felt like I was going crazy. Your body is trying to adjust back to normal and it‚Äôs bound to make you feel a little off because you endured stress and trauma going through your panic attack. Try to think of it as getting through a bad viral infection/cold/flu.  Even when you start to feel better, you still don‚Äôt feel fully like yourself. But you would never judge yourself for getting over a cold because you understand that it takes a little bit of time to fully heal from it. Similar to a panic attack, your mind and body are trying to heal and return back to your normal self. Which will be soon I promise!"
PanicAttack,ezvdy4a,t3_d1ueaz,1568174712.0,"I‚Äôve been in your shoes before. And I likely will again at some point. Just keep reminding yourself that your body and mind are capable of returning itself back to normal with little intervention. It‚Äôs an awful state of mind to be in, but it will without a doubt go back to normal soon   Try to go easy on yourself in the mean time"
PanicAttack,ezvdpsb,t1_ezrrvbq,1568174498.0,Can you explain the spray bottle? Is it to keep your body temperature cool?
insomnia,ey79ylk,t3_cvxhpt,1566876025.0,"I got a 15lb weighted blanket and it‚Äôs super small. I don‚Äôt know the exact size, but i feel like it wouldn‚Äôt even fit a twin bed. It‚Äôs the perfect size because if it starts to bother me or I get hot, I can just shove it over and go back to using my normal blanket. But I will say it helps my sleep a lot especially with anxiety that comes up once I lay down

But also I got a goose down comforter. Cheaper than actual down. But still keeps me cool/comfortable at night! Kohl‚Äôs for $80 (can return for full refund if you aren‚Äôt a fan)"
MealPrepSunday,exjnw3g,t3_ct8kib,1566355305.0,Step by step process to making these? All those different flavors taste good together?
PanicAttack,esna7bf,t3_c82i0j,1562126605.0,"If you are going on a night time flight I don‚Äôt think Benadryl would be a bad idea. I‚Äôve done that before and it helps. But if it‚Äôs a morning/daytime flight it might not be worth it. Try to download podcasts/music before the flight.  It might be too late for you to do this now but I got noise cancelling headphones that have worked wonders on plane rides. I can‚Äôt hear anything besides what I have playing from my phone! I also go for aisle seats because if panic or anxiety starts up, I feel like the extra space from the aisle/ability to stand up without climbing over people is super helpful! 

One more thing. Look into videos/articles about progressive muscle relaxation. I recently had to fly and got a panic attack as we were taking off. I closed my eyes and did PMR and it helped tremendously."
PanicAttack,esn9mcc,t3_c8j9pu,1562126160.0,I‚Äôm really sorry you feel like this. I‚Äôve struggled with it my whole life but back in April I had the worst panic attack I‚Äôve ever experienced. I also went to the ER thinking I was either dying or going crazy. It lasted probably a full 2 weeks for me but then ebbed and flowed up until recently. I know that seems like a scary thing to read but just know that none of the symptoms you are feeling right now are not permanent no matter how bad it seems. You will get through it and the anxiety will pass. PM me if you need to talk about anything! You are not alone in this and you are strong enough to get through it. I hope you feel better soon!
AskReddit,eqtc474,t3_bz71uc,1560308121.0,Meningitis. Which is exactly what I‚Äôm afraid of
Wellthatsucks,eqqcu97,t3_byybmq,1560218020.0,Of course it happened in Florida
insomnia,eq56ji0,t1_eq4yqn0,1559793862.0,What happened for you? Curious because I‚Äôve been trying to get off it. I noticed some side effects when I tried to but I didn‚Äôt know if it was from going to a lower dose or just a coincidence in timing
insomnia,eq56drs,t3_bxa9t9,1559793765.0,"I‚Äôve been on it for over 2 years. Went back and forth between 50mg-100mg for sleep. Works well for me most of the time but not a miracle. The only side effect I have is that I can‚Äôt take it past 11pm if I have work the next morning. If I know I‚Äôll be going to bed late and have to be up, I‚Äôll break it in half"
Anxiety,eq19qhp,t3_bwk24s,1559704202.0,Yes I get this too. Sometimes it‚Äôs worse with people I‚Äôm close with like my friends. One thing that has somewhat helped ease the paranoid/frustrating feelings is positive affirmations. Affirmation podcast with Josie Ong is my go to because it‚Äôs too hard for me to think of them on my own
MealPrepSunday,epz6ym6,t1_epz232q,1559659714.0,Do you add any broth or anything? When I bake chicken it always turns out dry. I can‚Äôt understand how people get it right hahah
PanicAttack,epz6ma4,t1_epyawe7,1559659508.0,"Yep! I‚Äôm not sure which ones you get but I basically feel like I get the flu. GI issues get all weird and I get intense shivering as well. When I am in full blown panic mode I‚Äôm so hyper aware of every part of my body and if anything feels a little off I start to worry about what might be happening. But even those symptoms are stemming from your brain lying to you about what‚Äôs going on. What I do that has been helpful is try to accept the feelings as they happen and remind myself that it will pass as long as I let it. If I try to resist the feelings, it only makes it worse. There is a book by Helen Odessky called ‚Äústop anxiety from stopping you‚Äù. It‚Äôs a simple read but very informative and straight to the point regarding panic attacks and tips to handle them. It‚Äôs been very helpful for me. Even more so than other therapies I have tried. Hope you feel better soon, you‚Äôre not alone in this!"
PanicAttack,epy4csn,t3_bwjcec,1559618997.0,"Coming off of a month and a half struggle with my panic attacks. For a while I felt like I was never going to be the same again and felt like it was just getting worse and worse. But it will pass and trust that your body will return itself back to normal without much intervention (trying to control your breathing/thoughts/symptoms/etc)  It‚Äôs easier said than done though. My panic attacks tend to make me depressed on top of it all so it can be hard to get through it sometimes. Right now I feel mostly back to myself, which seems so strange to me at times. Going from one extreme to the other can feel so weird!"
sleep,ep9h6gq,t1_ep8u0kb,1559110034.0,"Hmm maybe try to make a habit of drinking the most right when you wake up and while heading to work. Try to pack water dense foods to snack on at lunch like cucumbers, watermelon, strawberries etc. Maybe try a tracking system to log in how many ounces you get throughout the day to be more conscious of how much you are really drinking and make adjustments as needed. Sorry to hear you don‚Äôt have much opportunity due to work!"
sleep,ep8j8m3,t3_bu6n2x,1559095672.0,"Make sure you are staying hydrated throughout the day. I was told that if you feel thirsty, it means you are already dehydrated"
PanicAttack,ep7tw4p,t1_ep7osar,1559086286.0,Thank you for that!
PanicAttack,eol6sok,t3_bs62od,1558666459.0,Congratulations! How far you‚Äôve come is definitely something to be proud of. I get DP/DR as well and I‚Äôm still new to learning how to cope with it. Thanks for sharing!
