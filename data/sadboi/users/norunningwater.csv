I was coop-ing with a friend and he was just using the set and I tried to talk him out of it. Since you already beat MHW, the initial challenge isn't the same, so using the Defender armor and the third tier of weapons would roll you through it so you can get to Iceborne faster.

If you're just going to play MHW for a while, I recommend not finishing it in a week and leave you wanting Iceborne even more.

Don't hesitate on Iceborne, though. Anyone can tell you it kicks ass."
GameDeals,fpkywpy,t1_fpkvtmz,1588703440.0,"You'll want to have a set of both fire and ice resistant armors, preferably upgraded to be strong enough to handle the high rank, tempered monsters of the base MHW. The armor from the first monster in Iceborne is a good ice defense armor, but fighting that monster for it is a slog through tons of snow and classic Monster Hunter-grade hip checks.

Iceborne is very much worth it, especially if you've beat MHW already. They've added new monsters and areas since release, so paying for it you get more than others did who bought it at release now. It's basically got the same treatment MHW got after release, so the content is basically doubled in the expansion already."
