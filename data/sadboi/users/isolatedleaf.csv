AnorexiaRecovery,fhnamhs,t3_f40xpz,1581724179.0,"I'm so so sorry, it's really hard. Those thoughts are probably horrible to live with. But I promise you, you will be okay. 

I'm not going to say some magical inspirational words, because I don't really know what to say honestly, I'm still struggling. But i know that you are human, and you got into that by caring so much about something , but that care into yourself. Into fueling your body, into being healthy, into stopping all of those little things that still remind you of being malnourished , because your body is still healing and it will take a little while and I know it's terrifying not having the last little bit of it but that's the final step to accepting it. I'm really sorry you're going through this. I'm always here if you need to chat. I hope you can learn to love yourself, and give up this horrible habbit."

mentalhealth,fhfm2ft,t3_f2sa7d,1581546180.0,"That is a perfect way to explain it, im sorry people don't understand. It really sucks especially when things are being said and/or validated to you about it. 

She shouldn't be telling you how to handle things if she doesn't know anything about it, and she shouldn't say things that cause hopelessness like, "" I wish you weren't always at the doctor's."" That is something you need to do and are doing for yourself, to help yourself, you deserve that."
lonely,fhflpl3,t3_f2rsfs,1581545962.0,"yup.. there's so much behind it, more than I've ventured to think about."

AnorexiaRecovery,fgivqbi,t3_eyry3s,1580831945.0,"I'm really fucking proud of you. Baby steps are steps, the most important ones. I'm so glad you realized and feeling happy for yourself, that's also a really good sign, being able to surpass triggers. I'm always always here for you and I'm so glad you are finding your way out of this and how to be healthy and happy. It's a cycle that never ends and it's not worth it. Being happy and having support and warmth and muscle and fat and hair and dopamine is what's worth it. Finding comfort in fueling your body. My chat is always open. Keep up the good work!! ðŸ’œ"
