AmItheAsshole,fk961ku,t1_fk8ui0k,1583969439.0,Oh it means you do them yourself! You get black Indian ink and a needle and some thread to hold the ink and then basically just start giving yourself the tattoo. Sometime people have specific stick n poke kits you can order online with official tattoo ink and real tattoo needles. Basically it means giving them to yourself or friends without a machine doing it. So virtually it’s free besides the kit or supplies.
BipolarReddit,fk934do,t1_fk8puja,1583967746.0,Thank you!
AmItheAsshole,fk8linj,t1_fk8b59k,1583958325.0,Two of my tattoos are stick n pokes so I only really spent money on one. But I totally understand where y’all are coming from

BipolarReddit,fi8eiyd,t3_f7045z,1582238765.0,Congratulations! That’s amazing. Keep pushing through. You got this! :)
bipolar2,fbw54us,t3_eemloc,1577141200.0,"When I have hypomania I talk extremely fast because my mind is just racing with all these thoughts. Completely random thoughts basically all over the place. I’m way more sociable. Will probably drink a lot. 

Overly flirtatious and I have a long term boyfriend and would never think about cheating on him but it comes off that way. 

I don’t sleep really and it’s impossible for me to go to bed. I don’t feel like sleeping but I know that I should if that makes sense so I force myself to but sometimes I just simply can’t. 

I’m extremely productive at my job which is a good thing but I’ll do like 130 tickets and then a few days later fall into my normal rhythm of about 70. So my productivity fluctuates drastically based on how my bipolar disorder is going. 

The scariest part of hypomania is the confidence. I’m extremely impulsive and believe every decision I’m making is the best decision and 100% correct and will not have any consequences. Sometimes it works out for me but sometimes I ruin relationships over it. I’m working on keeping my symptoms in check though. 

I’m a rapid cycler so I’ll usually only have like 2-3 days of hypomania and then a few days of depression. Usually it goes depression, mixed state for a longer time, hypomania, depression but with meds I’m a lot more stable. I just got diagnosed in March so it took a lot of internal reflection to figure out how bipolar disorder affects me personally."
BipolarReddit,fbsisqf,t3_eebg8k,1577055810.0,"Yes! Pets are so incredibly helpful when it comes to mental health. Not only are they a source of comfort but it helps you get out of bed because you have to take them out and feed them. I have two cats and a dog and they are truly a blessing in my life. I don’t know what I would do without them. 

I would definitely recommend a cat because they are so low maintenance and easy. Dogs are phenomenal but a lot of extra work. Dogs I think are more helpful because of this extra work. You have to let them out multiple times a day, take them on walks, obviously feed them. But they’ll cuddle up to you more than a cat will but obviously it depends on the cat. Just find the pet that will work best for you!"
BipolarReddit,fbse4ys,t1_fblkmys,1577054004.0,I got to therapy pretty consistently and it helps. I try to be aware of my triggers as much as possible but things happen and I have to see my family over the holidays so I just try to remember my coping skills as much as possible when I can’t control the external factors and triggers.
BipolarReddit,fbsdrbg,t1_fbjqsha,1577053860.0,I would agree with this. Meds definitely stop my mania. It’s helps with my depression a little but I definitely still get depressive episodes. I’m on Latuda and every med is different so you just gotta find the best one for you.
BipolarReddit,fbsdgo3,t1_fbkch25,1577053745.0,I also have ADHD so it’s been an adventure leveling everything out. Thank you so much for the tips and advice. It’s super helpful! :)
BipolarReddit,fbsd2ka,t1_fbjd0ia,1577053580.0,Never thought about a support group. This is super helpful! Thank you
