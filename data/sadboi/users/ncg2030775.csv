After reading some of the threads I realized that I may do more damage than good and that professionals are are needed for these very serious post.  All I can offer is that I know it will get better. Doesn't it have to?  It takes time though, and its hard, but we can do it. We can beat this.  I'd be glad to talk if you ever need someone to speak with or just vent to.  Hope your day goes well."

AmItheAsshole,ffhv344,t1_ffhgthl,1579955291.0,"This is really interesting to me. I know nothing about autism, but it makes me curious how you speak about these shenanigans. Do you know that what your doing at the time  is a shenanigan or is it something that you have been told after the fact that it wasn't socially acceptable, and therefore now you call it a shenanigan?  Whatever the case I hope they were not to rough on you."

vive_vr,f15zqo7,t1_f15gsqy,1569199249.0,Yeah less comfort options for us who are used to VR and also also maybe a red arrow showing where the ball is heading when you are transported to a outfielder or player so you don't have to look around for the ball.
virtualreality,exghsql,t1_exgdawg,1566264425.0,from what I understand its the depth of the image that affects you. Tv is flat. VR allows you to change  your depth perception as you view.
