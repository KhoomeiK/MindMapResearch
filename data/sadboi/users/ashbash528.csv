Reign,fqhlqq9,t3_gitvt4,1589379548.0,"It's been a while since I've watched the show or gone further in my reading about her. So bare with me on some of my responses!

I don't have an opinion on The Church or John Knox. 

In the show, I think the idea of Mary as a feminist was really turned up. She was loud and proud. Audiences would not have responded well to the subtlety she probably had to use in real life to even be entertained. As for should we historically remember her as a feminist, it depends on how you define feminism. It also depends on how you define their modes of creating progress in gender roles. Mary wanted to be queen, she wanted to be a queen in her own right (seen when denying Darnley the Crown Matrimonial). I would say fighting for right to be seen as an independent, equal to a king ruler would have her classified as a feminist, or at least feminist ideals, the same as Elizabeth. However, is she more or less of a feminist because of her choice of attack? Elizabeth was constantly under pressure to marry, told no one can take her seriously without a husband. Elizabeth blazed her own trail and refused to marry. However, Mary ""played the game"" if you will. She raised support by way of certainly 2 politically advantageous marriages, the third being a little more questionable. I personally don't think less of her for it, there are some that would argue that it does. Just an interesting thought to sort out. 

I always thought that the dynamic and struggle between the 2 queens was very interesting. In some letters I've read between them they talk of how in another life they could have been friends. The world could barely handle one independent queen. It couldn't handle two if Mary had just stayed in Scotland and was named as Elizabeth's heir. I think a lot of politicians feared this and sowed a lot of discord between the 2. 

As for nobility being a help or a hindrance I think it was captured pretty well. Who can help lift you up today may be your downfall tomorrow. It would be exhausting to live in such a cloud of paranoia. In my head that means that Elizabeth and Mary truly needed each other, two queens just trying to do what men said they couldn't do. Nobles and politics got in the way, maybe realizing an alliance between the two would be too strong to be allowed. At least, that's how I think about it sometimes in a romanticized version of history."

2) I do have some supplies purchased in case things get dicey. I have given into the anxiety to ""doomsday prep"" some; however Red Cross and other similar organizations do recommend having an emergency preparedness kit to some degree. Would it make you feel calmer to do that? 

Anxiety is hard without the 24 hour media cycle. It is a delicate balance of staying informed and not overconsuming and feeding the anxiety.

If you need to give in to the anxiety a little (prepping an emergency preparedness kit) or do some extra home disinfection (taking shoes off at the door, changing into home clothes) it's ok, but don't let it consume you. Find the balance. It's hard for a ""normal"", non anxious person; moreso for us. You've come this far which means you have some coping skills and awareness of your tendencies to spiral.

It makes me sad that you thought you were breaking the code and it hasn't panned out.

I don't have full on advice but maybe looking outside this group? I made a fairly good mom friend bc my son at 18 months old became OBSESSED with a boy in his class. I went to leave a note with boy's things and mom came to pick him up. Cue awkward introduction and exchange of numbers.

Mommit,fcnz5j7,t3_ei5ke9,1577821219.0,"I was never prepared for the emotions that came with weaning!!! So you have been alerted. No matter what method you choose someone will tell you that you should do it differently. You know you and your baby's relationship the best. You can do this.

Anyway, I had a total boob addict but when she was about 18 months old my period returned and I just couldn't. My sisters all swore by Farmer's Alamanac (FA) for weaning off bottles and pacifiers; I'm the only one who breastfed, so I figured why not? Though cold turkey was not for me. I had no one to help guide me bc it felt everyone else's breastfed babies self weaned.

Each month I dropped a feed with weaning dates according to FA. I started with the least important feeds first. (months prior I had night weaned her.)  I don't think that the dates themselves made it easier, however, it did give me a schedule to follow. 

July was when we started cutting back, November we were down to bedtime only. We kept going and I said I was going to let her pick when to drop the last feed. About her 2nd birthday in December I could feel myself drying up. It used to only be one boob could fill her, she now needed both at bedtime so I also started telling her that the milk was almost gone. I had my husband take some pictures bc I knew our nursing was coming to a close.

One night after nursing we had a very rough bedtime. She asked to nurse again but I was not about to open that can of worms so I simply said, ""No. Milkies are all gone."" I meant for the night. The next bedtime, she did not ask to nurse. It clicked that she thought I meant they were all gone for forever. I debated offering but figured if she really wanted to she would ask. She did not. When she didn't ask the following night I decided to commit. We were done. She actually did not ask until about a week later. It broke my heart when she asked and I had to tell her the milkies were all gone (I dried up fairly quickly). She just whimpered and buried her head into my arm pit and went to sleep. No tears or screaming. We were officially done.

I cried later, sad because she is my last baby and her brother never nursed so she was also my only nursing baby. But despite the long process and a lot of comments criticizing how I weaned I know it was right for us. Even though I pushed her, she picked the ending."

Has for about 9ish months. I'm not engaging in that power struggle. I flat out asked about 4 months ago when was she going to wear undies and not diapers, for shits and giggles really. ""When I am 3."" Okay. So since then I would mention it ""When you're 3 we will go get special undies! And special pull ups for night!"" She wants to do dance class ""When you're 3 and wear undies you get to go be a ballerina!"" She knows we are getting closer. She's mentioned not wearing diapers anymore when she's 3, she's even asked to wear undies and used the potty here and there. After a few hours she does ask for her diaper and because she isn't 3 yet I grab one and say ""and you're 3 it's undies during the day."" It may work for her, may not.
