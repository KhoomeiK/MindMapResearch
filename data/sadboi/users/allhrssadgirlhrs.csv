The second you'll start voicing any unfulfillment you feel in the relationship he will hit you with the ""oh but I told you I'm not great at relationships and you still stayed"" and twist it on you. He'll pretend that his ""upfront honestly"" is an excuse for leading you on. He just wants all the perks of a relationship without any real commitment or effort on his part. Already he's not bothering to have fun dates with you. The unreasonable reaction he has towards your male friends considering he doesn't want to date you is unfair. 
Also OP, I'm sorry but just because he treats you better than the previous relationships doesn't mean that he's treating you well or how you deserve to be treated."

But as much as he loves arguing, he loves me more. He understands that it distresses me and always keeps himself in check. We can have playful arguments but he respects and upholds my boundaries.

I understand that it's hard when you love someone but it's not that hard when they treat you so badly. If you have to keep asking whether to leave him and for validation in your feelings then yeah you need to leave and you needed to do it a year ago. 
This is such a toxic unhealthy relationship. You're stuck in a cycle of ""yeah he did that but he was sorry and he loves me"" that many victims of domestic violence tend to be in. He will keep doing it, especially if you keep letting him. Every time he does something fucked and you don't walk away, you're setting the new bar to how much he can get away with."

relationship_advice,f339gtg,t3_dfi7ck,1570634322.0,"When you love someone and you're this close to them sometimes it can be hard to distinguish where your love for that person begins and ends. I'm gonna assume that she's probably your favourite person in your life. I think maybe you're so used to having this amount of affection for someone you see romantically, that it's confusing you because mostly you see her platonically. As you said these feelings are only occasional.
I definitely had that myself. My best friend is a girl, we are as close as any two separate people can be. And while I'm very straight, I have had moments of confusion where I wondered if I was in love with her. Because honestly I have never had someone understand me, care for me, vibe with me more. But no, turns out we're just platonic soulmates.
It's like romantic relationships are idolised to the point where we unconsciously believe that the best relationship in our lives and someone we're that close with, is someone we surely must be in love with. But it's most likely just an overflow of friendly affection. It's honestly just something that you'll have to get used to and I don't think it's something you need to feel guilty about. Just continue being her friend and enjoy it."
