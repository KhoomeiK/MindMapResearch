for reference, ive had a history of substance abuse/ dependence, with weed, alcohol, painkillers (like percs or t3s), nicotine too i guess but i dont really consider that because it doesn't really give you a ""high"" more because vaping was fun lol. still got super addicted.

i also overall have a really addictive personality, so even with things such as self harm, or even music or people or shows, and even daydreaming, the moment it gives me some type of ""relief"" i guess i become hooked and its the only thing that can give me peace. im trying to learn to enjoy life as it is :)"

all i can suggest is maybe talking to them and trying to get them to understand just how much their comments affect you. you should feel welcomed, especially in your home.

BPD,fogh013,t3_g7culq,1587752464.0,"alcohol definitely breaks down that wall and persona you put up, and brings out anything in you. like when i drink it tends to bring forward everything ive been locking away, so i tend to be the stereotypical white girl always crying lol, but alcohol also makes my mood swings way more intense so thats not good. 

point it, i agree that alcohol doesn't always make you an asshole, like i tend to be super nice when im drunk always complimenting everyone, but if u have surpressed anger itll come out.

i dont really have any tips to be honest but i guess id start with acknowledging your emotions. i know me, and many others, drink to numb feelings so the best way to combat that is to understand your emotions. maybe try journaling or mindfulness and stuff. also distraction's, because while acknowledging them is important, you cant become too hung up on difficult emotions because youll end up back at the start. maybe try a hobby, for me i love cooking and baking, or listen to music or read. alcohol is dangerous, i mean its so easy to abuse it and it can go back easily. i dont know if this helps, but i hope it does a bit."
BPD,fobrpd3,t3_g6l7ip,1587662942.0,"when you wanna snack for emotional reasons, whether is be boredom or sadness or whatever, i feel like its important to recognize that and realize that once you eat, you will not feel satisfied.

 maybe try to conquer the boredom its self? trust me i know its so hard, especially during this pandemic, but what ive done is i tell myself ""ok do this thing first and then you can eat a snack"" so like maybe ill do yoga or ill clean up the kitchen counter, or if its a meal time, ill try to prepare myself a meal instead of just snacking until im ""full"" because once you do that small activity, while you still may want to snack, it may be diminished a bit.

also, the other comment said keeping a log, and i feel like this might actually be very helpful. when i snack for example, i often do it absent minded and i don't realize just how much i ate throughout the day, but will a log maybe itll help you space it out more because you can realize ""hey i just ate, so i must be bored again and not hungry"". also keeping a log may help you feel more organized and on top of things and motivate you more.

oh and one more thing ive been doing is small workouts right when i get up, which i know sounds insane haha but theyve actually helped, mainly because it increases your metabolism throughout the day, and so even with snacking it's not as detrimental i guess?

its taken me a while to start combatting the snacking, i started a couple days ago, and i understand if it may be overwhelming. its so much easier to stay in bed, but i believe you can do it!! start with little things and move up, and also don't be too hard on yourself if you do catch yourself slipping. i hope this helps :)"

its hard now and im sorry you had to go through this. panic attacks on weed are not talked about as often, even though they should be. it will get better i promise, i know you may think its all over, but its not. ive been through the same, and so have many people, you are not alone. just live day to day, you will get through this."

""theres something ABNORMAL about you, no one acts this way, i meam youre just a TERRIBLE person""

and so im like ""what??? like just please leave me alone i dont want to talk to anyone right now""

""oh of course its all about what YOU want! no ones going to want to be with you of act like this. i mean we're sticking out because you're our daughter so we have to, but OTHER PEOPLE? no ones putting up with you""

and im like? ok i know its been a tough day, and im sorry but WHAT?? like they know about my bpd and in a way theyve just almost been using it in a way against (not exactly in this situation, but others). they always say things like you cant be so selfish, youre ruining everyones day, etc.
