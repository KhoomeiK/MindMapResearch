SuicideWatch,fpm8nas,t3_ge4tw1,1588727811.0,This is so true. I don't hate money but I hate the concept of it. How it divides us. Money has ended the barter system and has made exchange so much easier. But that came with a cost. Greed took over. Capitalism happened. The evil ones in the top control 98% of the wealth. The remaining are left fighting for that 3%. I hope the world gets better one day. Where love prevails. Where borders don't separate us. Where money does not define us. Why can't we live as one?
Reincarnation,fpm5qsn,t3_ge11cm,1588726121.0,"There is no concrete evidence yet but I find it to make alot of sense. Think about the concepts of karma. It is a reality. Every action has a result and everything seems to be linked to something. I think of life like a puzzle. There will come a day when you realize all the dots connect. In the concept of reincarnation, the life we are living now will determine what our next life will be. Our actions. However I find a lot of suffering in the world we live and don't want to believe in it but it still makes a lot of sense."

antiwork,fpevyuw,t3_gcl02z,1588556131.0,Steve Cutts does nothing but create masterpieces. Check his Instagram. I love the illustration that shows an evil looking man selling sanitizers. It has a deep meaning.
antiwork,fpevifi,t3_gcn8ua,1588555845.0,Schools are more like factories that generate obedient slaves for different companies. Ok that's dark.
antiwork,fpev820,t3_gcvcxb,1588555663.0,"It is doing what we love for a living. That makes it passion and not ""work"". Working for a corrupt boss for 8 hours a day doing something you find no meaning is definitely ""work""."

LaCasaDePapel,fn1cuc9,t1_fn0cbwb,1586559375.0,">The problem is, isn't this common knowledge? Why did Gandia need to be told this?

Because Gandhia is an assassin with a little autism. ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ The writers messed up with that part."
LaCasaDePapel,fn1bxfr,t1_fn1bfp4,1586558851.0,"Yes. Tokyo is the worst. 
However, the professor knows the nature of Gandhia and that he won't cooperate. We see that in season 4. It is stupid to believe that Gandhia would cooperate. The writers did some mistakes is what I believe."

He looked like how I wanted to look. He was like Tyler Durden in fight club. I was the narrator. I stopped posting on Facebook way before quitting. I also don't like the reactions feature. No matter how nice your pics and quotes were, there will always be someone laugh reacting. The memes became annoying. It has become a place where people I hate waste their pointless lives sharing memes. All my fake highschool friends use it. I decided not to. Most of my bad relationships happened through Facebook.. The remaining from school."

misanthropy,fmxy6sk,t3_fxz5qg,1586474217.0,"I am 30 and school is still my worst memories. Getting bullied in school can really affect your future.  Education is one of the most important things in life. However the school system of today is outdated. Some schools are getting better but still the majority remains the same. 
It is like a factory that creates workers. Instead of a quality education, they shove some bullshit into our heads which we won't give a single fuck later on in life. The mental damage done in school (bullying) continues as well. 
Those that get good grades will serve well in the workforce for the rest of their lives. Many lose their souls working jobs they hate and getting into debt. 
Freedom of thinking is restricted in schools. Even if the answer is correct, you won't pass if it does not meet the ""standards"". We see many legends who made it in real life were dropouts. They decided to educate themselves. Not by the factory which we call school."
Reincarnation,fmxwafi,t3_fxs965,1586473137.0,Very nice. Something come to my mind after watching this. Do we choose our next lives. Or is it determined by karma?
GooglePixel,fmwpwnl,t1_fmwbwqz,1586450937.0,True. The OnePlus 7t has a much larger display but its still 1080p. I saw it and it still looks great.
GooglePixel,fmwaaho,t1_fmo8tfm,1586442799.0,How is the display? People are complaining because it has a 1080p panel. I am planning to buy one.
AskPhotography,fmrunpm,t1_fmra05y,1586336098.0,Thanks. Can you recommend a mirrorless camera for someone who is just getting started? I am currently planning to buy a mid range DSLR like the Nikon D7500.

LaCasaDePapel,fmoe8oe,t1_fmkjcef,1586255788.0,He will when the writers want it. Not with an assault rifle. But a small pistol. Who knows he could even trip and fall. Thats how they did Nairobi. She manages to survive a bullet to the chest and suddenly the writers were like ah she can't work for us anymore so lets just kill her. All that recovery and surgery from Tokyo who suddenly became a professional surgeon went to nothing.
LaCasaDePapel,fmmsadj,t3_fw7a8i,1586211109.0,I hoped that gandhia would join the team. The part where he said that he won't kneel even towards God was chilling.
smallbusiness,fmmbacr,t1_fmma6l4,1586202189.0,">I would get your uncle and the friend together to try and work something out and put it in writing.

This is exactly what I am trying to do. I hope it worksâ€‹ out. Too much effort was put into making this garage and I don't want it to go to waste. Selling the place is not something my uncle is willing to do."
smallbusiness,fmm8bzw,t1_fmm5mjr,1586200663.0,I want the garage to start running. I won't be able to run the garage the way I want because it does not fully belong to my uncle. My uncle is out of town and he is the one that pays the bills and rent. I personally don't know my uncle's friend and any of these people associated with him. I also don't understand the motives behind my uncle's friend wanting to buy the garage from him.
Xiaomi,fmjgu45,t1_fmjfkad,1586130043.0,I use an app called Phonograph. Its my favorite music player. A third party eq app works for me. Hope the next update fixes these issues. I had to switch to a second device due to the low volume. Yes its Bluetooth. The volume is fine on wired earbuds.
Xiaomi,fmje5hv,t1_fmi6st2,1586128497.0,One thing I noticed after I updated to Android 10 is that the equilizer is gone. Also the volume is noticably lower on my airpods. Did you try any wireless earbuds with your device?

LaCasaDePapel,fmekaev,t3_fudbpv,1586006561.0,He is my new favorite. I think he is among the few people that can handle Gandhia.
LaCasaDePapel,fme65le,t1_fmdy42a,1585990985.0,Imagine if Gandhia was part of the heist. He would be unstoppable.
LaCasaDePapel,fmd2q05,t1_fmcblye,1585958016.0,I am myself quite disappointed with this season. I think they ran out of ideas this time. Lisbon's court scene was quite unrealistic.
LaCasaDePapel,fmd2gq2,t1_fmbbd6t,1585957857.0,Honestly hated her even more this season
LaCasaDePapel,fmd24sz,t3_fu0xdg,1585957654.0,Hated the fact that Rio and Tokyo are together again. Tokyo could still end up fucking up the heist even more.
photography,fm2e266,t1_fm2dn2v,1585695624.0,I have read that Nikon won't be continuing their entry level dslr series. So I guess there won't be a d3600 or a d5700. :(
photography,fm2blzt,t3_fror4d,1585694241.0,Is there any possibility of Nikon continuing the D3000 series? I love and still use the D3400 as one of my main bodies. Its small and lightweight. It can support all the beautiful Nikon F glass. Its also cheap and I am pretty disappointed that Nikon discontinued the D3000 and D5000 series. Many new photographers that are just beginning can't afford high end bodies and mirrorless cameras.
