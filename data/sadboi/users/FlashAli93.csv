mentalhealth,fjds5gl,t3_fcx9xc,1583258192.0,Go for a scream... I hike up to an old mining area and just have a good a scream. Or into a pillow if you can't get out. Bottling things up doesn't help. We are all here if you need advice or a chat xx
mentalhealth,fiyuenl,t3_fal5f6,1582847182.0,"See a doctor, mental health is very important and you should take time to get a proper diagnosis. You are also young and probably just finding you feet in life and this too can be very overwhelming. Online tests are BS."

relationship_advice,fi6rrp1,t3_f6pcyo,1582205698.0,"I have done this!
Then (16f) met my ""boyfriend"" (18m) while we were at school. The whole fell in love child sweet heart BS that you think it's going to be forever. Things turned sour around the year make and we called it quits at 14 months. The breakup was difficult, we both did alot of stuff that we don't regret per say but was not the norm. I struggled alot with mental health issues and I made contact as ""just friends"" I still loved him but I denied it. We met up for coffee and everything clicked into place for us. We had grown up, had experiences. We got married in March 13 and now have a 3yo. We needed the break. Absence make the heart grow fonder.

I would just be careful. Don't jump straight in the deep end."
