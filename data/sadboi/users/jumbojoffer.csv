AskReddit,fbx3yij,t3_eetf7i,1577168381.0,"My sister had a guest over and they were chilling in her room. Attention-sick me wanted to be a part of what they were doing, so I placed my feet against the door and back against the opposing wall and pushed as hard as I could. Broke the hinges on the door, but never got in all the way. Went on to do other things right after because I got bored of being bored.

On a separate previous occasion, my sister was in her room talking to a friend over skype or some equivalent. A webcam was present, and I'm sure she was on video call. Young, ignorant me who didn't know anything about such things went naked into her room and smeared my dick all over the webcam while laughing like a maniac. The story has been told, now we can pretend I never said anything.

depression,f7wj624,t3_dxp0co,1574033835.0,"I may not have been as deep into the waters as many others in this subreddit, but I'd like to add in my own nickels.

I felt like doing nothing, and whenever I did something, it felt like a waste and it didn't matter. Not for me, not for my family, not for my friends, and not for society. I would spend hours upon hours mindlessly browsing the web without any purpose, just to pass time while also thinking about myself and my situation. I had talked to my doctor, my school's main counselor and psychotherapists. The latter one showing slight improvement, but not enough to change my sad face into a satisfied one.

Later on I found a couple videos on youtube from Dr. Jordan Peterson, a psychology professor with so much knowledge on the subject that I could barily keep up. Everything he had to say during his talks and lectures hit home to me, and it made perfect sense to me (still does to highest degree). After I found him, I went on a crusade of self-discovery, and my mental health seemed to only go towards the positive from here, and I began finding meaning to life... A cause to fight for... a purpose. This is when i realized that I'm not obligated to anything. My only 1 task in life, is to experience it, no matter what kind of experience that will be. During my crusade in finding myself, I looked at every possibility, even illegalities, although that path isn't for everyone, and shouldn't be the first thing to jump to. A lot of thinking, planning and weighing pros and cons went into making the decision to take my specific route.

It's been maybe 4 months since I ever had a glimpse of depression, and I fail to see how it could return... unless there is a very specific reason, such as the death of a loved one. I think that would be a different issue, and not ""depression"" as is. The fact that I can't see how I'd fall back into depression is evidence enough for me that my mental health is now where it needs to be... Or at least WAY better than before.

My advice would be to listen to Dr. Jordan Peterson. It may not help, but he has a lot of intelligent discussions and lectures that may give you the spark needed to get a hold of what's holding you back. Of course, the first advice would be to talk to a psychotherapist about your issue(s), or to anyone around you for that matter, but listening to Jordan for a bit could be a neat addition. He covers a wide range of topics, and his main thing is ""responsibility"" if I'm not mistaken. It might be worth a shot at least.

If anyone has anything to add to what I've said, please do. I'd be interested in hearing what people think of this.

LSD,f599v1f,t1_f573j68,1572078570.0,"I thought this was a much more common approach. I always do this with questionable topics.

I did this myself when I talked about weed with my dad in relation to my grandpa possibly having parkinsons. PS: weed is very illegal here.  
What I said was along the lines of ""marijuana seems to work for many parkinsons patients. If he actually has parkinsons, then this could be one way to help him."" And then I showed him a youtube video.

You take that objective stance, and people see that right away and will stick to the subject rather than think about where YOU are in the subject.

Doing this works well for convincing others, as it's when you put yourself into the conversation that they doubt you and poke random holes in your research where those holes don't even make sense/belong. ""It works. I've tried it like many others, and it's good"" will raise a lot more questions than if you said ""I've read about people trying this, and it worked for many of them""."

""Why do I bully myself like this? Why am I hurting myself? By hurting myself, I hurt my family and friends. Why do I hurt them? They did nothing to deserve that. I did nothing to deserve that.  
Nobody could ever be as mean to me, as I've been to myself. I don't want this... I am done!""

Had a 2 month afterglow after that. I was the happiest man on earth, and my depression seems to have disappeared completely since then.  
I don't have an afterglow anymore, but the depression hasn't returned (yet atleast). It's been about 3 or 4 months that trip."

LSD,ewezo4f,t1_ewd3rqy,1565345261.0,"Oooh, the simulations.

At certain points, I felt like I ""escaped"" the simulation, only to ""wake up"" in a new one, one layer above.
I remember losing hope of ever getting out and feeling like I completely lost my mind, and eventually I ""thought"" myself a simulation that I wanted to stay in, being this reality we all know and share.
So if I was to believe in all the simulation stuff, then I'm still in it, and LSD helps you get a jump start on your journey to the top-most simulation... If THAT could even exist.

I see failure as a win, since you usually learn the most from failing or getting challenged.

When I tried acid for the first time, I started crying because I came to the realization that I've been terribly mean to myself, and that nobody could hurt me as much as I've been hurting myself. I've dealt with depression for longer than I can remember, almost every single day, but after this trip my life flipped around. I was full of life and happiness for 2 months, then went ""neutral""...
