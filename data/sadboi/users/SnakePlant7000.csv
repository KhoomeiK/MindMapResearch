I also would have nothing for her, no words, no emotions, no attention, until she is ready to reconcile with me.

I would say that a more important focus is what does your fiance think and how is he responding to his mother?

Perhaps your fiance could speak with her and set a boundary and her needing to manage herself and her challenges. Maybe you could even participate in that conversation.

You all have had 10 years together to form appropriate boundaries but as you move into marriage and a new level of commitment, expectations might change and those boundaries might need to be re-defined.

Take it from a person who is still fighting that battle,  you do not want to start your marriage with your MILs needs as a pirmary focus. You'll end up unhappy and wasting a lot of time.

Even if she says yes now, there's stil going to be a point in your relationship when those 3 years makes a difference and causes some kind of insecurities or makes one of both of you question things.  

Spend some time examining why you never wanted to make it official before, so you have some insight.

Also, not every person would put up with being a FWB with someone for 3 years when that person says no to more when they ask for more.  It's tough to truly respect a person that sticks around and settles for less than what they want for so long.

You loved and do love your child regardless of what she says or does. Your child means more than a headstone. You can avoid reducing her to that.

Moving forward, just try to think about what is best for you and your children and your partner. That's most important. She is an adult and has to live with her own choices.

BipolarSOs,f9su58d,t1_f9ssnc2,1575600614.0,"You're right! So right!

And no one gets it unless they live it. It's incredibly isolating the same way an abusive relationship is. And in many ways it is abusive because they take so much and give so little.

And theres no groups for it in our area.

This subreddit is what has kept me feeling connected and reduced that feeling of isolation. Connecting with people here has helped me to jumpstart my own selfcare."
BipolarSOs,f9ssa9e,t3_e6q45b,1575599347.0,"This sounds eerily similar to my life. I still don't know what to do.

We tried couples counseling but after 2 years of no results from her i finally did my own research amd realized his disorder is a huge issue. I brought it up and the therapist basically said she had forgotten about it all that time. I haven't founf another one suitable enough for our situation. I think it made it worse actually because it empowered him and made me look unsupportive for not going along with his shortcomings and concerning behavior.

I say all that to say be very cautious."
relationship_advice,f97w69b,t3_e3zfre,1575171020.0,"The best part about your post is that you are taking responsibility for yoursef and your own contributions to breakdowns in the relationships you have.  That's a HUGE step int he right direction and puts you way ahead many others in your situation.

This sounds like you may have some underlying abandonment needs.  The key for me is your response to being hurt or worrying that it will fail causes you to act out.  There's different types of abandonment disorders.  A therapist would be really helpful.  If that's not what you want to do, you could explore imago theory online.  The Harville Hendrix book, ""Getting the Love You Want"" and the accompanying workbook might be a good place to start to get to know yourself better.

Best of luck!"

Where is the line? Telling little lies makes it easier to tell big ones.


But. I do agree this could be a communication problem. That is irrittating.

The other thing it it sounds you are learning more about ""take me as i am."" People are imperfect. It's easy to take what you like about them. It's the things you hate that are either deal breakers or things you have to learn to accept or things you chose to continue letting it drive you crazy.

Soooooo not easy.

Your choice entirely.

But not always easy."

Thank you"
BipolarSOs,f7oh32s,t1_f7o987l,1573927333.0,"Thank you.  
Im considering going back to a therapist. I did before for my own trauma. It was helpful. For this though i feek like the bottom line is stay or leave and the conclusion would be leave but im not ready to so i dont go to hear what i already know.
I do think i need to withdraw from him a bit though. Disengage a bit to save myself.
Its justbsad."
BipolarSOs,f7ogl9c,t1_f7obmb6,1573927095.0,Ive told him before i think he should go somewhere. He has A LOT of trauma. His mom was a raging alcoholic who would lock he and his sister in the bathroom when they annoyed her. Ive told him i think he will be better off long term if he just takes a couple of months to get himself together. His parents can certainly afford it
BipolarSOs,f7o90q0,t1_f7o477d,1573923222.0,"i def feel i cant handle caring for myself and him. esp if he doesnt fully commit to caring for himself. ive been cooking today which is excellent for me and will be going hiking today too. 

they get sucked into video games, because they need that stimulation.  it often becomes an addiction for them.

i dont think he accepts his diagnosis. we have read the symptoms on a website together and he still says he disagrees with those symptoms. im like ""honey its the DSM its what it is whether you accept it or not"""
BipolarSOs,f7o8opm,t1_f7nvtcd,1573923013.0,"we arent. i dont speak to his family generally. i havent seen them in a year because they have a problem with my race, which he doesnt see and is an entirely other issue.  i was concerned enough that i called his father on thursday. he stayed with his dad last night so i handed him off to his actual parent i guess."
relationship_advice,f6sy8fi,t3_dsvhqv,1573141410.0,"Well, now you know.
So what are you going to do next?
Sometimes people change and grow and evolve.  Look at Kim and Kanye. He encouraged her to pose nude after their first child and now he doesnt want her to wear a corset, but she still want to do all of those things.
That is something that may never change. Can you deal with the father of your children exerting that kind of control over your children?
If yes, then keep going as you have.
If no, then you have some choices to make."

And by the way, yes, your inlaws are controlling your marriage and conception of your child and your wife appears to be fine with it. That should be a significant concern that is addressed pre.child.  i would wonder if they are driving your wife to require you to use different sperm. They have already shown they are fine with ultimatums so why not a second time."

That's what happened to me. I was clueless, depressed thinking things were all my fault until I got connected to this sub and saw that sooooooo many of his behaviors were BP related.
I have found that asking my partner to stop for a second and pause and then i repeat back to him what he says or has done. I ask him to explain how that will help him get to his long term goals. That creates glimmers of clarity."

Consider purple tea too. Lots of antioxidants, not a ton of caffeine. Increase your vitamin a intake. Consider taking tumeric capsules."
