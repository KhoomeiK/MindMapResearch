reddevils,eogtwai,t1_eogrx1f,1558565630.0,I‚Äôd be fine with the text too. The logo is obnoxious and doesn‚Äôt even fit with United.
reddevils,eogtpxt,t1_eogqjc4,1558565508.0,Because non-footy people think I‚Äôm a redneck hick who likes NASCAR and Silverados. The logo is obnoxious. I Cannot stand explaining to people I don‚Äôt care about Chevys nor do I drive one.

reddevils,eo8y75q,t1_eo8ecrr,1558377561.0,"Your assessment of Rashy is spot on. I‚Äôm so tired of the criticism. People think because he isn‚Äôt at Mbappe level now, than he is another Welbeck. Everyone only thinks in Black and White terms. 

But also, I can only imagine how good Rashford would be if he was in PSG‚Äôs squad making those forward runs. He would be electric. 

As his form dipped so did everyone else‚Äôs. It felt like he was playing injured a lot, and was also taking in too much responsibility in trying to be the savior when other players‚Äô form also dipped. 

People are tired of his dipping free kicks that go over. But obviously he must be nailing those in training because the teammates always allow him to take it. They‚Äôve obviously seen him bury them in training and if he keeps getting the chances, there‚Äôs only a matter of time before they start going in. He‚Äôs 21. He isn‚Äôt the answer for another RVP or Ronaldo right now, but he does have the skills to play here."
reddevils,eo8oizt,t1_eo7vbwl,1558371367.0,I agree. I think people forget or don‚Äôt realize how many chances Man City and Liverpool create for their strikers. Many slated Lukaku‚Äôs misses at Arsenal because he had like 3 clear chances in front of goal. But sterling usually gets like 10 a game and he‚Äôll score 1 or 2 easy.
LosAngeles,eo64gdy,t3_bqjjt2,1558311209.0,I love this haha.
