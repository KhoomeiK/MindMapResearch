>Although I understand your rationale behind this it is difficult to abstract client apps (front end) from the back end and keep it maintainable in the long run. Even Microsoft tried and failed (ASP.NET Web Forms, if you ever needed to maintain an old app made with this you would see the problems)

The difference between asp web forms and the way this framework builds views is you still have complete control of every single element, and can even declare individual classes and styles for each. 

>The problem is that it is very difficult to abstract all the nuances of the front end stack between browsers and have performance and a modern look and feel at the same time. The front end also evolves rapidly, like the back end, and you have to keep up with it.

That's why I'm using bootstrap. I don't see bootstrap going away any time soon, and it solves the issues of cross browser compatibility quite well. 

> Another story is serving the front end. Modern JavaScript Frameworks build the whole app into a few optimised resources. The default is an SPA in which basically the client's browser runs the front end. It's a huge offload of server resources and makes everything way more snappier.

Well to be fair, adept frontend devs would never touch this. This is more for backend guys who want to build a small project or just have some fun. I don't see this ever getting to the point of being viable for enterprise level stuff. Also, SPA's are trash in my opinion. You could even use this to build a PWA (a goal of mine for the future) using some simple service workers. 

> But as PHP moves forward there is a place for solutions like yours if we would need native cross platform UI for desktop and mobile devices. It's nice to push the boundaries.

Thank you. I know this framework isn't anything like your typical MVC framework. I think that's what intrigues me about the concept.

The idea is to have everything for your app in one code base, using one language. I don't know about you, but I'm quite tired of jumping from language to language and file to file all the time.

Laravel is my favorite framework but everything is so fragmented in terms of where things live. You got your controllers, models, routes, views, observers, middleware, and on and on. And even after all of that, you still have to deal with more frontend stacks. 

There is a problem this framework is trying to solve. Writing HTML and CSS sucks for backend guys like me."

As for Valet and Laragon - it configures and installs browserSync for you, so you get that real-time browser refreshing while working on your app. The browserSync is configured to work with Valet and Laragon quite well out of the box via the proxy setting I assign to it upon installation of the package.

Look at the `InstallsCrudify` class for more details.
