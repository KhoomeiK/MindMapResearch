Second of all, YOU CLEARLY DIDNT READ THE LINK I SENT YOU. SO CLEARLY YOU DONT KNOW ENOUGH TO EVEN COMMENT BACK. (No anger there, just want to make sure you read that part incase you skim this) Get angry all you want. I only feel bad for you and wish to help.

And what makes me special? Nothing. I am no more or less special than anyone else. 

Also, I've met god during cardiac arrest. It's quite different than you would expect, and was far more beautiful than imaginable. It left me with more questions than answers furthermore proving no one has him completly understood. I know that my experience itself was real, and can then read other peoples NDEs and learn from theres too. Considering I've read between 250-500 reports to understand my experience more, I've learned alot.

Read it. You will feel better.

god,fk305rw,t3_ff4c7w,1583813628.0,"Most of the future is not set in stone. God can see every way possible that a situation can go, but not the one that will happen when it comes down to it. All the biggest obstacles in our life are set in stone but not most of the other things. It's up to us to decide what to do. Ultimately, your life is what you make it. If you say it's pointless it will become pointless (only for you). The purpose of life is to Learn, and to Love. That's pretty much it. Your soul chose to come to Earth. You may not be able to see it right now but after death you will understand.. 

How do I know this? I've experienced what happens after death 3 times. And I've spent a large amount of time reading other people's near death experiences to make sense of my own. If you truly want to learn about god and the purpose of life, go to near-death.com its run by IANDS (International Near Death Study). It is non-profit and not biased to any religion. You will learn about god there far more than anywhere else. It will change the way you see life. What's actually true reality will blow your mind. Message me if you wanna read my experience. I'm telling ya tho, go read some experiences there. Your whole outlook on life will change for the better.

B.T.W, there is no Hell. If there were I would've gone there. There is a temporary purgatory type state you can go to but only extremly hateful people go there. It isnt for torture or punishment, it's because people avoid going into the White Light (yes its real) out of shame and guilt. God would absolutly never burn us for eternity. What does that say about his unconditional love if it were true? The idea of hell came up through misinterpretation of translating the bible. The word Hell really means a place called Gehenna. They burned trash and bodies there (on earth). Read all the bible verses about hell and swap it out with Gehenna. It paints an entirely different picture."
god,fk2v1vq,t3_ffxisp,1583809855.0,"I've been in cardiac arrest 3 times so I know abit about this. God is everything. His essense is love. Theres no doubt about that. I felt it. Love manifests in many ways. Being kind, caring, compassionate, helpful are all forms of love. Any religion that is based on the many forms of love is based on god. There is not one true religion. Pretty much all of them have somethings correct. Allah means god in Arabic. All religions pray to the same god. They just have different ideas of what he is and what he wants. 

Pick one that suits you best. The best place to learn about god is through near death experiences. There will be peoples acounts of meeting god. You will learn more about life and god at near-death.com. my experience is posted there so I can confirm with absolute certainty that 95%+ of the experiences are true. There are many different sections there such as Scientifc evidence and experiences of different kinds of people. Theres even an experience of 3 different people of 3 different religions having the same NDE together. God told them they need to help unite all religions. God is love and connection."

StopSpeeding,f9juxpn,t3_e54v77,1575386385.0,"If your addicted to it, you will never be able to go back to your prescribed dose and stay there. Not only will it be ineffective, you will be bound to abuse it all over again. Dont rationalize that u can control it cuz u wont be able to.  I'd suggest getting off it completly and going to rehab. At this point you definatly need it. And if you think you dont have the time for rehab bc of work or family, then your putting things before your recovery and wont stay sober anyway. After abusing my adderall I could never go back down to my prescribed dose of 60mg. Then I started using IV Meth. I went to treatment and am 45 days sober and feel great and no need for stims.
Best wishes-Cj"

Switch,f9hqf55,t1_f9gzbot,1575319711.0,I was interested and still am. The game just feels very empty. Theres barely any main quests and all the side quests are fetch quests.

god,f9e12mf,t3_e47flz,1575238680.0,You can find more about the truth of god by researching Near Death Experiences than most places. Whole lot of evidence supporting it. Go to Near-death.com that's where my spirituality took off.

benzodiazepines,f8taik1,t1_f8t9jqy,1574799323.0,I've heard of people popping for .25mgs of clam so It can happen. Depends on the test and if the lab that made it made pure clam or if it is dirtied but other benzos. Also I dont know anyone who takes minuscule doses of clam. Your more likely to drink the whole bottle bc of the compulsive redosing and delusions of sobriety. Drug tests have gotten hip to RC benzos. If your getting drug tested stay away from benzos. It's just not a good idea and one you probably will regret
god,f8svuf9,t3_e1vuuo,1574790258.0,Yes I am
