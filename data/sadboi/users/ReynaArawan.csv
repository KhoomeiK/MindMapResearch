What happened to the Moors was, After they won the war (1492), they forced all Muslims to convert to Christianity (1502) despite the terms of surrender being that they would not make them convert and for a hundred years more they persecuted them in many of the ways they did during the racism of colonization, even those who converted to Christianity were taxed as though they weren't real Christians. During that time people were being burned for Witchcraft if they were pagan aswell. Or just women who weren't subservient enough. And in 1609 King Philip III rounded them up much like ICE and deported them right as they set off for expansion. Probably expelled them by ship or forced them into slavery in one of the areas they turned into countries and imperialized/colonized. No one seems to write clearly on the specifics of what happened to the expelled from what I can find. They likely killed by hanging anyone who refused to leave. Probably some Spanish citizens lynched more than a few. The historians say this expulsion was based on Islamic persecution, but I think we know they forced dark skinned people and African looking people to leave. It may have helped to fuel their hatred."

The only mutation in their DNA in terms of skin color is the one that allows them to absorb more vitamin D from the sun (which is because of the lack of Vitamin D in their diet, not because of the lack of sun), but that is not the only gene they have that determines skin color. There are hundreds of genes that would determine melanin expression. Plus more often than not, when a black or brown person has a child with a white person, the child is highly melanated."

Also all blue eyed people share a common ancestor who lived between 6000 and 10 000 years ago.

hapas,f6yui9l,t3_dtl0rp,1573298277.0,"Why is he working in China if he hates Chinese people so much? Someone better rescue his son.

And the reason white people are 100% white instead of having a wide variety of skin tone in their population and have huge bumpy noses is because of inbreeding.

There is no reason the European population would have zero melanated people in their population if they hadn't been inbreeding. I KNOW they had dark skinned europeans 10 000 years ago because the one and only mummy they managed to dig up in England from that time period was dark skinned (google Cheddar Man ). And judging by Ancient Greek Art, there were still dark skinned Europeans far North-West as Greece 3000 years ago but Greeks don't get as dark as their ancestors depicted anymore.  Therefore I think white people look like that because of intentional inbreeding and colorism at a time they did not understand genetics. Their terrible racial science practices and tendency to dominate black and brown populations didn't come from nowhere. It came from 10 000 years of intentionally trying to breed out their melanin. And if they're going to claim it was natural evolution that turned their skin white they need to explain why indigenous Canadians still have a range of dark and light skinned people in their population even having been in cold climates since the Ice Age.

The proximity of Europe to Africa alone should encourage more race mixing. And the efficiency and the thorough expulsion  of the Moors frome Spain makes me think they've done shit like that before.(Maybe indigenous  Americans can do the same to them). There should be a large population who are descendants from the moorish civilians but all there are is white passing people in Spain. Only evidence  is that some Spanish people can get a tan now even though it wasn't that long ago.

And if it were true that ethical production impacts the energy, our phones, computers and everything we own should carry a negative vibration too. Not only is that the exact reason miners are looking for materials underground but they are made with inhumane labor conditions.

As for everything else we consume and purchase, it is all born out of capitalism and imperialism and thus unethical. Most countries have desecrated and stolen sacred indigenous land to sustain the capitalist system. It would have failed a long time ago without the oppression of people, animals and the planet. That's why America is so dependent on the free labor of prisoners.

If you weren't able to revive the positive vibrations in objects, all humans in the western world, except for indigenous, should be experiencing an all time low frequency.

I don't really feel guilt as a consumer. The system of capitalism cannot be controlled by the consumer. It is human nature to use what is in your immediate environment to survive (which, in my opinion, includes cultural purchases because that is a part of human mental health). 

The government has the capability to control corporations, but they won't. Most leaders will be impeached or assassinated if they propose anything that in the slightest resembles socialism or communism. In my opinion, the first world civilizations have to collapse in order for both our planet and species to regain equilibrium. Otherwise, one or both will become extinct. No more North America, no more China, no more Korea no more Europe. Of course there is no guarantee imperialism will not be attempted by someone else once the borders are taken down so I think left wing facism is probably the only was I can think of.

This dimension completely depends on consuming the supposedly lesser vessels of other spirits which is supposedly more of me.

I don't know the point in the experience of a hierarchical system and I don't see why we aren't taught to remember from a young age.

3. Meditation while letting fearfull, sad, shameful or angry negative thoughts come to the surface so you can deal with them.

I usually see a lot of visuals in the indigo light that is in my 3rd eye before falling asleep after doing these things.

And I'm still pretty mad at Blackwall for impersonating a Grey Warden. Probably because I was THE warden and that fucker doesn't even know what a warden really is. I'll never forgive him. Offended foreverrrr!"
AstralProjection,exgx2ir,t3_cs7a5b,1566279327.0,"That had to have been a thing before the Navy Seals even existed. Lots of cultures consider breath a spiritual thing. 

There's also something called shamanic breathing which shaman would have used to get into trance states. Except shamans do it fast enough for like 30 minutes straight to get so much oxygen in their blood that you feel tingling and induce a psychadelic state and visions."
AstralProjection,exfldck,t3_cryq6b,1566243087.0,"If you want something too bad or you are too needy about it,  your subconscious tends to resist you.  This happens a lot in the spirit realm and especially if you encounter your higher self while on psychadelics. 

I'm not saying you should go find drugs but shrooms and ayahuasca has been known to help people out of a depression cycle. Especially microdosing shrooms. It sounds like you need to destroy your ego. Do what you think best and always be safe."
dragonage,excho0v,t3_crtth9,1566150968.0,I liked DA:2 A lot too. I still haven't finished DA:I. Doing that right now but it's because I feel like it's more time consuming. Plus I really don't like the idea of leading an inquisition. Makes me a colonizer on behalf of a religion I don't like rather than a hero. I do miss being a Grey Warden though because it is such a tragic sacrifice. My favorite ending was where I died. I cried so hard. It was pathetic. Lol
AstralProjection,ex4hdgo,t3_cr72f8,1566004835.0,"The couple times I have done it, I'm pretty sure it will happen when I've spent a little bit of time relaxing while watching visuals happen in my third eye when I'm in a hypnogogic state and then eventually I hear a really weird energy-like sound and I'll feel a little tingling all over for a couple seconds while I separate then  I'll feel like I'm in another lighter-weight body just as that sound happens. Then I'll know I can just roll out or float out. 

It's hard for me to get the hypnogogic state on purpose though.
And wanting to AP too bad can cause stress so put the intention in your mind without being too needy about it. Just keep a sense of trust that it will happen even if it doesn't happen right now, it will eventually."
AstralProjection,ewy1u9u,t1_ewvazw8,1565872975.0,"Try a piece of quartz or something. They emit certain vibrations or frequencies and you can also use them to amplify the vibrations you choose. They use them in watches to regulate the piezoelectric system so we know the frequency they emit is real even in science. Meaning, if you squeeze, vibrate (with electricity from the battery in a Quartz watch), or cause friction to quartz it generates a little bit of energy. Same goes when you send your body's vibrations into it. After all, all atoms are vibrating. 

For me it takes about 20 minutes laying down with a bunch lined up on my body to feel a significant reduction of anxiety, but they work for a short while.

Except for moldavite. That stone is crazy intense and the effects are pretty much immediate for me.

Lots of fakes on the market so try and do a bit of research before buying."
AstralProjection,ewxz1t4,t1_ewwolzq,1565871463.0,I bought eight 1-2cm pieces at about $6 each from Amazon.ca a couple of years ago and they were real. The vibrations are so obvious I never suspected they were fakes. Plus they came with certification. My head was buzzing for days when I first got them because I sleep in the same room with them. And I think the range of effects has to be 5-10 feet. I felt the vibrations through the door right before they were delivered to me. If the postal worker is sensitive at all he probably thought he was having a really weird but not painful migraine. Just a heavy buzzing feeling in your head and chest.
AstralProjection,ewkvv94,t3_con9an,1565496220.0,"You ever watch Ryan Cropper YouTube videos? He teaches people how to do it and he talks about his experiences a lot. He also has a lot of testimonies from his students/viewers. 

Also, if you talk to or listen to Shamans, hardcore Yogis from India, and hardcore Buddhists (kind of like the guy nicknamed Buddah Boy) ever, they will be able to talk to you about some experiences. It's a very well known part of meditation  practice to eventually astral project and it is also a big part of what yogis indigenous shamans and witches do in order to manifest. When indigenous people speak about shapeshifting into animals and vision quests, they are usually talking about the astral realm.

In the book Autobiography of a Yogi (the only book Steve Jobs had downloaded on his iPad), Paramahansa Yogananda explains many astral projection experiences where he spoke to many gurus on the astral plain.

If you try psychadelics like ayahuasca (DMT) or LSD, these are drugs that can force you to astral project. Psychonauts believe their experiences and visions are real because they can independently corroborate what they experience with everyone else who takes these substances. When you astral project without drugs, you are using the DMT that is already present in your body and is arguably produced by the pineal gland."

magick,eucpkkk,t3_cfnu1o,1563682257.0,"Face to face, the only way is to do DMT or learn to astral project which is just using the DMT produced by your own body. 
(You need to be careful with large doses of DMT from plants and make sure you do it with the intention to heal and learn new things, make sure you trust the DMT spirits and don't let your ego control the experience. Any fear or resistance can lead to a traumatizing experience.)
Eventually, with much experience with astral projection, you could develop extra sensory perceptions and communicate with spirits any time.

Otherwise, you can use divination which is more likely to be successful if you visit a place with lots of energy and portals. You can visit a cemetery or famously haunted areas frequently and invite spirits to talk to you, but I recommend giving offerings if you do that. Eventually you will attract a spirit who is willing to give you what you are looking for. A lot of spirits are not willing or even fully capable of sending messages into the physical dimension, so you need to really take some time to attract someone powerful enough and willing enough.

Usually anywhere that is famous for alien activities will also have a lot of spiritual activity. 
(Eg. Superstition Mountains in Phoenix or Arizona or Skinwalker Ranch in Utah if you can gain access to it. The government has a lot of security in these places because of the alien activity.)


If you have any form of worship, you will communicate with your God(s)/Goddess(es) and sometimes they will respond in very tangible poltergeist-like ways. Gods are tulpas though. They aren't like most spirits with free will. They might be programmed with a temper or mischief, but they are just programmed by the collective consciousness. In my experience, Zozo the Ouija board demon is a tulpa. It is weak and mirrors whatever you believe in and will manifest your fear if you are afraid."
kratom,etpm2r4,t3_bq2pm6,1563059013.0,"Have you gotten any allergic reaction symptoms? Allergies can cause weight gain, bloating and inflammation in tissues. It might be such a mild histamine reaction that it's effects are gradual.

I gained weight too when I was taking large doses because I think I have a mild allergy to kratom, or at least in large amounts. I also feel like my stomach and  bowels must have been irritated because of bloating and swelling in the belly area. It probably caused an imbalance in gut bacteria. 

I broke out in hives once every few months when I was taking large doses every day and I vomited a lot when I had just started taking it, which I read happened to a lot of kratom users, but maybe it wasn't normal for me. I don't have a very sensitive stomach. I always thought I could probably win the show Fear Factor.

I still take moderate doses, but even though the reduction in dosage got rid of the hives, I'm planning on tapering off and quitting for good. I still think it's a great plant, but I can't keep taking something I'm allergic to.

I also just realized that kratom causes shallow breathing sometimes and maybe your body is just processing less oxygen so therefore burning less calories. I know I usually am breathing too slow and shallow from an anxiety issue and that can happen."
magick,ethc59b,t3_cbjsam,1562811473.0,"Aside from meditation (including learning about energy manipulation and practicing that), you should to work on your positivity. The happier and closer to bliss you are, the higher your vibration and the higher the vibration, the faster things manifests. Start trying to find the silver linings in everything. Everytime I notice negative thoughts in my head I try and make the connection to something I find invaluable in my life so it makes misfortune, trauma and failure somewhat valuable to me. 

Positivity is important because you need to embody the reality you want and you need to try and match the vibrations of the reality you want.

Also, the astral realm is a really nice tool for all knowledge and manifestations. I'm trying to master astral projection myself these days. I hear it's the key to manifesting all kinds of spiritual talents. Positivity helps with this because it is easier to achieve when you have complete control of your anxiety."
magick,etbfhtk,t1_etb474b,1562645241.0,"I believe voodoo is the tradition and religious belief invented, developed and practiced in the southern USA and Hoodoo is folk magick (folk magick meaning ancestral magick) which originated from African practitioners and Voodoo is heavily based on it. If anyone said it was made up, they may have meant that it is a relatively new tradition which is a fusion of many American, African and Caribbean religious traditions. 

Hoodoo and every other form of magick was technically made up too, but a long long time ago. All magick is valid and most Gods are thought forms that get reinforced by a large grouping of the collective consciousness. If you've ever seen the series American Gods, they all seem to require human consciousness to believe in them in order to exist. They are real, but humans made them from the collective consciousness. 

The voodoo pantheon (which gives it a religion element) is a specific group of Lwa/Gods all of whom came from hoodoo except for Maman Brigitte who is the same as the Irish Pagan Goddess Brigid (which is her origin) and the same as Saint Bridget whom the Catholic Church recognizes even though she was not a human she's a Goddess who is the consort of Baron Samedi (the lwa statue in the photo in this post) who is the voodoo God/Lwa of Death. 

I get why they made an exception with Maman Brigitte though. She is very easy to work with other than her infamous temper. Again, if you've ever seen the Prime series American Gods, Maman Brigitte was old friends with the Leprechaun/Mad Sweeney which I thought was a nice touch.

(This is long. Sorry. I always go on in-depth tangents when it's late at night.)"
LeftHandPath,espyqfn,t3_c8oefz,1562192344.0,"Very interesting even though I've never liked to use the terms, 'white magick,' and, 'black magick.' Or left and right hand path.

A system of duality just seems like a misleading way to categorize things. No wonder all witches have trouble finding an identity to stick with. It's hard to stay inside the box. Even if a person decides they are a white magician, they could be doing things for their own will and benefited and causing harm and still think of themselves as a white magician.

I think I fit more into the Shaman category because there are no rules. It's just magick and spirits. You can worship or not. You can have moral boundaries or not. Whatever gets you what you desire is at your disposal via astral realm. It's also not culture specific which suits me being mixed race."
magick,esjdd3j,t3_c7ttk0,1562030872.0,"For me it happens when I am missing some kind of message from my spirit guides. I usually take 1111 as a good time to do some manifesting. 4444 usually shows up a lot when I am feeling worried or alone because the message is usually meant to be one of encouragement. 

If you look for it, it is very difficult to discern whether it was a message for you or you were manifesting it so you should try not to look for it. There are also times it shows up enough times that it's impossible that you are the one manifesting it.

The more synchronicity you experience in general, the better you will be able to manifest your reality and the closer you are to your life purpose in this dimension. It means you are on the path you are meant to be when synchronicity occurs relentlessly."
magick,erocpsh,t3_c2wljl,1561075428.0,"It's easy to contact and summon entities. They just have to want to contact you in return. But if you made the attempt, they will hear it. You can gift them something and create relationships with them so they will respond to you. Many of them are tulpas and therefore extensions of your own consciousness. Tulpas also need some form of offering or substantial energy including belief in them to maintain existence. 

And some intentions should come quite easy to most. Everyone can make an intention candle. These intentions which are successful, instantaneously, are usually minor healing/pain relief and things that are usually on the same level of vibration or state of consciousness as the person with the intention. The higher your vibration or state of consciousness, the more expansive and impressive your manifestations are. Some people have even teleported, developed telekinesis, sustained their body without food and water, and levitated which is fascinating to me.

Astral projection requires knowing the workings of your energy body and knowing how to activate the feeling of this different form of consciousness.  It doesn't feel like sleep and it doesn't feel like being awake. Some people get a hang of it quickly and some people take years to learn it. YouTuber and spiritual teacher Ryan Cropper seems to preach that any manifestation stems from the astral plain and that you can manifest and learn anything from that realm of consciousness. Ryan Cropper is very good at astral projection. If there's anyone I'd recommend to look to for advice on the subject, it's him. Most of what I've learned about Astral Projection is from him.

And lucid dreaming just requires intention. For me it happens just because I set the intention before I fell asleep. I can't be over-exhausted if I set the intention though. Because then it will conflict with my desire for deep sleep."
magick,erfgw0n,t3_c1s000,1560808080.0,"I mainly start off with breathing techniques for long enough to fill up your blood with oxygen which gives you that shift you need to clear your mind and I like binaural beats but it's not necessary. At a certain point, I think binaural beats is cheating you out of your education for meditation techniques. 

It's always good to try and activate different levels of consciousness while doing meditation. Like give your third eye a workout and try controlling the energy/chi in your body. Doing so should activate some paranormal abilities and extrasensory perception.

I also recommend learning to master the ability to astral project. It is very useful when doing magick and understanding the spirit realm."
magick,erd3oiv,t3_c0rmhr,1560729946.0,"I wish you luck, I hope you find your lifelong supportive friend group on your travels, and for you to find your way to a better life.

I have some cousins in the Navy. It's actually a really hard life. My cousin spends a lot of Christmases bored on a ship and spends all his off time on land drinking tequila. He barely sees his children. 

But if you know what you want from it, you gotta follow that path I guess. If you are indecisive, have a poor reputation with employers, or lack direction in general, it's a decent path because you make barely any of your own choices and they'll reform you. That's why my cousin needed it. He was an addict before the Navy. So, again, good luck and I hope you find yourself without getting too traumatized. 

And if you decide you want off that ship there's plenty of ways to make decent money. I've been realizing a lot of people I know just buy loads of cheap but half decent quality stuff from China and resell at 10√ó inflated prices on Amazon or Ebay. And people buy it because everyone drinks alcohol and shops online. Lol that's probably a big reason why the quality of everything has decreased over the past 50 years. I've been trying to experiment with this on the side to make extra money too."
magick,epvgovr,t3_bw063c,1559533637.0,"I did a lot of sigils when I started. Any magick spell will work on you if you believe it. It's your own consciousness doing the magick, not necessarily the symbol. 

Personally, I find the changes made to my shadow self are the easiest magick. Even fear of dark entities can be stifled easily with an affirmation. Anger is easy to manage with magick too. Although if the source of these emotions is not dealt with, it won't be permanent. If you want permanent, you need to learn to kill your ego."
