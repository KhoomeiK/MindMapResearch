depression,fh6ttar,t1_fh6ryuc,1581305921.0,"I agree with the teacher, but ‚Äúunconscious survival instinct‚Äù is a very broad phrase. More specifically, the brain is programmed by experiences over time, most significantly when we are young children. If a child experiences consistent negative experiences at the beginning of life (neglect, for example), then the brain gets programmed very quickly to ‚Äúnobody cares about me‚Äù. If that program isn‚Äôt quickly diminished by opposite experiences, then the subconscious program gets stronger and stronger via neural connections. The hardest thing for a person to change are their subconscious emotional responses that became engrained in them as children. It‚Äôs possible though, and I have personally done it. It has taken over a decade of therapies, diet, meditation, and other healing practices. The most effective teacher on this subject, in my opinion, is Dr. Joe Dispenza (YouTube). Although I don‚Äôt personally subscribe to his healing strategies or practices, I am a firm believer that he is spot on in his theories about subconscious programming, and how it occurs so subtly every day of our lives.

As a side note, despite being on tons of different AD‚Äôs, I‚Äôve never felt like they are the key. I use them more like an oxygen mask that I need every day.

Anyway, in terms of your last statements, Americans absolutely love cheap labor and ironically states like Texas (red state) would see a very sharp rise in their CPI if they did something about illegal immigration. Most of the red neck Trump supporting Texans would quickly regret their illegal immigration stance when they realize that their truck driving salary can no longer afford the things it currently affords (which isn‚Äôt much). However, the problem is not as simple as ‚Äúif employers would just stop hiring them...‚Äù because the much bigger issue is that most Americans applying for those jobs ($8-15/hr) are HORRIBLE employees. They are typically unreliable, uneducated, and unrealistic about what they‚Äôre worth. This is why massive amounts of money will flow into automating those positions to AI in the short term. For now, illegal immigrants are the only ones who will show up early, work hard, and stay late for $11/hr."

WhitePeopleTwitter,f0zv7ls,t3_d793v2,1569103423.0,"I laugh when people say that. First, the average was in the 30‚Äôs because there was a significantly large number of infant deaths that brought the average down. It‚Äôs not because most people actually died in their 30‚Äôs. Secondly, our average is much higher now because we keep seniors alive for an extra 10 years pumping then full of chemicals in nursing homes and hospice care. The true measure of health of a society should never be length of life. It should be quality of health."
