I also know that right after my last time in a lock down unit for attempting suicide is when I met my future husband. If you'd have told me, sitting there in that lock down unit, that I was about to experience the best time of my life I would have called you a liar.

These feelings will pass so just hold on. High school is not the real world. It doesn't behave like the real world in any way. So all this awkardness you feel will go away. It will be easier to form relationships. You begin to realize everyone else is just as jacked up as you are so there's no reason to feel self conscious.

You're not going to die alone. Because you've spent this time feeling depressed and lonely, I suspect you are going to be sensitive to the needs of others and people are going to consider you a very good friend. The kind that doesn't run at the first sight of trouble. How do I know this? Because people who come from depressed, self conscious, low self esteem backgrounds in their youth turn around to become some of the strongest, kindest adults you'll ever want to meet.

Also tell your brain to stop being such a jerk. Honestly if you catch yourself having negative thoughts stop the thought right there. Change it. Takes practice but it does work. You may want to consider therapy. Talking stuff out is often incredibly helpful. Wouldn't think so but it is.

It's important right now to get plenty of rest. Eat right. High carb, high sugar foods will do nothing for you except put you on a high / crash cycle. Most importantly exercise.

First, stop blaming yourself for not having done more the day of the fight.

Your mom is the adult and it was her son. I'm sure she would have told you the same. I would never want my 16 yr old thinking he had to intervene into something like that.

I know it's hard having a brother that's alive but you still feel like you've lost him. I'm afraid you're learning a painful lesson early in life. Sometimes you have to let the people you love go, as hard as it is to do so. God willing he figures out how to get himself clean before he dies and you two can start a relationship again in the future. I commend you for distancing yourself when you realized it was having a negative impact on your life. That's a very mature thing to do and not easy.

You and your family may want to consider counseling for families of addicts. If for no other reason than to have a place to talk about why you're hurting. Families of addicts suffer. The lying and stealing and constant emotional trauma they put their families through can be brutal.

Corporal punishment is practiced by many families. My personal belief is if a few more kids were spanked there wouldn't be quite as many assholey kids in the world today.

Many Christian groups ban birth control.

mentalillness,ete82qw,t3_cb3u0a,1562725348.0,Dress however you feel most comfortable. Very cool that you would worry about how others might be affected. Shows maturity and that you are no longer just in your own head. I think you are gonna kick ass and take names in life... In a good way!

Try to keep from getting to not give a fuck (or maybe it is give a fuck stage) stage while drinking and keep quiet because you don't want to start any family shit. Best of luck"
confessions,etb7ih8,t3_cajbyz,1562639017.0,"I fear them mostly because they are egocentric, stupid, assholes who, while practicing what is dangerously close to a pseudoscience they have no qualms with prescribing dangerous antipsychotics without really knowing the long term effects. Not that I have strong feelings..... once in a long while one comes along and is decent. Problem is how do you find them?"
confessions,etb6zbn,t3_caftif,1562638624.0,I knew a guy who would pee in the family's little paper Dixie cups for water and then put them back. So....I guess there's a subset of male populations that during adolescence pee into family things.
confessions,etb6mkd,t3_cak3s2,1562638363.0,Seems like a good choice. We'll allow it.
confessions,etb6c2n,t3_cacjid,1562638142.0,"I totally understand. I get it. My dog passed away recently and I cried every day for months. You have got to get another animal and let yourself feel love again. Animals have a shorter life span than we do but during that time they show us how to love unconditionally. Please. Many, many animals need help and you need to love again."

I don't, can you find a way to still have a relationship with your parents. Perhaps take that subject off the table. No discussion of it. They aren't trying to be bad, just misguided. All my best."

confessions,etb1g4q,t3_caekax,1562634581.0,I know the pain can be intense beyond anything you every imagined. Especially since it sounds like he did a great job of mind fucking you as well. You know you're at the point where you're not handling it well by yourself. Please talk to your doctor. Start with a parent if you need but at this point you need outside help. Even a few sessions can help immensely. Best of luck. I swear it will get better.
confessions,etb15fi,t3_calyx2,1562634365.0,Absolutely sexual assault. It's good you feel remorse. Very good but the suggestion of counseling is the best advice. At 19 you can go see whomever you want and your father doesn't ever have to know. It doesn't have to be years of therapy even a couple of sessions can be effective. Go. Best wishes.
confessions,etb0pbe,t3_cajs89,1562634042.0,Yeah. This is not a Reddit issue. This is an MD issue. Potentially an urgent one. Could be something that gets cleared up with a script from your local pharmacy but that is not for anyone on Reddit to decide. Best regards. Hope your feel better.

I was molested by multiple people too, though my story is no where near as awful as yours, I am amazed how they seem to know who to victimize. It's a shame the adult victims have to carry the burden of what their abusers did. It sounds like you are trying to work through what took place. I wish you all the best. Please look after yourself. You are an amazing person. Strong. Much stronger than everyone because of what happened. I had to come back too. I beat myself down and allowed myself to be victimized over and over. No more. That was a long time ago and a different person. Really, best wishes to you."
confessions,etaws1x,t3_cak7fv,1562631198.0,Okay. Time to quit beating yourself up. You aren't doing her any favors you aren't doing you any favors. Most people in this life will have been treated badly and treated someone else badly. Then we grow and learn to not be taken advantage of or take advantage. Put the lessons to work. Begin to like yourself again thats how you become ready for the next girl of your dreams and I swear she's out there. This time you'll know how to handle it. Best of luck
