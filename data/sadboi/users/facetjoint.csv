bipolar,fglgsy4,t1_fglfs8o,1580897006.0,On Seroquel I worked out that if slept for 13-15 hours then I’d ok. Unfortunately that was impossible with work/family life. I feel your pain.
BipolarReddit,fglfgpq,t3_eytes3,1580895019.0,Meds for me don’t stop the Stresses of life they just mitigate the Bipolar highs and lows a bit. I still have good days and bad days regardless of meds and Bipolar. It’s just insulting asking if “you’ve taken your meds” as if it’s a magic fix-all.
bipolar,fglfczg,t1_fgk3ri0,1580894862.0,You could be describing me exactly. I really didn’t get on with Seroquel. Luckily my Psych put me on a relatively short cross taper to Abilify. I’m awake in the mornings. Almost forgotten what it feels like to wake up and be able to function straight away.
bipolar,fgleieg,t1_fgij2xg,1580893613.0,"I’ve been as low as 25mg and as high as 400mg. Weight gain, drowsiness, nausea, sweating, sugar cravings, tremors. The list goes on. Worst was depression. It left me in a super depressed state for a year. Took the last 50mg last night and had a family group hug. We’re all pleased to see that back of that med."
bipolar,fgiitur,t1_fgi4mns,1580822931.0,Seroquel really fucked me up but I can tolerate Abilify. Weird.
bipolar,fgezwqk,t1_fgevpee,1580717088.0,DJ equipment for me. I’m not even a working DJ.
Fantasy,fgcrm28,t3_exuoe2,1580675635.0,I’m enjoying The Black Prism (audiobook) at the moment. Haven’t read the other though.
