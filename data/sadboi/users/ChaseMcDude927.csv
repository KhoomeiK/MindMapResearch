You have to love yourself my friend.

I know because this is exactly how I used to think. I thought a was a terrible “human.” Half a person. Some dickhead that no one wanted to understand. I quickly turned to people pleasing in hopes of gaining acceptance. People began taking advantage of my submissiveness, and I became some pathetic asshole, robbed of my own backbone. 

Then I woke up one day and realized, “Why the fuck am I putting so much energy into being someone else’s bitch, but not myself??” 

From then on, I decided it was time to define who I was. It isn’t someone else’s job to do that. 

I began running every morning for 20 minutes (mind you I used to be that malnourished kid that refused to play sports) and eventually started lifting. On top of that, I attempted to master some of the things I love (skateboarding, guitar.) My self esteem went up, and my jaded mindset slowly started to fade. People were easier to talk to.

Now people look up to me. I have given myself purpose through my own hardship and struggle. This all happened over the span of 20 years, having only made progress within the last 3. I have shit I can be proud of, a girlfriend that’s drop dead gorgeous, and friends I can count on. I wouldn’t have any of this if I didn’t put in the work I did.

In my experience, you can overcome everything if you try hard enough. You sound depressed, so start with something small. Try exercising 5 days a week until you look and feel better than 90% of the petty fatasses on this planet, and eat healthy too. You’ll have something you can be proud of when you feel like you have nothing else."
