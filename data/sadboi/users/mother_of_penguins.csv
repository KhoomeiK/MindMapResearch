And my sister has bipolar 2 and is on prozac and an antipsychotic (a different one, but I can’t remember which one) and it helps her immensely. It helps the depression without making her hypomanic. I know from knowing others with bp2 that the combo is really common and helpful, and I hope it helps you. Hopefully someone with bp2 taking these meds comes along but I hope at least this gives you some comfort for now."

I’ve known too many people that got a credit card right at 18 to “build credit”, bought shit they couldn’t afford, then couldn’t pay the bill when it came. Then it goes to collections, and is much bigger than the initial bill. My friend is still trying to repair her credit over 10 years later so she can buy a house because of a what was initially a $200 Old Navy credit card bill.

Edit: getting a credit card and using it minimally, paying it off each month IS a great way to build credit, but I think waiting until someone is a little older is wise. 18 is still really young, and it takes a lot of self control to not overuse a credit card."

The hospital opened around 1910 and had over a thousand patients; at one point almost three thousand. It was pretty much what you’d imagine (though older locals try to paint a rosier picture because the hospital was a MAJOR job source until it closed in the 70s); people were deemed “insane” who did *not* need to be institutionalized, and experimental drugs, lobotomies, even sterilizations were used/performed. 

Most of the hospital’s remains are inaccessible to the public. But to most of those that have been in (including SciFi’s Ghost Hunters!) it’s haunted. I’ve heard there’s a nurse that cries and tall man that walks around I think. Lol I’m sure there’s more specifics than that.

SelfHarmScars,ero7g4z,t3_c2lcgd,1561070312.0,"I have complex PTSD from an abusive childhood and often dissociate after a trigger. I try healthier coping skills but cutting is the quickest way to snap out of it. To feel something again. Sometimes I keep going even after I snap back because I feel like a pile of shit that deserves it. There’s more that has to do with the blood, but it’s hard to describe and honestly I’m only a week “clean” and don’t want to go into much more detail. That’s just a basic explanation of my relationship with self harm."
selfharm,ero60fi,t3_c2yukk,1561069145.0,That is really insensitive. I’d talk to him about it if he has other redeeming qualities and you feel like he’s worth investing in. Maybe ask him why he said that and tell him how it made you feel. I’m sorry he said that; I can’t imagine how uncomfortable that was and how that must have made you feel.

AskReddit,erm6lla,t3_c2rw9n,1561008054.0,"One is just...a nice person 

One has ulterior motives and gets pissed off when they don’t get their way, like “you are the most amazing and beautiful woman I have ever laid eyes on” “thanks, I’m not interested though” “FUCK YOU CUNT I WAS LYING YOU’RE AN UGLY SLUT”

AskReddit,erm5woj,t1_erm4v22,1561007307.0,Yeah saying they smell like ass is definitely just an implication that someone isn’t perfect and is in no way racist fuckin snowflakes
AskReddit,erm5lqn,t3_c2rki2,1561006986.0,"Some super drunk guy at a bar asked me if it made me wet when a guy like that made my drink (the bartender was a dude). I just told him to go fuck himself and walked away but laying in bed that night I thought of “no, but this makes you wet” and splashing my drink in his face."
