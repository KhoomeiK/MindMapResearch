People love that shit. I've found that bar guests aren't listening 50-80% of the time anyway. So if they start a conversation with something like, ""damn it's cold today..""' sometimes I will literally just talk about all the things the cold reminds me of. 

You think this is bad? I lived in Chicago! The worst temp I ever experienced was..
 Or, yea it's cold, but it was so hot for so long and damn this one time I didn't have air conditioning.. etc etc ad infinitum .
