5/19/2020
Immune warriors known as T cells help us fight some viruses, but their importance for battling SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been unclear. Now, two studies reveal infected people harbor T cells that target the virus—and may help them recover. Both studies also found some people never infected with SARS-CoV-2 have these cellular defenses, most likely because they were previously infected with other coronaviruses.

“This is encouraging data,” says virologist Angela Rasmussen of Columbia University. Although the studies don’t clarify whether people who clear a SARS-CoV-2 infection can ward off the virus in the future, both identified strong T cell responses to it, which “bodes well for the development of long-term protective immunity,” Rasmussen says. The findings could also help researchers create better vaccines.

The results suggest “one reason that a large chunk of the population may be able to deal with the virus is that we may have some small residual immunity from our exposure to common cold viruses,” says viral immunologist Steven Varga of the University of Iowa. However, neither of the studies attempted to establish that people with crossreactivity don’t become as ill from COVID-19.

Before these studies, researchers didn’t know whether T cells played a role in eliminating SARS-CoV-2, or even whether they could provoke a dangerous immune system overreaction. “These papers are really helpful because they start to define the T cell component of the immune response,” Rasmussen says. But she and other scientists caution that the results do not mean that people who have recovered from COVID-19 are protected from reinfection.

I think this will start to get reported on soon. But I think it points to the fact that reopening is going to be ok. And I think most everything we are seeing about other places reopening...it is going to be ok.

I don’t want anyone to get carried away with this, BUT an article was very recently published suggesting that there may be a cross-reactive t-cell response in some people. Meaning if you’ve had another coronavirus in maybe the last year (more like six months), and if you came in contact with covid, it may have just been handled by your t-cells that were developed by your other infection, and you didn’t get sick. Or, you had very mild symptoms. 
This isn’t the first time this has been found either. 

It does not mean we are done with it. Tcell response fades over time, whereas antibody response lasts longer (I think). But the good thing is, we may have a large proportion of people who won’t get sick long enough for a vaccine. So that would affect the spread (hey, how many cases did London have yesterday?)

Scotland: Report reveals there have been no new Covid admissions to ICU for at least 10 days

5/14/2020
NO new patients with Covid-19 have been admitted to intensive care in Scotland for at least 10 days, as the death toll from the virus fell for a second week in a row.

With fewer than 500 critically ill coronavirus patients requiring ICU treatment so far, admissions appear to have stalled.

The Scottish Government had set a target of quadrupling Scotland’s intensive care capacity to 700 beds amid fears that the NHS would be overwhelmed.

The World Health Organization said on Tuesday that some treatments appear to be limiting the severity or length of the COVID-19 disease and that it was focusing on learning more about four or five of the most promising ones.

The Geneva-based WHO is leading a global initiative to develop safe and effective vaccines, tests and drugs to prevent, diagnose and treat COVID-19. The respiratory illness has infected 4.19 million people around the world, according to a Reuters tally.

“We do have some treatments that seem to be in very early studies limiting the severity or the length of the illness but we do not have anything that can kill or stop the virus,” spokeswoman Margaret Harris told a briefing, referring to the body’s so-called Solidarity Trial of drugs against the disease.

Harris did not name the treatments. Gilead Science Inc says its antiviral drug Remdesivir has helped improve outcomes for COVID-19 patients.

The Canadian government announced it will boost the pay of frontline and essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in a $4 billion Canadian dollar ($2.85 billion USD) deal.

The Labor leaders applauded the federal government’s move of contributing nearly 75 percent of the total to the effort, which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called “deserved.”

The remaining 25 percent of the deal will be funded by the territories and provinces. They can independently decide who qualifies for the pay bumps. 

“The bottom line is this: if you’re risking your health to keep this country moving and you’re making minimum wage, you deserve a raise,” Trudeau said during his daily news conference.
