They have their version of a debit card that i got (not a credit card). It just takes the money out of your Venmo balance when you use it. I like that so it’s always accessible. Also, if you make a purchase with the Venmo card, you can split the bill and charge your friends Venmo accounts directly. 

Also you can have it transferred to your bank for free but it takes a couple of days. They also have an instant transfer too, but that costs 1% up to $10. But if you’re itching for money you can do a quick instant transfer."

But I did find that the crest can appear or become larger when the anoles are trying to be more aggressive. Researchers think it is to make them look bigger.
