The first one is Treasure Planet.
I always loved this movie, everything about it is fantastic. The music from a better time, the detail in the animation, the whole premise and setting (pirates in the future). All i can say is if you haven't seen it yet, i highly recommend it.



The second film would be Koe no Katachi (A Silent Voice).
I have never seen an animated film capture sign language, and human interaction like this. Addressing how people communicate, react emotionally to those who are different and unable to (ie. Being deaf, or shunned by others and your own mind).

This movie had me in tears not just because it was a beautiful story and animated well. It was relatable how the protagonist couldn't talk or even look at other people (visualized by an X over their faces). 

Due to Kimi no na wa (Your Name) being released very close and gaining such popularity, A Silent Voice was buried under the wake of it's success. I personally love A Silent Voice over Your Name, but both are amazing movies."
