astrology,fhv0vl8,t3_f4tosz,1581892180.0,"Hi! I’m a Taurus sun, Leo moon, Taurus rising..


1. What are the first impressions people get from you?

I’m more reserved and quiet. I appear much more social at work when I “have” to be but don’t really like to socialize otherwise. I have my moments when I do, but typically don’t prefer it. In my role as a manager, I can appear intimidating because I know what I’m talking about (mostly). I like to feel people out before I start making jokes or being sarcastic.


2. Do you have a soft voice or more like loud? What type of voice do you have? Is it low or high pitched?

I feel like I have a softer voice. When I get excited I definitely get louder. It’s lower but definitely still feminine (I am a woman).



3. How slow and lazy are you? Do you feel like you are too slow and take too much time for everything? 

My laziness can fluctuate. At work I don’t feel like I’m extra lazy but I can definitely be at home. If I’m new to something (at work or home) I will take my time with it to ensure it’s done correctly. Sometimes I need to be taught something several times before it sticks.



4. Are you introverted or extroverted? Are you sociable and talkative?

Definitely introverted. I’ve have social anxiety since I was a preteen. I’m much better now as an adult. At work, you wouldn’t figure I was introverted.

Moral of the story, my work personality and home personality are two different people."

WalgreensStores,f9tnhaf,t1_f9sjrwa,1575633307.0,"The way they rolled it out was extremely poor too. Store managers had a misunderstanding and were doing it wrong. Questions weren’t being answering.

Luckily for us we haven’t had that problem as much with our truck. It’s typically my SM, ASM, or myself putting up truck and if we don’t know where something is we stick it to the side for a tech to put up or ask then and there."
WalgreensStores,f9tnejb,t3_e6nhrr,1575633215.0,"This is the #1 cause of stress at my store other than being understaffed and they both exacerbate one another. We have our SM, ASM, ASM-T (me), one SFL, and no DHs.

My manager goes back there, dumps the queue, and is filling indefinitely. We usually have one stack of “due soon” scripts and one stack of past dues/other day scripts. Even when putting the “due soon” scripts in a separate pile and letting the pharmacist know that these are due soon, they almost always become past due. So our struggling VBPT is falling more.

The manager fills until he is called away for something (he sometimes opens by himself). I usually try to relieve him or another manager who opened when I come in so they can actually do something else. Truck gets put away, OOS & PFLs are released (which typically adds 20ish more to the pile).

At this point we have 70-100 printed. One tech tries to help fill if possible. Our role of helping get caught up by printing ahead becomes, “can you fill scripts for XYZ, they’re waiting,” and trying to salvage our VBPT in any way we can, therefore not getting the ones done that were printed ahead. Managers often leave out of necessity to work on our truck that’s already past due, catch calls, or they’re just fed up with working in the Rx for hours.

It’s extremely rare for us to have a closing tech. They last tech usually leaves around 9p (we close at 10p) although I have seen the last tech leave at 8p. We do get slower at this point but there’s also usually 50+ left to fill. The closing manager attempts to make sure all of their duties are done and helps the pharmacist until closing. Front tasks get heavily neglected and pushed the wayside while it looks like nothing got done in pharmacy.

I am beyond frustrated with how this is going. Any complaints made to our DM and DPR are met with, “sorry, it’s just gotta get done.” It’s supposedly temporary. I can’t remember a day since this started that I haven’t spent a minimum of 3-4hr in the RX a day. I already feel like a glorified SFL and now I just feel like a pharmacy tech."
WalgreensStores,f9sc0un,t3_e6nhrr,1575589427.0,I’m almost convinced that you’re in my area. This is our new code green to the T. I honestly think putting up truck & releasing OOS & PFLs makes sense.
