You do indeed go to the county jail while you are awaiting trial for murder if you don’t have money for bond, or in this case no bond was granted. Once sentencing occurs, they will be transferred into the prison system, unless this becomes designated as a Federal hate crime, which might land them in federal vs state prison. 

The Georgia prison system, while not as skewed as some other states, is still 60% Black. You are most likely right, either they’ll get with a group that will protect them, or they’ll be on death row in individual cells. Most likely not death row, as the current charge is 2nd degree murder."

The few times I’ve seen this behavior from Dashers, I rarely see them again. My perspective may be different, I’m single and if I’m not Dashing I’m just chilling at the house or sleeping. I don’t think I’ve gotten annoyed at a wait time more than 3-4 times out of 3500 deliveries. I have definitely learned what places I don’t want to pick up from, and reject those even if they’re decent paying, as I know the wait and potentially parking situation don’t make it worth the time. I can understand why Dashers with families or other things to attend to would get annoyed by this. For me, I really am not too worried, what else am I going to do? I’ll read something on Kindle or play a phone game. No stress day, and I still end up making good money.

By helping the maid, you're: 

1) Putting your own feelings at the forefront, you're helping the maid because **you're** uncomfortable. Your unconscious bias is actually that being a maid makes her less than, and you feel pity for someone just doing honest work.

2) You're breaking the house rules. The parents told you not to do something, you proceed to do it anyway.

3) Your statement ""My instinct is to help"" but you are failing to consider the fact that maybe what you consider help isn't. Your bumbling your way into a situation you're not familiar with. If you're helping her, it also puts her in a bad position, because you may be hindering her work, but she might feel like she's breaking a boundary to complain about the ""help"" you're providing.

4) Everything you wrote screams ""Me, Me, Me"" – you're centering this whole situation on how you feel, in essence you're being selfish. You're putting your emotional discomfort at a priority above the maid, the parents, and your girlfriend. 

With that being said, it's not always easy to know how to act in new and unfamiliar situations. The next time your encounter one, sit back for a minute and take cues from the people who are familiar with the situation. Take another second to figure out if you're have a fear or guilt reaction to a problem that doesn't really exist, the problem is actually caused by your mental framework. Worth repeating: **take cues from others around you to feel out the situation before you take action.**"

For me it was a variety of things that happened at once. End of a relationship, drinking too much, and then looking up and seeing nothing was happening in my life. 

Once you get your life back on track, an important step is to not focus too much on external display or dialogue of the progress you're making and the lifestyle you're growing into. Often for me, because I had a negative view of myself in the past, I would look for validation from others to confirm that they saw I changed. I wanted to be respected as the person I now was versus the slug I was before. The only issue with this is that your friends didn't look down on you as much as you did when you were low, and conversely they're probably happy you're doing better, but beyond that they're as self-consumed as anyone else. 

A thing that helped me when I do speaking to an audience or in a large group, is I say to myself ""Nobody here can hate me more than I've hated myself during my darkest days."" which almost immediately takes away any fear.

If you want your friends to change, just live your life the way you choose to, and if they're interested in change they'll ask you for help or advice. When I was low, nothing anybody said could make me change, I had to make that decision. The same goes for my/your friends. If they want to change, they will, and they might ask for your help. If they don't want to change, there's nothing you can do to convince them."

I will admit I’m benignly sociopathic and don’t really care about or empathize with individual people. Nowhere on the spectrum, I have been an extrovert most of my life. I have no issue when I do public speaking every month or so, and I’ve never had social anxiety. I got to a point where people were less interesting than self improvement - reading, writing, exercise, healthy sleep, etc. I donate to charities and volunteer semi regularly, but this is because I learned that it’s an effective way to not totally disengage from a responsibility to care for the human race as a whole.

I know people’s names at restaurants I hit often, another pro free food factor."

If I recall correctly, it refers to someone who has experience and/or skill from training, war, etc. So theoretically only once you have experienced yourself in ""monster mode"" whether in a training or real world environment, you really don't know if you're capable or not. Skilled fighters I know are some of the calmest and relaxed people I know, I suppose a combination of confidence in being able to keep themselves/loved ones safe and getting aggression out at the gym. It would be a better tweet if the idea was credited or linked to something informational, rather than a low grade recycling of someone else's concept without citing them."

MensLib,ewgrph1,t1_ewgnzf9,1565388839.0,"My experience has been different. Nobody has talked down to me, called me a failure, or been generally horrible to me more than myself. I have a great circle of family and friends that all believe in me way more than I believe in myself. After a lot of work, I've learned to change my self beliefs, self identity and self talk patterns. It took focused directed work, a great therapist and a lot of learning self awareness, but it can certainly be done 😊"
BlackPeopleTwitter,eu5tfoe,t1_eu04ihk,1563484957.0,It does annoy me that they took away the ability to just buy and replace a battery in the evening quest for thinner machines. So now you have to pay labor costs on the parts cost.

I've always ponied up for the max storage iPhone, and most of my other electronics. Future proofs stuff and lets me upgrade every 3-4 years instead of 1-2 years. I have a TON of apps I use daily, and still am fine with the 6s. I'm waiting on the integrated fingerprint sensor in the display which will hopefully come out on the next gen. It would be nice to have a 2nd wide angle front camera for Facetime/video chat, but I'd be surprised if I see that."

The quote I save in my audio files and I think the best part of the book is Manson's Law of Avoidance (emphasis mine).

&#x200B;

>""**The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it**. That means the more something threatens to change how you view yourself, how successful or unsuccessful you believe yourself to be, how well you see yourself living up to your values – the more you will avoid to ever getting around to doing it.  
>  
>There's a certain comfort that comes from knowing how you fit in the world, anything that shakes up that comfort, even if it could potentially makes your life better, is inherently scary.  
>  
>Manson's law applies to both good and bad things in life. Making a million dollars could threaten your identity just as much as losing all your money. Becoming a famous rock star could threaten your identity just as much as losing their job. **This is why people are often so afraid of success, for the exact same reason they are afraid of failure. It threatens who they believe themselves to be.""**"

It's a nice bonus, but for me I never eat until I get home or else I'm sleepy throughout the shift, so while it's nice the food usually goes to waste."
mac,eqaxfy0,t1_eq94qn2,1559941641.0,"Yup. I can't recall ever hearing anyone say the 2015 MacBook Pro was too thick. Yet here we are with an almost universally reviled keyboard and everything soldered on. It's a cash grab all day. In the span of things the iPhone profit margin is way higher than the Mac products, and they sell way more of them too. It's the continual slide that's happened since 2008 and the Mac user became second place to the iPhone user. Keep the Macbook Air the Air, or call it a Pro-Air or whatever, and leave the power/options/modularity in the Macbook Pro. Still not going PC, which in and of itself might contribute to the problem. Apple knows they can push Mac users pretty far and we're still going to be loyal to the OS, to say nothing of iOS developer needs. *Mild rant over*"

mac,eq7nz6w,t1_eq7n6rj,1559850211.0,"Yeah, the Macbook Pros really took a dump when they dumped the Magsafe power connector and all ports but USB-C/Thunderbolt, and the soldered in ram on most new Macs is really a selfish/controlling move.
