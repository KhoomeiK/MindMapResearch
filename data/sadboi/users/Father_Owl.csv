technology,fp8so39,t1_fp8muuq,1588401684.0,"You're right. Politicians generally don't give a fuck about the people they represent. It's all about enriching their own family and friends. I'd prefer a system where we just see a pie chart of where their campaign money is coming from so we know what industry is going to fuck us over if that person wins. Politicians are there to further corporate interests, not support common people."

ShingekiNoKyojin,fjt357o,t1_fjt2iac,1583603255.0,That's why I love this story. Nobody is morally clean and everyone's hands are dirty. There's no safe way out. I said it previously but maybe this story isn't about the chosen one who finally ends the cycle and unites the world into a peaceful utopia forever. Maybe it's about the eventual repercussions of a world that refused to change it's hateful ways.
ShingekiNoKyojin,fjt20zm,t1_fjt1rg4,1583602685.0,When I say willfully ignorant I mean they knew about the concentration camps and essentially said hmmmm probably nothing to see there.
ShingekiNoKyojin,fjsyj24,t1_fjr4xd5,1583601583.0,"This demonstrates the greatness of Isayamas story telling. There is no safe or moral way out of the situation. We're emotionally invested in characters on all sides. We understand most of their motivations whether they are morally justified or otherwise. Some fucked up shit is going to happen and many people are going to die. We're going to see who sees their plan through to the end, not who is morally right."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fjsvuz7,t1_fjqsqbi,1583600948.0,"They are willfully ignorant of the truth. And apparently cool with Marley running concentration camps. The world still didn't learn of Marley's atrocities at the festival. The message was basically yeah here's why we keep these devils locked up but let's get together and kill them all. When it could have been hey listen, we've been doing some fucked up shit like feeding little girls to dogs and transforming humans into giant humanoid killing machines. The festival was carefully orchestrated to ally the world with Marley against Paradis and buy them more time before the world's militaries developed anti titan tech."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fjst9cp,t1_fjqueb3,1583600292.0,"In a way, he is. Things have continued escalating for 2000 years or so. Something like this was bound to happen eventually.

ShingekiNoKyojin,fjpuyck,t1_fjporya,1583561298.0,Guess the world should have stomped out the faceless devils when they had a chance. Instead they chose to fuck around and torture them with titans for a long ass time. I bet they're regretting that now!
ShingekiNoKyojin,fjpusks,t1_fjp60di,1583561132.0,Spot on. The world either ignored or actively participated in what was going on with the eldians.

ShingekiNoKyojin,fdnjsxl,t1_fdmmiel,1578587291.0,"I don't see that OP specifically said Erwin was a better choice only at the point in time it was being made. People in this thread are saying that Erwin would have prevented the rumbling etc. So you're trying to narrow the scope but also widen it at the same time. As soon as you start getting into what Erwin would have done better, you have to broaden the scope to include whatever feats Armin may have by the end. Since we aren't at the end, it's really hard to discuss effectively. It's like trying to argue that it was a bad decision for Eren to rescue Armin by jumping in the mouth of a Titan without considering information from future chapters as to what happened as a result of that decision. It's completely pointless. Heichou said it best -  No matter what kind of wisdom dictates the option you pick, no one will be able to tell if it's right or wrong until you arrive to some sort of outcome from your choice. And that's exactly what you're trying to do here, which means you kind of missed the point on one of the central themes of this story."

ShingekiNoKyojin,fdlaow4,t1_fdlagkd,1578520008.0,"True, but talk and execution are 2 different things. I haven't heard anyone come up with an idea of how to resolve things without rumbling. Candidates make promises all the time but frequently fail to accomplish what they promise."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdl5g28,t1_fdl25di,1578517363.0,"Well thought out, but a partial rumbling only buys time before the rest of the world allies and wipes out Paradis. Eventually they will develop weapons to make titans obsolete and they are further ahead than Paradis. You also specify that the titan powers will disappear somehow which only makes Paradis more vulnerable in the long run. It's pretty much pure speculation that Erwin negotiates for peace somehow."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdl23jm,t1_fdl1nr8,1578515731.0,Please explain what he would have done. I'll wait...
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdkw13s,t1_fdkvlk6,1578512324.0,"True but if Erwin had slowed down a bit there were multiple signs they were walking into a trap. Don't get me wrong, I don't see anyone else being a better commander but Erwin has flaws too. Again, you can make a judgment call at this point but until the story ends we won't have all the information necessary to make a determination."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdkvhuu,t1_fdkuswd,1578512008.0,"Good point, they were pretty screwed in that situation and possibly no other options. But there were multiple signs as they approached the battle that they were walking into a trap. So to use your own tactic against you, how would Erwin have stopped the rumbling? I haven't seen anyone present a viable solution and I read these threads pretty regularly. Like the battle of RTS, the manga makes it pretty clear that they looked into other options and found no other way that wouldn't lead to their demise. You could maybe betray Eren and have someone eat him in his weakened post transformation state, but that won't stop Marley from wiping out Paradis."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdkuass,t1_fdkosn2,1578511300.0,"I love Erwin but he really got his ass handed to him by Zeke in the Return to Shiganshina. His strategy was to sacrifice every last soldier for a hail mary shot at the beast titan. Not the greatest. Armin was the one who came up with the plan that defeated the colossal and saved Eren. If it weren't for him, the story ends a couple chapters later when Marley gets the founder back and annihilates Paradis. I think Armin deserved the colossal based on the fact that he took it down while Erwin was busy sending the entire force to their death."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdktowy,t1_fdkq3mb,1578510941.0,Ehh. I can think of another character who's been chilling in a crystal for more than 30 chapters and will likely have a significant impact on the ending of the story.
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdkoh7m,t1_fdknsqg,1578507834.0,I love this idea.
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdkoa77,t1_fdknf2i,1578507718.0,"You can't really say with certainty that Erwin would have been able to stop the rumbling. But going forward, Armin still has time to prove he was the right choice. It could have been a good ending for Armin to die in Shiganshina, but apparently he still has more to do. Remember, a soldier shall not die until he has given meaning to his life."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdknqfo,t1_fdkndlj,1578507385.0,The point is you can only judge up to this point in the story and don't know what feats Armin may have by the time the story concludes. Up to this point Erwin was the better choice. Armin isn't dead yet so he still has a chance to prove you wrong.
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdknhdr,t3_elvyta,1578507234.0,"So for me it looks like someone tied a yellow piece of cloth around a stick. Could it be a makeshift flag of some kind? I can't really connect it to a specific character though, given that the manga is black and white...."
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdkmqhm,t3_elw5pr,1578506775.0,Kinda pointless to argue this until the story has concluded.
ShingekiNoKyojin,fdfm8vh,t1_fdfkoz8,1578364961.0,"Precisely. Up to this point in the story, Erwin may have been the better choice. There's still time for Armin to show us why he was the better choice."
