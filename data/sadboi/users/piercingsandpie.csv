ptsd,eu4hm9t,t3_cemx2h,1563454162.0,"100% agree, esp the jokes abt obscure things being triggers bc obviously obscure things are triggers!! like the worst flashback I've ever had was triggered by drinking milk and now I avoid it all costs. its just so annoying when ppl make dumb jokes like ""oh I hate coffee I'm so triggered lol!!!!"" it really belittles how random and mundane triggering scenarios can be and how PTSD sufferers often have to force themselves to adjust bc they're thrust into triggering scenarios every day. makes me angry >:("
