Make sure mug is at least twice as big as the mixture, it will expand. Microwave for 1 minute. And voila. 100 calorie brownie (overestimated the calories a bit). Sometimes I‚Äôll add a tbsp or 2 of chocolate chips or let peanut butter melt on the top and it‚Äôs great!"
EDAnonymous,fbrxrid,t1_fbr4tdr,1577047551.0,This is the first time I have ever seen people mention loose skin and how it reacts with body dysmorphia. I feel so validated omfg. This whole little thread is .. me.
EDAnonymous,fb7ykzy,t3_ebt68b,1576602264.0,And then there‚Äôs me who ordered an americano with 2 pumps of sugar free mocha syrup ... for taste I said put a little whipped cream on top .. then got pissed off because the whipped cream just dissolved and it tasted like shit the whole time anyway so I had all of those extra calories when I could have just got a black coffee.  ruined my whole day. üôÉ
EDAnonymous,fal3kj7,t3_e9qr88,1576177806.0,"Same same same. Started at BMI 58 and down to 27, 24 at my lowest. I constantlY feeling invalid. I used to be a constant binge eater and now I jump from binging and restricting like it‚Äôs parkour. My resting heart rate is always under 60 and my lowest resting heart rate has been 37.  Even with the numerous side effects of disordered eating I just feel so invalid because I still have so much fat and loose skin and can eat 2-4K calories in one sitting sometimes. But reading your post I am mentally validating you but still can‚Äôt admit to myself that I have an ED. Must be an ED side affect. Needless to say you‚Äôre not alone and you deserve to recover and be healthy."

EDAnonymous,fa8pg2w,t1_fa8oi7l,1575851595.0,I didn‚Äôt get it either. I kept asking why it makes her anxious but she couldn‚Äôt explain and just kept making me feel worse. Makes me think that she sees me in a negative way and feels guilty for it. Idk.
EDAnonymous,f78fcjr,t3_dunbw7,1573492161.0,when I used to abuse laxatives I shit myself while hanging out with a friend... I was looking him right in the eyes when it happened. Laughed a little too hard. I could feel my face drop than I just slowly got up and tried to be cool abt it. Rip. You‚Äôre not alone in this. I hope the day is better to you.

Can‚Äôt help my apathy lately) Almost every app on my phone has a notification i need to get rid of. my sink hasn‚Äôt been empty in weeks. Just took my first shower in 2 weeks last night and relapsed w sh. Relapsing w disordered eating issues too. I need to get my life together. yikes
EDAnonymous,ev0y42n,t3_chvb45,1564148834.0,"YES. I typically will do the elliptical at the gym and I have to be burning 10 cals for every minute. So if I exercise 30 mins I need at least 300 cals. If I find myself at, let‚Äôs say, 320 cals at the end of the 30 mins, I will push for 350. If that brings me over in time I‚Äôm like ‚Äúmight as well get to 40 minutes, 400 cals.‚Äù
I can‚Äôt even take breaks in my sessions. If i stop long enough to lose my numbers I get really peeved and it feels like that whole workout was wasted. 
There have been so many times where I‚Äôve had to pee 5-10 minutes in but wouldn‚Äôt let myself stop til I got to 30+ minutes because that‚Äôs always my minimum."
EDAnonymous,ev0sh9u,t1_euxmpxe,1564145700.0,SAME HERE. I have zero spatial awareness with my whole body but especially my hips and always run into things with them. I just never know how much space I actually take up.
EDAnonymous,ev0rxn9,t1_eux0g5u,1564145377.0,I‚Äôve been on T for about 8 months and it has definitely reduced my hip size!! But I still have about a 2 size difference between my hips and waist

I think working in an office, especially one that does weight loss competitions is extremely triggering for someone with an ED. 
last year, before I even knew I had an ED (or maybe was just denying it like I am now) I was working in an office and one of the first things my coworkers said to me when i got hired was ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to put a lot of weight working here! all we do is sit all day!‚Äù As someone who was already very cautious about my weight and actively losing weight, I took this as a challenge. I used being sedentary as an excuse to fast. I wouldn‚Äôt eat for 3-5 days at a time sometimes. Walked the stairs and circled the buildings on my breaks for exercise. Had a strict rule where I wouldn‚Äôt eat at work at all, despite the constant offer for free food. Bitchy comments 24/7. It was a mess. 
There was also always a ‚Äúbiggest loser‚Äù competition that lasted 8 weeks with a 2-4 week break between each. I never did it because I didn‚Äôt want to waste my money. May rolled around and I was determined to lose weight for summer. I joined. It was $50 to enter, 6 people did it so the winnings were at $300. No fucking way I‚Äôm losing that. 
Needless to say I lost 40 lbs in 2 months and won the competition. I quit a week later. 
Now that I sit back and think about it, I spent my entire time there in a really sick and dark place. And the office-lady-weight-loss culture really fueled me too. 
(I‚Äôm in a better place now, I work a job where I‚Äôm active so I allow myself to eat more, though it usually turns to binging and sometimes purging, but at least I can walk straight without seeing stars!!)"
