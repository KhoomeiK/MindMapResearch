My armchair psychology theory is that a combination of past trauma and support you have/have had during trauma are huge factors. 

For example,  have had several very large traumas and very little support (abusive family,  few friends) 

I'm pretty sure that between the trauma from abuse, the other major traumas, the way I have been treated when people find out,  and the fact that I've had no one to turn to in any of this made me very prone and almost damned to end up with it.

I think I've had a lot of symptoms for a long time,  but I think the major trauma I had at the end of last year totally broke my brain,  if that makes sense. 

 I also think it depends on a lot of things, genetics, environmental factors, etc,  and none of these factors on their own are really able to determine whether or not somebody develops PTSD.  You basically hit the opposite of a lottery on this one if you have PTSD. 

 I'm probably all over the place in this but I hope it helps."

I was also born with a physical disability so that added a lot of stigma and made everything harder.   People see my wheelchair and assume that I am also in some way mentally deficient, so I had that to contend with as well.

I've also picked up a lot of creative pursuits over the years, now I can't finish my projects and I can't handle full on college either.

ptsd,ffyu3s0,t3_evrjp3,1580355173.0,I'm still living in the situation that caused most of my trauma.  My memory is trash and is only gets worse as I get more traumatized. I honestly hope it's fixable but I'm scared.
ptsd,ffynt6g,t1_ffyh1mt,1580350834.0,"Sounds good man, I'm glad I could help! Feel free to reach out any time! Keep me updated if you can. Again,  I'm sorry you have to go through this. I know its hard,  but this is probably the best thing you can do for him."
ptsd,ffx5o8h,t3_evi49d,1580318280.0,"Hello, I'm not the spouse of someone with PTSD.  I have it myself.  

  Mine is from various types of trauma including long term abuse.  I still live in the situation that contributed to it.

 I tell you this because although I've been struggling with it for years  I'm only now starting to admit what a struggle it is. It's a gradual process and you kind of have to hit rock bottom to get there.  Many of us who have PTSD don't really want to admit how bad it is or how traumatized we actually are, but deep inside we feel completely broken. I can't tell you how many times I've sat up at night thinking things like, ""I am broken,"" ""I am weak for having PTSD"" ""my brain is broken"" ""I'll never be right"" etc.  There's a ridiculous amount of shame that comes with it,  and once we realize it's there we hate what we've become. 

 I've had to drop out of college, I've self medicated with marijuana and briefly with alcohol ,  I've made reckless decisions that put me through more trauma because I couldn't take my situation anymore, etc.

   In September 2019 after my most recent trauma, I did hit rock bottom.   Hitting rock bottom was simultaneously the best and worst thing that ever happened to me.   I rethought everything in my life, and realized that my PTSD was ruining my life and especially my relationships. 

  I realize now that I have a pattern of unwittingly hurting people that may only be trying to help me.   Although I have always felt guilty when I realized I said or did something that I shouldn't have, it was only last year that I fully realize how poor my interpersonal skills are and how many FLEAS I've picked up from abuse.

   I am now slowly crawling out of the hole that I've been in for several years and it's been a slow and painful process. I'm working on getting to a point where I can get myself out of here and have the opportunity to heal.  I will not make any attempt at having a close relationship with anyone until I feel stable enough to know that I won't be abused again ( that's also a common thread with my close relationships) and I won't hurt anyone else.  

   If I were you, I would take a step back. You can only help a person that wants help and you should not have to take any kind of abuse from him.  I think you guys need to talk and you need to set some boundaries. Definitely talk to him about more counseling and PTSD help as well but my main concern is you. You can still support him if you so desire but you need to make sure you are not hurting yourself in the process.  Do you have anyone you can stay with until things are figured out?  I think if you step back a little bit it might help him realize that he's doing something wrong.

  I had a friend of mine step back recently, not because I was emotionally abusive but because my trauma and struggles were a bit overwhelming for her. I respect that she stepped back and I'm glad she did because I would rather her take time to take care of herself than worry about saving me.  I could have kept more of my raw emotion to myself,  I could have put it in the audio journal my therapist is having me do.  My friend stepping back showed me that I still need to iron out my coping skills more, if that makes sense.  

 We might not realize we are hurting or overwhelming people at the time, but we're usually grateful, as hard as it is the hear when someone is honest with us about it.

 My situation is probably very different from your husbands because I am not a vet and I have very little support in my real life, but I hope this helps and thank you for taking the time to read it.

 I'm very sorry you're dealing with all this."

I'm excited for when I finally get the chance to be a fully independent adult although I'm also scared because everyone tells me adult ing sucks. It's nice to know that it's probably going to be easier for me than my actual childhood was."
CPTSD,ffv2xol,t3_evc00u,1580254452.0,"Thank you for this! I think a lot of mine is from childhood but I'm 22 and I've sufferered a lot of trauma in adulthood as well.  You have no reason to feel guilty, I'm glad that your childhood was OK and it might help you with healing in the long run.  I'm sorry that you had something so traumatic happen to you in your adulthood but you are just as valid as the rest of us."
