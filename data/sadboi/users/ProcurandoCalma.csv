The times she ""let me"" there were always comments. ""Don't you want to cut it? You look soo much nicer with short hair!"" or straight out ""Your hair looks so shaggy!"" or something of the like.

All the way to adulthood, she kept on with this, nagging, commenting, wanting to pay for hairdresser.

At a birthday in her late years, I actually cut my hair as a ""birthday gift"" for her, just because I did not know any other way to hear any nice comments about myself and did not want, at least that, to be yet another reason for her to say something negative about me at the party...

On to your question. Well.. only the non physical stuff, like manipulation and gaslighting, control, mental mindgames

But no, all the stuff that happened, I know it happend, I have proof it happend -and because I know that, I now know I don't have to hide it, be ashamed of it, I don't have to play mindgames with myself over this. I just accept it. When I let go of the fear, my mind is more clear -but I will never forget.

While in my ptsd I was questioning everything, and especially because I have had a covert narc mother (and father) who treated my traumas like they never happened. Even me becoming homeless was not a big deal for them, they were just saying I should pretend not being homeless around them and their friends, I should pretend not having my ptsd, pretend I did not have healtcare problems. Everything would be fine then, and I would be loved, but only when I was with them. Yeah right..

Well, now, I don't care anymore, I tell people out loud what happend to me, with a calm behaviour. And guess what, nobody has power over me anymore. And speaking out has helped with my realitycheck, listening to my own voice telling about all the episodes. Writing them down. Actually drawing a few of them.

I will not run and hide anymore, I will not question myself about what I know is true. I will stand up for myself. Nobody can ever again put this baby in the corner -that is how the story goes now.

I'm still with no home of my own, but I have a calm head and a calm mind now -and I think everything will turn out..hopefully..ok!"

When I did not talk, they all ""blamed"" me, looked at me as the ""black sheep"", after I started to talk they saw reality for what it was. It was not about talking shit about the narcs, but rather telling about the episodes that happened.

The thing is, some of the narcs in my life were covert, they were not the ones screaming at me (well, my mum used to, but she calmed down over the years), they did it all (manipulation, berating, controlling, gaslighting) ""under cover"". So when I finally lost it, screaming at them, then I felt like I was the abuser. And I would say ""I cannot stay in this situation, because then I become the abuser, I will have to leave now, walk away"" And it was not until I was able to speak about it in a calm way in front of them with others in the room, that they could not hide. Once that happened, they knew I was not scared anymore, they knew I was telling the truth and could not deny this in front of other people like they would do in private -so in that moment, they lost their power, and knew they could never get it back.

I have experienced both and after my reactions from PTSD started to be ok after 5 years, I was still left with CPTSD, and it was much harder to explain. I am/have been homeless and have not had the therapy that it would have been nice to have had, so a few times I have trusted friends to listen to my story, and yes even though I have had physical trauma, it's not always what you want to talk about -but when talking about CPTSD and narcs, people get confused and immediately go to ask about what physical stuff happened. Don't know what I want with this reply, actually I have stopped using the terms somewhat now when I am not so much ""out of my skin"" anymore, people just think I'm the crazy one anyways.

Let go, let go, let go, let goooo! (That's when the magic happens!)

You learn how to take a good photo and then you try your best to forget, because it's not about taking the best photo, it's about reaching out with your camera in a moment where you see something that matters, something you feel and think ""wow, I cannot let this one go""

Why on earth are you taking pictures of things you don't care about? It sounds like you are taught only the theory, the static -not how to connect with emotion.

No wonder you don't have fun! My whole idea with loving photography is that I love to use my camera for telling a story, or for capturing emotion, and yes sometimes to capture an insane geometric-synchronization too.

I'll give you an assignment -if you want to do it of course:

Go take 24 pictures of ""in between"". And make 5+ of them be of people. What is ""in between"", what is that? Do you see it? Right there in between? In between those things, what is it that I see? Not over, not under, not to the side -in between (""the lines"" maybe?). What? I can bearly figure it out, or hmm, I see it clearly actually. Right there -you see it too?

In more innocent days (sorry, I don't have a home, have had ptsd, and I am struggeling with an illness on top of it all, different life now) -I was having a burn-out while studying. The year before when i was in art-school as my first year of being a late student (had a car accident when I was younger) I was again hit by a car, and I also had an abortion, and I was supporting a girl through the loss of her boyfriend. I did not make it through the year before I fell out, and went to bed. No finished papers from this school. And after that followed three years of depression, the start of my ten years with anxiety (wich is almost over now). Yeah, no matter the rest of the story right here in this post.

\-I made a small figurine of a person sitting ""in the corner"", of clay, that year, that I brought home. I was very ""infantalized"" and took it home like a girl coming home from kindergarden. But for me, the part of  me that I had low connection too, that figurine was representing my burn-out, my shame, my low self-confidence, low self-love. I thought I ""had"" to bring home for ""show and tell"" even though it was very personal for me. I still did not have an identity on my own. 

My mom put it on the kitchen shelf. At first, I just looked at it. Then it was there every time I came home.

I told my mother, ""can you please take it away, can I take it to my old room? It reminds me of bad times (wich were still bad) and I don't feel comfortable with it here right now""

""Oh, but it's soo nice! I like it so much!""

""But.. mum... please?""

2years later

""What do you say? No, I never heard that. Maybe you mentioned something. But, go now to get that table cloth for me, and watch the potatoes!""

I was 25-26 years old, and for many years I would look at it when I was visiting after that, trying to overlook it, telling her again -but she always said either that she did not remember, or liked it so much (and there for it should stay..)

I removed it myself... when I was what 36..?

That's the thing, when you listen to the covert ones, they say it too -they're just predending not to be the big bear, they choose to be the wolf in sheeps clothing instead.

I would like to add that I actually thought there was nothing wrong in coming back and caring for them when they were older, but I did not think it was right to say ""you should never go away because you will stay with us until you will take care of us"". I thought in my naive thoughts that I could go out for a while, be young and happy, feel freedom, become independent, get educated, -and yes then come back, live happy close to home, and yes -take care of them.
