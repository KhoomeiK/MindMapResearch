Unexplained,fp171kt,t1_fp14bqn,1588226226.0,"You would be surprised at how well light can shine through even the smallest cracks given the right angle and intensity. Not to discount your experience in any way, but I would thoroughly consider the possibility that it was a laser pointer (or some other form of focused, high-intensity light) before anything else. Especially since you stated that the light was seen on a window in another room (which suggests to me that it had outside origins).

Id like to share with you an experience I had many years ago: I remember when I was a bit younger I woke up to find a strange object on the floor next to my bed. It was round, appearing to glow with some strange, dim light, and had an almost otherworldly texture to it. From my perspective, it didn't seem like it belonged in the real world. It was like my brain couldn't really comprehend it. I sat in bed, terrified, until I decided I couldn't sit in fear over it any more and got up to investigate. When I approached it, it was like a switch went off. The confusing object I had been looking at suddenly transformed into a simple plastic trash can that had tipped over next to my bed. The moonlight outside was illuminating it in an odd way, and from where I was sleeping it made it look very strange. The whole experience reminded me a lot of those 2D optical illusions you often find in books, where a 3D image will pop out if you can trick your brain into seeing it.

I share this story only to say that our perception is not always accurate. Our brains do their best to make sense of the world around us, and sometimes they get it wrong. Perhaps my story holds some truth to what you experienced, or perhaps not. Either way, I hope you are able to find a good explanation for what happened!"

stevenuniverse,fkgk4jb,t3_fid8ig,1584162351.0,"For a lot of people, the ""corruption"" theory is now more of a ""shapeshifting"" theory. Basically, the idea is that at some point, Steven's mental state becomes so cracked that he shapeshifts into a monster. This is consistent with what we've seen before: Steven changing his age based off of how he views himself, him growing uncontrollably in response to stress, as well as him turning into the cat monster. We know from these situations three things: Steven is capable of shapeshifting into something non-human, he can grow extremely large, and his mental state can cause him to shapeshift uncontrollably.

Now, why would Steven become a monster in the first place? My guess is that something is going to happen in the next few episodes that causes him to spiral even further and to the point where he views himself as a monster. Perhaps he accidentally hurts someone he cares about in one of his emotional rages? It's certainly possible, especially with all of the new information we've been getting about how destructive pink diamond could be. Steven likely views his mom in a very negative light because of this, and in turn fears that he himself might be destructive as well. If something were to happen to confirm these fears, it could be the straw that breaks the camel's back.

The name ""corruption theory"" is pretty confusing, especially considering how the theory has evolved. I hope this clears some of it up!"

stevenuniverse,fkg0020,t3_fia0kn,1584146587.0,"Agreed. though I don't think it will be ""corruption"" in the traditional sense (i.e. animalistic, incapable of reverting without help).

Like what occured in those situations, he will be capable of turning back to normal, it will just require a lot of self-reflection and help from the people he loves."
stevenuniverse,fkfyfhq,t1_fkfxcn3,1584145513.0,"The show is about emotion, yes, but it wouldn't be much of a story if those emotions weren't represented in some visual way. Steven universe has always had some physical conflict playing out alongside the emotional conflict at the climax. The fact that Steven is turning pink/growing at all is some serious foreshadowing. It's not any stretch of the imagination to think that Steven is capable of morphing into a monster due to his emotional/mental state. Size is not an issue (as we have just learned), and as we saw in the original show he is more than capable of morphing into something non-human (his cat blob form)."
stevenuniverse,fkfx2qt,t1_fkfw3aw,1584144595.0,"There is no rule saying Steven HAS to be glowing. We don't know what his emotional state would be if he were to become said wormy boi. The glowing could be one manifestation of his mental state, while the monster is another. 

I don't think the show will take the nightmare route either. There would be nothing at stake in that case. Clearly the show is foreshadowing something major happening to Steven, and he's going to need the help of everyone else in order to get through it. How would anyone be able to do that if it's all happening in his head? Why would it be shown alongside all the other ""villains"" in the intro?"

BeardLovers,fcbocpw,t1_fcbe4pz,1577589167.0,"I understand your disagreement with my first comment haha. Tbh I was trying to summarize a point made in the video I linked, though looking back I realize I didn't paraphrase it so well. Essentially, I was trying to show that the total accumulated nuclear waste does not produce such disasterous or unmanageable amounts of radiation. Nuclear waste disposal/storage is a much more nuanced issue, however completely doable in practice. 

But yeah, I highly recommend the video! It's pretty insightful and she words her arguments far better than I ever could lol"
BeardLovers,fc921bi,t3_egqujg,1577545760.0,"If we were to take all of the nuclear waste on planet Earth, dump and spread it evenly throughout the entire ocean, the radiation at any particular point would not be strong enough to harm even a single organism. The fears surrounding radiation are largely overblown, and yet our most progressive politicians and activists often buy into the fear and rally against one of the safest, most efficient, and most cost-effective forms of energy production we have today.

Climate models have shown that the most effective way to combat climate change is to take an integrative approach to energy production: utilizing solar, wind, hydroelectric, and *especially* nuclear. We simply could not get to where we need to go without it.

The problem of the disposal of nuclear waste is often brought up in arguments against nuclear energy, however this is a relatively easy problem to solve. The biggest issue now is that the nuclear energy industry is dying out, and companies simply can't afford to dispose of the waste properly. They encapsulate the spent cores in thick layers of concrete and leave them on-site (which is still safe), and this only stirs up more fear in people who don't understand radiation.

The other issue is of course the fear of a nuclear meltdown. Shows like ""Chernobyl"", though it is an excellent show, often exacerbate this fear. The more recent nuclear disasters, 3 mile island and fukishima, were bad of course, but not as bad as people think (in terms of overall impact on the environment). Going forward people need to understand that the likelihood of another nuclear disaster is incredibly slim, and advancements in nuclear reactor/facility design have come a long way. 

I will leave this video here by a YouTuber called ""Unnatural Vegan"". She goes into excellent detail explaining the arguments against nuclear energy and then expertly dismantles them:

https://youtu.be/u8_u5TqnznA

It frustrates me to see so few progressive people in support of nuclear energy. To me, it is a testament to how powerful fear can be, and how easily people are willing to shut their eyes and block their ears when the science goes against what their irrational fears tell them. When we buy into our fears about nuclear energy, we are failing in the fight against climate change, putting our planet, and in turn us, at risk.

*Edited for further clarificatiin"
BeardLovers,fc5lnxg,t3_egapbs,1577460895.0,"When you are working on something you love or are passionate about, the energy you expend on said task is returned in the form of satisfaction, the feeling of personal accomplishment, pride, and confidence. When you do not love the work that you do, or when the passion you used to have dies out for whatever reason, the energy you expend returns nothing. You grow mentally and emotionally exhausted and fall into a sort of depression-like state that we all know as ""burnout.""

I have experienced this a lot in college. I initially chose my program because I thought I was passionate about a certain field, and felt my program was the best way for me to enter said field. Over time, I have slowly learned that the type of work my field offers just doesn't suit me. I've lost all passion I had for that field, and that passion has transferred to subjects so wildly different from what I am studying now that I cannot justifiably switch without sacrificing years of already spent time, money, and energy. So I keep at it, putting in tons of energy to do well in school while feeling little to no pride in what I am able to accomplish. I've been stuck living in a state of ""burnout"" for a while now. 

The solution, for me, has been to focus on my passions in whatever capacity I can. Having a hobby to do in my spare time really helps, as well as reading books/watching documentaries that interest me. Sometimes it's very difficult, and I still have two classes left before I can finally have the freedom to make any big changes, but I'm hopeful that I can find a path in life that suits me and won't ever have to experience extreme burnout ever again."
