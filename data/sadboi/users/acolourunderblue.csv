relationship_advice,fmgqchg,t3_fusxgt,1586055052.0,This might be a little controversial but you decided to have the baby without his permission. I believe it should be a decision between 2 people. First mistake. You‚Äôve done it anyways. Now you are being selfish and depriving your daughter a father now that he is at an age he is mature enough to be a father. Stop being selfish and think of your daughter. Also I don‚Äôt think he was abusive at the start he was just reacting to the fact that she didn‚Äôt care what he wanted. I would have sent a message like that too

MaleDatingStrategy,f62449m,t1_f623d1v,1572652986.0,Well it definitely comes across that way in your post. I think your religious background will stop you from being a good fit with a lot of women. I would say your best chance is finding someone with similar values to you. Good luck to you
MaleDatingStrategy,f623598,t1_f622osv,1572652449.0,"You are allowed to have a preference. But the way you state it comes across that all you care about is how many people she‚Äôs slept with. What kind of qualities do you want in a woman? I personally wouldn‚Äôt use the term high value or quality. It sounds like you think you‚Äôre better than others. People are different, of course you can have a preference of different qualities in women."
MaleDatingStrategy,f622014,t3_dqakbe,1572651821.0,It‚Äôs pretty obvious you are not ‚Äòhigh value‚Äô by your post. Devaluing a woman because of how many people she has slept with is not a good start. I would say your religious beliefs and values will only allow you to date woman who have similar beliefs which is a small percentage.
