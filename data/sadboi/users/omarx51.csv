FortNiteBR,eqgbgtg,t3_bydi1a,1560034048.0,">Shotguns are sooooo balanced 

This is actually not true, combat shotgun is WAY more OP than the pump was although it was one shot kill it was so slow, with the combat it hits for ~80 per shot and it's way faster, the tac is disadvantageous as it has less damage per shot and less range"

For the last part, if a child knows that there is a punishment for breaking a plate. He would try his best not to break it. Therefore, you get rewarded for doing good things and you get punished for doing bad things. So you mean after all, Hitler did, he wont get any punishment? After all the people he killed ,he will just rest in peace?! And I want to add on something, you believe that all of our universe, all the planets, all the galaxies just came from nowhere?"

For example: If I am a big mafia, I have money and power and police work for me , and I steal money from people. Why would I ever stop doing that? This question answers that there must be a punishment for whoever is doing wrong things and there must be a reward for whoever is doing right things. You could say that police will catch me but I am big mafia police cant stop me, you can say someone can kill me, but I have power and bodyguards. This is just an example of what life is. You avoid doing bad things because there is an punishment. Hope you understood my point."
