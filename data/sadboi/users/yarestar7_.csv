Vent,fp18iqu,t3_gao1kq,1588227478.0,"Don't be scared of getting yourself taken away from them. It'll probably be the best thing that's ever happened to you. Please find a way to tell your therapist. You don't deserve to be treated this way. Getting away from your shitty family should be your goal, please don't kill yourself, you have a great life ahead of you & you won't need them in your future."
AskReddit,fnv9qbe,t3_g3xrji,1587285206.0,"When I was in 1st grade, there was this teacher who would constantly make fun of a student because he went to school in dirty uniform. He was a bit clumsy and the teacher would call him out for any little mistake he made including sloppy hand writing. He encouraged the whole class to call him a pig and make ""Oink Oink"" noises at him. During this age, we didn't really know how wrong this all was and we all went along with what the teacher encouraged us to do. The kid eventually moved away and we all forgot about it as time passed. This memory came back to me not that long ago at my age of 26 years old. I am now a mom of a first grader and the thought of what we did to this poor kid still haunts me and breaks my heart. I hope the kid turned out okay wherever he is and if I ever see him again I would apologize deeply and hug him."

depression,erx28ax,t3_c4ggxq,1561368096.0,"Not a lesbian here but honestly I am way happier living away from my parents. My mom was verbally abusive and I can relate in a way. Move out, find a roommate and dont hate your life, you will meet other ppl that will treat you better than your own family. They will eventually come back around and even if they don't, you don't need their negativity in your life. Find happiness elsewhere & within yourself! Best wishes and hugs!"
