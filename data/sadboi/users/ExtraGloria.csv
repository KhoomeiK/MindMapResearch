Alright important points

*STRENGTHEN DON'T STRETCH* is your mantra, you improve mobility and ROM through strengthening for the love of God avoid over stretching in pigeon pose. This is how I recieved my worst physical injury in terms of pain 

*STATIC STRETCHING IS CONTRAINDICATED* 
     -> careful dynamic and isometrics are where it's at

- don't tough out pain. Not worth the risk of injury

- slow, progressive loading. We're going to take longer than other people working at the same thing. That's fine, compete against yourself, not others .

- isometrics in end range is good to facilitate proprioception to prevent joint injuries and strengthening the joints directly

*PLYOMETRICS ARE CONTRAINDICATED*"
