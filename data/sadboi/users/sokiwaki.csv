titanuprising,evavwyd,t1_ev8shcr,1564358714.0,"From what I've seen the Astrid duties don't work if it involves a specific colour dragon (including the dragon of each colour duty).

It's definitely frustrating, I've also gone from two chests a day to two chests total since the update."
titanuprising,esl9o3j,t1_esl8ia0,1562081752.0,"I have a discord for my clan as well but very few people use it.

Mine is very casual too. Not everyone plays every day. Sometimes we defeat the alpha, sometimes we don't. That's ok for me. Not everyone wants or has time for the intensity of a bunch of rules and demands. It's still a game at the end of the day, not a job.

Every clan is different and different structures will work for different people. Make your clan what you want it to be."
titanuprising,esl6q5c,t3_c89ftf,1562080219.0,"Remove them.

I agonised over this as well but ultimately I rationalised it this way - this game, unlike some others, does not give any clan-wide rewards. If someone doesn't participate in the alpha battles, they don't get rewarded when the alpha is defeated. Being in a clan without participating confers absolutely no benefits to the player. However it does negatively affect the rest of the clan since it will limit their ability to defeat higher level alphas."

titanuprising,es821se,t3_c5iw4e,1561686000.0,You could also try dropping the blue and using Flanktanker instead. Flanktanker's healing has been really useful for me in those levels. I'm around the same point. 43/51.
titanuprising,eryjyug,t3_c4syfn,1561410259.0,"In addition to what everyone else has said, Muck & Tumble aren't a bad option if that's who you end up with. Flank Tanker is better in my opinion, but sometimes the best dragon is whichever one you end up with a duplicate of.

I recently stopped trying to breed any four star greens (Revenger, Fendmender, Copsekeep) because I'm pretty close to getting Barf & Belch and their ability seems more than worth the wait. Especially versus alphas."
titanuprising,erwbg04,t1_ervrpcj,1561338680.0,"Their level isn't high enough to breed five star dragons yet though but agreed, start breeding with Sawmaw as soon as possible."
AMA,erh7rbd,t1_erewcl1,1560869235.0,"This has been my experience as well. For me it was diet-related. I never said anything to anyone, just made the changes almost overnight. Talking about it or planning for it never seems to work."
RiseOfBerk,epupeg4,t1_epukqdd,1559513446.0,"I can think of a few reasons.

1. Even for a trivial change like that it takes time and time is money.  
2. People would already be used to each dragon in a given block. Rearranging them may cause minor confusion.  
3. It's not broken."
RiseOfBerk,epuk8iq,t3_bw21u6,1559510989.0,"It's probably the order they were released in the game. There were only four legendaries in the game when that bit of UI first got introduced so the original grid of four. Drago's Bewilderbeast and the Purple Death came one after the other, so those two got added to the grid. And Shellfire is the most recent addition.

Many people probably do already have the Purple Death and not the Shellfire because by the time those two came around they had already unlocked most if not all of the other legendaries. For people new to the game, they can work on the statue requirements for Shellfire from quite early on, so it's possible they will unlock Shellfire before the last of the other Legendaries."
