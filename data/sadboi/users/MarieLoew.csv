AmItheAsshole,fqtr0ef,t3_gkpzrv,1589644411.0,"NTA, but I do get where he may be coming from. I'm not a native English speaker dating a Brit, and when I ask ""do you want x"" he often replies ""go on then"" which to me sounds like ""not really but if it makes you happy I'll endure x"". It upset me a lot for a while, cause I thought he didn't like a lot of things I did for him. Eventually I asked him, and he explained that that's just a way to say ""yes please"" in England, and having met his friends and family now, yes, it's a very common and nice phrase.

Possibly your partner is just for some reason used to ""sure"" not being the most polite of responses, but his way of dealing with that is definitely an asshole move. Just hoping I could show you a different perspective here."

relationship_advice,foq07kg,t3_g8tjek,1587978218.0,"Hey there, coming from a couple also in a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom appt. I'm working an essential job **and** studying from home, while my partner lost his job and has no education he's pursuing, so basically same boat but opposite side of it.  


We're both home 24/7 now, and he's trying his best to not get depressed over losing his income/ability to pay rent, so he spends a lot of time just playing videogames and watching TV and generally being leisurely.  


I've had to ask him to be very quiet when I study from home, because it just takes a **lot** of focus to read scientific articles for my papers and I can't have sounds around me, normally I work in the university's library which is closed now.  


He's very understanding, and just takes a lot of walks (walking outside alone is allowed in our country), or gets groceries if we need any. When I have a good, high focus day, I tell him to please be however loud he needs, and then I just ask him to turn it down if it distracts me too much. I basically just tell him my boundary until we both hit that sweet spot where we can do what we want to do without getting in each other's way.  


I've also lost a lot of my libido during this time, and he's been very understanding. We don't have sex during the day at all because it's work-time, and we may when I have an easy day, but usually we don't have sex until the evening. I think what helps me bump up my libido, is knowing that sex is not a requirement in our relationship. We tend to spend a lot of time watching a show we like together, we always have meals together to just talk about what we're up to.  


When I finish working and just wanna browse Reddit or watch YouTube alone, he doesn't interrupt me knowing I need to recharge as well. However, he never asks for these times to recharge, probably because he gets them when I'm out for work, and because he's generally not using up a lot of mental energy since he's basically relaxing all day.  


We had some arguments before we came to this balance, I felt annoyed a lot but it took me a while to realize why. I explained that it's hard for me to work when I'm constantly being reminded of how much he's relaxing, which is when we agreed on this set-up. Sometimes he just browses Reddit or reads his social media to seem productive just to give me a feeling of being in a productive working environment.  


Of course this does require a lot of talking, I make sure he's happy with our set-up, and if he wants to divert he'll also ask me, the result is he doesn't feel imprisoned in a house without a purpose, and I can do my work and relax. I hope my perspective gave you some insight in what it can be like for people in the same boat."

dyspraxia,fnodx9f,t3_g2bdtv,1587121862.0,"In my experience, it is hard to know how to be good and helpful for my dyspraxic partner. Because he is so used to things being harder for him, he works very hard to be as functional as he can be, and tries to never ask help because he thinks if no one else asks help on something, he should be able to do it without help too. Sometimes I recognize his struggles, and give him advice. Half the time, he loves the help as if I opened a door to some forbidden knowledge he has always needed. Other times he feels like I'm patronizing him, and gets very frustrated.  


From reading this subreddit I learned that dyspraxia can come somewhat in waves. So you can have a day where everything is immensely hard, and days where everything goes well and is easy. I suppose that goes for everyone, but maybe it hits a bit harder for dyspraxics, since if something is hard for everyone, it may be even harder for someone with dyspraxia. I can imagine, on a hard, frustrating day, people are more prone to lashing out, and may just wanna sulk in their bad day rather than being reminded outwardly that their struggles are actually visible. This is understandable and communication is important to recognize this and stay nice to each other.  


In short, no matter how consistent I try to be towards my partner, sometimes he may appreciate my help a lot, other times he resents it. But the thing that keeps things working, is the fact we communicate about this, and he sees that even on his off days, all I want to do is just be there for him and help him. If you have trouble with how to perceive how people treat you, I suggest telling them, and seeing where they're coming from. If you still disagree with them after hearing their side, tell them, hope they learn and grow from it.  


If you're talking about strangers being dicks about dyspraxia, they're just uneducated, and if they don't wanna learn, that's their loss and it will bite them in the butt later so don't let it wind you up. :) <3"

I've never had a good relationship with my dad, he abused my mom, brother and me a lot mentally and physically. After many years of trying to improve the relationship, I gave up because it hurt too much. He wouldn't invite me to Christmas, his new wedding (or even inform me he was remarrying), and still managed to pretend I'm a shitty daughter for not visiting him more often.

Anyway, I told myself: if he wants to hang out, he's free to visit me anytime, but I'm done making steps towards him. The life insurance he and my (now deceased) mother had on me opened up, so he needed my signature to obtain the money. I did so, and accepted he may end up keeping it, he's never supported me financially since I moved out at age 18 and I'm 24 now so who cares. Guess what: he did give me the money. He's not my money bank though, I politely accepted and thanked him for saving so much for me. Had he kept it, even though it was always intended for me, I wouldn't have said a word. I don't care, I don't want to be his friend anymore since he never did a decent job for me either. The fact your daughter gets upset over you giving up is incredibly nasty. She should've seen it coming and definitely not count on you for funds if she doesn't even want anything to do with you. You did well, dont let anyone tell you otherwise!

I think on the one hand it really put me off from PDA, I'm very keen on just focusing on my friends when I'm with my SO somewhere, we have plenty of time to cuddle and whatever later. On the other hand it also gave me a bit focus on making my own friends and going out without my SO, because I don't think anyone should ever be guilted to be with me at all times. I'm happy about these behaviors.

Behaviors I'm less happy about, is the fact my parents were incredibly guilt trippy towards me, and I'm incresibly predisposed to feeling guilted into doing things.

relationship_advice,f8av72f,t3_dzus7n,1574413642.0,"I'm sorry that happened to you! We had a very similar situation in my shared living, so I hope this helps.

My new freshly from her parents housemate texted me to come into the livingroom where she was crying because another housemate randomly asked her for sex and insisted on asking when she said no. She was now terrified to be alone in the house with him, and didn't know what to do.

We took a few days to inform all our housemates because we live with 5 girls and 2 boys, and our girls are highly emotional and kinds fragile and I know that if this would happen to someone else and we wouldn't have warned them they'd feel very betrayed. I made sure to ask how it made everyone feel, and also kept asking the girl it happened to how she was feeling. I tried to neutrally tell the situation and not make our housemate into an ultimate bad guy, because on the one hand he's Indian and also first time living away from home (India, and we're in the Netherlands) so there may be some cultural misunderstanding and also it's damn hard to force someone out and he's generally really nice so we hoped that we could fix this ourselves.

Some housemates were very alarmed and admitted to me the noticed tension and didn't feel safe anymore. So I went and asked everyone when they're available to have a chat. Didn't tell him anything until we found an evening we're all available. Then I went up to him, told him that I was told what happened, and it's caused a tension in the house and we want to discuss it. I reminded him we don't hate him and we want a resolution where we can all live happily including him. To my surprise he immediately agreed.

We sit down, I ask the girl if she wants to explain what happened, I give everyone a chance to explain how hearing the situation made them feel (told them to not say the same thing over and over only add new information if you have it, again, it's not an attack) and then I let him explain why he did it. He seemed to indeed have some cultural misunderstanding where it's okay to randomly ask for sex as if it's a business deal, since Europeans are very open sexually. He also thought it'd be totally okay for him to hire prostitutes into his room because his room is private anyway. We explained that we weren't comfortable with him paying a stranger for sex because we felt like they may steal something, but he's free to get a gf or even bring a one night stand home anytime. He apologized and we said it was all good and never spoke of the incident again.

I've asked the girl a few weeks later how she felt and she said there was 0 tension and he never said or asked anything like it again.

The reason why this worked was because in general most of us are very close and care about the atmosphere in the house a lot. Even though we disagreed with his actions we wanted him to feel safe and understood too, anytime emotions seemed to bubble too high I silenced someone and made sure they worded themselves respectfully. The Indian guy is nice, he just made some wrong comments and I believe just the fact he knows everyone knows also helps him not try anything on anyone.

My suggestion if you want something like this too: try to have a mediator who doesn't have this experience and isn't too emotional about the situation. I wasn't very emotional over the situation, I'm a senior and know how to tell a guy to fuck off, I think this was very helpful.

Anyway, good luck!"

BPD,f7z3137,t1_f7z2tsa,1574104557.0,"That's great, nice job! Is there some way I can follow updates on this app and possibly use it in the future as well? :)"
BPD,f7z2w0p,t1_f7z13hd,1574104496.0,"Well, if you feel bad and you live together with someone or see someone very frequently and they ask you how you're doing, I think it is nice to try and tell them how you truly feel even if it's just admitting you feel bad and then say you don't feel comfortable telling them more than that. But that's just my opinion and you are completely free to take it or not. I hope you don't mind my unsolicited advice, since this post wasn't about that at all. Lots of love either way, stranger <3"
BPD,f7z0ltd,t3_dy6vjt,1574103501.0,"Honestly, I love this app already! Did you take into account something like ""amount of social interaction"", possibly ""type of social interaction"". To me it matters a lot, for example I have a very bad relationship with my dad but I can't always avoid interacting with him as I could with strangers since he's my dad. And there's other people I regularly see at my sports club who aren't my friends but I do interact with them a lot and they seem to affect me differently. Maybe another idea is rate the weather and amount of time spent outside because of winter depression factors. 

Another tip: I can imagine some people care more about certain factors than others. I know maybe this goes against the idea of your app as you want to take every factor into account to make it do crazy math and help you realize what is causing certain feelings, but if this is just some formula maybe it's possible to choose which factors to question. I don't think I want to tell the app every day how much water I consumed while other people may care. So I guess the tip is: definitely have a lot of pre-made suggested factors, but allow users to choose which do and don't go in the algorithm.

I don't have more advice as of now but I'm very interested in this app and would definitely use it if I could!"
BPD,f7yw930,t3_dy3d91,1574101657.0,"Another one that freaks me out: I have one housemate who is obviously depressed but I have an incredibly hard time talking to her because she denies feeling bad in any way and I can just feel it, I've never had anyone meet her and not directly ask me whats up with her.

Anyway, when she asks me how I'm doing, I'll reply and ask her how she's doing but I hate it everytime because she always acts like she's totally fine and I just want to tell her she's not and press her to tell me the truth. But at the same time I feel like she would tell me it she was comfortable enough at me and I also don't feel like I currently have the emotional capacity to help her anyway."

BPD,f71shpo,t3_du1z5c,1573347150.0,"The whole point isn't even making things difficult because of your disorder is it? You make things as equally difficult or easy for others as anyone else, but your disorder makes you question yourself nonstop and when anyone ""proves you right"" for your concerns you'll just hate yourself because it's obviously true you're horrible. :/ that's how it feels to me anyway"
relationship_advice,f5sdxe7,t3_dp33b9,1572425009.0,"Damn that's really annoying!! My dad housed a friend of his in our home for a while too. She had cheated on her husband so got kicked out. She never made an active effort to work she just got benefits for her ""bad back"" which I never understood how it stopped her from say, an office job, since she spent all her days playing Farmville anyways. My dad would work all day, I'd be in school, she'd be in my brother's old room on her computer all day. My dad would still clean the house and make dinner every day, and her contribution would be buying random Buddha house decorations which none of us really... Wanted.

He eventually kicked her out but he also kept up with that way too long to make sense, she was just leaching.. But at least she would kind of pick up after herself.

Your guest sounds worse, and not only that she also brings over kids which don't seem to have their manners in check either. I'm so sorry you're going through this and having your empathy toyed with. I hope you can get her to leave soon, so you don't have to deal with a family that isn't really yours anymore. Don't let them manipulate you and feel sorry, that lady is an adult and she needs to act it! Even if she made an active contribution to the house and didn't make it a mess and her kids were angels, it's still up to you to have her over or not man!"
LeagueOfDerp,f4zt8g9,t3_dmemr8,1571915443.0,"Heya, this sounds really cool! In ranked I mostly play otp lulu but I'm a decent support with rakan, Leona and Nami too and lately trying blitzcrank and bard. I'm trying to be more flexible with my picks but I often fall back to lulu because she's just my favourite solo queue but I'm willing to try new champions when I play with players I'm more comfortable with.

I'm silver 1, currently in promos to gold 4 so I'm in the category you're looking for as well. I'd love to have some regular playing schedule, I do have a very irregular schedule (school/work/personal life) but I'm generally able to plan 2-3 weeks ahead.

Pretty tilt proof too, I get really distracted around toxic players so I'd love to have a pre-made team :) 

My nickname on euw is Miepgirl if you wanna have a look."
