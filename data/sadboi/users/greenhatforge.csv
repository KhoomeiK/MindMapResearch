computer,flutrbe,t3_frbf69,1585509866.0,"Background Info:

I‚Äôve always had hand me down parts from my brother. 

Recently he upgraded so I received his older parts. 

Mobo: ASUS M5A99FX PRO R2.0 AM3+ AMD 990FX SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 
CPU: AMD FC 9590 8 Core
GPU: ASUS Dual Radeon RX480
RAM: 32gb
SSD - OS
1.5TB HD - Games
PSU: 750w Modular Unit

Recently I‚Äôve been gaming more due to the quarantine and I keep running into issues with the computer locking up. 

I removed the CPU and Cooler for fear that I accidentally messed up the install, so I reseated it and redid the thermal paste. 

In the process I bent one of the CPU pins, which I bent back into place but it was kind of barely hanging on. I‚Äôve been monitoring CPU temps when it does this and they reach about 180f when the crash occurs. Which doesn‚Äôt seem astronomical. It doesn‚Äôt always crash like this but when it does crash like this, when hard resetting, the BIOS does pop up with a CPU Overheating Temp Alert. 

I‚Äôve been reading the event viewer and crash reports and can‚Äôt find anything in there either.

PS. I cut my voice out... but apparently it‚Äôs still there. I originally sent this video to my brother and buddies I was playing the game with."
