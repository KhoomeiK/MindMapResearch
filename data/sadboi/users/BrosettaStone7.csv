Doctor, say that (tell your patients that) you made the hole out of anger when they (a previous patient) arrived with fallen brackets lol. I hope that they are cautious.

Hahahahaha I died (laughing). Maybe then they will cooperate!

Translations I thought the 2nd sentence could have been before using context:

1. Doc, tell the hole that it made it mad when they arrived with fallen brackets.
2. Doc, tell your patients that the hole made itself mad when they arrived with fallen brackets.
3. Doc tell your patients that the hole made itself, angrily, when they arrived with fallen brackets."

Questions

1. Why do you need the le in sacarle? Like who or what is the le here? Could you just say ‚Äúsacar‚Äù or ‚Äútomar‚Äù? And why ‚Äúal‚Äù, why not ‚Äúdel‚Äù?
2. Why the le on d√≠gale?  Could you just say ‚Äúdiga‚Äù or ‚Äúdi‚Äù?
3. How are you supposed to know who the ‚Äúle‚Äù is in d√≠gale and that she wasn‚Äôt speaking to the hole itself since ‚Äúese hueco‚Äù follows it immediately?
4. How do we know who is making/doing in ‚Äúhizo‚Äù?"
