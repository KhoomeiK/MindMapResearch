What is called unaware or unconscious is a state where the mind is inactive, so there is nothing to remember about it. Just as you cant remember anything in sleep (except dreaming).

I remember exactly that what happend before, but cannot recollect how i started to drown.

The physical death of the human body isnt your death.
There is this idea that you are the body. But if you think about it, it doesent even make sense.
The body itself is changing every second. Cells multiply, Hair grows, Blood circulates etc. Yet you always call this body: me
So if that would be you, what is with the hair that you cut and throw away? Is that also you? 
Where does this identification of you being the body even come from.
When ""you"" were a little baby, with no ability to think (as ""you"" simply didnt learn a language yet) you still existed, with no thoughts whatsoever and because there were no thoughts, you cannot remember anything of that time.
Same with deep sleep. Can you remember anything while sleeping (not dreaming)? You cant and yet you still existed.
There is really no difference between you and awarness.

That means you always exist, you always are in the present. There is no real afterlife, since life is all there is and awarness is the foundation of it.
Meaning life and awarness is absolutly the same. 

A simple example:
An apple tree has all sorts of different apples. What happens now is that this apple tree starts to imagine itself to be only an apple and because it now thinks it is an apple it sees differences among other apples. All of a sudden there is something outside.  But what really happens is that you look at yourself, because in truth you are still the entire tree."

A belief is something you have to hold in your mind. No matter what kind of belief it is, its mind made.

Therfor a belief is a standpoint of an invidual. It varies dependend to which person you talk to.

For example: A disabled person might not have the luxury to think in complex patterns. But does this mean that this person is incapable of seeing the truth? It doesent.

Because what im speaking of is something you dont need the mind to realize. 

To see a world already implies that there needs to be an awarness of it. Without awarness of a world, there is no world. There is absolutly nothing. That means that awarness is the prime factor for being alive, for life itself. Thoughts, the physical body and so on can only be realized as such when there is an awarness of them.

The mistake that is made is to ""think"" that this awarness is tight to a physical body. (Science already shows what a physical body isnt really physical, its made out of atoms and atoms are energy)

So it is always there. This counciousness is the foundation of everything and you are not that appearance that appears inside that counciousness but counciousness itself. Meaning you are everything.

If there are any questions left please ask

What it really comes down to is that there is really nothing to fear."

Every religion claims to be true and to some extend there is a truth to all of them. But its still a belief. Its something you hold in the mind. 

The truth is that no belief is needed. All you need is to realize your own current situation and one has to admit, that soly through this awarness of being alive right now in this very moment, something can even exist. Did you ever experience anything else than counciousness?

Even when the mind is not active, meaning no thoughts appear, there is still an awarness in the background. Once you experience a no-mind state you understand that you are not that person you belief yourself to be and you are not the mind either. That what dies cannot therfor affect you, because you are none of that to begin with.

In the end, you can see that for yourself. If there is nothing behind life, than this situation of yourself right now in this very moment would make no sense. The moment you are aware of anything already prooves self-awareness.

But they are not bound to give any further help. This isnt because they dont want to, but because their calender is full. A therapist only can have so much patients.

depression,f5lhw4z,t3_do6xod,1572278724.0,"Well there is some truth to it.

Ive seen people that lost literally everything and they still werent unhappy about that situation. They moved on. Such people i admire, because they dont let life circumanstances rule over them. Lets be honest. There is no perfect life and i think i dont know anyone who has that perfect past, where everything went their way. Even for rich people this is true. It might seem so from the outside, but its not true.

So what does this tell me? It tells me that happiness is not connected to the happenings in the world. It is only found within yourself. When you are happy, the world seems happy. When you are sad, the world seems sad.

Even with a depressive mind like mine (and im depressive most of the time) i do not forfeit this simple truth. Happiness is nothing to be gained. Its within you. Your thoughts make you think otherwise and they rule and destroy you, but if you dont let them rule over you, then peace is found. 

I think about suicide a lot and my mind gives me a lot of trouble, but i know its only bullshit. My mind literally soly spills bullshit all day long."
depression,f5k9q52,t3_do2bsj,1572258317.0,"Who am I, is basically the oldest and most important question.

The reason it cannot be answered fully with the intelect (and thats basically the reason why no one on this earth ever could formulate it.), is because the intelect (thoughts for that matter) is the problem for seeing it.

When you ask the Question: Who am I, than that question is directly aimed on yourself, which is the ""ego"". But the ""ego"" is in itself empty. Why? Because it is nothing more than thoughts. Thoughts always ""think about"" things and that is why they are incapable of solving the riddle about yourself. They always go outward, never inward.

To know ""who you are"" you need to become indifferent to thoughts or in other words dont become involved with them. Thats what meditation is all about. That is what people try to say over centuries after centuries.

To know ""who you are"" is a question only you can find. An intelect answer will always leave questions and will never satisfy. You have to see it for your self."

I went trough this experience for a couple of years, but eventually i dealt with it. As ive grew older and went to a different school i got myself respected for helping others that were treated like i once did. I also was in a position to shut down any bullying inflicted by others to some of my classmates. 

I really cannot believe it sometimes but standing your ground and show the wrongness what others do, earns you some respect. I never was bullied ever again.

So let me tell you, what seems unbearable (at times it is) will help you later to get out stronger. Take a college where a fresh start is possible and hold this goal. As long as you are in this highschool its tough, but you can work towards what i just said.

Some people let that take over completly (narcissist) and some find empathy for others. 

You say you want nothing in return, but in truth we all do want something. You want decency and compassion, which means you want people to give you something in return. I understand that. I also do that. In fact it makes me feel better to help others. (which is in itself self-serving again).

Personalities as you pointed out (something to work for) needs energy to uphold, because they are masks. Try being nice to others, without having expectations of them being nice in return. Then we are going somewhere, because then you ignore the ego for a bit. I know it sounds stupid and i sure would hope being treated nice is a given, but its uncontrollable.

The reason for that is that no one can formulate or describe what it means to be dead.

As you live, you fear the void. You fear that nothingness that might follow, because somehow you grew accustmed to this feeling of being alive as this person you are right now. You want savety, that death is not the end.

No one can fully answer what comes after it, but if you think ligically about it, the reason alone that you are alive right now, already should be confirmation enough that death cannot be the end.

b) You are uncomfortable to face the emotions that trouble you and are ebarassed that you have them. That can be things that seem unaccaptable in society and you rather not talk about it.

c) There is an overall emptiness, where life seems pointless, because you dont understand why you are here and why you should do all those things. This is both a helpful but a dangerous state. Helpful because you start to go into deeper uestions than the ordinary day to day life and dangerous, because your life can become suffering in the purest sense.

Men can look good until a very old age (something arround 70+)

Woman have the problem that their looks are determined by a smooth skin, which they compensate a lot with make up, until it is impossible to hide.

40 years is actually still an age where you can look sexy. Heck even 50.

Anyway, lets not forget that the body itself knows no number or age. He doesent say: Im 40 or whatever. Aging can have different effects on people and it can happen in a rather rapid or slower fashion dependend how healthy you live. 

And last but not least:

To identify with the body brings its own problems, no matter if you think you are beautiful or ugly. The sole reason you are always incomplete is with identification of something, especially the body. It is of no real importance in reality. Your happiness is not connected to it and thats exactly the reason why people that are disabled, have lost their arms etc still can be happy and mostly are.
