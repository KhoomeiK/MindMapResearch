So I‚Äôm fairly new to it, started at the beginning of January, although my partner says he has noticed a fairly vast difference in when I get upset and how long my emotional episodes last.

You are unique, and empathetic and self-aware. I think it‚Äôs unlikely that you‚Äôll be alone forever, but I also think if something upsets you, you have to allow yourself to feel the pain and then do your best to kick them out of your head. They don‚Äôt deserve the space they take up.

This way you‚Äôre hanging out with them but there‚Äôs much less pressure for conversation. It‚Äôs scary to feel like you‚Äôre losing people, but friendships end and sometimes it‚Äôs no ones fault, you just realize you don‚Äôt fit. If you need to isolate yourself, do so for a time, but dont wait for people to notice, everyone is so wrapped up in themselves, it‚Äôs hard for them to notice things like that.

Try to find a little comfort in that (yes, I know that‚Äôs hard, but it‚Äôs worth a shot). Also, I think we can conclude that these people were not invited to diminish your presence. It kind of sounds like inviting friends to share thanksgiving may be a family practice of theirs? Anyways, the intention is not to hurt you, but to try and make sure as many people have as good a holiday as possible.
