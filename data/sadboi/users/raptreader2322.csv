AskReddit,fink40p,t1_finjfmp,1582564786.0,"So it does connect with meditation but it is not completely about meditation. Meditation is just a good way to live in the moment and try not to focus on stressing about things that aren’t important at this time.

So I’m fairly new to it, started at the beginning of January, although my partner says he has noticed a fairly vast difference in when I get upset and how long my emotional episodes last. If nothing else, sitting in a room with a group of people like me is incredibly validating and keeps me from thinking I’m irreparable.

BPD,fi0roqi,t3_f5talg,1582043400.0,"I feel like people only see the person with bpd as the issue, but the truth is that everyone can be fucked up. The important thing for me is to find someone who sees past a diagnosis to the fact that there’s still a person inside. Try to be kind to yourself and remember that these people don’t know you. You are unique, and empathetic and self-aware. I think it’s unlikely that you’ll be alone forever, but I also think if something upsets you, you have to allow yourself to feel the pain and then do your best to kick them out of your head. They don’t deserve the space they take up.

Edit: just clicked into the other subreddit to see what it was like (I was studiously avoiding it). I regret everything, please block that from yourself if possible. Everyone deserves to feel and share their hurt but damn that was not a fun read"

Remember that we cannot know what other people are thinking and it will probably be a waste of your energy to try in this circumstance. Give yourself time to mourn the end of the relationship, put an expiration date on that time (like 3 days) and then do your best to move on without him. Don’t let him live rent-free in your head.

Unfortunately you have had a rough go through therapy, which sucks, but there could still be a therapy that will work for you. If no one covered DBT therapy with you, look into that for sure.

Now you can do some dbt to break down your thinking. You’re trapped in a cycle and when he says “I want to spend time with someone else” you only hear “I don’t want to spend time with you”. I would suggest making the time without him special for you. Maybe take a nice hot bath with a book, or go get a manicure if possible, or wander around a museum.

It’s often hard to take a minute to set down our insecurities and appreciate, yes I have a partner, no I don’t want him to leave so I’m going to freak out about the thing that scares me the most. And sometimes it’s okay, that happens. But holy shit woman, you’re a new mom, you’re recognizing when your mind is running away from you, and you’re requesting help when you think you need it.

But you can still invite other friends from the group to hang out. For low pressure situations, you could go to the movies, play some board games, go to a comedy show. This way you’re hanging out with them but there’s much less pressure for conversation. It’s scary to feel like you’re losing people, but friendships end and sometimes it’s no ones fault, you just realize you don’t fit. If you need to isolate yourself, do so for a time, but dont wait for people to notice, everyone is so wrapped up in themselves, it’s hard for them to notice things like that. Also, you have a whole community here and I feel pretty comfortable saying that we are all rooting for you. Be kind to yourself, you deserve it."

That being said-the fact that your partner’s friend and his sister’s friend will be there has nothing to do with the fact that you’re his chosen partner. He chose you for a reason. Try to find a little comfort in that (yes, I know that’s hard, but it’s worth a shot). Also, I think we can conclude that these people were not invited to diminish your presence. It kind of sounds like inviting friends to share thanksgiving may be a family practice of theirs? Anyways, the intention is not to hurt you, but to try and make sure as many people have as good a holiday as possible. And if you finish thanksgiving and are unhappy with how it went, is it possible you could host his family for a small get together to get to know them?
