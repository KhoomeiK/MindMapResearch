Richard Nixon and Margaret Thatcher are widely considered the most brainless politicians we ever had. I suppose we can add Trump to the list. Trump throwing hissy fits like a bitch can be considered ample evidence.
 
ExTJs have no personality would be a bit false, because everyone has a personality by definition, even annoying people have the personality of being annoying cunts. People high on conscientiousness and low on openness are usually considered as people with ""no fucking personality"".

We are better off answering the question ....  are ExTJs annoying cunts with OCD in surveys on r/ExTJ I suppose. But given how sensitive ExTJs are to mild criticism ... we should probably refrain from putting a finger in the bee's nest that directly.


Some survey questions we can ask

Do you feel fake ?   
Are you considered annoying ?    
Are you considered a boring person ?     
Are you considered a sociopath aka fake human being by others ?   
Have people recommenced that you should see a psychologist  ?

As these crops are more profitable, the producing countries, usually some third-world clusterfuck, use way too much land at the expense of basic needs of the local population. Things might be initially fine for the producing countries but as time goes on the local population starves, leading to revolts, uprisings and internal wars.

>Thee results of a meta-analysis research conducted in 1997, which consisted of 35 studies, indicated that there is a **very small**, but statistically significant positive correlation between Extraversion and g (r=.**08**)

Your projectile wall of molasses speaks for itself."

Apparently INFPs and INFJs have higher I.Q than ENTx .... so it is probably right to say ENTx are more stupid than INFx.

INTx have a slightly higher I.Q than INFx. 

INTx will have extremely low, I would even say embarrassingly pathetic E.Q  and I would wager that INFx would probably have a better E.Q than all the NTs 

So averaging out I.Q and E.Q INFx probably score higher than all NTs. And I'm sitting here and wondering why these witches play astrology games."
mbti,fhvwn7b,t3_f4zx80,1581902355.0,Statistics .... astrology for NTs.
mbti,fhuy56t,t1_fhs5g9a,1581891435.0,"Hmmm well, when I read your comment it reminded me of ExFJs I've met which seems to match op's description. I read one of your previous comments and you said needs or something. Since when do ENTJs talk about needs. lol .... 

The previous reply is right ... I should have given my reasons."
mbti,fht0blm,t3_f4rog5,1581868195.0,Probably extroverted types who actually think you can actually spread genes without having kids will be up for it. IME introverts probably prefer some sort of serial monogamy.
