Long answer: The military is the final boss. But a lot like Gannon in breath of the wild if we accomplish everything else before going after them it will be a lot easier. Before we go for the military we need to destabilize it. We need to be the anti military. Where the military abuses it's soldiers we will treat soldiers with respect. Where the military ignores veterans we will aid and respect them. When government hospitals refuse to help injured soldiers we will step in and help them. Over time the healthy soldiers will see that we care about them and the military doesn't. After a while this will split the military. Then we use the military to defeat the military. We will avoid conflict whenever possible and as the other sides moral drops we will take their sick in and raise confidence in our own cause"

You need to remember, it only takes three percent of a population to start a revolution. You don't need everyone to agree with you, just one in thirty.

As far as responsibility goes you need to look beyond the authoritarian. Capitalism tells you that people are greedy. Authoritarianism tells you that people are to be feared. Neither are natural laws, and the further you get from those ideologies the more you will see this is true.

Start looking at the people around you and seeing how they help reach other. You will be surprised how many little things we do without threat or reward. The vanguard will tell you that they are the only thing holding the world together, there wrong. Human nature holds the world together."
