AskReddit,fl55xcf,t3_fmcmlr,1584829221.0,"I went over to one of my friends house for dinner around Christmas time. We were all chit chatting and joking around I thought it would be a good idea to tell a funny story about how my cousin still believed in Santa. I told them how he actually had set up video cameras near his chimney to catch him. I ended my story saying something like ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt believe that he still believes in Santa at his age‚Äù. To my horror, I quickly realize that no one was laughing. The entire family had their jaw dropped and had all stopped eating mid bite. I looked over to my friend for some affirmation and she sadly looks down and said ‚Äú I believe in Santa‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I felt so terrible and quickly tried to explain that I meant that I didn‚Äôt believe that Santa could fit down the chimney, but that I believed in him too. I‚Äôm still horrified at myself to this day."

I used to hate my family and was always upset at my best friend and now all I have for them is love. That wasn‚Äôt because I just became nice on my own...I really don‚Äôt think I am capable of that kind of change. If you think you are being a bad person and you want to change that, I would consider looking into Christianity."

 I recently tried to start reading more but I have also had a bit of difficulty finding books I enjoy that also have clean content.

AskReddit,fj4g84l,t3_fbdgi5,1583007538.0,"How to rely on yourself as much as you can, especially regarding money and debt. My parents have handled all of my financial issues for the last four years. I enrolled in a college with a yearly tuition of $40,000. They assured me that they would pay it all off for me and that I wouldn‚Äôt have any debt...my dad owns his own business and promised me that he would be able to help me out. Now he is living paycheck to paycheck and can‚Äôt help me at all. I was so foolish to think that I could rely on someone else in that way. 

Moral of the story: Don‚Äôt make life decisions based on other‚Äôs promises."
Christian,fir7wzc,t3_f7it7t,1582659140.0,I have anxiety too. I recently realized that just because I am suffering in the moment doesn‚Äôt mean that God isn‚Äôt  good or that He is not with me. Life is painful sometimes (a lot of the time) but that does not detract from the goodness of God-He is with you in your best moments and your worst

AnxietyDepression,fh9rw9i,t1_fh9r7bq,1581388201.0,"Honestly it might be good to share that with her! It‚Äôs ok to tell her just that-‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to bombard you or pressure you with texting but I also don‚Äôt want you to think that I have given up because that‚Äôs the last thing I would do, is there something that I can do that would help you the most? ‚Äú something along those lines. I can‚Äôt speak for her but if it were me a text every so often is a good reminder that you are still there. It can also be good to text often,  but preface your  texts saying that there is no need for a quick response/response at all. 

Above all it‚Äôs just patience and kindness that is needed."
AnxietyDepression,fh9q4dp,t3_f2079u,1581387074.0,"You are spot on! I have anxiety/depression and I do exactly what she seems to be doing. I always feel bad for doing it but sometimes I just can‚Äôt help it. What helps me the most is having the reassurance that the person I‚Äôve been neglecting is not mad at me, will still be there for me, and that they don‚Äôt expect me to be better at any given point in time.

Just know that this doesn‚Äôt diminish your value: People do messed up things to others and it has absolutely nothing to do with who you are.

AnxietyDepression,fgsy003,t3_f035ub,1581094991.0,"Sometimes it helps me to do a small task and then break that down even further. For example if you know you need a shower the very first step is sitting up in bed. Then taking off the covers And so on and so on. If the most you can do is sit up in bed, that‚Äôs still progress and it‚Äôs a step in the right direction.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fgslxym,t3_f07n0i,1581087579.0,I pick at my face all the time and I have anxiety also. Recently I tried covering up the bad spots with a bandaid while I‚Äôm at home so I can‚Äôt pick at it. It worked fairly well. You might try wearing a hat /beanie/headband to cover up your eyebrows so that you don‚Äôt have as easy access to them!
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fgoa7cl,t3_ezl94o,1580963694.0,"I would just be direct! It‚Äôs okay to address what happened to try and figure out where you both stand. If you feel comfortable enough to state what you want first it may make him more comfortable sharing where he is at. For example ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm really interested in you and I enjoy hanging out with you. I know it‚Äôs been hard to connect and get our schedules lined up, but I like you and I‚Äôd like to spend more time together if that is something you would be interested in as well‚Äù

With all that being said-it is important to remember that he ghosted you and I think you deserve an explanation as to why. Maybe address that before you confess your interest? 

Edit: I forgot that he ghosted"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fgo8unt,t3_ezjjif,1580962684.0,"This sounds so similar to my own family! I‚Äôm currently living with my grandmother now and if you have the option of moving in with friends or another family member that would be my first suggestion. It helped me a ton but I know that wasn‚Äôt an option for me for a really long time and it might not be for you either.

If that‚Äôs not an option, I would try reading the book ‚ÄúBoundaries‚Äù by Dr. Henry Cloud & Dr. John Townsend. Im only on chapter two but it has already shown me SO many ways to help myself deal with my own toxic family. I really can‚Äôt recommend it enough."
