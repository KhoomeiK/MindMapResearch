BPD,fqtirs4,t1_fqsde9r,1589639822.0,"Yeah, I guess you're right. Thanks. I think I'm just tired of busting my ass to be understanding."
BPD,fqtikan,t1_fqs8gol,1589639705.0,"Probably because only us know how much effort does it take for us not to fuck up relationships. And while we're feeling exhausted inside, at the same time from others' perspective it just looks like normal relationship. And sure we can't blame them for that..."
BPD,fqthwdn,t1_fqsft3h,1589639327.0,"Thank you for helping me to look at the situation from this angle. I'd definitely not be able to not think about people. It's always about people and their attitude for me. 

So if we compare not my effort to endure, but the effort not to think, I'd probably fail as well. Thanks, I feel kinda more relieved. And maybe even kinda guilty..."
BPD,fqs79ef,t1_fqrxr8v,1589600114.0,"Yeah I know, and we kinda did. What bugs me here, that such a situation is a repeated pattern in my life. I can't help but wonder what do I do wrong, that makes people not care about me at all, while I'm putting aside my own disorder and depression for their sake. I control myself severely, actually. I might as well be self-absorbed, I might whine and complain and be needy af, I might snap on people, be toxic, resentful and drown myself in self-pity cause that's how I really feel, but I choose not to, because I don't want my friends to suffer because of my mental problems they are not responsible for. I don't want to be that kind of person who is like ""fuck it, if I suffer, you should suffer too!""

So I'm not trying to praise myself here, I'm quite pathetic human being tbh, but... I just wonder why I care enough to put this effort but people don't. Maybe I don't deserve it?"

NTA. God, what is wrong with her, I can't"
AmItheAsshole,fqhhrw6,t3_gie7jj,1589377261.0,"My friend and I swapped our passwords once. We were just joking about how it would be a real shame if one of us dies and somebody (relatives, cops, whatever) would access the page and read our chat (there was a weird text-based role-playing game everywhere). Somehow we got seriously concerned about this and swapped passwords to make sure if one of us dies the other one deletes our chat. Anyway, we promised each other not to log into the account unless one of us dies.

Some time after, I found something I wanted to share with my friend (I don't remember what it was) and I texted her something like ""dude, that's insane""

She wasn't online and I went about my own business… only to come back and find out that she logged into my account. When I called her out, she said that she got concerned by my message and went to ""check"" if something happened. Unbelievable. What would you do if you receive such message from a friend? I bet nobody would rush to inspect their messages to other people. I never would. What a lame excuse to snoop around my page. I was outraged and of course changed my password right away.

Just wanted to share. It's way more stupid than OP's story, but somehow I found it relatable lol

&#x200B;

Definitely NTA. Why come to look for necklace when OP's out? Breaking into other person's house bringing your own germs is not social distancing lol. What a stupid excuse."
antinatalism,fq62ihq,t1_fpw2owy,1589123140.0,"Thanks for your help. Unfortunately, psychologist is not an option here, she is completely opposed to any kind of therapy (thinks that all therapists are morons squeezing money out of people). I even keep my own therapy in secret cause I don't want to listen to that shit. 

It's actually a very complicated case, way too complicated to be able to explain in a few sentences on reddit. Anyway, I'll try to figure it out somehow. Thank you so much for your support and understanding ♡"
antinatalism,fpva92d,t1_fpsupnt,1588939856.0,"Of course I tried. Many many times. She genuinely thinks that she does nothing wrong and every time I try to talk about my feelings she defends herself aggressively, turns things around and plays the pity. She doesn't even have a clue.

Overall it's really not that bad. It was grandma who had been helicoptering beyond any boundaries, and mom is not the same as her. She has some similar patterns in behavior (I believe all people unconsciously adopt a behavioral model of their parents in some way) but they are not that strong, especially now when I am a grown-ass adult and it's harder to put pressure on me lol

I'll figure it out some time. Just most of the time I struggle with my BPD and arguing is not the thing that makes it better haha. Anyway I'd appreciate if you could tell me more about your situation with mom, maybe I can get some useful advice out if it"
BPD,fpsbt3e,t3_gf8m5i,1588870822.0,"I don't identify with my name at all most of my life. And I definitely have a weird feeling when somebody says my name, I'd even say an unpleasant feeling. 

Ya know that psychological thing that every coach recommends, like, ""People like the sound of their name so use a person's name in a conversation if you want to win their favor""? Funny, it works completely opposite for me. I almost cringe when somebody frequently uses my name in a conversation... I'm okay when it is used as a tool to address me directly if a few people are around or to call me in the hallway, but other occasions... ugh. 

Also I have noticed that I always avoid calling other people by their names too. I either give them nicknames or just avoid it at all. Haha I dunno why"
antinatalism,fps4zsa,t1_fpql9vl,1588867559.0,"I'm so sorry. Being threatened like that is just… insane. I hope you don't have to contact them now. 

Yes, it's helicopter parenting, for sure. Luckily I have not lived with grandma for 10 years now. To be honest, all I ever wanted was them to leave me the hell alone. The whole family is fucked up, my grandma raised two generations of mental freaks. 

However I still live with my mom. Most of the time it's okay, she really cares about me. I suppose I have come to terms with the fact that my mother will never leave me alone. And I'm too tired and too depressed to do something about that. Let it be, I guess, though she is a handful, at least she is better than others (grandma and aunt)."
antinatalism,fppxeg0,t3_geqthn,1588811012.0,"My parents were jerks who genuinely believed that withdrawal actually works, so here I am. No shit, they couldn't build a normal family, they were just stupid kids. They got separated when I was only two years old. And of course my mom, a dependent and weak young girl, had been easily deluded by my abusive grandmother and allowed her to take over my upbringing. The hell of a grandma. She completely destroyed my mom's mental health by her mad parenting skills, and she did the same to me. 

So I basically had no chance to grow up into a normal stable person. I grew up in an unhealthy environment where everyone hates each other, while claiming that they love each other. And I was loved with an abusive suffocative ""love"", being constantly reminded that everything they do they do only for me. Even if in fact I was emotionally abused, neglected and suppressed. 

So what do we have as a result? Another broken human being, unable to ever love someone. A weirdo torn apart from reality and constantly depressed. I have a lot of issues including BPD, making my life an existential nightmare. 

I don't hate my mom though. We both suffered from the same abusive parent and I understand her quite well. I just think she was a careless ignorant fool having a baby at 20 years old with a jerk she dated only a year before. She could at least think about an abortion and I wish she did."
BPD,fpkyvkp,t3_gdyl5w,1588703424.0,"Same here, I don't know why is this happening. Maybe it's some kind of perverse sense of justice? Like, maybe I'm just bitter over the lack of response at similar moments in my life, therefore deep inside I don't understand why should I provide support to other people while they don't give a damn about my own feelings. That might be the point."

BPD,fm3yojt,t1_fm3t9bm,1585741603.0,"Wow, same here. A thousand times I've imagined that I save a child or a girl or a little kitten and maybe even die as a hero. I'm actually a coward though."
BPD,flwxfqv,t3_framg2,1585568848.0,"Yeah. I often think I will be better off on my own, and everyone will be better if I just vanish completely. But I constantly fail to do this out of cowardice and silly sentiments."

BPD,fgslabe,t1_fgi78xo,1581087143.0,"By the way! I got seriously concerned about this and I went to see a gyn to make sure there is no hormonal disbalance or whatever. It seems to be ok, but she suggested I take anxiolytics for 10 days before my period (tofisopam to be precise). She gave me a prescription and told me to consult my therapist. The therapist said ok and now I'm taking them. It actually helps. So I suggest you go to see your gyn, maybe they will give you some advice."

BPD,fgs6ink,t3_f05k0e,1581073967.0,"Yes! The same! 

Funny thing: when a good song is stuck in my head, I often start humming it or singing it aloud, and people always ask me questions like 'Why are you so happy? Something good happened?""  and I'm like ""What? No! What made you assume it?"" 

And then they say that a person does not sing aloud if they are not genuinely happy. Well, it's not true, it has nothing to do with my miserable life. I just love the song."
depression,fgizb8y,t3_eykiat,1580834001.0,Wow. Are you inside my head? Cause that's my thoughts.
BPD,fgiu4tl,t3_eypy19,1580830962.0,"I'm always insecure about telling people that I'm depressed or have issues, because it would seem that I have no reason for this and the only reaction I could get was a basic invalidation. Because I have no trauma and I have never been abused. But my therapist said that emotional abuse is an abuse too. Analyzing that now I can say that many years of emotional abuse from my family, my ex-best friend and classmates are the thing that created my BPD. No trauma needed lol"

I don't know how to stop the fear of getting old, of losing my friends because they are making their own families one by one and eventually all of them will leave me. I'm terrified that my mom will pass away one day, that I myself will die and will be forgotten forever. Sometimes I think that it would be better if I die now, and wouldn't have to face all this.

You're not alone. I'm sorry I can't give you some advice because I have no idea how to deal with it, but wish I could hug you now."

I was cooking at my friend's, and asked them to put on one of my favourite songs, and while I was listening to it I felt pure exaltation. I laughed recklessly in joy, and was happier than ever. I really miss that part. I have not experienced something even close to that for a long time and I want to feel it again. But all I get now is this stoned dumb condition. That's just sad."

And maybe to show that he is so over this Griffindor-Slytherin feud. But yeah, it definitely pissed off the shippers :)"
mylittleredacted,ezaqfhi,t3_d0ii3y,1567805837.0,"I kinda feel the same way. Still can't figure out what exactly I feel though. The song was so sweet and touching I even cried but all this just doesn't feel right. Never liked all these timeskips and epilogues where everybody grow up, pair up, have kids, future generations and stuff - it always seems kinda forced for me. E.g. I was particularly frustrated by Harry Potter epilogue, though I can clearly see why it was put there, still it bothered me a lot.

As for the bright sides... I'm totally devoted to Fluttercord so I was very happy to see a hint at them being together, but that's it. 

P.S: When did Rarity occasionally crush on some guy? Did I miss something?"
