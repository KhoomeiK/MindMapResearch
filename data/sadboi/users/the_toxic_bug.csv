Genetic: some bug in the some mechanism of metabolism of dopamine (the feel good and accomplished molecule)

Adquired: Use abusive of dopaminergics, drugs, games, sex and that temporarily desensitize the dopamine receptors, so the same dopamine stops having the same effect 

I can only talk about the genetic type since it's the one I have, my brain have less dopamine so I need more to feel contempt, it's false when u say I can't focus on anything, actualy I focus in a lot more things than you, but for less time than you.

Since I have low dopamine I've turned into a dopamine junkie, so my brain will look for all the things arround me very quickly to know which one will give more dopamine, so my brain never stop it's like an squirl on cafeine junkie.

And with low dopamine comes another cool thing addictions, I have much more probability of getting an addiction, actualy I get addict to everything that gives me dopamine, food, sex drugs, I obcess when a thing gives me dopamine

But I am lucky and I have obcessed with knowledge, learning gives me dopamine and I will learn new things as an obcession, so yeah I'm smart
