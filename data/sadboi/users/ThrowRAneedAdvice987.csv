dating_advice,fd6jhnn,t1_fd6f2y5,1578191987.0,"him being divorced with kids, is not lost on me. I am divorced with a kid so that doesn't scare me. I agree that we are very different people, with different things we like to do. I like going to dinner and having drinks and he likes camping and going to good will. maybe i've turned into a snob. I'm pretty sure I'm a snob now even though I grew up dirt poor. I think I will get hurt here, because no matter how much money a dude has- they are fuckers- but I think in real life, money doesn't really matter. I'm kind of annoyed with myself that I even posted this. cause he's a fun guy and I kinda don't care how destroyed I get from this. I wanna date him. I wanna know him. I wanna have fun with him like we do. I wanna stop being a snob."

dating_advice,fd6dyc3,t1_fd6aho1,1578189514.0,"of course I have my reservations, I am not a naive woman- he is working on getting his shit together and is months away? it seems from getting everything back in order... so he says. I don't make money banking on people and certainly have made character mistakes in the past. but he does have potential to get his shit back together. I just call it quits before I give him a chance? I am really asking. not like, just asking for a dick reason. like I said, I am not a rich person. I'm just.. luckier than him?"
dating_advice,fd6ctef,t1_fd6cak5,1578189011.0,"ok, this seems to be the general idea i guess. but men date women of lower finances all the time? why does it have to be different? like I said- I am not rich. But.. I take my career really seriously and also have had some good luck befall me money wise.. Don't men have to deal with this often?"
dating_advice,fd69j9w,t1_fd68axs,1578187593.0,why tho? what are flags that u see that I guess I am blind too? to run away fast?
relationship_advice,f8nenf8,t1_f8kl5h9,1574642591.0,"Yes that is true. I don't know why I said he does feel safe with me, because you are 100 percent correct. He is protecting himself from me which makes me feel deeply sad but it makes sense. I would never date anyone while this is going on however I wish it would just go away so I could stop being such an intense weirdo all the time."
relationship_advice,f8kdjga,t1_f8kbp90,1574610063.0,"I can't seduce him. He won't even let me hug him, let alone get close enough to get on that. He acts as if I am made of fire and if I touch him he will die. He has never been like this before with me but he has made it very clear that I am not allowed in his bubble which I do respect."
relationship_advice,f8kba20,t1_f8k8utv,1574609441.0,I think he does feel safe with me now tho. We spend a lot of time together (as friends). Do u mind if I ask what is a love language? and what does that mean?
relationship_advice,f8k9y3f,t1_f8k76nw,1574608982.0,"thank you, this was really good advice. I feel very selfish because I know I need to tell  him but I don't want to lose him from my life. It feels wrong in my guts to not have him in my world but I understand why that might be where the pieces fall. I just have to work up the courage to tell him. Also tho- I am worried a little bit that maybe everyone else is right in our lives and he has still been in love with me all this time which makes me feel so sad because it would just be like, he was waiting all this time for me to be single and that is about 10 years. I don't think that is the case though I guess I'm not sure. Even if he was in love with me still, he knows we cannot be together, his family would never approve and I don't blame them."
