Accepting it won't come instantly while staring at a body part you hate in the mirror naked all of the time. First, try treating yourself to a nice bra or top that makes you feel awesome and work your way down from there. You can look sexy without a plunging neckline and perfect cleavage. Tbh I feel sexy in turtlenecks.  I'm in the same boat as you and I think we don't give ourselves enough credit. Also remember it's okay to feel bad about it in the 'love yourself' culture. Your feelings are completely valid!!"
