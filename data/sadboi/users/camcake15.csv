SkincareAddiction,fmfcrm5,t3_fuvadm,1586024537.0,Do you rest your chin on your hands or touch that part of your face a lot? I had bad breakouts on my chin and realized it was because I was always resting my face on my hands while working.
mentalhealth,fe3vgn7,t3_enph29,1578853207.0,My father thinks he is in the middle of an FBI investigation and that our entire neighborhood/ town is against him. He genuinely believes that he is being watched and has completely isolated him and my mother. It’s hard to watch and I haven’t figured out what to do either except encourage seeing a mental health professional. Who knows if they ever will but at some point it becomes out of your control. I would just be supportive about seeking help and hopefully he realizes that this is consuming his life.
personalfinance,fdmhpyn,t3_em4w0b,1578550306.0,"Try to get on food stamps and apply to on campus positions that don’t require a lot of labor ( ex. working at the library) so you can study when there is down time, that job will give you enough for weekly gas and pocket change. This is how I survived college, it’s rough but doable if you manage your time well."

SkincareAddiction,ey9merw,t1_ey9m9gr,1566946886.0,deep breaths dog I promise it'll get better!
SkincareAddiction,ey9m7by,t1_ey9lby9,1566946738.0,"Ugh I know I'm sorry. I went through the same process as you where I couldn't find my trigger, cut everything out of my diet, and nothing helped. I finally put two and two together that during the most stressful times of my life I also had my worst PD flairs. I have bad anxiety too but I just tell myself the more I stress the worse my skin will get lol sometimes it works, sometimes its unavoidable"
SkincareAddiction,ey9lsot,t3_cw9pb6,1566946447.0,"My derm turned me on to epionce milky cleanser and it doesn't irritate my skin. I also use the epionce medical barrier cream on my non affected areas and then let my PD dry out completely when I get flairs. My PD hates anything I put on it (on god I've tried every PD ""cure"" imaginable- nothing has worked) so I just leave it alone and I don't take medication because I found that it made it worse.

For make up, I use colourpop no filter concealer for when I have to be in public. I haven't had any issues with it on my PD (aka it doesn't make it worse lol) and it's only $6.

 I have chronic sensitive skin and during my flairs when I could barely touch my face I used the epionce products so they might be a good match. I highly recommend."
SkincareAddiction,ey9l8t7,t3_cw9yvk,1566946053.0,"Severe PD sufferer here- I found that my number one trigger is anxiety. I find that when I'm going through a really stressful time that my PD flairs bad. As stupid as it sounds, learning to control my anxiety has greatly reduced my PD. Another major trigger was the maybelline rewind concealer so I just steer clear from that.

Anyways, my derm turned me on to epionce milky cleanser and it doesn't irritate my skin. I also use the epionce medical barrier cream on my non affected areas and then let my PD dry out completely when I get flairs. My PD hates anything I put on it (on god I've tried every PD ""cure"" imaginable- nothing has worked) so I just leave it alone and I don't take medication because I found that it made it worse.

Stay strong, PD freaking sucks but eventually you will find what works for you! I have chronic sensitive skin and during my flairs when I could barely touch my face I used the epionce products so they might be a good match. I highly recommend."

GRE,evgcdwj,t1_evgbq8m,1564508646.0,I basically finished them in my previous studying. Should I go through them again?
ClinicalGenetics,evam17s,t1_ev9yism,1564351181.0,Thank you! I am planning on retaking the GRE in October to hopefully bump those scores up. I appreciate the reassuring words! It definitely boosted my confidence about applying this round!
GRE,eutcii6,t1_eutaual,1564023623.0,Like Magoosh?
GRE,eutakpv,t1_eut11hi,1564022773.0,How should I start making a study plan? I feel like that was the hardest part for me before I took it initially. My studying was just sorta random not really structured.
ClinicalGenetics,eumr05h,t1_eukyf7m,1563919358.0,It is an option. I was thinking I would take it early October if I was going to retake it. I just wanted to avoid that at all costs. But unfortunately I don't think I am going to be able too.
ClinicalGenetics,eulontn,t1_eukz1u4,1563904864.0,"Just realized I made a mistake in the post, I got a 149v and 149q. Regardless still pretty rough scores. I’m going to consider retaking it."
ClinicalGenetics,euhuv3c,t1_euhs4e8,1563834627.0,Yeah I've heard that also! Mine are so bad though they might matter lol I might retake it. I really just don't want to go through the motions of study of it again but it might have to happen..
ClinicalGenetics,euhqkla,t1_euhoa4w,1563832256.0,"Thats really good to hear! I think I might just give it a go with my current GRE score and GPA. I am having two of my professors write me recommendation letters, one of them being my advisor who I worked with in the genetics lab with. Another who was my professor for my upper division molecular cell biology & biochemistry and molecular cell biology courses. I got A's in both so I'm hoping that helps."
GRE,euenixp,t1_eue1ek7,1563748888.0,Very true. I just am so bad at standardized testing and I knew I was going to choke no matter what. I think for my program I should be ok but I really just don’t want to retake it lol
GRE,eudwcei,t1_eudw3fy,1563729176.0,Oh ya I think you will be totally fine! I scored disturbingly low and I probably should retake it. I have a pretty strong application overall though so I might try to get away with not taking it again lol
GRE,eudvjvy,t1_euch07y,1563728606.0,I’m in the same boat! I did pretty freaking bad honestly and scored under my programs recommendations also which was disappointing.. but I do feel good about the writing section so I’m hoping that helps too. Are you planning on retaking it?
GRE,eu9zyxq,t1_eu9zmf7,1563596108.0,I’m feeling pretty damn nervous lol But sorta in the same boat. Trying to stay positive and to not be hard on myself if I don’t do well.
GRE,eu9z8lx,t1_etuf6h1,1563595407.0,How’re you feeling for tomorrow??
TwoXChromosomes,eu6ai09,t3_cez8ym,1563495832.0,"First of all, it's not your fault this happened to you. I am sorry that your parents are terrible human beings and are making your circumstances even worse. Definitely see a professional. I work in abortion care and have seen the results of women who go rouge with abortion when times are tough. The results can be pretty detrimental. I know that South Dakota is far but if you can make it to Idaho there is a foundation called NorthWest Abortion Access fund. They can give you financial help. Stay strong! I know that it feels like your world is crumbling right now, but you will figure out a way for it to be resolved! You have an entire community right here supporting you, so don't feel alone in your endeavors."
GRE,etuez83,t1_etudllg,1563211071.0,Yeah its been my saving grace during this whole experience! Good luck though and hang in there. We will be free before we know it!
GRE,etua4cn,t1_etu62dg,1563207900.0,Yeah I've been having really bad stress dreams. I also have a major interview this week which isn't helping. I don't know if this is up your alley but CBD has been helping me sleep recently. It knocks me out and I sleep like a baby.
GRE,etu5n98,t1_etu51gm,1563204849.0,"Same. I just can't wait to never have to look at another quant math problem again. I also hope I do well enough to not retake it. I think we will be fine, we just can't let the stress consume us on test day."
GRE,etu3w1w,t1_ettzcgm,1563203607.0,"Wow I relate to this so hard. My first two practice tests I took at the public library some guy literally started stalking me and just happened to sit across from me every time I went to the library. I had to stop going because it was affecting my scores and just aiding to my anxieties. On my last free PP2 I got a 154V 147Q, I decided not to buy the additional test because I figured it would just stress me out too much right before the exam (I'm also broke and didn't want to cough up more money for the test lol). I have just accepted my fate at this point. I am just going to try to improve as much as I can this week. Totally sympathize with you and honestly I'm just so excited this part of my life is going to be over! We will kill it!"
