BPD,fjmn882,t1_fjm3mlc,1583475897.0,"I can give a few examples, but yes I shared it with him before we ended up being together as like a 'warning?' I guess. He's been pretty supportive. I've also known about my BPD for a few years now. Always got misdiagnosed as Bipolar in the past, now I'm trying to get into DBT or counseling again after a referral to seek treatment.

I seem to get overly defensive when he would criticize me, or even upset me by having an opposing opinion (whatever it may be) so I get angry and end up I guess rationing my feelings towards him and deciding to cut off all emotions to him and be ""cold"" to him to prove a point. It probably sounds really childish. Even if I feel like he's having more fun with other people sometimes playing games I would somewhat take offense and think that I'm just not as fun to play those games with (I play them with him occasionally.)

Any ways of I guess 'caring' as in telling me to go to the gym or to eat better, or 'take care of myself' would cause me to become angry and accuse him of thinking I'm not good enough and that he thinks I'm fat, and that he should just find someone who's 'better' than me.

It's kind of difficult to explain, but there are so many situations that would cause me to believe he's doubting me or questioning me, and I would end up taking it personally and just ""shutting off"" that type of communication with him or any opinions I had.. I've had periods where I go numb on him and barely give him affection after I seem to split, but then returning to normal and stuff. Sometimes it can take like a week for me to return to giving him affection or being open to him. As of late I've been pretty stable. I know there's more example but it's late over here so I'm almost in bed for the night. I hope that answers your question!"

Unfortunately in situations like this, we know the behavior is wrong and we expect partners to give us the same liberties and such. Such as our own friends, male or female, and freedom of our own, because that's what healthy relationships are supposed to be like. We are at times very logical and we know what the right course of action is. I'm not sure if you can even call it trust issues. You feel like if they're laughing with her, they find her funnier or they are happier with them. Or if they'd rather spend some time with their female friends, they prefer them to you. You know it's completely normal to have friendships, but our brains overthink *every aspect* of their friendships and their behavior around them. I also believe it's a reflection of our own mindset. I sometimes would go for any person who would even give me the time of day, so I fear my partner doing the same thing. It's hard to understand stable relationships and unconditional love with this disorder at times. I'm sorry if this wasn't accurate or helpful, but you are not alone in these feelings I promise you."

It's honestly kind of difficult to not perceive it as a ""slap in the face"" to those who struggle with this everyday, and it's not exactly the person's fault either. Most of the time they do not mean it maliciously, almost always do not mean it that way.

Worked for a pizza place for a day after orientation and once after and I was thrown on the registers with no training whatsoever and barely anybody to back me up. I was hired as a part time, but was given 50 hours my first week. The manager was an absolute witch because I had got an order from the same company on my way home that night from another nearby, and it wasn't right. Called to tell them it wasn't and apparently corporate didn't like that I had anything to say so I got grilled the next day by the manager and she told me to not be so ridiculous and dramatic about a wrong order, I almost slapped her I swear. She just had that face. Fast forward a few hours, I had a customer come in and take an order, he told me that the place cycles through people constantly and that there is always new employees here. He said that the management wasn't good, and that's a red flag coming from a customer. I walked out from my shift that day and never came back, never called or anything. I ended up working from home and doing some streaming to get by while I found something else.

However, the aftermath was horrible. My mom would have been furious if she found out if I left because of being yelled at (she thinks I need to toughen up).

I honestly don't have much experience with savage, so I started out with Chaos and Midgardsormr since I was a new player around the time sigmascape was still the highest. I found Middy the funnest and was definitely a proud moment for me when I cleared it. Haven't experienced o11s fully or o12s unfortunately.

Midgardsormr was really challenging and it showed that I was definitely capable of doing high end content even though I was terrified, I learned how to tank with these raids."
