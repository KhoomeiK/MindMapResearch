india,fq5ljsc,t1_fq5b1lq,1589109964.0,"1. Loose aim maybe? I really can't say why he didn't kill. She was a demoness and a threat. I think it has to do with her being a woman. 

2. I meant Ram was desperate for an army, because which husband won't be upset if his wife is kidnapped away? 
The calling out part is true though. But Bali was no saint. Sugreev heard screams which he thought were of Bali, and closed the entrance of cave so that the demon who ""killed"" Bali doesn't come out. I don't know why Angad wasn't made king. Or maybe it was fellow Vanaras who had a choice, and chose Sugreev? AFAIK Angad was made Yuvaraj after Bali's death.

3. Ram was on exile. Asking for help would mean crossing limits of that exile and breaking promise to his late father. And Raghuvanshis took promises too seriously. 
Like I said he was desperate for an army. 
There are shlokas which suggest that Ram did have a fair fight, Bali was said to have been throwing trees and boulders at him, and that was when Ram killed him with a single arrow. If Bali did not see Ram why will he start attacking him?  In various conversations it is mentioned that Ram killed Vali in a combat. According to Valmiki Ramayan. 

He was the same guy who freed Ahilya from a curse she got because of infidelity. Then why would he send his wife away whom he fought to get back for so many years? Just because some people talk on their back? Wouldn't sending her away prove them right? Wasn't that contradictory to his nature?
But I also don't think people back then had the backbone to gossip about the rulers they considered Gods. They were not woke like us. 

People celebrate him because of good wins over evil thing(though I'm a firm believer of everyone having grey shades) Ravan was very powerful and he instilled fear in all three worlds. He also had boon that only a human could kill him(but it couldn't be done by any ordinary human, hence Ramavtar). He was really knowledgeable and powerful and shit. So ya he was the ultimate bad guy who was finally defeated, so people rejoice his end."
india,fq59g7k,t1_fq581b6,1589097013.0,"Seriously?They drag one sequence for 2-3 episodes. I used to watch it myself but got fed up because of all this shit. There are many versions but Vyasa's one is original. 

The problem is it feels like a saas bahu drama, which i always hate. They are better looking cast but they don't look like people from Dwapar Yug. Pretty sure people back then didn't have men with six packs and zero figure women, and it looks very fake. Sorry but I can't help not liking it. 
Even dialogue delivery is average, except for some who were really good. Cringeworthy scenes too. 
Example: Shakuni was killed in a fair battle. But his death in SPM was such a disgrace. Like dude they're warriors in a battlefield, not kids playing passing the parcel. Spare them some dignity lmao.

But anyway unpopular opinions are alright. I just gave some reasons why I don't like SPM."
india,fq58b0e,t1_fmema13,1589095872.0,"Flirting? That woman(Surpanakha) was going to kill Sita because both men rejected her, and her weapon was ready. It was either kill or get killed. 

That king(Bali)you're talking about threw his brother out for a small misunderstanding and kept the same brother's wife as a concubine. Desperate situations require desperate measures. 

The kicking out thing is not true, the whole uttar kand is full of lies and distortions added much later which can be easily refuted because it contradicts the older chapters of original Ramayan. 

The returning back to earth thing never happened. Ramayan actually had an happy ending. Yes, Lav-Kush were their children, but they never lived in forest. Ram ruled Ayodhya with Sita by his side for 10,000 of years. (The live spans were really long in Treta Yuga). TV serial makers also didn't bother to research about further.

I used to hate Ram because of the last part, until I came across legit arguments against authenticity of Uttar Kand.
People take TV serials as 100% truth and dont try to learn their ancient history, that's why so many misconceptions exist."
