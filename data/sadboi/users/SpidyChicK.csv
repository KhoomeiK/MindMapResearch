Your gf needs to understand her disease and learn how to control it. It's hard, but def not something they are going to be able to do in an emergency room. Try looking up different excercises and methods to control anxiety attacks and instead of taking her to the hospital sit with here and try them out. 

The worse thing you can do is single her out and make her feel alone. It takes time but she will figure it out and learn her disease, but you both are young so give it time. Good luck."
