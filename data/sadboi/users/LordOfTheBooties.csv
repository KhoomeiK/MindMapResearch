StopSelfHarm,fdlacgv,t3_elyalr,1578519804.0,"Let me start out by saying you have not failed as a father. You've been there for your daughter when she's needed you most. 

I used to self harm pretty regularly, usually razor blade cuts to the legs. My parents got divorced when I was 13, and my dad was never a fantastic father. I had no reason to tell him. However my mom was, and still is, one of my best friends. To this day, she still doesn't know I've ever self harmed. The fact that your daughter has told you each time she's hurt herself, is incredible. She understands that it isn't a healthy way of coping, she's telling you because she knows you can help her.

Unfortunately, I don't have advice for you. I managed to pull myself out of that state without help. Just don't be so hard on yourself, you seem to be a better dad than most. Continue to be there for your daughter. Show her that life is worth living, take her places, have fun with her. She will be so grateful (I'm sure she already is) to have a father like you once she looks back on this time of her life."
