They fed us family meals made with meats and produce that were, or were about to be, gone off. There is nothing safe or secure about working in a restaurant, management doesn't care about you, and when money and you are on a scale, you are disposable. 
I quit last year, it was really hard for me, because I was also obsessed with making money and the lifestyle, but I saw myself fading, and tried a different career. Still unemployed from covid, but the stress from hoping they don't call me back isn't there... but if they did? I would move in with my parents and never go back, because if you think for one minute that a manager is going to provide a sanitary work environment and care about your personal welfare, you haven't worked for a new Orleans restaurant long enough.
