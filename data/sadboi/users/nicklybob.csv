I have no idea what your prospects are getting back to the way you used to be, but I can speak for what makes long-term anhedonia a bit more bearable. Working a full time busy job (retail) feels better than being unemployed, gives me a reason to get up five days a week. Same applies to going to school and doing weekly volunteering. I would say keeping busy helps but it's hard for me as a depressed person to motivate myself to be busy, so I have to set up these external reasons to force me to be busy like having a job or registering to be a volunteer. Having pets / being with animals distracts me and keeps me busy for a few hours a week so that helps too. I've tried many antidepressants (currently on mirtazipine) and one that works can magically help existing just feel a bit better."

Everything is because I'm not good enough, therefore opportunities are not available to me and I'll settle for mediocrity or settle for not chasing what I want. I get sad for no reason and it gets really heavy and physically painful and mentally blinding and stays and I just have to wait for it to pass because no distraction or self-harm or drinking or any other release will make it go away and I can't kill myself because either at the moment I don't want to or my parents don't want me to so no escape from that. I'm scared of everything because I'm too weak to handle it. I'm scared of relationships because I'm scared of commitment, scared of not being good enough, scared of being a burden to them, because of my complete lack of confidence.

I've been in and out of therapy. It might help but it doesn't really help enough and therapists sometimes don't know what to do about my unrelenting pessimism, which makes me fear feeling better because I don't deserve it / don't want to feel good and then feel bad again, and think I'm not good enough to handle getting better and being normal. Meds do most of the help, I'm on venlafaxine for anxiety which I found quickly and mirtazipine for depression which took 7 years to find.

It's takes energy to find a therapist alone, and I guess if you really wanted to get them treatment you could give them contact information for therapists or specific numbers to hotlines instead of just like sending links to those self-help websites or something vague... I'd say be there to listen all the time, but if they're really that bad for years and years it's gonna take a toll on you and they know that and you'll feel that. Like, I want my friends to tell me to stop talking about my problems at this point if it gets too much, but do it gently and don't just tell them to stop and end it there, tell them they can come back another time and they're not turned away... sorry for the rant..."
depression,fcfj1ju,t1_fccjoau,1577630520.0,Me too. I hate the aftermath! I hate having to deal with hospitals and therapists and sad parents. That's the part that makes me dislike thinking about past attempts
depression,fc62d60,t3_egdm43,1577470701.0,Me too. The world is going on around me and people are doing things and I'm doing nothing waiting to die.
SuicideWatch,fc1rj9m,t3_efn0iu,1577327450.0,"I've been depressed and anxious since 13 and I'm 23 and only gotten worse, I hope (for my parents sake because I always wish I was dead) to be improved as much as this when I'm 29"
SuicideWatch,fc1rals,t3_efmx50,1577327224.0,"I tried for the past few years to make my life about animals, getting small pets because that's the only thing I'm allowed in my parents' rented apartment and trying to get jobs in the animal field. This year I got fired for no reason besides not having grown up with dogs compared to my coworkers, had a horrible time in a vet office and completely gave up going into the animal field, and killed a couple pets because I'm so depressed and neglectful of myself of course I'd end up killing pets eventually. On top of existing severe depression and anxiety. So I feel like a failure and have no reason to live too besides my parents don't want me to die"
OCD,fbic0ig,t3_edc3bg,1576896646.0,"OCD plus depression together, when both are severe, is nearly deadly for me. It’s horrible."
depression,fbahnsc,t1_fb9wn85,1576678428.0,"They always want to find out why I’m like this because then they know where to target their treatment I guess, like if I had trauma help me get over the trauma or if I had family history help me cope with living with mentally ill family and figure out meds or treatment based on genetics (what genes might be at fault, what worked for family). Since there’s no reason I’m like this and it’s been so long, I found I’m more likely to hear there’s just something up with my brain and we have to start a treatment plan from scratch by trial and error."
StopSelfHarm,fb5j4iy,t3_eaxaoa,1576528593.0,I feel you on the wishing it were that easy part. It’s hard to kill yourself. Physically. Not to mention mentally.
StopSelfHarm,fb2jtjf,t1_fb2jami,1576452359.0,"Thanks, I'll try that"
StopSelfHarm,fb2ik8w,t1_fb2ia8r,1576451698.0,"Yup. My depression has stumped all therapists. My last therapist stopped seeing me, maybe because she wasn't helping with depression?? I don't even know"

StopSelfHarm,fb2hxzl,t3_e8mf7a,1576451375.0,"I feel you on ""get help"" and nothing actually helps. I've talked to general and mental health care professionals, been to the hospital, get my meds changed all the time, called crisis lines, talked to friends, family and strangers, drank too much, taken sleeping pills, etc to feel relief when I feel so bad and nothing can make me feel better."
StopSelfHarm,fb2gucn,t1_fb2gbx4,1576450796.0,"I've been trying really hard to not do it again even though I really want to. I'm managing not to by thinking about how it literally did nothing except make me look like I got in a car crash and I have to deal with the aftermath. 

I was trying to hit my head through a window before this but building management recently put bars in front of the windows to stop theft and I thought it was useless of them but it did stop me from breaking the window so it did something good."
StopSelfHarm,fb2gctm,t1_fb2fudk,1576450542.0,"I don't know. I just didn't. There was loud ringing in my head for a few seconds after and there was a lot of bleeding and now there's a giant lump on my head. Don't worry about making me feel bad, I'm kinda just posting to talk about it like any other conversation and I feel like shit and like ranting right now."
OCD,faomn4l,t3_ea8vnu,1576267749.0,Congrats! :)
Anxiety,faolgh0,t3_ea7h08,1576266991.0,I'd be really mad if my doctor told me that.
OCD,faokt9r,t3_ea6xop,1576266584.0,Yes. It's easiest and I have social anxiety and *very* little energy
depression,fabhyfj,t3_e8cmw4,1575923507.0,In my experience normal people are so disturbed by the thought of anyone even harming themselves let alone killing themselves that they deny the existence of idea. It's their problem borne of their lack of experience/perspective that they can't fathom how anyone would want to hurt or kill themselves.
jerma985,fabgz1z,t3_e8c84j,1575923084.0,lol wtf
depression,f9yo7gr,t1_f9ovwyy,1575731416.0,"Yeah they said ""damaged"". It was not only about brain changes but also the trajectories I've taken in my life. I agree though, I feel like it'd be a lie to say I could be completely cured and get the life I'd have if I didn't get depressed. I guess it primes them to teach me how to manage my mental problems instead of try to cure me too."
depression,f9nz2b6,t1_f9n0vjn,1575493219.0,Even doctors and therapists tell me my life will always be damaged by depression at this point (depressed for 10 years and have only gotten worse). I accepted it a long time ago that there’s no point wondering how I would have turned out without depression and anxiety. I’d have to teach myself how to live and socialize again just like I re-taught myself everything after getting depression and anxiety.
depression,f9im1bm,t3_e4x6ch,1575340411.0,"Yes. I'm not capable of enjoying living for myself, I refuse to get in a relationship or have kids because I'm not doing that to someone else, and I've been in constant sadness and declining mental state for the past decade with no signs of improvement, so I'd rather kill myself. Unfortunately I don't have the heart to do that to my parents so I'm waiting until they die first."
depression,f8pq2ia,t3_e1jfhd,1574705495.0,"I get like that with drinking, except I'm starting to get bad effects from drinking even a little so that helps stop it on work nights. Boredom is such a hard part of depression. Nothing engages me so I just sit there waiting to die basically, and inviting maladaptive or dangerous behaviours for a little excitement. Sorry I have no answers, I just relate to your post."
depression,f8pk0ko,t3_e1iden,1574702762.0,"I'm sorry you feel this way, mental illness is so isolating :( I started a blog and twitter for the sole purpose of talking about how sad I am because I wanted to stop bothering my friends and it helps me, even if no one reads them"
depression,f8p7fvm,t3_e1gyj1,1574696912.0,"Maybe you can ask your doctor for something to help you sleep? I'm on Effexor which makes me sweat so much my coworkers would ask if I was okay, so the doctor prescribed Oxybutynin which stops the sweating and makes my body temperature feel better in general. Sorry for not having an answer to your question."
