TrueOffMyChest,f9mwzla,t3_e5zgol,1575472115.0,"That's an immature thing to say in my opinion. I don't know how old you are but at a certain point in life you will realize that looks and love have very litle to do with each other. If I am being honest I believe that there isn't really true love in a lot of relationships between very beautiful people and they often date each other for the body not for the soul.   


I have seen many couples in which one person is by far less physically attractive than the other one. It doesn't matter.  They love each other. love goes beyond looks. It's about compatability and finding someone that you have a great time with and you know they will always be there no matter what.   


I know i. e. that I am considered very attractive in societies standards but I would never want a partner that likes me for my looks. What if my face gets burned in a grease fire or I gain a lot of weight after pregnancy or I end up disabled from an accident. I want a partner that will always love me for me and I will always love them for them.  Real mature people know that.

&#x200B;

Of course theres a difference between ""not exactly physically attractive"" and just ""doesn't take care of themselves"" one thing you can't do anything about and it doesn't matter and one thing is your choice and makes you unattractive to people. But that is a different story."
Horses,f9mwa9c,t3_e5si4v,1575471678.0,"You're doing really well. Just a few suggestions: While going over the jump you should already know where you want to go after it and then put more of your weight into the stirrup of the side you are trying to go. That way your horse can land in the correct lead.   
Overall using your weight pushing down into one stirrup more than the other and looking where you're going is a great way to get your horse to go in the right directions rather than using the reins when you're standing in the stirrups.

What I have noticed though is that there are certain people that just get offended or annoyed by literally anything. The people that are nice and worth talking to wouldn‚Äôt do that unless you really crossed a line. 
So my suggestion would be to just directly communicate to them that you have a hard time with that and you do not mean to cause any offense at all. And that if you do cause them offense to please know it is not your intention and to please tell you so that you can learn to avoid that in the future.
