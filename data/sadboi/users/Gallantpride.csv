Scoobydoo,fqtoj6x,t3_gk14w3,1589643007.0,"Quick thoughts:

- The intro confused me. They played a Tupac song and featured a boom box so I figured it was a 1990s flashback. Cut to Shaggy using an iPod. So early 2000s flashback? But then it turns on to be a smartphone... So it's modern day? It's so weird seeing them use 2010s technology. The characters are Gen Z? I thought the movie would be in an ambiguous time period or a retro-inspired time period (like Mystery Incorporated).
- I don't like Daphne with green eyes. She looks better with blue. Too many fictional redheads have green eyes
- Fred's redesign looks weird.
- Shaggy's voice is odd. It's like in a sound equivalent of the Uncanny Valley-- it sounds like Shaggy, yet also sounds like a mediocre impersonation of Shaggy
- I liked everyone but Velma. Her design is a ""cutened up"" design like in Mystery Incorporated and she has a similar attitude, both of which I think messes with her appeal. She seems too much like a snarky hipster, not like Velma. Her voice was also the one who least resembled her main voices.
- Scooby being a talking dog but also being a pet has a bunch of weird implications.
- I liked the crossover part. I didn't know the film was a crossover. It's always fun seeing HB characters cross over. I swear, Dynomutt and >!Captain Caveman!< do better in crossovers then they do in solo cartoons.
- Is this the first time characters have cursed in the franchise's history? Velma said ""hell"", whicu is a very mild curse (and could be a reason for getting a PG rating). Maybe they've cursed in Scooby Apocalypse or the live-action films.

Overall, it's better then I thought it'd be. It's a perfectly enjoyable film on par with the original Scooby Doo theatrical film."
