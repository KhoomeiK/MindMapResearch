It may sound funny, but full metal jacket got some stuff correct, remember that the drill sergeant in full metal jacket was an actual marine himself.

I get tired of hero worship in the country of who I would consider some of the biggest ads holes on the planet.  Not all of them are honorable and worthy of praise.  Some of them are complete dirt bags.

I believe that the defendant just pushed this guy too hard on an unguarded platform in Chicago to defend himself, but we worship military veterans because apparently they are all heroes.  No offense, but when these guys finally come out of the marines, they are ill equipped for civilian life.  Look at the statistics of domestic abuse and suicide among military vets.  It's pretty fucking staggering.  Military vets are not all heroes and angels, we send them overseas kill people only to have them come back damaged and in some cases deranged.  Look at who Trump pardoned not a couple months ago.  I'm not saying all vets are bad, but I could see how they come back affected.
