americanairlines,fnhszlf,t1_fndo8zh,1586968320.0,I called AA and I am relaying the information they gave me. They told me I have until the day of my flight to cancel and then would need to use that amount towards another flight by the end of the year. It is kind of shitty and scam like because you‚Äôll end up spending more money for a second flight just to use the voucher.
americanairlines,fndnops,t3_g16boy,1586873977.0,"You have until the end of the year to use the voucher/amount you spent. Also, if they change your flight by even an hour the entire flight is refundable."
Renters,fmbk4pn,t1_fmai106,1585927957.0,I honestly would just get a note from your doctor stating that it is your emotional support animal. Most doctors have no problem doing so and then your landlord cannot legally charge you fees. That‚Äôs what I did for my pup here in Michigan.

boxycharm,fj6ci9g,t1_fj691l3,1583067166.0,Their IG says they will be charging the second half for Luxe later today.
Renters,fizg9jn,t3_f8u809,1582862042.0,Nope. If you forgot to notify the electric company that you are no longer living there the bill is your responsibility. You can reach out to the current tenants and hope that they will make it right - but just be aware that they are not obligated to.
Renters,fizg54z,t3_fan8tp,1582861952.0,This is petty. Wash your car and move on.
boxycharm,fivtl7c,t1_fivpvtk,1582767763.0,I 100% agree. Another good tip is to use a credit card rather than a debit card for Boxy. Credit cards are more likely to side with you & return your money!
boxycharm,fivo7vc,t1_fivj0w8,1582764404.0,Of course! Literally all you need to do is either go into your bank or google how to dispute it online (since this may be different for each bank) and provide the receipt/proof. Show that it is the wrong amount of ounces and not what you paid for and when your bank disputes the charges Boxy will be forced to refund you since they didn‚Äôt actually give you what you paid for. Honestly you shouldn‚Äôt even need to go this far. The threat of it alone alarms Boxy. I assume that there is a consequence if hundreds of people are disputing charges from them and honestly I‚Äôm surprised more people don‚Äôt keep them in check with this.
boxycharm,fivijt9,t3_fa0mc9,1582760982.0,All you need to do is state that you will dispute this with your bank (which you are 100% able and should do) unless they make it right. I‚Äôve done this multiple times and each time they have fixed their ‚Äúmistake‚Äù.

Renters,fhon6mv,t3_f44i00,1581765852.0,Honestly the ability to be able to remove yourself from the situation because you were leasing month to month is such a blessing in this situation. I‚Äôm in Michigan and when the last house I rented went up for sale we still had four or so months of our lease. Landlords only legally need to give 24 hours notice to show the home and there were multiple showings each week. It was exhausting.

Renters,fgcniyw,t3_exslih,1580674423.0,Yes. This should be a dealbreaker. My current landlord walks a fine line with neglect and if I would have known prior to moving in and dumping hundreds of dollars into making the place my own - I never would have stayed.

boxycharm,fcr407q,t3_eihq7u,1577896450.0,Did they say why it is being shipped separately? This seems like false advertising since they posted so many photos including the palette in the box and the captions literally state that it would be in there. üôÑ

FireflyFestival,fcahxel,t1_fcacr2a,1577569542.0,Thanks for pointing this out. A bunch of people are going to downvote my comments but the reality is totems ruin the festival for other people.

FireflyFestival,fca89xz,t1_fc9ojyo,1577564569.0,I‚Äôm really not trying to sound like a jerk but maybe consider not making one. I know it is probably an unpopular opinion but no matter how large or small a totem is - it ruins someone‚Äôs view that paid just as much money to be at the festival.

Renters,f8dc6jm,t3_e0ajos,1574485082.0,I would only pay the monthly amount stated in the signed lease and place the remaining amount the landlord is asking for into an escrow savings account (to be safe). The apartment complex would need to file suit to demand the remaining rent. If the judge rules in your favor you would then be safe to stay there the remainder of the lease at the original monthly price. Keep in mind that when your lease is over your landlord is not required to sign another agreement or honor that price. If the judge rules in your landlord‚Äôs favor you would then be required to immediately pay the difference in rent to avoid eviction. Hope this helps and definitely browse the internet for Arizona tenant and landlord rights!

I won't hold my breath for the Mac. I have been subscribed for about a year and a half and have never received one of their products. I do, however, receive cheap ($3 drug store quality) eyeliner pencils from Boxy all the time. Do you know if it is a liquid eyeliner or a pencil?"

I will say I am completely bored with all the neutral palettes, blush and face palettes we have been receiving lately.
