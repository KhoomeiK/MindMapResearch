FireflyFestival,fodm8us,t3_g23exp,1587686437.0,I got 2/3 of my refund today. One of my payments were missing. Emailed them and hopefully they resolve it quickly.
americanairlines,fnhszlf,t1_fndo8zh,1586968320.0,I called AA and I am relaying the information they gave me. They told me I have until the day of my flight to cancel and then would need to use that amount towards another flight by the end of the year. It is kind of shitty and scam like because you’ll end up spending more money for a second flight just to use the voucher.
americanairlines,fndnops,t3_g16boy,1586873977.0,"You have until the end of the year to use the voucher/amount you spent. Also, if they change your flight by even an hour the entire flight is refundable."
Renters,fmbk4pn,t1_fmai106,1585927957.0,I honestly would just get a note from your doctor stating that it is your emotional support animal. Most doctors have no problem doing so and then your landlord cannot legally charge you fees. That’s what I did for my pup here in Michigan.
Renters,fm9s6pc,t1_fm9s076,1585875367.0,"The pet fee and/or deposit. If it's not on the agreement it is not legal.   


They won't be able to claim it was a ""verbal contract"" either since you did not have any knowledge of these fees prior to signing."

boxycharm,fk9bj6f,t3_fh6qc5,1583972690.0,I received the same variation and I love it! For sure email customer service about the PMD though. I had a similar experience with a serum being opened once and they sent me a replacement ASAP.
boxycharm,fj6ci9g,t1_fj691l3,1583067166.0,Their IG says they will be charging the second half for Luxe later today.
Renters,fizg9jn,t3_f8u809,1582862042.0,Nope. If you forgot to notify the electric company that you are no longer living there the bill is your responsibility. You can reach out to the current tenants and hope that they will make it right - but just be aware that they are not obligated to.
Renters,fizg54z,t3_fan8tp,1582861952.0,This is petty. Wash your car and move on.
boxycharm,fivtl7c,t1_fivpvtk,1582767763.0,I 100% agree. Another good tip is to use a credit card rather than a debit card for Boxy. Credit cards are more likely to side with you & return your money!
boxycharm,fivo7vc,t1_fivj0w8,1582764404.0,Of course! Literally all you need to do is either go into your bank or google how to dispute it online (since this may be different for each bank) and provide the receipt/proof. Show that it is the wrong amount of ounces and not what you paid for and when your bank disputes the charges Boxy will be forced to refund you since they didn’t actually give you what you paid for. Honestly you shouldn’t even need to go this far. The threat of it alone alarms Boxy. I assume that there is a consequence if hundreds of people are disputing charges from them and honestly I’m surprised more people don’t keep them in check with this.
boxycharm,fivijt9,t3_fa0mc9,1582760982.0,All you need to do is state that you will dispute this with your bank (which you are 100% able and should do) unless they make it right. I’ve done this multiple times and each time they have fixed their “mistake”.

Renters,fhon6mv,t3_f44i00,1581765852.0,Honestly the ability to be able to remove yourself from the situation because you were leasing month to month is such a blessing in this situation. I’m in Michigan and when the last house I rented went up for sale we still had four or so months of our lease. Landlords only legally need to give 24 hours notice to show the home and there were multiple showings each week. It was exhausting.
BeautyBoxes,fh9bacq,t3_f1vbsx,1581377287.0,I’m hoping for this variation! Fingers crossed!

Renters,fgcnswo,t1_fgcniyw,1580674517.0,I should also add that my place is a good $300-$400 cheaper monthly than others like it in my area. If it seems to good to be true - it probably is.
Renters,fgcniyw,t3_exslih,1580674423.0,Yes. This should be a dealbreaker. My current landlord walks a fine line with neglect and if I would have known prior to moving in and dumping hundreds of dollars into making the place my own - I never would have stayed. It’s not worth feeling unsafe at not at peace in your home.

FireflyFestival,fgbtcq3,t1_fgbshto,1580665969.0,"That’s fair! Sorry if that came off rude. The only thing I really saw security taking from attendees (once they were actually in the festival) was weed. I don’t smoke so it didn’t change my time, but if you do sneak that in I would try to be discrete so it’s not confiscated."
FireflyFestival,fgbs309,t1_fgbcg4k,1580665640.0,"My cousin lives on the same street as Firefly. We snuck emergency cliff bars in our bras and brought camelbacks. We ate a good breakfast prior to attending each day and with the cliff bars we only ended up needing to purchase one meal each day. Total lifesavers.

FireflyFestival,fdrgvc0,t1_fdr1mj8,1578684366.0,Tickets being purchased elsewhere is the only part of this that makes me nervous. If sales were significantly lower last year and too many people attend other festivals rather than Firefly I’m not sure they will continue.

boxycharm,fcvro7k,t3_ehx1fq,1578008567.0,How did you get the Luxe the first month? I honestly would have bought a second one if I would have known. This was my favorite Luxe yet!
boxycharm,fcr407q,t3_eihq7u,1577896450.0,Did they say why it is being shipped separately? This seems like false advertising since they posted so many photos including the palette in the box and the captions literally state that it would be in there. 🙄
boxycharm,fcg4tig,t1_fcfosnd,1577636469.0,"It’s supposed to be the Too Faced Peach Palette, the Cover FX face palette, the Celestial Thunder Palette by Dominque Cosmetics, the Elemis oil, a liquid eyeshadow I believe and a lip exfoliator. They do state in their posts though that you MAY receive that variation though so I wouldn’t be surprised if they have utilized the advertisement to attempt to sell more boxes. Nothing is actually guaranteed."
boxycharm,fcfn3z1,t3_eh3x61,1577631890.0,Did you make sure to use the code too?! It’ll be the FOMO box and with the code you SHOULD receive three palettes. I ended up going in halves with my friend for the box just because I wanted the Cover FX face palette. I dropped mine and it was my favorite summer palette!
FireflyFestival,fcbgp6s,t1_fcbfhq6,1577586642.0,"I am not normally one to complain about something fun like this, but if no one talks about it how is the festival supposed to know it is/was an issue? Ya know?"
FireflyFestival,fcahxel,t1_fcacr2a,1577569542.0,Thanks for pointing this out. A bunch of people are going to downvote my comments but the reality is totems ruin the festival for other people. They really shouldn’t be allowed. & no one wants to pay $200-$300 to not be able to see because someone selfishly wanted a totem.
FireflyFestival,fca89xz,t1_fc9ojyo,1577564569.0,I’m really not trying to sound like a jerk but maybe consider not making one. I know it is probably an unpopular opinion but no matter how large or small a totem is - it ruins someone’s view that paid just as much money to be at the festival. I really do wish they would just ban the things. If you end up bringing one please try to at the very least be conscious of the people behind you during sets.
FireflyFestival,fc9ogrh,t3_egt49t,1577555767.0,"Last year I am 99% sure the festival rules stated that totems were not allowed but somehow people had them. If you are going to make one, cool, but please be conscious of those standing around you as well. Totems are fun - but you don’t want to ruin anyone else’s view or experience."

LifeAfterNarcissism,fbwcmw3,t3_eel4ya,1577146410.0,My older sister is notorious for this. She operates on her own timeline and has absolutely no regard for anyone else's time. But if anyone treats her the way she treats others she snaps about respect. Any time I have attempted to discuss this issue (& similar hypocritical situations) I have either been bullied to believe that I am not being empathetic enough or put down for other issues in an attempt to divert the negative attention.

I mentally black out until I calm down and get very stuck on why I was upset. It’s honestly best for whoever I am upset with to allow me to calm down and give me space before trying to reason with me. If they don’t it’s about as useful as talking to a brick wall. I haven’t really found a solution for it yet, but it has been less frequent now that I cut communication with people that trigger me repeatedly."

Renters,f8dc6jm,t3_e0ajos,1574485082.0,I would only pay the monthly amount stated in the signed lease and place the remaining amount the landlord is asking for into an escrow savings account (to be safe). The apartment complex would need to file suit to demand the remaining rent. If the judge rules in your favor you would then be safe to stay there the remainder of the lease at the original monthly price. Keep in mind that when your lease is over your landlord is not required to sign another agreement or honor that price. If the judge rules in your landlord’s favor you would then be required to immediately pay the difference in rent to avoid eviction. Hope this helps and definitely browse the internet for Arizona tenant and landlord rights!

She did not have the motherly bond she was meant to with me and as an infant I almost died multiple times as a result. In my opinion it is better to admit that you are not ready or cannot handle a child at that time than be neglectful or a terrible parent. Try to see the positive in this and know that your daughter is lucky and will be grateful that she has you.

I won't hold my breath for the Mac. I have been subscribed for about a year and a half and have never received one of their products. I do, however, receive cheap ($3 drug store quality) eyeliner pencils from Boxy all the time. Do you know if it is a liquid eyeliner or a pencil?"

If it's not received (especially after completing the survey asking for this) I will be very upset. 

I will say I am completely bored with all the neutral palettes, blush and face palettes we have been receiving lately. I understand fun palettes aren't everyone's favorite, but I'd love to see more variety and I absolutely loved the Party Animal palette we received last year. Ever since though - it's been all different shades of brown. I can only take so much, lol.

Also, I absolutely LOVED the skin care box. I'm hoping they will do that again but we'll see."

My parents stopped physically abusing me in these situations when I made it clear that the police would be called, regardless of the situation, if even a finger was laid on me again. This was about three years ago and no one has pushed, shoved, hit or thrown me since.

I’m also bipolar. If you ever need someone to vent to just message me. 🙂 As far as coping, there is a Bipolar subreddit that is great and I highly recommend both a therapist and psychiatrist."
