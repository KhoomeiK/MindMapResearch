>it cant be cured

while it may not be easily cured, I am inclined to think ASD can be managed, somewhat like diabetes.   ""Balovaptan"" is being investigated, and sulforaphane is supposed to help.   Many other therapies exist.   

If you still want to consider euthanasia, you might look at [*A Slip Of The Keyboard*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Slip_of_the_Keyboard) which includes some about how Terry Pratchett ended his life ( Dignitas ).

If you contact the psychologists, you might ask about a 'charitable write-off' or 'sliding scale'.   Some charge less to those with reduced incomes.   

Lastly, there are 'studies'.   Medical research where they may diagnose you for free, as part of testing a new drug or therapy.
