My CURRENT problem is the height of the plants in the system. They’re getting a little too tall so that they’ll be avoiding their light source soon, so keep in mind how tall you want to keep the plants and how you’ll prune them, etc. For some reason I’ve had a lot easier of a time w bigger plants like peppers and cucumbers and not so much w herbs.

They don’t know for sure whether it was purposeful or not, but let me tell you, as someone who didn’t even have the chance to know him, I miss him. It’s tragic that he resulted to drugs to fight his demons, and his coping mechanism ultimately killed him. I would give anything to sit down and talk to him for a while. Whenever someone says “who would you have coffee with if you could choose anyone living or dead?” I always choose my uncle. PLEASE take care of yourself and stay away from the drugs. Remember that you came down feeling worse than before. Someone that you have no idea about may want to know you. PLEASE, for my sake, don’t become my uncle. Please take care of yourself. Someone out there is gonna miss you."
