Based on currently public information, this would appear to be  just an empty threat, in an attempt to put more pressure on the law firm  to pay the ransom demand.

I mean, I've seen this story posted multiple times all over multiple subreddits with 'Trump' prominently shown in the headline. It's clearly meant to be an attention grabber even if they can't deliver on the threat and an effective one at that"

Because there is no electrical connection between the primary and secondary—just the transformer—the output voltage is electrically isolated.

If the assets are remotely stored then doing a partial reverse engineer to download the assets directly would help though it would be a copyright issue to rehost those assets because they weren't part of the client and had to be remotely downloaded. If it's a webapp, this process will probably go quicker than if it's a native binary where you may also run into DRM issues. If you're doing full packet capture, this may be unnecessary if the asset downloads are part of the capture (clear the clients cache to force the assets to download). Providing a dump of your cache folder for the game might also help

If the client is a native binary and the communications are encrypted, then you'll have a probably have a hell of a time trying to MITM the connection to capture packets.
