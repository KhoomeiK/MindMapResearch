As a child, she had a horrible teacher that wouldn't let anyone talk amongst themselves or even go to the bathroom.

I think about shit from 10 years ago. I'm sure that no one else even thought twice about whatever I did or said; but it haunts me. It's actually probably very narcissistic to think that the small things we do or say would really affect anyone else as much as we think."

To see it from a Londoner's POV would be so cool! I've lived in Chicago and now Brooklyn, but California has been my fave! And traveling alone is the bomb. I went to Disneyland by myself a few years ago while my boyfriend was at a conference. I had the best time.

Oh, and we went to London (and Bath and Brussels day trips) for ten fucking days three years ago. It was exhausting but we saw so much. I fell in love. 

Cheers!"

One time at the end of an episode, she commented on how pretty much every scene started with the opening of a door and ended with closing a door. I started to notice it a lot after that. Very novel and a great tool to start and end something in a symbolic way.

Anywho, yes, I notice that now :)"

1200isplentyketo,fnl7fub,t3_g2c8yo,1587048445.0,"I have a cheat day once a week, on Saturdays. But ""cheating"" consists of eating fruit, pasta, beans, potatoes (also drinking beer :) and not tracking...things that aren't horrible for me but that I miss eating on a day to day basis and can't easily replicate to my satisfaction on keto. I'm maintaining my weight now, but even when I had some to lose I would experience a gain of a couple of pounds, but then it would come off quickly usually with a pound or two more coming off to boot. 

My cheat day this week will consist of pasta salad with everything in it being really healthy but using REAL PASTA! And nachos, again, everything healthy but using REAL TORTILLA CHIPS! These are my favorite things and getting to eat them once in awhile makes me happy.

Of course this is just my experience and I know it can be a slippery slope for people. But knowing that something I crave is open to me in just a week keeps me on track to be vigilant the other six days of the week."
Anxiety,fmhd6fp,t3_fv6vhu,1586075319.0,"My anxiety causes me to shut down; I feel like there is too much to do and therefore I do nothing. Feel like a loser, get depressed, do nothing, rinse, repeat. 

Now I feel like everyone is stressed and worried all the time. It makes me feel less alone and so I've felt more confident and have been actually able to get stuff done and look forward to waking up every day and accomplishing something. Its like the pressure is off for a while.

It sucks that it takes others people having anxiety to make me feel better about myself. But that is what is happening *shrug*"
