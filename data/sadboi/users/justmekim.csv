diabetes_t2,ffulflf,t3_ev91jv,1580244437.0,"That's very old school. 

I started in June 2019 w/ an A1C of 14.9. Woooo really bad! Through a very low carb diet, walking for exercise and .75 mg of Trulicity, I dropped 28 lbs and got my A1C to 8.9 in 3 mos.

I continue the low carb diet, walking & Trulicity but have added the occasional sweet treat and 3 mos later got my A1C down to 6.3.

My Dr said if I can get my A1C to 4.5 and maintain it for 3 mos, he will consider taking me off the Trulicity. 

So no, the Metformin does not have to be or life."

AskReddit,f50e07y,t3_dlxiry,1571925974.0,"When I was 13, I was selected to be on my softball league's All Star team. It was customary to TP and decorate the Coaches house the night before the first game. So we all meet up at the park then hop into the bed of a parent's truck (it was the 80's) to go to the coaches house to do our thing.

We finish wrapping the house and get back in the truck to go back to the meet up spot at the park. I'm the only one who has a parent there waiting to pick me up. I asked ""Aren't y'all all going home too?""

They all reply ""No, we're all going to Cindy's house. She's having a party.""

I was the.....only one on the team.......not invited. I am 51 now & it still stings. I also use it as a teachable moment about excluding people for my 14 yr old son"

They decide to remove my spleen as nothing else is telling. My spleen goes off to the pathologist who finds it full of granulomas. 

Ends up my lymph node biopsy showed granulomas but no one was convinced it was NOT Lymphoma."
