transformers,fc5v9ug,t3_egdmxi,1577466651.0,"On Sixshot, I painted in the wheel rims and both sides of the tank treads on his upper arms. I also painted the treads on his lower arms, the bottoms of the wolf paws white, and the Headmaster's robot mode to resemble Jack from the *Headmasters* anime. The robot mode details on the Headmaster aren't a 1:1 match, but they're close enough.

On Chromedome, I wasn't really concerned with IDW accuracy anywhere besides the head, so I painted in the back vents and wheel rims of the car mode. As for the head, I meant to paint the visor yellow, but that color wouldn't show up well; I ended up painting the visor gold, as that was close enough to yellow while still being visible. Lastly, the Headmaster robot mode received a painted face, head, and the outside of the arms, though there is wear and tear damage to the paint if you look closely.

On Rewind, I just painted in the little recording light on the side of his head and called it a day.

Last but not least, I painted the inner arms, feet, and backpack on Rung."
