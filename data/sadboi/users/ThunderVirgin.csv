May it be mental or physical abuse. Let me allow you to answer your questions

**Why does no one love me when I love them so much?:** People do love you, just find the right ones, it may take time. We are 7,800,000,000 different people on earth. Look to yourself and see how many new ones you interact with every day.

**Am I capable of being loved?:** Hell yeah. We are 7,800,000,000 unique personalities on earth, why the hell would not a single soul love you? Usually grumpy, violent men will get attracted to beautiful women and make them feel bad, like in your case.

You are way more than you may think. I'm also really lonely but I try to look into the perspective of how many people we are on earth every day, and from there come with the conclusion that if I keep looking, there's no way in hell I'll be lonely for the entirety of my life.

Seriously. That's big balls in my book."

lonely,fmo2zu2,t1_fmo1ipf,1586243510.0,"My psychiatrists did not outright say the same answer, but they all pointed toward that it was my self-doubt that was playing a big factor in this. I wrote it saying that they all said the same thing to simplify it all as the text got pretty lengthy heh.

About the talking thing, yeah, I've been there, done that. I've tried but they're just so toxic that I don't think I'll be able to do it again with my mental position right now. Whenever we have a discussion they all start throwing stuff like ""f\*\*\*\*\* st\*\*\*\* idi\*\*"" and stuff like that, so if I come and say ""I feel like you're all toxic and bad people""... yeah, you probably get it.

What I've thought about doing is that I'd send them a text message or recorded voice message in the end of our school years (We still have one year to go together) explaining what happened and everything so I don't leave them empty-handed in the end. If I'm strong enough then I might as well talk to them straight up."

Mind to drop your twitch name here? I'll surely drop by the next stream I'm available to see how you do things ;)

Yeah sure, I can send you a notification on reddit when I begin. That'd be nice."
