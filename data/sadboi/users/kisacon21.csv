bipolar,fqname0,t3_gjd0ur,1589491497.0,rings true I've been wondering myself lately about this. Am I really in a good mood? Do I even know what it is when I'm in a good mood or is it just hypermania? I'm just going to take the good with the bad if it feels good it's good that feels bad look into it and try to correct it the best I can to be the best person and good person and spread the Good karma the best I can
wedding,fqna7jf,t1_fqjloe8,1589491296.0,yes I'm really sure he wants to get married and I want to get married too. That app since then game has opened up a lot. Dialogue between us to I may have jumped the gun in expressing my concern but all of the posts including yours have really helped me figure things out and think things through.
Marriage,fqb8a9f,t3_ghq7qg,1589232327.0,I can relate to I barely found a male sex toy in my husband sock drawer over the weekend. I went through all the emotions and realized same thing sex is infrequent as I haven't been feeling well lately and he has needs. At least I know that he is doing this instead of going somewhere else and being unfaithful.
DungeonsAndDragons,fpkodj7,t3_gdrt6x,1588698228.0,I'll be honest I haven't poured through the comments in case it was already mentioned. We found a game called dinner & dragons if you want them or simplified way of teaching them how to play. Just a suggestion.
BariatricSurgery,fp2l270,t3_gasvow,1588263592.0,It could be some form of acid reflux. Do you still have your gallbladder as well?
WhitePeopleTwitter,fp2kmq9,t3_gau86u,1588263382.0,I tell them that I am older than the internet. Every time I say this to a younger person it looks like they're mine is blown.
mentalillness,fohhsb3,t3_g7h3tk,1587766203.0,does physical grounding ever help like touching an object and closing your eyes and using all your senses one by one? Helps with my anxiety for sure. It's just a suggestion any of your coping skills is worth trying. And if you feel like they're not working try different ones Google is a plethora of them. Your kitty is doing a good job and so are you
GastricBypass,fo7b0wk,t1_fo6jilt,1587575282.0,Thank you for this. This is exactly what I was asking others out there if they had other ideas appreciate it so much.
GastricBypass,fo7arux,t1_fo5dylo,1587575158.0,I never knew about slider foods. And now I'm aware that I had been doing exactly that to cheat my way through it all. I really appreciate your idea that you sent to me thank you.
GastricBypass,fo7a8m7,t1_fo5my34,1587574900.0,Noted. Hey thanks for the motivation!!!!!
GastricBypass,fo5cetp,t3_g5rppk,1587522326.0,Fiber! Plenty of water! Good LEAN protein. Keep you're guy moving. Research the hell out of your surgeon too.
relationship_advice,fnp9nth,t3_g2ybe5,1587141667.0,Report him! Let him explain himself to a police officer he assaulted you and I don't care where you live that is against the law. Would you have called the cops if he punched you same difference good luck to you and I hope you feel better you are worth more than a slap in the face for no reason.
GastricBypass,fnlcs9g,t1_fniwj76,1587051261.0,I don't know if you know this already but one thing to really monitor in pregnancy since we have to eat high protein is protein in your urine as well I'm pretty sure your doctor is doing the best I had great sugar but had a lot of protein in my urine which causes concern for kidneys as is also with the glucose test
GastricBypass,fniwj76,t3_g1sd4i,1586987619.0,I did the same thing and tried the glucose formula. But it made me dump. So I had to stop my doctor was completely understanding. He just kept monitoring my glucose with fingerprint Pricks every visit
Marriage,fn0vyxz,t1_flqo1rq,1586549814.0,Thank you I am so lucky
Marriage,fn0vxwd,t1_fltxlt0,1586549798.0,Absolutely!
BipolarReddit,fn08lco,t1_fmz12o7,1586537388.0,Same here. I'd take the side effects of the drug knowing I can stay a little more focused. Especially at work where my performance is closely monitored.
SaltLakeCity,fm9wkls,t3_ftoz0m,1585878196.0,Looks like he is smiling
funny,fm9whuq,t3_ftuf2c,1585878148.0,May I steal! Rofl ðŸ˜‰
BipolarReddit,fm4pqlo,t3_ft1zs5,1585758549.0,I've had Ativan before and it's great for anxiety if it's your first dose I recommend cutting the pill in half just to see how it feels and then maybe in 2 to 3 hours take the other one? That is what I did to be safe
Marriage,fkrzv2p,t1_fkrtqbe,1584479362.0,you're right I should have I guess I was too emotional when I posted that to think it through. And my future post I plan on thinking it through so everybody has context thank you though for the comment
bipolar,fkrsk7k,t1_fkodsoa,1584475177.0,Hello Croatia! Living the dream taking the meds all day everyday to have some kind of even my emotions and a good head on my shoulders.
Marriage,fkrsedr,t1_fkoi75l,1584475085.0,we are struggling financially every penny goes to bills and rent so we can live with the roof are over our head and food in our stomachs. We don't need much in this world but sometimes it would be nice to go out to dinner orbowling or a nice small date we tried a budget this but in the end after I get my paycheck I end up with about $30 to live on for 2 weeks. it's cheap for him to eat all he ever eats his cereal but for me I have to stick to a strict diet because I've had a surgery to lose weight and I need a lot of protein or my hair will fall out. I just wish he would just go and try to find another job that would fulfill him and help him with his self-hate about not being able to contribute as more than he can.I understand the whole situation and I'm grateful we both have jobs knowing where we come from in now being in recovery.but again I just can't help resenting him for not even trying to find something else to fulfill his well-being and give a boost to our income
relationship_advice,fj1stj4,t3_fb208n,1582926985.0,be honest with yourself. Were you being your true self online? If so he likes you for you for sure. I think it's normal for you to have butterflies about meeting in person for the first time. But again just be honest with yourself because nobody likes a fake in the beginning only to find out everything you told them was false and you're a whole new person they have to get to know and figure out.
relationship_advice,fj1its3,t3_fayo4k,1582920976.0,All I'm going to say is you never know unless you try. And unless you don't try you'll never know.
greysanatomy,fhtza6l,t3_f3kivd,1581880053.0,"Beautiful dance!! Aww. But Shonda, YOU'RE KILLING ME! You know what you did."
trashy,ffx7fwn,t3_evlvw4,1580319329.0,I can't believe that disgusting behavior and I was wondering if she ever turned around and realize you were recording her or realize that you were even there watching?
