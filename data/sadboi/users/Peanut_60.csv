depression,fay8jti,t3_clue8y,1576396589.0,"I feel the same about suicide being inevitable and now at 60 years old I know that it is my way. I am having a much harder time with each year I grow older and I try to live in the moment and not think about the future because there is only one thing I see and that is suicide. At 60 and going through depression for close to fifty years and probably 50 jobs it is hard to keep the depression at bay. It seems I have a very drug resistant form of depression. So I had Electroconvulsive Therapy or all so ECT it is a mild electric shock to your brain. It helped for about a year but it all so destroyed 20 or more years of memories. The hundred or more different drugs in most case made me worse to the point of to suicide attempts first was over nine years ago and the second was all most one year to the day after and this one I planned it out. My job was going down the tube fast I was in a slow process of recovering from lower back surgery my second one my life was severe pain 24 7 and I had some painkillers and 13 other different drugs so I skip pills lots of pain pills, Adderall, sleeping pills, Xanax, muscle relaxers,and more. I save up a couple hundred pills some for most of my drugs and took them all. I overdosed and was brought back and not with Narcan it was the old bag em and shock em. Talk about depressed I reached a whole new level of depression this confirmed in my mind that I have a destiny and it will happen much sooner then I have planned. When I was 9 it  all started and has progressed to a short time away from the third and final suicide attempt. It does not get easier with age the depression it seems to get harder to control. It will be much easier to overdose again I felt no pain when I overdose it was just like going into a deep sleep I was very comfortable and pain free my mind was clear and sharp and it was so close. During the end time before being shocked and brought back I had and experience that was real there is life after death and it is good much better then the body I am in. I at 60 am feeling the insane things I did as a kid , a young man, and a man. Motorcycle wrecks bunches you are not learning if you not at your limit and crashing so fly crash and learn I wanted to crash and die. Time to be serious if your young from 12 or 13 fight take all the help you can get so you can change, even from that age all the way up to around 50 There is a lot of help out there's a lot new drugs new therapies new physical tests like MRI or CT scans that might lead to a lot of help and understanding of many things that can help.  Don't get to the point u spend time everyday idealizing suicide or acting out the steps you are going to take I can't turn it around I. I have a bad back ad live with severe pain and nothing to help like a pain killer. But those aren't the only drugs that work. I take a blood pressure and a antidepressnt drug and some good sleeping pills that will get it done no problem but this time might hurt but there will not be cops, firemen, and emt's around .     i came to peace with this when I was dead from my last overdose I met some beings and I look for word to returning. I bought Christmas gifts and it's a good time to disappear no mistakes have any one around just go to sleep. to every one that reads this catch the depressed when they are young build a support group build their confidence and their emotional IQ lead the young to better thoughts better actions and a high emotional intelligence so they can put depression out of their lives."
