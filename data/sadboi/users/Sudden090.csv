Going on a year of being single out of an 8 year. She was my best friend and I didn't really have a circle outside of that. I started to get out more, go to more shows and work more. But then the lock downs happened and I find myself feeling more alone than ever. I didn't think it would ever be this taxing. It just feels horrifying not know how long it will be before I get another chance. And I feel selfish feeling is way, but its taking its toll for sure.
