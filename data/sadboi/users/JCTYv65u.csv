My brain, while dreaming doesn't seem to see the obvious contradiction here, something similar might be going on with you guys as people often wake directly from REM sleep, and are therefore in a dream-like state, so your brain might not realise there cannot be a cat, because you don't own one or they're not allowed in your room. If you have had previous experiences of cats settling down in bed with you, your brain might create such feelings similar I think to how amputees feel phantom limbs.

No you're not way out of your mind, what you're describing is what humans probably evolved to do, some isolated tribes still treat it as the norm, and medieval europeans did similar too.

So what you're probably looking for is Biphasic and polyphasic sleep:  
Biphasic = Going to sleep twice within 24 hours  
Polyphasic = Going to sleep multiple times within 24 hours  


If you are going to be using either Biphasic sleeping or Polyphasic sleeping you will want to make sure you wake up during or preferably towards the end of REM sleep, which is the stage of sleep where most vivid dreams take place.  


Below is a comparison of the different sleep stages (purely anecdotal):  
Name - Order - Freshness if woken up during - Heaviness - Overall freshness for the day  
Stage1 - first (first 5 minutes of sleep) - 9 - very light - 2  
Stage2 - second - 7 - normal - 7  
Stage3 - third - 4 - heavy - 9  
Stage4 - fourth - 2 - heavy - 10  
REM - fifth (occurs normally after around 90 minutes) - 10 - light - 4  


Sorry I'm way too tired to do maths right now so im going to leave that for you,  
so when planning how long you want to sleep you probably want to complete at least one full cycle (stages1,2,3,4 and REM) which will last for about 100 minutes, bearing in mind after each cycle the REM stage of sleep gets longer, lasting more than an hour sometimes which is why after a long sleep you probably woke up directly after a dream in REM sleep and therefore feel refreshed in the morning.  


Because in your case you wake up and go to sleep a significant time later you are probably resetting your sleep cycles each time, meaning shorter REM sleep. This is mostly a positive as it means you are getting more refreshing heavy sleep (stages3 and 4), meaning you can get away with less sleep than someone sleeping in one session per day and feel just as refreshed, however this means you're less likely to wake up during REM sleep and may feel more tired in the morning and during your commute to work... Nothing a coffee can't fix though!  


One thing to add, try not to consume any caffeine within 5 hours of going to bed, and make sure not to drink any alcohol to help you go to bed, sleeping with alcohol actually decreases the quality of sleep and you won't feel as refreshed. If you need help getting to sleep (like are not tired enough) you can use piriton allergy tablets or something similar, they make you feel drowsy and have little to no side effects, but don't pair them with alcohol or you will wake up inside a cupboard at 5am with no memory of what happened.  


Anyways, I would appreciate it if you helped me with my problem please,  
So I'm terrified of falling asleep because I'm scared of being unconscious, so I am always extremely sleep deprived. Can you please tell me why you like sleep, want to get more and why I am wrong for being scared of being unconscious? Thanks, any help is greatly appreciated."

If you can get sleep don't mess with it and treat sleep with respect, you don't want to end up with somniphobia, my life has been ruined over the past 4 weeks, im 16... I'm about to buy weed tomorrow to get myself to sleep, I have nothing to lose at this point."

I guess at the end of the day this is character building, and I hope it pays off in the end, this suffering cant be for nothing.  


I'm trying to change my perception of sleeping by overwriting thoughts, basically creating false memories to overwrite the old thoughts that are negative. If witnesses can be tricked into providing false memories then surely I can trick my subconscious right?  


Sorry for the confused layout, I'm literally figuring out what room i'm in every few minutes but I think someone mentioned I should do some meditation, harvarddelux, I was looking into the wim hof method and was wondering if his method had any credit when it comes to relaxation.  


Another one of my problems i found is that when I'm going to bed my head sometimes feels like its spinning and my internal vision like pitch black with my eyes closed changes brightness slightly somehow, when something weird happens I say to myself oh yah its working, im about to fall asleep any second now... 5 seconds later nothing has happened and I sddenly get racing thoughts and some fresh adrenaline."

I am probably not in a fit state to be on reddit right now, I'm on the verge of falling asleep, soon to have been awake for 3 nights in a row... Waiting for this weed to arrive before I try and sleep again because honestly I'm terrified. My plan is to get exposed to more voluntary and positive thoughts and experiences with sleep while high, for my subconscious to eventually get used to it and let me sleep like a normal human being."

Try not to get comfortable on a sofa or anything.

As for finding it harder to learn, what a lack of sleep will do is mess with your muscle coordination, balance and spacial awareness. I think I read somewhere that 24hours without sleep is just as bad as being too drunk to drive. Attention span, IQ and reaction speed are also negatively impacted by a lack of sleep. So although you will be performing slightly worse than usual you shouldn't be forgetting anything significant you learned through the day.  


Try and get the sleep you need (7-8 hours for most adults), but it's ok to have one or two bad nights now and then. Good luck with your dancing."
sleep,eu83adq,t1_eu82ujl,1563548788.0,"Oh I think I understand why you want to cry on command,  
crying is not a good thing to get into the habit of in order to tire yourself out to get to sleep, instead its sort of making the best of a bad situation if you are already crying. You could end up more awake depending on how your brain reacts. Also who wants to admit they cry themselves to sleep.  


Your brain could also associate sleep with stress and crying and you could become a somniphobe, trust me its not fun and my life has been 75% ruined within 2 weeks."

I would reccomend NOT doing this, crying is only good if you are actually worried or sad about something, but if you are fine and happy then crying won't do you any good.

&#x200B;

1 (not very effective), curl your mouth like you are crying then slam your eyes shut until they start to water, then start to hyperventilate for a bit, then turn that into short and sharp breaths, make sure you are inhaling through your mouth but exhaling through both your mouth and nose. Getting into a fetal position and turning off the lights can help speed up the process.  


2 (more effective), aswell as everything in method 1, think about a traumatic experience or a traumatic event, maybe a family member or a pet you have lost, someone you know got an injury or illness etc... Keep repeating to yourself something like 'i will never see them again' or 'they're gone forever'.  


Again, if you are having to TRY to cry on purpose then you're probably not said enough and crying won't do you any good. Crying is something that should come naturally and should not be forced, but then again I don't know what situation you're in so who am I to tell you what to do."
sleep,eu80yds,t1_eu6w1io,1563547371.0,"I'm not an expert so don't take my word for it but,AFAIK the brain can only hold about 7 things in temporary memory, try play this game: [https://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/number-memory](https://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/number-memory), you have to remember a string of numbers that gets longer after each round and see how far you can go, my highest is 13 because I got lucky with some repeat numbers and could read them out in my head as a sort of song.

Anything that doesn't go into temporary memory is sent to permanent memory, AKA you learn it, and AFAIK all sleep does is reinforce important memories and forget and clean up after irrelavent ones, memories that you didn't think about since learning them are more likely to be destroyed, but as memories are not single things, and rather a set of bridges between many neurones you might half remember something or if you have ever said, 'i know this, just give me a second' chances are sleeping has accidentally erased a bit of your memory, and your brain is piecing together what it can find, which is also why a hint, like the first 3 letters of a word can make you remember it and it seems so obvious.

Sleeping also organises memories and tries to make sense of your experiences during the day, thats what most people think REM sleep is for, your dreams are often influenced by things that happened during your day, for example when I was maybe 7 or 8 I was having food with my parents at a restaurant and we were next to a warm fire, I didn't notice it until I had a nightmare about a housefire that night... So REM sleep also acts as a warning to what could go wrong, and points out the dangers of things that you barely noticed, which is why its an evolutionary advantage to have frequent nightmares.

Another cool thing with sleep is that it is possible to use it to completely erase or change a memory on command, well it's not as easy as that, but what you have to do is remember the memory slightly and put a twist on it, and then repeat the process the next day and the day after that until you have reached your desired effect, because during your sleep you cannot only reinforce and organize memories but you can also overwrite old memories with new information, which is why sometimes you might have a fake memory that you were somewhere but theres hard evidence that you were not, this problem can also effect witnesses of crimes unfortunately. However this is used for good in people who have had a traumatic experience that they can make better by slowly overwriting the traumatic part of the memory with something nicer.

The brain is an interesting mass of noodles and I can't wait to see what amazing things we find out about it within the next 20 years... think AGI.
