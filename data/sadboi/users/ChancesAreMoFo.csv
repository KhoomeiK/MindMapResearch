SuicideWatch,f7ktefz,t1_f7kstmv,1573825325.0,"I hate others worrying about me, so I go through my days like everything is fine when, really, I'm at the end of my rope. 

I'm afraid to speak, even with people I've known for years. I am constantly filtering myself, always worried I'll say something stupid. It's exhausting."

TalkTherapy,er9d7k5,t1_er9bl57,1560621790.0,"Yeah, I understand. She may be trying to push you to become more comfortable with that. I shouldn't say ""push"", it's more like she wants to guide you out of your comfort zone. It takes time and she probably knew you weren't yet there, which is why she said she would read it if that was what you wanted."
