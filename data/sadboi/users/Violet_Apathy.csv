lgbt,fcpb56m,t3_eicu47,1577856825.0,Do try to keep some of your pretransition photos. Eventually it won't hurt and you can look back at yourself and see how much you've changed.

BPD,fc7f4fd,t3_eghte2,1577505551.0,"Are you in an environment that is infantilizing you? I feel like I'm fairly vulnerable to it happening when I'm in those kinds of environments. I find trying to enter more adult spaces, like a job, helps me ""grow up"" a bit."

BPD,far46we,t1_far3hwb,1576311998.0,I think about that a lot. Hopefully I'll never actually put my research about how to do it effectively to the test.

BPD,f8mdt3p,t3_e12gy9,1574630457.0,"I stopped debating it when I was sterilized. I'm far too fucked up and had a terrible childhood to put that on someone else. I don't even have pets because I barely even take care of myself, let alone another lifeform."

BPD,f7q39zb,t3_dxde57,1573958180.0,I often angrily call myself a coward for not having the courage to actually do it when I'm feeling suicidal. I don't think I want to die as much as I don't want to hurt any more.
BPD,f7aq2sm,t3_dv4yi3,1573536134.0,suicidal gestures and being manipulative are traits common to BPD. I hope you find better ways to get a sense of who cares for you other than faking your death.

lgbt,eu8ijjj,t1_eu8f8ik,1563557790.0,"*hugs* 
I felt the same way you did. Gender worms push their way out eventually. We can try to play scorched earth whack a mole with them by trying to deny it or accept them and make a beautiful garden."
lgbt,eu8eo5m,t1_eu8e4uk,1563555570.0,"Right before I figured out I was trans. I would take what gender are you tests obsessively. It would say that I was a woman and it felt really good so I kept on doing it. I rationalized it by saying to myself, ""since I'm a gay man, it makes sense that my brain is female since most women are attracted to men."" Now I'm definitely not a man but still super gay."

AskReddit,er6o8y7,t3_c0ocp5,1560552485.0,The end user's ability to understand the explanation lies with our ability to explain it. When I was doing technical support I would explain what I was doing and why and recap at the end of the call. Educating the end user or at least making the effort to keep them informed of what were doing is showing them that you respect them. It creates a good experience for the end user it makes them far more cooperative and it makes for an overall less stressful experience me as well as them. It's our responsibility to speak to the level that the end user is at rather than condescending to them.
