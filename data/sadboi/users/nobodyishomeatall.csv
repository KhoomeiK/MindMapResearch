GothStyle,fqebrqd,t1_fqcz4uz,1589304960.0,my ears are from elvencaravan on etsy I use spirit glue to get them to stay they go over half of the ear. These are the mini fangs from scarecrow they're more wearable every day it was easy for me to get the right fit you just have to not move it while molding
GothStyle,fqebbv6,t1_fqcpwad,1589304758.0,on etsy they're cheaper
GothStyle,fqcjrlh,t1_fqci76a,1589260050.0,Amazon its a fake corset with plastic boning but I have a real corset with steel boning underneath if you search leather corset or bustier it comes up I wanted real leather but I want to wait till I loose weight and real leather is around 80 to 100+ bucks rather than the 24 I spent for this
GothStyle,fqce5s2,t3_gi260u,1589256014.0,I really want my ears elfed & permanent lumineer fangs but because of lock down & how much it costs I make do with fx & custom fangs for now. Yes I wear them outside.

curlyhair,fqc029v,t1_fqbycp0,1589247346.0,yea idk why
curlyhair,fqb1ja9,t1_fqb0lem,1589228952.0,now that's a compliment thank you
curlyhair,fqb07k3,t3_gho2wi,1589228308.0,"I am wondering how long did it take you to get used to the curly hair routine & how much time it takes. My makeup usually takes 2 hours (this is not my normal make up made sure it was as basic and neutral as possible) I'm a goth so it normally takes me around 2 and half hours to get ready & one of the main reasons I straighten is because all I have to do is brush it for a second & leave. How do you fit your routine into your life and how did it take for you to get used to it. The main things that keep me from going natural is the time, breakage, hair loss (for some reason I get a lot of breakage & stuff when my hair is curly) & how it gets insanely tangled right away even if i wear a bonnet to sleep."
curlyhair,fqazokv,t1_fqalcvu,1589228050.0,D: its so hard not to how do you guys get used to the routine & fit in with your life & how long has it taken you to get used to it?
curlyhair,fqazkjf,t1_fqaq1ks,1589227995.0,wow I've never had anyone say I look like anyone before I will take that compliment & save it in my mind thank you.
curlyhair,fqaze35,t1_fqaxkgk,1589227906.0,"it's an oil that's meant for the whole body it has Rwtinyl, Sunflower seed oil, Flower oil, Lavender oil, rosemary leaf oil, soy bean oil & more its made in South Africa  its great for skin & hair it helps with scars stretch marks aging or dehydrated skin its a bit expensive at around 40 bucks for the size I've had but it's cheaper than buying a bunch of little bottles of diff oil I've used it for my hair and it works better for me personally that other oils that are marketed for hair."
FreeCompliments,fqaffh4,t3_ghefrd,1589218158.0,You're model material beautiful that person is crazy
curlyhair,fq9t3kv,t1_fq9spmz,1589206492.0,"When my hair is straightened I get no breakage, hair thinning or hair loss. & the only product I use in my hair after washing is bio oil. When my hair is natural i get a lot of breakage & hair loss which gives me anxiety which is one of the reasons I don't keep it like that often."
curlyhair,fq9svxa,t3_gho2wi,1589206364.0,"My routine was to wash it with the conditioner than came with my loreal black hair dye because my hair was freshly dyed, no shampoo, & then I put bio oil in my hair & let it air dry."
curlyhair,fq9so8q,t1_fq9scwu,1589206238.0,natural color is dark brown
curlyhair,fq9sn5d,t1_fq9scwu,1589206219.0,I dyed it black & in the curly photo it is freshly dyed
curlyhair,fq9sl0z,t3_gho2wi,1589206185.0,"I only put bio oil in my hair when wet & let it air dry. Since I don't usually keep my hair natural I don't have the right products. I shaved my head/ did the big chop years ago because my hair was bleach damage  & now when straightened it is hip length when natural it is boob length which is a whole foot of shrinkage 12 inches gone. When I straighten I only do it once a month cause my hair doesn't get oily & I don't sweat so I can get away with that so that's probably why I don't have that much heat damage. If you're wondering I'm mixed dominican/Haitian & Jamaican/African although yes I'm light skinned. I really don't know how you amazingly patient people keep their hair natural its so high maintenance with the refreshing the curls every day, & the cowashing. My hair gets so tangled curly & it gives me a lot of breakage even when I wear a bonnet. You guys are dedicated & amazing."
TrueOffMyChest,fp8p3at,t3_gbgtal,1588398486.0,"I live here & I agree, I'm so tired of it. I use reddit as an escape from the shit here not to see it everywhere I go."
TooAfraidToAsk,fmsctfl,t3_fwudye,1586352693.0,No thankfully my friends aren't dumbasss but my bfs parents who are at risk have not been taking it seriously and go out every day. I already knew they were odd and I had previously informed my bf I don't want them in my life. They only think about themselves and don't even care if their own family members and children suffer because of it. They are not allowed in my home ever. It's a bit of an awkward position to be in with future parents in law but my bf understand and has equal disdain.
UpliftingNews,fmsawcy,t1_fmr8b92,1586351389.0,I live in New York and a good amount of people are reporting to small news channels that they were discharged while they were still really sick and were forced to continue recovering at home. I mean they're still alive and they need beds so I guess it's kinda okay but idk...
GothStyle,fmeoct1,t1_fmeo9j3,1586009709.0,I want the knee high ones but idk how I feel about ruining my heels again. I have permanent scars from the Jadons and my Achilles are weak

YouShouldKnow,fmbft6h,t3_ftuo4p,1585925495.0,"Only if you paid for that. The flights where canceling/refunds aren't allowed are cheaper, same for hotels and other things it always says which type you are purchasing before you checkout there's an option to pay extra for refundable tickets usually."
SkincareAddiction,fm0q57r,t3_fsd8pv,1585663916.0,Question: should I stop using it completely? Even though its my bad for leaving it on so long I'm quite scared to use it ever again.
SkincareAddiction,fm0p9fu,t1_fm0p3mg,1585663379.0,"Will do, thank you, it's on my whole face unfortunately."

GothStyle,fkyp450,t1_fkyozux,1584653226.0,I had no choice I wasn't able to cancel an appointment I had today the doctor refused and if I canceled it would have costed me a good amount of money
AnimalCrossing,fkyk0dc,t1_fkyjdcp,1584650263.0,I already told my roomates & my bf that no one will be heading from me for a bit

Instagramreality,fim2eqs,t3_f8hwu1,1582516324.0,I really needed to see this been going to the gym for a while and barely see a difference in the scale and I forget that when you do things the healthy way weight loss is slow or sometimes doesn't even happen since the fat just gets replaced by muscle. I know that but yet its still very easy to just get frustrated and give up.
ac_newhorizons,fim0p6f,t1_fim0bus,1582515051.0,"Kiki (I know she wears a natural sweater but I usually try to change her clothes, Lucky (ofc), Tiffany (I like her fishnets), Muffy, & Cole. My sweet ones are marshal, flurry, Becky (not a common dreamy but she reminds me of my grandma), Gayle, & Chrissy. I'll probably change some around with the new game due to the new villagers I def want that galaxy bear."
ac_newhorizons,filzqaz,t1_filxjvu,1582514336.0,"I love symmetry I always buy things in 3s and make them equal distance from the center. I'm considering changing the rivers to be like this (â¡) rather than this --â¡-- still keeping the waterfalls in the middle I'm not sure, as simple as it looks this map took me forever so I'll probably redo it and compare when I have time. I'll definitely look into that village I'm sure I'll like it. Thank you."

GothStyle,fiervuf,t3_f75vju,1582381941.0,"You could always make a post about the different goth subcultures to help the baby bats find their style and educate them. It's also okay for elders to try new fashions as well that don't traditionally have a place in goth fashion, just because someone looks a certain way for one day doesn't mean they are new to the subculture. Just like the whole ""nugoth"" thing was popular 10 years ago, there is a e-girl crossover thing happening right now, but there has always been things trending outside the subculture that bleed into the community, this isn't new and that's just how it is in every community and subculture."
TheWayWeWere,fi4lx4f,t1_fi4lopu,1582143838.0,Okay I saw that there's like a fake corpse now so that answered my last question.
TheWayWeWere,fi4lopu,t3_f6cq3a,1582143701.0,Is that a real body? Were they required to hang people there or were there like gallows that they usually handed people on and then occasionally  they would hang someone there instead or like donate a corpse for decoration? Is there some kind of mannequin hanging there now? Many questions sorry.
Instagramreality,fi1asns,t3_f51og5,1582054045.0,I don't really get whats so weird about this. When people take pictures they smile even when they're sad or depressed but because it's a video its weird? Come on guys when you take a picture with friends or family you don't go sorry I can't smile in this picture I'm depressed no you just smile. Why would she want a video where she looks miserable?
TwoXChromosomes,fh3ozvy,t3_f11j01,1581271003.0,I get my birth control online and I don't have to see a gyno or a doctor at all to get refills and the refills are also automatic and with my insurance its completely free.

TwoXChromosomes,fguo1ww,t3_f0dfmt,1581125481.0,"This was never a surprise to me, I was r*ped by a man that was shorter and looked physically weaker than me and it made me realize that I would never be stronger than any man even when I go to the gym every other day and tried my best.
