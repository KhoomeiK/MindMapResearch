These types of statements piss me off so much. The rise of the nazi party was due to about 20 years of complicated social factors and political/cultural manipulation of the german population which is like 50% of the reason that makes it so scary and fucked up IMO. It's not like Hitler showed up one day and was like ""hey, lets kill all the non-aryans"" and everyone was like ""okay sweet!"" I have a book on the rise of nazi propaganda that I bought at the Holocaust Museum in DC if you want to borrow it.

I would say the early Linkin Park stuff has not aged very well (generally speaking), it's very much of its time and the quasi-nu metal-white guy-rapping in 2020 sounds dated and annoying.   


I would also say that the visual aesthetic of guys like Marilyn Manson / Slipknot / Rob Zombie / etc. has not aged well. I was recently watching an old music video for MM's ""This is the New Shit,"" and was like ""holy shittt this looks so dated and lame."" Kind of like emo/edgelord type shit. Lots of cheap leather jackets, eye liner, latex, and ""us vs. the jocks"" imagery. Not to mention that shock rock in general has kind of died out apart from more niche groups (like Scandinavian black metal stuff).  


On a controversial note, System of a Down has not aged very well either IMO. When Toxicity came out everyone in my ""skater bro"" (early 2000s.... ugh)  friend group got into it because it was an accessible numetal / alt metal album that wasn't too extreme but still had a bit of a rebellious edge to it.

Layne is a legendary and iconic vocalist who will remain regarded as one of the best rock singers in historh. With that said,  William is a more technically proficient vocalist. He does not miss notes or smoke crack / shoot up right before getting on stage so his delivery is awesome and consistent. This also translates to his contributions in the studio IMO.

He does not try to imitate Layne's drawly, gritty, howling delivery although he does sing in the same general style so his voice is more of an homage to layne's vocals rather than an attempt to replicate the unique personality and quirks of Layne's vocals like a cover artist would -- which to me is a key distinction and is what makes DuVall work so well with current AIC.

Also Jerry's songwriting changed during the intervening hiatus years to become a lot more heavy metal focused and the whole vibe of their new albums is fresh and feels like a progression rather than just trying to bottle the lightning from the early 90s. Jerry also was always the foundation for Layne's vocals to build off of so theres still those trademark harmonies and the familiar AIC vocal sound even without Layne.

Brian Eno (kind of like the ... lord of ambient music ... his album Ambient 1: Music For Airports is probably the all around best ambient album ever IMO and it came out in the late 1970s). Extremely chill, gentle, immersive sounds and dozens of different albums to choose from.  


Tim Hecker. Interesting because his music is very dark and utilizes a lot of noise and even industrial sounding elements. It's really heady and almost always reminds me of winter when I listen to it.   


Nine Inch Nails' album ""Ghosts"" is a collection of short mostly ambient songs. Trent Reznor's soundtracks for various films like Gone Girl are also really interesting and freaky for background listening. 

Hiroshi Yoshimura's ""Music for Nine Postcards"" is a piano based ambient album with lots of emotion and depth that many people consider one of the best ambient albums of all time.   


There is also an underground Russian artist called [Iguana Moonlight whose album ""Wild Palms""](https://iguanamoonlight.bandcamp.com/album/wild-palms) I absolutely love.

If you are using algorithms to analyze the ""quality"" of your lyrics for anything outside of novelty or a weird way of having fun with it, I think this is a time consuming, unartistic (by definition), and flawed way of approaching songwriting. Kind of like the crux of why some people dislike pop songwriting and lyrics that are designed in a sterile, highly contrived format.

Do you have any theories on why the older detective mentions toshios body was never found? Seems like it would have been easier if he just explained his body was found in the closet or something. 

And i think its really interesting how the ""in the grip of rage"" thing translates, because it could be construed in english to sort of go either way (a mothers rage trying to protect her son or a fathers rage murdering his family) and also Kayako was strangled which makes it kind of a dark double entendre. 

In the American remakes there is so much of the layered plots and interesting (albeit sometimes confusing) quirks that get messed up and over simplified. I think the original American remake just got the ghost/curse design more frightening but still true to the original with the higher budget (especially the final version of the stair walk where Kayako is crawling down the stairs in a bloody bag, like holy shit way to keep ratcheting that one up)."

Meanwhile in this film the house is a boring rundown house in PA with large open spaces (particularly the livingroom/kitchens) and poorly established layout, it has no feeling of claustrophobia. Just dumb and mostly unearned jump scares.

It is a weird, vague, area though because of the psychoactive effect that it has -- I mean, it does get you ""high"" afterall... which as far as side effects go is fine with me.   


I am a recovering alcoholic and have never had any trouble limiting or controlling my weed intake, I actually spent 3.5 years stone sober before getting into medical weed after consulting with my psychiatrist and therapist. I use (legit) hash oil carts which helps me carefully control the dosages and anticipate their effect. I don't worry about it too much like I do with traditional anxiolytics like xanax.

A couple of months ago I had to take a long tolerance break b/c of a potential drug test for a new job and felt no psychological or physical withdrawal symptoms even after using weed nearly every evening (usually just a few hits early-mid evening) for about 3 months.

People say the movie shouldve revealed her burning her kid at the Reyburn house,  but personally I dont think the movie ""earned"" that sort of heavy and thoughtful climax.  Also you could argue that she actually DID burn the kid and then everything see saw after leaving the burning house was a figment of her ghostly imagination.

It also had tall oak trees all around it that made the yard look shadowy in the middle of the day. Spooky. 

So there are def American homes / neighborhoods where that vibe could be replicated but a downtrodden shitty single family home in rural Pennsylvania is not one of them.

Why not use a traditional colonial style house in a secluded upscale neighborhood?  Theres like a million of those on the east coast."

This movie was not unwatchable ... it was just ... stupid.   


For one thing: It refuses to play by its own rules! Why do the ghosts take the Police Officer Woman at the end instead of her killing her child and then herself and the curse continuing in her own house / the original house until the next victim enters?  


The jump cutting between timelines and unnecessary amount of characters was a major problem with the original Ju-On but given that it was an international film from the late 90s, I gave it a pass for this. This remake missed the opportunity to iron out the unnecessary jumping around between timelines or at least portray it in a way that isn't confusing. I was SO confused for the first 75 minutes trying to figure out what had happened to the elderly dementia lady after the female officer called the ambulance.   


PS: What the fuck are they specifically investigating? The case makes no sense. Detective Goodman didn't ever even go into the house on 44 Reyburn? How the fuck did he even ""investigate"" it then?   


Sidenote: Did I mishear something or was there a weird throwaway line suggesting Goodman was having a gay relationship with his ex-partner? There's a weird line in the flashback right before the partner shoots himself where Goodman says something like, ""Whats wrong? Did your wife find out? I'm sorry this is all happening ...""   


There is also so much hamfisted symbolism in the movie -- like repeated numbers (the Police Station's address is ""999,"" the house is ""44"" Reyburn St.,, Police Lady calls Reyburn at 4:44 AM, etc. ... I think this may be a nod to traditional Japanese superstition regarding bad luck but it was showing up so much that I found it distracting and dumb.  Also water .... sinks, bathtubs, showers, rain, wet hands ... we get it .....

&#x200B;

Oh and the whole ""8 unrelated people have died in this house over the last 5 years"" line, or whatever they say -- are you fucking for real??? No one aside from the insane cop who blew half his face off caught onto something being amiss there?   


Good parts:  


The woman with dementia was the scariest character. That scene of her chopping up ""carrots"" ... yikes.   


Loved the ending ... it was predictable but I liked the payoff.   


The acting throughout this movie is actually quite good IMO, especially Detective Goodman and the elderly black man caring for his dementia wife.

Trying to ""cut back"" on drugs like cocaine, meth, heroin, alcohol, etc. generally does not work well for people. Deal with the physical and mental withdrawal for a couple of weeks and feel your body rejuvenate once your system clears of the toxic shit. Don't give yourself opportunities to become frustrated with the lack of ""high"" that you get while cutting back and just revert to using the same old doses you're used to.
