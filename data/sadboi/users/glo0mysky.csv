Also, short hair isn’t an option for me, I truly look so ugly with short hair that my dry, coarse mop is the better option. I also have a really bad hairline that’s more visible with short hair, but even if I didn’t, it looks much worse. My skin condition is called Seborrheic Dermatitis and the only thing doctors give you for that is steroid cream which isn’t good for long-term use (thins the skin).
