AdultSelfHarm,fmc1nbu,t1_fmaht4n,1585937222.0,Here to echo this üíú
FTMOver30,fjnvobx,t1_fjluqnf,1583515271.0,Came here to suggest this!
SelfHarmScars,fjfgwfj,t1_fjexsyi,1583291559.0,It softened and lightened some of my scars.
ftm,fiy7j1l,t1_fiy7a51,1582834057.0,"Yeah I'm wondering since the office is in PA the law (if it exists) would apply. 

And yeha I'm in the beginning stages of considering top surgery and the biggest hurdle is exactly this. I dont even see a doctor regularly because the health care system in this country is so unpredictable. 

Good luck and sending you good vibes."
BPDlovedones,fiy76ey,t3_fahxnv,1582833863.0,I'm also genuinely curious about this
ftm,fiy6mj2,t3_faft7v,1582833549.0,"My sister has had 2 back surgeries in PA and still lives in PA. She obviously owed money after the surgery but she said that as long as she makes some kind of payment monthly that it's illegal in Pennsylvania for them to take her to collections? I think she's only paying like $25 a month because she cant afford more either. Idk if it's a true state law or if it just happens to be a hospital policy, but I thought it'd be worth sharing... idk.

But congrats on surgery! I hope everything works out for you. My wife has had her fair share of medical bills too and so many offices are terrible to work with..."
FTMOver30,fi4dp24,t3_f6f1nh,1582139100.0,I currently use trans tape... it's a nice alternative to binding for me... https://instagram.com/trans_tape?igshid=bz37dbody8hb
BPDlovedones,fi0c3yk,t1_fhzt2ub,1582033182.0,I relate to this explanation the most I think. Amen.
selfharm,fhzfir1,t3_f5jhli,1581998179.0,"I feel ya. I'm in the same boat right now. I think I'm almost to 8 years but shits just been stressful. Not wanting to disappoint my wife is the only thing stopping me. 

Stay strong and sending you good vibes to help get you through this."
BipolarSOs,fbxuedq,t3_eetse0,1577200774.0,"I've had super similar experiences with my wife. The ""cant she or wont she"" question is particularly difficult for me. 

Everything you said resonated with me."
SelfHarmScars,f5zn5be,t3_dptpx4,1572581098.0,Chances are it will. I have scars on my hands that faded a lot. Since our hands take a lot of wear and tear daily the skin gets replaced faster or whatever. It's why hand tattoos fade faster than on other parts of your body.
BipolarSOs,f5o856z,t1_f5o58uh,1572312073.0,This is really amazing advice
BipolarSOs,f4u4mia,t3_dlnw7r,1571799000.0,I hope you find peace. I font have any advice or anything but sending you healing vibes to hopefully happier times. ‚ù§
depression,f4u3opz,t1_f4tol8p,1571798331.0,I had memory loss before being on any medication... but I have heard that they make it worse.
depression,f4u3k55,t1_f4tor4k,1571798240.0,"I came here to say this! I dont remember so much of my childhood. It's weird to me. But like everyone else here said, when I mentioned it to a therapist yesss ago, it was pretty much just brushed aside..."
BipolarSOs,f21vczn,t3_dbcp5r,1569877265.0,I'm so sorry you're going through this. Hang in there.
AdultSelfHarm,f0vodg2,t3_d6r5xt,1568987673.0,I havent self harmed for like 7 years or so. And during that time I will say the thoughts did disappear for a little while. But I have to be honest and admit that right now I have a lot going on my life (more than normal) and the urges come back on occasion but they are a lot easier to deal with. Therapy helped me when I was trying to stop and I think its given me a good base to fight urges now.
selfharm,ezvjj4z,t3_d29bsw,1568180762.0,This is me right now
BipolarSOs,ezn0uzb,t3_d0pbgy,1567999425.0,I need to learn how to do this more. Good for you! Enjoy your time!
BipolarSOs,ez8c36c,t3_d09ssy,1567739304.0,Vent away! I know I'm not tired of you. Don't feel guilty for venting. Your vent actually brought me comfort in knowing I'm not the only one who doesn't want to be the responsible one anymore.
BipolarSOs,eyy72jy,t3_czfwld,1567573720.0,Sending you good vibes your way! I hope you get your husband back soon. This resonated with me because I also want my wife back. Best of luck ‚ù§
BipolarSOs,eydap0o,t1_eydaamr,1567014862.0,Yeah I dont really have any good advice but I did want to let you know you arent alone in this
BipolarSOs,eyd8nf3,t3_cwhxl1,1567013535.0,I have experienced this before in my SO. Sometimes she does reckless things during any swing.
SelfHarmScars,eybzm0y,t1_eybz87d,1566994337.0,Haha I know. It's so weird but my wife and I both normally get irritation from bandaids... unless they are kid's ones haha
SelfHarmScars,eyazcmg,t3_cqxivo,1566972792.0,I hope I'm not making a fool of myself. But I always related to those lines of that song. Thought I was the only one
SelfHarmScars,eyaywe4,t3_cr1yih,1566972530.0,"So this is super weird, but kids bandaids dont give me the rash/irritation like the ""adult"" normal ones do. I also found splurging for the Bandaid brand ones is worth it."
selfharm,ey9jfvu,t3_cw8rnp,1566944769.0,"Honestly, anyone that I've been with that didnt know I was self harming didnt bring it up. It's not like they weren't noticable at the time either."
AdultSelfHarm,exs6e27,t1_exr4rgr,1566533746.0,I had a therapist give me a rock and I carried it with me for years. It does seriously help ground you.
BipolarSOs,ex1msu7,t1_ex0p0y1,1565950229.0,"Yeah. Actually heres the link to the site https://genomind.com/

My friend had it done and swears by the results. She found that SSRIs weren't effective for her, hence why her depression wasnt improving. I'm looking into having someone sign off on it now for my wife. 

And I'm not sure if youre in the US, but usually insurance wont cover it. However! They usually work with you to cut the cost as much as possible. They have a ton of grants they can give out so it costs a few hundred. Like someone said, it isnt nothing but its cheaper than their full price. 

For the rest of your post: dont be terrified. I've been with my wife for 7 years and married for almost 2. She was only diagnosed in the last few years. I think this sub represents a lot of people's bad days. I know that I'm usually only lurking when I feel like I need support. Some days will be really hard. But honestly, there are so many reasons to still have hope. 

Take care <3"
BipolarSOs,ewz11ne,t3_cqqodl,1565889695.0,Thank you for sharing this. I wish you all the best. This has helped me feel a little less alone.
AdultSelfHarm,ew2vr7p,t3_cmfnbj,1565057096.0,Congrats! And I am happy to hear you found something to help you cope! I'm here if you need anything.
BipolarSOs,evfp3br,t1_evfnmbe,1564499123.0,"That's a good option. I hadn't thought of that. Thank you. Ultimately, I believe psychiatrist should be the one prescribing these meds but a family doctor short term while she looks is a great cover idea. Thank you, again!"
BipolarSOs,evf6ixa,t1_evf6bhk,1564489796.0,"She has been trying and communicate this for months with them now. And I agree jiving with your medical team is important. That's why she had so much success in our last city. She isn't going to quit until she finds a new one, as she understands she needs the refills and to continue attempting to work with the doctors."
BipolarSOs,evf68zq,t1_evf5jbh,1564489604.0,"I am definitely noticing the shortage for sure. And some practitioners are turning her away because she's on a sedative for her anxiety - which confused me so much. 

We're currently a few miles south of Pittsburgh. Idk where you've had success, but if you're in or around Pittsburgh, I'd love any and all advice! Thank you!"
BipolarSOs,evf417v,t3_cjpjeh,1564487946.0,Keep it up! Being the caregiver is often so overlooked and under valued. Stay strong!
BipolarSOs,evf3xrq,t1_evezwse,1564487874.0,"Yeah, luckily she's still expressing the need to see one. And I've kind of already laid the groundwork of you have to continue to take your meds and see your doctors regularly. But thank you for reading and responding. And I'm definitely wary of it as well! Thank you!"
SelfHarmScars,eve18s7,t1_eve0lr7,1564452785.0,Of course. Hope it works out for you !
SelfHarmScars,eve0gej,t1_evdzx9l,1564452183.0,"Oh, I 100% understand. It's the initial anxiety that can be the hardest step. I've started to just go for it. And I think when I appear unphased and unbothered by them, people tend to not think they're a big deal either."
selfharm,ev0alue,t3_chzvja,1564134811.0,I used to fantasize about breaking my left forearm.
BipolarSOs,ev0aevj,t3_chxilq,1564134712.0,"I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate you sharing this. It resonates with me .

Take care"
SelfHarmScars,euz1m8m,t1_eutn5w7,1564111804.0,Came here to also say bio oil!
SelfHarmScars,euz1gpm,t3_cgnu4n,1564111739.0,"Honestly, my experience is that the scars are way more noticeable to you than others. No one ever really asked me but like as I got closer with people I had mentioned I had scars and what they were from. Everyone I encountered was super nice and anyone that wasnt, I decided they weren't a good fit for me as someone to date or even as a friend. 

Good luck and your adventures and take care ‚ù§"
StopSelfHarm,erzf9op,t3_c50ccv,1561434023.0,"It varies depending on who is asking. Most of my visible scars are on the outside of my upper arm. I either reply with blaming sports (I was a goalkeeper for soccer and played other sports), or if I suspect they know what they are. I flat out just say ""I used to hate myself"". That usually ends the conversation."
AdultSelfHarm,ersjpx8,t1_ersic09,1561216080.0,Will do! Thanks for the warm welcome ‚ù§
AdultSelfHarm,ershnja,t1_ershjmy,1561214335.0,I'm glad to be in the company of y'all. A lot less islotating for me.
