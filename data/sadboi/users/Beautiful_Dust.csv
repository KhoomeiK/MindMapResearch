I get it being creepy when they follow up by talking dirty...that IS creepy. 
Before all this, if someone messed up and said something to ya, you'd tell your friends about it and have a good laugh. Now, it gets blasted all over the internet. I guess it is what it is. When I get fucked up messages, I just dont talk to them, but I dont put them on blast. The only one I ever put on blast, was an ex boyfriend, only after he had threatened to kill my horse, and a week later my horse was poisoned and killed ( no one saw him, so cops could do nothing) and after that he threatened to kill me and my daughter....police report was filed and I blasted him.

todayilearned,fmggm03,t1_fmfgoff,1586048594.0,"I love spiders. I was standing outside a business yesterday, waiting as they were only letting a few people in at a time. A baby black ordinary little spider dropped down on my arm, so I played with it, and let it run over my hands for about 10 minutes, until it was my turn to go in. Then I just let her run from my hand onto the wall and let her go. She was sweet and friendly and it kept me from being bored waiting."

WhereAreAllTheGoodMen,flz4qer,t1_fgerdoa,1585615480.0,How intimate and special can it be if shes selling it
WhereAreAllTheGoodMen,flz49ch,t3_f3xt3s,1585615181.0,That's abuse. I hope he got away from her. That kind of behavior is inexcusable.

Saying it's just her job is a cop out. You cant be committed to someone if you're still out there giving it up to other people."
