AnxietyDepression,fmbmp1o,t3_ftxip9,1585929356.0,"perhaps try to actively think about the things you've done right! so maybe things that have made you feel good in that moment, be it remembering to thank another person or helping someone across the street. having said that, i'm here to listen if you just want to talk about it"
SuicideWatch,f5f1p0x,t3_dnqv9p,1572177316.0,I hope you're still here.

lonely,f51hjl9,t3_dmfy3b,1571941047.0,Happy birthday. May all your wishes come true!
lonely,f51gy26,t3_dmbb28,1571940902.0,Same. Somehow it's just tough to find people to talk to or get hugs from. Could you give me a hug??
DecidingToBeBetter,f51e6va,t3_dmaguq,1571940166.0,Thank you for hope. I hope you stay well.

SuicideWatch,f18gkh9,t3_d874gw,1569257456.0,"Hang in there for one more day. It helps thinking in terms of day, or even another hour. 

I feel when people say stuff like ""u have been there and u can continue hanging on"" etc it's more of how you still possess the same strength to continue rather than because you are still here you can still be here (idk if what I'm saying makes much sense). Praise yourself for the effort that comes from you!! to continue."

KDRAMA,f0cbuuk,t3_czl5dm,1568538372.0,Wondering what's her identity but not sure why Minister Min would want Sahee to marry Dowon if he's the eldest son of the dethroned king (why was the king dethroned anyway)
KDRAMA,eyk0m6j,t1_ey3nnv9,1567133388.0,Maybe they were each other's real first love and that's kinda unforgettable I guess but... kdrama logic
KDRAMA,eyk0ab9,t1_exs641a,1567133129.0,It's kinda creepy but I guess they were just physically really attracted to each other.
KDRAMA,eyk02q7,t3_ctvyo0,1567132962.0,Spoilers but one part I really don't get is how she could deal with her cousin stealing 3 MILLION WON so easily ðŸ˜§
KDRAMA,eyjzyyo,t1_ey0148r,1567132878.0,"They mentioned that she was really afraid then. She was afraid she'll bring harm to him (re: the insensitive classmate). Can't really remember but I think she was also afraid he will leave her eventually (esp with the whole Jeju Island story that Gulmi likes to blame on her). 

She got involved w his best friend much later on (a few years later, actually), because he came to find her multiple times?????"
