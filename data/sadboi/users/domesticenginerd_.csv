I grabbed 2-3 squares of Trader Joe's dark chocolate. Normally I like it. Yesterday, it was not satisfying. I realized it wasn't worth the 230 calories. I almost spit it out. I am glad that I recognized that.  When I eat something like chocolate, I want to eat because I want to savor it.

I am glad that when it didn't satisfy me, I paused and stopped from eating further. Sometimes, when stressed and I eat something that doesn't satisfy me, I will eat more."

How can you tell that they’re making an effort?

I guess I ask for a couple reasons.

For one, I’ve had some highly spectrum narcissistic people in my life, so it caused me to develop some habits I’ve worked to overcome. (I want the healthiest relationships possible and from my perspective that starts with understanding the world around me and working on myself.)  I continue to try to overcome things as I identify them as an obstacle (granted, usually it's pointed out by someone else). All the same, I wonder occasionally if I am narcissistic unbeknownst to myself.

Another reason I ask is because I’ve recently encountered some people who I think are high on the narcissistic spectrum. I think you kind of answered my question.

One, for instance, told me last week they had overcome the areas we had identified the previous day. I shared that this needed to be shown over time and we couldn’t say based on 1 interaction if there was a change. Within that same discussion and then each subsequent one, they showed that this is not lasting and then they started continuing to deny and blame.

Another, I am not as certain. They do some of these behaviors. They have difficulty receiving correction and deeply ""need"" admiration. I’ve also seen them deny, blame shift, etc, but I also care deeply about the person so I see their heart. I can see their woundedness and I am trying to make a safe space for them. For instance, acknowledging their pain when they express it (even if sometimes it’s also littered with blaming) and trying to encourage them to continue to share their feelings and be vulnerable. My hope is that they are not, or if they are, it can be overcome."
psychology,fonv446,t1_fonohug,1587927055.0,"Hey there! How does one distinguish between the two?

I am so happy that your wife's words were what you needed. And I am happy to hear that you have found new life. I am especially encouraged by what you said about embracing being the ""spiritual priest of \[your\] family.""

I had a situation with which I was wrestling. I am pretty self-reflective so I try to think about what I can do better.

This chart is helpful in multiple ways for me. First, it helps me identify ways to improve. Second (and more encouraging for me), I can see ways that I already do well.

I told the person: “I would like to make my own decision.” I also stated my desire of “I’d like to be spoken to charitably (ie kindly).” I found some ways I could say this better, but I also believe I said something along the lines of, “I’d like to table this discussion because I am at work and have a difficult time pausing. I’d like to be able to focus on work right now.”

Even though there are ways I can continue say things better, I am happy to see the ways that I am effectively communicating. I am also happy that I’ve started identifying those improvement areas (identifying the gap and identifying the solutions are a great start!)"

It reminds me of this article that I saw last month (also included excerpt below):  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-freedom-change/201908/when-and-how-apologize-attachment-theory-perspective](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-freedom-change/201908/when-and-how-apologize-attachment-theory-perspective) 

It's helped me as I continue to try to refine and improve how I take responsibility and give effective apologies. It also helps me build empathy in understanding when others fall short (or even the inter-workings of why I fall short when I do).

&#x200B;

 

>Schumann (2014) suggests that effective apologies are likely to contain the following eight elements ([available online here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/0265407517746517)):  
>  
>Expressing remorse.  
>  
>Accepting responsibility.  
>  
>Attempting to repair the damage.  
>  
>Offering an explanation that does not deflect responsibility.  
>  
>Promising to behave better in the future.  
>  
>Acknowledging the harm that was done.  
>  
>Admitting wrongdoing.  
>  
>Asking for forgiveness.  
>  
>  
>  
>Schumann and Orehek’s research indicated that securely attached people tend to engage in more comprehensive apologies, meaning that they are more likely to use a greater number of the eight strategies listed above. Research by Ashy, Mercurio, and Malley-Morrison (2010) indicates that secure attachment also was one of the best predictors of positive attitudes toward forgiveness. Securely attached people are more open to forgiving relative to those with insecure attachment styles. It follows that those with secure attachment styles should expect positive things to come from apologizing and to engage in this behavior more frequently.  
>  
>But about 45 percent of the population has one of the three insecure attachment styles. Thus, even if you are secure yourself, you should read this material so that you can understand how insecurely attached people you interact with think about and process apologies. "

>Rather than seeing [co-dependency](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/codependency) as a disease state psychopathology, requiring years of in-depth treatment, we can see it as a learning deficit. We can reframe it as a normal stage of development, which is not a problem unless we get stuck there. Co-dependence is an inevitable and natural part of every relationship. Some people call it love, infatuation, or devotion. There is an [unconscious](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/unconscious) agreement in a co-dependent relationship that you’re not going to do anything to ruffle their feathers and they’re not going to do anything to ruffle ours. There’s an implicit agreement that we’re going to let each other merge.  
>  
>In every relationship, there is a stage where we lose ourselves in the other person, which is wonderful. It’s only a problem if we lose ourselves and don’t get ourselves back again. We keep the “Do not Disturb” agreement under wraps as part of the early developmental stage, until it doesn’t work for us anymore. When we recognize the toll that it’s taking on us is just too dear, we desire to progress to the next stage of differentiation."
