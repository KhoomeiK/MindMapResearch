We weren't sufficiently loved, cared for, or listened to  as children, so as adults we seek the love we never got at any cost, seeking to please other people in the hopes that they will stay with us. We're afraid to speak up and make decisions for ourselves, fearing that the people we love will find us too needy or emotional and leave us. But if you find the right people, who are emotionally mature and care about you, they won't abandon you for your needs and wants, in fact they'll be happy to support you.
