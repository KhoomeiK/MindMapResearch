It's hard to do anything but take life a day at a time, and when we're doing that, it's so easy to say we'll do better tomorrow. Today's what, Wednesday? And I've said that every day this week, including just now when I ordered lunch. I have a job that's remote workable and a partner, so they keep me on schedule mostly and stop me staying in bed all day, but also sometimes my partner has a bad day and wants nice things (which happened last night) and once I see a chink in the armor I go for it til I convince him to get nice things.

FoodAddiction,fqdgjd6,t3_ghyvdu,1589289177.0,"100% get you. I actually get moody and angry on 'good' days because I'm annoyed that I can't 'fully enjoy that day', because full enjoyment inherently means junk food. Even when I'm in positive form about eating well, it still requires so much more effort to be that 'good' person that I often slip, as I suffer from anxiety and depression. It really, really sucks. I can eat huge portions too. The idea of just having to eat mostly food I'm not that keen on for the rest of my life is pretty depressing. People laugh off food addictions and say if smokers can give up bad habits so can you.... the difference being, you HAVE to eat food so you're faced with the choices several times a day every day. It's like giving a smoker fake cigarettes to smoke throughout the day, while also offering the option everytime they open the pack, to smoke a real one. It's not easy!"

My experience is that he required a LOT more attention than a foreskinned guy because his sensitivity is so low. I've also rarely, if ever, encountered an unclean penis. If we can clean the folds of our outer vajayjays, guys can clean the tips of their penises. You are not even remotely a freak, you are a natural, normal guy as nature intended.

And I spent it sitting beneath a life size statue of JC himself nailed to an 8 foot cross. I barely understood who he was, let alone why that was done to him.

Needless to say, I remained an atheist my whole life."
atheism,fk2zvyw,t1_fk20e9k,1583813407.0,"Let's take these one at a time. 

First, Atheism is not a belief, it is an absence of beliefs. A-theism. Without theism. 


Second, vegans, prolifers etc absolutely do need to shut the fuck up and let people live their lives. We'll, whatever about vegans, they're at least doing good with their choices, but you still wouldn't have one jump into a biology class and go 'and that's why we should only eat plants, folks!' biology is not the place for such opinions. However Pro lifers, and I say this as someone in a country where we literally just got abortion legalized a year ago, don't 'allow children to get murdered'. They either let people have their right to choose, or they interfere in the free, constitutional rights of women as voted on by their society. Have the opinion and defend it, but do not get on a soapbox in a context where it has no place, such as outside an abortion clinic.


Third, and following on from second, religion has no place in a science classroom. I don't care what your beliefs are. Science is about things that can be tested and evaluated and measured to the best of our understanding. Do we have it all right? Fuck no, but the core of science is that we at least look for proof and test theories rigorously in order to make sense of the objective world around us. Religion has no place in it. And a science classroom is no more appropriate for his religious beliefs than outside an abortion clinic is for a pro lifers beliefs.


Fourth, police officers don't have beliefs. They have a system of legislation to abide by for better or worse, which they use to gauge appropriate behaviour and fuck knows justice is skewed at the best of times in a lot of places.

. 
You're mixing personal belief with firmly established  systems of measurement. I could say I believe in the flying spaghetti monster, that is a belief. I can believe it with every fiber of my being, and it will never be okay for me to present it in a science classroom as fact."

There are secular schools on the rise, but it's only TWO OR THREE YEARS since being a member of the catholic church WAS A MANDATORY REQUIREMENT to attend those schools, which make up 90 PERCENT of available schools. And as much of Ireland is rural, a lot of parents would have no choice but to send their kids to religious schools. Absolutely buttfucking insane. And disgusting. Can you tell it makes me mad? :-P"

But obviously I always regret it in the long run, because my mindset flips back. I have serious mood swings. Its a big issue for my depression/anxiety as I truly become apathetic sometimes. Even about the wedding - I'm like, ugh it's so much effort, lets just pop down the registry office.

I might be wary, but will give them the benefit of the doubt. I grew up in a town with a festival which means every year the place is inundated with travellers. Caravans used be parked all over any open space in my estate, until the council started putting huge concrete blocks (which killed the grass) to stop them and other barricades along the main road for the same reason. I've never, in my entire life, had a good interaction with a traveller. My estate had a couple of families of settled travellers, and one of the kids of one threw a knife at someone when I was a kid. It wasn't even really a dodgy estate. Council, but not dodgy, except for that. I would take no issue with the 20% who work and are sound people, but the 80% are scumbags. They don't work but want the benefits of a social welfare system they don't contribute to? Nah. I don't care if you're a traveller or not, if you have never, and will never, contribute taxes to the system, you shouldn't be benefitting from what that system offers its tax paying people. Your post has honestly made me dislike the 80% even more, because as you say, if even someone OF that community has nothing to do with that 80% and is embarrassed by their behaviour, that speaks volumes. I'm sorry your beautiful heritage has turned to that, in modern times, genuinely. I love old traveller wagons too, there's one in my town that's been there since I was a little and I love looking at it. Thanks for sharing your experience and views, and I will very much keep in mind that there are a good 20% of you out there next time I meet one, in the hopes that they will be one of the 20%."
