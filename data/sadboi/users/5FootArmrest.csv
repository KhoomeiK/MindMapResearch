AskWomen,fploz72,t3_gdokt5,1588716724.0,"First meds changed my life for the worst. They were not all bad at first, but they didn't really help overall. My mood did chill down a bit, but I had so many significant, negative side effects ( completely no energy, insomnia, suicidal thoughts, psychomotor retardation, so on). My psychiatrist always played it off as ""oh it's just stress."" Then I started engaging in new behaviors I vowed to never do, and I quit my meds cold turkey (not the best idea but yeah). Most of the side effects are gone now, so I know it wasn't just ""stress.""

But even so, I've not given up hope on meds--I mean I only tried 1 type--and I just started a new type recently, with a new psychiatrist. It's literally just been a few days, so I can't comment if they are helping me just yet, but I guess this experience has given me a better idea of how I am regularly/off-meds (because it was difficult to tell if my symptoms were just ME or the meds), so I have more of an idea of how I actually feel again.

Ever since I can remember (\~5 yrs old) I had told her that I didn't want to go and that I didn't believe in a god, and she forced me to go every time (I'll excuse that since I was young and a babysitter may not have been an option). Eventually she got busy with work and we moved around a bit, and she stopped going as frequently. When I got older/pre-teen, she still tried to force me to go when she would go, and I told her that I would cause a scene and act like I was possessed by the devil if she forced me to go again, and then she stopped forcing me to go :D. I don't know if she believed me or if she just gave up (I was telling the truth though).

Anyway, I don't believe in any religion and never have. I felt forced to believe in a god, and I felt so, so much guilt over it because of her. I felt like I was fucked up, why didn't I believe? What was wrong with me? A few times, I tried to pray and tried to participate in church so she would like me/give me some slack/maybe religion was real, but in the end, it was all fake for me.

Of course there are bad communities, but when you find a good community that supports you, understands what you’re going through, and doesn’t encourage bad behavior (intentionally), it can be a rewarding experience. 

A lot of parents/people want all ED communities to be wiped from the internet. I understand some sites can encourage young people to “want” an ED, but so does so many things (TV, celebrities, models, clothes, music). And in terms of them “learning how to get an ED” (or so they say), anyone who gets a legitimate ED after being on an ED community likely already had the problem to begin with. And banning their support group won’t suddenly make the problem go away, and it will make it worse.

EDAnonymous,f529j0p,t3_dmi03w,1571948439.0,"I used online dating apps. I used okCupid, Tinder, Bumble, and Plenty of Fish. Honestly all the sites are full of absolute trash people, but there are some good people. It can be very exhausting filtering out all the trash, some people can send angry messages if you don't respond quickly or at all (literally I wouldn't respond for 10 minutes and some people got mad lmao). Ton of people looking for hookups, even if you explicitly state that you're not interested in that. But I met my current bf on okCupid, so it wasn't a completely bad experience (we've been together 2.5 yrs and live together now). It's worth a shot, you don't have to meet up with anyone if you don't want to : )

In terms of telling them about your ED, I don't really have experience in this :\\ I had disordered habits before meeting my bf, but I became aware that I have an ED during the beginning of our relationship and it was a really rough first year. I only briefly mentioned to my bf about my ED last week, and he hasn't said anything about it and I'm too scared to bring it up again, so I'm not sure what he thinks. Now I'm basically paranoid whenever we eat or talk about food, because I don't know if he forgot I told him about it, or if he's looking at how much I'm eating, or whatever the fuck he's thinking. If I could do it differently, I think I should've told him in the beginning/when I found out I had a problem, definitely before we moved in together lol. Some people don't want to date people with mental health issues. I highly doubt that I could emotionally deal with a partner who has severe mental health issues, especially if they have an ED."

But people always put x diet above others, or say you absolutely can't eat x y z to lose weight, but in reality it's just basic math. I could eat cookies every day and still lose weight."

EDAnonymous,f4xw5hp,t3_dm5xpj,1571869514.0,"The ""ED voice"" is just intrusive thoughts. It doesn't need to sound like someone else talking. Of course, it's different for everyone, but it's not like an auditory hallucination unless someone has those issues in general (like schizophrenia).

For me, most of the time it's the normal ED thoughts that I'm sure you have--the ones about being fat, needing to lose weight, don't eat x y z, always thinking about food, etc. But I also have (rare) moments where my ED voice is much louder and I get physical symptoms. Dozens of thoughts about my body/weight/food are racing *constantly* in my head within seconds, I get a headache, my heart hurts, I want to die, want to cry/do cry. But from what I understand, this could also be anxiety/ADD/OCD/etc (I am undiagnosed). The last time it happened like that was about 2 months ago, and it's not common like the normal ED thoughts I have on a constant basis. But like I said, I'm not sure if that's some other disorder working together with my ED. ((If anyone who sees this has any info on this kind of physical reaction, please let me know!!))

Maybe another reason why people use the term ""ED voice"" is because they can feel like different people/personalities when they have intrusive thoughts (but not like DID..) I feel like I have \~4 different voices (normal, restrictive/ED, binge voice, another voice more closely related to depression/BPD). They are all me, but in my ""normal"" (ish) state right now, it's like they are different me's, if that makes sense. I am fully aware that I act irrationally or that I could lose weight eating 1200 cals a day, but my thoughts ""won't let me."" This is why some people say ""ana/mia made me do it.""

Hope this helped :D"

EDAnonymous,f4whued,t3_dlvs6n,1571856197.0,"Probably the most triggering for me is the competitiveness and also numbers.

My trigger number is >!120!< lbs. If I get higher than that, I'm bound to get back into an OW bmi. I normally maintain between >!115 and 117!< now, so it's not the best and still pretty close to that trigger number, but it's enough to typically not go over that trigger number, even with water/food weight fluctuations. If I get close to that number, I tend to heavily restrict, fast, and c/s until I return to the normal weight.

But I also have a competitive factor, that I only realized/accepted recently. Basically, I always need to be ""perfect"" or better than/more successful than my sister at every aspect of life. It is absolutely horrible, especially because there's really no realistic competition as I am (as terrible as it sounds) more successful than her at everything and I don't even need to try hard :( There's more factors to my competitiveness with others besides my sister too, but I don't get as triggered from other people.

Also I told my bf that I have an ED last week, so I feel the need to prove it even more now lol."

EDAnonymous,f4w3zbd,t3_dluz4d,1571851521.0,"Yesterday, I spent 40 minutes on hold to try and get an appt with a psychiatrist (not currently seeing one or a therapist). I just ended up hanging up and losing motivation. Like they always try to say they want people to get help for their mental health, but how do you do that when you have to spend 40+ minutes on hold???? They don't let us schedule appointments online, even if we've been to the department before. And even if you want recurring appointments, you usually have to wait 6+ weeks before you get your next appointment. And if you want more frequent appointments than that, you have to find an out-of-network provider and pay their rate out-of-pocket. It's frustrating and why I stopped going in the first place. Talking about my issues every 6-8 weeks is not frequent enough to provide adequate help."

He thought it was a fan, and when I told him it was a heater, he was shocked lol. Then I showed him my blanket too and he was more shocked XD. I guess I'm the only cold one in the office."
