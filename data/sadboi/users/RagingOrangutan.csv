The challenge of flying is in multitasking; there's lots to monitor, your airspeed, other traffic, your altitude, your navigation, and so forth.

Airplanes can be controlled entirely by computers these days, including landing - and most of the time you're in a commercial airliner, it's probably being controlled by the autopilot.

The truth is, the US government has been bad about this kind of thing through both parties. We can, and should, be particularly mad at Trump and Republicans for their initial downplaying of the coronavirus in February/March; all that ""flatten the curve to buy us time"" could've happened earlier. But the Democrats have not been shining examples of competence and responsibility here either, because they didn't do everything they could when they were in power to prepare for this in the years leading up to it. They have just been doing more than Republicans since it became obvious that a pandemic would be happening, and that we would need to respond to it."
pics,fq6r2o9,t1_fq6pqwy,1589136709.0,"1. Our lack of preparedness for pandemics (and unlikely-but-severe events generally) has been a problem for decades, I never said Trump was solely responsible, and if you can quote me the part where I did that, I'll eat my hat. ""preventable with better government preparation"" is what I said, and that statement is meant to be interpreted comprehensively and is not pointed at any particular politician - the government has been fucking this up for a long time now. However, it's also the case that Trump has made an already bad situation worse, by initially downplaying the virus and not beginning emergency preparations sooner (we could've ramped up testing, PPE, and ventilator manufacturing in January), and generally having a chaotic and disorganized response.

2. Administrations do tons of things. They also spent time working on energy policy, but no one is saying ""they should've stopped working on energy policy and focused on PPE."" The link here is equally weak, so it really makes no sense to talk about what they did for radiation preparedness - it's unrelated. The problem was with PPE, let's just talk about PPE."

Also, travel restrictions didn't go into effect until Feb 2, though they were announced Jan 31.

And finally: travel restrictions without taking other measures like starting to ramp up manufacturing of PPE and testing equipment before supply chains are disrupted was some serious incompetence. If they believed it was a big problem, the response should have been comprehensive, not just ""lol no more chinese"" and patting yourself on the back for it."
pics,fq6oqac,t1_fq6ipf8,1589135604.0,"1. Without a doubt, it was irresponsible for Obama to not replenish the supply of PPE after it was depleted.

2. I don't understand the link being made between radiation equipment and PPE. It's not like you need to choose one over the other. The radiation stuff seems also worth doing, but unrelated.
