No code, no approval, and that was specifically *because* knock-off ""certifications"" didn't have them. You also needed personal letters from your previous supervisors verifying your teaching experience.  

The fact that you mentioned the exact requirements teachers at Dada *do* need, though, leads me to believe you're just trolling. But, if you're not, let me disillusion you from something: I hate to break it to you, but domestic labor *is* labor. Just devalued and subsequently unpaid and pigeonholed to traditionally feminine (and thus ""female"" by extension, in the capitalist mindset) gender roles to perpetuate women's lower class status to men. Unfortunately, some leave those societal roles unexamined and instead allow them to fester and devolve into a misogyny not unlike those permeating from your comments. If that's the case, you definitely deserve this pay cut. I wouldn't dare let my children call your unintelligent ass ""teacher"" 😂😂"
DaDaABC,fovlcoq,t1_fou9vz3,1588103269.0,"I think all of you are missing a really big piece a lot of veteran teachers within Chinese online ESL platforms have experienced. Around October 2018, the Chinese government passed a law mandating that every teacher hired by online ESL platforms must have a bachelor's; a license to teach, a TESOL certificate, or equivalent; a clean background check and at least 2 years of experience teaching children. Prior to this, only a Bachelor's and experience teaching children was absolutely necessary (I know, because I was hired with only a Bachelor's and 2 years of experience). When this law passed, Dada required all teachers to get at least TESOL certified within 2 months or be fired. I remember a lot of teachers thought they were bluffing. They were not. As a result, many teachers were fired at this time. 

Dada cannot, by law, hire people without the required certifications now. This is because the industry got so huge and is such a window to the outside world for Chinese students that the government had to regulate it. I don't know if they have hired a shit ton of ""housewives"" or not, but I am inclined to believe that, if they did, said housewives indeed meet the same qualifications the person posting or me have in order to get the job. 

This pay is just the industry standard now. Dada is meeting that curve. Stop blaming other workers and get mad at the system that asked us to be more qualified while subsequently paying us less."

Starting just a handful of days after the new year, Pluto, which has been transiting my 1st house for the last decade or so, will angle in opposition with my natal Mars in the 7th house. I am particularly troubled by how this will affect my life for the next three years. With my natal Pluto already in 11th house, you can imagine I've already faced a ton of bullying, collective gaslighting, and otherwise precarious and emotionally dangerous social situations. I don't think I can take much more of this. I'm trying to look for a silver lining here. My natal Mars is in retrograde in Cancer, so I was hoping maybe this meant this transformation would be more internal than external. My natal Mars in Cancer is also trine my natal Pluto in Scorpio, and my natal Pluto will be sextile this transiting Pluto throughout this P-M opposition transit. I know I'm desperately searching for some positives here, but I would really appreciate any feedback that isn't about male persuers, possible assault or rape, or otherwise aggressive social encounters. Any insight would be greatly appreciated, especially as pertains to my natal Mars being retrograde, in the 7th house, and in Cancer with this transiting Pluto being in my first house.

orthodontics,f8i9e47,t3_e0g7g2,1574585967.0,"The last few months of my braces, I had the same issue. My teeth were straight, I had had the braces on for almost two years, they just wanted to fix my overbite. To achieve this, I would need to use rubberbands. I did the same thing you did - moved my jaw forward to see how it would look - and I disliked it. So I basically just never wore the rubber bands. My mom got mad and eventually told them to just take my braces off and demanded a permanent retainer on the top and bottom. They said, ""because she didn't wear her rubber bands to fix her overbite, her teeth will ram into the permanent retainer and cause it to loosen and you'll have to keep coming back to replace it."" We said we'll take our chances. 

15 years later, I still have my permanent retainer on. It recently dislodged on one tooth because a shard of hard candy wedged itself into it, but my teeth are otherwise fine and haven't ""rammed"" into the retainer. Meanwhile, I had a friend who they said ""earned"" a permanent retainer for completing all her treatments, including rubber bands. Her teeth knocked it off at least once a year, and she finally settled for a removable night time one. 

Sidenote, I personally think most people look awful with a fixed overbite. I have one friend who looks like she's wearing fake Halloween teeth when she smiles and another that looks like she's opening her mouth as wide as she can with her teeth closed when she smiles. And this is permanent.

So, bottom line, if you don't like it, you don't like it, and you can still straighten your teeth without fixing the bite. It is possible. But you have to put your foot down - hard - like my mom and I did. You ARE the paying customer. I also think either way it's about how much money they can get off you. Every person is also different, of course, so I'm not sure how they're planning to fix your overbite, but not fixing mine with rubber bands hasn't proven detrimental and didn't otherwise compromise the straightness of my teeth."

I was merely offering an additional piece to the picture. I think the biggest pitfall of persons from colonizer/neo-colonizer countries who learn Arabic is over-politicizing every aspect of the language, culture, and people. When using that logic in your day to day interactions, though, it can be dehumanizing, erasing, and, especially as an American, can be viewed as an orientalist gaze. Especially with all the problematic implications of power embedded within the notion of being ""westernized."" As I said, I'm sure there are various political aspects to it, but I seldom meet people who intellectualize their experiences like this on the ground.

They also couldn't fathom that I'd want to live in Jordan. They were intensely Neo-Orientalist and didn't like to consider themselves Arab or a part of the Middle East. Perhaps this is why they wrote in English letters. I would shy away from politicizing this disposition or say that it's a part of a movement or political party. Perhaps it is in some capacity, but it was a common sentiment I experienced just with everyday, not-particularly-politically-involved Lebanese people."

Now that I have acknowledged my asexuality, I realize this is a cognitive dissonance created by the person I'm learning to listen to and be versus the person I've been taught I am, and in that process I am having to undergo a complete transformation of how I am relating myself to myself as well as to others in social spaces and situations. In short, it's just another layer of conditioning I have to learn to shed from myself while also navigating what actual conversation and demeanor I want to project into my environment.

The only people who have tried to shove the ""live and let live"" and ""projection!"" platitudes down my throat were people trying to claim some weird moral high ground while simultaneously gaslighting me for having the audacity to stand up to their shitty behavior."
AskReddit,eymtbdu,t1_eym0dsr,1567219313.0,"The black community is still without a lot of aids and rights. India is still feeling the effects of colonisation. I'm not saying supporting the embargo isn't something to be proud of. Just that we need to keep that in perspective when it just served as an impetus to economically subjugate and undermine the sovereignty of other lands. Although a well-placed move, the logic wasn't totally done away with and continued to be perpetuated by a more obscure logic of slavery."

DebateAnarchism,eyg6wl6,t3_cwkwnv,1567062771.0,"It's definitely going to facilitate more social unrest. Gig economy and independent contracting is a rising trend among corporations *because* they don't want to be fiscally responsible for our benefits. It effectively nullfies the need to maintain an entire human resource department to liaison on behalf of our benefits AND them having to ""pay"" for our benefits directly. Sure, they say they make up for it in higher hourly pay, but after the 1099, other neccesary insurances for health and whatnot, and realizing one gig SELDOM stays within the ""hourly"" time frame, that $18 an hour is not really $18 an hour.
