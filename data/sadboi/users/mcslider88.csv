bipolar,fp2hgen,t1_fp25wd1,1588261823.0,"Thank you for this comment. It gave me a little hope and a bit of a reality check I know I needed. Mainly knowing things change... and don‚Äôt always go back. 
That said I will try to take your suggestions to heart. I was getting back into exercise for a couple months before the lockdowns and have not kept up at home and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs not helping currently. I need to get back on that ü§£. 
What you described on how some things. ‚ÄúYou might feel like you‚Äôve lost a sense of who you once were‚Äù that‚Äôs it exactly and that‚Äôs what makes me so sad"
bipolar,fotbxf4,t1_fotbbom,1588049603.0,"I see that to on some levels. But even in the manic state when I‚Äôm doing better in my games. 
Let‚Äôs use the new doom for an example. Now I‚Äôm going through and tearing stuff up and doing great Now I just missed a bunch of the map I could have explored if I wasn‚Äôt all amped up. So yea I get some parts at times and I look forward to those episodes most days. But I feel I‚Äôm still missing so much"
bipolar,fotbn7w,t1_fotar9o,1588049385.0,Yea. Having a lot of my friends disappear was a bit of a hit. And after my son was born I spent even less time in NA and lost touch with new friendships I was starting to form.

AskReddit,fi6rbnz,t1_fi0h7a5,1582205345.0,What‚Äôs worse. One of those meds works wonders for me. It‚Äôs the first one to work well. I get free samples from my doctor. Guess how much it cost a month WITH my health insurance and a discount card!!! I‚Äôll give you a hint. 650$...

MakeNewFriendsHere,f55ggf5,t3_dmsr9f,1572007021.0,That‚Äôs awesome man good for you. I‚Äôve lost about 50 myself in the last year and a half. It was not easy. But the hardest part for me is making sure I still eat enough food. After all the weight loss a lot more stress kicked in for me and I need to make sure I eat. Stress makes me not eat
rickandmorty,f3ub2fd,t1_f3u6z2v,1571156594.0,"I‚Äôm not sure if I was clear. 
Package A- package says 500mg total thc. 10 pieces. I ate 350mg worth and felt meh
Package B (different brand) package says 100mg total thc. 10 pieces. I eat 80mg worth. Sleep on kitchen table. 
So what am I missing here. I‚Äôm legitimately curious"
rickandmorty,f3twrbg,t1_f3syzsx,1571147946.0,"Here is the thing. I‚Äôve had over 350mg of edibles from one company and was like meh. I‚Äôve had 80 mg from another brand and apparently it was made more potent. I passed out at my kitchen table playing wow...
Basically it comes down to how potent it is or how well OP made the edibles. That could be mild or he could wake up tomorrow"

bipolar,eu8vnal,t3_cf8hjb,1563565748.0,I‚Äôm currently in a dark place today. I think I‚Äôm creating my own problem due to med changes and being scared about it. This was nice to see so thanks for the share
mcsa,etwrgqw,t1_etvqy98,1563281985.0,Just so I know what‚Äôs the official book? That‚Äôs kinda what I‚Äôm trying to figure out

techsupport,er6j9t3,t3_c0ouk3,1560549049.0,I work for a MSP. Most cases if the old pc is anything less than an I3 we just tell the client buy a new pc. The work we will need to put in to try and make it functional will probably be half the price of a low end machine that‚Äôs 10 times better
techsupport,eohctpn,t1_eohcnew,1558578325.0,Fair enough. Then unfortunately I can‚Äôt help you from here without googling myself
techsupport,eohc944,t1_eohb3nb,1558577933.0,"If you are this concerned about your data I suggest you looking into cloud backup platforms. Such as acronis, crashplan, or carbonite. Those are the few I‚Äôve worked with. Crashplan for example you can see previous versions of data. So if it backs up the day before the virus you can go back a a day in backups and get uninfected data. 
I don‚Äôt know enough about local backups because I‚Äôve never put effort into that lol so I can‚Äôt answer your other questions."
