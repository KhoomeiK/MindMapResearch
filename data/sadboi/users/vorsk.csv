I actually think that the exact definition provided on wiki is too reductive and why I believe making the ideological argument makes more sense. Ideologically Bernie believes in a more symbiotic corporatist state. Not a five year plan Stalinist socialism (or fascism), but a grass roots socialism where workers gain more control over their labor within a democratic framework. 

I think it's picking nits.  I guess my argument would be that Warren believes in regulated capitalism, and Bernie makes a more fundamental structural argument, and for me that falls much more in-line with DS thinking as a general approach to governance. 

It is semantics, but that is how I read it.

bipolar,ev43hku,t1_ev1zm0e,1564206962.0,"It’s hard relating to others because to understand my suicidal behavior I have to approach it very rationally.  Others often view with great emotion. 

I stop taking my meds, my depression evokes as a flat affect (I recently came across the word acedia, defined as mentally or spiritually slothful, it is the best descriptor of my depression I have found) and the anxiety kicks in. 

Then I start drinking, because it works, it stifles the anxiety, but of course it will eventually exacerbate the depression. 

Then at some point I get suicidal. 

Then I’m in a psych ward. 

So to manage this I have to be matter of fact about suicidal thoughts and what leads up to it. 

Simply outlining the above really makes normies uncomfortable. 

I try to explain, “look I know this seems macabre and makes you uncomfortable, but I have to think about it this way, it has to be present in my thinking...”

This is usually met with confusion and unease and being told I shouldn’t think and talk about it so much. 

I retort “I have to think about it—daily, consistently—because it is the most dangerous thing in my life, this disease is actively trying to kill me.”

I don’t give two fucks if it makes you uncomfortable, and sharing your unease works only to at best diminish the reality and at worst is stigmatizing at and can drive people back into the closet. I get that it is hard to understand, but if you don’t understand it you should realize your opinion on how to fix it probably isn’t useful. 

I have become so much more aware of my disease in the last few months and it has caused me to be a lot more open in sharing my diagnosis and attributed struggles with people. It is not only personal for me, but also political. By being open I work to actively shed the stigma and hopefully normalize what bi-polar is. 

Anyway, that’s a digression. One further thought. At some point someone told me that a depressed person should not trust their own thinking. And this is what a lot of people miss. It was life altering for me once I started thinking about my depressed self in that way. 

I’m not just sad, or mentally slothful, or disinterested. I am in an altered psychological state, and I can’t trust my thinking at those times. The kicker is you have to know that you are in an altered state, a veritable catch-22. 

If I am aware then if I have to overcome the lethargy enough to both know I’m currently not firing correctly AND reach out for help. And that, my friends, is fucking hard and nearly unexplainable to someone who hasn’t experienced suicidal ideation. 

Selfish?  Man when I hear that. “How could they be so selfish?”  My thought process in that state is somewhere along the lines of “things would be better off I wasn’t here, my parents won’t have to visit another psych ward, no longer will anyone have to wait for the other shoe to drop, it will be hard on my loved ones, but I know they’ll be relieved it’s finally over, it would be easier on everyone”.  That is some dark shit and when I’m in a good place mentally, I have no idea how I could come to those conclusions. My depressed self is not a clear thinker. 

Like someone else wrote, in that altered psychological state, it is the opposite of selfish. Add a dash of self-loathing, thinking about the difficulty of starting over yet again, the anomie and loneliness felt and you got yourself a stew. 

I’ve been lurking awhile, but it is so nice to be able to ruminate on my experiences through others stories, words, and perspectives. It’s been a great help; thanks to all that post. 

And if one more person asks me why I stop taking my meds, well I’ll probably get frustrated at that person. “I’ve already told you how dangerous this disease is, don’t you think if I knew why I sometimes go non-compliant I would fix it?”  

“No, I don’t know why, and yes I do know I’ll end up back in the psych ward.  I don’t know why, it’s just part of the disease.”

“I know you don’t understand, if psychiatrists knew, don’t you think we’d have a proper intervention strategy, I just told you, I don’t know why.”

As fucking nauseam.  Needed to get that have my chest. 

Cheers and make sure to take your meds."
