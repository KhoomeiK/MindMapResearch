Every class might require a somewhat different approach, but it's good to have a starting plan and then tweak it from there depending on what you need.

I have always been a note-taker of some sort. When I have the time, I write my notes by hand. If I want to save time or if I ran out of paper, then I use my laptop and either type or annotate on slides. If I have time, I rewrite my notes; if I don't, then I either re-read or annotate on top of them. Sometimes, I write on whiteboards or scrap paper to make sure I can get down the details. Ideally, I would have time for multiple passes.

Some classes will benefit immensely from doing practice problems and making flash cards (or using pre-made ones); other classes don't really require much beyond class notes to do well. You have to feel out the course for yourself to see how you need to tweak your learning."
