At the end of the day scars are just scars and skin is only skin. You may have people look or make comments but at the end of the day none of that matters, you’ll find people who will support and accept you as you are without having to hide and if you don’t find them in school then even though it’ll be a bit shitty school will finish and you can know that you were who you wanted to be and did what you wanted not what you thought people expected. You can always wear long sleeves for a little in the beginning to gauge your surroundings and get to know who you click with without being conscious of your arms, but they’re nothing to be ashamed of.

selfharm,fbu5xt1,t3_eekbm2,1577108356.0,"Self harm isn’t comparable, the depth and scars doesn’t determine the pain you’re feeling. It’s a mindset that I fall into a lot and so do many people who self harm but it’s important to remind yourself that you don’t have to prove how much pain your in by making your physical pain more intense. 

In regard to keloids it varies from person to person and even with one individual there’ll be places where you get them and others where they won’t. I’ve gone deeper in one place and have a completely flat scar and not as deep in another and have a really raised scar. Again though having keloids doesn’t prove how much pain your in, it’s not something that going deeper will guarantee you and it’s not worth going deeper and having to deal with all the complications that come with it. 

Please take care of yourself, you’re valid and your pain is just as real as anyone else’s."

My scars from the beginning of this year still get itchy all the time, that should fade with more time, even when the scars are fully healed on the outside the inside can still be healing which is what causes deeper scars to itch for a long time. I hope it eases for you soon and you can move forward x"

selfharm,fbawdf1,t3_eccu1v,1576688193.0,It could be the rush of adrenaline and the shock your mind and body goes into. Be careful it can be really dangerous if you were to pass out while self harming. Take care
selfharm,fba0xc2,t3_ec77vn,1576658715.0,"It’s not easy to stop but it is possible and the fact that you want to stop is enough of a reason to do so. You haven’t fallen too far into self harm yet and I really strongly urge you to get away from sites that can trigger and push you further into the world of self harming.

Every time you have an urge you need to stop yourself, you are able to do that, you have the ability to hear those thoughts and choose to ignore them. 

There’s an app called Calm Harm, it gives yo activities to do to ride out these urges. You could also just do something, anything, to keep yourself occupied. For example on Monday I was having very strong urges so instead of acting on them I decided to create a letter for my friend in Germany, I drew sunflowers on the envelope, created a little pressed flower art for her and by the time I’d finished a few hours later the urge had lessened.

I’ve been stuck in this dark place for a year and a half, thinking that self harming was helping when all it’s done is push me further away from feeling like myself. I know what you’re going through if your life is difficult but self harm literally doesn’t help even if at the time it feels like it does. You deserve to feel okay, take care of yourself."

I had a similar situation where a coworker made a very awful “joke” about suicide and I was so shocked that I just laughed along, I felt like an idiot for not saying something but in the moment it can be hard to process that people still think that way. I hope you’re doing okay, take care"
selfharm,fb90u3a,t3_ec1if6,1576626511.0,"Anyone with a mindset like that is ignorant and doesn’t understand what self harm really is. Women are portrayed to be more emotional which is a lot of people’s justification as to why we self harm, “were just dramatic and irrational by nature so of course we would jump to self harm.” But that isn’t what self harm is. Self harm is a maladaptive coping mechanism that ANY individual regardless of race, gender, social background etc. May engage in to cope with whatever they may be going through.

The thought that men are “weak” for self harming is so f*cking damaging!! The rates of suicide in males is so high and this mindset people seem to have is not helping fight this! Men have emotions, men are allowed to feel things just as strongly as women. It really frustrates me because I’m sure in your class there would have been at least one guy who suffers with some form of mental illness, suicidal thoughts and/or self harm and hearing someone say something like that literally is like a punch to the stomach and pushes your further away from reaching out.

Sorry that was long I just want any guy reading this to know you deserve to feel, you aren’t weak for being human, people will support you and care about what you’re going through."
SelfHarmScars,fb74mfj,t3_ebomlw,1576573654.0,"Your self harm is completely valid. A lot, if not the majority, of people who self harm fall into the mindset of thinking their self harm isn’t “bad enough” but it’s not true. Anything you do with the intent of causing yourself harm is real and deserves to be taken seriously. There are people who have taken their own self harm very far and still say they feel like it’s not enough. It never will feel like enough, every time I do it I think if I make it worse I’ll feel relieved but I still feel like they aren’t enough even though I now have scars that will never go away. Please just try to remember that there is no level of self harm which dictates it’s validity.

In regards to making them go away in 3 days it depends on how your body heals but I would say that there will still be visible marks. I personally wear a long sleeve rashie or bathers and if people ask why I’m wearing it I just say something along to lines of “oh I got a bad sunburn the other day so I need to keep it covered so it doesn’t get worse” or “I just feel more comfortable wearing it” or even “agh I just can’t be bothered putting on sunscreen all the time because I burn so quickly” most people don’t push it past that. You could also try using makeup but that’s more likely to come off in the water.

You don’t have to feel like you need to hide them though, they don’t make you any less of a person and they don’t control who you are and how people perceive you. But I do understand jay there are situations where you just don’t want people to see. Be kind to yourself x"
selfharm,fb70036,t3_ebgd6y,1576567135.0,"I started a year and a half ago (oh how the time flies), it was something that I had thought of before a handful of times but I never really thought I would go through with it. I was also really uneducated about self harm before I started. The first time I tried was with nail clippers a few years ago but I remember just feeling too overwhelmed and like it wasn’t really something I wanted to do so I stopped. Then last year it was too much and I started and continued because nothing changed I was in a dark place and I was almost comfortable. I did go to the doctor to try and stop a month or two in but that was a waste of time that only made me feel like I had to go deeper. 
I just needed something to cope because I felt so alone, angry and out of control. It wasn’t until September that I really started relying on it more frequently.
I had no clue I’d be where I am now, I have scars on my arm that will never go away but I can’t stop and I don’t want to because stopping makes me feel so disgusted with what I’ve done.

selfharm,fafor7t,t3_e8xdsj,1576028108.0,"It’s never a fun situation to be put in but just remember that most people are pretty unaware of self harm and what exactly it is. You don’t have to answer anyone if you don’t want to. Some things you could say are 
“That’s not something I want to talk about”

Or if you’re more comfortable with the person you can say 
“I went through/am going through a tough time but I’m receiving support”

Keep it very short and blunt so they get the idea that it’s not really something you want to go into. Confidence is key (even if you have to completely fake it) sometimes I practice answers so that if someone ever did see my scars I have go to responses to shut the conversation down. It’s an overwhelming situation to be in so having some answers ready can make it easier to cope with.

You can of course go down the more lighthearted route even tho self harm isn’t a funny thing sometimes it can help you and the other person if you make it more lighthearted (if that makes sense). There are tons of videos on YouTube with responses like these!! 

Also (sorry this is so long lol) but you could always do kind of what I want to do when I’m brave enough to wear short sleeves and say stuff like this 
Person: “what’s on your arm/leg/wherever?” 
You: “what do you think it is?” Or just “scars”
 Because chances are they already know so giving them more of an explanation isn’t necessary, they know so call them out for being insensitive (if they are coming from a not so nice place if they genuinely care then you can always be a little kinder wth your response)

The most important thing to remember is that it’s your body, you don’t need to give anyone a reason or excuse for wearing clothes that make you comfortable (or in your case that you don’t have a choice in what you wear). You don’t owe people a reason for you existing the way you are.

mentalhealth,f7khle1,t3_dwof1p,1573810746.0,I’m not sure if it’s available in your country but kids helpline has an online chat in Australia and I’ve had really good experiences on there :) they listen to me talk about my self harm without judging me. I hope you find something that works soon
selfharm,f7h0ll2,t3_dw4jn7,1573727714.0,"I 100% get what you mean. I feel like a lot of people who self harm go through this, it’s almost like trying to validate it to yourself?"
Nails,f7alwe1,t3_du8e80,1573532744.0,I’d say lash glue wouldn’t hold for long as nothing too strong can be used for eye products. As the other commenter said there are nails which have the adhesive already on them which may be a good alternative :))
Nails,f7aj8zf,t3_dv4bf2,1573530694.0,My nails were the exact same as yours a little over a week ago and I had enough of feeling self conscious. What I did was put on a coat of OPIs nail envy nail polish (so far I’m loving it it’s nice and protective) I then have been using OPIs Avoplex exfoliating cuticle treatment all around the sides and tops of my nails about 2-3x a day and gently pushing the cuticles back. I also got a pretty sheer iridescent nail polish to put on so it was subtle but makes them look all shiny and pretty to motivate me to leave them alone. Just make sure you moisturise and you’ll notice a difference very soon like I did xx
