BingeEatingDisorder,fqoml7d,t3_gjyfyx,1589518864.0,"Hi, I've recorded a podcast on meal timing that you might find helpful [here](https://www.barexbrave.com/weight-loss-meal-timing-lyh-podcast-ep2/).  


To give you and idea, this is my ideal meal timing throughout the day...

**Breakfast**: 6:00 - 7:00**am**  
 Or within the first hour or so of waking and be sure not to skip it. Another tip is to get some sunlight first thing in the morning as this will help to naturally switch on your bodies circadian rhythm. 

**Snack**: 10:00 - 10:30**am** 

**Lunch**: 12:30 - 1:30**pm**  
 This should be your biggest meal of the day and should be consumed when the sun is at its peak - this will ensure ultimate metabolism of food. 

**Snack**: 3:00 - 4:00**pm** 

**Dinner**: 6:00 - 7:00**pm**  
 This should be your smaller of the three main meals and preferably foods that are easily digestible. 

Dinner should be consumed around 3- 4 hours before you go to sleep. This is to allow the body to digest the food when you're awake, instead of trying to do it when it should be repairing and restoring your body for the next day.   
I've created a free guide for binge eaters,  if you would like to know more you can download it [here](https://beatbingeeating.barexbrave.com/lead-magnetyvi6knk)"
BingeEatingDisorder,fqoli1v,t3_gk0asi,1589518081.0,"If you want to recover from binge eating I would start with the below (please note that there are many reasons as to why someone suffers from binge eating, but it’s good to ensure the below are in balance first).

**Macronutrient balance:**  
Macronutrients are nutritional compounds that your body needs in significant quantities for daily functioning. The three macronutrients are carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. While each type supplies you with most of the energy you need to operate, they all have different roles in your body overall.

Ensuring we are getting a good balance of all macronutrients is essential when trying to stop binge eating because when our brain senses that we are lacking specific nutrient it starts to go into survival mode as it believes that there may be a famine. When we are in this survival mode it can trigger intense feelings of hunger as it is trying to get you to eat the food that it needs to be in balance. This can cause you to have intense food urges - hence the binging cycle.

I know it may seem like a good idea to restrict calories/macros for weight loss, but I guarantee that in the long run this will directly work against you. It's so important to create a healthy food balance in order for your body to find it's natural flow state.

**Stop skipping meals:**  
Often a binge can occur because of a lack of food amount - those who regularly skip meals.

In this instance, a binge will be occur because the body has gone into the stress response and the primal brain has taken over - the body senses a lack of food or type of nutrient and will trigger intense urges in hope that you will consume what it needs.  


**Decreasing stress:**  
In order to binge the body MUST BE in a stress response. You cannot binge unless you are in this fight or flight state (decreased digestion, decreased metabolism, increase of our stress chemicals insulin and cortisol).

So relax a little. A binge is a message. A binge is a symptom for other areas in our life that need focus. If we do not learn how to take a step back, breathe, and check in - then we will never understand the deeper message for what our body is calling from us.

Take some time to list out the areas in your life that are causing you the most stress , then brainstorm ways that you could decrease this stress. For example if work is causing you stress, you could make time for a slow walk and 5 minutes of meditation at lunch time.  


**Speed at which you eat and presence:**  
Are you a fast, moderate or slow eater? Eating fast puts your body in a low level stress response. It will take the brain a longer time to process the food that you are eating and therefore the brain will continue to send hunger signals which cause you to overeat.

Have you ever heard someone say it takes 20 minutes for you to feel full? This is absolutely right! The brain is amazing and complex but it also needs relaxation and presence. Slow down! Savour your meal, taste the flavours and chew more.

Being present when you eat is also a major factor that influences our body in a similar way that fast eating does. When the brain is distracted it can take a longer time to process what you are eating and therefore will keep sending signals for you to keep eating, until it has caught up.

I urge you to always set aside time for meals and snacks. Be present when you are eating and really focus on the food.

loseit,fom6v38,t3_fooqo4,1587880029.0,Fasting during the day could be a big reason why you're binging at night. Not giving your body the nutrients it needs during the day will cause it to go into starvation mode until it gets the nutrients it needs.  Try eating healthy balanced meals during the day.

BingeEatingDisorder,foe74p5,t3_g5p31i,1587697371.0,"I suffered from binge eating and bulimia for 4–5 years and never thought recovery was ever going to be an option.

After getting quite sick (physically) I decided that enough was enough. I started to do my own research and apply strategies that I came across. I started to eat REGULAR meals and stop skipping meals throughout the day. I focused on including a balance of macronutrients in my diet and I also included pleasurable foods (the foods that once would trigger my binge). When I allowed pleasurable foods into my diet, it took away that feeling of ‘missing out’.

I decided that I wanted to really dive into my recovery so I studied eating psychology. This course taught me how important nourishing our bodies is, and how I have to start becoming my own biggest cheerleader, instead of my own worst enemy.

I started to apply self love strategies, exercised in a way that made me FEEL good, ate in a way that made nourished my body, created morning and night routines that would start and end my day in the best way possible, and really focused on who I wanted to become.

The course gave me the qualifications to now help others. I have since created a beat binge eating online coaching course and have my own podcast with lots of free information about binge eating called ‘[love yourself healthy’](https://www.barexbrave.com/love-yourself-healthy-podcast/) podcast. I spend my time helping others create the same freedom around food that I now have.
