-The Beetlejuice one: just boring and plain

-Kid Cool: Same as Beetlejuice, and Day Dreaming Davey to a lesser extent, it just seemed forced like there wasn't much to talk about with these games but he still needed to release something.

Those two aspects are really not that important though, fundamental understanding of animation principles and other drawing skills are always what matter the most. As for how much it took, since I was stuck in a graveyard shift at the time, I only worked on it on my free time and didn't pay much attention to how long it took but I'd estimate around 10-12 hours of work."

Advice,epjrtk9,t3_buz8tf,1559258889.0,"Being surrounded by people who love you doesn't mean you're immune to loneliness. What makes us feel that way is a lack of deep connections with others, it's not a problem with you or the people in your life, sometimes it's hard to open yourself up to others, and some people just can't empathize with your feelings. Some things that have helped me in the past with this are:

 - Appreciating your time alone a bit more, it's nice to allow yourself to be alone and content with it.
- Trying to open up to others with no expectations, some people are better than others at this like I said, so use your judgement and test the waters with people who may be willing to listen
- Try new things with your loved ones, sometimes, going to watch a movie or doing something together that you don't usually do can help you feel closer.
- Listen to your friend's problems, feels nice to help others who need to vent and can also make you feel closer to them.
- This one's obvious but going out to new places to make new friends really does help, doesn't need to be in real life, join a discord server, subreddit, a forum, somewhere where you can interact with the same people several times.

But the most important part is always within you, I know it's super hard, but learning to be happy with just yourself is the key."
