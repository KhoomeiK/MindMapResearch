During the acid trip it can be a blast for hours, then 1 bad hour just feels so shitty that you forget that you were just safe and having a good time. If you already dissociate I'd make sure to set up extra precautions and grounding things, cause even if you don't dissociate it can feel similar to it. I've been disassociating since like 5 yrs old it's not something very scary to me normally, just strange, but sometimes life isn't anything more than strange and those disconnected feelings come and go. I've had some messed up times coming down from acid but I found the experience worth the bad moments. 

If you're going to trip, know what you're getting yourself into and understand it can make the dissociation worse even after the trip is over, and sometimes long after. Personally I'd recommend shrooms over acid, I know a psychedelic is a psychedelic no matter what but based on my personal experience shrooms felt like intense meditation, very connected, while acid makes me mostly always feel disconnected even if I had a good time. The worst part of shrooms is coming down and losing that disconnection, it's like being birthed back into an ugly reality. Anyway acid can be safe just don't take too much and set up precautions, abusing it usually causes more problems than a one-time bad trip"

Moon/pluto is also very cold and can freeze up and feel ""nothing"" though is usually more like a tsunami and the numb feeling is from being so overwhelmed and overstimulated.

For me it was actually a big build up / tower moment and then release. Still depressed. It feels like surgical holes made in your body so.. the healing process is painful but in an emotional way they can fill with the 'good stuff' easier too. I truly do feel like I'm becoming more of myself and unapologetically. I'm gaining self control after I thought I already had a lot of it. 

Maturity. Saturn is in my first rn too though. With that north node thing I imagine you're becoming more of yourself too, evolving towards your purpose. Your soul signed up for whatever evolution you're about to undertake, it just completed an older karmic or evolutionary process with the 12H transit (haven't experienced pluto through all your houses in this life & body but the outer planets are not as much about the physical, they're more soul-based and pluto is especially about soul evolution) 

Could sound intimidating but when Pluto moves into house of self it makes you feel more equipped to handle what comes up, anyway. You'll have a lot of experience & tools at your disposal now with that whole cycle behind you but it may creep up slower and evolve over a longer period of time and not be recognizable straight away like another commenter said.

ptsd,fgsxe6w,t3_ezy1fe,1581094634.0,"Hey, please look into trauma bonding. Sometimes the rough patches (especially in abuse victims, where the 'rough patches'are being abused) can make us feel closer to someone who has no ability to keep us safe like we should be in the relationship. Even if this person somehow deep down has a good heart or even good intentions, unfortunately right now he is unable to act on that, if the good is in fact there. I'm sure him telling you he would never leave you felt like seeing a 'good' part of him but from an outsider's perspective it is nothing special to end an abusive outbreak with bandaging the wounds. It is just another part of the cycle of abuse. And I do believe you're being abused, emotionally at the very least, as all that toxic cheating behavior and lying is very unhealthy and is no solid base to raise up a child from. Which your child deserves and I trust that you want to give him.

There may be local programs that can assist you or provide safe housing if you dont have fam or friends to turn to. You dont have to leave him but being repeatedly broken (especially while trying to be a new mom) it's like, how much can you or should you take? How much stress should you and the baby have to subjected to? I think you have a right to peace and stability and I don't think he is able to provide that the way a father and partner should. Maybe later down the line but it takes a lot for someone to change, and unfortunately having a child is not the way for the majority of people (I dont think his child will make him 'wake up' and suddenly grow emotionally in ways that would normally take years of self reflection and therapy). He is giving you nightmares and disturbing sleep when it is supposed to be that you're both tired from tending to the new baby in the middle of the night... it's not going to be the family that you pictured because that's just the desire and wish, it's not the reality of the situation and you have to work with the reality of your situation first before you try to work towards the wish.

AskAstrologers,fgii7gk,t3_eyk2pi,1580822406.0,"I have this same problem, I'm a cap rising tho but I also have Pluto in the 11th. Truly it lives and dies and i mourn over 'lost friends' (some of the bridges i burned, some of those ppl were toxic, some of them I loved wholly and they left). Karma is intense and your chart ruler IS pluto. Your moon touches neptune so I imagine the drinking is your escape. Your venus is at an anaretic (important) degree of 0 so there are lessons in love and a lot of new things to experience. Cancer mars can cause domestic issues. Your mercury is on top of your venus so plenty of communication will be important and with your sun ruled by mercury it causes nervousness too. If you're struggling mentally it's okay to seek help rather than suffer in silence or repress some things going on through drinking. You need an outlet (maybe a creative one) and also it's important for you to be in clear communications with your loved ones. You're probably not as hard to be around as you think. A lot of people resist intensity or depth just as a default, or some they can't really put their finger on can be intimidating. I'm sorry you're dealing with it though I know I can't really help or fix it with one post but I hope everything turns out okay for you. 💙"
ptsd,fgdnmrv,t3_exthg0,1580684515.0,"Also aside from trauma, overracting or anything of that, there is like... no such thing as it being overreacting when you need someone to stop touching you and to respect your personal space. You decide what the limits of your personal space are. Any alarm bells or discomfort you feel is a SIGNAL that something needs to stop or change or be called attention to. Not that you should even have to discuss these boundaries with him (he is being extremely inappropriate) but your brain is telling you it's a no and whether that is coming from trauma or not you have a right to demand bodily autonomy and respect. I hope everything goes okay and your friend can help you sort this out some. 💙"

ptsd,fg8pr9d,t3_exjims,1580627714.0,"PTSD is extremely impactful on relationships of all sorts, in my experience. If you're communicating what's going on then what else can you do? For some people it might take some time and research on their behalf, to understand something that imo you don't understand unless you have it. Some people just aren't very supportive or understanding regarding these types of things. The less experience someone has with mental illness, in themself or others, I think the less likely it will be that they'll even attempt to understand. But a true good friend would try, and the fact that you've been communicating but they're still acting overly defensive or angry is not a sign of a good friend. Hopefully they will come around and understand that their response could have been a more sensitive one"
Depersonalization,fg8ldex,t1_fg8l7pp,1580623229.0,Ketamine isn't physically addictive and the high is comparable to THC in small amounts or 'bumps'. High is usually shorter and more controllable than with weed. Not suggesting you k-hole
Depersonalization,fg8l14n,t3_ewwxl2,1580622890.0,Well. Ketamine is obvious and known for enhancing music but that is a dissociative so not sure if youd like it (I've felt not so awesome on it before but it doesnt do the paranoia like weed). Microdosing shrooms could be something to consider maybe? And MDMA but that shouldn't be a regular thing

It's sometimes harder to 'spot' in women because the symptoms can present differently and is sometimes like the last thing one would consider. But I encourage u to look up ADHD symptoms and ADHD in adults + women. I'm not sure about the floaty feeling, that may just be a general anxious feeling but I can relate and it does sound somewhat DPDR but like I said I'm not a dr. I know that anxiety is very very common in ppl with ADHD too and targeting the ADHD can help other things like anxiety and depression."

AskAstrologers,ffrx2y5,t1_ffppypn,1580167839.0,"Sorry it's long and rambly.

Since your sun is first of all your chart ruler and second of all at an anaretic degree (29°-0°) I feel it is extremely important. Sun in 5th, your EGO DEVELOPMENT is of utmost importance. Ruled by saturn, it is a lesson for this lifetime. In a past life (12house) cancer, I imagine you were extremely giving and self sacrificing. Trying to heal family. Jupiter and chiron do relate to healing an expansion, and with it ruled by cancer it would be spiritual healing, working with nurturing children/family, or through close relationships. You likely ""lost yourself"". This is not the goal anymore, even though there are still pieces of this evident in your psyche. Libra moon desires relationships and reflects on others' emotions to know their own. Heir environment is important. This is also conjunct your IC, showing more of your past (and past life). Caught up in other people. You could have had a loving but somewhat smothering mother who needed you to be conscious of her emotional and mental state, who needed you to care for others and not just worry about your own self as a kid. Grew up too fast maybe. Our past life can show up in our childhood as well-parent & child is generally karmic but it's not always black and white so idk maybe she wasnt that way. Like she was still loving but busy and concerned with other people, maybe caught up in her own bad relationships. You have to learn about relationships here. Healthy relationships with freedom and open ways of communicating and expressing love is important. You may be tempted to be with people who repeat past karmic patterns and kind of smother you and act territorial in a way or try to mother you. Your idea of freedom is different from other peoples so finding someone who understands it is going to be crucial imo.
Anyway so yeah self identity, discovery and creativity is the name of the game here. Being big headed sometimes could just be part of the karma honestly lol. Leo asc can become v disconnected from others tho and not see their actions affecting people so much, but hopefully with your mars sextiling your venus you can feel that more. Caution that you don't use people like u may have used in the past, continue treating people w the respect u want to be given. Freedom in relationships and support for your bigger visions and dreams. I think you must have some sort of creative aspiration, it wouldn't have to be art or poetry or whatever, creativity can happen in all sorts of ways. It doesnt have to make you money but I wouldn't be surprised if you made money from it. The real world is kind of new to you because of being caught up in other peoples emotional worlds in the past, or struggling with your own emotional self. What you can build, fix, create and do here to represent yourself really means something and is impactful to others. Your emotional self will die and be reborn repeatedly, growing stronger each time."
AskAstrologers,ffrulwx,t3_euhat3,1580166183.0,"Mercury is naturally associated with nervousness and so is uranus and pluto. Harsh aspects create tension which can cause more anxiety. 

•Moon in 3rd house (3rd house being gemini)
•moon receiving many harsh aspects making emotional part of life full of tension and difficulty. No aspects = doom but of course harsh aspects will feel harsher than a soft aspect like a trine. Your moon might feel like it is doomed though, causing fantasy of loss, death
•Moon inconjunct mercury (moon-mercury contacts known for anxiety. unhealthy ways of expressing nervousness, irrational thinking and getting caught up and absorbed-->also seen with your moon squaring Pluto)
•your chart ruler is in the 6th house (virgo) in the sign gemini. Your chart ruler Jupiter squares your sun and moon. Opposite pluto in 12th and pluto oppositions are intense. 
Pluto is destructive, difficult, powerful. You're afraid of yourself sometimes or your thoughts maybe, of being alone or maybe of death.
•sun in Virgo
•pluto in 12th can cause paranoia and self destruction. Also squaring your sun and moon. 
•Mars opposite uranus=tension with a 'nervous' planet and an energizing planet in tension

There might be more but this is making my head hurt lol. You've got a hell of a lot of mercury and since your chart ruler is Jupiter, that could balance you out. Study Jupiter in your chart, learning trust may be difficult for you but would help anxiety if there was faith that things would turn out alright. 
Obviously anxiety is a complex psychological disorder but I hope the fact that there is some of this evident in your chart feels validating. As a fellow anxiety sufferer I wish you lots of healing."

AskAstrologers,ffpi9oq,t3_euhj9m,1580095695.0,"Well her venus is in 8th. 8th can be submissive in it's own way, submissive to the act and to being consumed by someone else. You didn't expect it because it stays hidden away, reserved for the other person that she chose. Submission has an element of dominance. It's consent to something and surrender to someone else's pleasure which can be very pleasing and feel like you're dominating by just allowing...idk had to explain. 
Also looks up Mars conjunct lilith lol. She has that, and again it's in the 8th. Look up lilith in the 8th too. 

Libra sun aims to please and enjoy submitting to something exciting and letting another take control. Sometimes they initiate (as a cardinal sign) the dominance, like they subtly suggest another to dominate them. 
Virgo mercury-mind of submissive (stereotype virgin). Opposing moon in pisces - pisces go with the flow and surrender to the situation and the moon comes out in sexual relations. The virgo desire for some control or having things ""just right"" kind of ceases and it's left up to her partner. Mercury 9th house guides and moon 3rd house is instead very ""allowing"" and permissive, open and again mutable so more going with the flow..."

Seroquel/quetiapine can be prescribed for PTSD but not everyone likes it. Also, weed, 100% is the best for stopping bad dreams and getting to sleep. I used to have to wake up in the middle of the night and smoke again, but usually just once after like 4 hrs. CBD is important to have with it as it's an antipsychotic and will help sleep. It would help for peaceful sleeping too but nowhere near what THC+CBD do together. Benzos also help me sleep but prob shouldnt use them for that regularly, just if there's nothing else. I'm sure a doc would be able to help you get on prescribed sleeping pills if you're up for it."
