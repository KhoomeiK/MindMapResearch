No excuses though , I have been letting this shit control me but also pandemic season so it’s been a bit more stressful. I was supposed to get surgery on my shoulder for instance but it’s an “elective” surgery and thus has been put on the back end . I have all reasons in the world to say why it’s hard but i really need to take back control , I lost control while in the service and have been struggling to feel comfort and peace since ."

personalfinance,fo1ch04,t1_fo11axy,1587430298.0,It’s a 2015 Dodge Challenger . I owe pretty much the whole loan amount which was around 31k . It’s probably down to 29 now at least. My interest rate was like 9.8 I believe but I’ll have to check when I get the car back(maintenance). Per kbb I believe i last saw it valued at 23k but now with everything blowing up and me having driven it another 8k miles (32000 btw) who knows...
personalfinance,fo1blu7,t1_fo1339q,1587429770.0,"Thanks for responding, yea I did but idk. It’s located in the window you know? Like every other car but unlike every other car , or at least the last two I had , it doesn’t look like it’s apart of the dashboard but more like a sticker. 
 It’s like under the dash and between the window  in a way where I can’t easily touch it so idk , I’ve been trying to get my life together and was hoping to find a lawyer or something about it later"

mentalhealth,fkkdjlv,t3_fixn7w,1584281345.0,I’m really not sure if that helps lol. And I’m also not condoning drugs because addictions are easily one of my top 5 regrets. But what I’m trying to get across is You’re not alone. And things do get better. Oh and I do where my seatbelt cause my car yells at me if not .
mentalhealth,fkkd9ld,t3_fixn7w,1584281132.0,"This is very relatable. I’m coming around from some pretty bad depression and by coming around I’m just having a few not too rough days. Like the therapist all pretty much say you have to define your value and find it in yourself , you’re a great person but you have to believe that for yourself first. Something like that idk. I still feel like this. And if it’s any encouragement I’m 22 started smoking , did a fair amount of drugs , drunk and drove a fair amount of times. Idk I don’t ever directly put myself at risk but I say fuck it a lot too just because of how it feels.for instance : I go to a party cause I’ve been in the house for a month . I drink because I’m uncomfortable and shy and want to loosen up. I loosen up and start talking to idiots and want to leave . I leave . ... it’s hard to just leave at that but I guess whatever happens happens . I just want to keep my mind so like the therapist say i try to embrace myself. Even though sometimes I think I’m really not meant to be here ."

RobinHoodPennyStocks,fj9bvqh,t3_fc9fsg,1583141244.0,Think I can get in more positions later or should I sit back in watch I’m in 300 but with a decent cost average of .77 I want more but I also don’t want to be greedy any recommendations?
RobinHoodPennyStocks,fivlepz,t3_fa21gl,1582762671.0,WEED STOCKS ARE GOONA BOOM THOUGH IM JUST SAYIN
RobinHoodPennyStocks,fivlcva,t1_fivkafh,1582762640.0,Thank you! I was just gonna review and say that what I’m really asking is “should I keep investing in what I believe in or are there less speculative stocks that I should go for instead” I haven’t really found any etfs or indexes in my price range but having more stability in my portfolio will put my mind at ease because rn I’m just throwing cash at whatever sounds good
RobinHoodPennyStocks,fivkpif,t1_fivkafh,1582762251.0,No most of my stocks like fcel and I’ve been in for awhile now and I want to hold them long. The only one where I really just “hopped in” was TBLT because it was the only stock I saw Monday not completely crashing . I try to buy when things look like tgeyre either conglomerating or falling and I trust they’ll go up. However regardless of how I buy I gotta admit to myself that all these stocks are very speculative. And may not be worth holding long as I intially intended . TBLT is definitely probably gonna be sold but like I said I’m just kinda getting antsy
RobinHoodPennyStocks,fi4pip1,t1_fi2uip4,1582145874.0,"Yea ,piggy backing off of what was already said but I get where you’re coming from. As a newer investor a bankruptcy seems like the worst case scenario for any company you’re in . However , and please correct me if I’m wrong ,when a company does go bankrupt what they’ll do is sell pretty much every asset they own . Property, stocks , patents , etc. and with that income they’ll pay who needs to get paid for aiding the company however they did. CEO and big boys first all the way down to us the investors community."
personalfinance,fh710p6,t1_ffzvnd0,1581311520.0,"Hello . 

First, I’d like to thank you after everything that’s happened I’ve been dealing with a lot of anxiety and knowing the numbers just don’t add up started to avoid all phone calls. I’ve already talk to two of my creditors since reading your post and so far , they seem to be pretty understanding and willing to help. 
 
I’m working with a vso vaguely but aside from helping me process my claims that I wasn’t able to process immediately after discharge, they haven’t really helped me with any other type of counseling. However I’ll definitely look into military onesource. Idk, I think I’ve just been defeated hearing your response was really encouraging to me. But dealing with the VA and jumping through these hoops have not been. I know no one really asked but my life really got turned upside down in the worst of ways in literally less than a year . Now I’m having panic attacks , no sleep , not eating all types of shit ... and it’s just been tough. I want to start school . It’d help a lot of my income problems with the GI bill but at the same time , I’m dealing with so much mentally and financially I feel like if I just hopped in I’m doomed to fail . So I’ve been holding out and just researching. Idk it’s been difficult going through this , I think I really just need to vent ...."
personalfinance,ffylkva,t1_ffykr0m,1580349323.0,"I’m currently scraping by with just unemployment as I wait for my disability claims and insurance policies to payout . Which sums up to 1200 a month . I agree 100% though I feel like selling my car would alleviate so much financial stress , I don’t need it to work as I’m not working but I do plan to move to Georgia to attend more house once I get stabilized in my treatment . I don’t want to lose my only source of transport for that one reason and if getting a cheaper car is possible I’m definitely open to it. I just don’t know how feasible it’ll be with my low income and currently terrible credit."
personalfinance,ffyk7dj,t1_ffyjp2z,1580348394.0,"I think I can get 20k for it owing 27 k on it . I’ve been advised against selling since it’s my only form of transportation and don’t really have the means of replacing it. I live far from any public transport and given the nature of my situation I kinda got where they(my family) is coming from. I tried to get out of my current phone plan and the told me I couldn’t because I was on a contract I didn’t really investigate any further afterward being kinda overwhelmed I still owe on my phone so And it’s broken (screen cracked), that’s probably why also my car is damaged on the front lip from truck debris on the highway and , not getting the licenses plate. I’ve been told I’ll have to pay a 500$ deductible to get it repaired"
personalfinance,ffyji5l,t1_ffyizne,1580347913.0,I have my car bill which is my biggest thorn in my side at 580/m my car insurance which is 140/m but is supposed to double because of the state I’m in now. Then my phone bill which is high at 140/m with just my line on the plan. Credit card debt which is around 7k now honestly just haven’t checked in awhile because of my inability to stop the interest from eating me that’s pretty much it . I only have been paying my car note and insurance and my phone bill while I try to keep above water
fatFIRE,fck5dmn,t3_ehmjkk,1577717069.0,I hear you guys. I’m not particularly FAT and I’ve really only provided a rough outline as to how I get to fat however . I thought I would appeal to the asset of time in posting hear simply because I’m 22 in route to 8000 in passive income my assets are only now just beginning to grow. I apologize however if you feel this post to be inappropriate to this forum .ill consider better next time I post . Honestly I this my one if my first post because I really don’t use technology but I thought I’d inform this community since I’m proud of my achievement.
fatFIRE,fck4qtm,t3_ehmjkk,1577716551.0,"Im glad you asked , as I mentioned the income generated is passive . And seeing as that I can easily live off 50% of my income (and most likely more than that) I’ve done enough research to see how viable an approach it’ll be. I already have investing accounts that I’ve had opened since I was 20 and if the growth continues even my acorns account will be prettty good lookin. I say I haven’t done the math but the math really isn’t hard to do."
psychology,etpfs0w,t3_bxyg9v,1563054265.0,"It is because 'Extreme political views' are , when done by some, truly a subject worth the most absurd, lengthy and diligent preponderance. For what lies at the end of politics , it is fairness peace unity , on a global scale.Can you imagine the weight?""Trouble thinking about their own thinking"" BAH! The issue is we must consider all thinking.For in the end ,what is truly fair and how and what do we base it...The question seems simple at first to shallow and deep thinkers alike(bewilderingly obscure to those in between). There is no answer or you have an answer.where do you fall i wonder? I've stopped thinking of policies and have began thinking of perspective. And conclusively i must say , world peace is possible. An extreme claim, when you consider our extreme world , why yes , I must say if your views are anything outside the realm of extreme they musn't be views for our world . So yes, some people have trouble with their thoughts . I mean imagine the weight once again.Of thinking you could change the world. Yet lacking the means, the ability, the stage, or the freedom, the power. They can stir troublesome and cluttered thinking to say the least. So much so,that is  it is often these  men and woman may seem extreme . for the sake of peace. not only for themselves but for as many people as they can logically(usually) hope to hamper. In their kingdoms or villages , their provinces or territory every civilization to have ever existed has in some way or another attempted to create their own personal peace.....the depth of this practice and what that entails however, is something deeply troubling. For what should be more important to us ,than us? It becomes almost understandable the heinous ,vicious act of war when truly deliberated.Almost."
