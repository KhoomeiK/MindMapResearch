AmItheAsshole,fmh2a7i,t3_fv2t98,1586064460.0,"A medically induced abortion is not only painful as fuck, but can be long. Like 2 days long. With lots of bleeding, horrific cramps, potential vomiting and loud crying. It was single handedly the worst pain I have ever experienced in my life. I cried for hours in between vomiting and laying in bed shaking from the pain while my mom held me.

As someone who has been raped and had to terminate the pregnancy, I am going to say 100% NTA. Sure, you had to lie to your ex. But she was never entitled to know any of it in the first place. It's not anyone's business to tell people about other people's trauma. She asked you to keep her and her secret safe, and you did just that. You are a hero, OP. If my family wasn't pro choice, and I didn't have anyone to depend on like you, I would have killed myself instead of being forced to birth. You very well may have saved her life. Thank you for helping her keep her autonomy."

I flashed him my engagement ring and he said he wanted to be my friend and he was so lonely. I was 20 and he was 39. I gave him a fake phone number thinking he would leave me alone after the flight as he kept touching my hand and trying to touch me, and he tried to follow me off the plane. I had to book it into customs so he would be caught behind other people in line. I kept making eye contact with people, hoping someone would say something, but no one stepped up.

I was in NYC, coming home from a night out with my friends. It was probably around 4am, and I was a good number of drinks in, and this was when I was doing drugs, so I was pretty coked up as well. This guy found me at the subway station, tried talking to me, and then claims he wants to be friends. I tell him I'm engaged. He says okay, he's not trying to do anything. We get on the train and he puts his arm around me, and there I sit, messed up to high heaven, praying someone will see my discomfort. No one did. I got off, he followed me. I fed him cigarettes like they were candy so he would have his mouth occupied. I tried to take a different route home because I didn't want him knowing where I lived. He kept following. So I told him I had to go to sleep. ""But you should come home with me and do more coke and drink and blahblahblah."" I tell him no. I see a cop car at the intersection. I stare, trying to signal to this cop through my facial expression that I need help. He never left the car. The dude grabs me, starts trying to touch me, and I had to knock his hat off while dodging his kisses so I could distract him for long enough to run away.

These are two of too many examples.

If you see someone that looks uncomfortable around somebody else, PLEASE SAY SOMETHING.

Edit: I wanted to add that I have PTSD so often I end up freezing in these scenarios. If you are able to say something, please do, as it is your best option. But in these situations, in particular the one in NYC, I absolutely felt like my safety was on the line and if I had ran to the cop car or made any sudden movement, he would have grabbed me and I would have gotten seriously hurt. He had his hand on me the entire time and it only got worse once we left the train. If I had seen an MTA employee or other official in the subway station, I would have spoken up."

That is such a big overstep of boundaries, I really have no idea where to begin. Having fantasies and keeping them to yourself is one thing. Photographing your crush secretly, drawing him into sexual acts with you, showing him and then blatantly hitting on him after you already put him in a very vulnerable position is a big issue. Especially at 15 years old. We expect reasonable boundaries with most people, such as respecting our privacy and sense of self, and not to harm us, physically or mentally. What you've done would be considered sexual harassment."
