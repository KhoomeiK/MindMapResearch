thesims,fmpi5yd,t3_fwfchm,1586281266.0,"my sim was studying comedy for his last uni exam and I didn’t notice that he was very playful. I kept studying the comedy skill, until the stupid idiot got hysterical and died. in front of his alien babies. the worst death ever. luckily he was a part of my super sim family, and his wife made ambrosia (no cheats) to resurrect him. 

RIP dani wish u were here"

depression,f1g3ur5,t1_f1g34d2,1569459329.0,"thanks for your reply but i simply just meant i don’t have a good level of seretonin, I need to take medicine so my brain can be “ok” and to not self destruct. I know no one is truly happy but I have a friend that’s never thought of suicide. as someone that contemplates it everyday, it sucks to know I will never not want to kill myself"
depression,f1fzt6b,t3_d98nwd,1569456714.0,one time I isolated myself and I heard all my friends laughing and having a great time and I convinced myself it was because I wasn’t there. and I thought to myself I will never have what they have
