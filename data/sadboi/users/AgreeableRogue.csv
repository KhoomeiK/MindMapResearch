We split up to cover more ground and my older, male partner saw a youngish women walking, went up to her with a lead in his hand asking her if he'd seen his puppy. When he realised he'd scared her a bit he was mortified and tried to leave - but she was following the same track so she was just a little way behind him. By the time he'd found me and the puppy he was horrified and didn't know what to do! That poor woman 😳"

infj,f7knqjt,t3_dwgnrj,1573819696.0,"I find that a lot of the advice my sports-crazed parents gave my INFJ self missed the mark, but here's something my pa said to explain how he could concentrate on batting that continues to help me. He said that concentrating on the one thing for long periods of time can become its own stress and when he needed to refresh, he looked towards the pavilion to see what was going on there. He said having a focused point of concentration that is something and somewhere else helps him to return refreshed and renewed to the task at hand. I'm post-grad at the moment and most of my colleagues use some form of this technique. For example, when I am working towards an academic goal, I usually have a sideline learning task like learning how to make cheese. Spoiler alert: with homemade cheese, a little ingenuity, and a small outlay it takes about three hours to make a cheese on par with store bought cheese but you save 50 cents per product unit."
