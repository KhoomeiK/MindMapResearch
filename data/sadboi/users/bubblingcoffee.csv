I was in a similar experience, but it happened while I was in college, so I was about 22 when I breathed that first sigh of relief when I realized I was in control.  I realized no one else new better than me about what was good for me.  I took control in that moment and began drafting a plan for what I was going to do.  I stopped doing things only for the mere approval of others.  Caution: do not come off as rude because of this.  It gets very easy to just say fuck off to everyone but that is not the solution.

Create plans within yourself.  Think what you want to do, for me it was the military.  I always wanted it, but never took action.  But one day I just laid the cards out to my family and girlfriend that I was definitely going in.  (I leave next month).  That provided me with a sense of control, and the fog that surrounded be began to lift.

I would make a few rules for yourself on your journey to find yourself.

1.Always be in control of your emotions.  Avoid lashing out at people when they disagree, because they will.  Take their considerations and just put it in a folder in your mind, but act off of what you genuinely want to do.

2.Ask yourself what you want to do.  Don't ask what you think others will want to hear.  Imagine it completely, and know that if you change your mind that it is okay.

3. I don't know your family, but try to show love to them if you can.  And being calm around them will get them off your back.  I used to say this, ""I hear and understand what you're saying"" to whoever I felt was judging me or being harsh towards me when I was doing my best.

4. For high school, just do your best and don't worry about the grade.  Just get through.  Try to enjoy it a little if you can.  Personally most of high school for me was just nonsense.  I learned the most experience from wanting to be a competent individual.  Find books and ideas you're interested in, and pursue them.  All you need to do is to learn how to think.

&#x200B;

My final statement: Write/type out what you want and how you intend to get there.  That is all you need to do.  And it is OKAY if you decide to change it.  Seek out a mentor who is not a family member, that helped me big time.

Good luck out there kid, you'll make it through.  I am still searching for the light myself, but I can see it sometimes.  It is getting brighter."
depression,f1wd793,t1_f1v5sma,1569783281.0,"I like your thoughts on pop culture.  This is obviously not my original statement, but happiness is fleeting, pleasure is not lasting, nor does it satisfy unless it is earned.  Human beings should try to seek fulfillment, and meaning in life.  Maybe it is not that life is innately horrible, but humans make it **worse** than it has to be.  

I encourage you to take a look at ""Tribe"" by Sebastian Junger.  I have recently ordered and have not read it yet, however it was covered on the JRE podcast.  The important information from the book is that people in the 21st century in the first world are more depressed, and have more mental problems, than the whole rest of the world.  Junger also states that society doesn't have to be this way, or at least wasn't always this way, when he compares our society to the society of the Native Americans pre-colonization.

Essentially, now, we feel alone in a crowed.  This has never happened before, we used to live in tribes (like native american tribes) to survive, otherwise we would die.  The result of living in a tribe is that we were essential to the group.  We aided the group's survival.  At our workplace today, we are in individual competitions to get ourselves to the top. (I work for the National Park Service). 

The solution:  Well where exactly *can* we go from here?  The whole earth is owned by one government or another.  There is no way to break out of society and start a new one.  This is perhaps a feeling that makes me feel more trapped than the thought of death.

Better solution: we organize and **make** this breakaway society."

Personally speaking, I try to mentally, spiritually, and physically strong enough to withstand the hardships that life brings.  This makes life a little easier knowing that you can get up after each one.  And as for questioning, well shoot friend, we can question and debate all we want.  A good thing in my opinion."

Do we get judged at the end of it all?  Maybe.  Many other ancient religions that predate christianity depict a similar judgement.  But I don't think I would live my life differently if there isn't a judgment either.  I'd still want to try to search for mystery, meaning, and fulfillment."

\-It doesn't help to go back and try to re-live the things you used to do because you're trying to experience them again for the first time and you just can't.

\-When you were in the golden years you were totally in the moment.  In the present.  Constantly remembering how things used to be fractures your ""soul"", or mind or whatever you can use to identify that part of ourselves.  Part of you is in the past trying to recapture what is gone, like a ghost going through the past.  You can watch, but you cannot participate.  The rest of you is worrying in the present about making the future better.  If that doesn't cause anxiety I do not know what does lol.

Some hope for ourselves:

\-Being unhappy, finding that you're not enjoying ""play"" like we used to are indications that something is wrong.  Personally I feel like we need to take our time back from things like social media, unnecessary obligations (define them to yourself, places you dread going to, perhaps).

I used to seek constant approval from others, which made me feel lost because I was only doing things that other people approved of.  We may need to have some uncomfortable conversations to shake these chains off ourselves to get back into the moment.  The past is gone, but maybe we can play again like we did when we were children if we try."
depression,f1ubb7l,t3_darfyw,1569756870.0,"This is such a coincidence because I was telling my friend the other day how it feels like the rapture came and we are all stuck in hell.  The reason why no one knows that we are in hell is because we aren't missing the people who were sent up to heaven because they lived very quiet lives and we probably never associated with them.  A monk for example.

For me, this feels like hell because I feel like I am living a life without any meaning.  I am 24 y/o male.  Just don't feel like doing anything because there is nothing to do.  The number 1 thing I want to do is to run away into isolation like in the mountains somewhere.  Society is too much for me and I can't take it anymore.  I overhear conversations about people's priorities and it is the usual crap.  Endless errands.  Endless celebrations, like birthday's, anniversaries, empty things in my opinion.  I can't get myself to care about those celebrations, nor things like sports, or even going out to the club or bar.  I refuse to go out and pay ten-fold for some cheap alcohol.  There is no where for me to run on this earth that isn't already owned by some government.  I can't start a new life, a new culture, or society because there is no more space in the play-pen.  Maybe I would just die along the way, but I would feel free.  I would have some time that wasn't squeezed by the clock.

I am trapped between the clock.  Between shifts at work I can breathe for a few hours but then it is back to the grind.  I am working a 52 hour week right now, which ends in October, where I will be back to having a part time job at my college.  What end do I work toward?  I can't find romance in my life, I can't find spirituality, I have looked for God but he seems to vanish or not be there.  Sometimes I think God doesn't intervene at all, except to punish when I don't believe. Often I wish to just fade away, into the sunset.  Whatever that is supposed to symbolize.

When I was a child the colors, smells, and sounds, were just so much more ***crisp***.  Autumn had a scent, and a feel.  My first high school loves seemed to be in the autumn because that is when I would meet new girls.  The music was meaningful and propelled me on my quest for women.  I don't want to seem like a pig, I didn't just want to have sex with them.  I enjoyed the company they offered, and tried to be a good man to them, even in my teenage years.  I have a girlfriend now, and have looked for other women, not attracted to any of them more than the one I have now.  But not attracted to any woman really.  It is like there is a shade of gray pasted over my whole life.  Numbing things down just a little bit.  The days blur into weeks.  I don't know what happened to the 22nd year of my life.  Just can't recall it for whatever reason.  What am I to do ?  Well I seek the abandonment of my current life and routines.  I have recently accepted an offer to attend Naval Officer Candidate School, to later become a Surface Warfare Officer.  I hope this provides some meaning.  The only thing I have ever wanted in my life is this.  Like since I was 8 years old.

Okay I think I am done venting now.. thanks."

Still though I get nostalgic about AC2 and 3.  I really liked them because of their simplicity, plane color schemes, and above all the soundtrack of AC2.  Really would wish a retro ace combat was released with elements of PVP, PVE, fantasy, and a level editor so the AC community can make it's own maps.

I dont know if you're familiar with tomb raider, but theres a level editor which allows for just that.  Greatly extended the life of games that were made in 1995.  Otherwise we have to wait for the developers to put out content."

I strongly disagree that this speech was genuine concern for the environment.  I believe it was an act to appear concerned in order to gain publicity for herself.  Not publicity for the cause of saving the environment.  I think this because she fails to call out the greatest polluters of the world, which are India, Sri Lanka, and China.

Further more, Greta's speech was generic, and I quote: “You come to us young people for hope - how dare you?” she said.
- What does that mean?  ""Young people"" are of no utility until the bring some new idea to the table.  The main aspect of her speech was doing whatever necessary to lower CO2 emissions.  As if she has understood all the literature related to climate change at the age of 16.  Meanwhile the whole notion that humans are responsible for climate change is still unclear.

“You have stolen my dreams, my childhood, with your empty words.""
- What does this sentence even mean?  What have we stolen from her?

“People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing, we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and the fairy tale of endless economic growth. How dare you?

- People's standard of living are increasing
- Less people are dying due to illness and starvation than ever before
- What ecosystem exactly is collapsing?  The world?
- Nothing suggests a mass extinction is imminent
- Economic growth is always good

Her parents, Malena Ernman and Svante Thunberg, are Swedish activists and also actors.  They brainwashed Greta through terror, making her believe the world is about to come to a fiery end.  Borderline child abuse perhaps.  This is a simple publicity stunt to make people (the audience) act on emotion as opposed to reason.  Her parents pulled this stunt to make Greta's appearance valuable, demanded, so that they can charge money for her to show up and speak at events.  Making her an icon.  This all translates into cash.  Non of which will help the environment.  Nor will her veganism, which I am sure then intend to push on all of what remains of the free world.  I am on a strict carnivore diet for health and do not want to participate in anything that resembles a meat tax, but nonetheless I digress.

Now let me say, I want a clean environment.  I demand we stop those who are destroying it, namely: China, India, Sri Lanka, poachers in Africa, to name a few.  These countries/peoples blatantly pollute the environment and will hunt animals into extinction.  But did she name these countries in her complaint to the UN?  No she did not.  Very suspicious if you ask me.  I think that the reason is because her parents are aware she will have NO AUDIENCE with the Chinese government, nor the Indian.  The west is simply the only society who hate themselves enough to pander to such garbage.  Not me, and I intend to fight climate fascists, and their icons like Greta all the way.
