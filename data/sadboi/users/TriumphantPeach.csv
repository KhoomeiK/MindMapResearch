All the money in the world wouldn't be enough for me to move back. I joke with my bf about burning the whole state down all the time. He loved it there (isnt from there and only lived there for 3 years) and would love to move back when were older but I tell him hes SOL. He visits 1-3 times a year to see his friends but I've been back 1 time since moving. 

I went back this year for my siblings birthdays and I didnt realize how bad just being in Idaho effects my mental state. Like you said I get moody and triggered by all the bad memories.

And at the time I left I was pretty much their sole caretaker. I honestly hate that I left them but if I stayed I 100% would have ended up taking my own life and that would be far worse for them. I can at least help them navigate how to deal with my parents even tho I live so far. I do feel bad about my mom sometimes but I have to remind myself that my entire life she chose EVIL men over her own 4 children. Should she ever decide to leave my stepdad (the true problem) I am 100% there for her. But she wont. Even after he threatened to shoot himself in front of the kids she wont. And she continues to put my siblings through hell so as far as I'm concerned she has made her bed. 

But because of them I feel extreme guilt over others all the time. The amount of times the word ""sorry"" comes out of my mouth a day is pretty depressing. Guilt is compulsive for me at this point."

God the stories I could tell about my parents. Is there a forum for just that lolol. 

Because of that I think that no matter what I say people aren't going to believe it. If someone doesn't have the ""proper"" reaction to what I say I start second guessing myself and wondering if what I said could be a lie intentional or not. And when I do talk about myself it feels wrong or like I'm self centered because i was always told i was selfish as well

I am at the point where I literally do not care to get better or be happy or change my life ""for the better"" I'm just done and have accepted that things are the way they are.

AskReddit,f7jlzub,t3_dw84zi,1573780652.0,"Sorry for the length. 2 years ago my bf and I were out buying weed. It was a slightly rainy day and we had a 2 door Ford explorer(explorers are already top heavy not to mention it only had 2 doors). When we were exiting our neighborhood the tires skid a bit before gaining traction. No biggie just have to be more careful. Later on we were merging onto the interstate and this particular ramp had a long tight curve that turned into a bridge. I remember looking at his speed and he was going between 25-30. Any slower and people would have been honking. Right as we came around the end of the curve (I'm assuming, still don't know) the tire on the drivers side skid on some gravel and then blew out causing the car to pull waaay to the left. My bf tried to straighten out and he overcorrected and sent us head on into a giant cement median. It was either that or over the edge of the bridge on the other side. After we hit the median our car rolled 4 times according to the person behind us. Who just so happened to be an off duty EMT. This was also at 5 o'clock traffic and Iive in a huge city. Somehow there was no one near us so we didnt get hit. We also had time to get the-crap load-of weed we had on us out of the car before the cops got there and gave it to my bfs mom who put it in her car because she was there at that point. I had a cut on my collarbone and he had a cut on his hand and a bruise on shin. Miracle. We rolled on his side and it was completely crushed. And both of our new phones and my glasses were thrown out of the car and none of it was broken or scratched at all. So to list the miracles 1. We didnt get caught with weed 2. We made it out almost unscathed 3. We didnt get hit by another car 4. We didnt go off the bridge and we would have definitely died 5. The person behind us was an emt. 6. Only the car was damaged nothing else. We should have died that day tbh. I'm not religious but something had our backs that day. I've never been more terrified in a time span of 2 minutes. Writing this took me hours because I have a hard time thinking about it"
