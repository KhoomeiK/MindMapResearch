Are you guys splitting utilities too? If I were staying with 4 people, I’d want cheaper rent because that means less room in the fridge for my things, less washer and dryer availability and overall a more noisy household. It better be cheaper if I’m putting up with more."

Most laws were originally put in place to keep women from getting fucked in a man dominated world. I think there are laws that are now outdated because our world has now shifted, and gender roles aren't what they used to be.   


And to be honest, this sub isn't accomplishing anything. Everything that could be established and changed through discourse gets drowned in the cum buckets everyone circle jerks into, because you're all too busy patting each other on the back for ""pwning them weak wominz"". You're right though, this sub has devolved into trashy fight videos (with very little context)."
pussypassdenied,fp0scad,t1_fozzmy1,1588215836.0,"So from what I can gather, feminism is bad because you only base your view of it off of these radical feminists? You do realize that there are radicals in any group. Be it Christians, feminists or Star Wars fans, once someone becomes a radical (like the person who made the comment), they are no longer really part of that base group. They’ve separated into a whole other group. 

I don’t get what dumb posts like this have to do with anything in this sub. 

I joined because I thought there’d be honest dialogue about actual men’s problems, like custody battles in court for example. Actual feminists want equality, and you equating us with these radical feminists who blow things out of proportion and happen to yell the loudest doesn’t actually help anything, let alone men."

depression,fhfktvt,t3_f2qwaw,1581545431.0,"I totally get you dude. I was the same way 3 years ago. My depression was so bad I felt like a single thought or task took so much energy and effort. It wasn’t even just a foggy unfocused brain, it was like wading through a river of molasses to recall certain things. I’d beat myself up over stupid social mistakes and things I could be doing atm. It took me a couple of years to drag myself out of that hole

What I found really helpful was being mindful of self-bullying. Being kind to yourself can go a long way. It’s not just thinking positive thoughts, it’s being accepting of the negatives too. 
Try to catch those intrusive  thoughts and say Fuck You, I’m going to either not care so much about this, or choose to forgive myself for this small fuck up. Small daily thoughts of forgiveness. 

There’s this mindfulness trick where you imagine your emotions and intrusive thoughts are a river in the woods, you see and acknowledge them, but you don’t have to engage with them. That helped me realize that my emotions shouldn’t have control of my brain. 

This is cheesy, but looking at the stars also reminds me that I am small and my actions are inconsequential, because in the grand scheme of the universe it doesn’t matter if I misspoke a couple of times. It’s okay to be “useless” sometimes because hey, I’m the one who has to live with myself, society doesn’t get to judge me for how I spend my time on this earth. 

If someone is going to be shitty and unforgiving about you not remembering a word, or saying the wrong thing, like life is a series of video game character dialogues, then I no longer care about their opinion as a human. I can’t stand intolerance of that nature. 

Try to get to the root of why you rag on yourself so harshly, and try to shift how you think about things. 

For example, I realized that I used to put people on pedestals as if they were better than me. People who were better at talking, or had a quicker wit. it caused me to hate myself for not being like them. I started by focusing on their faults, and that leveled everyone out. Even if that guy is smarter than me, he has a borderline racist mentality, so it doesn’t really matter. I retrained my thought pattern so I wasn’t just constantly shitting on myself. Everything in life is chaos, so why should I aim for perfection? I’ve found that the right people appreciate those who are genuine. If I can’t remember a word or my brain is being slow, I say “sorry, I just completely lost my train of thought, blahh” and laugh it off. If someone bases your entire human capability off of one interaction, than they’re petty. 

I also found that having a purpose helped a lot. Mine is really small, but my goal in life is to make sure everyone around me doesn’t feel worthless or unheard like I did during my depression. During group social settings I make sure no ones standing behind me or left out. If someone’s trying to say something and no ones listening, I look them in the eyes and make sure they’re heard. That gives me something to cling to, and makes me feel good about myself hah. It’s the little daily things that help my depression from returning. 

Sorry for the rambling rant, please try to forgive yourself. And you’re not worthless. It’s your life, take your time"

I swear this comment section is just a pit of smug, insecure, vengeful assholes, just waiting for their next feeding of “HaHa StOoPiD FeM gEt’S lEaRnT”. It’s heartless and lazy. And I only hope that their mistakes aren’t met with the same ridiculous, savage animosity that they treat some of these people with.

I joined this sub because I seriously thought it’d broaden my views on true equality in feminism. Men do deserve a voice to discuss the ways they’ve felt that women have had the upper hand, such as child support and family court. And in the beginning this sub was about social flaws in this country that allow the worst of us women to slip through the cracks and abuse men. 
But this has quickly turned from a civil discussion to a barbaric show of incels throwing their shit at the smallest fuck ups a person can do. 
It’s not even a discussion anymore."

There are a few groups on Facebook that are effective in African and Vietnamese pangolin conservation, and other endangered animals. I’ll link the ones I’ve found so far so people can donate if they’re feeling it. 

Even just going to Facebook and liking their pages spreads awareness. The last one is a badass group of women called the Akashinga who actively arrest poachers and spread awareness in their communities.
