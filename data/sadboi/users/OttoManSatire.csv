Some of the fighters have generational legacies that they need to stick to so all of that is incorporated into new ideas.

The bones of the ring were handed by the ref (they bald one). He had worked in the WWE. He made sure the ropes were correctly taut and that the ring had the right give. We had dudes falling 2 stories sometimes. All the other day-to-day was me and my counterpart. 

I got to know every inch of that ring. I took pride in it. This may sound weird but I had an emotional connection with it. Like a deer head with his hot rod or  a farmer with his tractor. I realize this when I walked in one day and it was completely stripped down because we were replacing the boards. And it felt like walking in on you're passed out, disheveled female friend.

It's absolutely terrible.

It actually genuinely bothered me. I saw a lot of opportunities where they could have made a decent profit. We threw away most of the trashed mats and all of broken tables & bent up chairs. I repeatedly told production to put those in the merch shop (or just set them up next to the line where the audience has to wait with price tags on them.) They just didn't care. I promised them that they could easily sell a bloodied, torn, used mat for a couple grand. And just imagine how much are value would be added if it was signed. 

We could have made 5-10× the cost on chairs and tables. I felt like I was throwing away cash money when I tossed broken tables and chairs into the dumpster.

I, to this day, still have no idea how to get a ticket to be an audience member. They are really lacking in the connection between the actual people and the entertainment. But I assume they're happy with what they're raking in so my suggestions fell upon deaf ears.
