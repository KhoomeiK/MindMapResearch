relationship_advice,fgf3ux3,t3_ey4ois,1580722958.0,"All that you can do is ensure her that you’re there for her. If she starts getting “those” thoughts in her head let her know that you’re there for her, we other it’s as simple as a check in text or a FaceTime. Self harming isn’t something that you can be told to fix, it’s a battle going on within the person. Let her know how much they mean to you and if there’s anything that you can help/give your thoughts on with her situation (whatever may be the cause of it)."

dating_advice,fg0ogs8,t3_ewaf5s,1580411911.0,"Talking to women is all about self confidence. Find ways to establish your style. Don’t be pressured to jump into a relationship just because it’s what you see going on around you. Take care of yourself and the girls will come later down the line, but don’t be afraid to talk to them and just be a nice guy to them."
