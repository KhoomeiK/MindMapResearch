bipolar2,fr37e10,t1_fr350qy,1589851441.0,"Well I always thought that I had PTSD because of child abuse and neglect, but when reading over the symptoms, I did not really relate to it. So then I came across C-PTSD, which described my long term traumas. I brought it to my psychiatrist’s attention that I did the research and that the symptoms made more sense; she agreed. I wondered during my sessions why we talked more about my traumas than bipolar episodes."

bipolar2,fr2zp9b,t1_fr2ysc6,1589847034.0,Complex-Post Traumatic Stress Disorder: It is complex because it is traumatic events that happen over a long period of time compared to PTSD where it is one singular event. This can refer to child abuse and neglect ( what I’ve been through). So there are additional symptoms that PTSD doesn’t have. It is not an official diagnosis in the DSM-5 or ICD(yet). There’s also r/CPTSD that has tons of info.

bipolar2,fr1hqib,t1_fr1h0vw,1589819936.0,"Treatment will remain the same. I take lithium and I can still take it to help control mood swings and suicidal thoughts. I’ve always thought I’ve had PTSD but I recently discovered more about C-PTSD and the symptoms made more sense. I brought it up to my psychiatrist and she agreed that bipolar disorder wasn’t the correct diagnosis( Idk why she waited until now to tell me), but most of the things we talked about was my trauma rather than episodes. Thank you for your kind words!

When someone speaks out about not liking their mother, they are usually met with “honor thy mother”  and “how could you say that, she’s your mother” She’s reaching out to her fans saying that it is okay to not celebrate Mother’s Day like most do, and to find unconditional love in other people. It is sad because Lana doesn’t have that kind of relationship with her mom, like many of her fans( me included). Lana is expressing something personal about her life that she otherwise wouldn’t share. If you find that cringe worthy, fine, you’re just not the audience she is speaking to."

We don’t know the whole story and she shouldn’t be criticized for not including her mom, she could have done it in a different way that is appropriate for their relationship.

AskReddit,fptbybr,t3_gfbj2j,1588888465.0,"When I was a senior in high school I started seeing this guy. He seemed super chill and one day he decided to message me on fb. We hit it off and so we started to hang out. On our first “date” he took me to the movies and it was a good time, and I believed that a relationship would come out of this. I was wrong. Pretty much every time we hung out he wanted oral sex or to do something sexual. At first I was okay with it because I thought I had to do it in order for him to like me. And once we were done, it was almost as if he wanted nothing to do with me. So this went on pretty much all of senior year until I broke it off with him bc he was going to a different college. Over the summer I found out he was going to the same one as me. I still had feelings for him so I was hoping we would reconnect. We hung out and it was the same old thing, and then this one time was the last. We went for a car ride and did the usual thing, but the whole time I just felt used. I was angry. I told him I wanted him to stop and take me back to campus. I explained that I’ve always felt like I was being led on thinking there would be something more. He told me he wasn’t ready for a relationship, I knew that was bull. I told him that he never really cared, got out of the car and walked back to my room. I’m so glad I realized my self worth and that I was being disrespected. Since then I didn’t put up with that again."
