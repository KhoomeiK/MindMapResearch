StrangerThings,fcsb29d,t3_eijzgh,1577914041.0,I feel like I've seen somewhere that Erica wasn't supposed to have such a big role as she has done. Apparently the writers loved the actress so much they decided to write her more lines and get her more involved.
CasualConversation,f1fd0en,t3_d8zq07,1569441824.0,"You've done an amazing job!! When I struggle with motivation I write a ""tadaa"" list - it's an idea I found on Instagram. Instead of writing a to do list, you write down everything you achieved that day and call it a tadaa list. It's really helped me because I can look back and say to myself ""you are awesome, look at all you can achieve in a day""."

askwomenadvice,eytc1o8,t1_eysxga9,1567432338.0,"I back this!! I know this is the decision you made and great! My bf is totally fine with me making friends with guys as I am with him making friends with girls, it's no big deal at all but I know that in this situation her SO will really appreciate the invite whether they come or not. Plus, there's every chance you'll get on with her SO too and that's more friends! 

I hope it all goes well!"
