About a year ago, though, I noticed I was particularly dreading going back to work after returning from a week-long trip. I came to realize it was because I hated my workplace. I'm in a new workplace now and I adore my coworkers, get along really well with my boss and have a lot of benefits I didn't before.

CasualConversation,etqgljy,t1_etqekhq,1563084171.0,">I guess what I'm really saying is, explore the more populated areas of the city. It often has more to explore, you often stand out less, and sometimes, the maintenance door to the roof is left unlocked.

I've discovered this recently! I moved from a small city to a large city (roughly double the population) and had a bit of trouble adjusting to a busier environment. I have social anxiety, so I had it in my head that everyone was staring at me. When I felt particularly paranoid, I would try and see if I could ""catch"" someone staring at me, but it rarely happened. It made me remember a lot of the advice I would get from other people about dealing with a fear of crowds amounted to: ""You need to realize that most people aren't paying attention."" I would just brush it off because I interpreted it in a ""thanks, I'm cured"" sort of way.

&#x200B;

But nah, dude, it turns out I should have interpreted it in a ""You \*need\* to realize that most people aren't paying attention."" Shortly after it clicked in my head, I started feeling really at-ease in crowds. I wouldn't say that I'm ""cured"", but I have noticed my symptoms have been a lot milder."
CasualConversation,etn3phk,t3_ccia7w,1562975866.0,"1. I drink socially, but I use pot daily. I've always preferred the way being high makes me feel versus the way being drunk makes me feel. I stopped smoking pot for several years after college because I fell out of touch with the people I used to get it from. Social awkwardness prevented me from just finding a new dealer. But now, since I'm Canadian, I'm lucky enough to live in a place where it's been legalized!
2. I don't have any physical illnesses (I'm overweight, though), but I've been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and depression. I've been taking medication for it for about 4 years now, but it's only recently that my doctors and I have been able to find a combination of medicines that work for me. Being able to easily access weed has also been a huge help!

4. I work at a mobile game studio, specifically as a Game Designer. My days mostly involves editing spreadsheets, lol.
5. My biggest physical insecurity is definitely my weight! Food has always been my coping mechanism for dealing with my mental illnesses. I go through cycles of binging and restricting calories, with the occasional period of normalcy. My biggest insecurity mentally/emotionally is my fear that I'll never be able to look exactly how I want to. I have an image of what my ""perfect self"" looks like, but I know it's something I don't have that level of control over. Sometimes it makes me feel like giving up, but I have a very loving husband who keeps me grounded. :)"
