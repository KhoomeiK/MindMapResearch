But I'm invested now so I'm going to counter with 2 things. One, tax payers funding a public university loan is not equivalent to pushing it onto the students. That would be like taking the cost of a new park out of the parks and rec employee salaries. Two, we are both making big assumptions that they did take out a loan. If they did, isnt it reasonable to expect them plan ahead for loss of revenue, they bleed the general fund you spoke about. What is there for if not for unexpected situations. Its exactly the lecture every person had received in one form or another; you should have a savings for emergency. Homeowners taking out a loan cannot count on being able to pay mortgage based on their monthly (or semester) income for the entire duration of the loan. You have the insight that you dont know the future and therefore prepare. Its on the governing body to prepare, not the students to bail them out. As I write this I am aware we are just in a microcosm, having a proxy argument based on the same principles of who fits the bill when shit hits the fan. The only answer for the entirety of civilization is the people who govern over the population. The chief, the elders, the king, the queen, the parliament, the congress. When we surrender control, whoever undertook it is directly responsible. I dont know what horse you have in the 45$-fitness-fee-for-the-mortgage-loan-race, but its silly to defend a group of people who principally failed you."
unr,fp3dz6v,t1_fp0ynwk,1588277646.0,Its not on the students to absorb cost of negligence. In the case we are obliged to pay their loan then we should own portions of the building. That's stupid you say? Its just as stupid as a homeowner who rents out an empty house yet demands money from the people who moved out for the mortgage. You take out a loan to build a building you dont get to stop paying the loan just because your income isnt flowing anymore. Its incredibly immoral to charge people a service they legally can't use. Its just as silly as paying a grocery store who doesnt let you keep the food.
