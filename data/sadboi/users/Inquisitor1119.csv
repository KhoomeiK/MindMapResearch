OnceUponATime,fr2rc45,t1_fr2ei48,1589842413.0,"I appreciate the compliment!  To be fair, anybody who's actually sat down and thought about who Belle is could have done it better.  She is kind, patient, brave, self-sacrificing, and tactile.  She's equal parts romantic and practical.  She can see past one man's beauty to the ugliness within, and past another man's ugliness to the beauty within.  Of all the Disney princesses I watched growing up, she was the one I aspired to be (and not because of our mutual love of books).  But the Once showrunners didn't take any of the above into account.  She never truly gets her own arc - she's mostly used as a plot device.  Her entire involvement of the story is to play on Rumple's weaknesses (either through relationship issues, being kidnapped/threatened, or being used as blackmail against him), or as a convenient ""oh, there's something you don't know?  I read a book about that once"" info dump.  And on that note can I just say that movie Belle read FICTION?  She read stories of heroism, and we never see her reading up on history or anything else ""real.""

What you said about caring more about Rumple than Belle, that's pretty much exactly how I feel - I wanted Rumple to get his happy ending, and if it had to be with Belle, so be it.  Of course, I'm not completely absolving him, either - they had him constantly backsliding and making the same mistakes over and over again.  Like that whole ""wanting to have it all"" bit he struggles with?  He literally lectures Regina about that in season 2 - how wanting it all will leave you with nothing.  I thought that Skin Deep Belle and Rumple were a great starting point.  There were enough differences and flaws in both that could allow them to develop together.  But characters are supposed to GROW over the course of the story, and those two just kept doubling down on their flaws.  Their ""happy beginning"" felt completely unearned because they very quickly went from practically hating each other to settling into domestic bliss.  

I ship the hell out of the two in AUs, because fan fiction writers do a better job of writing the characters than the actual showrunners did."

Benevolent, powerful, ancient being.  But then why is the Enchanted Forest such a mess?  Sure, some of it is the Dark One's fault, but a lot of it isn't.  Why have ogres been allowed to *repeatedly* ravage the land and kill people?  Why was Princess Abigail's true love left in gold form?  How are there so many powerful, evil people left pretty much completely unchecked?  How is she able to bring a lifeless puppet to life AND turn him into a real boy, but she can't do the same for Gepetto's cursed parents?  When people talk about her, they make her out to be this incredibly powerful being, but any time we see her actually grant a wish, there's usually a reason why she can't give the requester exactly what they want.  So is it that she can't, or she won't?  Either way, if she were as powerful and benevolent as they make her out to be, nobody would be calling on Rumplestiltskin for help.

I have so many questions.  Why is she called THE Reul Ghorm?  Is it her name, or is it a title similar to Dark One?  Was she human once, like Fiona?  Why didn't she strip Fiona of her fairyhood before banishing her (since we've seen her strip Tinker Bell of hers)?  On that note, why wasn't Tiger Lily there to give Rumple a halfway decent childhood, Cosmo and Wanda-style?  Why did she never seem to really try to stop the Dark One?

1.) He tries to take the hat before the duke gets the dagger.  This would indicate to me that he's looking to be free of the Dark One altogether, to try to live a normal life.  Once the duke got the dagger, he lost the ability to kill himself, so he found Rumple.

2.) The duke gets possession of the dagger, prompting Zoso to search for the hat when not otherwise occupied.  This might have been Zoso's last-ditch effort to break the dagger's thrall; when he failed, he searched for a soul desperate enough to kill him outright."
OnceUponATime,fqj5n13,t1_fqdi2ux,1589405374.0,"I'm just gonna say I love you because you actually interpreted movie Belle correctly.  I loathe when people say ""hur hur Beauty and the Beast was about Stockholm Syndrome.""  Um... no?  She didn't even *like* the Beast when he was being cruel.  She didn't fall in love with him just because he fed some birds and gave her access to a library.  She spent time with him, read with him, taught him compassion, and had an amazing date night with him, and she still couldn't love him because of the power imbalance of her being his prisoner.  She couldn't love him until he let her go, and she still didn't realize it until she saw him show mercy to a man who was trying to kill him.  In a case like that, it makes sense that movie Belle would want her beast to be good, because that's the man she ultimately fell in love with.

Show Belle doesn't do that.  She falls in love with him while he's still making deals and killing/torturing people.  She falls in love with him *because* he's the Dark One (otherwise he would have died before she was born).  It made no sense for the writers to make her this unyieldingly pure hero character who demands the same of her lover when *that's not the man she fell in love with.*  It was like the writers just wanted to add needless drama in the relationship, so they just made the two constantly at odds with each other.  If they really wanted the drama, y'know what would have been a much more interesting twist?  If Belle secretly loved Rumple's dark side the way Lacey did, and found her own morals entering a more gray area the more time she spent with him.  Imagine the Catch-22: Rumple needs Belle's goodness to help him do the right thing, but the longer she stays with him the darker she gets, until eventually that good influence is gone.  Belle wants to help him be the man instead of the monster, but finds that she has demons of her own.

There's also a fundamental flaw in Skin Deep (which wouldn't have been a flaw with the proper follow-up).  In the movie, Belle doesn't realize that the Beast is a cursed prince.  She sees a torn portrait, but doesn't put two and two together.  So when she confesses her love, she accepts him as he currently is.  With show Belle, she's told flat-out that Rumple is cursed, and that changes things.  Now when she kisses him, it's with the expectation that he's going to change for her.  This could have been really interesting if they'd chased this lead with Rumple telling her that she'd been trying to change him from their very first kiss, but that never happens.  They just kind of ignore her tainted motives in favor of saying, ""Rumple bad, Belle good.""

Also, side note about the Beauty and the Beast movie: even that version of Belle was able to meet the Beast halfway.  When his impatience scared away the birds, she didn't yell at him for it and give up on him; she helped show him how to do it by showing her own patience.  When he ate like a goddamn slob, he saw her disapproval and tried to change by using a spoon, which he was physically incapable of using.  She came up with the idea of sipping directly from their bowls so that he could eat comfortably without grossing her out.

Anyway, sorry about the rant.  Beauty and the Beast, in all of its variations and adaptations, is my favorite story of all time.  It really flies up my butt sideways that they set up a story with so much potential for character growth on a sliding scale of morality, only to reduce the characters to a lying villain and a sanctimonious harridan."

OnceUponATime,fppjqbz,t1_fpcyvrz,1588803549.0,"In Belle's (admittedly very lukewarm) defense, Rumpel really started their post-Dark Curse relationship off on the worst possible note.  He brings back magic and tells her it's because he wants power, when the last thing he'd ever said to her in the Dark Castle was that he loved his power more than her.  Then, he immediately breaks his promise not to try to off Regina.  Yes, *technically* he's not going to be the one to kill her, but he takes actions with the explicit purpose of causing Regina's death.  I'd be pretty wary of him using magic in those circumstances, too.   Plus the lying.

But yeah, that's all I've got for defense.  Even her early dream of Rumpel left a bad taste in my mouth.  Your biggest fear for your relationship is that your lover is going to be the exact person you fell in love with?  What the hell.  If you're in a relationship with someone, and their behavior is a deal-breaker, you really have two options: 1.) leave and find someone who's better suited to you, or 2.) if they express a willingness to change, stick around and *actually help them to change.*  

Rumpel's actions have a lot of parallels with drug addiction.  He hides his ""drug use,"" rationalizes why he needs it, compulsively seeks power even to the detriment of those he loves, and even when he ""gets clean,"" he relapses.  This is normal.  Sobriety is an ongoing struggle that often has a lot of false starts.  One of the worst things you can do for an addict is yell at them when they relapse and insist that they quit their addiction, right here and now.  But that's what Belle does all the time.  She chooses to live with an addict, and demands that he give up his drug of choice, but she doesn't do anything to encourage him to get clean, or address the underlying reasons for his obsession with power."

OnceUponATime,fphfuyv,t1_fph7jnp,1588620546.0,"I think it's a bit of both.  The best case I can make is by citing Skin Deep, because the deal he makes seems so out of character for him.  By the time Rumpelstiltzkin comes to Avonlea, his reputation precedes him; Maurice knows that he will demand a price, and offers gold up-front.  If it were the magic itself demanding a price, wouldn't Maurice wait for Rumpel to set the price?  When Rumpel demands Belle as payment, it isn't in the usual ""sacrifice of a virgin to appease magic/god/whatever.""  He takes her as a maid, which would be payment to him personally.  Belle even asks later why he demanded her as a price.  I think if the magic had demanded it, he would have hidden behind that instead of just saying the place was filthy. 

There are other cases where Rumpel wants something personal in exchange for something magical - for instance, when Victor wants his arm reattached, the price is just to admit that magic can do what science cannot.  That was Rumpel's vanity setting the price. 

I do believe that all magic has a price, but I don't think it works the way Rumpel would have us believe.  This price can come in many forms: time spent researching/perfecting a spell or potion, financial cost or danger of procuring rare spell components, and very possibly a physical cost to the caster as well.  Rumpel uses this to give himself an advantage when making his deals, so he can eventually get to the World Without Magic.  When he says, ""all magic has a price,"" he's saying, ""I'm not some wish-granting fairy.  If you want my help, you'd better make it worth my while."""

In the original movie/story, the Beauty didn’t fall in love with her Beast in hopes of him becoming a handsome prince.  She loved him even as a beast.  There was a huge missed opportunity where Belle’s light and Rumple’s darkness could have blended into gray, with each meeting the other in the middle.

You ""expect"" her to make dinner, you refuse to listen to her protests because your reasons are magically more logical than hers, and for some reason you make it sound like your half of the household income means more than hers, when it's *the same amount.*

You need to realize that while yes, she is fortunate enough to be able to work from home, she is still working.  Where do you expect this extra cooking time to come from?  Do you plan on letting her take less work while you cover more expenses?  Or do you expect her to sacrifice more of her own time, when she already works more hours AND spends more time on household upkeep?

If you're really that exhausted after work, come up with a different alternative.  Dump stuff in a crock pot in the morning so dinner will be ready when you get home.  Pick up some frozen pizzas and keep them on hand.  Have cereal or sandwiches for dinner a couple days a week."

Your partner is an adult.  As such, it is his responsibility to take care of himself so he doesn't reach that point.  Instead of depriving himself of the sleep he needed AND drinking, he should have skipped movie night in favor of getting rest.  I'm curious: does he do anything to actually treat his insomnia?  I go through cycles of insomnia, and there are all sorts of remedies/treatments he could try.

OnceUponATime,fmmchwb,t1_fmj64we,1586202807.0,"I agree with this 100%.  Season 2 set up Rumpel (I know I'm spelling it wrong but I prefer the traditional spelling of Rumpelstiltskin) and Belle to be a really intriguing couple who need to find compromise to make things work.  Rumpel starts opening up to Belle so she can understand him, and Belle starts accepting that the man she loves needs guidance and encouragement to do the right thing instead of the easy thing.  This could have led to some really compelling story arcs where they each struggle with the gray area of morality they've been forced into.  But then they were both shoehorned into this black vs. white mindset that just didn't work for the characters.  

The more I think about Belle being Rumpel's true love, the more frustrated I get with what they did with the characters.  Think about it: Belle was born decades (possibly over a century) after Rumpel.  If she was destined to be his true love, then it means she was destined to love him as the Dark One; otherwise, he would have died well before she was even born.  This implies that there needs to be compromise on both their parts.  A good personal like Belle would not have True Love with a purely dark being the way Cora could, so Rumpel would need to be halfway decent even with the curse riding him.  But since the Dark One's influence was necessary for them to meet in the first place, if she truly loved him then she would accept the darker aspects of his personality."

OnceUponATime,fm1l56r,t3_fshok9,1585680409.0,"I apologize in advance for climbing on my soap box.  I love all things Beauty and the Beast, and this is no exception - at least, at first.

I loved Seasons 1 and 2 of Belle and Rumpel.  There was so much potential there.  It seemed like they were setting things up where she would grow to accept the dark parts of his personality, as long as he would put in a sincere effort to be as good a man as he was able.  But that's not the direction they took.  The start of the problem is that they very suddenly went from utter rejection in Skin Deep, to ""I love yous"" in the season 1 finale, with no build-up in between.  Where are you supposed to go from there?  At first they used external obstacles that Belle and Rumpel had to work together to overcome - memory loss, physical separation, death.  But that gets old quickly.  So then they amped up the drama by making the obstacles to their relationship internal instead of external - lies, manipulation, an inability to be satisfied with what one has.  After a while, the relationship that I was most rooting for became the one that I wished would end already.

Another factor that they messed up is the relationship between Belle and her beast.  People like to say that Belle (in the original animated movie) has Stockholm Syndrome, which isn't true.  She doesn't shrink away from his temper or walk on eggshells to please him.  In fact, she doesn't even start to *like* her beast until he changes.  He controls his temper, shows a capacity for kindness and a willingness to learn, and she meets him halfway.  She doesn't truly fall in love with him until he shows mercy to a man who's literally trying to murder him.  

That... isn't how it went down in OUaT.  Belle fell in love with Rumpel while he was still killing, still making his deals, and making no effort to become a better man.  He treated her well when it suited him, and showed mercy to Robin because of his own hangups, but he never tried to improve.  From their very first kiss, she was trying to break his curse and change him, when that's not what he wanted.  There's a huge difference between movie!Belle falling in love with the man who became a better person for her, and show!Belle falling in love with the man she expected Rumpel to become.  There was manipulation on both sides - Belle never truly accepting Rumpel for what he is, and Rumpel deciding that his desires took precedence over Belle's."
