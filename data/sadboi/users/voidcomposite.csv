We had a session between students and the head to tell her why the teacher wasn't fit to teach English and math (for example she used my answers as the answer key so when I heard a different word because of her pronunciation, I was the only one who got it right. And in math different students have to try to correct her answers on the board when she's not in the room and spot where her mistakes were because we noticed that none of us got her answers.) Anyway nothing changed about her position but she became less megalomaniac and we got to have students leading our own homework grading sessions while she sat back and pretended not to exist.

Music from about 40 years ago are very beautifully written poetry, with very strict rhymes and alliterations, which is also common is prose and spoken. People used to be, still are on the level of informal communications, expressive through metaphors and alliterations. I say informal because its uses of homonyms (to me, better than puns) it requires a lot of wits and attitude, a different kind of wise. Old folk music are also poetry and very vivid. I am always surprised by them. 

More on the formal side, in Thai schools students learn Ramayana in a Thai version called Ramakien. And an original Thai one called ลิลิตพระลอ  among others. However I am more captivated by the performance form.

Anyway I just recently discovered something called Mo-lum and you can look into it. It's a genre of music but very versatile for use in performance and other sorts of art form. 30 years ago in the north east people would hold multi day theater show outdoor where ""Brechtian"" (of course they never heard of Brecht) poetry performance where prepared and improvised lines are performed. I could be wrong because they're often described as ""poetry dialogue"" which has the connotation similar to Multi-Person slam , which probably means they're allowed to prepared in some ways. They called it ""Voice of Isaan"". Because it was in dialect, most words were short, and Thai doesn't have grammar rules to stretch a sentence, so in each stanza it felt so packed. I'm pretty excited about it. I'll give you some links.

I'm sorry if this information is incorrect in anyway. I just discovered it recently. Being Thai I could only understand 80% of the dialect yet the sounds touch me deeply. And my apologies for sharing personal interests than a knowledgeable answer.
