mentalhealth,f9kpq7y,t3_e5kwgk,1575405385.0,"Yes, it's incredibly difficult and usually not a straight forward process but you can heal. I suffer from schizophrenia which has depressive states within itself, but my sister has MDD and I admire her strength and courage everyday.  

She found self reflection and journals to be incredible helpful, self care (mentally and psychically), eating healthy, spending enough time outdoors and working out, having an amazing support group and really challenging herself worked well. Medication was needed in the beginning and still needed from time to time (anxiety attacks and difficulty sleeping), but working through how to heal what's causing the depression was the real key! 

Reflection is where it all starts. Really sit with yourself and your thoughts will tell you a lot about who you are as a person. It's raw, you won't like somethings you see and some will make you happy.. but once you can understand who you are and where you're coming from, and what it is about yourself and life that's bringing you down...you won't fully understand who you are and where you need to be. 

Only you can change you.

For anyone fighting through this struggle, stay strong and KNOW that it WILL get better one day."
