The premise for that series is basically that the whole worlds population becomes unable to die, however their needs are still a thing for comfort as they can still feel pain, still get sick, and still get seriously injured. They just don‚Äôt die, they keep suffering. Eventually the government starts putting incurably sick and injured people into large furnaces to incinerate them because the hospitals are just full to the brim. Obviously it‚Äôs a sci-fi twist and is being caused by some weird technology because it‚Äôs Torchwood, but still I think it‚Äôs a really good take on how the world would react in that situation. If you don‚Äôt know what Torchwood is, it‚Äôs a spin off of doctor who about humans fighting alien technology."

He is such a wonderfully sweet guy and we had a pretty close relationship. We had a very open relationship too, sharing very personal and intimate things, but we always kept it very ‚Äúno hetero‚Äù. I developed a little crush on him after a while but never pursued anything because as I said, I thought he was into men. Anyway in a group call one day it comes out that he‚Äôs not gay and I was totally mind blown, which he found hilarious. A couple weeks later I was messaging him and he was out with some mates getting pretty drunk and he sent me a message along the lines of ‚Äúhey probably gonna regret this but do you wanna try being friends with benefits?‚Äù and I said ‚Äúfuck it why not‚Äù. So we planned it all out, I met up with him and we ended up taking each other‚Äôs first time. It didn‚Äôt take long after that before we both realised we wanted more than friends with benefits.

AskReddit,f4qd0e5,t3_dli226,1571751526.0,"I‚Äôll start! I‚Äôve had multiple piercings, eyebrow twice, lip twice, double lobes, and my nose. Despite getting my lobes pierced at Claire‚Äôs when I was 12/13, my story isn‚Äôt actually about my ears. I went to a mock up German Christmas market when I was 16 and had a really great time, if you‚Äôve never been to one I recommend it purely for the magical atmosphere. So I decided while we were in the city, I wanted to get my nose pierced. We found a little shop and firstly, I had never been to a piercing parlour before so I didn‚Äôt realise how sketchy this place looked. It was rough, like one room, dirty waiting area, it smelled like a vet surgery bleach mixed with wet dog, and the piercer had no sense of humour whatsoever when my mother joked about not giving me permission to get stabbed in the face.

I signed all the paperwork and handed over the ¬£20 then they took me into the piercing room which was shockingly actually clean and asked me, an inexperienced donut, where I wanted the jewellery to sit. I said right in the dimple of my nose which I now know is not the correct spot for a nose stud.

He cleaned and marked my nose and asked me if I was happy and ready and I said yep, then he stuck the needle through my nose. The pain was horrible, by far the worst out of all the piercings I‚Äôve had since, and felt I quite nauseous, excuse my phrasing but it felt painfully thick. He stuck the jewellery in and I was good to go. A few days later, I messaged the piercing shop on Facebook to ask what size jewellery they use for nose piercings and found out that they‚Äôd pierced my nose with a 16 gauge needle. In hindsight that was not a place I should have gone to for my nose stud. I‚Äôve got smaller jewellery in my piercing now but I still can‚Äôt wear rings because of the positioning and it took over a year to properly heal, despite me taking very good care of it.

Not the worst story but definitely my worst piercing experience. My friend had a plastic tube left in her belly button piercing by the piercer which was pretty awful too.

What are your piercing horror stories?"

I‚Äôm only 19 but I had a whole map of the future laid out, getting my degree, working till I could afford to leave home, getting a car to gain more independence. But it all got scuppered by physical and mental illness. I watch all my friends enjoying their time at university that I had to drop out of.

But I know things will get better. Once I find a job (interview on Monday wish me luck!) I can start saving for a car which will give me freedom that I don‚Äôt have at the moment. From there I can save for a deposit on a rented place, eventually working full time hours. I‚Äôm on a weight loss plan at the moment to get me feeling healthier and more confident about my body. I‚Äôm going to go back to studying via an online university at some point in the future. 

You‚Äôve got to make a plan and just painstakingly work through each step. Use the years as markers. The best piece of motivation that I‚Äôve ever come up with is this: ‚ÄúIf you continue to make small changes you won‚Äôt be in the same place this time next year as you are now. Often you‚Äôll find that if you look back a year, things have already changed a little. 

Whether you‚Äôre 13 or 33, life is constantly changing and you can change with it or you can dig your heels in and be a stubborn little bitch about it, either way the times will change, the universe doesn‚Äôt wait for anyone.‚Äù

Make small changes and the universe will help you along, it has a way like that. If you want something you can have it, you just have to keep trying.

My doctor was quite impressed by my organisation but he was also very friendly too. He didn‚Äôt really do much to help me but he took the time to go through all my medications and the letter I wrote up too.
I‚Äôm going to see a psychiatrist on Friday and I‚Äôll be taking my folders with me again because as somebody else commented, doctors definitely listen more if you have the letters from other medical professionals as proof to back up what you‚Äôre saying. The one page summary is really useful but only if you have the letters to back it up, otherwise you could look like your telling them a bunch of nonsense."
