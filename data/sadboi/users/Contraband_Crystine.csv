We disagree about what makes music a ""guilty pleasure"" so I'd also like to know what defines the concept for you.

Ask her if she can handle resolving those situations in which that behavior is unwelcome. As a 23 year old, she's young and showing it, badly, but she should be able to recognize why this behavior isn't acceptable if explained to her by a friend trying to keep it real with her. She might get upset in the moment but if she's got any self awareness at all, I think it would help change the behavior you're currently having issues with so that you'd be okay with her coming to the wedding (maybe, at least?). But in the process of explaining, tell her she's not in the wedding party. And that if her behavior doesn't change at all, she's not invited: period. As a friend, I don't think going from her being in the wedding party to automatically uninvited would look good to other people and be hard to explain to C, herself, who at the end of the day I imagine you want to still be a friend of some measure. I think bring up front and honest about the problem and giving her the ultimatum makes it obvious that you're A) serious B) trying to give her the benefit of the doubt and C) seeking peace and happiness for your wedding, which no one should wish to hinder."

But, I've heard of a new platform called KinkRebel that is hoping to be the adult Patreon site; you can sign up for early access right now, but it's not fully launched, yet, unfortunately. Additionally, I saw that they plan to launch with three their options ($10, $20, and $30) which you already addressed as being too hight. 

While on OnlyFans you might have to deposit so much into your account at once, it's possible to charge as little as 2-3$/month for your particular page. For example, my page is regularly $7.69/mo but I can offer any % sale promotions for any duration (and # of subscribers); you can offer to let people promo your page for free for a selected amount of time; you can offer a month free for people who refer someone. Also, if you don't already use ManyVids they offer a similar tip-teir oriented system to Patreon but have a slew of other helpful tip-engaging mechanisms for sw. I hope this helps."

myfreecams,fgj3x5a,t3_eyqo6d,1580836511.0,"First of all, don't give up! It sounds like you are really passionate, hard-working, and knowledgeable. That puts you 5 steps ahead of a lot of cammers (like the ones always using their phone). I would start by simply refreshing your cam room/area. Do you have natural light available? Lighting is everything and good lighting makes a huge difference to viewers. I try to use as much natural light as possible, without keeping my blinds wide open, in addition to a small rechargable camera light that I got fairly cheap on Amazon ($30 maybe?). I also rotate through a few different tapestries that I've collected over time and sometimes have Christmas lights up. Set your stage: that's what your cam area technically is. For a long time, I struggled with chasing that ideal standard definition of beauty and what a good cam room 'should' look like. I've be seeing more success as I let that go and try more and more to create a space in which my auidence can experince something unique. I am the continuous factor on my stream but what I do every day and the place I set up is always evolving. I have the freedom to use my whole lil 2 bedroom apartment to do this now and that certainly helps. But even if you're confined to a single space, I recommend surrounding yourself with a few items that really bring you Joy and also allow you to have something to talk about or create common interests with your audience (pop culture references like pillows or posters; a stack of books you've been wanting to read; lovely litttle plants; an awesome lamp; your favorite pair of heels). Make your cam room your happy place, not just somewhere you have to be sitting and waiting for an audience. Try to make that space wholly unique and the experience you provide the same. Too many of us camgirls fall into routine, doing the same thing every day in the same space. And, further, we fall susceptible to wanting to do and look like what is already achieving success in this industry. However, what people are looking for is something different, unique, fun, and original. And, further, accepting that success can be achieved only in the ways it always has, denies every single one of us the possibility of finding new ways to be successful. Sorry if these are obvious things but from your post it sounds like you're looking to rebrand or shake things up & these are ways in which I've done the same recently."

So, for people that do sell items/digital content, posting watermarked (that matches your Reddit username are usually the only ones allowed) images from IMGUR and gifs from gfycat that are teasing, fun, and fit whichever subs you find is the best way to drive people to your page/your own subreddit. r/TittyDrop and r/pantypeel are easy, simple, high traffic pages that sellers and gw users both enjoy posting to, for example. The pages that allow you to sell expect you to have at least a week (if not more) of these types of posts to ensure that you are A) a real nsfw content creator/seller/sw 2) a real person, period 3) consenting to this type of work and 4) serious about selling. It's not easy to do and doing it willing nilly one night because you're strapped for cash is not the way this business works.

askwomenadvice,ffbvaz1,t3_esrnrq,1579783968.0,"This sounds like he might have anxiety around past relationship issues that have been unresolved. First things first: in order for things to work out, he's going to have to try. It doesn't seem like he has put forth the effort or understands the problem, fully. Being able to communicate and do it well is key to every relationship. And each one has their own language and learning curve. It's all up to him (and you) to put in the work to figure it out. 

Let me explain my original point. If he's somebody who is a good guy, has been in a few relationships (or just one long one), tried his best to make things work, but continually ended up with women who were somewhat abusive or manipulative (or relationships that just plain didn't work because they couldn't talk), then he has a lot of extra learning to do. Any criticism you bring up is automatically going to associated with all of that. Speaking from experience, for someone with anxiety to repeatedly hear the ""here's a problem"" conversation after being in a slew of bad relationships, all I heard from my current partner is ""you are a bad person / the problem"". I had to put in the work myself to recognize when/why I was feeling anxious about him voicing such concerns and ask questions about what my partner wants me to do to solve X. In those big conversations, more times than not, all he wanted was for me to acknowledge I understood. I had to learn the age old ""it's us versus the problem not you versus me"" and my anxiety made it 10x harder. Because my anxiety wants you to think I'm a bad guy so I can play the blame game and get angry and let that fear, anger, and guilt trip take control. My anxiety wants me to make my partner feel bad (like it makes me feel bad. It's selfish). It's a LONG stretch for not knowing you or your scenario completely but I, personally, think this is why he jumps to ""IM NOT A BAD GUY"" and gets so defensive. His anxiety and unresolved previous relationship problems are preventing him from learning a new love language. One that nurtures you both by allowing you to express your problems in a way that doesn't make the other one feel blame, guilt, or intense shame. 

Not everyone who posts their damn problems is in an abusive-""red flag""-GET. OUT.-type scenario and it's sad to see those are the only other answers you got. That being said, you know your relationship better than anyone and if there are other red flags, you continue to not feel heard or understood, or this person makes no effort to change: move on. Grow somewhere new.
