I have struggled with anxiety, depression and ptsd (mild) since the episodes led to diagnoses for my loved one. I love her, fiercely. She is my sister.
But her behaviour breaks my heart. She struggles with alcoholism as well.
So I am learning to meditate, write the negatives in a journal, and the positives in a gratitude journal daily.
Those steps are helping me.
I always take a breath (or ten) before responding.
And even if I‚Äôm angry or hurt, I choose to behave kindly. I refuse to act the way she does to prove a point or hurt her the same way. Sometimes I want to!
I just choose not to."

A parent would not ask this question. Being a parent gives you a different perspective on life. You are marrying a man with a child. Yes that child is a bit of an asshat at the moment, but it will change. Give her some time, changes in her hormones as well as her fathers relationships are going to be difficult for her to process.
Include her as much as possible, make her feel wanted. It‚Äôs not her day, no. But she is going to be your stepdaughter and you are the adult. She will love you, and you her, in time."
