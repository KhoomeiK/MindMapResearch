It consists in a constant contemplation of thoughts / feelings / sensations / phenomena to understand causes and effects in the workings of the mind. Also a deep cultivation of a good rooted morality is a strong base for the practice.
If you want to know more feel free to send me a pm and I'd be happy to recommend you a couple of books and YouTube channels withe great info and guide."

Then, after a few years I had my second deep depression episode and started working with clay and with painting I used acrylics and a more free ""no think too much"" style and gave me a huge break.

 I am happy to have had this episodes because they allowed me to explore different things and ways of expression, and the feeling of not relying on one single thing to express myself.
