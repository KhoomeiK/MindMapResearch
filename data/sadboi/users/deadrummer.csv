To answer you question:

>*not supposed to have any bond with the person that raised them at all*

Well if that is all one can choose from than I would probably go for no bond at all. Luckily we and the relationships we have are not binary. They are not all or nothing. There is a healthy middle-ground.

>Am I imagining this or what? Is it all hitting me like a ton of bricks because of the gulf between how I was socialized to act and how I'm expected to act now?

No you are not imagening it, and that is probably the reason why it hits you so hard and unexpectedly.

In my experience, and this is only about men I got to know good enough to judge, every single man was either in a healthy adult relationship with his parents ^((the vast majority)) or was a ""momma's boy"" ^((only \~3)) most of them were raised by single mothers at least most of their lives. Nothing in between, and every man in a close relationship with his mother was so focused on her that in case of differences or arguments she was number one priority over everyone else even their chosen partner. This wasn't the case with men who have a close relationship to only their fathers.I don't know why that is, but it is what I experienced, and judging by the very existence of such a generalized reaction towards mother-son-bonds there is probably something to it.

&#x200B;

That maybe different for transmen who didn't transition until adulthood (=were socialized as women), or some individuals. I don't claim to know that about like half of earths population, but on the other hand not one of the ""momma boys"" were aware of their behaviour.

Also, with compound words you can usually get a good idea what they mean when you can seperate them into the compounds. Here it would be 'Ideal' and 'Vorstellung'.
