My 3rd one was done by my neurologist in the er even though it was scheduled. It took her 17 different tries and she sat me up in the middle of it to try it that way. My pressure was 4 when she was done."
iih,fp8dxkg,t1_fp8c27c,1588389877.0,"I had quite a few LPs that way. I would go in begging for one. Eventually they weren't able to do them with out fluoroscopy due to scar tissue, so I couldnt get them done in the er. In the beginning though fighting in the er was usually how I got one."

iih,fnaljct,t1_fnaehbh,1586799583.0,"I was driving home from my friends house, sitting at a stop light and I blacked out for a second. I freaked out a bit but i was in my first musical in high school and we were a few weeks from the performance so I wasnt going to miss it. I felt dizzy the whole time that day. Then the headaches started. I was 16 so we went to my pediatrician and they just said it was stress. My vision starting getting really blurry and we went back to the doctor every single day for a week until they finally said I needed to get to a ophthalmologist, who luckily my pediatrician helped me call and find. I had papilledema and a very bad visual field. We got me a LP as soon as we could. I was at the musical practice the same day as the LP not knowing how stupid it was.

Once a year after that I would go through the same symptoms. 

10 years later I had put on a ton of weight and was experiencing symptoms for months at a time. I had no apparent visual loss though and no papilledema so no one would do anything. I was out of hope, I couldnt get an LP and doctors started refusing to see me because the thought i was making it up. I ended up applying to clinical trials to get a stent (this was 2016 when it wasnt really a thing) I got accepted. I flew to NYC and I had very little papilledema and when they did an LP it came back normal. I had records of every LP and doctors appointment over the past 10 years, real proof that I had been suffering for so long. The doctors saw that and thank god still gave me the stent. The doctors think that because I had so many LPs that my pressure was building up and draining itself over and over again which is why I didnt have the damage. The stent changed my life and I am 4 years symptom free now."

A few months ago the home got bought by a huge company. One day she went to sew and everything was gone. They took everything she had and moved in to storage in the basement. When she went to find out where it all went she found out that they had hidden it in storage in the basement and were not going to let her have it back.

I was sick non stop for 4 months straight at the time and my doctors wouldn't do anything including giving me a spinal tap. I sent in all of my scans despite my doctors saying I didnt qualify and a few weeks later was on a flight to New York. 

The surgery was pretty easy, I was awake for the angiogram but didnt feel anything. I had some bad headaches the day after but nowhere near what I had been dealing with. The worst thing that came out of it was horrible heartburn. 

I was looking at getting a shunt at the time, but was scared to death after watching how many shunt revisions a family friend was going through. I still worry it's going to come back, but I am now living my life again, and feel like I actually have a future in front of me. I couldnt be more thankful to the doctors who helped me.

When I got diagnosed there was barely any research. Now they have so much more research on it, it was to the point that I saw the most well-known specialist the time and he couldnt tell me anything at all about why I was so sick.
 
After nearly 10 years of being sick all the time and having a horrible outlook on my future, I had a stent put in and I am 3 years symptom free. There is hope, they are continuing to learn more and more about this horrible disease everyday.

You will make it through this, it sucks and it's tough but it is manageable in most cases. You have so much to life to live, dont be like me and make this your everything. Find joy in the little things that make you happy. Keep pushing through this, you are stronger than this disease.

The nuvaring caused mine to flare up after being on it for 3 days, I hadn't had a symptom in over a year. I have been on the paragard ever since and it was the best decision ever."
trees,fcz6nl9,t1_fcz5xc2,1578094746.0,I am about 3 hours away from my house in the subarbs in a more rural town. This was the only dispensary in the area and my boyfriend and I wanted our first purchase to be together. There are a lot more dispensaries up by where I live so I will be have a lot more choices and places to research when I go back home and make my next purchase.

As soon as it was almost Christmas I would be ready for my next spinal tap. It was always December or January when I had flare ups for 8 years straight. No one was ever able to explain why."
youseeingthisshit,fbtgn9r,t3_ee9csc,1577078203.0,My boyfriend has been talking about this stream for weeks. He kept talking about how much this cause meant to Dr Lupo and how amazing it was that he was doing this. He then stayed up all night last night watching it. I woke up just in time to watch this exact moment. I was in full blown tears watching it. It is so heart warming to see someone care so much about helping someone else.
