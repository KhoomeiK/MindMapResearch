MovieSuggestions,fojoz2x,t3_g7n4zg,1587826260.0,"Although these aren’t guilty pleasures for me - I’ve got no shame in my film game! - they’d probably fall into this category.

First one I thought of was Empire Records (1995) - killer soundtrack with a ridiculously solid cast, catching quite a few actors in the beginning’s of their careers.

Second one that I actually saw someone else mention - Bio-Dome (1996). Paulie Shore said something along the lines that In The Army Now started his slow decent into fading out of popularity, which affected Bio-Dome... or rather that his typical “weasel” character wasn’t popular anymore starting with In The Army Now.

Link directly to clip from full podcast talking about his slow decent from the top - [Link](https://youtu.be/zLUDWooPUJM).

Edit: And I think I can also disappointingly add King Arthur: Legend of The Sword (2017). The world just did not respond to this well, whatsoever. I absolutely loved it... Guy Ritchie’s fast paced direction and cuts and gritty storytelling of underground crime drama put into a medieval setting with fantastical elements of wizardry and mayhem. This is so ridiculously up my alley. And idk if this makes sense, but I thought it was neat that in my mind the movie still was an underground UK crime drama, just with the medieval setting as the backdrop, as opposed to being a medieval movie... 

Regardless, I’m really bummed it didn’t continue its planned series."

I love my SL mkiii, and the keybed is fine, but thinking from this piano player’s perspective perhaps you’d rather go a different route. But, maybe you’re aware of this and chose the controllers without that much concern towards the keybed. Food for thought though. And as much as I love the novation sl mkiii, it was a sleeper. Depending where ya read, there are enough who think it was a pretty bud deal of a release like I do. I sincerely don’t understand why it wasn’t such a huge hit, when taking into consideration the price point, size, features, seamless implementation with Ableton and hardware, the pads... could have used a nicer frame/encasing, more sturdy and less plastic, but that would have taken it to another tier money wise... which I’d be fine with I think, but for one looking to not hit a grand for a controller, maybe not.

If you don’t touch the joystick, the reticle is pretty much where ya want it to be when shooting someone (if you roll up on each other in close quarters, anyway), so I pretty much used the right and left C buttons to get around much moreso than using the joystick to turn then go forward.

Edit: A few comments down (on my screen anyway), someone said it In a much better way than I did. Although they were referring to Turok, the same logic applies - “You use the -C buttons to move and strafe, and the joystick to aim.” And that’s exactly it.

Would absolutely love to sell all four together, but in pairs would be just fine, too. The total ticket price was $480.60, coming out to $120.15 per. Please contact me if with any questions or concerns. More than willing to hash it out together!

Thanks guys, and hope to hear from ya soon!"
movies,f5nq32h,t3_dod3ub,1572302950.0,"Yeah, this is the case with super giant blockbusters and popcorn films and mainstream fill in the blank (and I’m sure smaller budgeted films too but maybe not as much?) but there’s so much original gnarly content released pretty regularly. Enough that there’s no chance to watch it all. It’s awesome. And maybe this “resurgence” of reboots and remakes was inevitable. Entertainment - as far as being able to document it via film and what not, hasn’t been around that long. Maybe it was bound to happen.

Just spitballing."

MovieSuggestions,f5k63en,t1_f5jshjb,1572255849.0,"if only i was able to convey to OP how ""Brick"" fits this the best, and is at least top 3 suggestions. I'd throw in ""Winter's Bone"" and ""a History of Violence"" from David Cronenberg. All three are ridiculously original (as far as my personal knowledge goes) and so well done. All have the vibe I'm into.

Also, OP, ""Running Scared"" is totally killer, super under rated in my opinion. Don't see it mentioned too often at all, glad to see you dig it. That's one of the wildest rides out there, I'd say. It's such nonstop road movie that just keeps going and doesn't give you a break.. and... idk, really neat flick, that one. Like the filters they used, super gritty."

DMT,f5fh4k8,t1_f5cuevu,1572182474.0,"The only thing that rings true within this statement is the fact that it’s a relatively simple process. Very involved, and depending on your POV, it doesn’t take long, either. Can start the extracting process at 4 PM, and be done by 9, maybe earlier.

Probably will hate that link too, but still wanted to share it with ya. Saw rick and morty shit in your history. Doesn’t mean you like breaking bad obviously. But yeah. Also, this one actually arrived at my spot yesterday (again, just cuz you dig rick and morty doesn’t mean you dig John wick, but here anyway)

Almost sure because I remember a friend of mine didn’t come in the following day - took a personal day to get down hahah. I remember how cool I thought it was, jumping down onto that giant scarab. Such a solid reminisce.

Edit: scrolled down and saw some comments say that apparently it wasn’t the first midnight release. Oh well, still an unbelievably cool walk down memory street!"

MovieSuggestions,f3xgthi,t1_f3x4uy9,1571238037.0,"I watched it and enjoyed it thoroughly myself, however, I was reluctant to find that the movie was French (I believe) and they recast all of the voices with mainstream American actors. i.e. rob lowe, Patton Oswalt, Ed helms, etc. Not that I don’t like them necessarily, I’m just a fan of checking things out as they were originally intended, ya know? But they didn’t even give you that option on Netflix which I thought was sad and kind of... shitty, I suppose.

Edit: The French realization was after the lucky stumbling upon the flick."
