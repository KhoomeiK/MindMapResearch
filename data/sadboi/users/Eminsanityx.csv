dogs,fqlqlie,t3_gjb10z,1589464175.0,"Some rescues have their reason. I worked at a rescue that only allowed certain dogs to go to a home with no fenced in yard. The dogs that required fences were southern rescues who would literally shut down/panic/scream/yelp when put on a leash or harness of any kind. I know this isn't the case with all rescues, and I definitely think a lot of rescues require a LOT of ridiculous stuff. But this, I can understand in some cases."

BPD,fp8envc,t3_gbwt3i,1588390394.0,"If you're not happy single, you'll become co dependent once you get into a relationship. You need to spend time with yourself, start hobbies, be fulfilled while you're alone so that when you do get into a relationship you don't have the thought of ""if we break up my life is over because being single is miserable"". 

BPD makes us prone to co dependency and it's really the worst situation for us to be in. Remember that you're not looking for your other half, because you're not a half. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

Dogtraining,fnnly39,t3_g2qqoc,1587095514.0,"When he starts to lunge/pull/bark tell him ""no"" swiftly turn around and walk in the opposite direction. Once he's calmed down, then and walk towards the person again. Repeat this until you're able to have him walk by someone calmly. You'd obviously need someone the dog doesn't know to help you with this- so it might be best saved for when this quarantine is over. 

Another option is to redirect his focus on you when he sees another person. Get the most high value treat (for my dog, it's mcdonald's chicken nuggets!) call him back over to you and reward him once his attention shifts back to you. This is a good thing to practice in general, anytime your dog sees someone/sees a squirrel/hears a loud noise- you should try to get him to redirect his focus on you and ""check in"" with you."
