raisedbynarcissists,fqzuxrs,t1_fqza8h3,1589776008.0,I recently found some stuff about fear/obligation/guilt (FOG) that keeps the cycle going it's been really enlightening. I think that's the shortened name for what's being described on this post. You aren't alone <3

My brother has one of those stories (kind of) except he stuck a battery wayy up his nose when he was little and it started leaking acid and a team of drs had to hold him down to pull it out so I'm really relieved to hear it was alright. I really don't want to go to emergency rn bc I think they probably already have enough to deal with considering the pandemic plus exposing myself to germs so that was really helpful thank you :)"
piercing,fqt1d6m,t1_fqt0xzw,1589626582.0,"Yeah I  just called but everythings after hours/booked out in my area rn unless I go to hospital, have not moved my head since this happened.. I've got my ear facing the ground but my necks getting sore lol was changing over to something smaller(too damn small it fell all the way into my brain pretty much) we got creative tried using a micrdermabbrasion vaccuum to get it out (wasn't airtight and on the lowest setting) and we just found a fridge magnet that seems to be working on the jewelry I was using... (stay tuned haha) it hurts a little and hearings definitely muffled in that ear rn. I am concerned. Lmao thanks for your advice I appreciate it"
raisedbynarcissists,fqcbrlt,t1_fqap1i1,1589254425.0,If you're the reactive one that refuses to accept the abuse and don't play into the secrecy/acceptance/submission code they usually make you the scapegoat
raisedbynarcissists,fpuss9l,t1_fprj1j3,1588922481.0,Right. And if they have really bad scapegoat syndrome they have a completely different set of rules for you so you are set up to fail.
raisedbynarcissists,fpn7mc6,t3_geb9s4,1588753039.0,"All I can say is beware challenging a narcissist they can turn so nasty! I actually saw so much of my family dynamics in your story and wish you all the best. One thing I learned recently is sometimes the golden child is impossible to deprogram bc they can't relate to your struggle because they wont have as much trauma shaping the memories of your parents. I feel like it best to just let the relationships be as I feel like I damaged the relationship with mine trying to tell them enough to understand and they just decided if it was going to be sides they choose Nmom (I have a feeling it has to do with certain inheritance reasons lol)
Someone was talking about ""hero complex"" in the workplace recently maybe your Mom has that and that's why she's crazy defensive about her parenting skills and also, she was soo just complimenting herself when she got your sis to dress up. Don't let them steamroll your boundaries trying to look out for theirs. If you jump into the line of fire for your siblings and get burned and they still choose to continue to be codependent toxic with the Nparent and don't realize, acknowledge or appreciate what you did stop doing that. It might eventually turn into resentment for and from your sis too. Good luck navigating your struggle you seem like you got good insight dude. Don't let anyone deny your personhood"
raisedbynarcissists,fpj0gvj,t3_gaq98g,1588653246.0,"Another thing I had a realization about how the Barnabys have one jumper to share and they didn't bother naming both of them, I feel that was really clever too. I wonder if many narcissistic parents name their children similar names/rhyming names as if it's quirky or they come as a pair and they don't care enough to tell them apart or see them as separate people.. and I also think the jumper represents that there's not enough warmth in the family for both of them (something I feel is really relevant having to fight for any affection from parents that don't have the capacity to love and care for more than one kid at a time ... and they didn't stop after having two kids either)."
raisedbynarcissists,fpizwit,t1_fp55k6k,1588652820.0,The plot thickens haha
raisedbynarcissists,fpcak2s,t3_gci8zk,1588493340.0,Someone said something recently about narcs seeing others not as people but as characters in their story. I feel like I've seen my nmom transform and mimmick the drama of whatever show she gets hooked on. I feel like it adds detail and texture to their own fantasy world? Btw ny nmom also likes Gilmore Girls and I agree. It normalizes unhealthy abd immature mother/daughter relationships
raisedbynarcissists,fp5fosg,t1_fp5el37,1588327659.0,They just can't comprehend so much bad happening to one person I think it's too much for some (especially sheltered people) to take in. Best to be strategic who you confide in
raisedbynarcissists,fp509zf,t1_fp3emig,1588312283.0,"I feel like first world middle class families tend to prefer psychological abuse to extreme physical violence. The way it's hidden in plain sight might take more of a mental toll than physical pain. (Something a dr said to me once but I think he was telling me to get over it lol) he said someone hits you it stops hurting soon, when something fucks with your head you keep thinking about it/reliving it and it makes your whole life suffer if you can't move on. I've been hit and psychologically abused and honestly I tend to agree that the impacts of the psychological abuse were incomparable with pain that didn't last long. However the fact that someone who is supposed to be the only dependable source of love and protection could scare and hurt me so much is also confusing so it's still kind of having a psychological effect... In first world countries we grew up with fairytales, Disney and empty promises. I find that I've been through a lot more trauma than my friendship group but people tend to believe that couldn't be the case until I tell them but I believe it's due to my appearence. If you make things appear perfect on the surface people tend to believe it. They have no idea what went into making what's in front of them. Good quote goes something like ""everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about so be kind always""."
raisedbynarcissists,fp4yvhl,t1_fp29kht,1588311122.0,They are the worst. I liked the way they were portrayed like aliens/MIB in the Willoughbys. I hope that movie makes them a lil less scary to kids. I cried when I thought about how it would feel being taken away by CPS when they're at an age they don't understand properly. Also the part in the Gabriel Fernandez case when there's footage of them removing the kids from their parents it's not okay. Never will be.
raisedbynarcissists,fp4ulbe,t1_fp4sjjj,1588307787.0,But we still have that fear/worry in the back of our minds. Like they somehow will find out and are gonna be coming for revenge or to try regain control over our minds with their abusive tactics lol Mine used to eavesdrop and spy so much so I know how nosey they can be
raisedbynarcissists,fp4tgcv,t1_fp4rgao,1588306951.0,"Me too ! Not many people understand it don't bother talking to anyone about it if they aren't prepared to research and educate themselves beforehand. Otherwise they become judgemental/minimizing without even realizing it, it's called complex trauma for a reason. Not everyone is entitled to your story (especially if they don't bother to understand it and later judge you for it) but it becomes really fucked bc most people just think you're being a narc, liar or hypercondreact or something or decided your story makes no sense (especially if you had multiple traumas happening in different aspects of your life ie: school, family, friends, work and sometimes all at once) it becomes a story that's too hard for simple people to follow. My thoughts anyways..."
raisedbynarcissists,fp4sqk6,t3_gb3p0f,1588306429.0,Yeah when I was a teen even it made me sad I would just be trying to shut down and not cry if I ever saw photos or videos of lil me... it was like I knew how naive and innocent I was for this cruel world/cruel family. And same with one of my friends who got abused if I see his childhood photos I cry too bc I can actually see the torture and lost innocence in his expression and his eyes <\3
SuicideWatch,fp4h4ap,t3_gb4iiv,1588298926.0,"I used to feel this way I was terrified of growing up/getting old/becoming boring and losing my fire I can't even explain what it was exactly... Can confirm it's doesn't really feel like that. I found I reached an enlightened age when I got to 25 everything started making sense and people start to take you more seriously/show you more respect all of a sudden. I'm glad i stuck around to make it to when it turned out okay. And I was wrong about life becoming boring when you get older. You just get more freedom to do the things you weren't allowed to as a kid. I was also scared I would lose all my piercings and change into boring clothes to conform like a robot but you just figure out your true style and it becomes more refined the older you get. Being in your teens was like looking at a polaroid while it's developing, hoping desperately it would turn out to be a good picture but you don't get to see or understand the subject matter until it's finished developing."
raisedbynarcissists,fp49885,t1_fp14c93,1588294227.0,"My empath Dad didn't see the little things right up until just before he died, my nmom had kicked me out of home for having pink hair when I was 17 and one day her and my sis just came over to his house where I was staying, forced me to dye my hair black (it looked sooo bad) anyways my nmom tried to search my room/go through my things while my sis distracted me and my dad caught her doing that and just realized that day how controlling and invading they were over my whole life... they left as soon as they finished putting the black packet dye in my hair and my Dad was just shocked at the way they did it it was like he had no words... he just said ""I always thought you were the black sheep but that was so fucked. They made you ruin your hair and they didn't even stay to see how it turned out...?"" he called them stormtroopers the way they operated and asked if it was always like that and said he was ""so sorry"". It was nice to finally get some validation. I always wonder what it would have been like if he didn't die so shortly afterwards (it was a few months later). It was like I had hope that he was gonna be the hero that finally rescues me from this just before it was all lost again. I constantly have those feelings of hope followed by disappointment from my family :/"
raisedbynarcissists,fp442lr,t1_fp1vkk2,1588291276.0,Thanks for putting that in perspective I've been learning about it more and it was definitely eye opening. And thanks for that example I thought it was so interesting that something that has the potential to be so diabolical could be such a common/casual defence to shame. I love that toddler response example you used bc it actually sounds like an response from an adult narc 😂
raisedbynarcissists,fp42mky,t1_fp2b4ee,1588290467.0,"That's very true, I think they make it contagious though bc if you're being constantly targeted by a narc that is paranoid and doing crazy shit you start getting paranoid about what crazy shit they might do to you next and learn hypervigillence from walking on eggshells all the time but I think it ties into anxiety more for the latter... Once they've completely invaded your privacy and tried to take control of your thoughts you start acting different. Like they could be waiting to spring out from every corner. Might be a ptsd symptom tho bc I have that..."
raisedbynarcissists,fp41sjd,t1_fp31i8r,1588290006.0,Thank you! And I have considered the same thing it's like they are just so used to rolling with the punches for her conditional love that they forgot who is actually the one throwing all the punches... I sometimes am grateful that at least I have this knowledge and this sub now and actually feel a bit sorry for them that it's become something they are stuck with because it's not always so bad for them that they have to detatch from her so the cycle continues... You never know she might pick one of them to scapegoat next now she doesn't get to do it to me. It's actually sad thinking about it and I bet they still wont understand what she's really doing they'll just try harder to get approval again...
raisedbynarcissists,fp3ymr9,t1_fp3bmc5,1588288263.0,They call in bomb threats too when they're really mad 😂
raisedbynarcissists,fp3yf0y,t1_fp32pds,1588288145.0,"Me too. I think it's definitely saying something that we fear the reaction of the narcs if they knew, like that our privacy and thoughts have been monitored and groomed wayy too much to the point where we've become hypervigilant waiting for them to spring out from every corner or wondering what they could do to us next :/"
raisedbynarcissists,fp3t9tq,t1_fp2r5ur,1588285395.0,"It was so weird I felt like it had to have some symbolic meaning otherwise that's such a random detail 😂 i read online that it had something to do with ""stringing the family together"" or something like that and that she threatens to punish the kids for ""disturbing her knitting"" but she ""can't knit"" so maybe it just goes to show how senselessly selfish narc parents are?"
raisedbynarcissists,fp1p53d,t3_gaq98g,1588243300.0,"What was with her cutting her husbands moustache tho? And then saying she ""can't knit"" interested to find out what that represents... Maybe that she's taking away his greatness by being so selfish and him enabling that? Thoughts anyone?"

It's great to get to an age of enlightenment I'm glad I hung in there for that long. Totally agree everything sucked and was so confusing when you're younger tho...
raisedbynarcissists,fp15pu5,t1_fp14pvg,1588225139.0,You've been conditioned to accept their behaviour. You probably felt comfortable having a similar abusive relationship dynamic to what you've grown up with which isn't your fault. Narcissistic parents raise their kids to be narcississtic supply and so when you go out in the dating world other narcs will find you agreeable/controllable/easy to manipulate and act on it. Take care <3

raisedbynarcissists,fp13g5h,t3_gapd99,1588223353.0,"I have one scenario so relevant (though my nmom was constantly reminding us of the ""favourite child"" food chain, think in an effort to get us to compete for her approval, this is called triangulation it's an abuse tactic.) But anyways when my sister (her favourite tool) got married she was saying to my golden child brother he was no longer the favourite child. Her new son in law was her new favourite child. This was in her damn speech at the wedding lol I lost my shit and laughed so hard then yelled out to my bro he was welcome to be a black sheep with me (I'm actually a scapegoat but my nmom wouldn't be able to handle me publicly hinting that she's an abuser)."
raisedbynarcissists,fp12zoo,t1_fp12mmv,1588223004.0,Yeah and the drama and victimization of mines narrative when really she's the abuser is really something to behold... They're so messed up inside
raisedbynarcissists,fp12rgc,t1_fp11qll,1588222832.0,Yep I started doing weird shit too knowing how hard she was screening I found this code I could use instead of letters so I could still write about what she was doing (I think I was unconciously aware of gaslighting and it's effects but at the time I didn't have a name for it and just thought of it as brainwashing tactics and I was just determined to have control over my own thoughts and memory). I can't do anything with my appearence without them shaming me and acting like it's a reflection of how I see them as a parent and they act all victimized as if I'm trying to signal outsiders and their friends about their abuse with what I wear. I'm not even kidding about that.
raisedbynarcissists,fp11utc,t1_fp10m7d,1588222167.0,When I was younger it was really hard to get anyone to take it seriously unless they've seen it firsthand (alot of narcissists are covert operators so witnesses are few and far between and usually don't intervene) make sure you go to people who are trauma informed and understand narcissism or bring sources that are relevant as back up if they try to write it off as teen angst/rebellion or whatever don't talk to them. I had a problem with my school councellor back in the day they just wanted to mediate with me and my nmom but that doesn't always work with narcissists and it can make them vengeful at losing control of you and your thoughts and more abusive when you get home. Please don't be put off if you meet a few incompatable psychologists/councellors I didn't have anyone take me seriously until I was older sadly.
raisedbynarcissists,fp0zw59,t1_fp0z3o5,1588220790.0,"Yep. It's like they're talking about a different person!!! I get so frustrated I've barely spoken to them in 10 years and they still think they know more about me than I do !!!! It's like they never bothered to acknowledge you as a person with your own thoughts and feelings, do you feel the same?"
raisedbynarcissists,fp0yuf2,t1_foz0goy,1588220070.0,Mine would constantly complain about it to us like we were deliberately being demanding and after complaining about the food we needed she would then start complaining about buying TP as if it was some cruel sick joke we were playing on her lol she was abusive and neglectful of basic needs and she expects unwavering respect/adoration for not letting us starve. Smh
raisedbynarcissists,fp0y0i0,t3_gac5vn,1588219503.0,"Yeah mine would hold onto a bunch of ""secrets"" she'd collected by following/stalking us secretly as teens, (we were actually just trying to be f***ing normal but she was determined to catch us doing something so she could use it for leverage later) she was reading any journals she could find, spending her days going through our rooms while we were at school looking for contraband (which if she found she wouldn't confiscate. it was the dirt on us that she could later use as blackmail that she really wanted). and only addressed these issues when she felt like she needed a punching bag. They would ignore us quite a lot of the time and then unexpectedly snap and lose their shit then go on and on and on and just keep building momentum trying to bury us and just completely taking out all their frustration all at once. It was scary especially when she was drunk."
raisedbynarcissists,fp0rykr,t1_fp0pyra,1588215597.0,Thank you. It was really messed up. I honestly stopped talking when I got into secondary school as I was at total emotional shut down from abuse so it was absolutely insane to watch them connnecting dots that weren't there and making evaluations and drawing conclusions about me when I would try only do one word answers and wouldn't respond when they made me out to be the fucked up one. They were projecting sooo bad. I'm still mad about it lol
raisedbynarcissists,fp0r1yq,t1_fp0q59s,1588215036.0,Yes one of the responses of narc parents tends to be being defensive/reactive as a reflex to gaslighting and situations when you have a flashback (you might not realize that's whats happening) but if you have someone you can talk to in depth about why you're seeing something in a threatening way it helps so much to trace the toxicity back to it's origins and you realize it's conditioning. A lot of narcissists actually thrive off the reactive defences bc it makes it easier to control you and dismiss you as crazy. It's bad when parents nuture that in their children it's basically raising them to be narcissitic supply like a lamb to slaughter.

raisedbynarcissists,fp0ph6q,t1_fp0n88e,1588214069.0,"Thank you for saying this. I totally agree with you and believe to act like or think that you are perfect and to focus on others toxicity is to become the narcissist yourself. It's healthy to be honest with yourself, practice what you preach and always be open minded to learning about new things. The self awareness is the difference between us and them."
raisedbynarcissists,fp0nvzk,t1_fozzo61,1588213099.0,So glad your psych saw through what she was doing my nmom tried to groom mine when I was too young to properly understand the sickness in our family. She wanted to be sure she would dismiss me and tell me I was just a bad kid and that my behaviour had nothing to do with being a normal reaction to child abuse...
raisedbynarcissists,fp0nd74,t1_foy03po,1588212782.0,"Yes!!! I have had experiences similar to yours. Years ago a thought popped into my head that I still hold close to my heart to this day.

I hope the dark days are over for you now thanks for sharing your experience <3"
raisedbynarcissists,fp0mps2,t1_fp0k0hw,1588212392.0,"Same here, and a friend told me her experience was the same just this week. Her nmom started showing signs she was going to try make some real progress/take responsibility for abuse/build a deeper connection with her then suddenly got cold feet and put a wall up until my friend straight up asked ""I'll never get this from you will I?"" (Validation and a legitimate mother/daughter relationship that is) it's chilling to hear how similar our experiences are... I hope things are looking up for you too !"
raisedbynarcissists,fp0m966,t3_gala9y,1588212118.0,Gaslighting at it's finest. It's psychological manipulation narcissists use that's similar to brainwashing found a good article explaining the effects.  https://blogs.psychcentral.com/recovering-narcissist/2019/03/7-gaslighting-phrases-malignant-narcissists-sociopaths-and-psychopaths-use-translated/
raisedbynarcissists,fp0lxh7,t1_fp0jw6v,1588211928.0,"Thank you! I think I figured out the simplified version: explanations are okay, excuses aren't... and it's okay to hold them accountable for their abusive actions (they were an adult and you were a defenceless child who was depending on them). But to blame them for all your shortcomings or making them feel guilty for things that are out of their control and then granting yourself permission to treat others badly because it happened to you is where I think the tipping point on the narcissism scale begins where you need to check your thought process. Also being approachable for others to hold you accountable for your actions and empathizing is also a healthy way to keep yourself in check. hope this all makes sense sorry for all these novels I'm writing"
raisedbynarcissists,fp0izag,t1_fozv8mj,1588210218.0,That's a good way to put it. I think it's natural to be frustrated by it though if that helps... it's like seeing people get a hand up and support to succeed while a narcississtic parent holds you back or tries to use you like a stepladder and the well adjusted kids look at you and wonder why you're progress is so slow or far behind. I'm jealous too lol
raisedbynarcissists,fp0hv4r,t1_foztdzu,1588209580.0,"Yes, I feel this when I have to watch my nmoms relationships with my other siblings (the golden child and the tool) she seems to have the capacity to love them so why not me? I had to try so much harder for approval I never recieved because I'm the scapegoat there's no good reason or explanation for it and the siblings have been taught there's something wrong with me or they don't want what I'm going through so they pacify her and also help to gang up/abuse and gaslight me and I watched them grow up as if looking through the glass at a family (it was codependence actually) so it really does hurt. ""Feels like drowning while you can see everyone around you able to breathe""."
raisedbynarcissists,fp0fzev,t3_gahcil,1588208516.0,Agreed. My nmom projects on me telling me I hate her and just want to blame her for everything. No child ever just hated their parents for no good reason. I treat my dog better than they ever treated me.
raisedbynarcissists,fp0dk0o,t1_fp0c7j5,1588207196.0,"I just want to add that I would be open to having these discussions with my parents around my childhood trauma and I would be open to forgiving them and have tried to many,many times if they had the capacity to acknowledge the abuse we were subjected to and give an explanation or apology or even just validation, it could be different but they just blow up and gaslight you as a response or pretend to not remember but they do. If they aren't prepared to make it a two way street without projecting on you and being more toxic to deny the abuse you will never get anything from them except more trauma and gaslighting."
raisedbynarcissists,fp0c7j5,t1_fp06zl6,1588206469.0,"Yes just last night I got right down to it. I honestly feel the need to practice what I preach to make sure it's fair and justified thought process. I was saying to my boyfriend that I'm sorry for not respecting his sleep patterns and when I couldn't sleep from PTSD and then getting annoyed that he's grumpy and restless too... It actually took me to read a post on here to realize that what I was doing was fucked... but as a child my parents were bar workers and fishing at the same time so Edad would be up at 3-4am every morning and they would be up until the bar closed and me and sis would be put the bed at weird times as kids and I just never realized this was such unhealthy sleep hygeine and that people need to sleep to function normally. Me and boyfriend know that we were being so toxic to each other now and my sleep was getting worse the more we spiralled. But for my boyfriend to accept my apology and forgive me too I also need to make sure that's not a double standard and to also practice the same forgiveness to my parents. An example I'll use is that though they were undeniably abusive, in this instance I do not blame my parents for not teaching us how to have good sleep hygeine because it wasn't their choice to deny us the life skills, it was their jobs, if that makes sense? If I expect my boyfriend to forgive me I must explain where I realize I was going wrong it is my sleeping problems and history that have caused this. I acknowledge that is unfortunate but it's not anyones fault it's my responsibility now and I'm going to work on it. The difference between that and narcississtic abuse is that we are prepared to listen, acknowledge and self reflect on how we make others feel and practice the same forgiveness we would expect or hope for for something that's out of our control. Narcississtic parents though are controlled by immature and unfair self entitled forgiveness/adoration/appreciation demands without ever caring how badly they are neglecting others experience. I hope that helps? If anyone has a simpler way to explain this pls do sorry for the length :)"
raisedbynarcissists,fp08bbt,t1_foy7ovv,1588204362.0,"My heart goes out to you. I have been here before though I only had one abusive parent to deal with. Please know your worth. Perfectionism will not help you if you're trying to impress or win over a narcissist. Once you're out of there don't look back. Don't question yourself. You are not deserving of this abuse and never let them make you doubt yourself or feel sorry for them. They are in a position of power and they are abusing it. Talk to a friend, explain whats going on, plan and identify some resources and allies. I was kicked out many times due to my appearence but my nmom would make it so she had control over me even when she'd banished me from my house (I believe it's illegal to abandon you if you're under the age of 16 not sure about where you live maybe check your local laws). If you think that's going to happen soon, please plan ahead your resources and ways to be independant. My nmom kicked me back and forth making me feel worthless and enjoying playing hero for taking me back in after she'd gossip and lie about why I wasn't at home telling people I was a monster and making homeless teen life actually worse than it already is. (Honestly better than being abused all the time I wish I'd stuck it out until I made it myself personally)... No child or teen should ever have to go through this."
raisedbynarcissists,fp05069,t1_foy5u2z,1588202598.0,"Thank you, I did a lot of work on this yesterday. As long as we're self aware and honest with ourselves about it and prepared to do the work to eduacate and heal ourselves so we don't in turn become toxic to others, we will never be like them.
This fear I have about unconciously mirroring them is like my perfectionism has been held hostage by my families gaslighting tactics. I needed to let go of the perfectionism though it only got that bad for fear of abandonment from my family but I realize now it was never about how ""perfect"" I could or should be. Abandonment is the actions and choice of those leaving you or conditionally loving you... Perfectionism wont help you if you're trying to impress a narcissist. That way lies madness."

Its a bit ignorant of the complexity of a whole human and is dissmissive of their own trauma but I made some good progreas talking to my boyfriend about it last night trying to unblur the lines between behaviours and reactions of abusers and the reactions of someone who has been gaslit and abused as a child and now suffers from flashbacks and other reactions which are damaging to their adult relationships. I decided to ask my boyfriend if he could point out if he thinks I'm doing anything toxic (he is really informed about narcississtic abuse/gaslighting now so we can have really good chats about it he's come a long way from becoming abusive towards me out of not understanding why I see the world through such a fucked up lense until I had to move in with the nfam for space and he saw how they treated me and understands now what happened to me) so he is really open minded and knows how to listen now. So thankful we learned all this or we wouldn't have made it. And I was able to explain and apologize for being accidentally toxic while I was going through some shit and he acknowledged that he was doing tge exact same thing and neither of us were equipped to deal with the problems at the time. The narcissists in my family, however, do not self reflect or apologize for the horrific abuse they did to me. They actually gaslight me more and then lie about their actions and then just repeat the abuse. I think it comes down to this... No one person is a perfect narcississt at all times, (that I know of anyway) we all carry narcississtic traits but it's not a problem unless your so high on the scale you give yourself permission to treat people like shit and think that's okay... as long as we are honest with ourselves and keep it in check, it's okay. I also think it is our individual relationships with these people that are toxic. The toxic narcississts can have normal social lives where they are friends/coworkers/whatever and because the individual relationships are differentt they aren't seen as an abusive piece of shit by those people bc they are putting on a different mask when they interact with those people. I think they only abuse their scapegoats usually and then they gaslight them so they can act like the abuse never happened. Another thing that I know of which I found interesting... None of my abusers understood what gaslighting was (and I tend to really believe that) none of us knew what it was but it was rampant in all of my abusive relationships. I'm going to talk to boyfriend more about it later, I cannot believe kids or a good hearted guy with dyslexia could actually be evil genius that understands how to intentionally gaslights to drive people crazy. It's like our narratives don't allign and that's where the gaslighting starts?"

She has been dropping alzeihmers hints for years!!! She is setting herself up to have abuse amnesia like what happened to you!!! I already suspected this was happening but thought it sounded a bit over the top and paranoid. She used to do the same thing with my journals as a kid too except she wouldn't bring them up as soon as she found them... She would just wait... biding her time until she wanted a comeback to shut you down if I ever stood up to her she would drop these facts and secrets she'd known the whole time and you could see her enjoying your reaction like she thought she was this all knowing god. Thank you so much for sharing. I needed to hear this <3 edit: and I agree. I treat my dog better than she ever treated her kids and I would never treat a kid like that least of all my own kids !!

I truly believe some of them are defective in the way of self serving memories and twisting reality to make them feel better about themselves and they really are capable of empathy but not in a healthy or assertive way?? My sister does the same thing. It's hard to tell when they're going to be bad or not. When they're good it feels really fake tho... EDIT: I think I'm doing the self serving memory thing myself wanting to see the best in her again bc I forgot she screamed at me to get out of her house (for doing something I wasn't doing but she wouldn't listen) even after the time I called her out. If she did/does regret kicking me out of her house she hasn't learned a thing... (she's done it three times twice bc of my appearence plus she's crazy and the last time was just bc she's crazy).

I was the scapegoat/the younger sister I believe my older sister understood that my parents were fucked up and didn't have the capacity to love both of us. I have some strange memories also where I really believe my nmom was lowkey trying to manipulate and scare her by favouring and making her jealous of me. My sister understood she must knock me off the podium and not much else. I was really confused by what was going on with this conditional manipulative love bombing.

I think it's all about projection I started shutting down emotionally when I was a teen and since I wouldn't talk and refused to play along with her abuse, she didn't like that so she started making her own conclusions about what my silence meant and what I was thinking (it was so gross she has no idea who I actually am and her crazy assumptions about what rule breaking she'd decided I was planning just showed how mischevious and depraved her own logic is) she actually was a horribly rebellious child that had kids too early and I was a perfectionist at the top of my class.

I have explained it to my partener as ""that feeling you get when your nightmares turning too bad and the intense anxiety/fear you get right before/after waking up from a nightmare"" but the real nightmare is reality and the truth of your trauma in waking life creeping back in as you start to wake up then reality and the anxiety/anger hits and your wide awake.

My nmom had no life and would go through my room and look for any contrband/ journals or anything to read while I was at school. If she found any journal entries or spicy dirt on us she would gossip about it to all her friends and then sit on it and only bring it up as an unexpected (irrelevant) comeback to scare us into submission if we tried to argue with her abuse. It was like blackmail. She would be visibly enjoying it as if she was an all knowing God. But she would portray to others that she was just a desperate mother locked out but still trying to connect with her teen daughter like it was an episode of friggeen Gilmore girls... She was a bad actor she never brought anything up in a healthy or genuine way being a spy was the only way she wanted to address parenting, eavesdropping constantly and even followed me around in public secretly.
My golden child sister would encourage her to avoid her wrath. She used to publicly bully me for reading Harry Potter as a child and would tell my high school friends about it to publicly shame and embarrass me. When she was 27 she read the books once then got a fucking Harry Potter tattoo and remembers herself as the biggest victim of the abuse and acts like I'm crazy."
raisedbynarcissists,foli7st,t1_folbp2j,1587862778.0,">When we get out into the world, they also make us more likely to fall into relationships with Ns, whether that's romantically, at work, friends, etc, because we don't see the red flags. Therapy for ACoNs is about learning how to see yourself as worthy of love and respect, and about how to develop boundaries so you don't repeat the same pattern over again as an adult.

This! I find for me who has cptsd as a result of an abusive childhood I am constantly being over sensitive/protective of others boundaries/feelings/triggers and to completely neglect my own (basically how my life got so fucked up). Predatory types can recognize this when you easily bend to their will and they will start expecting and demanding more the more you try to pacify their demands. Every single adult relationship I have had has been emotionally and physically abusive I have found myself in situations where I have been technically raped due to withdrawal of consent/lack of consent by different people on two occasions, the second guy I dated after he raped me (!?). For me I didn't find it very traumatic at the time or even call it what it was until years later. I think we need to bring more awareness to revictimization and why it happens. It's not as simple as that stupid story of the boy who cried wolf. Some victims have been raised as narcissistic supply, have been groomed and conditioned to get fucked over again and again and some people are just subhuman narcissistic predators actually seeking out easy victims. The rest is history."

Normal people do not understand and they think you are trying too hard to be convincing bc you must be a liar, and if your nparents have tried to throw the ""liar"" tag out there to get themselves some backup it will almost always seem that way to others on the outside. Though they have probably convinced themselves that you are the liar, do they have innaccurate recollections and self inflating narratives of the past which are totally fabricated/twisted to make themselves seem perfect? I know this is something most humans do unconsciously and their memory becomes self serving. I feel like I am constantly questioning my own memory to make sure I'm not doing that crazy fantasy shit bc I see that as the REAL compulsive lying (or narcissism) tbh. This was how I broke out of that lie of me being the problem/scapegoat (not that I would recommend it bc it takes so much time and energy out of your life to soul search for that undeniable truth that you are sane and speaking truth and to prove the fact.)

I still can't exactly  explain where the defining lines between covert narcs and people who are just portraying addopted behaviour they're conditioned with without using scenarios/examples just yet but what you said was really informative and honest and I believe that is just it. True empathy, self awareness and the ability to love is what separates us from them.

raisedbynarcissists,fm75sx5,t3_ftgn1n,1585814313.0,It might be that your sis understood to an extent that your parents didn't have the capacity to show love to both of you while the other becomes SG. Maybe she got jealous of what you had and wanted to be on the other side or she became better adapted to pacifying their narcissism and hence why she's probably inherited their traits. I have a similar dynamic to you and I think in a way we are at least realizing and learning from their toxicity and not unconciously addopt their behaviour through conditioning like some of the golden children. I hope things keep getting better for you
