Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fqydy91,t3_fkrksn,1589747037.0,"Hey guys ... I just found out my dad is temporarily moving out since the COVID situation at his work is continuing to get worse. My mum and I both have autoimmune conditions, and he is doing this to keep us safe, but it just really sucks.

He usually works out of the house 5-6 days a week and is away overnight a lot, but it is going to be very strange with him not coming home throughout the week and/or on the weekends.

I guess I am posting here 'cause I'm feeling kinda sad & don't really have anybody to talk to about this. I appreciate that he is making an effort to keep my mum and I protected, but it still really sucks that this is our current reality."

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fqycowq,t1_fqy6b28,1589746452.0,"Ok! So I have combination skin I guess - it is pretty dry but also gets pretty oily during the day/while I am sleeping.

I have a TON of very small breakouts underneath (?) my skin that just never seem to come to a head & they make my skin look spotty, especially if you are up close. 

I still get some pretty big & angry zits pretty consistently as well. I am currently using a sea salt scrub from LUSH about once a week & I also am using the Biore charcoal face wash daily. I do use a teatree toner, but that is almost gone so I need to find a new one. My moisturizer is Cerave, but I am thinking that I need to switch to something different as I don't think it is helping with the oily issues if that makes any sense?"
