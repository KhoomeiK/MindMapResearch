It lasted a couple of months for me, with constant extreme hunger, where I needed to inhale food all day long. Eventually there were less and less days like this.

And now I eat like 3-4 meals a day and am satisfied. Once and far in between I still get these days, but usually when I haven’t had time to eat enough or something (eating less without intentionally restricting)

You have to eat the food you are craving and not fill up on safe food or low cal substitutes. And eat as much as your body is asking you for. One day you will feel satiation again. I know it is a nerve-wrecking phase of recovery but you gotta keep pushing through!

fuckeatingdisorders,fikfpzf,t3_f8802g,1582479491.0,"Hi, I consider myself pretty much recovered from anorexia and I know how exhausting and nerve wrecking the recovery process can be. 

I experienced weight gain from eating >!1500!< kcal a day when starting recovery as well as extreme hunger, constant food thoughts, bloating, gastroparesis, reactive blood sugar, etc, etc. All of this is common in recovery. But I would recommend you to keep track of your health and vitals together with your GP to be on the safe side of things. Especially if increasing from below 2000 kcal a day in case of refeeding syndrome, which can be very dangerous. 

In regards to weight gain on “maintenance intake”, I had been feeding my body so little, that it would cling to and store any calories it could get. Only when I responded to my extreme hunger over time, my body would be able to also repair the damage that had been done from restriction, in addition to storing it. Only then I would see my vitals improve significantly, and my body start to heal properly. 

From what you are writing it seems pretty clear to me you are still not feeding yourself properly. Your body is scared there will be an other famine, so it stores all it can. It will likely stay metabolically suppressed until you eat as much as your extreme hunger asks you for and as long as it asks you for it. Restricting and purging will only make the progress longer and the extreme hunger last longer.

Even though it feels terrifying, you have to let yourself eat till satiation (or the closest you can come to it with extreme hunger). It is the way humans/animals naturally recover from starvation. By eating lots and lots of food. I easily ate everything between >!4-6000!< kcal when I gave in to my extreme hunger. (You may need more.) Every day for months. And I went cold turkey on exercise. Of course I gained weight quicker when increasing my intake, but after about 4 months my weight gain slowed down and my appetite diminished. And I was able to think about more interesting things than food all day. I couldn’t eat as much in a day today as I did in a day following my extreme hunger in recovery. 

And this is not about reaching a normal BMI range. You have to make up for the energy deficit your body has gone through. You may still have “energy debt” to make up for even when you have reached a normal BMI. Your body decides when you are ‘weight restored’ enough to not be hungry all the time. And I know it is brutal and terrifying but you have to accept that if you want to fully recover. 

I hope reading this didn’t discourage you, and I really hope you resist the urge to relapse. To me, recovery was absolutely worth it. You deserve a life free from eating disorders. Recovery from anorexia is one of the- if not THE toughest thing I have ever done, and I wish you all the strength to get through this. It helped me a lot to watch/read blogposts and videos from Tabitha Farrar and Kayla Rose. It made it easier to give myself permission to eat and to reassure myself that I was on the right path. Maybe you can find some support there too. 

All the best <3"

ac_newhorizons,fejfjv0,t3_epcb1e,1579171773.0,"TW: Eating disorder, self harm

I often find myself playing AC in times of loneliness, with little structure and a lot of worries. I have been struggling with self harm since I was 12. I always had difficult time making and keeping friends. I have been hospitalized many times, both in somatic and psychiatric hospital. AC has been with me through times of loneliness and isolation. But most markedly in my struggle with my eating disorder. 

I found that NL was one of the very few non-eating-disordered things I could do and still get some sort of happiness from. Or maybe it just satisfied my hunter-gatherer instinct, lol. At my worst, I spent whole days carefully weighing and making low cal “meals” which I would spend 1-2 hours eating, while either looking up recipes and food, reading nutrition info, calculating calories, or playing NL. I was very lonely and isolated. I shut the few people I had around out of my life so that I could just do all these messed up lengthy eating rituals of mine. 

I was eventually hospitalized a couple times, as my heart was starting to give out, and eventually I was admitted to psych ward again. I brought NL with me every time. 

As I started uni, while trying to recover, I also brought NL with me. I have always struggled to make friends, and now having an ED on top of that really didn’t help. In the lunch break I would go to a little cafe, order some tea, and eat my meticulously calculated lunch and play NL. I didn’t really mind being alone with only my safe foods and NL, cause food was all my mind wanted to me to focus on. Eventually it became clear I couldn’t focus on school and needed time to just focus on repairing my relationship with food and weight restoration. So I had to quit uni. 

I kept playing NL during recovery. I would treat myself Saturday nights listening to K.K. Slider. As I recovered more, I eventually didn’t play NL as often as every day any more. I feel NL helped me have a sense of structure when I needed it the most and made me feel less lonely. I feel it helped me calm down during the stress of eating. Now as I’m starting uni again I’m hoping this year will be better for me. At least I have NH to look forward to, haha."
