For cost... my psychiatrist was in-network but still cost $160 per session until I met my (rather high) deductible, which sucked. How often I saw her depended on how I was doing at any given time - varied from every two weeks to every three months.

Therapy was $120/session and I ended up seeing someone who was in private practice ie didn‚Äôt directly participate in insurance.

I usually just call my dads wife my stepmom even though I was in my 20s when she came into the picture. She introduces me mostly as ‚ÄúDave‚Äôs daughter‚Äù but sometimes stepdaughter. It‚Äôs just easier even though she obviously doesn‚Äôt have a real motherly role in my life. Consistently referring to her as ‚ÄúDads wife‚Äù is just clunky and implies a tense relationship which isn‚Äôt true. If we didn‚Äôt get along then I could easily see it being a different story.

I don‚Äôt call her kids my stepbrother or stepsister though."
EDAnonymous,feg7idb,t1_feg3mp5,1579080687.0,"My personal experience: I have been at a point in recovery where I had no food or weight thoughts at all, it was not a daily battle or something really lurking in the background. I kinda like the term ‚Äúin remission‚Äù , personally. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve ever thought of myself as ‚ÄúrecoverED‚Äù because it kinda implies it‚Äôs 100% cured and will not recur.

mentalhealth,fe7trq5,t3_eo1kbe,1578919150.0,"I‚Äôve gone to the ER directly for admission and a crisis clinic for assessment that ultimately ended in an admission. 

If you‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre not in imminent danger of suicide You could look for a psychiatrist and therapist first, they can help assess where you‚Äôre at and if hospitalization is necessary or would be helpful. Also hopefully could point you in the direction of a *good* psychiatric unit. My first stay was unhelpful at a shitty hospital/unit but the only open bed my insurance would approve. The second stay was much better and saved my life.

You‚Äôd definitely need a diagnosis for disability and maybe even a history of trying various treatment options. I‚Äôm not sure how it all works as I‚Äôve not filed for it but some people I met in treatment said it‚Äôs difficult to get approved for a mental health basis."
EDanonymemes,fe6l90v,t1_fe6gbfe,1578894649.0,"never involuntarily hospitalized, to be clear. but the times i was talking about in my comment were for depression/suicide. i was inpatient twice for that. first time, i took an uber to the hospital after i made an impulsive suicide attempt and the second time was when i was sent for a crisis assessment by my PHP therapist and agreed to an admission. it seemed like they had staff blocking the hallway when they came to check on my decision which is why i suspected they would‚Äôve admitted me involuntarily if i hadn‚Äôt agreed to go, but i did agree. 

and i was inpatient once for the ed but that was definitely 100% voluntary, i went in for an assessment with a local treatment center. i was underweight but not shockingly so, no dangerous medical issues aside from like bradycardia and the usual.

EDIT sorry if this is a general question, i didn‚Äôt answer as such. but yeah. I met a person in my first treatment program who was not allowed to leave when she came in for her assessment bc her weight was so low. It‚Äôs probably easier to forcibly admit someone in some states than others, I heard it was definitely more of a thing in Colorado for example."

EDanonymemes,fe65r5j,t1_fe5ysj1,1578882406.0,"Highly depends on the therapist. I was horribly depressed and suicidal and neither my therapist or psychiatrist forced me in. My therapist just asked ‚Äúshould I walk you over to the hospital?‚Äù once but let me leave on my own after the session. Then I did eventually make a suicide attempt lol 

Now I doubt providers would give me the same leeway knowing that history. A couple months later in PHP I did have a therapist request I go to the crisis center to be evaluated when I said something like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be happy about what I did last night‚Äù in context of having a bad depression night but I don‚Äôt *think* they would have forced me... The evaluators at the center recommended inpatient and I‚Äôm 90% sure THEY weren‚Äôt going to let me walk out lol but honestly it was a helpful admission and I believe the doctor there saved my life. 

TBH I had decided I‚Äôd never let myself be involuntarily hospitalized because it would mean I wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to buy a gun in my state and what if I wanted that option for suicide? Hahah (I‚Äôm fine now dw, this was 2015)"

I will agree with your ex about letting him make his own choices and fail on his own. My brother had a shotgun wedding after he got his gf of 3 months pregnant and we all had our doubts/discomforts but showed up. Figured he was in his 20s (23 I think) and gets to make his own choices even when we think they‚Äôre bad. 

My unrequested suggestion: Offer to get the kid some damn therapy. God knows minimum wage isn‚Äôt going to cover it. He isn‚Äôt progressing in life according to your standards and maybe he will never get on the pathway you want him to be on but he‚Äôs certainly capable of being a more productive and healthy human being and therapy can help him get there.
