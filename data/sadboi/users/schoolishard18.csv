AnorexiaNervosa,fp8l975,t3_ga7f00,1588395312.0,"I totally understand why you feel like this because I felt like this too, before I was hospitalized, and it was nothing like I thought it would be. I was put on a floor with a bunch of really old people and I wasn’t treated like a real human being, I was treated like a patient that no one really knew how to deal with because they aren’t used to dealing with psychiatric illnesses on a general medical ward. I had someone in my room 24/7 and had to leave the door wide open when I was in the bathroom or showering. I was on strict bedrest and would get called out even if I was stretching in my bed. I had no help on the mental illness aspect so I was expected to eat 6 times a day (or I would get a feeding tube) yet was given no help or strategies on how to deal with the anxiety and depression that came along with eating."
AnorexiaNervosa,fkvycjs,t3_fkyzg1,1584579345.0,I feel this. I dread going to bed every night because I know I am going to have to go through another day living by my ED rules. I want to be free from it so badly.
AnorexiaNervosa,fksxk8o,t1_fksqk8i,1584500780.0,"Thank you, yeah I have been going one day at a time. My mom has been really helpful with all of this but since she’s my mom and sees how much I am struggling she doesn’t push me that hard to complete my meals. My goal is to keep eating enough to stay medically stable until I can get into the program. It’s definitely a hard time for everyone right now and I hope it won’t go on for too long."
AnorexiaNervosa,fksvzus,t1_fksq0hz,1584499700.0,Thank you for this I will definitely have to try it!
AnorexiaNervosa,fj5kiut,t3_fbm5ec,1583035010.0,I don’t know how to provide the help you need but I am struggling with this as well. I feel like I could have written this post. My ED has been freaking out because I am now weight restored and I don’t know how to navigate the guilt I get every time I eat a meal or a snack. It’s so exhausting.
AnorexiaNervosa,fehh6vu,t3_ep0sdy,1579116457.0,Congrats!! This is encouraging to read as I am on day 2 of my first hospitalization. It’s nice to see the positive side of recovery. Keep it up 💕
AnorexiaNervosa,fehcc25,t1_fegsfwr,1579113635.0,"Yeah I seem to do breakfast without much anxiety, but by the time lunch comes around I have to force myself to eat and then dinner I opted to have a boost meal replacement drink instead of the actual food because the thought of chewing food again was too much. It’s definitely hard because my ED voice is so loud right now so I just have to keep pushing past it. Congrats on your recovery, hopefully as more time passes the anxiety will continue to go down. Thanks for the reply. 💕"
AnorexiaNervosa,fehbunl,t1_fegfzd0,1579113350.0,I’m super anxious for when my meals start to get bigger already. Because right now I’m only receiving 3 meals a day and it only totals to ~1200 calories to avoid refeeding and those meals already feel so big. But comments like this really help me push through and see the positives 💕
AnorexiaNervosa,fehbkzx,t1_feg05w7,1579113192.0,"Thank you so much for taking the time to write this all out! That is such a good way of thinking about it. I have a similar set up, I have a meal and then a Boost drink on the side and whatever I don’t eat has to be made up by drinking a certain amount of the boost. I found dinner the hardest because I felt like I had already had too much food that day (even though my meals are super small to start with) and so I found the boost really helpful cause there is no chewing involved. I didn’t realize the town that I live in doesn’t really have a proper ED inpatient program because I’m the youngest person on my floor and 96% of the other people are 80+ years old so it’s quite isolating. Then for meals I have a nurse come sit with me through the meal and an hour afterwards. Luckily the nurse I have is incredibly nice. But it makes it hard not having anyone going through the same thing as me. But thanks for the kind words 💕"
AnorexiaNervosa,feeypab,t1_feer36d,1579044135.0,"Thank you for these supportive words! I will definitely need to keep reminding myself of this everyday.

AnorexiaNervosa,feeyexz,t1_fe6lnvq,1579043951.0,"I luckily didn’t have to get an NG tube.

Thanks! :)"
AnorexiaNervosa,feey2ag,t1_feetrtu,1579043723.0,"Thanks for the positive words! Yeah I got woken up at 5:50 to get my vitals done. Found out I have to get blood tests done everyday as well luckily needles don’t bother me, I couldn’t imagine being I  your position and having to get pokes everyday. 

Yeah my meals are pretty small and I’m not allowed snacks yet to avoid refeeding syndrome. The hardest is being on bedrest because of how much I was exercising prior. 

But I just have to keep taking this day by day and hope it will get easier the longer I am here."
AnorexiaNervosa,fe64vs3,t1_fe5m1mb,1578881841.0,"Thanks for taking the time to write all of this out. It’s so weird going into something  so blindly. Also I don’t live near my family and my friends are pretty busy with their university classes so I am going to be doing a lot of this alone which will make it harder for sure so hopefully bringing some of my own blankets and stuff will help a little. Thanks for the ear plug and laundry detergent I wouldn’t of though to bring those. 

I’m already on medication for depression, adhd and then one that helps both my insomnia and anxiety so I am pretty open to taking what they think is best for me. 

Thanks for all this insight especially the last Part about really focusing on recovery and not letting the ED voice run too rampant. <3"
AnorexiaNervosa,fe61yz7,t1_fe5m7vq,1578879977.0,"Thanks so much for taking the time to write all of this out. I think I’ll head to the store tomorrow and get a couple books and things to keep me distracted. I’ve had to put graduating university this year on hold because of my ED and when I started to really see how much of my life it is taking from me has given me enough motivation to make this step. 

I am really hoping this will help me see the benefits of getting proper nutrition and help with that initial step into a long road of recovery. 

Thanks again for the advice!"

I only know I’m too skinny because of the scale or the size of my clothes but I truly can’t see what other people see because of body dysmorphia.

AnorexiaNervosa,fdpgxmz,t1_fdp9d74,1578628336.0,"I think I worded it wrong because I totally agree. I was more looking to hear what the hospital is like just because I have no idea. I would never just base it off of what I read here. 

My doctor and I decided to not send me today but I’m going to call her office tomorrow and asked to be processed through. Thanks for the bluntness"

AnorexiaNervosa,fdn4n47,t1_fddepxq,1578577153.0,That is comforting to hear that I am not the only one. Best of luck to you!
AnorexiaNervosa,fdn4kxo,t1_fddet9l,1578577104.0,Thanks for this! It’s definitely hard to see any change in my body and can be so discouraging and triggering when trying to refeed. I’ll keep this in mind. Thank you

AnorexiaNervosa,fdfaxkc,t1_fddijdo,1578357409.0,I was getting worried about that so I have really been trying this past month to not use laxatives at all. I wouldn’t be surprised if that is what is happening.
AnorexiaNervosa,fdf6zk2,t3_ekz5v3,1578354752.0,I was feeling gross and huge when I was shopping  and tried on a size of pants that I haven’t been since grade 6 (I’m 22 now) and they were loose in the waist. It’s crazy what the mind can do.
AnorexiaNervosa,fddaxfq,t1_fdd8uh9,1578303233.0,I think it is cause I have been at home for the holidays so I’ve been having to eat more than I normally do when I live alone. It just worries me because I’m starting up with a dietitian this week and am worried my fear of bloating is going to hinder the recovery process. thanks for the insight!!
AnorexiaNervosa,fd6h8r5,t3_ek1yt5,1578190983.0,This happened to me with VS and other professional models that I follow on Instagram. I used to think they were so tiny and what I wanted to look like now they look like a normal weight and some even look chubby to me.

AnorexiaNervosa,fbzju13,t3_ef29vy,1577249116.0,"I relate to this way too much. I was just starting at an ED clinic before I left and was motivated to start sticking to a meal plan. But then I got home and the first day I was at my lowest weight ever. At my apartment at university I only have my safe foods in the kitchen so I never eat anything like candy or baked goods. But since being home I have been eating so much food. I just feel so out of control. My stomach feels like in a bottomless pit. It makes me feel so disgusting especially how bloated I am. 

But just remember to be kind to yourself during this time. Good luck and happy holidays :)"
AnorexiaNervosa,fbzj6pw,t3_efaix2,1577248489.0,I don’t think I have stoped eating since this afternoon. I just feel like my stomach is a bottomless pit because I have eaten more than anyone and I could still eat more. I am letting myself eat today and tomorrow and deal with the consequences on the 26th. 🙃
AnorexiaNervosa,fbzj2in,t1_fbyedcg,1577248375.0,Yes it’s such a weird disorder and so hard to explain to people. Like I had to tell my mom that everyone acting like I am fine and looking good is the exact opposite of what they should say because it makes me feel fat or “not sick enough”. Which I know I am but I struggle to get out of the mindset.
AnorexiaNervosa,fbnl8do,t3_edqd54,1576999507.0,"Relating to this so much tonight. Just got home for the holidays and had a big family dinner. My uncle is a chef and so all the food was amazing and I did my best to “turn off” my ED I had a lot smaller portions than everyone else, and I couldn’t help but envy everyone of them, they all just sat and talked and enjoyed their food. I was so in my head estimating how many calories I was eating and how much butter or cream was in things. I then left shortly after dinner because my ed told me I had to go workout to get rid of the calories. Everyone else stayed late socializing and having a great time. I just want that, yet everyday I find it harder and harder to ignore or over rule my ed voice. It is honestly so exhausting, anxiety inducing and isolating living like this everyday. 

I hope things start to turn around for you, even if it’s just small steps at a time. :)"
AnorexiaNervosa,falxi34,t1_faiyb19,1576192157.0,"Yes this did help!! I was just letting my ED and anxiety run my brain yesterday. I went crazy searching up reviews on the internet after I got home from the pharmacy and read so many things about people having major weight gain and so that cause me to spiral. 

After reading your comment I decided to just try it because I was so desperate for a good sleep so I wanted to just see what it was like. And I got an amazing sleep, only took like 15 minutes to fall asleep which is a huge change from my usual 3-4 hours. 

I think he didn’t mention it because he put me on such a low dosage that I probably wouldn’t have to worry of that side effect, but I just wish now he would’ve explained that it is a side effect but only on usually happens for people on high dosages. Would’ve avoided all my anxiety yesterday. 

Thanks for the input! :)"
AnorexiaNervosa,falwxiv,t1_falwedl,1576191879.0,Yeah I definitely think it was just my anxiety around it. When I was reading about it online there were a lot of people who said it caused a lot of weight gain. But I was put on a super low dosage so I think that is why he didn’t mention it. I’m so irrotational when it comes to weight gain because I’m at the very start of treatment.
AnorexiaNervosa,f8znt57,t3_e2pbid,1574962876.0,When your body is being starved it will save the little nutrients it has to keep your vital organs working properly which means it won’t waste in on your hair so it will start to fall out.
AnorexiaNervosa,f8rq51o,t3_e1s443,1574748459.0,"I had been seeing a therapist for 8 months and she was helping me with my ADHD, depression and anxiety. When I started to noticeably lose weight she asked me what my relationship with food was like. I was honest and told her that it wasn’t good but also told her I didn’t want to lose anymore weight and become super skinny. After a few more weeks of seeing her I kept dropping in weight and had started heavy restriction and compulsive exercise. Because she doesn’t work with any ED patients she made the decision to refer me to a specialist and help me find a doctor to see. 

The specialist I see for my ED doesn’t push me to gain weight as she understands the complexity of it and I need to be seeing a dietitian and have a proper meal plan. However during my sessions with her we talk about ways in which I can try to increase my food intake and how to get past the anxiety around it and understanding the purpose of my disorder. 

I realized how seriously mental health professionals take ED because my old counsellor and my new counsellor communicate over the phone about my progress and the next steps. They also both communicate with my doctor to make sure she is in the loop with everything as well."
ADHD,f8rp9te,t3_e1l9fy,1574747525.0,I had to drop a university class because the lab portion of the class was too overwhelming.

AnorexiaNervosa,f8accmb,t3_dz477h,1574393404.0,I relate to this so much. I’ve never loved meat but I also have never been vegetarian or vegan. But since struggling with my ED I will only eat vegan food. I will even eat a semi normal amount of food if someone takes me to a vegan restaurant but I feel like I can justify it to myself because in my head they are healthier calories than eating something with animal products in it.

AnorexiaNervosa,f7iq73w,t3_dw58q9,1573763740.0,"Yes, they trigger me a lot but I can’t admit it to anyone or I will sound like a bitch. My biggest struggle is the person I live with eats really unhealthy, like cookies, ice cream, candy and fast food. I have seen her gain weight over the past couple months and it makes me feel like I have to restrict more. Also,I was at yoga the other day and the person next to me was overweight and I couldn’t focus on the class at all because I was so bothered by how big she was. I feel horrible for thinking this way though."
ADHD,f7axkmn,t3_duzt57,1573544677.0,Too relatable. One time before a therapy appointment I sent my therapist an email on something I wanted to talk about my next session as I could never bring it up in person. She was amazed by how good of a writer I was and that I was able to get my point across so clearly. I think she was mostly amazed because I can be so awkward and unclear when I explain things verbally in session.
AnorexiaNervosa,f6b8wci,t3_dqtgvz,1572770301.0,"I felt this same way once I sought out professional help and started opening up to my parents and a couple close friends. I felt like I had to “prove” to them that I was truly sick enough to be anorexic. 

I told this to my counsellor that things have been getting a lot worse since I started looking into residential treatments and she said that it is very common for people with eating disorders to start to deteriorate once seeking out proper help and support."
EatingDisorders,f6aqzsa,t3_dq1wpz,1572761088.0,I was having the same worries and went to multiple walk in clinics and they all said that since my blood pressure and heart rate are still in normal range I am still okay for now but if I ever blackout from it I need to go get checked at the hospital. But they also said it can also be due to electrolyte imbalance so it’s good to get blood work done.
EatingDisorders,f54avve,t3_dmhkpq,1571976109.0,"I have felt like I have faked each one of my diagnosis. I still question my ADHD diagnosis even though it has been confirmed by 2 psychiatrists and a therapist that specializes in ADHD. I questioned my anxiety/panic disorder until I was having a full blown panic attack and ended up calling an ambulance because I thought I was dying. I questioned my depression until I was hospitalized for a few nights in the psychiatric unit. I now have 2 counsellors working together to try to get me into a proper inpatient treatment facility for my ED yet I still feel like I’m faking my ED and don’t get why they are trying so hard to get me into a clinic. 

I find that because I feel like I am faking this disorder is more harmful because I’m trying to prove that I have one by trying to make myself as sick as possible."
dpdr,f0unv4v,t1_f0nzk0u,1568945727.0,"Thanks! Yeah I definitely still have a lot of work to go. Dealing with this or any mental illness definitely means you can’t live the same as a lot of people who don’t struggle. I have to make sure I am keeping up with my self care everyday and seeing a counsellor once a week and just being aware of what I need to not spiral. 

But my friends have been helping me for almost a year now, before this I was struggling with depression and anxiety that was constantly giving me panic attacks. They have been with me through all of it but I was starting to be too much on their own mental health. But I needed that wake up call."
dpdr,f0un22e,t1_f0o2zrd,1568945101.0,There is no one solution for this. But what I meant was just keep fighting back and trying different things.

dpdr,f0umvki,t1_f0oa8fh,1568944961.0,Yeah I have never cared to keep up with my workouts because I was in a negative mindset and convinced myself nothing was going to help it. Amazing what determination and sticking to a plan can do.

Then out of frustration of dealing with this I told myself I would start pushing myself in therapy and not hold anything back anymore. I’m still not near being better but I am finally feeling like some progress is being made, the other day in therapy I actually felt anxiety make my chest heavy. I quickly dissociated more and the feeling went away but the fact that I even felt it made my therapist and me happy."
dpdr,eymcerx,t3_cxar9q,1567205160.0,I don’t get it all the time but when I’m in an environment or situation that raises my anxiety I get the splotchy and blurry visuals. Yesterday in therapy my therapist is really pushing me to feel my emotions when they come. So when I started to feel anxious she made me try to feel it and when I focused on it everything went blurry and fuzzy and then the feeling of anxiety and heavy breathing went away.
dpdr,eymc7ko,t1_eyljrfc,1567205003.0,"This is so accurate. I luckily have a friend that has been dealing with this for years before me and being able to talk to someone who understands is amazing. All of my other friends and family just don’t understand it. My mom is constantly asking if I’m better because I seem fine. Yet she doesn’t see that living inside my head everyday is hell. Some days worse than others but I have no normal days anymore. It got so bad that my therapist was contemplating sending me to the hospital because of how hopeless I was and how I kept saying that I give up. The absolute worst part of it for me is the inability to be numb emotionally and physically, I start going crazy every night just wanting some escape even just for 10 minutes."
dpdr,ey9t1fn,t3_cwbg0e,1566951817.0,Yeah my brain has gone completely blank which is a 180 turn since I also have ADHD and so prior to this my brain was super active. It’s probably the most distressing part of the dpdr for me.

dpdr,exeatsn,t3_cs71co,1566206973.0,"I’m 21 and have been experiencing dpdr 24/7 for the past 4 months. 

1) It has definitely made me more distant towards my friends however I really make an effort to fake it some days so I wouldn’t say that many of my friends have been that affected by it. Although that is coming from my perspective just because they haven’t said anything yet. 

2) I find it really difficult to feel close to people because I don’t feel any strong emotion or emotional connection to anyone anymore. It’s even a struggle with people I was previously really close with to feel that same connection to them anymore. 

3) I don’t feel that uncomfortable to open up to people but that is because I don’t really have that emotional pull back of vulnerability. Before this happened I had difficulty opening up to my therapist about some issues and now I am a lot more likely because I won’t feel that level of embarrassment that used to hold me back and after the appointment I will forget the emotions connected to what I had said in therapy anyway. 

4) I have a family that I have always loved dearly and a sister I was super close with. That is all gone now, like I know logically that I love them but now I don’t  feel the emotional aspect of love towards them. Same for my friends as well, I will act the way I used to and say I miss them or love them however I do not feel that emotionally towards them. 

5) I can logically empathize on things I know I would normally empathize on prior to this, but again no internal emotional response. So I guess that makes it harder so show genuine empathy. 

6) on my bad days I do isolate myself a lot more, and I distance myself in the way that I am no longer good at communicating via text/social media, or some days I am just too mentally exhausted to hangout with anyone. 

7) I find that even though I don’t have emotional responses anymore I still know what emotions I used to feel towards an event/thing/person so I will fake an appropriate emotional response. 

8) this may be person to person but I personally hate being touched (innocent touching, e.g hug) since it has happened. My Memory, timeline of recent past events, and concept of time is very poor as well."

Panic disorder: yeah you have overthought the shit out of everything, time for a panic attack so bad that you end up in the hospital.

When my mom talked to my teacher she told her that I am smart enough but I’m too “spacey” in class and if I just focused more she would’ve recommended me for the honours classes.

Now that it is constant and I never get out of it anymore I am just starting to learn how to live with it, and I am becoming used to it. It definitely makes doing summer school harder. But like whenever there are embarrassing moments that I used to think about over and over again leaves my head/thought process after like 10 minutes. It’s definitely still uncomfortable but sometimes peaceful to not be so worried about what other people think of me. However I am going to counselling 2 times a week to try to get rid of it because I don’t think that it is a good way to actually handle emotions and situations and I still want to be able to feel emotions again."
Anxiety,etysnk1,t3_ccfwf7,1563322156.0,"I had a bad anxiety attack a few weeks back, I was also extremely depressed but I ended up in the hospital for a few nights. For about 2 weeks after I was in a constant state of dissociation (depersonalization/de realization), and then I got out of it for a few days but I am finding that any situation that raises my anxiety level in the slightest pulls me back into dissociation. The dissociation sometimes lasts for 5-12hours even when I try grounding techniques. Once I get out of it I feel like I am walking on egg shells trying to avoid any anxiety inducing situation to avoid falling back into the dissociation."
ADHD,etnqwo2,t3_ccat8e,1562996687.0,"I had a pimple on my face that wasn’t going away so I went online to look at any products I could get to help breakouts. Next thing I know it was 5:30am, I had learned all about dermatology, and since I’m in organic chemistry right now I even started learning about the chemistry that goes into making skin care products, what chemical ingredients to avoid, what chemical ingredients are the best and how the chemical structures effect how they work. I then researched all the products I wanted. 2 days later I had no interest in it at all."
ADHD,et4xiii,t3_c9wbpx,1562459593.0,Only mental health professionals that I felt heard with have adhd themselves. The reason why I like my counsellor so much is because she has adhd.
ADHD,esr486c,t3_c8xtxr,1562216174.0,"Got diagnosed at 21, I was going into my 3rd year of university and had already failed 2 classes, switched my degree 2 times hoping something would click. So for my first 3 years I was mainly in 100 level classes which were easy enough to pass, but once I got into 200/300 level courses I realized how hard it was to study, and how ineffective my studying was I would study for an midterm for 2 days and barely pass. I was so frustrated because I always knew I was smarter than what I was putting on paper I always felt “stuck” in my head because of how foggy I always was."
ADHD,esq2q1c,t3_c8twea,1562194428.0,"21, no matter how badly I wanted to just sit down and study for my classes I couldn’t, and because of how forgetful I am."
ADHD,esaaqz0,t3_c6ovik,1561755428.0,"I tried for a long time to cope with the thoughts and feelings of suicidal ideation and anxiety. I was diagnosed in November (20F) January I stared getting panic attacks. And fell into depression in March. I went to counselling and was pretty aware of trying to stay on top of my mental health issues. However that did not work I ended up having an extreme agitation anxiety attack. Resulting in being brought to the hospital and checked into the psychiatric ward, I have now started antidepressants. 

Long story short, if you constantly try to run away from your struggles with depression and anxiety they will come up eventually and even harder. Not saying antidepressants is the only answer I just was no longer taking care of myself. Was barely sleeping, not eating much and I thought I could just keep going. So just be very aware when things are declining too much and seek out the help you need."
depression,esa8hoa,t1_es8iqip,1561753940.0,"Was thinking the same thing. I just got out of the psychiatric unit i was in the hospital for 2 days and an ambulance ride to get me there. I only have to pay for my ambulance ride which is $80. Luckily I still have my parents insurance so my medication is all covered too.
Edit: I live in Canada"
ADHD,es599yp,t3_c5yz2l,1561604855.0,When I first got diagnosed I was really open about telling my friends about thinking they would all be supportive yeah I learned my lesson with that. I now just keep it to myself. Luckily I have an amazing counsellor who validates how hard adhd actually is.
ADHD,es51typ,t3_c5ljkr,1561599640.0,"This is me all the time. I got frustrated with my friends because I always tell them everything and they don’t share much with me. They then reminded me it’s because I never stop talking and feel the need to tell them everything. The worst part is, the stuff I share are embarrassing stories about myself that a normal person would want to keep quiet about. It entertains them at least."
ADHD,es4y5gz,t3_c5qdg1,1561596985.0,Yes and I always saw it as a good trait because I just saw it as being super helpful and caring to other people. But after being diagnosed with adhd and having a counsellor to talk things through with made me realize it’s because I have such low self-esteem and have had such difficulties making friends in university that I think if I just act in a way I think they would like and bend over backwards to help them that they will stay friends with me. Had to come to the hard realization that acting like that just results in them using me when they need something and that’s about it.
ADHD,erzn98f,t3_c4to7s,1561442199.0,I have an Apple Watch and I am very back and forth with using it. It’s great for when I’m just doing day to day stuff as I get all my notifications to it so I don’t find myself checking my phone as often which helps me not get distracted by it as much. Also great for tracking my heart rate with my medication. I’m a student so the only times I don’t use it is while I’m studying/doing homework because if it is homework I’m not overly interested in I find the notifications can cause me to become too distracting. However sometimes if I am having a really hard time getting focused with school work I turn it on aeroplane mode so I can’t get notifications and use it as a timer to motivate myself to work in 20 minute increments.
ADHD,eqz1g5c,t3_bzw7qn,1560392523.0,"I found my nauseous associated to food left after consistently being on Vyvanse for a few weeks (appetite is still suppressed but don’t feel nauseous when I force myself to eat). But until the nauseous left I had a lot of smoothies and made sure to add lots of spinach to them, and also protein bars and some days I could do oatmeal."
