In my quest to regain my former self I quit the soda and drank only water and coffee. I shed 20 lbs but I'm stalled. I am also craving sweets which I never had in the past. I actually bought diet Pepsi yesterday and have thought perhaps it was satisfying my sweet tooth all this time. I had been concerned it would cause me to crave sugar and that's why I quit. Perhaps it was helping me maintain a normal weight after all.
