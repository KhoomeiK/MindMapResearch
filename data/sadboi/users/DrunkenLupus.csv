That being said, the show is just like Cops, overdramatized and blown out of proportion. The arrests being made although are very real and I have mad respect for officers like this.

Fun tidbit: that is actually not a police officer, on the back of his vest it reads “Ordningsvakt” which roughly translates to “order-guard”. They are a few levels below police and don’t carry firearms like a regular PO. They are very common at sports events, concerts and public transport locations like in the clip."

I’m saying this as a person from Sweden. In my experience, the government is doing *nothing*. Stores are doing more than the government, placing disinfectant and plastic gloves by the entrances. All the stores are still open, you can still go to restaurants and bars. There is NO push to make more masks. Their only advice is “wash your hands and be safe”
