It took me until the beginning of senior year to fight off the internal homophobia and come out to myself as bi, though. I still haven't even fully come out except for to some close friends, but in hindsight I've been attracted to men and women the same amount of time.

I play banjo and it means a lot to me that i play. My family has a long history in our local bluegrass scene. Terrapin Station has been my favorite song for years and has gotten me through a lot of tough times. My first Dead-centric show was Lockn 2017 when Phil and Bobby and the TFB played Terrapin Station in full, and it was what made me realize this was a life long trip on the bus. I got this tattoo to remind me for my whole life that theres a group of people out there called DeadHeads that are (excluding you) accepting and kind even when no one else is to me. I dont care if it's a generic tattoo. I thought the artist did a superb job and I wanted to show it to some friendly people, that's all."
