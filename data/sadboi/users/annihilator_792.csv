someone once sat to eat opposite to me. there was lots of space everywhere else. maybe he just didn't want to eat alone because other people would think he's lonely, like me.

also in one class there was a shy girl and she had a (assumingly) boyfriend. i heard him complain how she wouldn't hang out with his friends and she just sat there quiet. that was relatable although i'll never know how she really felt."
