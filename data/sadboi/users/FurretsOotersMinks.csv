badwomensanatomy,fqarnh8,t1_fqaegpd,1589224100.0,"I want to add that you don't need to have a period with birth control pills. The ""period"" experienced is withdrawal bleeding from the lack of hormones and isn't a true period. If you skip the placebos and take the normal, active pills throughout the year, you can effectively ""skip"" periods. It doesn't hurt you to do so, the uterus doesn't need to bleed to clean itself.

I've had mixed experiences with it, still. I had some spotting at first, but it eventually stopped, but my mom has constant spotting after a few months until she stops for a week and resumes. This is honestly a way underrated way to go period free.

My long term plan is to stop taking the pills when I'm able to afford an ablation, but after I get my tubes yeeted out of my body. I just worry about the long term side effects of taking the pill until my reproductive system self destructs."

One part of my job was to stand and watch visitors in the goat petting area and the wallaby and butterfly walk through exhibits. There were a lot of entitled terrible people, but the elderly and kids who were interested and wanted to learn made it worth it.

One girl came in, I don't know, around 6? 7? And was very fascinated with the wallabies. She was asking about an adult that was laying down and asked about babies. We had a very young joey and an older joey and I had seen them out so I told her I could show her them.

She grabbed my hand and said, ""I'm going to hold your hand now, is that okay?""

Her parents, who were heavily tattooed if that helps with the image, seemed to be panicked about that, but I told them it was fine and I walked her to a part of the path near one of the mothers. I pointed her out and explained we would have to wait a little bit to see if the baby would peek out of the pouch.

I loved this girl. She asked twenty questions about what the joeys look like, how they're born, how long they stay in the pouch, what do they eat, the difference between wallabies and kangaroos, etc. Eventually, this little pink head poked out of the pouch and the joey stretched out so you could see her little arms and feet. SHE WAS SO EXCITED!

They left soon after and the girl kept talking about joeys and the parents thanked me for talking to her. It's honestly one of my favorite memories and is part of why I want to do work with outreach programs in conservation. I'm not a fan of kids, but I love sharing my passion for animals and seeing that same love in children makes me hopeful for the future."

My husband was raised probably similarly to your husband, his parents aren't crazy religious, but he did go to Catholic School up to third grade. Sometimes we talk about how it has stuck with him and the guilt he can't let go of. When we talk beliefs, he says he's more ambiguous, but he can't let go of the Catholic label because it's how he was raised, it's almost burned into him.

I'm thankful his parents don't expect me to talk religion or convert, but there is still their expectation that we'll have kids and raise them Catholic. They had a whole fit when I mentioned getting a tubal ligation, but they only talked to him over the phone about it and said we should talk to a priest about it. Oof, they don't know that, at most, I lean satanic temple satanist. It's like he's not allowed to be himself, both from his parents' perspective and with his struggle to find his own religion.

I can understand, in a rudimentary way, that struggle you're going through. Being raised in religion is almost a prison sentence, in a way. I hope you can overcome those feelings of guilt one day."
antinatalism,fppptcp,t3_geqthn,1588806820.0,"Edit: To preface, my bio dad was essentially a sperm donor married to my mom, but the guy I call my dad is actually my stepdad. My mom did not remarry the dumbass.

My mom wanted kids and was financially stable, house, two cars, job, etc. Unfortunately, even though she told her husband, my dad, that she was going off birth control and was ready for kids, his dumbass didn't think past the jizz.

He didn't even fight for custody and my mom got full rights and filed for bankruptcy to get a truck, in her name but in his possession, off her back. The divorce didn't effect me, my mom worked a lot, but my grandparents stepped in to avoid daycare. She remarried and my dad (stepdad) just has issues with talking. He's funny, but he's just awkward and kind of rude. My sister ruined my childhood, even my mom acknowledges she was a handful, but now she's older and less awful.

Honestly, the only things I wish my mom had considered are the fact anxiety runs in the family and that communication is crucial in relationships. She still has issues communicating with my dad and it frustrates me that they can't just TALK ABOUT IT.

Anxiety,fhz2kly,t3_f5ep7p,1581989406.0,"Every year, two nights for eight weeks, I go out. I put on a nice, tight fitting jacket and buckle up. I put on a full face of makeup, being careful to get my lipstick and eye lines right. I hang out with friends, drink lots of water, and eat tons of carbs and candy. We laugh, listen to music, and have a good time.

Then, for 5-8 hours, I scream at people. I jump and run and rev up chainsaws and shout and curse until my throat gives out.

Then I sleep really good.

I work at a haunted house as a crazy person in a straitjacket and corpse paint. It relieves stress so well, I'm surprised there isn't an institution where you can do this for therapy. 10/10 would recommend slamming into walls and yelling at people for 8 hours with no breaks."
Purdue,fhwa39q,t3_f4uo1w,1581910240.0,"Honestly, I think the freeze isn't honorable. It's just common courtesy. College should never be so expensive no one can afford it without help. Purdue charges just as much as any four year university and that's how it should be. I am certainly thankful, but this should be normal across the board."

Purdue,ffb3ejy,t1_ffaptq0,1579750774.0,"Sounds pretty similar. I feel like we should start reporting this kind of stuff to campus police, even if we just see it. Worst case scenario, it's a friendly misunderstanding, best case scenario we're deterring the weirdos.

Pm me if you need any info"
childfree,felmedf,t3_epm2ye,1579225651.0,"My husband is the same way. I'm 20 and he's 21, we got married a bit ago to save on college, and one of our biggest discussions has been on me being child free and him being a fence sitter. When he thought about it more, he told me it was all just the idea of kids. You get married, have kids, white picket fence, etc. You follow the script to be successful. Everyone has kids!

Sure, there are some upsides like you can teach older kids about stuff and that's cool if they get excited about it, but it's not just that. It's a 24/7, 365 job and it's expensive and hard to do right.

Of course, communication is the most important part of it all. I've always told him that, if he were to change his mind, we would part on good terms and remain friends. We're still young and I've always held child free beliefs while he only realized you could do that a couple years ago when we met.

People change and that's okay. It's all about how you move forward and take care of each other."

My class had a ""How To"" speech where you taught the class to do something and I taught the class air guitar. No regrets.

I attended ASU and got in state because I moved with my parents. Same deal with IUPUI (IU sucks). All I had to do was claim I moved for my parents, not to attend school, so I did not need to live here for two years. I've lived here for two years now and transferred to Purdue this summer without a problem. As long as you make some claim to not moving of your own accord or being under a parent or guardian's roof, who has residency, you should be golden. DM me if you need any clarification, good luck!"
