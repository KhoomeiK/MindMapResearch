Inventions,f81rld1,t3_dyjkn2,1574175706.0,I’d like to write and publish a book on having ptsd.
ptsd,f81mvnz,t3_dy3w0c,1574172278.0,"Yep. It gives secondary injuries. All the people who have judged you for either having a disability to those who think your crazy or lazy or somehow weak come flashing to mind because I’m broken too but I wasn’t holding a gun it makes me feel like all the people who have judged are probably right because there isn’t even a spot for me. I have the same when it comes to health care, no matter if you give people( health professionals) and I really want to skip saying Professionals because I don’t experience that but after letting someone know I have ptsd it isn’t any sign for them to act more professional or kind because I more than likely have ptsd because of trauma and people are cruel to people they think are weak( society stereotype) not the actual case but this is what people assume. I expect people to be kinder if not more professional they do the opposite I pray folks with ptsd can go see Dr’s at the VA because they have training on how to help or at the very least interact because when you deal with a Mental health situation You are supposed to be gentle. I know this because it’s the exact thing that made me great at my job working in the mental health profession. So if I could give basic respect all those years to others because I took my career seriously 😳 shouldn’t I be able to expect the same now that I’m on the other end? It not only reminds me of bad staff who just did it for the good money or the lazy coworkers who made my job harder but it reminds me of the very reason I went out of my way to not make that client feel weird or less than because of a issue. I’m a super humane person and this is more than I can take, so shouldn’t we be allowed to go where people are at least aware of ptsd or better do I dare say Trained to help someone with this disability? So yes. I agree."
misophonia,f81lr21,t3_dygmji,1574171367.0,I just understood that diagnosis. I’m sorry 😐 on top of All life’s other triggers that this happens too. When I hear someone chewing with mouth open I feel irritated but only because it’s like omg use your manners how can anyone not be more self aware that they’re doing that. But it’s like that apparently X 100. I’m sorry you have to feel that. I hope to god I’ve never done that around someone who survives this.

He’s a master at manipulation. Just think of the thing he called you the last time that made you cry. Remember that ugly thing he said and you wondered what kind of human being could call another human being such a nasty name? Got it, now write it down on paper and every time you feel weak take it out and say it out loud. That’s why you are choosing to get away from him because THAT is abuse he’s doing to you. Find your strength do something kind for your soul because people who love you won’t intentionally say things to destroy your love for yourself. Air hugs 🤗"
LifeAfterNarcissism,f7zkmw1,t1_f7yuht3,1574112101.0,"You know, I apologize if I hurt you. That was not my intent to hurt someone else in pain from them. It sounded like my ex’s sneaky ass so my intentions were to flush out that narcissist pretending and obviously trying to get the information on how we all are healing and putting up boundaries from them. I can tell your reply you aren’t a Narcissist. So for that injury I apologize. I’m super hyper critical and protective of any kinds of injury now and I honestly feel bad I called you out and you are like the rest just trying to figure this whole journey out and have support when it’s needed."
CPTSD,f7zj60r,t3_dy3npf,1574111481.0,I have 1 child her father is a narcissist he can’t see her. I have full custody. I’ve been separated from him well besides having to see him and hear him in court.
LifeAfterNarcissism,f7ziy9z,t3_dx9psj,1574111388.0,"My experience says no, they actually are never quenched with a damn audience of unaware monkeys my friend. Chill- this is my insight. How you worded your questions gave me a red flag. That’s honest. If you aren’t sweet my bad, but it made my gut hurt so there’s that."
CPTSD,f7zim0h,t3_dxuzq5,1574111246.0,♥️ of course you deserve at least that much you know. And so what if it’s not the ones who should be doing it. Some is better than none. We all know that feeling already.
CPTSD,f7zie52,t1_f7z40aw,1574111152.0,"I’m equally sad you had to be the adult and will now never know how it feels to trust grown ups. It’s too late you are physically a grown up and they robbed us of that normalcy. It won’t happen to my child, so at least I broke that cycle with me. My older brother did not it seems."
LifeAfterNarcissism,f7zi1j7,t3_dxoikp,1574111001.0,"Oh yeah. It’s word for word almost All of them. I’m over the shock part of that but what gets me is none of us no each other out of here you know, so it’s impossible that we should be able to know what that ex is like yet here we are all saying the same kinds of abuse. This tells me it’s a Mental Illness not a personality disorder. I think it needs a different language of diagnosis. It’s freighting that there isn’t some type of containment or anything for when they catch one of those guys. Girls too sorry if there are men reading our discussion too. But how are the left to just be in public like a serial killer kinda. It’s almost as bad but they don’t actually physically kill you they leave you there with your whole destroyed. And n-p-d has been around since Jesus himself if you look at Hitler and the likes and those are the ones we know about, so it’s not a shock or even a new breed of dangerous it’s just no ones doing anything about it criminally I mean. There’s now way they shouldn’t have consequences or something."
CPTSD,f7z62y3,t3_dxxjh4,1574105863.0,Yes. Best Wishes for healing while making your own money. It’s my biggest goal for myself.
CPTSD,f7z5l5l,t3_dxx82g,1574105652.0,"I agree too. Address in my mind oh okay so we’re doing this again because yeah, they come and go for whatever ready but okay, so I tell my little buddy (my brain) so you need to think of people getting cut in half by a plane that fell from the sky right now? Okay, it’s just a thought and the probability of this happening is maybe 1 in a trillion. Probably not going to happen today driving to Walmart. Oh, but I could? Yeah I suppose but we’ll, ( acceptance) I guess if that’s how I meant to die I guess it would be a different way to go than. That was me self talking through it. I also realized some tv shows I was watching weren’t actually helping my brain get numb to stuff it was hurting and triggering my worst fears stored waaay in there like Rob Dyrdecks shit I just blanked it out oh. Ridiculousness show. I had to stop putting that scary info in it was causing more intrusive scary thoughts. No you aren’t going crazy, your ( little buddy) is trying to process ALL info. Oh it’s been a week since I woke up in a nightmare with some scary things playing out in my head. I stopped watching his show about a month n half ago."
CPTSD,f7z48uq,t3_dxww4h,1574105076.0,This happens to me. I can’t watch a Animal being abused I almost black out from rage. Or abused women movies or a weaker injured person I holler at my tv cuss and have to turn the channel. Or the news most mornings and never after a full day at bedtime. I never was this way before so I know I’m grieving some pretty hard stuff otherwise it wouldn’t be up at the surface. I cry in movie theaters so I have to becareful which ones I bring my daughter to see it either embarrasses me or triggers me. I’ve thought it could a ptsd thing and if anyone else does this I guess. I just always have thought it was pushed down pain and now I’m mostly safe it wants to come out. Been out of my abusive relationship for 2&1/2 yrs. I can’t problem solve that just yet working on other more pressing stuff for me I think. But now that you mention it I’ll get to that too.
CPTSD,f7z32wv,t3_dxyvd3,1574104579.0,God damn. I’m 44 and this is the only time in my life I haven’t. I’m so sorry you haven’t any time. Omg. I’m so sad right now reading this. You’re whole life like this? You are hands down stronger than me.
CPTSD,f7z2g14,t1_f7vb6ik,1574104304.0,"Same, and I’m on a mission of self healing ain’t nobody got time to waste on how you interact with the ‘ extras” right now. I’m very self sufficient too. I’m not built for constant anyway. Let me be, I’m busy doing my thing. I encourage my child though so that’s tricky if it weren’t her needing friends I wouldn’t talk to anyone. I’m all f-d up because of other people’s problems."
CPTSD,f7z21fq,t3_dxmszu,1574104128.0,"Omg. The exact same minus the boyfriend. I mean the maximum effort just to get through a whole day is a lot. I get it. It would be nice I suppose but definitely not worth the work they require I’m healing and I’m trying to balance being the Best single mom I can be for my child it’s not a priority plus I don’t have the mental energy to be there for anyone all the time that isn’t my child same goes for a man, I’m super lonely but there again it requires to much energy focusing on someone else I barely have enough for us too m-f omg. I understand this back burner for now statement more every day."
CPTSD,f7z193j,t1_f7yjxqm,1574103783.0,I’m sooo sorry and proud of you for taking over where they failed you. I too parented myself as my mom was horribly selfish and vicious verbally and my dad was loud and extremely violent. Glad you survived too.
CPTSD,f7z0x9c,t1_f7xqquh,1574103640.0,I get this. My remember my mom had been crying leaning up against the bathroom tub one night and I was 7-8 and she was crying saying she cheated on her husband at the time and he didn’t want her anymore. I must have asked her why she was crying. So now that I am a parent of a little girl non the less I won’t let her see me cry unless it’s something like in a touching movie or something I remember how scared I was for her. Not my child! I hold that shit in like a pro till I can cry.
CPTSD,f7z0e4y,t1_f7xpd84,1574103409.0,"I didn’t want kids either, at age 10 I was a grown up. I did all the way through my last relationship with a narcissist. Now I feel my only child got jipped out because I have ptsd now and I was amazing before I wish I could have shown her the old me, but I’m fighting very hard to get to a place that I can be a form of my old self at least enough to work because she hasn’t been able to see me doing the damn thing just fighting through ptsd. I know she at least gets to see her mom never give up but dang the poor thing and she doesn’t even know any different because she wasn’t around back then. Hurts my heart. But maybe I would have raised her differently and maybe she would have been uncaring or something who knows I’m working on fixing my traumas so we both can win."
CPTSD,f7yz9sj,t1_f7wu8f1,1574102934.0,I’m sorry 😐 they did that to you.

Ex narcissist his friends n family my aunt is emotionally retarded my brothers their wives I’ve always just understood stuff better or differently than 90% of the people I’ve been surrounded by. I use to take great pride in my ability to see stuff different. Now with ptsd from work choices to do the right thing( confront) a psycho I doubt myself constantly. I miss that old feeling now that I realize I use to do that and don’t now. Huh

I use to be passive and a people pleaser so my facial expressions haven’t caught up to mindset yet I’m afraid I still do these stupid smiles a lot. Oh I know how to problem solve that negative reaction for you, after you giggle if you can implement it throw out there ( sorry it’s a nervous thing) or if you don’t want people to know you feel nervous throw out there it’s oh sorry too much caffeine or whatever word works for you so people don’t assume you’re just weird or emotionally immature it’s simply because you’re not sure how to respond at the moment it’s okay. Hope this helps with some ideas."

If you can’t than at least be quiet about it. Geez. I don’t have friends that are women that grew up with sisters usually because of this same thing. Man woman hatorade is drank by both. Congratulations on your New Job! That’s exciting and you get your own Place? Nice job!!"
CPTSD,f7ywnum,t3_dy0wrd,1574101830.0,"Damn I’m sorry. Some laws do leave loop holes towards the victims/ survivors. Get yourself a tablet of paper and start writing down the times the date and where you are running into him, or probably he is running into you. Document. Hopefully you have no common friends he can track your Cummings and goings by like if you go to a friends house for cribbage every Wednesday or something I realize he’s your neighbor so clearly he can see when you are or aren’t there but what about our in the community. I mean, who stabs there neighbor unless provoked. I’m guessing mental or drugs or both so beware. How about having a friend stay with you? Can you move? I don’t see this ending well for you. He’s not a narcissist is he? Maybe call up to your local police station and let them know or shit, drive up there and let them know he’s out and will they have a officer drive by on route even for your peace of mind if not to remind him he could go back to jail if his wacko mind thinks of hurting you again."
CPTSD,f7yvh16,t3_dy2qkp,1574101323.0,"It’s exhausting to be let down yet again, it’s exhausting to now have to dissect every thought from the broken dreams to broken promises to having not many if any around to talk about with because it wasn’t even the normal break up or normal pain everything about it is unfamiliar and the more you understand the more you need to realize the changes it really is exhausting in its self. But I look at this way, at least he won’t be adding anymore of it so once it’s actually dealt with and healed that’s that for his part. Unless you have children than it’s help you’re children survive too. Ugh. Life is messy on its best day this crap can take the wind out of your already tired sail. Remember to take a break from grieving and take a break even if it’s only long enough to enjoy a cold coffee it’s important to be kind to the broken parts too."
CPTSD,f7yufrz,t3_dxwi5m,1574100877.0,It is backwards. It’s like a N- is turned inside the wrong way. Omg. That’s why it’s so hard to make sense of the abuse. Wtf- literally it’s the opposite of a normal person. Whoa 😲

You could write it down and literally do the circle in circles till it hits the one you can’t branch out from trick. You said you feel scared like you will be hit, so fake love from authentic love have to see the two are different by feeling both maybe go through the sadness when someone beat rather than support. Analyze Analyze the full impact maybe. Or, sorry my brain is tapped for today I hope any helped pinpoint for you."
CPTSD,f7yskyd,t3_dy220x,1574100089.0,Vulnerable and trust. Maybe start there before acceptance of being loved. Why what makes you feel vulnerable than why then maybe acceptance. Idk it’s just what I thought when I read it. Or whatever order needs to come. Are you hesitant on the Love one because there are other things under that is what I mean.

This happened a few years ago to me but because of my other traumas other things take priority in problem solving I just had the epiphany a couple days back that my triggers with Health care professionals probably stemmed from this one incident. Someone just helped me realize here in another post that I’m feeling aggressive not standing up for myself, i have to go reread that I blanked the other word out. Anyway just lost my train of thought on this one. But Thank you for talking to me about this. My daughter is 8 Years old now so it’s taking me almost 8 years to get to the bottom of this Trigger but.. progress is progress no matter how slow they say. I can now at least start to address my trust issues for that group( health field professionals)OH I just remembered it’s Assertive that’s my new goal I got aggressive another different approach needed, I’m writing this Down it’s a lot omg I just had another epiphany, I had to learn to be aggressive verbally in my relationship with my daughters dad he was an abusive narcissist. Omg! That’s where this came from. I think I blew past assertiveness Years ago, I wanna be assertive now a days as I relearn to stand up for myself. Wow Reddit has been a total Bless to find and most folks on here are real and I needed this."

My way works for me, it’s not daily that I can talk to another human being about personal insights for me or someone else. I take offense that you’re judging me and not only that scolding me as a child for joining in by telling me to go post somewhere else. Wow, that’s pretty harsh of you actually and to empty I’m attention seeking for encouragement. Wow 😮 I hope you never need my encouragement or insight, I’m going to remember you’re name on here and you are not right for responding to my grief like that."

Sometimes hearing “ you got this” goes a long way, I was feeling a little overwhelmed with yet another thing I needed to figure out to than turn around and figure out how to do it better than to turn around and try to implement the new behavior and response. It’s tough healing yourself but I’m the only one who can, so off I march to learn as much as I can about this realization and Bless you for being encouraging to me today. I Appreciate that."

CPTSD,f7yljih,t1_f7ygg6w,1574097076.0,"Thank you for seeing the issue for me, it’s exactly how I feel. Right? A Dr I trusted to help me with my high blood pressure and help me with my flashbacks that cause insomnia. I trusted this man. Because he had all the years of college regarding health issues I didn’t have. Now forget I was in a relationship with a narcissist who was abusing me, forget I had ptsd. Forget I was a woman he didn’t know him personally. Just as me being a person this effected me deeply, he literally was saying to my face you shouldn’t be a mom right? Unprofessional for sure no medical reason I wasn’t facing death if had given birth or had a pregnancy because I had ptsd that couldn’t have killed me and in that instance I think he could have even said well, here’s the facts but he just said yep, you’re pregnancy test at home was right, you’re pregnant, you should have an abortion. I can’t trust Doctors now like at all. I don’t know how to heal past this, I literally have a trigger for being disrespected or spoken down at any health facility. And Thank you for reading between the lines, I have the hardest time it turns out expressing my inner thoughts when I need to. I didn’t post this to talk about weather I believe it’s my right or not to have an abortion. I wrote this because I realized I have Trauma from this and I’m stuck on how to think about it even.

I can’t do that but I’ve changed clinics a few times since that happened and because it did something at my core I haven’t been able to heal it. I am talking about some issues I’ve been working on and got stuck at with my own healing so maybe, hopefully I’ll figure it out better and maybe someone will have gone through similar and can tell me their path of healing and I can go that route too. Thank you so much for responding. This is the first attempt I’ve made to address this as I only figured this part out the other day. Omg. So much trauma to deal with. I was already ptsd and in a abusive relationship with a Narcissist when this happened, so I’m thinking it hit pretty deep as I didn’t have normal guards up to begin with."

LifeAfterNarcissism,f7yhbu5,t1_f7jesc9,1574095074.0,Seriously. Read up. He has The Mental Illness called Narcissistic Personality Disorder.
LifeAfterNarcissism,f7yh0g4,t1_f7je4ej,1574094902.0,No he’ll try. Probably 15 more times. And watch out with that the abuse and time frame it use to take him gets ramped up. He feels the control over you leaving. And they play no part of losing a play toy. It’s start with you’re perfect and you calm him like no one else he’s lost without you than he’ll get suicidal and you might fall for that not knowing they use ALL manipulation tricks to have you fooled so they can hurt you with your own empathy and sympathies. Read as much as you can about narcissist gas lighting and everything else on the internet it’s the only reason I found out it was him and not me it saved my life in hind sight.
LifeAfterNarcissism,f7ygcdg,t3_dwdpzx,1574094539.0,"I was just thinking yesterday about this exact thing. Weird. It’s odd that word for word these two men have never met yet act almost identical. Mine called me a whore my entire pregnancy with his daughter. Because I had left him the 2 Nd time he had to do treatment and was dating a non Nex then I found out I was pregnant, so legitimately it could be either because I was 11 was pregnant when I found out. So I knew I wasn’t a whore but that was the only thing he needed to abuse me for the next 5 years. Because I had integrity and told my current boyfriend and the Nex. Well turned out i got pregnant by the nar- so I came from a family of divorce and it wasn’t going to happen to my child so I broke up with the normal guy and went back to endure the loser because I was having his child. He told everyone who would listen to him I was a cheating whore I found out later. They’re all the same. Sick they are. Like seriously the Worst mental illness I’ve ever seen and I worked in health care for a thousand yrs."

Revenge only would add to your pain because you are a good person you would feel remorse for causing pain and it would feel like guilt. That’s a whole lot of no thank you for me. Recently I’m kinda scaring myself though, it’s not my nature normally I’m 44 but in the last year I actually am wishing people go through exactly what they have done to me. I feel shameful as I have lived my life feeling good that I wasn’t petty and taking a higher road than so many of my friends but .. I gotta be honest I kinda dig it. I pray it happens to someone when they hurt me now. Not sure if that’s a bad sign or a progressing sign from abuse. Idk"
LifeAfterNarcissism,f7yf4c7,t1_f7lu0z1,1574093794.0,"Omg. I’m a straight up bitch with facial expressions and loud now- this resonates with me too. I got walked on my entire life and I’m finally saying Nope- No More. And All the rage behind this decision that made me this way to begin with. It’s a trigger now. A real ptsd Trigger from too many. Here’s a example I just figured out in the last 3 Years I had this old friend that well, was pretty but was into drinking and drugging so because of the person I am I would always offer to go with her when she’d hang around her “ other” friends and be a sober cab to make sure she didn’t die or get raped or whatever. She use to introduce me as her friend she called Wilber from the kids movie about the piglet. I asked her one time why that movie character she told me it was because I was gentle like him. Well, I realize now it’s because she was skinny and I was thick and she thought I was simple, because I was kind. This kind of shit. Fuck people. They’re making me mean asf"
LifeAfterNarcissism,f7yebs2,t1_f7lbvvn,1574093286.0,Mine is how people say stuff at me. I can’t find any cues I can tell myself to just sit there and not be offended. I literally can’t. Any work for you if someone is being a bitch and talking down to you? Because yelling back when someone is quietly disrespecting you to your face is frowned on. But they desperately deserved it. And every single time they needed a reality check on their level of importance.
LifeAfterNarcissism,f7ye340,t1_f7khfob,1574093129.0,Right. I’ve been trying to explain the exact first part of this for 5 years. I’m not comfortable with confrontation either but I’m at a point at 44 yrs old and have been a survivor of domestic abuse from a Nar and from my own work and family and dr’s and nurses that I literally can’t not say anything. It flies out of my mouth because it triggers trauma. I can’t seem to heal it either. I’m totally sick to death of being treated like my feelings are not even important enough to be at the least shown common courtesy at the least of human behaviors we can do- wtf?!
LifeAfterNarcissism,f7ydkbn,t1_f7tpkw7,1574092776.0,"But how do you hold them accountable? They go with we have a zero tolerance. Well, damn. So do I it’s why I have to check you and your condescending attitude, or worse. What did you do when you encountered bad treatment from a health care provider nurse or Dr or both?"
LifeAfterNarcissism,f7ydd2v,t3_dwm1tu,1574092641.0,I’m trying to figure out this exact thing. I say something which at best is uncomfortable where before the trauma that broke the camels back so to say I get told to stop yelling and I’m actually Not yelling or I get called difficult or blah blah but I also can’t sit idly by and be treated bad anymore. People know if they are treating you bad I mean come on anymore shouldn’t they expect it? It’s called being called out on your bullshit right? When did not standing up for one self become okay to void my human rights to be treated with respect. I don’t get it either.
LifeAfterNarcissism,f7ycg7j,t3_dwsnv6,1574092026.0,The covert has someone else punish too because it couldn’t look like it was them. I agree here.
LifeAfterNarcissism,f7yc8kk,t3_dx9psj,1574091882.0,Anyone else read this and get a red flag? Like maybe someone is trying to gain deeper insight oh how to win back a supply maybe? My gut says this isn’t right. Even the name sounds awfully N-
LifeAfterNarcissism,f7ybxvc,t3_dxautr,1574091677.0,"Omg. Classic dismissal and blaming. I agree, no response is the Best way. My aunt does/ did this abuse about my ex and my brothers. It’s tricky huh? They are super duper clever."
LifeAfterNarcissism,f7ybo2l,t3_dxjvqz,1574091488.0,"Omg. I’m so sorry. He is sick. I’m sorry you are having to handle that from your father. I understand this cynical way of thinkin. You’re trying to guard against more pain. I’m a only girl I heard “ your mom” and then get blamed and treated badly abusively because I looked like my mom from my aunt and dad and my brothers didn’t protect me my older brother joined in Happy it wasn’t happening to him he started calling me crazy and pointing out any possible flaw about me he could I was 9 Years old! ( only girl) here. I get it. And I am sorry I just read this. I’m sure your sister isn’t standing by you because she’s happy it isn’t happening to her I bet too! Cowards! They are cowards, that is Wrong!"
LifeAfterNarcissism,f7yb0ys,t3_dxn4ah,1574091051.0,"Oh and after I had begged the covert aunt for 2 years to take my child even for 2 days so she could get a break from that environment or I could have a break I finally got that house sold and I got another one far away from him but so that it was area my child could at least recognize when her papa was alive I went the through what a real prisoner of war goes through and the body recognizes it is safe- I started to cry and my body wouldn’t let me stop just gruesome pain poured out and I never wanted my little girl to see me cry so I drove my child to the one person I had contact with that was not her father and tears in my eyes made her take my child so I could go ball without my 6 yr old staring up at me, she convinced a cousin to call cps on me. The complaint is still to this day that I brought my daughter to her house and made her take care of her for a day and half she said I was crying and shouting at her because I needed a break and I didn’t have anyone but her and I left coming back a day n half later to get her. 1 person left I could bring my child to. 1. And she took her opportunity to do me like that after years of me begging even as I watched my dad slowly starve to death in front of my old family who had hurt me beyond me being able to forgive them and dealing with their comments about me not doing enough for my dad. Not understanding the extreme abuse I was already going through. But my aunt did. That’s what the human narcissist spirit does to you if they see a weakness. That’s why that bitch can keep borrowing me money."
LifeAfterNarcissism,f7y9p4i,t3_dxn4ah,1574090137.0,"I accidentally did this same thing with my covert aunt and my daughters father straight narcissist. It literally is they smell weakness even if it’s because in my case my dad was dying of a terminal cancer, they hit you hard guns blaring and if you’re off balance At All they aim to take you out at your trembling knees. Relentless attacks. Day after day. Towards the end of me finally getting away from my daughters dad he went at us constant I couldn’t even sleep. I had to move away from my own home only to be threatened he would wreck my home beyond being able to sell it so I would be stuck with no money. And no friends or family support actually I had 1 family member who was the last I even talked to who turned out she’s a covert N. She was making me feel terrible because I wouldn’t stay and take his abuse because that’s how some men are. The last two months I had to rent a hotel so my daughter and we’re safe enough to get some sleep and he wouldn’t break my car so I could get her to school and back. I was pushed beyond anything I have ever endured without being able to escape. I would physically shake. I honestly could have murdered him if I had blacked out. My entire being screamed at the sound of his voice the smell of his cologne or the smell of alcohol or loud noises would make me crumble up in a ball. I had broken my own control of fighting back. I literally couldn’t stop I was in Constant Fight and flight. I was in wild bear protecting my baby mode and I couldn’t shut it off. It literally is like a prison of war. Just they weren’t in another country it was here and no one came to help us. I’ve been away from him for 2 &1/2 Years now and I’m just starting to not look over my shoulder at every corner I walk around in my own house. He had previously broken into my home and promised to do it again when I didn’t expect him anymore."

All the way up today when that asshole in his semi tailgated me so bad I could read kenworth from my rear view mirror when my little girl was sitting in my back seat not even aware that if a deer ran out and I slammed my breaks on he’d kill her or hit my brakes because someone was coming into my lane, him knowing at 60 mph he could not stop his rig and she would for sure be crushed all because he was having a bad day or he wanted to speed.
