Because you were already USED to be treated like this, and maybe he seemed to be at least in “improvement“ from what you were already used to in the past? Like maybe your friend has BPD and is 95% toxic, but your exwBPD was 85% toxic, so it felt like an improvement?  I’ll tell you my example: my ex-boyfriend is very toxic, but I know for a fact that he is less toxic than my ex-husband, so when I first dated my ex-boyfriend I thought it was an “improvement” that he wasn’t so much of a smart ass and hurtful as my ex husband was.  And because of that, I tolerated my ex-boyfriend’s craziness for four years. It got worse towards the end, but still, I tolerated a lot."

They had a big argument about why he wouldn’t give it up, and he finally confessed his age lie.

I think the only thing you can do right now is try and stay as mindful as possible. Just to get through the day. Towards the end of my prior marriage, my ex-husband scared me so much that I slept in my child’s bedroom by the door, with a knife by my side to protect us.  The next day, I still had to pack up my condo since I was leaving him, and the only way i coped in order to keep moving without thinking of that terror was to stay mindful of what i was doing.  And so I mindfully packed up all my things, and it helped get me through that storm.

Thank you for your testimony, the more that people talk about the positive effects of Prognenolone, the more it will convince people who need help to give it a try.  And I’m really glad that you found my post to help inspire you to continue.  When I first bought it, I was so desperate for peace of mind that even if it turned out to be just a placebo, I decided that i would still religiously take it just to even “fake it to make it.“ But thank God that wasn’t the case, and now even in my most troubled moments my mind is much calmer and relaxed now, and less anxious.  

This morning i started thinking about my train wreck of a life again, and the suicidal thoughts started to rev up.  Right then and there I knew it was time for another round of Prognenolone, so I took a pill and within about 15-20 minutes the thoughts faded from my train of thought! I started to focus on what I needed to do today to make my life better.  This stuff is no short of a MIRACLE!!! 🙏🙏🙏"

depressed,fpqy3vj,t1_fpqqjmy,1588835806.0,"Wow, you have some really valid points here. I’ve added in many posts to this subreddit, talking about how my son is my motivation. As miserable as I feel inside, whenever he comes back to me (as I only have him 50% of the time), the happiness and brightness he brings to my heartbreaking life gives me moments of joy, and a definite purpose to press on.  Mainly my reasons are because he deserves the best childhood that i can give him.  I still have future hopes to find a reliable and loving husband to also add to my life, but for now immediate family I have with my son and a few others gives me a reason to push ahead and continue to work on my life for the better.

On the flip side,  I know that some people will look at both of our posts and say, “You don’t have to have a family in order to have purpose!” So in response to that, I will say that if you create goals in your life to look forward to, and also surround yourself with friends that are like family, this also gives value and purpose of life as well. For example, if you work at a regular soul draining job, but you make personal goals like taking time off for a mini vacation every six months, or take a class in something you really like after work, etc., then that gives life more meaning.

NOTE:  All of this is easier said than done for people like us with depression. However, just keeping your eye on the prize, and even taking baby steps to get there, is at least some sort of progress. And we should be proud of ourselves we do you have any amount of progress.

Four years later, I have a new job, a new place, and am just waiting for him to step up, but he STILL hasn't come through on his end for building our ""new life together""...

...then some twists:  He gets tired of me and my demands for ""normal relationship progress,"" and so he purposely set it up so that I  would BREAK UP with HIM because he was too coward to break up with ME(long story, he admitted this to me much later)...a few months later, I got vulnerable and we start dating again when he came back into my life.  However, we both agreed it would only be ""casual"" and we could see other people.  One day, after yet another session of him bragging about all the women he dated while we were broken up(INCLUDING showing me ACTUAL PICTURES of them), I got fed up and let him know that he wasn't alone, and I was getting dates myself at that present time...

BIG MISTAKE.  He couldn't take it and over the next few weeks starts going on a rampage of insanity and jealousy:  Saying demeaning things to me, checking my phone while I'm sleeping, sending me a pic of my ex-husband and his new family, etc.  Note that all this time he was ""future faking"" me again out of fear of losing me to one of my new dating prospects.  He had setup all these job interviews and said that once he got a job he would make me his ""wife.""  But things got out of hand when I found out that he actually set it up his friend to CATFISH ME!  He said he set up the Catfish because he wanted his friend to keep me ""busy"" while he secured a job for ""our future."" His friend was relentless and kept demanding attention while constantly standing me up for dates...when I found out that he set all this Catfish crap up, it floored me...in the end I was so worn down by his abusive tactics I GOT FIRED from my job because of work performance.  

He took the blame of my termination, and ""future faked"" me again by taking all responsibility and saying he would ""fix it"" and go trucking long haul to make up for my lost income.  6 months later, he STILL didn't do it, and has only given me a hundred here and there, not enough AT ALL for my bills.  In the end he was incapable of even getting a new job because of his low safety score record, which I found out about later.

depressed,foxzwmu,t3_ga4su8,1588161659.0,"I’m so sorry dear, you’ve experienced very traumatic experiences.  The rape I can in no way compare to anything that happens day to day, but the cop and nurse who treated you so badly truly reflect the harsh reality of how insensitive some people are in life.  Their behavior always catches you when you least expect it.  Eventually we have to learn to be ready to demand fair treatment when we get in situations like this.  I’ve been treated poorly my whole life because i didn’t demand fair treatment, and now I’m a shell of the great person i should have become. But i press on because i have a son and caring family that i have to live for, and am learning to try and “arm myself” for such bad experiences.  You see a lot of this stuff as well on TV when people tell their true accounts of discrimination.

Sometimes I compare extremely rude people toa deer in headlights - you can sometimes see the glare of insanity in their blank stare, which often shows their sociopathic ways 😡 For the life of me, I don’t know why this stuff happens to the innocent like yourself, but I pray anyways for comfort and peace that someday God will deliver kharma to the ones that have delivered pain.

Someone else just reported this happened to them with their best friend as well, just before she went to college. 10 years later and she’s dedicated her life to helping others with the same experience.  If you’d like to talk with her maybe I can find her info and she might be able to help you, or at least provide some comfort.  You can DM me if you’d like...just know that You’re definitely not alone. ❤️

R/Jrd_bitterboi has the best advice.  It’s sounds like they had a very traumatic experience with a therapist/group as well, and that’s also very unfortunate, but a lot of times in life,  you’re gonna have to take a chance on people, just to get what you need.  And that truly sucks too, I’ve experienced a cop being EXTREMELY RUDE AND INSENSITIVE to me on the phone when someone hacked my ebay/amazon/gmail account and purchased about $3000 of stuff.  I was scared the hackers would come to my house to get the items, and he refused to aid me and said horrible comments -  I couldn’t BELIEVE that he acted that way to me - I ended up telling him “well If you won’t help me, then I’ll just have to defend myself” - but he cut me off before i finished that entire sentence...I was so scared and shocked 😡"

CamGirlProblems,fowqs40,t1_fowq4xw,1588125178.0,"...and I TOTALLY get that girl.  Alot of these types of sexual fetishes have weird names and we often get sucked into doing stuff without knowing exactly what it is.  I remember first seeing it on Niteflirt, and there are a GOOD AMOUNT of black women doing raceplay on Niteflirt (then again, they could be non-blacks with a fake profile trying to make an extra buck, I can definitely see that happening).  And alot of them had GREAT REVIEWS!  I was floored, it was so shocking to see how many racists seek, find and execute this demented behavior.

I knew one lady who did it and was Black, she said if it got too much she would just cuss out the guy and hang up. But still, I wonder if that shit affected her mind and heart.  

I'm glad you got out of that experience and can be open about it, and create a discussion about it, it shows how strong you are. :) Good luck out there in camModelLand!"
CamGirlProblems,fowphna,t3_g9v212,1588124442.0,"This shouldn't even be considered as an option for cammodels, PERIOD.

To the OP:  Please know that I am not shaming you, I know you said you did this before,and I respect your experience with this.  I just feel so strongly about raceplay being CRUSHED.  

It's already hard enough to be a cammodel, getting approached by not only regular people, but also predators and down low mega perverts.  But THIS?!  It's bad on so many levels, and can definintely soul crushing, SMH...

I've had a few non-blacks try and bring in racial slurs to the conversation - I ban them quickly.  Sometimes, not quick enough :( ...So I know that we're gonna have to face this and the whole ""have you ever been with a white man before?"" question that's asked every freakin' time I cam.  But  we gotta draw the line somewhere.  Racism is EVIL, and so they're asking us to entertain evil, with no respect to our own person. 

When I first heard about raceplay, I couldn't believe it.   To think, a good chunk of our ancestors, both women AND men, had to endure this everyday, but for them, it WASN'T ACTING..."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fotgrp7,t1_forcqyc,1588053467.0,"You stayed because that’s we women love too much.  That’s not a bad thing, but unfortunately this world can’t handle it, because men use their aggression to rule. I had a boyfriend after my divorce and gave this LVM 4 years of my life too.  I had a medical bout then too and he wasn’t all there for me neither.  He took off the day of to take care of me, but that’s because of guilt(LONG story).  But no extra days OF TLC, even when I felt vulnerable and said I needed him.

I have tons of female fingers pointing at me, making me feel shame.  They don’t try to make me feel bad on purpose, but they do.  But I knew, I KNEW that a lot of women are going through this.

FemaleDatingStrategy,foqszfs,t1_foqqowb,1588000274.0,"Girl I’m SO SORRY you went through that!  I truly HATE that you went through that.  When it happens, the abusive treatment of being the darkest child is so crippling.  Your home is supposed to be your safe haven, dammit!  My Father was one of the darkest too in his family and was treated lower than most of his siblings.  It caused him to become a huge people pleaser and he tries to cater to his friends so much,  and will even throw us under the bus for it at times, it’s very sad.  

My Mom is like you actually, she’s light brown, but it was her cousins and aunts that said racist stuff to her because she was the “darkest” of her more lighter sisters(my great grandmother was half Cherokee/White, etc).  That’s why my mom stopped us COLD if we adopted the same colorist principles from school peers or other influences.  She won’t even admit that she’s lighter than us, she’ll get the darkest makeup even though it’s totally non-matching, LOL...

...and it gets CRAZIER:  After awhile, My grandmother even kept my mother and siblings away from her side of the family as they got older, because her cousins encouraged inbreeding just to keep the family on the lighter side - CRAZY RIGHT?! 🤢

I’m so glad you’re getting therapy for this!  Many of us don’t believe in therapy, so it’s always a relief when i hear a fellow sister or brother is getting it!  I go to therapy too for other familial and relationship issues - my immediate family is pretty old school, so they frown upon me getting it, but my aunts on the other hand are in therapy almost every week LOL

UGH X 💯!!!  I can’t believe those French men.  We had that happen here too, I don’t know if you saw the video of I think three basketball players, saying that they were part of the “white wives club “or something like that.

FemaleDatingStrategy,foqm0wv,t1_foql5n1,1587996477.0,"That’s great, and I’m sure her husband had a good influence at some time in his life to promote his good nature - I’m talking about if a man doesn’t have any good influences to TEACH him to act like this.  My ex husband never had a Dad, his Mom was never around since she was constantly working to pay the bills.  So in the end i realized that no one taught him how to be a proper man.  No excuses for him of course, but when the chips were down, or was easier for him to ignore me rather than face the music."

And they all do the exact same things.  Just like polygamy, when men do this it reflects the wild animal kingdom so much, it’s their natural instinct to wanna “dip their wick,” regardless of the consequences.  If anything, I feel we have to ingrained proper “civilized” behavior in our male youth to not be these type of losers.  I have a son right now, and he’s still young and a very good boy, but I’m starting to filter now before it’s too late.  And it’s hard too because i don’t want him to become a mama’s boy LOL"

FemaleDatingStrategy,foq7vnh,t1_fop8exz,1587986092.0,"r/princessTiaraLove has many good points, but I’ll just backup one:  As a culture, slavery has ingrained different degrees of self-hatred as a collective whole within our culture. So Black mothers in general don’t pass down principles of “hatred.” Now don’t get me wrong, Colorism is REAL, and principles of that are easily passed down through some Black mothers, but not all. I’ve seen both sides myself: My own somewhat lighter-skinned mother would scold us if my siblings and I (who were darker) would self-degrade ourselves because of our skin tone and other African traits, but my ex-mother in law who was also lighter skinned was so color struck she was delusional, and it passed down to my deeply narcissistic lighter skinned ex-husband, who once attempted to ignorantly compare our skin tones, IN BED, right after sex!  

r/luv_dub has some good points though, Just wanted to clarify 😊"
