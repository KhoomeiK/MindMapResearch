In my state we just passed recreational last december, so I assume majority of my state smokes weed. Speaking for myself, I feel it calms my senses, but my therapist doesn't see it that way. She's religious, not that it makes much of a difference, but it seems our minds just clash.
  As far as meds, I feel very much like a guinea pig. It seems they just throw meds at me until something works. I was on 2 AP's at one point which induces akethesia, for me at least. Now I'm down to 1 and my moods are shifting like crazy. My psychiatrist doesn't have a probelm with me smoking weed, but my therapist on the other hand as far as tools, it seems she's basing everything on depression and cannabis. Unless I'm just hearing things wrong. I'm gonna give it some time and maybe switch my psychologist. It's either that, or I'm just very resistent, or so it seems.

TooAfraidToAsk,evxmbvs,t3_clr5hg,1564897689.0,"I would assume because the under side of the tub is pretty much hollow sitting on a slab on concrete. When the bottle hits, it vibrates the metal therefore creating an acoustic like sound which amplifies in your eardrums making it sound much louder than it actually is due to the echo like effect. The shampoo bottle is also hollow, creating a hollow like sound on hollow metal or fiberglass. Basically the sound wave vibrates the organ inside your middle ear, thus creating sound. This is only an educated guess, take it like a grain of salt. I'm way too stoned for my logical sense to kick in right now. It makes sense in my mind. Now, if a tub was flat all the way around, sitting flush on the concrete and no hole underneath the concrete to run the plumbing, you may hear a slight thud, but not much of an echo due to less resistance on the surface of the tub.  Basically this creates a weak spot in terms of sound. When you hit a hollow bucket, the sound amplifies because there is no lid to block out that sound. Throw a lid on the bucket and the sound is much more deep and not much reverb due to the fact there's not much room for the sound to escape. This also would vary depending on if the shampoo bottle were empty vs full. The more weight I would assume would produce a louder much more defined sound vs an empty bottle or half bottle which would create a more hollow or echo sound since the sound is producing within the bottle as well. I would assume the sound would differ depending on the molecular structure of the actual product since some shampoo's/conditioners are much more thick than others. The more runny, I would assume it wouldn't produce a well defined sound wave and would be a higher pitched thud vs an echo like sound. If you know anything about acoustical sound, this would make a bit more sense in terms of amplification. Think in terms of a music festival indoor in an auditorium vs an outdoor venue in an open field. There's not much outside to block out the sound other than trees and buildings. And not much room for sound waves to bounce around creating an echo within your brain. Sound waves bounce around much like the light that reflects through your cornea to produce vision."

I have never heard anybody boofing cannabis. What was it like? Did you just shove it up there, or did you roll joints and hit it with your butthole? I'm just slightly curious. Were the effects different?"
AskReddit,eu5gpuw,t3_cesph4,1563477207.0,I would say something on Atari. After that the earliest I can really remember was Super mario bros w/ duck hunt. I was 6 years young. I stayed up for hours playing Mario Bros. man! My mom used to get so pissed

schizoaffective,etzbuud,t1_etyt4u5,1563329682.0,"I didn't find you fucked up man. You and I think right on the same level. I don't mind sharing probably due to me not giving out my real name anyway lol Fuck that shit dude. I find myself to be pretty fucked up, so I don't feel I really have the space to judge others. I'm not like that man, you're cool in my book my dude,or maybe you're a chick. I have no idea lol"
schizoaffective,etzbty2,t3_ce4n7w,1563329672.0,"   I tend to completely shut people out, and tend to dissociate myself from literally everything and everybody. This can go on for months and months at a time. When on meds, this isn't so much an issue, but I can still become delusional depending on circumstance. Like if somebody fits a certain profile of people, they may or may not enter a delusion or make me delusional and/or paranoid. Or maybe I just won't like that person becasue I'm convinced that they could be an udercover agent or spy or something, keeping an eye on me to gain my information. And then I completely avoid said person. Like I feel like some people pry me for my personal information, strictly to use against me to destroy me. Much like the dude below me said, like a blood thirsty vampire. And this is no joke.   
   My zodiac doesn't help me because I'm jsut naturally suspicious, and then you add in sz symptoms which could or maybe not turn into paranoia, triggering everything else. Delusions, hallucinations, thought broadcasting,etc... Re-integrating myself slowly, like turtle slow helps. But I don't go out much, so the lack of human interaction seems to over ride some thoughts, and re-engage paranoid thoughts thinking people follow me around and monitor my life. Things like that."
schizoaffective,etzaa8u,t3_cdtgg6,1563329049.0,"For a long time I thought it was just me that thought that other animals could communicate with me and read my thoughts. My family sees it too which is weird. I attatched it more to a spiritual ability, probably my native indian heritage. I consider them more as my spirit animal. So far it seems to be deer and red tail fox. This deer was staring at me hard, and I associated that particular deer as my spirit animal. I'm weird like that, but gives me positive vibes to think about rather than negative. This squirrel in my yard comes right up to me and begs me for food. Can't be domesticated since I live in a rural area. I found that weird lol"
schizophrenia,etz70mq,t1_ettpy5o,1563327781.0," My sleep schedule seems to fluctuate depending on my mental status. If I'm good, I'm usually awake during the day. And vise versa if I'm not. 
I don't really recall when they popped up, they just kind of appeared years after my diagnoses. I find that kind of odd. Was diagnosed 22 years ago, they popped up probably 3 or 4 years, 5 tops."
schizophrenia,etz6mvg,t1_ettt64w,1563327627.0,"Well a plus side is I'm attempting to go back to work next week. Slowly but surely I suppose. Another plus is I made cannabis butter, so now I can make edibles and keep myself entertained and busy making shit. Making CBD gummy bears next week lol My state passed recreational last december, so I figure why not if it's legal. So now we have both rec. and medical which is odd, but gives me something to do and growing seems to be a passion of mine. So I enjoy it. Work wise I'll be working construction so I'm not surrounded by people all day making me paranoid and all weird like."

schizophrenia,ettp7mt,t3_cdebpi,1563191175.0,"I like how you wrote mirror on the mirror.  
My personal experience with shadow people is that I've convinced myself they are my guardians, just here to look over me and protect me from danger that may or may not lie ahead. Including bad weather.   
I went to check my mail at like 3 am cuz I don't like sunlight, I'm a vampire. And they like rushed at me super fast and it scared the living piss out of me. I remember kicking on my kitchen light because I was paranoid as fuck at that point, and realized it was raining pretty hard outside. They tend to linger in my kitchen for some odd reason. So I figured at that point they were just warning me not to go outside. I don't know if this helps at all, but hopefully it does. I suck at this sort of thing. I like your drawing though. I now think of them as my protector and they're strictly here to look over me and ward off the evil. I know the feeling of no sleep, it's 7:44 am as I type this lol Hope you feel better my friend! If you need someone to talk to, you're more than welcome if you need to pass the time."
