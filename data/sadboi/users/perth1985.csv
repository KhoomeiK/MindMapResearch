 Please don't take it personally-By any chance if you are from Australia and having seen the work culture there- Don't take anything for granted and be mindful and respectful of others as it really goes long way in Japan.If you are in a management role, then note that you can't simply hire and fire people or treat them like back home.If you don't like overtime then stay back for at least sometime or leave in a humble tone as I have seen some foreigners who would slam their stuff and leave.Obviously,this doesn't leave good impression and wont last long.
