depression,fhfeq9t,t3_f2qwaw,1581541903.0,"I find it so hard to have a conversation nowadays - my mind just goes blank when I'm talking to someone. Even the simplest words can just disappear and I end up stuttering or pausing while my brain tries to engage. At work I've become incredibly anxious about taking or making phone calls. Its got to the point where I'll do anything to avoid it. Even writing emails has become difficult. I can spend ages replying to someone as it seems to take forever to string a few sentences together.  I read books regularly, always have done, but now I can barely remember what I've read almost immediately after I put a book down."
