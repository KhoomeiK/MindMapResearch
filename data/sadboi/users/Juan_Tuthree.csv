Blind,fqr5b8v,t3_gimr5p,1589577866.0,Ok did you guys just read the title or the whole post?
Blind,fqr3zxs,t1_fqr2f4k,1589577166.0,Yeah i was born legally blind and i live alone. I play 3 instruments and im fairly good at videogames. I can even read with my eyes despite my nystagmus although doing so is very taxing. I can get around without a cane and my acuity is 20/200 in my good eye. We can do damn near anything we set our mind to and indeed are capable of great things yet the common populace believes us to be helpless cripples who cant wipe our own ass
Blind,fqk33q5,t1_fqk2xyu,1589419347.0,I get the feeling you only read the title
Naruto,fqi5zl7,t3_giro32,1589390848.0,Id like to say that personally i would want obito to be redeemed but couldnt think of a way for it to narratively make sense other than using talk no jutsu plot device. I wanted him to bring madara back and that meant obito forgoing his redemption

Naruto,fqh8zcg,t1_fqf04pd,1589371408.0,This would be so much better than watching the little brat bitch about his dad while having everything his dad worked for handed to him on a silver platter
Naruto,fqgyva0,t1_fqgvr3z,1589361935.0,Yeah and i think having it this way to where everyone thought it was over but the BAM madara.comes back but instead of the long and drawn out way it is done in the anime you would have the best of both obito and madara. Madara coming back to naruto and sasuke with 6 paths chakra and having this massive battle with juubi madara would be dope af
Blind,fqgxw1x,t1_fqguwrk,1589360965.0,Aye man its all in good fun though just teasing ya
Naruto,fqgxogf,t1_fqgjijp,1589360747.0,"So at worst hes equal with base madara and also casually knocks out kurama, the same kurama that minato lost his life to, although tbf he did just tangle with obito and he died to seal away half of kurama and to make naruto the jinchuriki. I guess he had whatever the opposite of plot armor is"
Naruto,fqgx1qm,t1_fqghzhn,1589360110.0,Yeah but everyone knows sakura being in that battle and not instantly dying is a joke lol
Naruto,fqgggn1,t1_fqgg3n5,1589345641.0,Yeah i dont think kishi thought it through when he made the first hokage literally almost kill madara weilding kurama yet hiruzen was supposed to be stronger. Dont get me wrong he was no schlub but he wasnt on madaras level i mean even minato had problems dealing with kurama and i dont think for a minute hiruzen could take minato
Naruto,fqgfzgb,t1_fqgfvef,1589345294.0,Yeah makes sense i guess
Naruto,fqgffcp,t3_e2ss2l,1589344891.0,Shikamaru looks so much like his dad it makes me wanna cry
Naruto,fqge3j8,t1_fqgdn0o,1589343936.0,Not perfect but i thimk it would be cool to see both obito and madara's screen time be meaningful instead of one of them just kinda standing there while the other is fighting

Hulu,fo7wzqz,t1_fo5u2y2,1587585986.0,"That's correct. In my case corrective lenses won't help though. Blindness is a spectrum and people don't seem to realise that. Also, if my vision was worse than it is now, i could simply use the Talkback feature on android or voiceover on apple. Accessibility programs allow blind people to do virtually anything on a computer or smartphone"
Hulu,fnnewkl,t3_etazfl,1587090780.0,Really sucks for people like me who are legally blind and love dubbed anime because the 2d format is easier to process quickly and the storytelling and artistry is far superior to western media
