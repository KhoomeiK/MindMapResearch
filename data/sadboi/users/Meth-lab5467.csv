Quite frankly, the pacing in the latter half of the webtoon has been it's downfall. I don't hate the road they're going down with John. I actually think him have mental issues which don't disappear magically is a nice plot line, however the pacing drags this concept out for so long that it feels as though he won't change (I mean he's yet to), which sucks. I think if they paced it properly and the author tried improving her art it would be an even larger hit"

When I listen to it now, it just kinda feels like the album was re-written so many times idek what it is. I liked LUV vs the world 2 a lot more, but then again Uzi just released that for the fans, considering he left a lot of fan-favouritess off EA"
