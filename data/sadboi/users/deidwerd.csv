That's how it feels. All the life and noise and chaos and color of the world being pulled down into this cavernous hole. This rushing, staticky noise that consumes all other sounds. And it feels like, no matter how hard you try to squeeze it shut, it keeps getting wider.
Just breathe. Just breathe and try to get through it. The hole never completely closes, but some days it becomes more manageable."

I'm right there with you on wanting to check out from this reality. But, tomorrow? I might meet someone who helps it all make sense. I may learn something that pulls it all together.  There may be a brand new ice cream flavor that I would have never tasted!! It may never get better, but there is always that tiny chance that it will. Hold on"
