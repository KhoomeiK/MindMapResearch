I didn't get to take any anthro classes in undergrad (although a few were cross listed but very obviously sociology). My major is psych and minor criminology (very social justice oriented), and most of my psych research experience has been with a cross cultural lab. 

Sociology has some offputting foundational elements but I think that much of what is considered essential nowadays is much more critical of the role of systems in underserved populations. There is some phenomenal research in the field these days relating to all aspects of human life (especially environmental trauma, the role to the police state, and other pertinent issues affecting poor and minority individuals and communities).

Cross cultural psychology was one of the better classes I took because it was so foundational. It allowed me to understand topics like health disparities/inequities much more throughly. 

If you could recommend any good books that you remember I'd love to put them on my list."
