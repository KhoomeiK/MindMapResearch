depression,eyn8pmn,t3_cxt07l,1567236603.0,I loved Coldplay and still do but I’ve noticed that lately when I feel down I always go to Ryuichi Sakamoto. It’s mostly piano but when I play it when I feel down it feel like I can connect to the music. Something I rarely do.
depression,eyn8kxz,t3_cxt4g7,1567236435.0,Every time I post on here I always delete it the day after once in sober. This time in going to keep it once I wake up. I always get nervous when I post on here. Sorry about the rant but this place I really feel I can post without anybody I know seeing it and judging me.
depression,eyn7zq5,t3_cxbnat,1567235695.0,"I’ve been going through part of my life where I notice that same mindset almost everyday. This summer it was very apparent to me because it was a tough time for me and for once I let my parents see a little bit of what goes through my head. I never had the balls to actually admit to anything but I always think these days how I may be mentally ill but I’m still too afraid to admit to anything. I think as I get older I’m starting to realize that I am mentally ill but the hardest part for me personally is admitting to myself that I actually need to seek help. For me I feel like the leap to actually taking to someone is the hardest part and it’s probably the same for many others. As I type this I realize that the only reason I’m typing this is because I’m alone and able to comfort myself through this, even if it has little impact."

airsoft,epoqmx9,t1_epoq5y6,1559350528.0,It shouldn’t because I put a couple of layers of clear enamel after the base coat. The only place it’s kinda chipped is near the mag release that you can see. I got too excited to put it back together and chipped a bit when it was still curing when putting a pin in

airsoft,epngzqc,t1_epnazxt,1559327303.0,My gun is metal so I didn’t put any primer or activator for plastics on it. I left it as black and you can kinda see it near the mag release cause I chipped a small bit when putting a pin back in.
