13ReasonsWhy,f8xyz1o,t3_e2o6gy,1574938239.0,The fact that they'll be finished filming in early December pretty much confirms the speculation that season 4 will only have 10 episodes right? Looks like it.

13ReasonsWhy,eymdoan,t3_cxn1ny,1567206146.0,"I completely agree. I don't hate Zach, I think he's a good person deep down. But it annoys me how much of a coward he is and how he always directs his anger towards Tyler."

13ReasonsWhy,ey1ozvv,t3_cv3tma,1566706107.0,"I agree, but I was pretty surprised how little he was in the season considering he was promoted to a regular."
13ReasonsWhy,ewvyu8i,t1_ewvwxwx,1565816840.0,That's a good theory. I really hope they explore Monty's back story this season.
13ReasonsWhy,ewvutc0,t1_ewvr78m,1565814412.0,Now that I look at it again it kinda looks like Justin. Who knows. I'm probably overthinking it ðŸ˜‚
13ReasonsWhy,ewvr78m,t3_cqeqbd,1565812244.0,I'm pretty sure it's Meth Seth.
13ReasonsWhy,ewvnq8t,t3_cqblgt,1565810163.0,Looks a lot like Meth Seth to me when I look closely and turn the picture upside down. I think Justin probably kills him. Doesn't look at all like Bryce IMO.
13ReasonsWhy,ewmtnq9,t3_cozjtc,1565560247.0,I've also noticed in 3x11 and 3x12 there's a homecoming attendee and that's the only time they're listed in the entire season. Maybe we don't actually get to see what exactly happened to Bryce and all the things that went down at homecoming until late in the season? People are assuming we'll get to see his death in the first episode but I think the season will start with him already dead and we'll see flashbacks along with present time like past seasons. Especially since the season takes place eight months after season two which would be December and homecoming is usually in September.
13ReasonsWhy,ewcvfo0,t1_ewb2l2l,1565290930.0,If you don't mind me asking how do you know this? I'm hoping Meth Seth gets beat up again this season.
13ReasonsWhy,ew5tq76,t3_cmkpcu,1565144862.0,"I don't think Tyler is the killer, but I'm intrigued by your theory that Clay will get convicted even though he's not the one responsible. On one of the last days of filming for season three, >!Dylan Minnette was seen wearing an orange jumpsuit. If you look at the credits for 3x13 on IMDB, there's a prison guard listed also!<. I really think Clay might either get framed or be in the wrong place at the wrong time and be the one convicted for the murder. Then early on in season four we'll find out who actually did it. That's just a theory I have."

13ReasonsWhy,evrszty,t1_evrh93s,1564717583.0,How do you know this? The part about Bryce dying in episode 6. Can't find anything on IMDB.
13ReasonsWhy,euyvrhr,t3_cf2bi9,1564109143.0,"Great digging. They've said that season 3 will be out in the summer and while September is still technically summer, they're filming for almost the whole month and if the plan was to release it then, they would have to release it at the very end of the month when summer is definitely over. That leaves August. They're filming for almost the entire month there too but as you've stated there's have a small break from the 15th-21st. 

That can't be a coincidence. I'd be very surprised if August 16th wasn't the release date as that's the Friday. There's literally no other time they could release it where they could do press and not conflict with season 4 filming while it still being summer."
13ReasonsWhy,eurufwe,t3_chbwo8,1563999103.0,"It's not listed because no one knows the release date quite yet. I'm almost sure it's coming out on August 16th. They're filming season 4 during the whole summer and there's not much of a break besides from August 15th-22nd. They don't have much time to release and promote it without conflicting with filming of season 4 since they've said it'll be out this summer.

While I understand September is still technically summer, everyone goes back to school in early September and I don't think many consider it summer anymore. Even if they did plan on releasing it in September, they're filming from August 22nd-September 22nd so there's almost no time to promote and release it in September without it coming out very late in the month and by then summer is definitely over.

That would leave sometime in August. They don't have much time in August either. They're filming for almost the whole month but as I said they have a week break from the 15th-22nd. That can't be a coincidence. I think that's when they'll release it. The 16th because it's a Friday. I think we get a trailer by Monday. Based on all the digging I've done I'd be very surprised if August 16th wasn't the release date."
