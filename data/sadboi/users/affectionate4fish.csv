It sounds like YOU'RE the one over sexualizing gay people. We don't run around talking about how much we like cock or tits. We talk about how much we love men and women. How men are very soft and gentle and funny and smart. How women are kind and outspoken and beautiful and unique. Sexuality isn't about loving genitals. It's about loving people Jesus christ."

Women who are so obsessed with being married and actively protest gay people existing.

NoStupidQuestions,fqjn36t,t3_gixbsf,1589412307.0,"Me!!!

I had an interesting upbringing to say the least. After my dad died, my mom immediately married a woman (her fourth marriage now). They divorced within a year and my mom still claims shes not interested in women but I had two moms and my older sister and her now wife had just started dating so I was surrounded with women who just loved other women. It was never explained to me and I didn't need an explanation. It was just love

I knew from that point on that I loved women and men. It was just a fact of life. No questions. Just me. 

At one point in my mom's 5th marriage (to a man this time) she was making comments about how I can't have boys in my room and I commented ""y'know I like women too, right??"" and she brushed it off saying ""That's not true. You just say that because of your older sister"" and that was kind of it? Me and my sisters all go to pride together every year because none of us are straight and our (now disowned for drug reasons) mom is fully aware of this."
TrueOffMyChest,fqjm42k,t3_gj68s6,1589411904.0,"I appreciate that being active in the community is a choice and that considering yourself as apart of the community is a choice but something that I see a lot of that I don't appreciate is that people like you who don't really care to be apart of festivities and other stuff are the ""preferred gays"". Straight people much prefer gays who are quiet and keep to themselves because then they're able to ignore someones sexuality.
It's okay for your sexuality to be a huge part of your identity because it's an identity that has been shoved in closets and beaten into shame so now, in a time where it's more acceptable to be openly gay, I say if you want to show it off, do it! Make up for the centuries of shame and abuse.
If you wanna be chill and not really involve yourself, that's perfectly fine. I just don't appreciate how everyone likes silent gays more because they're easier to ignore."

You don't hate women, at least I don't think. You seem traumatized because you were shunned by the women in your life who were supposed to love you unconditionally because of something that's in no way your fault.
Take some deep breaths. It's going to be okay. And tbh, if you'd prefer to keep your distance from women for a while, I think that's totally justified. 
If you can, try and go to therapy. It sounds like you could benefit and just don't be violent or rude towards women because they're women.
