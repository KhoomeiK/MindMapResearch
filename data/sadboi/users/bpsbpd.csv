BPD,fk8e1ut,t1_fk84j35,1583954319.0,"Look, you have your views and that’s great, I’m not trying to tell you you’re wrong or selfish. Let’s be respectful here. Therapy is helpful and can better my life and the life of my future children. I understand your argument, but it’s not going to change my views or opinions."
BPD,fk7zn6c,t1_fk7yjat,1583946602.0,"I do understand your reasoning, it’s just not the decision I’m making. I’m not going to tell you you should have children. I’m going to give my kids a better life than I had and I’ll help them work through whatever illnesses they may have- mental or physical. I understand you’re choosing not to have children and think that the chance of passing mental illness on to your children is too much for you to want to have your own kids. But I’m choosing otherwise, so that’s why I said to each their own :)"

BPD,fk7sk4c,t1_fk7csou,1583942818.0,"What is this “triggering” thing you keep mentioning? Is it similar to the autistic kids I worked with (but, obviously, different types of reactions and behaviors to the triggers)?

As far as triggering goes, I would say it’s individualistic, but when I refer to it I mostly just mean it “triggers” a strong emotional reaction. For some people it’s suicide ideation, some it’s panic attacks, some splitting, racing thoughts, dissociation, etc. 

Also, I feel like I read and understood contradicting messages from you about BPD. Can a person control it or is it out of their control? Is it both? Is it variable by the person and situation?

It’s variable by person and situation, for sure. Some psychologists, including myself, view BPD (and most mental illness) as a spectrum. For my mom, she’s on one end of the spectrum, and I feel like she has a lot less control and she may not even see her behavior as wrong or unjustified. She’s had it for as long as I can remember and never got the help she needed - and I think that’s a large reason why she refuses to get help, but that’s for a different day. In short, it’s difficult to explain what the control over emotions feels like because for me at least, I realize that I’m getting too upset and acting out and being irrational, and before I started therapy I feel like I had no control over that behavior whatsoever. I could see the destructive behavior and I knew I was the cause, even in the moment, but I could NOT change my emotion or bring myself down from that intense emotion. But, with therapy, and a lot of work, emotions can be managed therefore actions can be as well. 

For me, I strongly hate the idea or notion that a person’s behavior is out of their control (assuming they do not have the physiological or cognitive issues). It’s fatalistic and defeatist. It gives anyone the idea that they are hopeless. I would feel a deep sense of dread if someone told me I will never be able control my behavior. BPD never seemed to be that extreme - but only extreme for those like your mother or my ex who refused to get help. If it is really that terrible, then a person who gets that BPD diagnosis is basically being told they are broken and unfixable. Wouldn’t that be harmful for a mental health professional to tell a patient? But of it is really that bad, why aren’t people talking about it more? For me, running acros BPD was like lightning: I couldn’t believe her behavior was known and studied so much.

There’s a lot to say here, but I’ll try to keep it short. Diagnosing BPD is a big deal. There’s a lot of misinformation out there, misdiagnosis, and stigma- from both the general population and from clinicians. I, personally, do not believe anyone is hopeless. And I would never tell any clients that they’re hopeless or have no chance of controlling their behavior, but I would ALWAYS tell them they have to put in work in order to do so. And that goes for every mental illness out there. There is medicine that can help; like mood stabilizers and antidepressants as well as anti anxieties, but studies have shown DBT to be the most effective treatment for BPD and that therapy has much longer lasting effects than medication- even when no longer in therapy. Being told you’re broken and unfixable is surely a feeling one might get when given a BPD diagnosis, but I think it’s important to remember that’s misinformed. I have met and heard of clinicians who refuse to diagnose someone with BPD because “they’re too nice”. This is insulting to the person, the diagnosis, and it perpetuates the stigma. People with BPD feel emotions intensely. I like to compare it to someone with a third degree burn. If you lightly blew on their burn they would freak out and be in a lot of pain. Emotions are like that for us, but that means we feel empathy and we can resonate with others well. We feel love intensely as well. It’s not just all the bad emotions. The good news is, there are therapies that can help- dialectical behavior therapy for one. DBT is relatively new and there are very few practices in my state that provide correct components of DBT which include info and group therapy as well as a one-hour phone session weekly. It’s intense, but it does have a high response rate in BPD. I’m going a bit off the rails, but BPD can be managed, you just have to work at it. There are medications that can help stabilize the mood and help with suicide ideation. The fact that this community exists here makes me hopeful that the conversation surrounding BPD can change and people will stop viewing us as unfixable or hopeless or monsters who don’t have feelings, when in reality, it’s the exact opposite. 

Lastly, my friend (the one I married to his wife) who recently became a psychologist, also said the thing about trauma. That she likely experienced some trauma and her behavior is a result of that. She says she never did. So do her brother. So does her parents. Can someone have BPD without trauma? Her parents say she was born this way. Her brother is very mentally healthy and happy.

BPD is thought to be a trauma response, but it’s also possible that it could be hereditary, though I haven’t seen a lot to support this. There’s not a whole lot of certainty here, but I like to think of it as a response to trauma. She may not have experienced “trauma”, but she also might have experienced something that she’s repressed and did not tell her family about. The response can come from big T trauma or little t trauma. I have heard of some cases where it could be something minor, that felt like a big deal to the person at the time. Such as feeling left out by their friends at school. Another that’s a bit more extreme, but some don’t consider trauma- especially not until recent years- is being bullied. If she was invalidated a lot, that’s another factor in the way she feels and responds. 

I hope this clarifies and doesn’t just confuse. BPD is intricate and in depth and it all stems from emotional dysregulation. It’s difficult to explain if you’ve never experienced it yourself."
BPD,fk7405b,t1_fk72y75,1583927009.0,"While it’s possible it’s hereditary, most studies have shown that’s it’s a response to trauma. It can look hereditary if the mom has BPD- their behavior can be abusive, just like in my case with my mom, and therefore child can develop BPD from said trauma. It can be cyclical."
BPD,fk731v6,t1_fk730es,1583926163.0,Having mental health issues does not mean you should not have children
BPD,fk6yfij,t1_fk6xzag,1583921532.0,"Same here! I don’t have kids yet, but I’m putting in immense work and effort to be able to better manage my symptoms in hopes that my children’s won’t develop it. My SO has bipolar II, and I’m afraid our kids don’t have any fair chance. But my boyfriend and I are both high functioning and have healthy coping skills, so  I’m hoping that if our children do have either mental illness we will be able to provide proper tools and get them in therapy/medicated if need be to help them better. I refuse to be the parent my mom is/was and my biggest fear growing up was becoming her. It was difficult dealing with my diagnosis, but I’m determined to put in the work so my children will hopefully not feel the way I did growing up. Wow, that was a cluster of thoughts haha! It’s 3am here and I can’t sleep, but my thoughts are just getting jumbled, so bare with me."
BorderlinePDisorder,fk6y2fs,t3_fgmwzl,1583921130.0,"Oh yeah, I do this all the time. It’s difficult to deal with for sure! It’s hard to put into words the anger because it feels rational, even when you know it’s irrational and then the aftermath! The guilt and shame and feeling like you’re crazy. Yeah, it’s tough. Dialectical Behavior Therapy is the most effective for BPD, but make sure it’s an actual DBT program and not cognitive behavior therapy 😊"
BPD,fk6xndr,t1_fk6s428,1583920658.0,"This is accurate; my mom has BPD and it went undiagnosed until she was in her fifties. I was the target of her abuse and was diagnosed with it myself. I study psychology, so I knew she had it before she did and I knew when my symptoms were getting worse it was time for me to go in a talk with someone so I could get proper treatment and heal. Unfortunately, my mom still refused treatment, and I just pray that I’m the only one of five kids that developed it."
BPD,fk6xczw,t1_fk5r5v2,1583920322.0,This is definitely worth its own post! Post it on this subreddit and I’m sure there will be many people giving you their knowledge 😊
BPD,fk6wtco,t1_fk5ezpi,1583919670.0,"As someone who was/is on both sides of BPD, I completely see where you’re coming from, but would like to expand. My mom has it and for a long time I was extremely resentful and angry at the way she treated me. And there was a time when I would have made a post just like yours...not on this subreddit 😉 but, just like yours nonetheless. Reading through your post was triggering for multiple reasons, but the first was how much I resonated with your response to your ex’s behavior. That anger and confusion and sadness. But my second reaction was hurt because as someone that also has BPD it’s hard to read. My mom is mentally abusive and while I know her behavior is out of her control because her mood is out of her control. Being diagnosed with the disorder myself makes it easier for me to relate with her and because I feel similarly to her, I do know that it’s hard for her and the guilt that goes along with her bad behavior is difficult to deal with as well. But, I have spoken with my mom about the symptoms and the diagnosis, and why I think she would benefit from the right therapy, and that it could help her feel better, she refuses to. She won’t accept her role in my abuse and she won’t get help in managing her emotions or helping herself feel better, or at least to be able to cope with the disorder. Because of this, I can hold her accountable for that aspect, even though I don’t hold her accountable for her emotions or behavior because I know how difficult it is to do. But, because she refuses to go to therapy and because her behavior makes my own BPD symptoms worse, I’ve set very strict and clear boundaries with her. 

I would like to preface that I am a psychologist, so I have a lot of knowledge and understanding of the disorder, not just because I have it. I think it’s important to remember that BPD is a trauma response disorder. Like PTSD or DID and your ex might not even know what trauma, or that she even experienced trauma. And that ~most~ of us who have BPD KNOW we’re being “crazy” or irrational but it’s so difficult to respond differently - especially if we don’t have the tools to be able to work through our intense emotions. Dialectical Behavior Therapy has high success rates, but the person going to therapy has to put in work and they have to want to change. As someone with BPD I can tell you that it’s easy to feel like you want to change and sometimes it’s the most difficult thing in the world to put in the work. 

Because I have BPD I can also tell you that those of us who are putting the work in to change are so very easily triggered by the post you made. It generalizes the disorder and because we all can share overlapping symptoms or feel extremely similarly to each other it’s difficult for us to not immediately feel broken or unlovable or hopeless or like the post is personally attacking us because we (or most of us) show these signs or feel like we do even after therapy because the emotions we have are extremely difficult to process. 

I think it’s important to also remember that one of the main criteria for borderline personality disorder is fear of abandonment. So we act out when we feel as though we are , or could be, being abandoned. Your ex would get mad about you cheating because she was afraid of being abandoned. She was also splitting, or black and white thinking. Which is so difficult to handle on Bothe the giving and receiving side. When splitting, it’s impossible to feel like the “person who is  cheating” is the same as the “perfect boyfriend who does everything right”. They’re two people, it’s compartmentalized. I have black and white thinking and it’s hard for me because I get so pissed at my boyfriend for being abusive -though he’s not- and I’ve decided I’m going to leave him, but I have to remind myself that he is the same person who is incredible and attentive. It’s hard to remember in those angry moments and that fear of abandonment kicks in. 

While I’m not trying to justify the actions of your ex, I do think it’s important to remember that BPD is a difficult diagnosis. It’s hard to have and it’s often difficult to have relationships with those who don’t put in hard work. That work is difficult and grueling and we often don’t feel like we are good enough, even when we might know it’s irrational. The stigma behind BPD and the fact that so many people have bad experiences with one person and then generalize everyone with the disorder is CRIPPLING. 

BPD is a really difficult disorder to explain how it feels if you don’t have it, but the original post did a pretty good job. If you read through it with the view of you, yourself, with the disorder, instead of immediately thinking of your ex, think about how that might possibly feel. It’s difficult and we already feel like we aren’t good enough. 

If you feel like you need to vent about your ex you should find a different subreddit, I’ve seen them out there and it’s extremely triggering for me so I try to avoid them at all costs. But if you’re wanting to ask questions or trying to understand the disorder better this could be the right place for that, but try to be mindful that the community here are people who have BPD and are here to support each other. 

I’m going a bit off the rails and I still don’t feel like my original thought or point was made, but I can’t remember it anymore 😅. Basically, just be kind when thinking about your ex because odds are she was not trying to abuse you, she was afraid of losing you."
BorderlinePDisorder,fjpkd40,t3_fbg4m9,1583553146.0,Haha what do you mean?
BorderlinePDisorder,fjmdujk,t3_fdn6zm,1583467916.0,"To me, this sounds like black and white thinking, or splitting! I would take those feelings as they come and try to tell your rational mind that they’re people and they’re not all bad. If the feeling persists maybe find a new therapist and see if the feelings carry over the a new clinician!"
BorderlinePDisorder,fjivcep,t3_fdn6zm,1583376590.0,"This is a classic sign of splitting, or Blake and whit thinking in BPD. Do you also feel like they’re incredible sometimes? Or is it only ever just that they’re bad?"
BorderlinePDisorder,fjiv56z,t3_fdngh7,1583376459.0,"Hi there! I’m a psych major as well and was just recently diagnosed with BPD even though I knew for a while it was something that I had. One thing that I would suggest is to ask your therapist to go over all nine of the criteria of BPD and explain to them if/why you think you fit that criteria. Why behaviors you exhibit for each specific criteria. If your therapist doesn’t have any real reasons to not diagnose you or thinks you’re “too nice” or doesn’t want to label you, R U N and find a new therapist that’s willing to listen to you do you can get the help you need. To me, this sounds like classic BPD symptoms and I suggest talking to your therapist about it."

This is disgusting, but something he does that quirky is he eats my hair...like finds strands of hair around the house (and my hair is long!) and he eats them.

You don’t need to come back with an attack to me, I’m simply saying that not everyone who is abusive has BPD and not everyone with BPD is abusive. My boyfriend has bipolar and I promise you there is plenty of stigma and stories for those with bipolar as well. My whole point is to just try not to label people or group them into categories without the whole story or more information."

I am a psychologist and I ALSO have BPD. Reading through this did not make me automatically assume BPD. There’s a lot more to life and to the disorder than this one story you’re reading. Please try not to be so quick to label people with BPD. It’s a very serious mental illness and it already has enough stigma, we don’t need to add to it."
BPDSOFFA,fj6pxd6,t3_f63gdf,1583077599.0,"It could be dissociating, or just too overwhelming for her for the time being.

As for anxiety, there are plenty of different medications that can help, including SSRI’s. SSRI’s don’t work well for me, they make my suicide ideation and depression worse, but they tend to work for a lot of people. Talk with a psychiatrist about your symptoms and I promise you they’ll try their best to find a combination of medication that works well for you, individually."
BorderlinePDisorder,fj6nsl2,t3_fbgpyy,1583076320.0,"Something that has helped in my relationship so far is talking to my boyfriend about what we need from each other. I have BPD and I used to be completely unable to communicate how I was feeling or if I needed help- I used to just lash out and he had no idea what was happening. But I’ve worked at it and now can communicate both of those things. I suggest having a conversation with her and brainstorm ways to help each other. Ask for patience from each other as you’re both navigating through a relationship that’s going to have ups and downs. Something that helps me is being able to recognize when I start to feel upset and asking my boyfriend for help so it doesn’t escalate to a place of no return, or to the point where it feels impossible for me to control myself. We’ve decided that physical touch/contact is a great way to bring me back to reality and it’s something we just implemented. Also, if she’s not going to therapy suggest DBT. There are also DBT workbooks on Amazon that are helpful."

But I still went in to see someone in order to get a second opinion and be diagnosed so I could get help. Oh highly suggest talking to someone if you feel like this is something you might be struggling with. Going off your story though, that’s only one snapshot of your life, it’s not talking about any of your emotions or any other symptoms whatsoever, so I would not feel comfortable even considering a diagnosis off this alone. Your age also plays a role in diagnosis and in the obsessing feelings. Feel free to reply to me if you’d like to talk more about this though. I’m happy to share my knowledge."
