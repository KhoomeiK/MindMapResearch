The next 2ish years we continue with couples therapy to try and work it out. He basically drags me along the whole time, too scared to lose his ""best friend"", but too scared to admit he doesn't see loving me ever again. (Our therapist sucked).

It took talking to a lot of other people with chronic illness to accept that someone can be an asshole even if they are sick. I excused a lot of behavior I shouldn't have ""because he was sick"". 

I feel like my ex died and got replaced by a pod person. I miss his family a ton, we were close. I miss my ex's dog a ridiculous amount. I feel like a widow without a gravesite to visit and morn.

It's been about 3 years now. In trying to find a new therapist, am on Zoloft, and cry at least once a day- sometimes all out sobbing, sometimes just a sniffle. I've tried dating again, but have had 2 dates in one year and neither worked out beyond a first date. 

I have a good job, a new house, and the best friends I could have every asked for, but I miss who my ex use to be. I didn't even really get to celebrate being married because I was in and out of the hospital worried sick, and then fighting and dealing with his new mental health issues. 

I want to be able to trust people again, but I'm afraid I'll never find the kind of love I had with my ex before it all went to shit. I'm almost 40 and don't want kids. I feel like I missed my chance."

Choosing not to have kids is weird. Choosing to go the IVF route instead of adopting is unheard of. Kids are all people talk about and they assume you have them. 

Contrast that with my social group - it's full of weirdos, queer folks, and parents who do not assume you have to have kids and are respectful of that. A lot of the women in my social group don't have kids. We don't hide behind phrases like ""I'm focusing on my career"", we just say ""I don't like kids"", ""I don't want kids"", ""Kids aren't for me"". 

There are some people kind of like me at work, however they hide themselves more than I do. They are not white and/or queer but not out at work, and/or not originally from the US. All of us hide some of ourselves at work because we have to. I'm only out at work because my coworkers are liberal-minded folks and I'm active in the LGBT group we have at work. 

TLDR : My running theory is that is comes down to class structure. Rich people are going to have kids because they can afford it and can pay for ways to make raising kids easier (nannies/fancy schools/not having to worry about food). Young people are seeing more of the struggle because (at least in the US), we're all kind of screwed. Thanks, Boomers."

It might mean that you are actually able to save for retirement instead of dumping it into schooling and child care. For me (38F) it meant that I was able to go from lower middle-class to middle class lifestyle. Lots of factors in play when it comes to income in these times.

If you decide to not have kids, be warned that you will have a hard time finding someone to date unless you're ok with them already having kids (which makes the extra money bit pointless).  

Also, it shouldn't be all about the money- that's  short sighted. For me, I knew I didn't want kids when I was 13. Over the years I've had to realize that I may grow old alone. I know that thinking kids are going to take care of you when you're old is assuming a lot, but I'm an only child. I could very well have to take care of advanced aging on my own if I have a partner that passes before me.... and what if my partner needs help and I'm too feeble to do that? You have to bet on outside help- friends? Are they still alive? Can they even do anything with their only families to take care of? 

Because I've never wanted kids, I don't really understand why people would want them (that's just how my mind works, I'm not knocking folks with kids), but I do understand that it's not a small decision. 

I actually think my life would be better if I actually wanted kids. In this society it's still weird to not have kids. People look down on me, think I'm selfish, I honestly believe I'm viewed as ""not as mature"" at work than my coworkers (99% of which have kids).

datingoverforty,ff9hnm4,t3_es56kb,1579713222.0,"I will say it's not just men, it's everyone. I'm bi and the women and men I've interacted with on OLD all act the same. It's gotta be a culture thing, and I can't stand it.   
I hardly ever get any matches on any of the OLDs I'm on, and when I do get a match I get ghosted or they never respond. If I do get a response, once I ask them out for coffee/drinks they disappear.   
I feel like wanting an actual long term relationship is detrimental to actually getting a date which makes no sense to me. There has got to be someone out there like me, right? I mean, that's why I'm on a *dating* site. 

I have an active social life, but at my age (38F) everyone around me is already is in a relationship. I've asked two people out IRL since I started dating again (since the summer), but have been turned down. I later found out they both lied to me about being in a relationship (just be honest with me, geez!). 

I've concluded that there are no rules and thus it's hard to offer suggestions for help. What worked for me in the past might not now, and what didn't work might work now. It makes everything very frustrating."

datingoverforty,fengwam,t3_epwpcb,1579284427.0,"I expect more from a mate than I did when I was in my late 20s (was in a LTR for most of my 30s). I didn't really care about their job, living situation, or their health. I care about that now. I feel that makes me even pickier than I have been in the past. 

Really, I just want to be with someone who finds me attractive, I'm attracted to, and share the same values. But none of that matters if their life is a mess. I hate to say that because who hasn't been a mess at some point? But I can't handle that type of person anymore, even if it's just a temporary ""mess""."
OkCupid,fen1f36,t3_epw4yi,1579274820.0,"When I was in mid-late 20s I would compromise a lot with the people I went out with. It only led me to FWB or real bad relationships. I then met my exhusband IRL at a party. The marriage ended when he got diagnosed with an illness that led to a personality change (he ended the relationship, long sad story).

Pre-diagnosis and life falling apart, I would have told you that OLD was a waste of time. I made a couple friends, but never had any meaningful relationships.

I'm now in my late 30s (38F) with my life coming back together. Everyone I meet IRL is in a relationship or not interested, so I fall back to OLD. It's been incredibly depressing. I've only been on one date in almost a year, had lots of ghostings, and the type of person I would like to date doesn't seem to exist at my age (I'm childfree and wish to stay that way).

I also worry that I swiped left on someone that could have really worked out because they said something dumb on their profile, or maybe they just have bad pictures. I much prefer to meet people IRL, and I find when I do match with someone and suggest that I'd rather go for coffee than keep texting they disappear. At my age I'm not going to waste my time texting for weeks until I meet someone. I need to look them in the face.

Long post to say I'm not hopeful, but I'm also not giving up. I feel like OLD is the only way to find single people my age with my interests."

datingoverthirty,fds4jbe,t1_fds3y4k,1578694187.0,"I think there is a bit of a bias when it comes to who would be up for a tarot reading. I'm super generalizing, but most of my customers aren't men. However, after a couple drinks I'll usually get a few coming into to my booth. 

Guys usually ask about career stuff or come in with no agenda (as do most people, honestly). Love doesn't really come up that often in my readings."
datingoverthirty,fds40gu,t1_fds233r,1578693922.0,"Do I believe in the woo of it all? No. I'm not telling anyone stuff they don't already know, and I'm very upfront with that. The purpose of the reading is to bring out what in their head and talk through it. It's a great way to get through a mental block and learn more about yourself. If someone really believes in magic or religion or whatever, then I run with it. If it's real to them, then it's real. That's part of who they are, and I'm not going to tell them otherwise. 

And by ""real"", yes, they are real images with a rich and crazy history. A lot of the modern decks you see now are based on the Rider/Waite/Smith design from the early 1900s. If you go back a few hundred years you get a card came from Italy/France. It didn't start out as a tool for divination, and the card game is still played in France today. I could honestly go on for ages- I got into Tarot originally for the history of it before I started reading. If you want to go into a deep dive I would recommend The Encyclopedia of Tarot by Stuart Kaplan."
datingoverthirty,fds23yn,t1_fdrzbs9,1578693171.0,"You don't really need to go in asking a specific question. I read for a ton of people who've never gotten a reading before, and I tell them we can just look at where you are now and where you're going. The cards will start to tell a story, and whatever is in that person's head will come out. That also means you should be active in the reading - readers are there to guide you, but this is your story and if there is something that stands out to you in those cards then let the reader know. Tarot readers are reading you as much as the cards, and that's not a bad thing. We're trying to figure you out to help you out.   


I don't know where you're from, but if you have any local occult shops around your town they will usually have a reader or two there."

At a holiday party this year I had someone come up to me and tell me I was beautiful, but then added that he was in a poly relationship. 
The thing that really frustrates me is that I had it real good... I had a great relationship, got married, and then my husband got diagnosed with a chronic illness, personality changed, and left me.

I have lots of photos and a short but to the point profile description of who I am and my interests. 

A couple months ago I was so frustrated that I swiped right on everyone on Tinder for a couple weeks (bad idea, I know). But even then, I only got a handful of matches back. Most of the people that seem interested in me are people who are not monogamous which is totally not my jam. This goes for IRL too! WTF."

datingoverthirty,fde7kry,t3_eku40c,1578332920.0,"This is long, but sharing from experience - don't forget to focus on YOU. You can't help your partner if you don't care for yourself as well.   
My ex got diagnosed with a chronic illness a couple months after we got married. His personality took a 180 as well as his mental health. I really thought that with couple's therapy, his and my own therapy, medication, and our love/partnership we could endure. He ended up kicking me out of the house after 4 months of marriage. Then there was 2 years of trying to make it work only to realize that I was putting in more of myself than he was. 

It's been about 3ish years. I'm now on antidepressants and still going to therapy. I was left absolutely empty because I was dumping my whole self into being a caregiver/wife/partner/grieving.  I've been able to talk to people with similar chronic illnesses, and they've all told me in one way or another that you can be sick and still be an asshole. One person in particular made note that my ""he can act that like because he's sick"" is totally ableism. Having a partner, even one that is sick, is still a partnership. Both sides need to put work into the relationship. 

My point being, for anyone with similar struggles - get into couple's therapy. Also, take care of your own mental health. Read up on caregiving, and what those people do to stay sane. It really helped me when I was in the thick of it. And finally, make sure your partner is also working on the relationship. Just because they're sick or have mental health issues doesn't give them a free pass to treat you like crap."

The way I look at it, if someone finds it pushy or rushed, then they will probably view me as a pushy and rushed person. Those that don't see it that way, would be a better match for me. I'm not the type of person that let things linger, and that's not for everyone."
