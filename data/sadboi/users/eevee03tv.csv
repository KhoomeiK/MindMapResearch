Even then why would they bring back large aspects from a season most of the fan base doesn’t like? 

Javi is an alright character but after season 3, I’m not sure it would make much sense from a business perspective to continue a very unpopular part of the story that was wrapped up nicely. Nobody cares what Javi is doing his story ended, most people want to see AJ and Clem are up to."
TheWalkingDeadGame,fqzs3zg,t3_glmvuy,1589774069.0,"I absolutely hate the idea of Kenny returning when he died in the majority of paths in the last seasons. He doesn’t belong in the series alive anymore. Include flashbacks all you want, he just shouldn’t be alive.

I understand they “killed” Kenny in season 1 and he returned there but on screen deaths where you physically see him go down are very different than Kenny being surrounded.

If you wanted to use a season 1 character that has a reason to want to look for clementine there is a shit tonne of characters you could use.

1. Christa - her “death” was not on screen and she is actually taken care of Clem for the longest period of any character in the series except maybe Edith if you chose to stay with her. She also has a lot of mystery surrounding her pregnancy and clearly cared enough about Clem to sacrifice her life for her.

2. Molly - fucking awesome character and it would definitely be easy to believe she survived all those years. She did like Clem but looking specifically for her seems a little far fetched unless someone brought her up. Either way, she would be super fun to play.

These two are probably the best choices although there’s plenty of characters that we know are out there that deserve a chance to shine (Mike, Edith*, any of Clem’s season 3 friends who isn’t Javi, ect.) over someone who has died and had his character been absolutely butchered by now.

As for Javi, I’m not particularly crazy about him either and I think his arc ended nicely in season 3 but he’s still alive, so at least his presence would make sense. 

Having Kenny and Javi meet kind on a journey to find Clementine of sounds like super bad fan fiction."

Slycooper,fqp4zvr,t1_fqmjibm,1589535228.0,"I feel like in Sly 4, the characters either became completely helpless, a joke or complete assholes.

- Sly would go into the asshole category but only slightly.
Only because If it weren’t for the fantastic line delivery on Kevin’s part, Sly would have been completely unlikable. He never actually learns from his mistakes and it’s super frustrating that Carmelita forgives him despite him doing nothing to earn that forgiveness. Also he’s a complete dick to his family for no good reason, these are the same people he traveled around the world twice to learn more about.

- Bentley would go into the slightly helpless category because had to “gain confidence” despite having already gained having 2 whole games where he grew far beyond what he was at the end of the game.

- Murray is just a “lol he’s fat and dumb” joke, especially insulting because of how much he grew in the last game. It feels like he regressed to his Sly 1 self.

- Carmelita is just a completely different character. She falls into both the asshole and the helpless category. Her characterisation in this game might be one of the worst for a playable female character I have ever seen. She went from a strong, determined, black and white cop, that still understood when to put the law aside for the greater good... to a sassy, angry Latina and Sly’s crazy ex who misplaces her anger, gets kidnapped in situations she could definitely handle if she was in Sly 3 and says “ringtail” every five seconds. I would have actually preferred if she had stayed in Paris for the whole game, she didn’t need to be here.

- Penelope went from just kind of creepy but a harmless and intelligent partner for Bentley to a greedy, power hungry asshole. Let’s not forget, she really liked Sly in Sly 3 and her change in opinion literally came out of nowhere.

- Dimitri is just the weird and flamboyant guy. Although to be fair, he was always kind of like that. It’s difficult to get dimitri completely wrong. He’s less funny but he’s okay.


Except for maybe Dimitri and Bentley, the characters are practically different people. Sly 4 seriously needed better writers. I would have forgiven the gameplay flaws if the story wasn’t so poorly written."

Slycooper,fqm5wwj,t3_ggrvps,1589472046.0,"Everyone talks about Penelope and how her character was butchered but what happened to the rest of the group. All of the cooper gang regressed in terms of character development and if it weren’t for Kevin’s voice work being so charming, Sly would have gone into unlikable territory.  Carmelita is easily the most unlikable and worst change though.

Carmelita was a “by the books” police officer, who was extremely passionate about her work and competent but treated people in custody ethically and understood that sometimes you need to put the law aside for the greater good. She was a strong leader and determined. Carmelita is a very likeable antagonist/rival in Sly 1-3.

In Thieves in time she suddenly turns into a stereotypical sassy Latina and a damsel that is misplaces her anger on random people she doesn’t know and suddenly loves Sly at the end of the story again despite neither of them having any meaningful character development and any chemistry between the two that was abundant in the other games, is just gone. She is just constantly nagging and she becomes incredibly annoying to the point I would have preferred it if she had stayed in Paris. Her gameplay is also super clunky and boring.


Also she went from saying “ringtail” a few times in the entire series to **literally saying it every other sentence** and it’s so annoying!!! Also why is she wearing a skirt?? She’s on the job, that would be super impractical.

Doing otherwise would be kind of like having Lockdown for people but not telling anyone and just proceeding to arrest people without telling them why.

This method would only ever be justified if widespread education and changes to the law were *to happen first*, otherwise it would be harsh and just fucking sadistic.

Especially, not to mention the vast amounts of innocent cat owners who have missing cats that escaped by accident (my sisters cat can open windows, locks and doors - and can accidentally get out on occasion) or have been stolen and let out. 

Imagine if your cat was shot because a guest opened your window and you never noticed.
