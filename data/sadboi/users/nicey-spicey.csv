bipolar,fr3izww,t3_glv1tv,1589858441.0,I have been accidentally missing my doses due to routine through covid being all over the place and have plunged at max speed into a mixed episode. I feel heartbroken as if the love of my life has broken up with me yet am so excited to buy a house with money I do not have and change everything in my life. This is hard and annoying for anyone around me and I feel so bad.

Drugs,fmjkqyp,t3_fvnd1q,1586132286.0,"I (25F) blacked out last night taking 2-3 0.5mg clonazepam. I won‚Äôt do this again. 

At first I was being super funny and caring to all my friends who I was video calling. 

Shit hit the fan when I video called my sister and made a joke about her mum in law - called her a ‚Äòpsycho bitch‚Äô and laughed. We both started crying because her partner heard it, and I was trying to say sorry but it was aggravating him more and today they are having trouble with each other over this.  

I then became abusive to my boyfriend (23M) over text. Saying shit like I‚Äôm gonna come to your house and smack you over because he was ignoring my wasted texts. I NEVER act like this, EVER.

 I had no idea I took another 2 clonazepam over the course of the night as I was binge drinking vodka as well. 

I feel like an idiot today. I caused a meltdown between my sisters relationship. Luckily my boyfriend understands that it was the heavy drinking and the benzos that turned me into a cunt. 

Have apologised to both parties. But I can‚Äôt let go of it and can‚Äôt take back what was said after I started loosing the plot. 

Benzos are something else hey. I usually take one during a panic attack but never with alcohol involved. I probably won‚Äôt dabble like that with them again."
wholesome,fm2cbl3,t3_fsaqv2,1585694640.0,I miss my boyfriend. He only lives a few suburbs away but for the greater good we will follow what‚Äôs been asked of us in hopes it will work.. I hope the quarantine isn‚Äôt extended too much longer.

It‚Äôs not a bad thing to have mj around, it does keep the spark ignited when times are dulling and it‚Äôs there for ya on the constant. It‚Äôs your time here bud, and I‚Äôm glad for you that you have that kind of relationship with it. It was more a routine habit for me and wasn‚Äôt healthy anymore.. but if you enjoy and it helps with things for you without getting in the way, well we all need some sort of crutch,  hey!
