TheOA,fbi2qtk,t3_ed5n9r,1576889115.0,"I had a dream that I was on a bus with my friend and we were talking about The OA. He was sitting in the chair in front of me for some reason, so he had to turn to talk. He said that he only watched Part Two without watching Part One (probably in reference to the fact that he never watched any Marvel movies, but went to watch Infinity Wars with our friend) and he couldn't understand it. When I was about to explain the show to him, I turned and saw Brit Marling in her Nina white suit outfit and we talked about writing and storytelling. Just when I asked her about the other three seasons, I woke up."

She actually made me even more forgetful because she was only paying attention to certain things I said, interrupt me, then tells me to talk more about the thing.
She even had me schedule 4 appointments that day, saying I need to go to all of them. When I asked her what was the usual protocol for rescheduling if I can't make it to one, she lectured me about cancelling appointments and how one of her depressed patients cancelled on her and she said ""Well that's not going to help them, is it?""
And guess what? They rescheduled me 3 times and cancelled 1. So I stopped seeing her. I learned nothing and she only showed me coping techniques that I already told her I did (breathing exercise and journaling) and I still had to pay hundreds of dollars for that one day."
