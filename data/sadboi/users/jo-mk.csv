I thought that as just me.

My dad went in September from copd and cancer, I've said this to my man, and my sister.

""I'm soooooo glad that dad isn't around for this, at least he stood a CHANCE of good care then""

And I already know that you're gonna relate hard to that. It's a pretty shocking realisation and I was so sad to hear myself say that, but, it's my truth.

I'm so sorry if I've upset you there ‚ù§Ô∏èüíî"
AskReddit,fl1iqtl,t1_fl1fcc8,1584729808.0,"Because its just not that simple?

Source-my dad died September, both me and my sister would have moved heaven and earth for this to happen.

Terminal illness is a really hard thing for a patient to endure, they become weak, they have no appetite, they become weaker, eventually due to confusion and stuff, it comes down to what's best for patient.

Not what's best for the family. I'm grieving still now, this is still some raw shit to me, so I'm sorry if I came off like an arse, I didn't want that. ‚úåüèº"

CoronavirusUK,fl079hj,t1_fl03ysc,1584694665.0,"Agree entirely

My mum is 70 and my step dad is 72 in a couple of days. I've been asking them for weeks to please listen to me and take shit seriously, they're both diabetic, both athsmatic, both overweight and the step dad has a heart condition. 

And yet... They think they're bloody invincible???

Actually reduced me to tears Saturday, the frustration and powerlessness of it all.

""We've been thru stuff like this before Joanne, calm down, you're over reaacting, we will be fine, if we die we die, but we won't, cos we know what we're doing""

Menopause,fl04lc1,t1_fl04doa,1584691300.0,"Yea, I agree with you absolutely, the lack of control we have over this thing is what's been fucking with me too.

I've also been distancing, so I've been stuck in the house pretty much 24/7 for 8 days now.... With a 5 year old son.

Are you managing to sleep OK?

I'm finding that soon as I wake up, so about 5ish my mind literally fills with the unknown and then that's me, wide awake.

Keep yourself safe and sane. Best wishes from the uk"
