TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fqsb9gg,t3_gkgw7s,1589602785.0,"To me, it sounds like she and Jeremey are both talking about her addiction but have some mutual agreement not to outright talk about it on camera. They both seem like they are kind of talking in code, “My issues”. I get it. It’s hard enough to admit to struggling (with depression, mental illness, drugs, whatever) to the people in your life, but to do so on camera, knowing it will be broadcast on national television. I can understand why they are being kind of discreet. 

It also seems like MTV really pushed them to have this conversation and she’s clearly very uncomfortable with it. Also, he totally gets triggered by her mentioning him not being around. 

Ah, lots of observations from this scene. I kind of have a soft spot for Leah but don’t know why."

I felt like there was something really wrong with me and every time people talk about how hard this is, a tiny voice inside of me is like, “...but I love this”. I feel so safe. I don’t feel the intense pressure I normally would feel every single day. Zoom meetings and FaceTime are a much less overwhelming way to communicate. I can get more accomplished at home. I could go on and on. It’s felt so safe and freeing for me. I will miss it. I feel massive guilt/shame every time someone talks about how hard it is."

stepparents,f5jfqsg,t3_dnyutt,1572227284.0,"I'm so sorry you are feeling this way and I think your feelings are very valid. 

On a light note, I want to say that when it comes to food, kids, in general, are very wishy washy. One day my daughter absolutely loves a specific food, the next day she thinks it's gross. That isn't about you--that's just kids, in general. And if your SO was also rude about it, he may have just been feeling overwhelmed/anxious about the family event and drop off with BM?

That said, I felt this way a lot when my husband and I first started dating. It HAS gotten better with time and he's learned that certain things he said/did (like what you described above) were hurtful and unempathetic. He has made great strides to have more empathy and understanding and to pull his weight so that we are equals. I hope this will be the same for you, that things will get better. In the mean time, please don't let him invalidate your feelings or try to convince you that how you feel is wrong/""you should know better because you signed up for this"". No one really knows what to truly expect in these blended family dynamics!"

stepparents,f02w192,t3_d38zqq,1568339361.0,"I don’t have suggestions from the parenting end (though I am a stepparent). But, once upon a time, I was a teenaged girl with divorced parents. And I stopped wanting to go to my dad’s. And I STILL don’t know why. I just had zero desire to go and would avoid it at all costs. I didn’t feel comfortable there. My mom encouraged me to go and I still didn’t want to. My dad didn’t do anything wrong. My stepmother was difficult but that wasn’t it, I don’t think. I think some girls, especially those who aren’t with dad 24/7 may get uncomfortable. So, on top of mom doing some poisoning against you she (daughter) may also be going through some typical teenaged girl discomfort. 

I liked the suggestion above about putting the money you would have spent on her aside. Don’t stop reaching out and letting her know you love her and she is welcome when she’s ready but not pushing her. I think sometimes over doing it can push kids away further. I hope you figure it out and that she can get some therapy. Good luck."
