offmychest,fktg8c2,t3_fklsum,1584518397.0,"My 14yo son was mesmerized by it. He’d never admit to liking it, but it’s one of the few movies he’s watched all the way through."

AmItheAsshole,fk2fpqj,t3_fg4wwh,1583800038.0,YTA for acting like a 2-year-old who can’t cut their own chicken into strips. Just take the breast and learn how to use a knife ffs.
AmItheAsshole,fj23enb,t1_fj2306x,1582933563.0,"No, sorry if I wasn’t clear. It’s a friend group where we talk about any and everything. Our daily lives, cleaning tips, parenting issues, etc."
AmItheAsshole,fj1zmio,t3_fb2ss6,1582931340.0,"I’m not arguing with the YTA assessments at all-just giving more info. If I’m TA, I will take that. I appreciate all the comments and I think we have a good route to start on. Still not a doctor issue at this point, though we’ll see where she is in the growth chart at her next well-child visit in a few months. Thanks!"
AmItheAsshole,fj1zghd,t1_fj1zau8,1582931243.0,"If I had any reason to think she’d EVER see it, I’d never have shared it for sure. I also talk about personal stuff about ME that I wouldn’t want my kids reading. For now, I don’t even have a Facebook, so that’s not an issue."
AmItheAsshole,fj1z9rk,t1_fj1yxm2,1582931132.0,"This was a very kind way to call me an asshole. lol I appreciate your comment. I’d never call her a weird potato, but I think you (and a few others) hit the nail on the head. She’s probably getting close to a growth spurt and things will even out. I do watch drinks-we (as adults) only drink diet drinks and limit that to one/day because artificial sweeteners are crap, too. I drink a ton of water and have water flavoring available for anyone and a case of bottled water always available."
AmItheAsshole,fj1ye2w,t1_fj1y9iz,1582930599.0,"Wow, that’s actually a good point. I trusted them with a lot of my own personal information but now I worry that it will get spread around or whatever. I mean, I’m not that interesting, so probably not. But I should definitely be more careful. Thanks."
AmItheAsshole,fj1ya5n,t1_fj1y6d7,1582930527.0,"We have talked about that. She’s a social butterfly and I think she’d do great at team activities. She has mentioned one sport, but has never played it. I’m very supportive of whatever she wants to do!"
AmItheAsshole,fj1xyi1,t1_fj1xjpp,1582930313.0,I also have hypothyroid and pcos.
AmItheAsshole,fj1xtpm,t1_fj1xe0n,1582930227.0,"Yes, I do think my own issues play into my concerns. I would never judge her or love her any less at ANY size. I had concerns for my other child who is underweight but it turned out to be a medication issue. We saw a specialist and had dozens of tests run. She’s just not sick or anything so I didn’t want to subject her to doctor stuff yet. It’s not a huge problem by any stretch. I do feel judged by my own family, even now, for being overweight (and it’s not dysmorohia-I’m definitely in the obese category). I don’t give a shit what others think about me due to my children. I gave up caring about that a long time ago. It’s definitely just a parental health concern."
AmItheAsshole,fj1xarr,t1_fj1x4e6,1582929883.0,Totally makes sense. Thanks. I would never put her on a traditional diet. That’s just cruel. But just offer fun but healthy choices that kids may like. And we do walks together and she (and I) really enjoy those.
AmItheAsshole,fj1x5gf,t1_fj1wydd,1582929786.0,"Thank you. I agree and never thought about anyone seeing it. No one in the groups is local, but I know that doesn’t mean anything. She would never be able to see anything on MY phone (though she knew I took the pic and was fine with it)."
AmItheAsshole,fj1x0eh,t1_fj1wsjf,1582929696.0,I do belong to a gym but the minimum age is 13. She’s not quite old enough.
AmItheAsshole,fj1wyly,t1_fj1wg9k,1582929665.0,"Oh I agree-that’s why I’ve never said anything to her. I have had weight issues and obsessions my whole life, starting around that age. So I don’t want to see her go down that path. I have been very skinny and very fat, multiple times back and forth. It sucks. So I never say a word to her and have always just let her have what she wants. However, I was starting to feel like that isn’t the right approach. We do go for walks together, but no activity other than that. She’s not interested in any sports. And she doesn’t eat that great. My husband does most of the cooking but we have talked about offering healthier alternatives. We both eat fairly healthy and there always fresh fruits and veggies available. As well as cheeses and rice cakes (my fave snack!), etc."
AmItheAsshole,fj1wh29,t1_fj1w5aw,1582929348.0,"Thanks. This is a good perspective. Like I said, never had a teen before so this is new to me. I know children follow the growth curve and she did jump up on the curve."
AmItheAsshole,fj1wdhq,t1_fj1w6wa,1582929283.0,It’s a very tight-knit group of women who have known each other over a decade. No one gets let in. And the members regularly post pics of themselves and their families.
AmItheAsshole,fj1w8e8,t1_fj1w34a,1582929192.0,That made mad laugh! Definitely not an anti-vaxxer! We even do flu shots every year. I just didn’t want to go to a doctor for a minor issue. Just wanted some fellow mom advice.
bipolar,fj12q8j,t1_fj113ay,1582911973.0,"I don’t mind the questions at all. 


I have a saved response to this because so many people ask about it. Please forgive me if you’ve read my reply before. 

Please look into any and all other options before resorting to ECT. Save it as a complete last option. It did save my life, physically, but ruined it, mentally. I’ll explain. I was highly suicidal. It knocked those thoughts out within a couple sessions in the hospital. But I was still severely depressed, so they kept going. 40+ treatments later, I have no memory of my life before ECT. I often have difficulty coming up with the word I’m trying to use. I forgot how to knit, which I did as a home business and was very good at, and can’t seem to reteach myself. I’m no longer able to focus long enough to read a book, which I used to love doing. I typically cannot even follow a movie. I have to stick to hour-long shows or less. I have more anxiety-I’m not sure if it’s a direct cause of the ECTs or because I’m not confident in myself doing things like driving, going anywhere by myself, etc. 

I haven’t had an ECT in 2 years. I still experience depression. I refuse to do ECT again unless I’m literally about to die (if you know what I mean). 

Some people do not have these severe effects. Lots do. Just weigh out everything and make a fully informed decision. Good luck."
bipolar,fj103a0,t1_fj0p8j9,1582910628.0,Oh gosh I’ve tried pretty much everything except seroquel because of the weight gain. I’m Med resistant and have had dozens of ECTs.
offmychest,fj0m9k8,t1_fj0m36r,1582903162.0,"Well some
Guys like that. If it was rape, then that’s not cool, but if he’s into it...that’s his business."
BPD,fj0k5tr,t1_fj0juwb,1582901839.0,"I’m 40f and had never heard of it before being diagnosed 1.5 years ago. I’ve had bipolar for a decade, but this is a different beast. And I can’t just take a pill to fix it. Oddly, I didn’t have a traumatic childhood/life and my marriage is very stable (I hear that’s rare with bpd). My female friendships are definitely not. But my husband has been with me for 20+ years and we’re happier than ever (with each other). It’s just strange. I don’t know why I have it. Mental illness doesn’t run in the family (at least, not diagnosed lol). But I’m emotionally like a teenager, but have the insight to recognize it. I just can’t stop my knee-jerk reactions to shit that affects me."
BPD,fj0jrzp,t3_fattc0,1582901595.0,Can I ask how old you are and how long you’ve been diagnosed? You sound more mature than most redditors.
BPD,fj0jgnk,t1_fj0j8yg,1582901388.0,"Thanks. I didn’t mean to make this about me (I’m bad about that when I’m just trying to relate). Your post really helped me not feel alone. I even showed it to my husband said, ‘see, this is how I feel all the time.’ You’ve served a good purpose today and sound like a great person."
BPD,fj0j2rz,t1_fj0iv95,1582901136.0,"Oh they told me I hurt them. I came back with a sincere apology and was told it was fake and just to smooth things over and that I didn’t mean it. Then I got muted so I couldn’t even defend myself. A bunch of other shit happened, but I’ve been in this group of the same girls for 10-15 years. We raised our babies together. And they just dropped me like a sack of hot coals. Thank god I’m seeing my therapist in an hour because I’m in a really bad head space today."
BPD,fj0hl39,t3_fattc0,1582900144.0,"I felt this so much. I just lost a whole group of friends because they twisted my words and I became defensive as a protection mechanism. Now they think I’m unstable, crazy, bitch, you name it. They’ve resorted to online bullying and I’ve had to block everyone for my own protection. Did I play a part? Absolutely. I’m not perfect. My brain doesn’t work ‘normally’ if there is such a thing. I’m damaged and I have no idea who I am. 

You took the words out of my mouth: I don’t want to be like this. 

We can get better. I’m currently doing dbt stuff with my therapist (who is trained in dbt). Unfortunately, today was a HUGE setback. Luckily, I’m seeing my therapist in an hour!"

BPD,fizuq1a,t3_f91vmp,1582875508.0,"DAE constantly say things the wrong way and it gets taken wrong? I don’t know if people misunderstand my intentions or what, but I’m made to be a bad guy and piece of shit when I’m trying to be genuine. I hate this."
