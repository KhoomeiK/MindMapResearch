selfimprovement,f7msdzp,t3_dwywyz,1573872295.0,"Meditation can help you with that. Whenever you notice that you're mind is wandering off, notice it and gently bring the attention back to the present moment. I know if sounds simple and something everyone knows. But trust me. When you start doing this you'll start to notice some small differences. If takes time but you'll get there eventually! I meditate using various methods and sources. One I can suggest to you is an app called headspace. Give it a try with the free basic course and see how it works for you! üòÄ"

Yes! The server went from low pop to medium pop just a few days ago and we can already see a huge difference. There are players everywhere you go, the faction balance is on point and the community is really good too! There are some drama queens ofcourse, but that's just what it is. You get those kind of people everywhere. If you wanna have the real vanilla experience, where you group up with someone and then you meet that person around the world and chat for a bit, then DragonFang is for you!

By this i don't mean it should look totally ""flat"". It should of course have some chunky bits here and there. Bon Apetit!"
