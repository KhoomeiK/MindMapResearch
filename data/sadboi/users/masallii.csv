army,fd4j3gb,t1_fd49hlx,1578167929.0,"I would like to share my most painful story of my service. It was february and i have been in the mili for about a month now. ALL recruits have this called morttileiri AKA we go to woods to learn basics like to throw grenade how to run/dive and shoot in the snow. well every night we have 1 guy every hour going around our tent and ""train to look out for enemies."" well there is also this called ""Potero"" aka foxhole where you go to lay down and look for enemies. my task for the night was to lay down there in -30C for 2 hours without moving. i was so fking cold that i was in hypothermia and was passing out like every 5 min... well finally after 2 hours someone was swapping with me and i get finally go to sleep to warm tent. fuck that... our ""tent warmer"" didnt know how to keep tent warm and it was like sleeping in -30 all night haha. and i have an habit to take all my clothes off when im asleep. so i woke butt naked in my sleeping bag with fever and we still had 1 day to go so i was literally shaking for atleast 20 hours straight without any feeling in my toes/fingers/cheeks. never have i ever been so fucked up haha. plus when it got snow under my clothes it ofcourse melt and i was literally wet in -30 and i was forced to learn how to dive in snow for atleast 5 hours a day haha. to someone this doesnt sound bad but for me it was hell. would rather die in +30 than freeze in -30. i can also tell 1 good story but im gaming haha"
