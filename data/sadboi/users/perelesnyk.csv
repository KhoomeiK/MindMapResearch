About the same; the changes to the story felt unnecessary and took away some important context, especially regarding Geralt's ""butchering"" in Blaviken. It didn't have the weight it did in the book. Also underwhelmed by cinematography & the empty and un-lived in feeling sets in EP. 1. Just finished ep. 2 and the details picked up a lot (especially the scenes at Aretuza, they felt stylistically much more compelling), still having my concerns as a book lover though."
