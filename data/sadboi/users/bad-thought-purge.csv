Miami,exbxdgg,t3_crxxfm,1566139632.0,"I parked my car in a Wynwood side street and when I got back to it, a big raggedy dude was leaning on my door. He wanted $2 for rubbing alcohol for his foot.

I got in my car, and carefully gave him $5, after I had locked myself in and started the engine, and he hobbled away to buy some alcohol for his very prominent foot fungus.

Idk. On the bright side, this dude was basically watching my car, so my wheels were still attached when I got back to it. But it was definitely weird to see a stranger leaning on my vehicle."

Why didn't I stand up to her? There's a long list. She is bigger than me, louder than me, meaner than me, more insulting in a fight, physically stronger.

She loses her shit easily. She is bipolar.

I tried to get my points across and she shut me down.

How am I supposed to keep going when I'm physically and mentally exhausted?"

legaladvice,ev5ve47,t1_ev3fi1l,1564239202.0,"The neighbors seeking revenge with tainted meat, chocolate, etc. If their cat is attacked is a real issue, but I don't think your dog is actually going to kill the cat.

If your dog is nice to your little ones, they probably won't hurt the cat unless it really provokes them.

I have a german shepherd, a collie  and a cat. Collie dog has a tendency to run for the cat and grab her by the neck in her bite. The other one will just corner the cat. 

The cat has been alive and well for the last few years, she usually runs away or hides.

The only animals I've ever found dead in the yard are opossum, lizards, mice, and birds. And, I can't say for sure if the dogs did it."

Your dad isn't trying to ruin your life. I know you need to vent, but when little things like dishes hurt his feelings it's because he needs to know you care...

When he asked you ""why did you do that?"" Its because he was literally trying to understand you. He cannot read your mind. He doesn't want to lose you. He doesn't want to be blind to the things that cause you that much pain, but he can't help it sometimes. He isn't going to get it right away. It takes time, communication, commitment."

depression,ev35rz6,t3_ci9nqn,1564189705.0,"I feel like being cool with yourself and accepting that you will always seem like an asshole to certain others is part of what helps me cope with my own rejection dysmorphia. 

I like to think about how much I love certain things, and how there are certainly people out there who hate the same things, and how there are some who will definitely hate me, but that's ok, because I don't have to take their shit. 

And, if anything happens, if anyone actively tries to hurt me, I'll just have to defend myself or try not to take it personally. 

If people people are apathetic towards me, or it feels that way, I can get pretty sad. I used to journal about it. But then again, I think that being obscure or invisible is good for developing a unique perspective sometimes, it's like being a wallflower. 

There's this thought I have about authors and artists and movies, like, they are humans and they chose to give their attention to this message for me as another human. So it's like, by taking in art, I'm giving myself this author's approval? Cuz like, but publishing their piece, they offered it to me? Idk if that makes sense to anyone else but me. 

It is something that I find empowering, if it can help anyone else, that's a bonus."
