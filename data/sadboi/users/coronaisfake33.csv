Something about the Self construct in your psyche is somewhat dissociated or not able to perform its function the way that it does for most people. Instead, you feel alienated from yourself and thus you feel alienated from others. It's called a ""self disorder"". You can look it up and learn more. 

To me, this does not at all exclude the possibility that I am an alien. I feel like an alien, so there is something legitimate to it. It could be that being an alien caused my ""self"" not to function properly. Maybe not having a working Self makes you an alien.

Looking back, I believe the entity in my childhood home was there before we moved in. It was attached to the house or to the people that lived there, which makes sense because we were in a rough neighborhood. 

I have to tell you right now that you should do your best to stop trying to figure out what it ""wants"". If you notice its presence, ignore it as best you can. Give it as little thought as possible. Just go about your activities as normal and pretend it doesn't exist. I know that presences like these present an intriguing little mystery sometimes. Sometimes it is even exciting to think about why they're there, even if you get creeped out in the moment. But despite that, you have to do your best to ignore it. 

While you're ignoring it, you should go about reasserting your territory. Maintain your spaces, keep things clean and tidy. I know it sounds silly, but walking around naked can help (alpha move, shows you're not scared to be completely vulnerable). If you have a diffuser, put frankincense oil in it. It has a very clean, pure scent that will put your mind at ease which in turn allows your body to relax into its environment and to therefore reclaim it. 

It's a bit like a child who has done something wrong and is now trying to argue with you about why you shouldn't be so upset. You need to communicate to this entity that you don't at all care why it's there and that it needs to leave. It's your space and it can fuck off."

If necessary, actively refocus your attention on a completely different thought (a movie you've seen recently, your next meal, the bird you see on the tree outside your window). 

Try and keep to a solid, stable routine. Write down 3 things you want to accomplish in the day and then complete them, giving yourself plenty of opportunity to rest or relax in between.

So of course my mother continued to leave me with the kid from the time I was an infant until I was around 5 years old. 

I don't have any conscious memories of anything happening, but I was always being given gifts of candy and money by Uncle and this boy. From a very young age I was wetting the bed profusely and continued into adulthood (until I was around 20). I was also cripplingly afraid of the dark, had anxiety and identity issues, all from a young age (toddler). I was constantly getting bladder infections. I would cry if anyone saw me naked or wanted to help me in the toilet. I could not change in the locker rooms for swimming. I grew up completely dissociated from my body. 

So while I don't have solid memories of that particular abuse, I am 99.9% sure that something occurred."

You shouldn't worry about making the feeling stay. It will come and go. Just appreciate it while it's there."

Someone with a normal body weight can ruin their knees from over-exercise. My mom did. She was a thin/skinny runner in her 20's. In her 40's and 50's she underwent 3 separate knee surgeries and has to have biweekly physiotherapy. Someone who is obese is at a MUCH greater risk for injury than anyone else, even professional athletes.  You need to take it slow, I'm serious. 

If you're on a caloric deficit and do moderate exercise (you should be going for walks, and doing some LIGHT cycling) you will lose weight. 

Please trust me here. Be careful."

schizophrenia,fn1bi88,t3_fyjrf2,1586558610.0,"Hey, if you're in pain from exercising you should allow your body to recover. **Forcing yourself to work through injury is only going to make it harder for you to reach your fitness goals.** First thing's first, don't take pain meds just to try to get through-- exercise when your body feels ready for it, not just because you feel pressured. 

As for my personal motivation, it goes in cycles. It's funny you ask this question because just yesterday I was having a lot of negatives and cognitive issues. I basically couldn't move for the whole day, and when I did move I would just stand there staring at nothing while the world dissolved around me. I could not even enjoy music or stupid videos on youtube. **Sometimes, you just have to understand that there's nothing you can do.** 

A lot of the time, negative symptoms and lack of motivation come from feeling overwhelmed. Your body just shuts down, begging to be rested. So let it rest. Don't pressure yourself, and **take it one step at a time.** 

What you really need to be doing is learning how to seize the day when you *do* feel any inspiration or inkling of motivation. **Act on your motivations**, immediately if you can**.** If you feel any desire whatsoever to go for a walk, then get up right at that moment and start getting ready to go outdoors. You will give yourself positive reinforcement and positive pleasure this way, instead of feeling disappointed that you let an opportunity pass by, only to try and pressure yourself to make up for it later when you don't even feel like doing it and won't get any benefit from it because it feels like a chore. 

When you aren't motivated, try to do things that are clearly about rest such as brewing yourself a cup of tea and sitting down with a blanket and a book (if you're able to read in those states) and some relaxing music. **Stay away from addictive things when you're not motivated to be ""productive""**, because these things-- while usually mindless-- will actually provide a lot of stimulation and prevent you from resting, all the while giving your body a shot of dopamine that makes it feel like it is being productive. **It's more productive to just** ***relax*** **when you feel unmotivated.** 

**My advice boils down to taking advantage of the days when you do feel motivated, and allowing yourself to rest on the days you don't.**"

Schizotypal,fmxg2nm,t1_fmxcpoa,1586464324.0,"Corona the virus is likely ""real"", but it is not as deadly as they would have you believe. It's a scapegoat for a manufactured recession, once again so that the central banks can vacuum up all the losses. It's also a scapegoat to encourage people to beg for more surveillance. If you go on your city's subreddit you will see them all absolutely BEGGING for more government control and action. It disgusts me. 

This entire scenario will cause more people to be reliant on the system (grants, allowances, welfare). They are also conditioning people to get used to crises. They want predictable reactions from the public. They want to be able to do whatever they want and to say, ""Okay guys, crisis X is happening, stay indoors"" and they want to be reasonably sure that most people will do that and stay indoors. They want to restrict populations to clusters, where everything is provided for those populations by controlled organizations (grocery stores, hospitals, etc. Nobody knows how to take care of themselves anymore. If another crisis did happen, everyone would rely on the established system to get help.). They want to be able to cut off those supplies if/when they need to. They need people reliant and watching their neighbors. Disgusting."

Only insofar as it is compared against the average functioning.
