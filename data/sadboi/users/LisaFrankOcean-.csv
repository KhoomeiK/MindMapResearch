Now they’re attempting to reboot them via Paramount TV (their independent studio, not network) and Paramount Films. Some of those films, like Hitchcock, were Blockbusters, yes. But in this day and age a blockbuster is fleeting. When you think about Disney who has Universes that they can build out, it’s just non-compete. 

Paramount has struggled trying to get another huge blockbuster hit lately and a huge part of that is the upper level mgmt, theyre old school when everyone is is thinking progressively."
