(Autism runs highly in my family and my husband is autistic too, thus my sources, im well versed in many issues as my own family is diversely messed up) i bring this up to mention, my personal favorite stimm, is actually to play with peoples hair, like deep scalp/neck massage kind of “playing with their hair” (and i use to be a cosmetologist so I’m *good at it* lol!)"
Schizotypal,fqc2u7r,t3_ghyjhm,1589248965.0,"I spent a few hours with a specialist, first we started with background history.

He mostly just listened while I laid out my “life story”, with a few questions to clarify things along the way. My point of view on what happened, was what mattered, as in none of my family was there to talk for (over) me or contradict the troubles i faced (as some parents tend to do whenever their child begs another adult for help, “oh shush! You dont have it that bad! You were a HAPPY child! See this picture in my wallet? Does that face look depressed?!”) 

Reading my evaluation afterwords he also took into account my personal choice of style (its common to be considered “alternatively styled” in some way as a schizo and goes towards the diagnosis, dont go in your “sunday best” like its a court hearing trying to mask who you are, go in something you feel comfortable in and wear on a regular basis. Just an every day kinda outfit.)

Schizotypal,fqbv7ev,t1_fqbl14k,1589244562.0,"It took me a long time to admit it as well. My parents weren’t malicious in their abuse. In my case it was gaslighting about my severe auto immune disease (lyme). No one believes the 4 year old youngest of 5 in a poor family where the parents have to work constantly to pay the bills, and to top it off my next in age sibling was diagnosed autistic (same kind as my husband actually, its why i understand my husband so well) around the time i contracted the lyme. All that rolled up together lead my parents to believe i was faking it for attention, and they were frustrated and then pissed off at my audacity to continuously do this to them... until i was nearly dying in my early 20’s with several systems on the brink of shut down, the damage permanent. They didnt even start taking me to dr’s to get testing done (still took 6 more years, hate drs) until i kept getting fired from jobs for “fainting too much”. They believed my ex-bosses that i was messed up, before they believed me. I was an attention seeker, then i was lazy for calling in so much and loosing jobs that way (having bad health days with an undiagnosed disease isnt a valid excuse for a fast food joint) then i was a hypochondriac for going from specialist to specialist and admitting how deeply infested the (unknown) lyme had become meaning that all my systems had become ill in seemly unconnected ways that could never be fully proved by basic testing.

I still have a really hard time admitting even to my husband the extent of my daily torments from both my mental and physical conditions. Every part of me is sick, so every part of my life is effected, so it comes up a lot, and people who dont understand chronic illness (most people) simply cant seem to understand that “chronic” means im never going to get better, and that my “constant complaining” ISNT me being “a negative person” its really me thinking i can trust this person enough with the truth to let down my mask and be honest about just what i go through on a daily basis, and will until i die. Friends and loved ones DO make life better, but “love” will *not* re-wire our broken brains. (Or bodies in some cases) and those people who go into a relationship (platonic or romantic) thinking that their “love” will actually “fix” anything, are a huge part of the problem. (With schizotypals specifically) Those are the ones who get fed up with us when we inevitably stumble with our mental health, as we always will to some extent, no matter how medicated or healthy of a diet and exercise routine we have. They take it personal that their “love” wasnt enough. But in reality they are showing us they didnt really love “us” they loved the mask we put on when they were around because we’ve learned people only like the mask. And The moment we trusted them enough to take it off and be the real us, they told us we were horrible twisted things unworthy of love. 

These people i reference are mostly met in a schizotypals early adulthood, and they exacerbate our conditions making us lock ourselves up into a safe shell by our 30’s (this is a statistical likelihood for schizotypals but by no means a guarantee, if taken care of properly this CAN be avoided! All mental health takes work)"

Schizotypal,fqagily,t1_fqad91z,1589218682.0,"The reason it is hard for us to form those close emotional bonds, is because we are so afraid of loosing them again the moment we get attached. To counter that particular common symptom, just be very reassuring to him, constantly. Because he will *constantly* be worrying that he is being “too much” or “a burden” to you with his issues and quirks. Remind him of why you are willing to put up with his quirks, the things you enjoy about him, how much they overcome the negatives. Reassure him that you dont mind helping him through his mental disorder, as long as he tries his best to be open with you about how its effecting him and where his mind is, when he feels that he’s being a burden to tell you so you can calm his worries BEFORE he “pushes you away to save you from him”

Be prepared to have to reassure him frequently. Research leads professionals to believe that schizotypal’s happen when someone with a genetic predisposition to be somewhere on the schizo spectrum (as it is a spectrum like autism) are then subjected to child abuse/ childhood trauma from somewhere. The schizo child is taught by society that they are in fact too much, a burden, not worth the effort to love, and it forms our adult minds around this solidly held belief. It will be hard to crack through the protective shell an adult schizotypal has built around their heart, but as every person is slightly different, i cant give any more detailed advuce than that as his quirks/triggers could still be very different than mine (as our condition is formed by how we are treated as kids, and we were all treated bad, but in different ways)"

I realized it was hormonally fueled so isolated until i could be rational. Thankfully with his autism and ODD (oppositional defiance disorder which provides a similar rage effect as bipolar and pms lol but all the time, which he works very hard on and is no more his fault than mine is I’ll note) he completely understands my need to distance and waits for me to be ready to explain why i blew up calmly. Now i know better to just self isolate in my bedroom (which i have my own because my bp makes my sleep schedule weird were as his autism makes his clockwork, and im also frail from chronic physical illness too and hes a large framed man who accidentally crushes me in our sleep lol) whenever i feel the mass irritation setting in, let him know why, its cool :p

I do also flip flop between the irritation sensitivity, and being massively depressed in an almost post-partum way which i make the connection as its a hormonal discussion. I had to give up custody of my kid to my parents 3 years ago due to my chronic conditions, and it’s obviously the hardest thing i ever had to do and struggle with it all the time (to be a mom was all i ever wanted, my career was even going to be in home-childcare to better facilitate my stay at home parenting plans, all wrecked by my conditions.) so, it feels like a post-partum pain... like a child-sized chunk of my soul was ripped from deep inside my torso and is now just a gaping void, its edges sucking in all that dares touch it.

Which brings me to christians who act the same way about the christian god.

I bet there are soooo many schizos not being diagnosed, because they feel “chosen” by their own cultures main faith.

Sorry... sometimes with what we know about mental health and science, organized religion hasnt been dismantled as hugely toxic to society yet really upsets me...

Maybe even continued distraction from their issues as the injury continues to hurt while it heals, forcing the body to continue making more endorphins. 

But with sex the brain releases those chemicals in order to aid in social bonding, like skin to skin bonding between a newborn and the mother stimulates the endorphins that create the strong familial bond.
