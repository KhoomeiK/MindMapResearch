badwomensanatomy,fr2yrqk,t1_fr26zqy,1589846503.0,"I think an important step a lot of people miss is that it needs to be okay to not orgasm. It's the only way to stop faking orgasms. 

I'm just not going to get there a lot of the times. Yes, it's often cuz of the guy, and he can't do what I need, but that's why I'm like, I feel better if I can just say ""look, take the ego hit, you're not going to make me finish, and I just want to go to bed"" lol. Feeling pressured to finish (and lie) is a big problem.  

It's counter-intuitive, ""it should be okay if you don't get off too"" but I hope I'm clear that it's the step in the opposite direction. When the issue is not that guys don't want the woman to finish, it's that they don't reeeally care, not enough. They don't care, as long as she says ""yes, I'm done."" They don't want to have to put in the effort. But, if all they hear is ""the only problem is that guys don't want their partner to finish,"" then they can think ""no I would prefer that to happen of course!"" therefore they are in the clear and 100% a good guy. Except it's all an ego thing, they want to be able to brag about how they made women cum, etc. They also want to feel like they are a good guy of course, and it is good to care, I'd much prefer the men who ask at the end vs. the men that literally don't care enough to be bothered. There's this disconnect when it comes to men and sex a lot of the times, and they don't want to ask real questions, just what they have to in order to get the feelings they want - the feeling that they are good at sex and a good guy. They just want to have a good sleep at night. 🤷 

*It's okay that you didn't finish me too* in the sense that ""you need to be okay with the reality that you aren't that good at sex"" lol. You need to pay attention, it's not going to happen by itself, your good intentions get you in the door but nothing else. But also sometimes it's just not going to happen. Idk, vagina stuff lol. And if you actually care about my pleasure, you'll fucking listen to me!  Point is, majority of men are terrible at sex and either don't care or they lie to themselves. Which is worse? Idk, I just thank god that a side effect of my medications is low libido which some helpful guys have helped drive into the ground, solid zero, so I can just chill and not have to keep working on how to get men to talk about sex, because I swear I have perfected talking in a nice light tone and dancing around the topic, talking like I am to a child, and STILL. Getting a guy to even dare to consider the possibility that he's not good at sex head on (no pun intended lol), actually get him to accept it and not hide behind his pride wall that says *all men must be sex gods* OMG it's like diffusing a bomb - one planted by our society years ago."
sadcringe,fr2qg3c,t1_fr2em8z,1589841940.0,"Yeah they sound like a sweet person which is why it's r/sadcringe to me. They are just clueless and unaware of how that could make someone feel...and if there's a chance dude is reading this: I'd be creeped out, but more annoyed. Like, this is my home and my laundry room and now I gotta be watching out for someone? Now I'm on the line for interactions I did not sign up for, now interactions have an undertone that I did not consent to - I did not want my folding the laundry to send wrong messages. Now I know there's someone around here who may not recognize any place as ""not the place to try to advance your social network."" (My least favorite kind of people.) 

Even if I'm not the person who folded the laundry, now I'd be wondering if every guy I looked at, is he looking for someone? Aka could I accidentally be meeting eyes with someone who is actively looking for someone else...With someone who is clearly not 100% connected to boundaries and polite discourse, not 100% aware of how expressing your desire to do something is not *automatically* good/not-bad...even if your desire is NOT to hurt that person. **I'm not saying I think he'd do something to me, this is actually the opposite: it's about the unknown.** Not knowing what a dude is gonna do isn't fun. *""Well, this girl knows I'm not gonna rape her""* - good start, but not adequate lol.  Too many guys just stop there. 

Here's how to sum it up: he sounds like the type of guy who is unaware of social pressures and expectations. The type of guy who takes stuff personal, as in thinks that if I smile back or respond in a nice way (or fold his freakin laundry), it's because I like something about HIM, not realizing that I would do the same thing no matter what. The type of nice guy who would smile at a fellow guy passing by, get the polite smile and nod in return, think *what a chill dude*...only for the exact same interaction to occur between him and a passing woman, yet he perceives it completely differently and is unconscious of the disconnect, blindly accepting his feelings as rational, reasonable, truth. -> He felt feelings when she smiled back, therefore she must had done it out of feelings, etc. He had no feelings when smiling at the man. -> Man couldn't have smiled back with sexual undertones. (unless of course he thought he was gay in which case he'd also assume he was attracted to him lol, a problem I know gay guys deal with.)

Whenever there are perceived sexual undertones/implications: please everyone make sure it exists outside of your perspective. ""Good intentions"" are not enough. /end rant thanks for coming to my TED talk."

Like, does he not notice that he's listing **physical** differences? Males and females have on average different features, our genitals and reproductive organs obviously, fertility, as well as males on average will be taller with wider shoulders and more muscles (bigger blood vessels, more blood pumping to heart, etc.). Males usually have a higher center of gravity while female hips will be wider than the shoulders and be the center of gravity, etc. (Maybe if I list a bunch of right things with the wrong thing my argument shall be invincible..?)

What's not on that list is the brain nor emotions, and if there were, sorry, but ""aggression"" and ""anger"" are emotions (and men being so emotional and unable to handle it is what actually makes them dumber and die sooner). It's almost like these guys just use science however it suits them best! Know what's an actual statistic? Women live longer. Because men make stupid fucking choices, they have poor self-control because they aren't taught it; they on average smoke/drink more, take more stupid risks, aren't reasonable and careful, then they don't go to the doctor; they don't cope healthily with anger and aggression which allows stress to poison them; they get into physical altercations, etc. Interestingly, women may also have a stronger immune system due to the addition of the Y chromosome, research is still looking at all the advantages, it's cool.

You have a totally different situation in a lot of ways, since you never actually breastfed. I would be wary of reading the experience of all other mothers.

And I mean, just physically too. The milk came in but it never came out/physically exited your nipples, that's different.

It's also suuuper important that she continues to use her brain and focus on tasks that require thought beyond just physical activity. This time is a critical stage of her development right now. The brain is strengthening the neural connections it is actually using daily, while it prunes (destroys) all of the synapses that are not being adequately used. This is why it's easiest to learn a language (or establish a drug addiction) when you are young: you have more to work with, there are more available synapses and total gray matter in your brain, which peaks around age ~14, where after it steadily shrinks throughout adolescence. It's very important that her brain is not neglected, as I see many reasons for it happening in the next few years - and beyond.

TrollXChromosomes,fq7p0vl,t1_fq6lb5v,1589149361.0,"I think there are multiple reasons. (and I'm not upset, just figuring it out myself)

First, it's often not about the depiction of sexual violence, it is how it is used. I think we all hate it when a conflict feels very manufactured. A scene like that is created to leave a message. It's often just to move the story along, to prove the bad guy is bad, to force character development. (See Sansa in GoT outright saying that rape helped her grow up.) Why? Can't a woman be upset over anything else, it has to be what a man did to her.

We can tell when a director does not take the material seriously. Rape is often treated like any other physical attack, but it's not. It's far worse. Directors use that, because it's more dramatic than just the woman getting beat up, but then they move on without taking responsibility for going there and using it. (And in real life, women do get beat up a lot without also getting raped.) 

Second, this might be just me, but if you think about other sorts of physical violence, you see the wounds. When someone is tortured or shot, you see blood, they have a wound, it is visible. Rape scenes rarely show blood coming out of the vagina and anus, because they were literally torn apart...and no physical effects last. They usually get over it. That bothers everyone, when a character gets physically wounded and their body just keeps going like it didn't happen. One of my big pet peeves. 

You wound a character in the ONE place you can't show unless you want to get an X rating. It does not get to be grouped with gore. With scenes of blood and guts, a woman being raped does not fit. Internal damage vs. Outer damage. That's because we don't think of rape as getting shot or getting your head cut off. Other physical violence is located at the wound on the physical body. The character will scream and cry, but the focus goes on where they were hurt on their body. Rape scene doesn't jump to the parts getting damaged, but instead on the emotional torture, screaming, etc. 
Also, a gunshot is fast. Chopping the head off is super fast. Elongated torture scenes are the closest comparison and it makes sense if someone is more affected by a torture scene than other violence. I am! 

If it's all the same, then why aren't men also raped? Men are raped by other men in real life, that's realistic. Often to torture. (Most old torture ended in getting stabbed up the ass, into the organs.) Except they aren't.......hmm...."

The more legs it has, the more crawly, that's why I hate centipedes more than spiders. I don't know how to get over this. 

It's always weird to me when others say ""oh, spiders aren't actually venomous and their bites don't hurt!"" What, I don't care what they do once they've touched me, once they touch me I've already lost. (But then again, I don't live around dangerous spiders anyways, so it's never been a fear.) I don't think anyone is scared of centipedes poisoning them, but I'm still traumatized from having one drop on my bare stomach in bed and I've never met anyone who likes centipedes. Honestly, if a spider bites me then at least I know where it is! (I've never consciously experienced a spider bite, just trying to explain my fear.)

I hate spiderwebs touching me too of course, but it's more that once a web is attached to me then a spider might be attached to me and oh god where is it is it crawling in my hair I can't shake it off I want to die I can't escape please kill me. 

How do you guys deal with spiders touching you in uncontrollable ways? I hate them touching me so much I avoid killing them too, because that's how much I don't want them touching me! So it kinda works out. I always choose running, I just can't run from my bed. The smart ones stay in the far corners of other rooms where I can just pretend I don't see them and they aren't there. This is also why I don't mind pictures of spiders, although they are usually so close up that they look like a different animal altogether.

""What about your abuser!!"" is a childish defense that only stops the argument as you are now forced to change the subject completely and tada, he won because you are no longer discussing his parents. It's real convenient for him that you have trauma in your past so he has something to weaponize! I have faith that if you didn't have that trauma, he would have just found something else to use. It's not because it's a good argument and it's definitely not because it's appropriate. It's available, not valid. 

I genuinely encourage you to look into whataboutism, read the definition so you feel comfortable using it against him, and then call his ass out on it! Call him out for trying to change the subject. Don't take the bait, stay calm and firm. Don't let his confidence trick you into accepting he made a good point. Whether or not it's a good argument is separate from his feelings and what he thinks he deserves (which is you just blindly accepting every stupid thing that leaves his mouth). If he has a point, it must stand on its own outside of his trauma - because that's where YOU are! 

**""We aren't talking about my sexual abuser right now, we are talking about your parents. Please stay on topic.""** Repeat this.

*Why can't we have one conversation about your parents? What is stopping us from just talking about your parents? We are talking about your past right now, not mine.*

Another big one: **""My sexual abuser is no longer in our lives. We are not in contact with him. That's why it doesn't apply.""**

This is not an unavoidable side effect of trauma, terrible arguments and bullshit tactics. It's a side effect of refusal to actually engage in an actual discussion between two people. You do you. Cut contact. He needs to justify why you should do things, you don't need to defend why you are NOT doing things. I think you've been screwed with enough, it's your turn to put your foot down and say NO. You're done just going along and letting them hurt you for no good reason.

I need to focus on my recovery and making myself happy, not making another person happy. It would take a lot of effort for him to make himself happy on top of getting better to make OP happy, and he can't even muster that. I definitely can't judge OP for leaving because I agree she should. I also can't judge the guy for being depressed, for not wanting to change that and for just not having the necessary energy and effort, whatever are the full details. I feel it. 

What I CAN judge him for, however, is for selfishly holding onto OP and expecting her to do all the effort for both of them. Relationships, marriages, are emotional labor. Already emotional labor often falls more on the woman's side. He's taking that already unfair unbalance too far. I don't think he ought to be in a relationship like this. 

So he cannot perform emotional labor. I get it because I seriously can't either. That's why I am currently emotionally unemployed! (Well, now I'm totally unemployed lol.) That's why I pay money for the emotional labor I do have provided (my therapist). I know it's more complicated than this, because he did start this job when he maybe had more health and now it's in too deep...my main point is that it's not selfish of OP to leave and it's actively selfish to expect her to stay and let him drain her dry."
