ESH - Your roommate’s boyfriend is an immature creep. Your roommate is a big time asshole. I do feel like you could’ve handled this better.

An assertive but polite response would’ve been a better choice.

No one likes to be told what to do or have to analyze the relationship all the time. In the first few months, everyone should just be feeling out the relationship and seeing if you’re compatible. You can’t be telling him all of your fears and worries (esp if you know you worry too much) right away and constantly pointing out the negatives. Yea, you can and should talk about it a little bit, but it sounds like you quickly wore him out with it. Also, if that’s not ok with you the he uses drugs occasionally, then maybe you should be considering whether you want to be with him. He’s an adult and if that’s something he does and it’s a deal breaker, then rather than controlling him, you should be making moves away from him.  Stop trying to control what you can’t control. Sounds like you need to let this one go and be a little calmer on your next try."

relationshipanxiety,fqfimfh,t3_ghyynv,1589325561.0,"You’re not alone. It’s so hard to tell right now what is anxiety and what is a valid worry. A couple of thoughts that may help:

1. Deal with today’s problems with today’s strength. Don’t try to deal with tomorrow’s problems and Friday’s problems and predicted problems 5 years from now with today’s strength. Only today’s problems. (My mantra: “Today’s problems. Today’s strength.”)

2. Start categorizing your thoughts as “productive” and “unproductive”. Is it productive to think “in 5 years she might not be the one”? No. Is it productive to think “maybe we should slow down, this is moving too fast”? Yes. Let the unproductive thoughts go as much as you can and focus on the productive ones.

3. Try not to make any big decisions right now. We’re all a little out of sorts and this isn’t the time to be jumping head first into or out of a relationship. Take it slow.

These things helped me. I hope they’ll help you too!"

Try to see if you can get just a tiny bit more calm each day using those. Something that really helped me was to stop catastrophizing everything and “future casting” (my therapists word). I saw a quote that said “Meet today’s problems with today’s strength.” As in... you can’t attack tomorrow’s problems yet. You don’t have tomorrow’s strength yet, but you WILL and you’ll meet those problems just fine. My mantra has become “today’s problems, today’s strength.” It helps."

It’s so painful to bring it all to the surface but then as you truly deal with one thing at a time, it’ll get better. My therapist told me the other day that the thoughts won’t stop coming but eventually they’ll be like an old familiar ghost. It’ll pop up and instead of being scared you’ll think “Oh I know you. You aren’t real.” and you’ll be ok.
