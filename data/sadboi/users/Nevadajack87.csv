The players found a small camp for the cultists on a nearby island. The cultists dive down to the wreck to check on their charges using potions of water breathing. 

I let the players rent an apparatus of Kwalish and had an encounter where they thought Zellifarn was a green dragon. He was just covered in algae. He carries the apparatus to the surface then questions them to see if they are cultists then asks them to help him. 

Inside the ship the door to the hold was trapped with a glyph of warding that fired an acid arrow. 

Parts of the hold were difficult terrain, other parts could provide partial cover. The encounter consisted of two green wyrmlings, two cultists and a priest as the main cultist. The priest can target two targets with sanctuary and uses it to protect the Wyrmlings."
