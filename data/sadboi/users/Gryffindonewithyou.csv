books,fnlxjhz,t3_g2j1od,1587061471.0,"Hi there!

First of all: Thank you for putting such amazing stories out into the world - you are my all time favorite author - and I honestly have trouble getting my head around the fact that you might be reading my words right now anD OH MY GOSH YOU’RE ACTUALLY READING THIS!

I am such a huge fan of your works; Arc of a Scythe will forever be my favorite series - I plan on introducing the books to my own students someday! (I’m a High School teaching student)

I have a few questions:

Do you plan on writing a Scythe spin off? Honestly, I just can’t get enough of this universe!

How long does it normally take you to write a book like «Scythe»? I’m guessing you’ve had the idea for a while, seeing as the whole universe seems so well thought out!

What is your favorite book or book series? 

Which book series do you think would do best in a project for 15 & 16-year-olds, Unwind or Arc of a Scythe? 

Have you always wanted to be a writer? If not, what was your dream before becoming such a successful one? 

And now for a more personal auestion; I would love to get a signed copy of Arc of a Scythe - that would literally make me ecstatic! Is there a way I could pay for that and get it sent to me? It would be my most prized possesion and make an excellent addition to my library <3

Lots of love, and again thank you for writing such immersive stories!

I also have my own etsy shop, although I haven’t opened it yet.. hehe, I guess I’m too scared to do so.
