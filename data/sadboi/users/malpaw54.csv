Beastars,fmafbf4,t1_fmaev0w,1585892278.0,"I’ve done MMA..

Size matters. Size matters a lot.

With a lot of skill and stamina a small fighter could defeat a larger opponent. But should both be on the same level or the smaller fighter even be not much better of a fighter they are going to lose.

I fought someone who was 5’4 and like MAYBE a buck 50. He was a really skilled fighter and also more in shape, all it took was one mistake on his part for me to catch him and it was over. If he hadn’t fucked up and let me catch him then he could have won but all it took was me catching him and taking it to the ground. All but the VERY best fighter can beat someone bigger than them as you not only have to be in shape, but also know a variety of moves, know how to use their weight against them, and be faster.


Skill is extremely important but there’s a reason, a very important reason why there are weight classes in every form of martial arts."

Naw whoever is writing it just knows nothing about animals.

Hippos are extremely territorial and will kill anything in their water.. but are herbivores.

Although.. almost all herbivores will be opportunistic and eat meat on occasion. You can videos of horses eating chicks and kittens, deer eating squirrels, chicks, and eggs, rabbits eating insects, tortoises eating carrion and (attempting) to hunt small animals. If they are missing protein or nutrients in their diet they will hunt or scavenge.. for example iguana iguana (green iguana) almost never hunts or eats animal protein in it’s natural environment but in Florida where it is invasive it well known to eat chicks, eggs, invertebrates, and small animals. Although it’s not good for their kidneys intestines and or livers if they have too much. 

Beastars attempts to write herbivores as small innocent and weak.. herbivores are anything but, some of the most dangerous animals on the planet are herbivores or omnivores."
Beastars,fmad7hl,t1_fmacrlq,1585890399.0,"Rats are extremely opportunistic.

I’ve had some as pets.

When I was younger I made the mistake of putting a mouse with my rats because I didn’t have another cage.

Woke up to just a bloody mess, they had eaten everything but the thickest bones and even those had been gnawed on.

Although rats typically prefer carrion, and invertebrates. They rarely hunt, unless they are in a large colony in which it can trigger an urge to hunt smaller animals, other rats, and whatever else they can kill."

I just remember as a kid wanting lots of pets, and my parents would only let me have 1 dog and 1 hamster.

So instead I bought animal books and read all about all the animals of the world and would imagine what it would be like to befriend/ own it. That followed me into adulthood and I just never stopped wanting to learn about all the other life we share this planet with. 

I like Bojack, but I agree I don’t particularly understand the need for the characters to be animals, I was annoyed by Princess Caroline’s adopted daughter having quills because it didn’t actually serve any story element other than to be funny the very first time, and then be annoying or dumb after that."

lions and tigers both definitely sheathe their claws. All felines have retractable claws, it’s a huge part of what makes a cat a cat.

They don’t do a good job with some of the species, I couldn’t tell what Miguno was, I assumed he was supposed to be a golden jackal because he dorms with canidae when he’s not even a caniformia, hyenas are feliformia.

Whether she plans on killing you is not a part of the question, it’s whether or not the average person (aka a jury) would agree that self defense was logical.

And since some states have the stand your ground law having the ability to retreat is not even a question.

If she hits you, does not stop or attempt to leave, and you have a stand your ground law, you have a right to self defense and retreating doesn’t have to be considered (and it shouldn’t have to because if you don’t want to start a fight you don’t start hitting someone)

Example of no right to self defense:

If she hits you once, the jury would not agree that hitting her back with the force to do damage was not agreeable and you’d be facing charges for assault.

Right to self defense:

She hits you repeatedly, causing bruises or other damage, you have the the full legal right to defend yourself with enough force to make her stop (killing her would not be justified but punching her with enough force to break her arm, would)

Right to kill:

She is hitting you, shouting that she plans on killing you, and you have taken enough damage that you and a jury would believe your life to be in true and present danger, you’d 100% be in the right to throat punch her or bash her skull.
