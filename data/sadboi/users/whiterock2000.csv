ptsd,f0vap53,t3_d6nj9p,1568973545.0,"This was me pretty much. I’m now 23 but up till recently I continued going through traumatizing experiences. I eventually came to realize that my dad babying me and treating me like a girl all my life has had a negative effect on me all these years. To this day though I still don’t have any guy friends because of years of mistreatment as a kid. 

On an unrelated note - I LOVE that twilight zone episode!!!"
relationship_advice,exs88h4,t3_cu8xwg,1566535456.0,"Many people manage but obviously it’s all assumptions until you actually get a girlfriend and communicate with each other and set up boundaries, maintaining study and social habits, etc. I think I know what you’re getting at tho, many ppl would rather not be tied down to a relationship in college and do fwb type things. It’s up to you on if you want commitment or not."
relationship_advice,exfpijm,t3_csmlux,1566245638.0,"No, you’re not. You’re obviously happier with new girl. Don’t string people along. Break up with your current gf and start something with new girl. You’ve got absolutely nothing to lose."
relationship_advice,exfmvnc,t3_csm7sq,1566244026.0,"Do you have any actual evidence to back that up? I know how you feel but unless there’s a reason to feel that way, then I wouldn’t assume."
relationship_advice,ewryyd9,t3_cpw6qe,1565716753.0,"Maybe cut out a lot of those (xxy) bits, it makes it choppier to read. Other than that, this doesn’t really sound like a love story to me, more like a crush story. Since you don’t know if she reciprocates or not. But if you think something could eventually happen, then go for it man"
relationship_advice,evswfy5,t3_cl53c4,1564757682.0,"No, it’s not fucked up beyond all reason. I personally don’t think age isn’t as big of an issue as most ppl make it out to be. I’m 22 and have been involved with people twice as old as me, for example. A bit of an extreme comparison but you feel me. I would go for it. If there are no issues, you both feel the same way, why not? One life to live! However, you two are in very different stages of life and from first hand experience, that can cause issues eventually. But it might not. Just enjoy it, don’t be afraid to live a little 😉"
relationship_advice,evrxnsc,t3_ckzh20,1564721855.0,"It’s natural for him to feel that way as he hasn’t had a lot of relationship experience and you’re both young. I would just explain to him in a kind gentle way that you know how insecure he is but that you would never cheat on him. I don’t think you have to be as careful as you think you do, he loves you and honestly you bringing this up might be a relief to him as it’s all out in the open, the pressure is off of him. He might open up more."
relationship_advice,ett32mf,t1_ett2v0s,1563162992.0,"They mean like explain more when she says I love you. Do you mean like every day, she failed to do so today, something like that? 

And honestly y’all haven’t been together too long, high school relationships often don’t last. But I would try being more open with her and let her know why you’ve been less communicative recently, that might go a long way."
relationship_advice,etrv1f7,t3_cd6apl,1563129707.0,"Work on not being afraid. Take some time to yourself. Ask yourself why you were cheated on. Tell yourself it won’t happen again. Practice positive thoughts, build yourself up. Surround yourself with at least one caring supportive friend. Ik how you feel, I’ve lived it."
relationship_advice,etrudpo,t3_cd6eju,1563129310.0,Well it seems like you have some outside pressure to drop him. I would just politely explain to your ex that you’re in a committed relationship now and maybe can catch up again some time.
relationship_advice,etrsile,t3_cd62i3,1563128166.0,Most of the time tho the accusations have merit. It’s not looking great :/
relationship_advice,etrrhsv,t3_cd62i3,1563127535.0,Just go with it man. Honestly keep your expectations low with this one.

relationship_advice,eqtsdve,t3_bzn88e,1560318449.0,"Just my personal belief but I don’t think so. I think, if you love this other woman, then you need to leave your wife. That’s only fair. 🤷‍♂️"
relationship_advice,eqred45,t3_bzc7me,1560258573.0,"So get over, look past, or cut him out? Hmm. I don’t believe in automatically believing someone necessarily with no evidence other than their word but sometimes you just have to go with your gut instinct. Don’t let outside influences like what your family might think have any bearing on your decision.  It’s how you feel. If you don’t feel comfortable talking with him anymore, then don’t."
relationship_advice,eqpf4j8,t3_bz2x62,1560198992.0,"I mean based on what you’ve said I say go for it. But. Do you know where she is in life? If she’s in a relationship, etc.? Another option might be to establish communication again but just as friends and after a period of time see if you both want to take it back to where it was before."
relationship_advice,eqhdyvv,t3_bygmlz,1560055978.0,"Give him space, first off. If it’s too painful for you then go no contact or very little, even thought at first it will hurt like hell. 

It has just been two weeks, too. In the moment it’s hard to tell what’s love or not, and it’s easy to get caught up in the rush of things. Lots of butterflies. There’s no telling what he feels, and he needs time to figure things out. Regarding his ex, you, if he wants to try casual dating or fwb or just focus on himself. Hopefully he’ll take it."
relationship_advice,eqb1oyv,t3_by071b,1559943630.0,"Yes that’s def the smoother approach, and it’ll come across as genuine (as long as you actually have something to say about it)"
relationship_advice,eqb1gyt,t3_by064r,1559943537.0,I mean you’ve done everything you can do. Some people you just can’t reach.
relationship_advice,eq7n0a6,t3_bxkv11,1559849716.0,"It sounds to me like a lot of the trust issues he has to work out for himself. You both seem to have insecurities about the other, and honestly the best you can do is just continue to be open with one another and transparent. Communication is always key in a healthy relationship."
relationship_advice,epvo837,t3_bw7cm4,1559542095.0,"You put a question mark after girlfriend. If you don’t even know if you’re together or not then you’re on pretty shaky ground.

You basically made it sound like y’all had broken up or at least taken a break. So it’s her business what she does in that time. 🤷‍♂️"

relationship_advice,epbxsfs,t3_bugp01,1559148046.0,"No. I’m a guy but in the past I used to think the same as you that any relationship I was in I’d be cheated on bc I’m low key ugly, or st least I used to think so. I don’t have actual examples to prove otherwise so far but i no longer tell myself such pessimistic self defeating self talk. And obviously all people aren’t like me, but physical appearance or “traditional beauty” doesn’t really matter to me. Like nobody I’ve been intimately involved with has been traditionally beautiful objectively speaking, but I still thought they were beautiful. I’m 5’7 and very small, a guy, and half of the women I’ve been involved with have been physically much larger than me, taller too. And it’s not like I was seeking that, it just turned out that way. I will tell you, what I look for in someone is personality, uniqueness, what common interests we share. Physical appearance is very low on the scale. I’ll be honest, you are NOT ugly. And once you start believing in yourself more, you’ll be surprised."

relationship_advice,ep39a4g,t3_btvu4d,1559019714.0,"Yeah not sure why he’s making such a fuss but he’s clearly uneducated about pole dancing. He’s probably like most people, when they think of pole dancers they think of strip clubs, movies, heck even jerry springer. But he can educate himself instead of rushing to unfounded judgments 🤷‍♂️"
relationship_advice,eor82kw,t3_bswi3n,1558802489.0,"I think your friend is exactly right. This is not the situation to have your cake and eat it too. Tell work guy that you are taken and stop flirting with him. And if in the long run you decide you like work guy more, then break up with native guy."
r4r,eonfzfv,t3_bscart,1558711574.0,You actually look almost exactly like someone that works at my local Chick-fil-A. 😛
relationship_advice,eojzo91,t3_bs86a3,1558645101.0,"No, it’s not worth it. She does not sound interested. Break up with her. 

I have a friend that has basically followed that same script. I’m calling her today to basically ask if she still wants to be friends. 🤷‍♂️"
