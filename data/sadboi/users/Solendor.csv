The armored train extract is timed, I cannot remember the timing but the whistles indicate how soon it's leaving. 

Hermetic bunker is a bit trickier - between white pawn and white king is a small building. Inside is a switch to start the extract - which spawns raiders, but will allow you to exit via the door.
