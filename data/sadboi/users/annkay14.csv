Catholicism,fpt2qy6,t1_fp8ssoq,1588883849.0,"I have nothing to contribute towards OP’s question. But I just wanted to say I really appreciate your gentle and non-combative/non-defensive approach. I’ve come across some people in this subreddit who are genuinely curious about the Church’s teaching only to be met with curt or unhelpful defensive comments. The most SMH-worthy I’ve seen? ‘How should I know? ask a priest!’ Yeah not helpful and could have been said differently. So in short, thank you for displaying common decency and willingness to teach!"
Catholicism,fphjepe,t1_fp514b8,1588622326.0,Amen! And thanks for the reminder of Mathew Chapter 5 and 6- will be reading this right after work.

Your upbringing sounds like it was really rough on you and I’m sorry you had to deal with all of that. But congrats on quitting to drugs and getting back into school- those are great accomplishments that shouldn’t be overlooked! Just wishing you all the best and hope you are having better days"
EOOD,f97ruxf,t3_e3vcrc,1575169482.0,I went to a pottery making class with a girl I met on bumble BFF (app where you can make friends) and had Margherita pizza afterwards. Was a chill and fun night! Also met up with another girl from Bumble BFF  for the first time and it was not as terrifying as I make it seem like sometimes haha making progress one potential friendship at a time

adhdwomen,f55sfxe,t3_buqo3z,1572012957.0,"I know I’m pretty late to this group! But I related to so much of what you’ve said. It’s so hard making friends, never had much luck growing up and always found myself so different from others. Btw I’m 27 from Canada and if you’re still wanting to connect, I’d be willing!"
adhdwomen,f4c8ulx,t3_ddf5bz,1571525961.0,Are we like the same person?! This is me to a T. I find that I have to visualize the words that I’m about to say before I say something because I can’t just speak normally without stopping mid sentence because I forget words or have trouble forming a coherent sentence and forming a concrete thought. Coming up with something to say or reply is so hard for me to do so I end up letting the other person speak to no end. I’ve found that people will speak over me because I sound like I’m talking nonsense and it makes me not want to speak so much. So much of my life I felt like I didn’t know how to speak and connect. I’m sorry you’re going through this but selfishly feel glad that I’m not the only one. Sending you supportive vibes your way!
