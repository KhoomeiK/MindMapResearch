redstone,fm2ainb,t1_fm277aj,1585693640.0,I linked a video above that discusses how I derived the solution. Basically I determined the acceleration of items and then the blast radius items are destroyed. And using that am able to determine the max theoretical amount of blocks you can get from a tnt blast chamber. I assume ilmangos design for a tnt blast chamber which he says can get the most from a tnt blast. This is a mathematical model it should be noted and not a practical model.

schizophrenia,flq1k84,t1_flpz2uo,1585375627.0,"When Im a lizard I dont remember being human and think I am a lizard. I think I turn into an asian water monitor. I can remember what its like when Im a lizard and I really like being a lizard and often wish I could just stay as a lizard. Though my tongue, back legs, and tail dont work quite right.

Losing the human knowledge and awareness doesnt really feel like much. It just kinda disappears. I dont really know how to describe it. I dont have much memory anyway which probably affects this but having or not having that knowledge doesnt feel any different its like never having the knowledge in the first place. Sometimes I have a bit if time warning before turning into a lizard as I can feel my arms and legs start to turn scaly and lizardy crawling up my neck. It used to freak me out but I like being a lizard and wish I could stay that way. Often on my arms I will have little spots that have scales on them like the area is constantly growing and shrinking and slowly turning into scales.

I can remember some bits that happen while Im a lizard. At least about as well as other things. When I was at the residential hospital one of the girls I was friends with would basically act like a handler to me. I normally dont remember actually turning into a lizard just being a lizard for a bit. I do like being a lizard. It feels very natural and comfortable and Im supposed to be a lizard. Things are simple and normally Im safe. It can be a struggle to take my meds because they make me not be a lizard but I want to be a lizard. It does also leave me scared to go in big public places or places I might freak out and turn into a lizard (even though Ive not turned into a lizard because of anxiety stuffs so Im not sire where I got that fear from) in case they send me to a hospital (and for a while I was scared if they would have animal control capture me or kill me)."
