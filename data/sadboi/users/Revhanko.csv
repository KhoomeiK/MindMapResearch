SuicideWatch,eu67h9t,t3_c6fcnj,1563493866.0,"We as the human race have only one survival tool in this planet and that is organisation, and through organisation comes understanding which means that we as humans are designed to care for each other and supporting each other especially in times like these. One of my ambitions is to set up a business where you can either call or text a person who would just there to talk to you about how you feel. Now i know that there is suicide hotline facilities in many countries but like in this case, it must be handled in a proffessional manner as it deals with a person in a delicate state of mind where everything around him is falling apart and crumbling down when all he needs is a nice person to talk to.  
I really hope you have a great life ahead man and be happy and never forget to smile because you never know what the world has giftwrapped for you :)"
SuicideWatch,eu66nds,t3_c34ko8,1563493328.0,"I believe we could all learn a lesson here in order to prevent situations as such as the one faced by this gentleman. We could learn that more communication is key and put in as much as much truth out of our heads as possible.  For example if we feel a certain way about your partner, i request to immediately ensure that this is conveyed to them. If it might be a bitter message,  it might be initially hard for your partner to take it in but later on they will understand and appreciate your honesty. Now i am not stating that this gentleman had a lack of communication with his late ex girlfriend (rest in peace), but this is the case with most relationships, a sad truth indeed. 

I hope we can all learn to love each other and support each other through this wonderful community more and more and share the pain thats in our heart to this supportive community."
