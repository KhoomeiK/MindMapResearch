I also found therapy beneficial just for having someone in my life/support circle that isn‚Äôt connected directly to my life, that I can talk to openly and honestly about anything and everything. My family has been great but I wouldn‚Äôt fully open up to them for fear of putting too much worry and stress on them."

The constant battle I have found is that CBT has me questioning a lot of different things I do in life, in a positive way. My therapist explained it as part of the brain retraining itself to think in new ways."

I hit my wall a few years back as Exe Chef of a hotel, great money but worked 60+ hours per week, constantly getting called and texts on rare off days. General Manager kept pushing for more profits, tighter costs, low labour, finally led to my breaking point. Took time to figure out what I want and how to get it in life. I‚Äôm lucky that moving up the ranks I got extensive management training that I‚Äôve been able to translate into a career outside of hospitality that better suits my needs. Still not perfect, some evening and a few weekends required but overall a better balance.

I‚Äôm pretty honest when I talk to young cooks looking at this as a career it burns many people out eventually. Enjoy it while you can, learn all you can, travel if you‚Äôre able to but always think 5 years down the road about what you want in life."
