But I recommend reaching out to someone before you have to complete this project, otherwise, there's a chance that it will demotivate you even further. Don't mean to scare you but, these milestones are important in life, if you lose them you just stop being scared of the failure and tend to get more and more comfortable with the state of failure.

I have experienced a lot of failure myself. I never made an attempt to seek therapy or any help before my important exams or other crucial times. I lost all the motivation to get back on track. I am still trying to regain my lost motivation.

But you are worried about the graduation project, which is in a way, a good thing. Try n convert that anxiety into motivation. Start with the smallest steps towards building it. Establish a routine. But most importantly, I feel you should seek professional help."

I  agree with you when you said others can't fix you and you have to learn about the self care, but I cant speak for everyone whether they should or shouldn't expect people to be there when they need them for every person is different with different emotional needs. Also, the people am saying are expected to be around could have sometimes or even often come to the now diseased person in their need of hour.. So, at least out of courtesy... Plus they also claim to be the close ones.

And lastly if checking or responding to that one msg could save somebody's life, then you wouldn't consider it over the fact that it may bring you down?

Also, Guys, I may have blurted out that comment because of something that I have been through personally that really made me feel unwanted and clingy and lonely at that time..

And while I don't idealize or glorify being suicidal I also want to stress the fact that people don't resort to it by choice or while being completely in control of their emotions.. it mostly happens when they are helpless.

And finally to answer your question, I am just saying that if you are aware that you have a person in your life who is going through tough times and could be potentially suicidal and you could be one of the few they will try reaching out to and you miss their indication, at least try to be empathetic and more concerned.
