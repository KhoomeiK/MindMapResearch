I’m experiencing something kinda similar. I grew up a dedicated catholic due to my grandma, and now I’m not. She doesn’t know that. She doesn’t force religion onto me or anything, more like a slight tug I pretend to follow. What people don’t understand is we’ve grown up in different times, and have different principles. People are divided into generations for a reason. I do believe if I told her, she’d be okay(ish) with it. Maybe a little disappointed, maybe a little scared, but okay. She’ll love me either way, but honestly I don’t have any intent on telling her. Like you said, it’s easier to lie. It gives me peace of mind to know she’s at peace of mind.
So anyways, although you’re lying, I can tell you have no ill intentions."
