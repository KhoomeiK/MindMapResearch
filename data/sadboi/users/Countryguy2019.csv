Whats worse depends on the individual, a normally happy person can loose a child and be suicidal  and can potentially die. Another person like you say with depression and self harm thoughts can live with the feeling constantly, minute by minute, so all are as intense as each other. Each requires a different method for therapy. Not 100% sure what you mean about the brain and the prioritizing ?? But i can say the preoccupation with thinking about dying is so intense all options are considered and looked at. So to get past this is firstly a major distraction but in a way that requires total engagement, but then this also needs to be sustainable and have an immense level of understanding and empathy. Medications can help but in soms case are not a solution either."
