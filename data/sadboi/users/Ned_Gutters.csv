askphilosophy,fq5uxla,t3_ggxgws,1589118099.0,"Levinas embraces something like this. On his reading, phenomenology and philosophy in general show that meaning is a matter of the way in which something is given for a particular person, and the relationships it has to one’s own experiences. That is, we impose our own concepts and categories onto the world, and those are inseparable from our own perspective. What something is is what it is for me. However, he thinks language and the “experience” of another person disrupts this. The other person appears precisely at that which I can’t perceive - as something beyond myself, beyond familiar categories, beyond the way in which I understand their expressions in terms of the familiar. When the other speaks to us, our attention is drawn to what is for the other, not what is for me. In other words, in communication, our we are being for the other, subject to their terms rather than our own. In order to make sense of what is being said, we indeed shift back into what is familiar to us, but there is an ethical difference: we apply our concepts to make sense of something fundamentally distinct from us. Insofar as our concepts are inherently tied to ourselves, they will always be inadequate in this regard, but the other is the source of meaning beneath these concepts: they tell us when we “get it right” or not, even if we never get it exactly right. The point is not that what we say or agree on cannot be literally true, but rather that the possibility of attaining truth depends on the expression of the other, who directs me outside myself if an ethical sense, even if I inevitably fall back on myself. We can’t get it right in isolation, taking language to be words or signifiers locked in my head, but can get in right in communication, taking language to be a way that the other directs my attention and forces me to interpret and justify myself."
DungeonsAndDragons,fq3ypcg,t1_fq2bgd0,1589071799.0,"I always hated that rule, because it doesn't scale. Let's say you're a barbarian with d12 hp, expected value 6.5 per level, call it 7, and let's say you have a +3 con. At level 5, 50 is all your hit points. At level 10, it's half; 15, one third. 20, one quarter. Not only can you instantly die to a smaller and smaller percentage of your health (while you're supposed to be getting more powerful), but dealing that damage to you gets easier and easier for your enemies to accomplish. I always house ruled it out for that reason.

They refused to leave when asked, and told staff to call the police, who then physically removed this person. The whole situation was on video, there is text evidence of sustained, targeted violence on the part of the person in question against employees of Avenue, and there were many witnesses. They then went to an excellent organization in town, that has earned its respect, and misrepresented the situation to them. First, they claimed it was because of race (as an aside, one of the victims was a person of color). When that didn’t stick, they went with the trans story. Without fact-checking, a crusade began on social media. Members of the LGBTQ+ community at large, as well as present and past LGBTQ+ members of the team (including the owner/founder), came out in support of Avenue, facts were checked, Avenue and the organization in question corresponded productively (they were apparently looking forward to supporting each other in the future), and all attacks on social media by the organization were removed.

Pathfinder does this pretty well. They state that the setting is the age of lost omens, what that means - both in a technical sense as well as for people all around the world - and a very cursory mention of the well-known, major events that began the age.

nextfuckinglevel,fkal2kt,t1_fkablu9,1584012166.0,We terrible mess up our coding all the time. Weak AI with benevolent code could still be catastrophic if it has enough control over information.
CoronavirusUK,fkafgw7,t1_fkafblm,1584005649.0,Thanks! You too!
DMAcademy,fkaf8qt,t1_fkaep5t,1584005345.0,"I agree. I am familiar with the core of 2nd, and it is really not that complicated. 5e, I think, is less complex than its immediate predecessors, but far more complex than 2nd. What makes 5e less complex is capping of stats at 20, limited number of feats, feats as an alternative to stats, disadvantage/advantage rather than modifier on top of modifier on top of modifier, and generally less interaction between feats than in 3, 3.5, and 4. But nevertheless, it definitely still counts as “rules heavy.” Another way to put it is that it has a ton of features, but not a lot of interacting between or stacking of features. Something like core 2e would be more suitable for this audience, I think."

askphilosophy,fkae9pm,t1_fk9xsn1,1584004026.0,"I think these comments are onto something. I would also add that he refers to resentiment as “indigestion” and chastises readers for not being able to digest anything; not being able to ruminate. That is, the reactive person who lacks power to discharge his urges in the world turns that discharge inward, holding onto the least slights, anxieties, and so on; he becomes incapable of forgetting, and thus incapable of happiness. That is, he suffers from a kind of indigestion, where what he takes in never passes through him, but instead becomes a lingering source of misery and self-righteousness."
DMAcademy,fkae2ms,t1_fk9gpm4,1584003764.0,"Strange, I think the definitive strength of 5e is how accessible it is for people who have never played. It is far and away an improvement on 4th, but 4, 3.5, and 3 were all far more complex and deep. I think some colleges might offer an associate’s degree in 3.5, which requires 2 semester of lab work. (I don’t know too much about 4, though, so I may be wrong; I’ve only played it twice and never ran it.)  
  
That’s not the say your other recommendations aren’t more simple; I really know nothing about them. I’m just used to comparing 5 to other editions of DnD and, on that playing field, it is by far the most simple. Your suggestions might be even better for a simple, accessible rule set. I assume you’re right in your assessment."

CoronavirusUK,fk8nizu,t3_fh3bfk,1583959410.0,"I've never seen bench gains as much as when I took a month and a half to do bodyweight workouts, including pseudo planche pushups. Went back and what I used to lift was easy, and my next time back I shattered plateaus. Bodyweight exercises work a lot of stabilizer muscles and muscle coordination that carries over pretty well to lifting if you take bodyweight seriously. Time for me to get some more mileage out of my pull up bar, olympic rings, and the floor.  
  
I recommend r/bodyweightfitness . Their recommended routine can get us through this."
