With the 1st book I already have my beginning, middle, and end. So I've just been working on filling in everything else in between. I pretty much split it into 3 Acts which aren't official separations in the actual book, that's just how I split it up in my head to get the right ebb and flow. 

What I am doing though is dividing it up into 10 chapters (sort of following the 10 hr ""movie"" format that channels like HBO or Netflix have for most of their dramas/shows). Since its going to be a graphic novel I'm thinking of making each chapter an ""issue"" and writing them out piecemeal. It's been working for me so far and also takes alot of the pressure off finishing a rough draft of the entire book for some friends to read.

writing,fir4w47,t3_f9d674,1582657423.0,"If your story is any genre other than smut, the focus should be less on the end result (the sex scene) and more on the journey that brought your characters to that type of conclusion. The idea that less is more. Spending too much time describing the exact physicality of it imho takes away from the emotional investment of the moment. Also, because some things are best left to one's imagination. No matter how well you write/describe the sex those two characters are having, what will make the difference is the emotional aspect of the intimacy and circumstances that naturally built up to it. 

For example, I'm writing a sci-fi thriller set in a dystopian society. Two of my protagonists are each other's ex and while the relationship ended they remain friendly. Over the course of the story both characters endure a lot of personal trauma both physically and mentally in their own respective character arcs, and after a long hiatus finally cross paths again. When they do, they're both overwhelmed with many different feelings and find themselves speechless. After several seconds of looking at each other and seeing both from the bruises on their bodies as well as the look in their eyes, they both start crying and immediately start holding one another for support and comfort. At that point it's really about describing closeness, how one nuzzles his face into the other's shoulder, and the other takes his right hand and wraps it around the back of the other's head to ruffle his hair, etc. The scene pretty much ends with them embracing and crying softly on each other's shoulders. Intimacy in general when you're describing it should be the focus rather than describing say what their genitals look like or what sex position they used.

You don't necessarily need to look to other examples of sci-fi for inspiration either. The Red Wedding from GOT inspired me to create a scenario/major twist with as much weight and consequence, but obviously one that fits the context of my story and is relevant to the conflict (and no it's not a wedding).

Feminists are not all accountable for the reasons that led to Silverman committing suicide, and isn't addressing the real issue. Like women, men can be victims of domestic abuse.

askgaybros,ff6agn4,t1_ff68z5e,1579622897.0,"> It's part of the societal shift toward denigration of masculinity. 

No. The societal shift we're seeing isn't attempting to denigrate or discourage masculinity. It's attempting to curb habits of *toxic* masculinity. Which refers to certain cultural norms that are harmful to society. 

The problem is, too many people assume that the argument being made is that simply being masculine is inherently toxic. Which is absolutely not the case. 

Common examples of masculinity (which are completely fine):

* Devotion to work.
* Excelling in sports. 
* Providing for one's family. 

Examples of what *toxic* masculinity is:

* The belief that men are socially dominant, and having traits of misogyny (also quite often homophobic tendencies as well). 
* Promoting and normalizing violence, including sexual assault and domestic abuse.

Me personally, I'm a masculine acting gay guy who's attracted to other masculine guys. There's nothing wrong with that, just as much as there's nothing wrong with two feminine gay men dating one another. Or a masculine gay guy and a feminine gay guy dating. Diversity in gender roles isn't exclusive to the gay community, it's something all of us get to enjoy. And even if you think there's one person out there attempting to denigrate masculinity, the overwhelming majority of people (gay or straight, feminist or not) do not realistically agree with the notion that masculinity has to be abolished. 

> Feminists want more ladies and fewer gay men (by definition mgtow)

Wrong again. The definition of feminism is quite literally ""the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes."" *On the basis of the equality of the sexes*. 

Again, I'm not disputing there aren't a fringe minority of feminists out there who are anti-men. Just in the same way there's a fringe group of men who are anti-feminist, and your MGTOW reference is bonafide proof of that. I've never even heard of ""mgtow"" until you mentioned it, and can guarantee all but maybe 1 of the people I know personally have too. Experience bias isn't enough data to make a determination but safe to say both MGTOW as well as the feminist equivalent of it, are in the razor thin fringe minority of people and not representative of the overwhelming majority of people. The majority, like myself, consist of people who literally do not care how others choose to identify their gender or live their lives."

No, that's obviously not the case. The literal definition may say between a ""man and woman"", but who is that hurting? Absolutely no one.

But it's definitely something I want to change rather than being someone who only makes time to read on vacation. 

That being said, it's sort of worked out for me anyway. I know deep down no matter how much I read that I'll never be able to write prose as well as many other writers out there, and I've accepted it. Because of that it gave me the idea to go in a different direction. I thought instead of a traditional novel, what about eventually making my story into a graphic novel. For a few reasons: 

* There's plenty of great Graphic novels out there that are seriously underrated imho. Alan Moore being probably my favorite writer, particularly Watchmen and V for Vendetta. 
* Like books, graphic novels can create whatever your imagination and creative genius comes up with. But you get the visual aspect of it which has always been pretty appealing to me. 
* Rather than focusing on descriptions of everything to lay the groundwork for a scene, the artwork/panels do that for you. So I can spend more time working on the characters, dialogue, and the overall plot. 

I'm admittedly not really an artist and am looking for someone to collaborate with (they do the art, I write the story). But this path's given me a huge relief and helped me finally write the story I wanted to tell. 

TL;DR if you want to be a better writer, I agree that reading is incredibly important. But also recognize that not every writer is meant to write prose. It can manifest itself in different mediums, and it's only a failure if you personally feel like you haven't fulfilled your potential."

This was in the mid 2000s before coming out had become ""popular"" because I didn't know anyone else in my class let alone the school who was out and gay themselves, and you hardly saw any representation on TV or mention of it in the media. At the time it felt incredibly lonely and as a result growing up I always sought out information online, watched gay porn (which was also my own sex education), and talked to guys over AIM that I knew were older than me and otherwise wouldn't have been appropriate in real life. 

I'm sure its easier in a number of schools today since some gay teens now seem to openly date other guys in school, ask them to prom etc. But I guarantee tons of gay teens still have an experience similar to this, being closeted and only having the internet (and porn) as their only source of information and contact with anyone else who's gay, whether or not any of it is appropriate. The silver lining I think is that it puts gay men in a situation where we're forced to be independent and look out for ourselves at a young age, but that only works if the person learns from their experience.
