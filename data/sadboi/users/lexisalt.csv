selfharm,erb8ge4,t1_erb8f71,1560666294.0,I know it’s hard to be positive a lot of the time and it’s easier said than done but even picking out a silver lining makes a world of difference
selfharm,erb8amg,t3_c16x1v,1560666078.0,"I’m so sorry you’re going through this :( be proud of yourself for the four years ! And it’s all about moving forwards now :) if you need /want someone to talk to, feel free to PM me :)"
selfharm,er7bglf,t3_c0qhbk,1560573576.0,They’ll fade for the most part. Mine are 5 years old and I went from having about 200+ visible ones to only about 50 that you can make out. The vast majority of them are flat white lines now. Just gotta give it time !
selfharm,er4gjtu,t3_c0f316,1560491061.0,Oh god you hit the nail on the head here. I usually just kind of tap the area with my fingers as if to just make it go away. Or I pace in my room.
StopSelfHarm,er3jqx0,t3_c0afye,1560464802.0,"Good job! Sounds cliche but physical activity has really helped me , also journaling if being active isn’t your thing :)"
StopSelfHarm,eqz4512,t3_c0077x,1560393592.0,"Please don’t. There are so many alternatives ! Taking a bath , working out , yoga, drawing , crossword puzzles. Find something that brings you joy and do that. I know it’s easier said than done but it’ll be so hard to quit again , trust me."
selfharm,eqyzazv,t3_bzzxpx,1560391641.0,"First of all , breathe. Take some nice deep breaths. Now , is there anything you do to calm you down? Drawing , drinking tea? If yes then do that. If not , something that really works and I heavily recommend is tiring yourself out. Even if you hate it , do push-ups until you physically can’t anymore and your arms give out. You’ll be exhausted and have a nice little endorphin boost too."
selfharm,eqyyahe,t3_bzzotx,1560391220.0,Don’t. Seriously don’t. It’s what everyone will tell you and it’s for a reason. Somebody dm’d me that exactly when I was 15 years old and I so wish I had taken the advice. I thought I knew better and that I could control it but I can’t and nobody can really
selfharm,eqyufmm,t3_bzystu,1560389563.0,I used to keep mine in the back of my journals (they had little pockets for random stuff).
selfharm,eqr4amw,t3_bzah6e,1560247428.0,"It depends how old you are , and the laws on where you are, but doctor patient confidentiality should apply unless you openly say you want/plan to kill yourself. (Please double check before). I really think you should tell your therapist so they can help you. It’s hard but it’s an important step to take. Good luck :)"
StopSelfHarm,eqr2psh,t3_byqqhx,1560244887.0,"Obviously I’m going to sound like everyone else here, but please, stop now. Seriously. While you can. I was given the same advice when I was 15 years old and I had been scratching myself with a kilt pin , and now my body is littered with a >100 scars. Don’t be like me. This shit can ruin your life just like any drug."
selfharm,eqqgd27,t3_bz6txf,1560220358.0,CONGRATS DUDE. The first month is always the roughest and you’re 66% of the way there !
selfharm,eqqg5ku,t3_bz6n45,1560220217.0,Do some pushups right now. Do them until your arms just can’t take it anymore. It’ll burn out your energy and give you the exercise endorphins. You’ve got this !
selfharm,eqqbnl0,t1_eqqblwl,1560217295.0,You’ll get through it! Take tomorrow as it comes and the day after that etc :)
selfharm,eqqbf02,t3_bz69er,1560217118.0,I’m so sorry this happened :( the good news is that you can move forwards. Don’t beat yourself up. Look at 12 years as an achievement. Now look forward to the next 12 years. One relapse isn’t going to change that. You’ve got this ❤️
selfharm,eqqayqi,t1_eqqateo,1560216786.0,"It’s so frustrating ! People really don’t understand how serious things can be. And it’s a bit of a taboo thing that not everyone wants to talk about so it’s even worse when people make fun. (Vs , say being like “oh yeah I’ve struggled w alcoholism” is a lot more accepted )"
selfharm,eqqa8oq,t1_eqqa69b,1560216238.0,Honestly adding vanilla to anything kicks it up a notch. Even pancake mix ! (Breakfast is my favourite meal of the day )
selfharm,eqq981f,t3_bz5xtm,1560215439.0,"My French toast recipe that I honestly love and it can be sweet enough without syrup! (Or even just a little) (this works for 3 slices , you could probably use this to make a 4th slice too) 

- 3 eggs
- 1/4 cup milk
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

Soak the bread in it , both sides, for about 30 seconds. Then put it on a pan and cook on medium/low-medium. Flip after about 2 mins and then flip again a few minutes later. Then you’re good! I sometimes add a bit of cinnamon too."
selfharm,eqq7e55,t3_byzp4t,1560214043.0,I used to do this all the time. Now I have a tendency to sort of bend over and grab /dig my nails into the inside of my thigh when I get mad.
selfharm,eqq5wvw,t3_bz301x,1560212956.0,I’m so proud of you! That’s amazing ! It’s all about the first step :)
selfharm,eqq5onn,t3_bz4hc8,1560212786.0,"Sending you hugs 🤗 🤗🤗 if you need to talk /want someone to lean on , PM me :)"
selfharm,eqq5m9k,t3_bz5h6u,1560212739.0,I’m so sorry this happened to you. I’ve also had coworkers be like “oh haha I used to do that” for some of us it’s a very real problem /addiction ://
selfharm,eqhied7,t3_bygy9s,1560060095.0,You can do it ! In all honesty the first month is ALWAYS the hardest. You’ve got this
selfharm,eqhey1o,t3_bygp7u,1560056799.0,Maybe ask her how she’s feeling ? Be over dramatic about it. It’ll help put into perspective that she’s kind of demeaning people who actually struggle? Idk if that makes sense or not
