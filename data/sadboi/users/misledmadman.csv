There are always things to fix with a game this big but damn is it good. I can actually enjoy COD for once.

My only gripe is a lag issue when I respawn in game modes with the zoom in animation. In the grand scheme of things that isn’t anything big."

I’m not sure about the one with the police officer so I can’t comment on that but we know there are real POS cops out there. I’m not giving them a pass. If they abuse power they need to get their asses handed to them.

The immigrants who come here illegally spit in the face of everyone who goes through the process. Not all immigrants have good intentions. They are also coming here on their own free will for the most part. The difference here is they have a choice and we don’t.

Use your head on this one folks."
