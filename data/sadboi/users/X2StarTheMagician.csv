depression,erlv1qe,t3_c2q6to,1560997623.0,"Honestly the first thing you can do is just vent, this is a very safe place to talk about depression, (almost) all the users here have depression so they know what it feels like in a way. Venting has saved me from suicide in the past, So it can at least help a little, sure it may not be much but you can run if you cant walk. Every step counts, even the little ones, i hope you can get back on your feet and have a happy life, venting is one thing that you can start with, i am not the best person to ask for advice but i can defiantly tell you we will never judge you for your gender, your race, your age, your sexuality, your mental state and even the things you have done, i wouldn't judge you (unless you start dancing around singing the wheels on the bus go round and round while worshiping Satan in order to turn the world into a big bottle of mustard and a taco bell flying in space) that's really all i have to say so stay in there

depression,erlu0s6,t3_c2pygd,1560996825.0,"Hmm, i actually heard of a story somewhat similar to this, and let me tell you it did not go well 0\_0.

Hormones can cause depression (Too Much Thyroids) HOWEVER even if this is the case, its still something to worry about, lets say i had a friend named bill okay, he loved to joke around and stuff, one day he says he is sad and wants to die, everyone laughs because they think he is just trying to be funny but in reality he is depressed, for the rest of the year bill doesn't arrive and the whole class then realizes he wasn't joking, to sum the entire story up, It doesn't matter what is causing it (well i mean it does but you get my point) its the problem its self that is important. It doesn't matter how you got depression, what matters is you have depression and i think you should tell your mother what i just said. If your mother still doesn't care, tell someone else that's close to you. I wish you best of luck with the rest of your life and don't ever be afraid to tell someone about depression, depression is the most common mental disorder, hell all my friends have depression (but that might just be because i pick kids who are lonely) so if you tell someone you care about (and cares for you) there is a 0.00000000000000000000000000% chance that they won't know what to do (unless they tried literally everything) so to wrap this around with a bow, yes, try to tell her. And like i said, its not the cause that matters (i mean it does but still), its the problem that does (at least when were talking about depression) so yeah, i wish you best of luck.

I wish i could be there to help you but i am afraid all i can do is support you and talk to you. I told someone once that people bully someone because they feel like your better then them and they want you to feel like they have control over you. And besides you said your doing summer school right? now i live in Canada and i have no idea exactly what summer school is besides school in the summer, but what i do know is people who failed have to go to summer school, so these guys are basically bullying you because you want to get an answer right. Don't take this the wrong way but your classmates seem like total retards from the sounds of it. I say take your time with an answer so you can get it right, that is the only way to succeed in life, my mother knows people like these retards you have for classmates and there lives are not going so well, if you ever need to talk this is a safe place of doing it, best of luck for you"
depression,eow4h1c,t3_btcz9a,1558904935.0,"I am very sorry to hear about your situation. I have had thoughts like yours before and they are awful. And i would like to give you some tips and ideas, while they may not all work at least give them a try. Body, You can change the way you look with the right food and right exercise, though that's easier said then done which i totally understand. But with enough determination you can get it done. Bullies, You cant change the past, only the future. Bullies bug people because most of the time they think your better then them and they just want to be d###s to you so they feel like they have power over you. Motivation, Now i am not sure how to help here but try meditation, if anything it could help your overall emotions. Its quite a lot to say so google it as i don't think i can write a hundred paragraph long page. Spend more time with your boyfriend if he makes you happy, and when you have to go always look forward to the next time you see him. and finally rant. Ranting here is 101% allowed, its one of the reasons why this page exists in the first place, if you want to talk to people who go through slimier things, this is the place, we will never judge you for your actions, your looks, your sexuality, your race, your religion or your hobbies. This is a safe place. And i wish you the best of luck for you, stay strong."
depression,eow157c,t3_btcijg,1558903673.0,"I may not be the best of help for you but i do have tips that have worked for me. You can always adopt these tips and turn them into something that will work for you.

So here. 1. Don't Over Work. This is the best way to fail, when you run into burn out, take a break no matter what. Human beings cannot function when there burnt out. 2. Try Meditation, Meditation can calm one down, And i would recommend it. 3. Ignore your mother, You where a good student before the devil started playing with you, She seems like she has forgotten that you where doing well. 4. Ignore what the devil says, an obvious one, depression lies, just like the devil, i go through O.C.D which can give me horrible thoughts and never stop pestering me with it until it realizes i am too busy to listen to the little F###er . 5. Only do what you think you are capable of doing, if you cant do it now, do something else and then come back to it. 6. Never give up. Another Obvious one, you cant move forward if you walk backwards, even in the darkest times there is light, there was a post on here not long ago about a guy in the same situation as you and he managed to do it, i am not saying you WILL graduate but you do have the chance. 7. Talk to your teacher, tell them about what your going through and maybe they will understand, there human too. Don't do it if your teacher hates you though. 8. Even if you fail know you tried your best, its not fair to be judged on grades, you never know how that person is feeling, even if you do end up repeating a grade remember that you did your best and you should be proud of it, your teacher probably will too. 9. Post here. This is a safe place to rant and we will never judge you for it. and 10. Don't be afraid to ask for help (yeah i am running low on ideas -\_-) you probably know this one but you would be surprised how few people ask for help when they need it, i can see your dad is helping with you and that's great, maybe you should ask your teacher about it too, they will understand (unless there pr###s) and will most likely be happy to help you. I do hope you find success soon and know that there are people like me listening and understanding your problem (even if its only a little bit) So yes i hope you finish school on a high note and i wish you the best of luck."

gamedev,eovutg9,t3_btc6bj,1558900991.0,"Music. No matter who you are music can affect you, Its completely Psychological and will most likely affect most of the audience. Music has this strange emotional impact that many other forms of art don't. Like when you watch a Disney movie and start to tear up, yeah there is the imagery but the music is what impacts you (Take Toy Story 3 for an example). So if you want the best results i would recommend music. Search up instruments that can give you shivers and then slow it down. I have done this many times in the past and i am currently working on my own Psychological horror. In case you need tips on how to make creepy music allow me to help. 1. use artificial sounds, sounds humans nor nature can produce. 2. Reverse, Example: Lets say i took TouHou - Bad Apple and reversed it, the reason it would be creepy is because its close to a real song but slightly off. 3. Infra-sound, Infra-Sound is sound that is under 20 Hz, the human brain cannot hear it but it can feel it causing uneasiness. If you use music try to avoid MP3 files if your using infra-sound as the MP3 encoder will remove it. 4. Distortion, Dont go overboard with this as it can get annoying, but in the right amount, it can chill you to the bone. And my last bit of advice is the 6-Minute Rule, A rule i made where the song must be 6 Minutes long or more, if the song is over 6 minutes without editing then you might have to make a few cuts. Anyway i hope this helps, and if you finish your game send me a copy i would love to play it :)"

Those people who say they care and then insult you should be ashamed as it is not fair to hurt someone who is already hurt. And i thank god you cant afford a gun and you are ""too much of a pussy"" which is a lie, don't take the easy way out of life, i don't exactly know how i can help you besides praying but all i can say is keep living, I may not know you but i am a man with a golden heart and i have come here to help others (even if its only a sliver of hope) and i get why you would never trust me from your history about opening up to people, i do know that this is a safe place to do so however.

I wish i could suggest something to help you but all i can do is pray for you and your family. Your brother must have been a great person and i am deeply sorry for your lose. If you ever need to talk about it, this is a safe place to do so. Again i am very sorry and i hope things get better, it may take time but as long as you keep living things. I know that may sound dumb and i really don't know what or how to say it, i have never experienced that kind of pain before, but i am sure that someone on this forum has and know that your not the only one who has lost a family member or a friend to suicide.

But you know what, you are doing something many others cant and that's moving forward, i bet you ten bucks that the others couldn't even go a day if they were going through the same thing as you. Now i do have another piece of advice i would like to share and its meditation. I have done it before and for a guy who suffers with O.C.D and a handful of mental illnesses, it helped. It clears your mind and can make you feel happier. I don't know if you have tried this before but even if you have try doing it again, look for motivational youtube videos or daydream about something awesome, that helps me and yeah pretending may sound ""Childish"" but its all in your head and no one will know ( Unless you start screaming ""Attack the fluffy marshmallow demons from the swamp"" which is what i did once ). I hope you will find motivation. You sound like you really deserve better. Next time you feel like your ""Disappointing""  just remember that your doing way better at pulling through the day then most others. And you should feel proud of that, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Your unique in your own way and that is another thing that others cant do. So again i wish you luck"
depression,eosxmek,t3_bt1oj4,1558831244.0,"Why do you think you deserve it? 

I don't judge you for cutting yourself but it does come with health issues and from what i know can lead to suicide (then again that was assumption really because most people i know who used to cut themselves eventually killed themselves) 

And as for why do you deserve it?

No one deserves pain, no one deserves to be depressed.

You deserve a happier life from what i can gather from the short post.

If you still think you should cut yourself, then i would find something else to do like taking a walk or something to get it off your mind. I hear music is psychological and can in fact help you when your down. I hope you get happier somewhere in the near future"
depression,eoswy1o,t3_bt1jlg,1558830861.0,"Don't take this the wrong way but what kind of friend doesn't hang out with you?

I am sorry if i offended you but i don't understand how he has time for others and not for you.

If he can hang out with another friend, he really should be helping a friend in need.

If you just want to talk i understand, this is a safe place to rant and i nor anyone else here judge you for that. We all have s### days, weeks and hell even years. I am also going through a s### year, i tried hanging myself a while ago and only stopped because i couldn't find a place to hang myself.

You seem to be doing a far better job, and while i don't like cutting, hey at least you went a couple months without doing it. But back to what i was saying if you need to rant, then go ahead and do so, this is one of the reasons why this place is here to begin with and i hope you life gets better."

Some may be fast others are slow and just because you cant do one thing does not mean you cant do another. Sorry i don't really understand depression but try taking a break every now and then, forcing yourself to work after burn out is the best way to fail. Sometimes i need to take breaks from what i am doing like one time in math class i was learning some s### and i was so overwhelmed, i decided to take a walk for a couple minutes just ranting to myself about it. What i am saying is take some time off, if you feel like you cant go on with a project, then take a break. No one should judge you for it and if they do there F###ing morons. All humans need breaks some more then others. While i may be really good at math, my mental math is beyond bad and everyone just thinks i am a moron. As my last bit of advice before i go i would like to say screw whoever thinks your lazy, if your trying your best then your doing your best and you should feel proud of that. Even if you have to work extra hard just to meet the ""Slandered"" Goal. And even if you don't do so good, don't feel down as you did your best and that's all you could do.

Why not talk to your best friend about whats going on, If she is your best friend then she will listen. Sometimes all you need is someone to talk to. If you don't feel like leaving your house, invite her over even if its a quick chat. And my last bit of advice is always distract yourself. Now i could be completely wrong as everyone works differently but if you feel like killing yourself, find something you love doing and just do that, ignore anything else. Its better to take a day off and regain some mental strength rather then struggling to make it. I hope this helps you, and i wish you the best of luck."
