kratom,fj4s3gm,t3_fbgjr6,1583015557.0,My spouse or dad go pick it up for me when they are in the area for work. At first they didn't think it does anything but have seen how much it helps. My dad has a temp worker for an out of town job n the guy got up and had it in his Shaker and dad goes so is that Bali or maenga da. The guy was impressed lol

bulimia,fhhffpr,t3_f393z0,1581602900.0,I'm so sorry you are dealing with this. Has your gp tried getting in contact with your insurance to discuss the bulimia? Insurance companies are a joke. I've had them deny meds because according to them they don't seem needed and my Dr has sent a letter stating why it's medically necessary to be on the med. I've been in n out of treatment so many times. One time I was actually trying and doing ok and insurance decided I was recovered enough and I got discharged. After that was one of my worst relapses

kratom,ff9ut93,t1_ff9lnl2,1579721899.0,"Exactly! I was on a fent. Patch, morphine, and oxy for pain, Ambien for sleep and Ativan for anxiety. All those drugs have side effects and really shouldn't probably taken all together. But 1 plant was able to change it all. And like my moods and energy are improved so much. It's like people don't want to take the time and learn about something that is life changing"
