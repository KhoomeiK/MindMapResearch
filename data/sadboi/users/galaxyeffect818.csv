I reached out to the director of the psychology post bacc program in my city and she suggested I complete the post bacc program (get amazing research experience, grades, etc) and then apply to a masters (to ultimately do doctoral program). So a post bacc program might be in your best interest as well!

Edit: replaced PhD with doctoral program"

Also, this particular baby used to have red tips. Would that still indicate a sun burn if it‚Äôs sun stress marks are disappearing? Unless they‚Äôre not sun stress marks? I haven‚Äôt watered it in two weeks (prior to this post, watered that day) if that also helps."

succulents,ez6mac6,t3_d05uxg,1567713499.0,"Out of all my succulents, these babies seem to have wrinkly leaves that haven‚Äôt improved after watering. Since repotting, I‚Äôve watered them 3 times on 07/23, 08/10, and 08/23 (I‚Äôm avoiding overwatering them). I usually water them from the top and let them soak until the soils dry (or around two weeks). I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overwatering or if they‚Äôre thirsty. The reason I thought it was possible overwatering was due to the yellowing of some leaves as seen at the top two pics. The bottom succulent also has tiny dead leaves which I‚Äôm assuming is a normal part of growth. If it helps, they‚Äôre next to a south facing window and receive light throughout the whole day. They‚Äôre planted in bonsai jack soil. Also, I‚Äôm not sure what the bottom succulent ID is. Any ID guessed would be great!"
