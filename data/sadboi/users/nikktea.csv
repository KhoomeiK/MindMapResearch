On your medications, do you still experience highs and lows? Is it unrealistic to expect those to totally go away? I’ve been suffering my whole life but only just got help and a diagnosis 2 months ago, so I’m still figuring this all out."

The texts he would send were a grooming mechanism that he was clearly somewhat adept at, so that tells me I wasn’t the first young female student he’d pulled this shit with.

Long story short, caused so much noise about it that the president of the school met with me and promptly fired the professor and set campus police up at all of the entrances of the school so that if he came on campus again, he’d be arrested.
