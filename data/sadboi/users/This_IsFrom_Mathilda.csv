confessions,fqe7fv4,t1_fppl7z3,1589302982.0,"Wow that does sound scary. That sort of stuff happened to me a lot during panic attacks, I looked like I was having a seizure. Thinking back on it that probably has something to do with how the Tourettes developed. About the meds and therapy thing, I honestly think everyone could benefit from therapy even if they don‚Äôt have any diagnoses but it sounds like you probably have some sort of anxiety disorders and I would highly recommend looking into someone to talk to. About medication, I think that‚Äôs something you should discuss with a therapist (psychologist) first before going to a psychiatrist because the psychiatrist‚Äôs job is to prescribe so of course they‚Äôre going to. But with a therapist you can probably work through most things and then if there‚Äôs still some baseline problems then that means you probably have some chemical imbalances which *then* can be helped with the right dosage."

selfharm,fozwhcx,t1_foztfhi,1588198099.0,"you can and you will! your scars prove all that you have been able to overcome. one thing that has been helping me in loving myself enough to not want to hurt myself is thinking back on all the little or big moments where i‚Äôve closed the bedroom door, slid down the wall, and cried, left the room to go to the bathroom and cry, all the panic attacks i‚Äôve had alone, in silence. think about those moments from another person‚Äôs perspective. i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre quite an empathetic person because you‚Äôve gone through a lot and know what it‚Äôs like to be down. look at those moments like that. think of how much you‚Äôve been through and you‚Äôre still here fighting things head on. be the warm supporting voice for yourself that you would be for someone else going through this. so many of us could think of so many reasons why we deserve to self harm but would never tell that to anyone else and have probably even helped many others to abstain from it. but we hold ourselves to such higher and impossible standards and that‚Äôs not fair. give yourself the love you deserve. another little trick that i like is whenever you have an urge go do something nice for yourself. my favorite is to get a nice lotion and rub it in the spot where i want to self harm. or go take a bubble bath, do a face mask, buy something nice for yourself, eat something sweet. learn to react with kindness to yourself in tough times not even more trauma."
selfharm,fozseli,t3_gafpik,1588196042.0,first i would advise just telling him because it will hurt him even more later if he finds out on his own. makeup can work well but you want to make sure that your wounds aren‚Äôt open at all or else it could sting. depending on the cut just normal liquid foundation or concealer applied in the direction of the cut can be okay but if you can still see a clear difference in your skin i‚Äôd recommend a green concealer that‚Äôs made to cancel out redness in skin or some light green eyeshadow put on first and then your regular shade of foundation.
selfharm,fozqsm8,t3_gahu8y,1588195244.0,"i know exactly how you feel. the one thing i can say is with every urge that you overcome, the stronger you get and the more time there is between each urge. think about a future without self harm and realize that you *can* get there one day at a time."

Tourettes,etg1jye,t3_cbjwxu,1562781994.0,it sounds more like a compulsion. i know it can be difficult to tell the difference if there isn‚Äôt an intrusive thought behind it (obsession) but there‚Äôs a category of ocd that people call ‚Äújust rightness ocd‚Äù because the obsession is an intrusive feeling of discomfort or something just being ‚Äúnot right‚Äù so the compulsions are usually movements or touching something until it feels right.

OCD,esqof6d,t3_c8tjpu,1562206568.0,"yes this is actually a common form of ocd that falls under the category of ‚Äújust rightness‚Äù ocd. it‚Äôs called just rightness ocd because there‚Äôs really no logic behind it, no reason for you to do it besides it just doesn‚Äôt feel right. you don‚Äôt hear much about this kind of ocd because usually there‚Äôs no intrusive thought but intrusive feelings which are a lot harder to understand and explain. instead of there being a thought of something bad happening and the compulsion being something to prevent that from happening, there‚Äôs an intrusive uncomfortable feeling and you have to do the compulsion to get rid of. i‚Äôve experienced this since i was little, i always called it ‚Äúbeing even‚Äù cause i didn‚Äôt know about ocd at the time but after a lot of time searching the web i could find a few little things about it but not much. these compulsions can be helped with exposure and response therapy in which you‚Äôll probably make a hierarchy of which compulsions bug you least to most and start with the easier ones. they‚Äôll have you do things to make the intrusive feeling come on but not allow you to do the compulsion or make you do a different action instead of the compulsion in order to redirect it sorta. don‚Äôt do this on your own though, only do it with a therapist/specialist/whatever tf because it can create a lot of anxiety if you jump into right away. i hope this helped and maybe taught you a few things! you‚Äôre not alone(:"
