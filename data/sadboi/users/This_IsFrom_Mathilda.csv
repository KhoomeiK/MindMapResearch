Tourettes,fqkt0e7,t1_fqkrxew,1589435443.0,I have talked to my teacher about this almost all year but she’s been just as clueless as me. I would have to contact the college board which is almost impossible on my own and my parents are unsupportive of my Tourette’s so they would not contact them (if that would even result in anything)

edit: be careful though placing makeup on cuts. if they are open it could lead to infection or sting a lot."

confessions,fqe7fv4,t1_fppl7z3,1589302982.0,"Wow that does sound scary. That sort of stuff happened to me a lot during panic attacks, I looked like I was having a seizure. Thinking back on it that probably has something to do with how the Tourettes developed. About the meds and therapy thing, I honestly think everyone could benefit from therapy even if they don’t have any diagnoses but it sounds like you probably have some sort of anxiety disorders and I would highly recommend looking into someone to talk to. About medication, I think that’s something you should discuss with a therapist (psychologist) first before going to a psychiatrist because the psychiatrist’s job is to prescribe so of course they’re going to. But with a therapist you can probably work through most things and then if there’s still some baseline problems then that means you probably have some chemical imbalances which *then* can be helped with the right dosage."

Along with playing video games or watching shows/movies I can lose myself in. And yes Tourettes truly is an ass but I’ve grown a bit with it since first developing and I hope that’ll continue:)

selfharm,fozwhcx,t1_foztfhi,1588198099.0,"you can and you will! your scars prove all that you have been able to overcome. one thing that has been helping me in loving myself enough to not want to hurt myself is thinking back on all the little or big moments where i’ve closed the bedroom door, slid down the wall, and cried, left the room to go to the bathroom and cry, all the panic attacks i’ve had alone, in silence. think about those moments from another person’s perspective. i’m sure you’re quite an empathetic person because you’ve gone through a lot and know what it’s like to be down. look at those moments like that. think of how much you’ve been through and you’re still here fighting things head on. be the warm supporting voice for yourself that you would be for someone else going through this. so many of us could think of so many reasons why we deserve to self harm but would never tell that to anyone else and have probably even helped many others to abstain from it. but we hold ourselves to such higher and impossible standards and that’s not fair. give yourself the love you deserve. another little trick that i like is whenever you have an urge go do something nice for yourself. my favorite is to get a nice lotion and rub it in the spot where i want to self harm. or go take a bubble bath, do a face mask, buy something nice for yourself, eat something sweet. learn to react with kindness to yourself in tough times not even more trauma."
selfharm,fozseli,t3_gafpik,1588196042.0,first i would advise just telling him because it will hurt him even more later if he finds out on his own. makeup can work well but you want to make sure that your wounds aren’t open at all or else it could sting. depending on the cut just normal liquid foundation or concealer applied in the direction of the cut can be okay but if you can still see a clear difference in your skin i’d recommend a green concealer that’s made to cancel out redness in skin or some light green eyeshadow put on first and then your regular shade of foundation.
selfharm,fozqsm8,t3_gahu8y,1588195244.0,"i know exactly how you feel. the one thing i can say is with every urge that you overcome, the stronger you get and the more time there is between each urge. think about a future without self harm and realize that you *can* get there one day at a time."

Tourettes,fhyf9hm,t1_fhyet3o,1581974737.0,i would not worry too much about it though because if you’re older and you have ocd then a late onset of tics could more likely be tourettic ocd meaning it’s connected to your ocd so worrying about it would only make things worse ❤️
Tourettes,fhyet3o,t3_f4k7z3,1581974478.0,this sounds like it definitely could be tics i have breathing tics as well where i take a lot of sharp small inhales. the feeling of a burst of energy/like your heart stops for a second is pretty spot on of what id describe the internal feeling tics give you but to really be sure i’d ask a doctor.

Tourettes,eyp9uci,t3_cxtts2,1567294075.0,i developed tourette’s after i had already been driving so i’m pretty comfortable with it. for some reason my tics seems to happen more when i’m in the car but it still hasn’t caused a problem. there’s been a few times where i let go of the wheel for a second and i have a head jerking tic that can make me take my eyes off the road but that’s about it. i’d say if you’re driving and you’re ticcing more than usual and getting concerned then maybe pull over for a second to calm down.

OCD,ex1c85s,t3_cqzvhl,1565938851.0,"you’re not a bad person. that’s what ocd is, it’s not your fault. you have to learn to accept that these are just unwanted thoughts, or spam mail. it’s important that you’re able to catch yourself when you’re stuck in thought spirals like this, too. i know sometimes it feels like you’ve just gotten sucked out of reality and completely enveloped in the intrusive thoughts but accepting that it’s just your ocd setting off all these false alarms (as i like to call them) instead of actually investigating is how you can prevent some of these spirals. i highly advise seeing a therapist or counselor that can help guide you through it cause that has helped me a lot. hearing you talk about hating yourself so much because of these thoughts hurts because i know exactly how you feel. a lot of people with ocd including me have those kinds of intrusive thoughts. you’re not alone. you’re not crazy. you can pm me any time if you want to talk more. i’d be glad((:"

Anxiety,ew38dtk,t3_cmkv4d,1565067688.0,"i know exactly how you feel no joke. i’ve done very similar things except i’m younger so i’m just talking like end of the semester projects in high school that are weighted a shit ton. you may not think this wasn’t a huge deal because it’s not a big university thing but it absolutely killed me because i have horrible anxiety about my grades and am always wanting to be better than i am. i was late on so many big assignments at the end of the semester and got fucking accommodations that my therapist worked so hard to get me and i used them to get more time for these assignments and was still late on them. every time i sat down to do them i would start breaking down completely and it got to the point where i would just stop even trying to get it out. i would sit in my bed and think about how absolutely screwed i was if i didn’t do this work and just be frozen in fear. it makes me feel like a coward. i haven’t figured out how to really help with this. i go to therapy but i have other mental disorders that have recently been causing me more distress so we’ve been focusing more on that right now. i got myself in a similar situation at the end of second semester and i had my boyfriend help me with this by making me do my work. it was very overwhelming i started going into a panic attack but he helped me through it and once i started doing it, it was so much easier to just keep going. i think if you keep in mind that the hardest part is starting it and you just gotta get over that hill."

Tourettes,etg1jye,t3_cbjwxu,1562781994.0,it sounds more like a compulsion. i know it can be difficult to tell the difference if there isn’t an intrusive thought behind it (obsession) but there’s a category of ocd that people call “just rightness ocd” because the obsession is an intrusive feeling of discomfort or something just being “not right” so the compulsions are usually movements or touching something until it feels right.

OCD,esqof6d,t3_c8tjpu,1562206568.0,"yes this is actually a common form of ocd that falls under the category of “just rightness” ocd. it’s called just rightness ocd because there’s really no logic behind it, no reason for you to do it besides it just doesn’t feel right. you don’t hear much about this kind of ocd because usually there’s no intrusive thought but intrusive feelings which are a lot harder to understand and explain. instead of there being a thought of something bad happening and the compulsion being something to prevent that from happening, there’s an intrusive uncomfortable feeling and you have to do the compulsion to get rid of. i’ve experienced this since i was little, i always called it “being even” cause i didn’t know about ocd at the time but after a lot of time searching the web i could find a few little things about it but not much. these compulsions can be helped with exposure and response therapy in which you’ll probably make a hierarchy of which compulsions bug you least to most and start with the easier ones. they’ll have you do things to make the intrusive feeling come on but not allow you to do the compulsion or make you do a different action instead of the compulsion in order to redirect it sorta. don’t do this on your own though, only do it with a therapist/specialist/whatever tf because it can create a lot of anxiety if you jump into right away. i hope this helped and maybe taught you a few things! you’re not alone(:"
