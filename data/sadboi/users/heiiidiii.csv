Please know that people mourn in different ways, and there's no right or wrong way. I've heard people say ""my loved one died months ago, I'm still upset"" that's totally normal. You never really heal fully from the death of someone close to you, and that's fine. Take as much time as you need to yourself, and make sure to spend time with your family as well. You seem like an amazing sibling, and your sister was lucky to have you. 
Praying for you and your family ❤️"
