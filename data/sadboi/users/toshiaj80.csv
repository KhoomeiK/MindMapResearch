I don't know if this will be much help but if you tell the people at the hospital your living situation they should have some resources for help. Maybe through social services. In my area we have programs through a place called safehaven that will pay for long term housing for people with diagnosed mental health issues that are homeless or about to become homeless. I hope things get better for you!"
