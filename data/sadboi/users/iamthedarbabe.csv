Rollerskating has been my salvation for the last three years. It’s something I can do alone (with headphones!) but also with others, when I’m feeling better. I do my skating near my house on a trail that is next to the ocean. It’s also next to PCH. When people I know, or don’t know, drive by, they honk and wave. It’s been good therapy and i can skate pretty well now 💋❤️"
