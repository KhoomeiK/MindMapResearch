hockeyplayers,fqvz536,t1_fqvyj4z,1589688560.0,"No. The point to all of that was you can make strawman arguments all day. And while it hits close to home it doesn't actually hold any weight. Idk where you are from, but my state is very low and hasn't seen any increase of deaths. If you are in NY or NJ sure I get it, stay inside and don't travel. But we are good in our flyover states homie... Worry about yours

Edit: there are no cures for viruses, only treatments and vaccines. If you are waiting for a vaccine start stockpiling canned food."
hockeyplayers,fqvyatl,t1_fqvvybf,1589687975.0,"Well if we are going to talk about semantics then I'll go this route. Ok, so say I get boarded, or a teammate, or an opponent and becomes paralyzed. Well that is a risk everyone already knows is a risk that is possible. So what about the fallout. The persons responsible,I assume, would feel a guilt and possibly PTSD from said situation. That spreads to his family, they can no longer withstand what said person has turned into. They do what they can but can't ""fix"" him/her. Feeling disassociated, the person(s) has a mental break and this strawman shoots up a building full of kids. Everything has risks, 
Do or don't. I am not worried about a (at best) 5% mortality, I AM worried about my grandmother with diabetes, but she doesn't play hockey. High risk people should be very cautious, and so should the people that interact with them. But I truly do think that the media coverage has caused a mass hysteria, not saying we shouldn't take precaution, and people should clean themselves. Hell, I said it in March, if anything comes positive of this I hope it's that people realize how gross they are... 

TLDR: If you feel the risk is not worth it, don't do it."
