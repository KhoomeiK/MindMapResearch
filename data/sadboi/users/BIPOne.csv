Man up is a positive statement meant to instill the urge in the person in question, to seek out means to improve themselves.

The female equivalent would be nonexistant, as the statement ""man up"" is tied together with the stereotype of the ""strong alpha male"". Telling a woman to ""woman up"" would, applying the same ancient stereotype, indeed to ""hush and stay In the kitchen waiting for her hubby to come back and then pleasing him in every possible way.

Since this is the opposite of ""becoming stronger and confident and working on ones self"", womaning up would be the most sexist, controversial and abusive statement. 

It is thus logical, that we apply ""to man up"" for both genders.

""To man up: increasing ones confidence, getting a grip on their feelings and emotions, to overcome either a hardship, or taking an opportunity at a better life, or solving a tough situation after a moment of assumed helplessness."" - me, 2020

This tip applies to both genders."

Then we DO have incidents where radioactivity is released and those arent mentioned.

Almost all incidents listed on the web state that suddenly some country a few thousand miles away, ""detected a sudden spike in radioactivity, beyond the natural background radiation"".

It then takes several days, or at least one, for the countries to pinpoint, and the culprit admitting in russian style: ""Is of minor leak, nothing to worry about, friends!"", whilst the birds drop dead from the sky and everybody starts glowing so brightly they can read their books at night without turning the nightlight on.

This has always been an interesting subject to me, radioactivity, but also, the carelessness and disinterest in coming out, when clearly, something happened. 

That makes you wonder about the actual qualifications of nuclear workers and scientists, if they treat a blown up valve, or reactor seal, as if their car had a minor oil spillage.

Wipe it down with a cloth and we are good, no need to tell about anyone.

That is also the reason why nuclear power is so tightly overwatched and each country in the world  watches out for elevated radioacticity at their borders and in country, the people have learned that in some regards, NPP operators and engineers are not far from Fastfood worker intelligence.

Not saying fast food workers are dumb but dropping the burger on the ground and wiping it off and then still selling it, has the same basic level of negligence as shrugging at a blown up steam valve that just released several thousand metric kilograms of slightly radioactive vaporized water."

I assume that certain apps do cryptomining in the background. Otherwise I cant explain, logically, how a 2D game that is 50MB im size, strains the Phone more than an actual 3D game that has 2 or 3 gb size.

Neither do 2D games like GF or AL, and not even 2D/3D mixes like FFBE or Arknights or Evertale, or the Minecraft knockoff, that is entirely 3D based, dont heat up the phone."

Both are snarky and have good harsh attitudes, and the human element of emotions, sometimes wild ones. 

Bashir is too weird, cant explain it. Might be the Übermensch-like branding of his persona, genetically perfect and all that weirdness. 

Crusher lacks actual authority and hard headedness up until some point. Something both McCoy and Pulaski exhibit from the get go.

Phlox, I dont trust one of them weird looking alien types.



The Doctor in VOY can only move on a holodeck, and where holoemitters are present, until he gets his mobile holo emitter. This limits his capabilities a lot. He has no (originally intended) combat programming and no (vanilla) offense so he cannot defend himself properly. Thus he is also only able to defend his patients with talk, but not actions. Bones and Pulaski can shoot Phasers and use weapons made for melee combat. The Holodoc, isnt made for that.

Chapel, is mistaken for a Doctor but she is a Nurse, later on becoming a Doctor, way after the storyline of the original series. I would trust her but the series and even movies show her as very squeamish, an early variation of Deanna Troi or Beverley Crusher, very reluctant. Aside of one or two occasions where they all show actual courage and ovaries (female equivalent of 'showing they got balls'), they all have a slight cowardice inside of themselves.

Bones knows when a patient needs a stiff drink meant for a pair of lively grandpas, and when they need a kick or someone beating them.

If I was a Vulcan I would seek out Dr. M'Benga, who is a specialist in Vulcan medicine amd anatomy."

Its a sort of fungus. 

When it blooms by spreading those tentacles, every suitable plant in the vicinity, and a veeeeery large vicinity that is, a large radius, also affected by the windage, will get infected.

Basically what you can smoke for a high. The process of extracting it is tedious and expensive, even more so the higher grade the cannabis is.

One ounce of liquid oil can cost about 50 bucks, or more. Now to make it into a resin, you need a lot of it. So this person spent..I cant tell.

The size I cannot judge. It can be a small credit card sized sample, or a large actual pizza slice sized one. The former would maybe be half a grand, the latter would most likely be a multiple of that.

All depending on what I explained though. Quality, quantity and how the oil was acquired. Self harvested or bought."

Even if you count all the worlds population, it is doubt ful that one nation alone saves pretty much 1/3rd of each other country of the world.

With his math, his intervention and measures must have such an impact that the majority of people in every single country in the world, benefit from it.

This is practically implausible as the majority of people, if not all of them, have to thank their respective governments, who have taken measures themselves.

His intervention contributed, to a handful of countries, but there is a giant difference between contributing and being directly responsible. 

Responsibility means you are 100% credible for what happend and happens in the future, and contribution can mean helping in such a way that your actions take anywhere from 0.0001% or 99.9999% of the credit of what happened or happens."

At this high level, due to some enemies having a level cap and some levelling above the player at all times; how much easier do the perks make the gameplay compared to, lets say, level 20 or 30?

I have noticed that depending on builds, the gear makes a huge difference. Sadly guns dont break so all you need to find is that hunting rifle and max it out, or that plasma rifle and you win against most enemies.

Maybe just me, but I noticed that levelling alone and most perks do only affect the gameplay so slightly."

Per Email?

Genau. So wie die Kripo auch erst klingelt und freundlich fragt, ob man heute das Haus durchsuchen darf oder ob es morgen besser passt. Depp.

Wenn, dann lädt die Polizei immer gleich zur Vernehmung ins Revier ein.

Man stelle sich vor, man sendet eine Aussage ein, die man mit 20 Leuten zusammen abgesprochen hat. Die wollen die Sachlage aus deinem Gedächtnis und Mund hören. Alleine schon wegen der problematischen Fälschungssicherheit wird man keine Briefe als endgültige Aussage akzeptieren, egal ob handgeschrieben oder elektronisch.

Bei Briefen wie von Polizei oder Staatsanwaltschaft sieht das anders aus: deren Wort ist richterlich und gesetzlich abgesegnet und wenn dort eine Anschuldigung steht, dann hat diese Gewicht. Vor allem wenn diese ungerechtfertigt ist, das schießt dann auf den zurück, der das Ganze verbockt hat.

Acts like a good player but when you look, you see  ""op shop item"" here and ""kicking enemies"" there, acts like he does speedruns everyone does but suddenly you see that its not the case, his statement: ""Its own rules speedrun just for fun"".

Also known for stealing artwork and even claiming, ""i made this picture"".

Generally plays like a competitive player, but when you take a good look, you see that he uses his own rules, up to using cheats.

His video titles never ever include anything like ""bought items"" or ""glitches"", so the viewer is to assume that he play legit. But always uses cheats or buffs, and his fans call it ""skill"".

People pointed out in L4D and L4D2 speedruns, that he cheats and exploits, but he also does it in RE3 now, people noticed that he uses shop items (which give you buffs) and challenge him to do it without buffs, as the videos dont say anything about buffs. He thinks people are dumb and cant see."

But the interpolation software used to fill the pictures and footage inbetween each frame is horrible, there is severely distortesd artifacts visible during every fast and larger limb movement.

Less aggressive block search and more importantly, more frames with actual posed movement would have been better for interpolation.

When using motion interpolation, the go to way is always higher starting framerate. If you interpolate a low framerate footage, like a gif, or old 25fps footage, the result will always have morphing glitches and artifacts that look and appear like bent limbs and such. Distortion effects. Easily avoidable. But requires more work ofcourse."

explainlikeimfive,fni69l2,t3_g1wms2,1586974694.0,"It is the max pressure that you should apply for optimal grip and tire profile shape. Underpressure makes the tire flat, changing the wear profile and performance, to much increases wear on the inside due to the tire literally bloating  its running surface, and performance as well.

This applies to EACH AND EVERYTHING. To run optimally, you need to follow guidelines and such things. 

Its not that they account for human error. They almost exclusively factor safety, efficiency, speed of processing, etc., in.

In many appliances and jobs, human error ends with either injury of the person failing to follow a rule, or in losses, due to rules and regulations being ignored.

There is no safety net, per se. The safety net can be signs on a machine telling someone to tuck their beards and long hair in. Still people annually get scalped and degloved by the dozens all over the world. Thats not a fail of the procedure, but THAT is the human error factor.

So, no, not really. Instructions and edjucation around the work and appliance in question exists. But usually we trust that the people who get put into either appliance X, or job X, know what they are doing.

Often times, human error is the culprit called out in plane accidents, trains or ships, or car accidents. Everything worked perfectly - but you just cannot fight the human factor. Unless you either let computers or other devices control the thing in question.

And here we are, then the question arises, ""do we even need humans""? And a computer also only is as good as the person programming it. Also lots of human errors in programming, logical errors and variables that are unaccounted for. As you can see, its far from easy to design things without human error always being a cause for concern. 

Due to this, human error is mostly minimized by instructions, yadayada, I repeat myself; we generally minimize it and then assume that everything goes well."
