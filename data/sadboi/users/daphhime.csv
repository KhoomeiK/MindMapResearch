I was also planning on going to Minnesota to visit some friends and go to a con in late August. That’s more than likely not happing either.

Other minor things like getting a hair cut, new glasses (which I really need because my script is getting weaker and giving me headaches), and various family gatherings were cancelled."

Crossing my fingers for a season 3 so they can finish up the remaining arcs. And the spin-off manga. 

Live action TV: Mystery Science Theater 3000- What can I say I grew up on this. Partial to the Mike seasons but those were the ones I saw the most of growing up. Joel has his own charm. And I feel like I was in the minority that actually liked the Netflix seasons. Still a great example of doing a lot with so little."

Anxiety,forxf2y,t3_g8v0l8,1588020195.0,"I work in an “essential” job but I took the past month or so off because I did not feel safe where I worked (grocery store). I have asthma and other conditions that put me at risk. Worked called saying they expected me back this week. I said I’d contact my doctor to get their opinion.

I really don’t want to go back. Maybe it’s a sign that I should quit (was thinking of leaving this year anyway) but the fact that I’d have to hunt for a new job scares me too. Now it’s going to be even harder to find a new job  and I’d have no choice but to go back to doing retail despite the tole it took on my mental and physical health. 

Plus the conventions I wanted to go to (including one that I was going to next month) are all cancelled anyway, so I don’t see the point of anything anymore. It was the one time of year I got to see all my friends. 

Stuff being lifted makes no difference to me since I’m screwed no matter what."

I’ll never forget the confused look on these people’s faces as they stepped out of the limo. Judging by how young they all looked and what they were wearing, they were definitely there for a prom of some short."

2. Getting a hair cut. Which is what I wanted to do before the con in May. 

3. All of the restaurants!"
