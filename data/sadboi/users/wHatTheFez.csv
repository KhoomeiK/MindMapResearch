But if you mean that you're on omnibus 4 (volumes 7 and 8) then and you're still not enjoying it then you might not like the rest.  


Here's the bottom line though, if you like slice of life stories with depressing themes, it is without a doubt 100% worth reading the rest. I read it just over a year ago now and I still think about it all the time. Clearly though on this sub, people will be bias. I suggest you read up until the ending of volume 7 (half of omnibus 4) and if you're still not into it, then you should stop reading."
