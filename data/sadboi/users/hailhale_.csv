You have a right to express your feelings but not in the way you're going about it. Who the fuck wants to get yelled at? 

You need to work on yourself. Express your feelings in a different tone, not in an aggressive manner. I can see where she's coming from by saying your emotionally abusive. 

Also, she's working full time and supporting you? I wouldn't blame her for leaving you. She doesn't deserve your attitude.

If you value her and your relationship, you need to change your behavior."

Coming home and washing away all the nasty shit and feeling so clean and renewed is *so great*."
AskWomen,fnmr52g,t3_g2gwgz,1587076575.0,"Not me, but my sister has always been thin. Now, with her new boobs, she kind of looks heavier in the upper chest area. I honestly think she looked better without them. They don't fit her frame well."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fniv6ns,t3_g1to36,1586986930.0,"I think Betty White said something similar... ""have a pair of ovaries"" or something like that.

I completely agree though. I think we need to start saying ""grow a pair of ovaries"" or ""grow a vagina and deal with it""!

My father in law, when drunk, says stupid shit to my husband like ""what's the matter, does your pussy hurt?""  Motherfucker you wish you were tough like a pussy."

So many people are quick to say ""break up"", ""leave him/her"", but it's only up to you if you'd like to continue this relationship.

Think about your future with her and having kids. If you think you can work around this, do it. If you can't see yourself being with someone with such beliefs, then you should probably leave."

I've often told him I wished it was smaller.."

selfimprovement,fneef3f,t3_g0wuch,1586887891.0,"For most of my life I felt the same way, that I don't fit in and I feel like a wallflower. Like I just watch people converse.

I recently started speaking up and putting my two cents into conversations whether I was asked or not.  I'm there, I exist, and I want to be apart of the conversation. I matter. I frankly don't care if I wasn't asked or if no one was talking to me.

Of course I'm not rude about it and I try to be as respectful as I can be. But I care very little about what people think of me. They will either like you or dislike you no matter what you do, so might as well insert yourself into conversations. You never know, people might respect you more for speaking up."

NatureIsFuckingLit,fnbxhr7,t1_fnbt4tb,1586824279.0,"I've seen a documentary about these birds. The bigger chick kept picking on the smaller chick when the mom was away. 


Eventually the mom started favoring the bigger chick.  The small one waddled over to its mom for food, but she fed the big one instead. Her and the bigger baby left the smaller one to die. 

It was sad, but the narrator explained that these birds have two chicks, and one chick is used as a back up if the other one dies."
Showerthoughts,fnbucrj,t1_fnbsdea,1586822493.0,"That's true. I just wonder if pets overeat because they think they won't get food for a while. So if food is in their bowl at all times, will it eventually learn that it doesn't need to overeat?"
