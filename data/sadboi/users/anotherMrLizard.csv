ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fo86la2,t1_fo7tyg0,1587590819.0,"No-one's saying it was communism, that's not the point. You can't use the extraordinary actions of a single individual operating within a certain system to prove the efficacy of that system unless you can make a convincing case that that individual couldn't have have accomplished what they did under another system.

Also, for most of human history the norm has been extended family groups in which taking care of the young was a collective responsibility. Even when the nuclear family became a thing, provisions were made for taking care of orphans."
