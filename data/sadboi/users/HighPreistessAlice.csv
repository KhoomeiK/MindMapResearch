residentevil,fmv7f2c,t1_fmsa4t1,1586408097.0,It is super tough to use. I think the most useful part Is that you can stop controlling it and it will be a wall until you use it again. Putting it on choke points and objectives is how I do it

SquaredCircle,fgk1did,t1_fgisix3,1580855489.0,I would adore that for Suzuki. It would build him up like a final boss in NJPW. New Japan is all about fighting spirit. The story of Suzuki crushing that fighting spirit would be brilliant only for the fighting spirit of a babyface (Ibushi or Goto if I were to choose) to finally beat him

SquaredCircle,fgi7ols,t1_fghw69r,1580809918.0,They did it once in NXT but I think they should bring back winning by KO for Asuka. Give her a strong strike finish and let her knock people out with it.

SquaredCircle,fbv2nix,t3_eed48r,1577124407.0,"Something I always loved about that segment was Macho and Piper leaving commentary to help Hogan. It shows just how big of a deal Taker was. Something about Macho’s “Let’s Go” when they left commentary made it stick with me. Maybe it’s the urgency, I do not really know. Awesome segment"

Tekken,faqsxlt,t1_faqs65u,1576307683.0,All of these are very reasonable and I agree with 99% of it. I personally like ff3 the way it is (because it’s a high and I have seen people be hit out of it) but I think that the change you proposed to it would still be fine and I could get over it.

SquaredCircle,f9m9335,t1_f9kvlfh,1575446864.0,I think it’s because Rollins had one of the most memorable turns in history. It’s kinda hard to forget something that well done that every single fan will remember. I think they would do this to Owens (for the Festival of Friendship) if 1. Jericho was still in the WWE fold and 2. If Owens wasn’t I heel after the time.

kof,f9fqk6h,t1_f9fcb64,1575283274.0,This helps a bunch. I do have a question though. What do you mean about Terry having a hard time landing specials?
Tekken,f8v6w4v,t1_f8v52ge,1574861487.0,You know that actually makes a lot of sense to me. Recognizing one of my problems is a really good thing. Not sure what to do with that though.
MortalKombat,f8uv09d,t1_f8ukf28,1574845660.0,That’s completely understandable. I just think it’s neat looking
MortalKombat,f8todjz,t1_f8th40p,1574807789.0,It seems cool it’s just not what I want as the moment. I know it’s the combo one so it will probably give big damage

List Jericho was just the highlight of wrestling every single week regardless of company. The festival of friendship is my favorite Raw segment.


My third favorite is probably Alpha Jericho. Just an unhinged, unpredictable psychopath. His appearances felt special because it could happen at any time."
