Among many other issues the show has when looked at from that point of view It also implies you, the deceased, will get some sort of closure if you leave enough notes (tapes), when in reality very little would come from said letters and regardless you, the deceased, will not know one way or another. Had they not gone the rout of promoting it brining awareness I wouldn’t care one way or another about the show but I think it’s really misleading and damaging, especially to younger people."

If a store won’t be restocked for a week and a mother with 3 kids doesn’t have the needed food, TP, and soap to keep her kids fed, clean and health their is a higher chance they will get sick not to mention the additional stress it causes them. It also leads to the chain reactions, you go the next week and stock pile so you dont run out and so the stores run out of product again, and the next week the same thing happens; Someone else comes in and stock piles and once again the stores run out of product, And this keeps happening. Now yes over time everyone will have what they need as less and less people go to the store but it also means until that happens their is going to be more and more panicking. Also a lot of the people who are hoarding are buying way more product then they will use before the product itself expires. People who are filling their carts with hand sanitizer for their family of 3 who are also socially distancing them self aren’t likely to use up all the hand sanitizer before it’s expired. Meanwhile I know teachers who haven’t been able to find any hand sanitizer to keep in their classrooms for the students whose schools are still open. There is a chain reaction that people forget about that ultimately make an already stressful situation even worse."

Driving around Chattanooga, Tenn., they hit a Dollar Tree, then a Walmart, a Staples and a Home Depot. At each store, they cleaned out the shelves.

Over the next three days, Noah Colvin took a 1,300-mile road trip across Tennessee and into Kentucky, filling a U-Haul truck with thousands of bottles of hand sanitizer and thousands of packs of antibacterial wipes, mostly from “little hole-in-the-wall dollar stores in the backwoods,” his brother said. “The major metro areas were cleaned out.”

Matt Colvin stayed home near Chattanooga, preparing for pallets of even more wipes and sanitizer he had ordered, and starting to list them on Amazon. Mr. Colvin said he had posted 300 bottles of hand sanitizer and immediately sold them all for between $8 and $70 each, multiples higher than what he had bought them for. To him, “it was crazy money.” To many others, it was profiteering from a pandemic.”"
