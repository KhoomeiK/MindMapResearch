Trufemcels,fqgztc7,t3_ginlic,1589362904.0,"movies literally won‚Äôt allow ugly actresses to be in them even as a side character, but awkward unconventionally attractive guys like michael cera can be the lead role. jesus even in animated movies - when was the last time you saw a cartoon woman that didn‚Äôt look perfect? Meanwhile, men are allowed to be shown flawed and it‚Äôs accepted without a thought. It‚Äôs normalized for men to be seen as humans, but if we‚Äòre not a perfect VS model we‚Äôre completely disregarded and seen as worthless."
