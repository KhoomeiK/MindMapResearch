BipolarReddit,fl8sxkz,t3_fnbqis,1584931514.0,"Yup. The severity and frequency of my hypomanic episodes has just about doubled over the last 6 weeks. I went a full week on 3 hours of bad sleep a night. I am definitely feeling the strain of staying mindful in the face of a mad world.  My single biggest coping mechanism is spending time in the gym, 2-3 hours a day. Since gyms have closed (and rightly so), I am a little adrift. 

I have had to take a **lot** more ""stop and breathe"" breaks.  I cut news reading down to once per day.  I have eliminated ALL alcohol and caffeine use until further notice. I am making sure to not spend too much time in front of a screen. I am staying up on communications with a close friend and family. And it's still rough. I have had to talk myself down from nearly going full manic twice this week. 

But I have gotten this far in the face of a horrid  disorder, and I'll be damned if I let the fear overwhelm me. I may shake and cry, but I will not surrender to my fear. 

Please remember, there are some amazing humans out there working madly to help everyone, and to find solutions for us all. You are not alone, we are all together in facing this challenge.

This is the Araphoe and Roosevelt National Forest district, and gets far less traffic than anything anywhere near Boulder or Colorado Springs. There is a huge network of forest service roads that have dispersed camping all over.  There are maps available for the forest service roads that are open to the public. Find a rock fire ring already built, and you got a campsite. Bodies of water nearby other than the Poudre River are Chambers Lake and Long Draw Reservoir.

In the opposite corner of the state, The San Juan Mountains in southwestern Colorado IMO is the most beautiful part of the Rockies. The San Juan's can get up to 13,000-14,000 feet real quick so October might be out for some parts. Look between the towns of Ouray and Durango. Tons of great drive in campsites as well as dispersed camping. Ouray gets the busiest in this area. I would advise avoiding the Telluride area.

I also exercise quiet a bit, including some fairly serious weightlifting and cardio, so stuff can get bad quickly for me if I don't stay on my eating. Stable, I need about 2500-3000 cal per day. Then I have manic days where I eat 5000+ cal and still lose weight.  Like, ""TWO double burger combos at one of the fast food joints before going home for dinner"" type of overeating. My episodes can start, end, or go sideways rather quickly (hooray for rapid cycling), so I experience very sudden changes in my hunger response. It goes from stuffing anything I can reach in my face, to feeling a little nauseous just by looking at food. Hard to manage all that. 

The mechanism that I have found that works for me is a bathroom scale. I do NOT set a specific target weight, or chart my data points.  I simply step on when I wake up and before I got to bed.  If my weight drops below 132 then I eat an extra snack or two that day. If it goes below 130, I eat another full meal that day. No calorie counting or food logging. No self image talk or self-flagellation. The weight is just another number, like the day's temperature. This has been working well for me so far.

And you are correct that the carpet bombings of Dresden, Stuttgart, and Frankfurt and the like were also horrible. However I am highly doubtful that rendering more cities into radioactive rubble and slag is ever a reasonable or viable solution to any problem, even during WWII, even against an enemy as vicious and sociopathic as the Japanese have been. But you do you.

Yes, all war is hell. I would say the distinctions between the aerial bombings and the atomic bombings was twofold. First, a nuclear bombing is sudden and inescapable, and is entirely indiscriminate in it's destruction in a radius. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were intended to kill a large chunk of population in a short time frame. We were trying to shock the Japanese into submission, and it worked. 

Second, despite the eventual outcome of widespread destruction, the actual goal of the sustained but intermittent bombings of the German cities was to utterly cripple their manufacturing base (i.e. military targets of value). We were trying to slow down the Wehrmacht's numbers advantage, and it worked. And it really wasn't until the German's started to use residential and religious locations for emplacements that we started to be less specific in our bombings.

But really, I was just giving an example of a horrible reality being turned into a myth, in order to illustrate a point about science fiction trends."

scifi,fiw4pvl,t1_fival3c,1582775124.0,"The way I have come to look at it is this: for most of recorded history, humanity has had some kind of mythos as part of their world. The most commonly recognized examples of this are the Greek or Norse gods, and their stories.  In the modern era, it seems like science and reason have eclipsed our old mythologies. Many no longer believe in the divine, eldritch, or fey, at all.  I feel like sci-fi almost subversively became the mythos for the modern era, as there was no other part of the zeitgeist to speak to the mysteries that do exist in the nuclear age. 

My favorite examples of how this expresses itself are the Shakespearean but modern nature of the Star Trek: TNG characters, and how the Japanese converted the horror and sheer incomprehensibility of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, into the myth of Gojira/Godzilla.  And, yeah, as our collective human experiences the difficult transition from the nuclear to the digital age I think you can see this shift in mythos happen almost in real time. I'm not sure that I could make a compelling thesis from it, but i think it's an interesting way to view sci-fi.

As far as the ground in relation to the pole: the pole will typically sink down with the ground, as the collapsing of aquifers happens hundreds to thousands of feet deep. So, the whole local area sinks, and the pole would only fall over if the bottom soil or the regolith layers became unstable. Subsidence usually occurs deeper down in or near bedrock.

And I think that a desire to be such strong and independent woman is on no way a symptom of mental illness. Bon apetit!

Are there times when you feel driven to sex rather than attracted to it? There are times when I really want to taste and feel a delicious fresh baked french pastry because it sounds freakin' great with a cup of coffee, and there are times when I am sadly standing in the supermarket on a Saturday night trying to stop myself from buying Oreos again. Was it desire or was it need that I was feeling? Did I leave the experience feeling peace, regret, or a mix? Did I wake up wondering 'why'? Did I forget to feed the dog because omg Becky did you see his shoulders!?!  At what point will **you** feel that the pursuit of sex has compromised other parts of your life? Decide that, then put a conscious and stated/written boundary on it and go from there.

If you are looking for a control mechanism, maybe a stick-and-carrot?  You only to get to have casual sex if you do 'X' (house chores, exercise goals, financial goals, whatevs). You can even make it a running game with points for achieving goals, and a weekly/monthly score if that motivates you.  Earn your dessert, girl!

In the end, you will have to decide at what point it causes damage to your state of mind or your life. You can do this by going hard, finding your limit, then relaxing back from that point like you did last summer. Or you can approach your sexual activity from the cautious side and add frequency/intensity etc as you feel confident over time.  Yes, it is an ongoing balancing act for many of us. As usual, journaling might be beneficial here to look back for trends.

And even getting 6 hours of sleep every night could still not be enough for some people to be healthy.

And the adrenaline and cortisol can build up over time. So, the longer the manic episode is, then not only is your body working very hard to keep the accelerated pace up but it will have to work just as hard to metabolize all of those things and their byproducts out of your blood stream.

BipolarReddit,fdhbvqn,t3_eldhfz,1578419612.0,"I too received the gift of BP from a parent. Their illness also was hideously destructive to my childhood, especially as they lacked a partner to help with child care. It took a long while, but I eventually came to accept and love my parent as a flawed and real person with their own demons. As someone who tried as hard as they could despite knowing that they were not a prefect parent. Despite that understanding, I still strongly feel that a single-parent child has a massively worse chance of developing a mental illness than does one with BP affected parents. 

 As an adult, my own partner was not very strong emotionally and was eventually unable to support me at all during my struggles. I already had had deep misgivings about her ability to be a mother,which is a hard moment of realization right there.  After that realization, I then doubted my own ability to be 'present' for my child as much as would be needed by them. I consciously decided not to have children mostly to break the cycles of abuse that defined my childhood. I do sometimes regret my decision, but without a steady co-parent or extended family support I think I made the right choice for me and my possible child. It is one of the more complicated and uneasy parts of my adult life. I think it over more than I should.

It sounds like you are in a far better position to be a parent than I was, regardless of your mental health. I don't think there is a 'right' or 'wrong' answer here.  Some statistical likelihood of hereditary mental illness does seem to exist but AFAIK it is poorly understood and not necessarily indicative of anything (is it causation or correlation? Or both? ).  I put forth the belief that in regards to children's mental health, the environment plays a larger part in children's emotional development than the genetics.  I suggest that you consider the following thoughts and see what your heart and your partner says:

Are you confident in your partner's ability to help both you and a child simultaneously?

Have you and your partner (and maybe a third party like a counselor) discussed the specific ways he might need to carry the household and support you and the child when things are rough?

Will your child have a physical space that feels safe for them to be in when you are feeling volatile?

Will you have a space away from your child to be volatile in for yourself?

Can you commit to maintaining your own mental health through things that do not involve your child? By this I mean out-of-the-house activities, socialization of some type, hobbies etc.

Do you have any difficulty setting and maintaining boundaries due to your illness? Children will absolutely test your boundaries regularly.

When they become mature enough, are you ready to be vulnerable, open, and honest with your child about your mental health struggles?

And for me, the big BIG question:

\*\*\*Are you ready to do whatever it takes to be reliably available to your child emotionally, without pressuring or smothering them due to your own fears and insecurities?\*\*\*

&#x200B;

The fact that you are having this discussion and doing the self-examination of your feelings puts you years ahead of many would-be or accidental parents, and is commendable. That alone gives me confidence that you absolutely could be an effective and loving parent."
bipolar,fdh2imk,t3_ektrp3,1578413977.0,"Awareness and understanding usually come from experience. Most have none with BP.

When I am hypomanic I regularly get the urge to start a 401c non-profit educational/awareness organization for BP.  I think this is badly needed, but I am doubtful that I could do it.

bipolar,fdh0wig,t1_fdew9x1,1578412960.0,"This. So much this.  I am also fairly high functioning for BP2. Employed at decent jobs 90% of the time, financially self-sufficient (so far...), I can normally maintain good hygiene, fitness, and decorum. When I was able to better regulate my emotions I could do things like get good grades and be captain of my high school track team, get a scholarship to a prestigious university, work on a mechanical engineering degree, hold jobs for more than 2 years, take on managing projects at work, have healthy relationships.  When I am hypo manic, everyone loves me, I can reliably be the tide that raises others up with me. So I look good at arms length, most of the time.  People outright expect me to support them, not the other way around.

When the bottom drops out, though, it really drops out. And those around me just see my performance drop, and make statements such as ""There's nothing wrong with you or your environment, you just need to focus/try harder/get motivated/stop being lazy"". 
 
At many steps in my life, when I asked for help I have been told ""You're fine, stop complaining"".  This kind of dismissal is happening more frequently as I get older.  I don't have any constructive way to get around this aspect of our illness. When this type of dismissal happens I hear these lyrics in my head, leads to tears every time.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epgo8ixX6Wo (Massive Attack - Protection)

This girl I know needs some shelter, She don't believe anyone can help her.
She's doing so much harm, Doing so much damage.

But you don't want to get involved, You tell her she can manage.
And you can't change the way she feels, But you could put your arms around her.

AskReddit,fcpj4ap,t3_ei0sog,1577865546.0,"Best gift received - Baked Cake in a Box.  I had to spend my birthday alone this year, my family is 2000 miles away and everyone I know locally was working or had prior plans, etc, etc.  My 80 year old mom mailed me a fully baked and frosted chocolate cake inside a pyrex cake pan. Candles and cake topper were included. Amazingly, the cake arrived nearly perfect and not damaged as one would expect. Aside from singing Happy Birthday to myself, it was wonderful. The cake only lasted about 4 hours...

The worst gift I received was a small desk top pen-holder notepad-dispenser thingy, with an engraved message saying ""My forever friend"".  This was from someone very close to me that I had known for 5 years.  What makes this the worst gift was two-fold. First, the quality of the gift was awful. It was made from very cheap materials, and poorly put together. The small engraved plaque was already falling off of the front when I unwrapped this gift (not so forever, eh?).  For comparison, I took this person out for a nice dinner, and 3rd row seats at a Cirque de Soleil show.  

Second, only three days after giving me this gift calling me a forever friend, this person did something that broke so many pre-agreed upon boundaries that I had to summarily drop them from my life and was forced to consider legal action. ""Forever Friend"" my ass.

But the cake was good."

This past summer was much worse, I took my siblings on an expensive vacation and didn't tell them it was all on credit. Glad to have spent the time in the tropics with people I love, but the card statement physically hurt that month.

I heartily agree with FrontenacRacer, talk with your husband or maybe a financial advisor at your bank about other ways of handling money. Perhaps a secured credit card with a lower limit for you to use day to day?  Also, Amazon is the devil for impulse shoppers. I use tricks like never buying anything the first time I put it in my basket, never spending more than 5-10 minutes at a time browsing their site, and not having a Prime account. You could even blacklist Amazon from your PC login and phone, and only access it when you husband logs in with his user account.

About the loneliness and the cold feeling of not having a physical connection with somebody, holy crap do I hear you. I have days where I can do naught but cry myself out while wishing someone would just hold me and let me feel safe for a little bit.  I daydream a LOT about receiving and giving affection right now.  Its been a long while since i have received any actual physical affection. My cat helps, but it isn't a substitute for real affection. I had a coworker give me a platonic but very close hug a few months ago and I almost cried right there. It's hard, but I have to remind myself that I have a lot of self-work to do and may not be ready for a partner yet. 

It sounds like you might need to work on establishing and maintaining boundaries with friends and family so that they don't burn you out. This is probably something best pursued with a therapist. Is therapy an option for you right now?

Remember, the meds rarely take away all of our symptoms. Or the effectiveness waxes and wanes over time and with other triggers added. I still become sad and depressed despite my anti-depressants, just not as badly as without the meds.

Please have a long warm hug from me. I won't lie and tell you cheerful stories, but know that you are not alone. You are stronger than you think."
bipolar,f9x67sz,t3_e79m3j,1575705425.0,"I tried to re-frame what life goals meant to me. Are they demands to be met? Or are they a helpful friend that reminds you of what you might achieve? When I viewed things as 'I MUST do this or I am a failure', well, then I was a failure a lot. And that really feeds the depressive episodes. 

I also worked on disassociating my personal idea of success from the idea of professional success. I am happy that I made it to the gym today, success! I didn't get a big promotion, ah well that's not really a failure is it?

I now set smaller goals for each day, and the coming week if I feel stable. This way I get a sense of accomplishment from doing laundry or dishes for example, instead of failing to achieve a goal like getting a masters degree in xenobiology.  Long term goals are there but not on my shoulder all day, so to speak.  Do I worry about my financial and emotional future? Damn right I do! But the smaller goals help keep me from ruminating on past and future failures. And as much as I personally detest doing it, journaling your daily feelings and thoughts about success/failure seems to help many folks keep the thoughts from swirling around in our heads.

My biggest ongoing success is learning to fail gracefully instead of failing like a nuclear reactor meltdown, if that makes sense."

Please please please try to limit or moderate your drinking, especially at your age (effects of heavy alcohol use on developing teenage brains can have bad long term effects).  Plus the meds make your liver work harder, and adding large amounts of alcohol to the mix could literally take years off of your life due to jaundice or liver damage.  I still get cravings for certain things, but force myself to recall the suffering that comes after a relapse every time.

BipolarReddit,f9x19sj,t3_e6dgtu,1575702820.0,"I am in the gym 2-3 times a week, usually 40-60 min of cardio and 60 min of weightlifting. I use this as one of my main aggro dumps, channeling the rage into the weights. Just have to watch that I don't overdo it and injure myself (i don't seem to always believe I have physical limits when in an elevated state). 

For SD/martial arts, I chose Tai-Chi Chaun in order to explore better muscle control and breathing rather than training myself to use rage to strike. Losing control and using my skills to hurt someone in anger has been a fear of mine for a long time.

If you are looking for more seriously physical disciplines, consider Jujitsu or Krav Maga.  Both feature strong bursts of effort as part of the style, and intensity is usually expected in these disciplines. I personally cannot recommend boxing due to the chance of head blows while in the ring, I already have 7 concussions to my name."
BipolarReddit,f9wzdsy,t3_e6j8e8,1575701762.0,"I started lamotrigine at 50mg, and slowly moved up to 200mg over a period of 4 months. There were some noticeable side effects while I was titrating up to 200mg, such as vision blurriness and light sensitivity. I also experienced temporary moderate to severe memory and cognitive issues, but these cleared up about 3-4 weeks after the 200mg dosage was reached. I saw no direct correlation between the lamotrigine and my anxiety.  My irritability levels seem unaffected by the lamotrigine, good or bad. However, on lamotrigine my emotions are generally more stable, with an easier return to baseline after shit goes down. 

The single biggest action that has reduced my irritability was giving up caffeine. Even small amounts of it cause me serious problems for a few days afterwards, while my body is screaming for more coffee like an addict.  I miss coffee, a lot.

Possibly log your irritability, cross referenced with your dosage increases? That might help show a pattern of correlation if one is there. I do think it is an unlikely conclusion, but I am not a doctor! 

Remember, even if you currently feel you are an irritable bitch, we still care about you. Good luck and stay strong."
bipolar,f9qrx5w,t3_e6iki9,1575566000.0,"I used to be a do-it-all office and logistics guy for small businesses. Lots of customer and management interaction, usually under deadlines. Project management responsibility and full accountability for projects. It used to be something I excelled at until my episodes got out of hand.   

Now I look for jobs that involve smaller teams, much less customer interaction, and a single point of contact with upper management.  If it is outdoors work then it is even better.  Sadly, aside from drafting and 3d modelling, I don't have the education or experience to secure most work from home jobs. Right now I am working with a railroad doing low level but decent paying physical work loading semis out of railcars. Clear goals, work ends at end of shift, and I am pretty much left alone 90% of the time. Only drawbacks are the physical nature of the work, and the formal need to declare all of my meds to my direct supervisor (federal requirement for railroads). 

Things I no longer even consider in jobs:
- companies with high turnover, this is almost always a bad environment for us 
- positions that answer to more than one person
- high levels of accountability for other team members
- businesses run by people from sales backgrounds or that are run by owner/ceo/entrepreneur types, seems to lead to high pressure work environments
- high volume manufacturing work, this was super stressful and expectations constantly change or increase unrealistically

I look at job listings for things like surveyors, technical consultants,  and skilled labor.  Jobs that have a certain level of interaction but not constant 'available by phone/text/email' levels.

Since you are in education, have you considered private tutoring? School counselor sounds like another fulfilling position if you can handle hearing the kids problems on the regular.

Good luck!"

Barring actual acceptance and support, it seems like the best we can hope for is respectful communication of why our behaviors are problematic.  I try to focus on what made them good people in the first place, forgive those that were respectful, and to hell with those that straight up ghosted or invalidated. Doesn't always work, but it helps me keep perspective. Still hurts like hell but it easily beats the constant resentment and self-criticism."

I was also going through the first round of post-diagnosis med changes just after losing a good job and my girlfriend due to my symptoms. It was a hard winter, as yours is sounding like.

I took up new things, even if I didn't feel like it.  I taught myself to bake bread and to make pickles, I did small re-arrangement  and cleaning projects around the house. I scheduled play/exercise time for my cat.  I forced myself to contact people in my life occasionally, even if it meant taking a sedative to be able to do it. I focused on limiting my electronic screen time, and reading books instead. I forced myself to leave the house at least every other day, even if it was just to go to the library or to a pool hall or bowling alley or the supermarket. I eventually pushed myself to get a gym membership, and to use it regularly.  I allowed myself to cry whenever it felt needed, but made sure I didn't let myself wallow in my sadness for more than a day or so. I made promises to my cat, my mom, and to my sibling that required me to be around to fulfill those promises. I set tasks in my calendar for regular things like grocery shopping or a haircut or house cleaning so I had tasks to do in the near future. I read a hell of a lot about the bipolar condition so I could name my demon and face him on my feet. Knowledge is power!

Friend, it is not time for you to punch your ticket. Notice those dark  thoughts as they bubble up in your mind, acknowledge them, then call them out for the bullshit they are.

He is now my best friend, and my promise to him to care for him and keep him safe is one of my primary motivators when things get bad. He is reliant on me, and that is something I am unable to ignore. This helps get me out my own head sometimes.

Plus, since I tend to self-isolate, a furry companion can be a godsend on the really bad days. His affection is truly priceless to me. And having someone, anyone, to greet me when I get home has helped my daily depressive crash when I get home after work.

My only suggestion is to possibly arrange a back up person ahead of time to help care for the little guy if things get really rough for you.

However, I did once take a version of the Myers-Briggs test with an interesting result.  I was described as a 'Technical Bridge"". Really just means I was good at building understanding, communication,  and cross-discipline plans between disparate units in a business environment.

It may feel like you are giving up responsibility, but you are actually making sure that your dad has the professional care he needs. Being an adult often sucks like this, but sadly that's part of the gig.

Yes, it hurts. Yes, you are likely to question this decision multiple times. Yes, there will be tears and possibly sleepless nights. But there are times when the only answer available to you is less than ideal. This is not a reason to blame yourself. Remember that you cared enough to offer to take him in. You cared enough to seek a different answer. You cared enough to shed tears for this man.  Many children would never consider that level of comitment or sacrifice for their parents.

Remind yourself as needed that you do care, that your are connected, that you are making an effort, and that this is NOT YOUR FAULT.  If it becomes a constant weight on you, please seek out community support groups for caregivers. Here are a few links to help you with that search:
