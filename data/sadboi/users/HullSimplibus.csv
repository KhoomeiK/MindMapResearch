confessions,fqutpnw,t3_gkt053,1589664428.0,"Hey, i'm sorry that you went through this.

I understand how you feel completely. I'm 16 and my parents didn't have the best of relationships and would fight pretty often. I remember they split up when I was like 3 and my dad would come over drunk and they would start fighting, and i'd end up being dragged into it. Eventually, my dad managed to overcome the drink problem, but still the fights and showdowns that he had with my mum that I sometimes got dragged into have stuck with me.

As another comment stated, you don't have to forgive him. If you do, by all means, thats ok. But it's completely up to you.

Honestly though, if the anxiety is truly affecting you when you are around him, it is maybe best to see a therapist about it, or, more drastically, cut him out. But I understand it's hard to do either, particularly the last one with a close family member. Either way, don't let it eat away at you. When anxiety does that, it's terrible in the long run."
SuicideWatch,fqup7d2,t1_fqtvk2u,1589662455.0,"Wow dude, the part near the beginning hits home. I swear I have been a target for judgement for ages and my parents split up when I was 3 and even when my dad used to come over to see me they used to fight. I vaguely remember my dad's anger eventually radiated to me and I faced quite a bit of mental abuse from him up until I was around maybe 12. The sad thing with me is i've never truly had a gf. I have, but it was only the platonic friendly type of thing you have when you are 10/11/12. And same here. Any 'friend' I have ever known never talks to me first. Basically, I end up hanging on to a friend because the others have left me and then eventually I end up totally alone. Just gonna add at the end, sorry you had to go through so much shit, too.

Honestly, I have began blocking out any toxic opinion about me, whether it be about my weight, looks, unusual hobbies e.t.c. If it's constructive criticism I just try to analyze whether taking it would be beneficial e.t.c. Maybe finding new hobbies is a good idea though, I tried guitar once lol but I just didn't have the patience. Keyboard/piano looks pretty therapeutic though. Funnily enough programming is another one I tried too üòÇ I remember I went through a period of messing around with simple Lua scripts in ROBLOX. Was pretty fun and made some cool stuff.

I think the main two would be writing and singing. I want to sing and even at one point I recalled wanting to act but I just don't have the confidence for either. I think my voice sounds horrible. And i'm frightened to hear it because of that so it's hard to better it. But gotta say, good luck with that basketball dunküëçüëç My main motivation at the moment is pretty big. Being from the UK, I REALLY want to visit the US some day, or even go to live. The idea of visiting or living in another country seems amazing to me. But there is the ladder leading up to that which is full of stuff and hard to climb as it is, so I guess I ain't too confident about that either.

Yeah, same and still can't. I go through periods of looking for a girlfriend and then go through periods of waiting for one to come to me. That's how I tend to keep myself partially sane all the while at the same time beating myself down for not being able to properly talk to girls.

Yeah I know, it seems like I have a pretty well constructed way of dealing with things in some ways, but unfortunately my mental health is truly down the shitter.

I think that's why we try to find enjoyment, because life is really short and pointless. And if we can't, it just seems best to end it early. Honestly if it wasn't for my mum, my younger brother e.t.c. I think i'd have probably done it. To them, i'm a big loss. Another thought I had is how much of a waste it'd be of young life.

It's ok lol haha I am a man, a very depressed young one at that. But I gotta say your comment did help me quite a bit. It has helped me see that there is much more to do with your life, it's just getting up and doing it. Maybe that's gradual. But honestly thanks dude/ma'am (I ain't gonna assume eitherüòÇ) I appreciate itüëç"

As for wanting to be white, it's ok to feel that way. Just know there is nothing wrong with you for being Latino, and even if you aren't white you should be valued at the same level as someone who is.

Also, not to make myself out the be the victim, (i'm not), it seems like white people as a whole can face racial prejudice nowadays. Like, for example, people have the idea if you make a malicious comment based on a white person's skin colour, it isn't racist. Which has always lead me to think white people can be seen as lower beings so being separatist towards them isn't racist. Which, is actually, very racist. Another perfect example is how you have been ridiculed for wanting to adopt certain aspects of white American culture, and people have been like 'Omg that's so white', as if white is a bad thing or something. It's literally right under everyone's noses and accepted into western society.

Well, as irrelevant as that last part seemed, it's just because I have faced a similar thing before, e.g. wanting to have darker skin e.t.c, so I know how you feel. I just have slowly learnt to accept being white is apart of who I am and I do not need to be ashamed or feel bad about it, as it would be 100% acceptable for you to feel about being Latino."
