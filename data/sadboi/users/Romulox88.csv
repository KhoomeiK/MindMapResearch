Me too and He's by far my favorite player of all-time. His intensity and skill level were so high but I wouldn't put him in the list with those elite legends. He's in the next bracket for me. Big O and the logo rank higher for me I agree with OP.

My list in order:

Tier 1

MJ (GOAT)

Bron+

Wilt

Kareem

Tier 2

Magic

Shaq

Russell

Bird

Duncan

Hakeem

Big O

Kobes

Logo

Tier 3

Mail man

Zeke (toughest player ever at 6'1)

Dirk

McHale

Dr.

Chuck

KG

Moses

Steph+ (Time will tell Steph vs KD)

KD+ (Time will tell KD vs Steph)

Pippen

Stockton

Tier 4

Russ+ (interchangeable with Harden)

Harden+ (interchangeable with Westbrook)

Robinson

Baylor

CP3+/D-wade/Iverson (couldn't pick call them tied for 30th)

\+ designates still active with potential to move up the list

16-21 was very hard to rank, some of the best PF's off all time that group is pretty interchangeable depending on era and preference. There's a clear #1 PF and #2 but then a bunch of guys who could be the 3rd best that's just my take.

I have Steph ahead of KD right now but if KD can win somewhere else that could easily change."
