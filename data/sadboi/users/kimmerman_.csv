mildlyinfuriating,fockh4v,t3_g6kfyk,1587672392.0,I’m more infuriated that this person misspelled “volume” with the correct spelling right in front of him.
typewriters,fnz8rf7,t3_g4qmru,1587388893.0,Staples sells relatively inexpensive cotton-based paper (and envelopes if you’re mailing letters).
Patriots,fnz6gpk,t1_fnz6cbf,1587387302.0,"Ah, I see that now. They’re a little bolder?"
Patriots,fnz3oat,t1_fnz3a9y,1587385159.0,"Well, considering they didn’t change the helmet color and the numbers are the same as far as I can tell, yes it’s subtle. I suppose the only thing that isn’t subtle is the change to blue pants for the home look, as opposed to blue on silver."
Patriots,fnz2iuf,t3_g4rj77,1587384188.0,Well they didn’t lie - it’s a subtle change. I for one am happy to see a new look post-Brady.

typewriters,fnuk48w,t1_fntx5ow,1587264010.0,"According to the box, it’s resume paper from staples. A little heavier and nicer feeling than the standard printer variety, and I believe it is cotton."

dogs,fle79rp,t1_fle3v57,1585078919.0,Yikes! So something hard maybe? Something they couldn’t pull through the crate?
dogs,fle1mqi,t1_fle16m4,1585075893.0,Yeah she has no problem if we’re leaving. Sometimes she’ll even put herself in there if she can see we’re leaving and haven’t gotten her leash to have her come with us. I think she’s just not sure what to do because she knows we’re home.
dogs,fle1d5r,t1_fldzch9,1585075747.0,"We’ve been trying to leave her and she will sometimes quiet down. And she often goes in there on her own for bed time at night. I think she really just is unsure of what to do knowing that we’re home.

Edit to say it’s a wire crate. Maybe putting a blanket over it would help her feel more at ease."
dogs,fldyrlv,t3_fo8jo1,1585074333.0,"My dog (1.5 yo, adopted 3 months ago) had been going in her crate while my wife and I worked during the day, but now is with us as we work from home. We’ve tried crating her but she barks as she knows we’re still in the house. Should we still try to crate her and let her bark until she calms down?"

depression,ffxhh5b,t1_ffx9gns,1580325240.0,That is helpful. Getting on an exercise routine has been incredibly hard for me and I don’t know why. But I’m gonna go to the gym tonight and look into vitamins!
dogs,ffx3xu6,t1_ffwyjiq,1580317229.0,"This is so helpful, thank you. I’ve been thinking some one-on-one training may benefit her and us. This is my first dog, and my wife’s first since having one as a kid - though she was more involved in the training."

The person I’d be reaching out to is currently in the role I’m applying for (I can’t tell if I’d be replacing them or joining them). The school uses a large hiring program for applications, so I’m not sure if reaching out to HR would get me anywhere. Essentially I’m looking to get my name out there beyond just my application."

Patriots,fa8qpfa,t1_fa8qbb8,1575852407.0,And why not let the fumble recovery play out so they can automatically review the turnover? Either way it’s a TD for the Pats the refs blatantly took off the board.
dogs,f9i06ez,t1_f9hlsdf,1575325219.0,Thank you again. All good advice.

Coldplay,f4pqr6y,t3_dlcpxe,1571740739.0,That’s gotta be Will.
Coldplay,f4pqmpy,t1_f4pi18k,1571740656.0,That and the fact that Coldplay have never had an album with their images on the cover. It’s too similar to AHFOD to be real if you ask me.

It wasn’t long before I was going through their older albums and falling in love with songs that I hadn’t heard. They’re now my favorite band without a doubt and I think Strawberry Swing remains my personal favorite track (and music video) from this masterpiece.

Edit: Strawberry Swing, not Strawberry Field 🙃"
