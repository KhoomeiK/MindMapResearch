I think PTA jobs are harder to find and I've heard PT is also saturated. My friend obtained a PTA job after applying for a few months where I live. I am unsure about the stability of PT but I know PT will always be in need. I was thinking about going the PT but I've read that you need a PTD (doctorate's degree) which turned me off completely. I've also seen some YouTube videos about PT's being laid off as well due to Covid-19. You could check the PT subreddit and see how they're doing.

I'm not even sure if OT is a good field to get into either but it may be better to get into than being a COTA, considering you're still in high school. The previous post regarding PDGM was implemented last October (2019) and has slashed home health services and I'm sure other OT settings as well.

I'd say keep OT in mind while you're going through your undergraduate degree and keep an eye out on the job opportunities in your area or areas where you are willing to relocate to. It may take a while for the OT field to ""bounce back"" especially after Covid-19. Hope this helps."

I attempted to apply to OT school right after I graduated from undergrad and I didn't get in on my first try. I decided to work and ended up working two part time jobs, one of them being with children. I believe having both of my jobs improved my social skills and allowed me to discover work/life balance. I used my experience of working with children to my advantage, the 2nd time I applied (through my personal statement and interview) and got in.

COVID19positive,fl9ee7v,t3_fnc1ok,1584951876.0,"Hey there.

I haven't tested positive but have had some difficulty breathing and had a burning sensation around the middle of my chest (lower sternum) for 2 days. I've also had a sore throat/running nose and a cough throughout the week.

Here are some of the things I've been doing:
I've been journeling/monitoring my symptoms each day. Sometimes I'll write things down multiple times a day, just in case if things get bad and I need to go to the ER, I'll have a detailed description of my symptoms.

I've encouraged my parents to wash their hands more so while I isolate myself in my room. I also use a separate bathroom.

If I do leave my room I make sure to wash my hands for at least 20 seconds EVERY TIME. I also disinfect things that I've touched (light switches, doorknobs, table surfaces, sink handles, etc.). 

I started to wear a mask around my family members while practicing social distancing in the home (if I leave my room). I have thought about wearing gloves as well (washing hands before putting them on and after taking them off). Wearing gloves wouldn't hurt if you have them.

When it comes to food, I think the best thing to do is to have someone bring the food to your door/space and then leave it at your door. Then you pick up the food and eat it in your room or confined space. I think this limits interaction between an infected and a non-infected individual.

I've avoided touching and holding my cat since I don't know how long the virus can live on fur. My cat is quite social and loves to spend time with my mom and I. I keep him out of my room as well.

Re: wearing shoes in the home. I have heard from the news (CNN) that it's more difficult for viruses to transfer via your feet since they're near the ground and they're not usually in contact with our hands and face. 

Re: Clorox wipes. I can't say if they'll completely kill the virus, but continue to use them, along with isopropyl alcohol wipes (if you have any).

If I need to talk to my parents or want some social interaction with them, I call them on my phone or FaceTime even when we're all in the home.

Hope this helps."

COVID19positive,fl3n3xo,t3_fldv2s,1584791488.0,"Hello all,

I believe I may have contracted Covid-19. I am in my late 20s and female. I have been trackingy symptoms but what happened today really made me worried. It started off with a sore throat and runny nose the first day (March 14th). The next day, I had a light cough. I've had a light cough all week until the night of March 20th.

I fell asleep on the couch for 3 hours because I was feeling tired. I woke up and within an hour, I started feeling a heaviness in my chest coupled with shortness of breath and some coughing.

I do not have a fever or any aches. I did feel extremely cold though and my body temp was 94.6 despite being under a blanket, in a sweater, slippers, and long pj pants.

I decided to go to the bathroom. I did my business and walked back to the couch and felt out of breath. Within the hour, I tried going up 1 flight of stairs and after that, the middle lower part of my chest (bottom of the sternum area) started burning and I still had shortness of breath. Mind you, before this, I had been doing cardio 3x per week  and going up the stairs was a breeze just a few days ago.

I notified my parents and now I'm in bed, hoping that I haven't infected them. I've been home with both of them all week but we've been practicing social distancing, washing our hands, etc.

I'm scared for them more so than me, and this chest pain/burning feeling isn't all that great. Has anyone else experienced this?

EDIT (March 21st): I now have a burning sensation in the middle of my chest that comes and goes every 10-20 minutes. Currently in quarantine in my room away from my family. Deep breathing is still a little difficult but not as bad as last night.

If I were to rate my symptoms from 1-10. 

Chest pain/burning: 3 right now. Last night it was a 5.

Difficulty breathing: 2 right now. Last night was a 4-5."

First of all, you're not selfish or complaining about this. You're expressing your concerns about your current situation which is 110% valid. I recently got out of my chronic depressive state (2 years) just a couple months ago. I know you have plenty of support here but I also wanted to lend you some techniques that have helped me.

I made a ""Feel Good/Motivational"" scale starting from 1 to 10. I rate each number by how I was feeling in the moment that I checked in with myself. 1 being in complete and utter crisis, and 10 being, I'm feeling like I can conquer anything. I checked in with myself every day, multiple times a day, and if I was anywhere under the 5, I would list activities that I could do that would push me up to a 7 or even an 8. And some days, I stayed at a 5 or lower and that was okay too. But, I tried to always push myself to at least 1 number higher on the scale, at least once per day.

I know routine is also crucial when trying to get out of depression. Another thing that helped me was preparing a set of clothes at night, to be changed into and worn the next day (even if I wasn't leaving the house). It helped me dress myself for that day and also helped with productivity levels. You can also establish waking up and going to bed at the same time or an activity rotation schedule as well to keep you on a routine.

I don't know if these tips will help at all but I wanted to let you know that I hear you. We hear you and we're here for you. You are stronger than your depression."

Also, if you find that Prozac makes you more awake, take it in the morning. If you find that it makes you drowsy, take it at night. It takes 2-4 weeks to adjust to the side effects and 6-8 weeks to feel the full benefits. If you're upping your dosage for whatever reason, be aware that the side effects may return (just not as bad as the first time around). Never stop taking it without consulting with your doctor, and don't be afraid of taking it because it truly does wonders for some. Hope all goes well!

The thing that sucks is that it takes 2-3 weeks for most people to feel the positive effects (stability, ability to handle stress easier, motivation, energy, etc.). And during those 2-3 weeks, there are quite a few side effects, but everyone reacts differently and experiences different side effects.

Just wanted to let you know that yes, what you are experiencing is normal. The stresses of college and the energy it takes to go study, go to classes, manage your social life, and take care of yourself, can take a toll on the mind. If you can, take a break from studying and do something that makes you feel good. Do something that you enjoy. This break could be a 5 minute break, or an hour break, depending on what your schedule is and how much of a time crunch you have. 

Remember, these are only thoughts. Yes, they can be debilitating, but it's good to get distract your mind on something else.

infp,fbgzrwk,t3_ed6lkd,1576862327.0,I love it! I feel relaxed when I look at it.
cats,fbgzifg,t3_ed4z2o,1576862153.0,This put a genuine smile on my face. I also have a little fur baby and he's the best thing. He helped and continues to help me with my anxiety and depression. He's a true companion! I'm happy to know that your new cat is helping you out as well.
prozac,fbgyv1h,t3_ecz7f7,1576861723.0,You could talk to your doctor and ask them to prescribe you a lower dose to start out with so the side effects aren't as harsh. My doc started me on 10mg and worked me up to 20mg. I was on 10mg for 2.5 months until I noticed that it wasn't working anymore. 20mg is considered the therapeutic dose as well. It usually takes 3 to 4 weeks for the side effects to diminish and for the feeling of stability to take effect.
prozac,fb8cr15,t1_fb885i0,1576611085.0,I hope so too. We got this.

prozac,faenfon,t3_e8pk32,1576004281.0,"I am on 10mg of Prozac. When I first started, I remember the side effects lasting for about 2 weeks and then they subsided. I've heard that it usually takes about 4-6 weeks for the full effects of the medication to work. If you can, try to ride it out for the next couple weeks. If not, talk to your doctor and tell them what's been going on.

One thing that helped me when I was experiencing the side effects was keeping a journal and taking notes of the side effects each day so I can see how they changed over time.

You can message me if you'd like too! I'm here to chat if you need. Hope the side effects subside soon."
prozac,f8qtf96,t3_e1i8d4,1574723784.0,"You are simply incredible. I'm so glad to hear that Prozac has helped you! You've listed some things that you still need to accomplish but you've come so far from where you were and I wanted to remind you of that. Such an accomplishment! Going through life and battling with depression, along with other external stresses, makes it really tough. But, you've made it and you're continuing to make it! Happy that you're here. üòä"
prozac,f8lia8v,t3_e0xigy,1574622432.0,"When I started prozac, I also experience this. I was grinding my teeth for a month, which then caused headaches. I tried some jaw massages to relieve the pain but eventually I temporarily stopped taking prozac (please do not do this unless you talk to your doctor first) because it was THAT bothersome. It definitely stopped but the depressive symptoms came rolling back. I got back on my 10mg dose about 2 months ago and the teeth grinding subsided. I still catch myself grinding from time to time but it's not as bad as it was before."
