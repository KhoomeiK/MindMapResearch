If you don't want to be in the program, I guess it's worth a try to convince your mum not to be part of it.
All I can say, however, is patience. You said you're going to school for programming - maybe you can be old enough to get your degree or diploma (I've got no idea what the systems like in the US), get a job and ditch your step-dad, whilst supporting your sister and mum (they could live with you?). Programming projects pay well as there's quite a lot of demand for it, or so I've heard.
I wish you the best and that I could help more and hope things turn out well for you, your mother and sister - just be patient, and things will turn out the way you may want it to be."

Personally i do agree with your conclusion, i think ERYS is Jaden's facade for hiding his true emotions or it could probably suggest that Jaden's sortaa bipolar? I think that because of the way how a lot of the tracks talk about acting all ""tough"" and ""bad boy"" or whatever but in one way or another, most of the tracks do link back to the breakup, 

Such as K in PINK, a bit of NOIZE because of the chorus ( 'Tell me you're sorry, I feel the same)',

 i-drip-or-is when he says ""it ain't 2017, I'm done with all the crying"" at the end,

 Again at the end,

 Fire Dept at the end,

 Summertime in Paris and Blackout really explain it for themselves,

Pain at the end,

Riot at the end,

ERYS at the end,

These tracks in the ERYS album have something in common; they always reveal something emotional and it's pretty much always about the girl or the breakup almost always mentioned **at the end of the song**. This shows that no matter how much Jaden tries to keep that ERYS facade, SYRE always comes back, almost in a bipolar sort of way because of how up and down the mood goes in each track, all to be looped again and again. The reason that I think its looped is because of the sun rising in the track ERYS and SYRE emerging ('Damn, it's that n\*gga SYRE again). I also think that VISION drug you were talking about? It sounds a lot like lean but I doubt you could 'smoke' lean so idk.

&#x200B;

Sooo in a nutshell I basically think Jaden's adopted this ERYS facade in a way to get over ""her"" but SYRE always get the better of ERYS, this could support your theory about EYRS fearing SYRE as he's too strong? But hey, that's just a theory-"
