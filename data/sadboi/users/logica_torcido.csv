lanadelrey,euh591a,t1_euh3j4e,1563821069.0,"Like why it has managed to stay on the charts for so many weeks? BTD managed pretty good sales numbers. When that album dropped, she was getting a ton of international coverage and doing a lot of TV appearances. The coverage wasn‚Äôt necessarily good but it got people talking and checking her out. Aside from that, I think BTD crafted a very unique sound that no one else was really doing at the time. The summertime sadness remix being a radio hit certainly helped generate interest as well. All that combined with her mysterious persona + conventionally attractive looks = big success. 
Nowadays, she doesn‚Äôt do TV and barely promotes any of her stuff, plus her newer sound is even less radio friendly than BTD was.  She still has a strong fan base but her stuff now tends to chart high and then drop off altogether within a few weeks. And I think that‚Äôs how she prefers it"
