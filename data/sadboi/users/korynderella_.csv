While I agree it‚Äôs gross, and people should to be respectful of their neighbors (quiet hours, dog poop, etc.) others aren‚Äôt like that, and you can‚Äôt assume people are going to act in a manner that you would. 

So, with that in mind, if he wants to loudly fart in HIS backyard-he has every right to."

A) your fianc√© is being a hypocrite. to me, an outsider, it seems she‚Äôs pissed she had you sign the prenup prior to the death of your father, and wants to renegotiate terms in the event of divorce. 

B) if she plans to be with you forever, why is she so concerned about this? she shady."

You can‚Äôt pick and choose whose deserves to have their grade bumped up-it‚Äôs unethical. It‚Äôs also kinda shitty that you don‚Äôt offer any extra credit-it‚Äôs high school sis. You‚Äôre dealing with children. If your best student can‚Äôt get more than an A-, then there‚Äôs something going on with your grading system or how the content was taught."

He sounds like a mega douche and wasn‚Äôt doing it with ‚Äúgood intentions‚Äù, especially if he knew that you were 6-months sober. (way to go, btw!!! Don‚Äôt let this d-bag take away what you‚Äôve accomplished.) clearly, your sister wanted you there and he should have respected that.

It‚Äôs not your responsibility to be carting around a pregnant woman that you don‚Äôt know. Have you been reimbursed for all the gas? Also, I‚Äôm just a bit curious about why the pregnant woman can‚Äôt drive herself? 

Is public transportation an option? If so, I would recommend to your mom, if she‚Äôs hell bent on helping her friend, to help pay for some kind of monthly pass so she doesn‚Äôt need to rely on anyone to get around."

If you‚Äôre 16 year old sister calls you to come get her from a party, it doesn‚Äôt matter if she‚Äôs drunk/high/or stone cold sober, you get your ass out of bed and go get her. She called YOU. She trusted YOU. She needed YOU. She needed you to be her older brother and have her damn back, but you were too concerned about losing some sleep instead of making sure your sister was safe?.

Glad she was smart enough to call someone and not get into a strangers car or behind the wheel herself-thank God we don‚Äôt have to know what would have happened then, right? But hey, at least you would have been able to have those extra 3 hours of sleep. 

You got some dick energy with small dick vibes bro."

Giving you the benefit of the doubt,your heart is in the right place-but you have gone about it in the wrong way. It‚Äôs unfortunate that your son made poor financial decisions, however it‚Äôs not your daughters job to clean up his mess.

I know she‚Äôs your mom but she‚Äôs kind of a dick? I feel bad saying that, but as someone who is religious, if it were my child I would be so grateful to God that He was able to give YOU the skills set to have a better life than she had/would have had without the hard work you‚Äôve done. Your mom seems very selfish and I‚Äôm really sorry that she isn‚Äôt showing the praise you deserve. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter why you didn‚Äôt bring her, she‚Äôs jealous. Don‚Äôt let her rain on your parade! You earned your vacation-enjoy if fam."
