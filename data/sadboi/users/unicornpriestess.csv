Knowledge is so powerful! I urge you to weaponize yourself with books by other survivors of sexual abuse. Ted talks or the moth are a short audio option if you aren‚Äôt into reading. It can be comforting to hear someone else experience the same things as you. Good luck! You are a queen, and amazing things will come from you!"
