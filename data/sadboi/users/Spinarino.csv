formula1,fomq5yo,t1_fompzkj,1587899819.0,Not really. Ricciardo kept his line and drove straight. Rosberg drove across him in an attempt to squeeze him out. That's not 50/50 at all.

formula1,fn9jcc9,t1_fn988th,1586775219.0,I am educated and I do race so I’m laughing at what you’ve just said. Leclerc was attempting to take a wider line but in doing that you need to leave a car’s width of space of another driver is alongside you. What’s so hard to understand about that???
formula1,fn723wp,t1_fn6nokg,1586711805.0,"Both of the incidents are apex/exit.  And I don't really think that Hamilton was fair in the USA incident and it should have been investigated. The Canada incident is a bit different and was more of a racing incident than anything else. 

But both still aren't similar to the Monza incident, which was blatently against the rules. You can't move across on another driver under braking. https://f1metrics.wordpress.com/2014/08/28/the-rules-of-racing/"
formula1,fn6iiyp,t1_fn6i504,1586700188.0,"He was still alongside... He had a significant portion of his car alongside Leclerc and was therefore entitled to space. ""Any driver defending his position on a straight, and before any braking area, may use the full width of the track during his first move, provided no significant portion of the car attempting to pass is alongside his."" 

I'm arguing with you because you don't understand racing and think it's fine to move in the braking zone and push someone off on the entry.... Read this: https://f1metrics.wordpress.com/2014/08/28/the-rules-of-racing/"
formula1,fn6hv9o,t1_fn6hrfa,1586699708.0,"How can I be wrong when Hamilton was objectively alongside Leclerc on the outside? It's not a debate whether he was or not, because the onboard clearly shows that he was....

It's been allowed but does that mean it should be legal? No. Which is why we're even having this discussion in the first place."
formula1,fn661m5,t1_fn5n7nf,1586688835.0,"Watch it again. Hamilton was alongside. Comparing Austria and Monza are useless as they're at completely different parts of the corner.

formula1,fn65ymu,t1_fn6345a,1586688740.0,Hamilton was still alongside and was entitled to room at that point. You can't just move over in the braking zone and expect Lewis to disappear at that point. The Austria decision was focussed on the exit of the corner and the Monza incident was on the entrance to the corner. What is so difficult to understand about that for you?
formula1,fn65urv,t1_fn5jvrj,1586688618.0,"""Entry to a corner"" 

Both of those videos are incidents on the exit of the corner. And anyway, Hamilton admitted that he was overly-aggressive in the USA incident, especially as the track was slippery. 

So once again, I'm going to ask: When has Hamilton forced another driver off on the entry to a corner just like Leclerc did in Monza?"

formula1,flh2mfn,t1_flh26g1,1585154938.0,What isn't possible? The problem with Paul Ricard is that mistakes aren't really punished and the track layout is crap anyway. Making the runoff gravel/grass instead would improve things a lot.

formula1,flgh9cl,t1_flg4t16,1585142520.0,"Hamilton was running behind Rosberg for the majority of the race and following him closely, meaning that his brakes overheated more than Rosberg's."
formula1,flgh00g,t1_flg7x8x,1585142341.0,Somewhat exciting? The racing was even worse than 2015 and the tyres melted after following cars for too long. The races were almost always decided by who got the better start from the two Merc drivers and it was never a fair fight because of how handicapped Hamilton was by car failures.

formula1,flggq69,t1_flgbkez,1585142154.0,"Schumacher was in his early 40's so was long past his peak. Lewis' reliability issues cost him the title in 2016. So yeah, Rosberg did beat both of them but that doesn't tell the full story."

formula1,flgebm5,t1_flge5rt,1585140363.0,Not really. Hamilton and Massa both were pretty inconsistent in 2008 and both made mistakes. Hamilton was far and above Rosberg in 2015 so it's really a valid comparison.

formula1,fjgmvfn,t1_fjgmhno,1583330895.0,"It's completely different. You're allowed to squeeze someone off if you're more than alongside on the inside on the exit of the corner, but squeezing another driver off on the entry to a corner has never been allowed.
