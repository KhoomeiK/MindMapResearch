running,fmr71jl,t3_fwvxot,1586315388.0,Hi there! I'm looking for a tool or an app that can help me plan my route. I'd like to do about 5km from my house and back. I know I could just walk 2.5km and turn back but I like to see different parts of the neighborhood! Anyone here know of an app where I can plan my own route before hand to see the distance? Thanks in advance!

mentalhealth,f6q734a,t3_dsl45n,1573072034.0,"It definitely sounds like one of your core beliefs is that you are ugly. Everyone is beautiful in their own way. I also see you're using absolute terms like ""always"" and ""forever"". Nothing is ever permanent, and everything is in a state of constant change. I don't think you will be alone forever.

I remind myself that I am important, and that I deserve the proper treatment and I deserve to be happy. I’d straight out tell him or her that you don’t think your meds are working and you’re interested in switching it up trying a new dose.

insomnia,f4ypk4p,t1_f4ypd46,1571882090.0,"Thank you for the comment. It’s definitely not something I want to stay in for a long period of time, as I have an addictive personality as it is. One thing I am trying to improve on is only using my bed for sleep so my body associates my bed with sleep. I do find myself reading or watching TV in bed a lot of the time so that is a goal for me to do those things elsewhere."
