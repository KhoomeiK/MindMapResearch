AskReddit,erp8f54,t1_erp49rc,1561104808.0,I really did try to keep you happy and I’m so sad I couldn’t. I tried my best and it wasn’t enough. You still got mad at me and constantly annoyed and it made me even sadder than I couldn’t help. I love you and I’ll always remember you. I’m sorry things didn’t work out.

BreakUps,eogv5b8,t3_bjk4pt,1558566432.0,He doesn't deserve you. You gave so much to him and he barely gave you scraps. You put in your effort to things because you care too much. And that's not a bad thing. It's good that you care but you have to care for the right people. He misused your care and took advantage of that. You deserve better because he doesn't deserve you.
