But the more time that passes I realize that I was never ‚Äúfixed‚Äù by the relationship. She was what I patched my depression with, and that‚Äôs never going to work, you need to fix yourself. That‚Äôs the only way you can really be whole. If you want someone else to fix your situation you‚Äôre only setting yourself up for failure as no one will every truly meet your expectations. Expectations will always lead to suffering because they create an illusion on control. Life‚Äôs crazy. You can‚Äôt control it, we must let go to truly be happy. A book that helped me

depression_help,fkvqwkv,t3_fkrylc,1584574845.0,"I battled severe depression for over 10 years before I caved in and saw a therapist. We had one meeting and the guy was a twat. 8 months later I tried again as a total last resort. It was a perfect match and the guy got me on some meds, I was very reluctant but figured if suicide was my other option then I had nothing to lose. It‚Äôs been 18 months since then and easily the best 18 months of my adult life. My biggest regret is not getting help earlier. Get help, it might be the best thing you ever do for yourself"

NoStupidQuestions,f52psr3,t3_dmbpw9,1571952298.0,"A lot of really miserable people in this thread. Yeah it would be great to have more days off or a little extra cash but life is a lot more than ‚Äújust getting through it‚Äù or ‚Äúliving for the weekend‚Äù. I think a key here is finding out what makes you feel so drained afterwork and figure out what will make you rebound quicker when you get home. examine yourself, get curious. What makes you feel good? What makes you feel bad? Fine tune your habits to give you more energy and thus more freetime. A lot of people spend an hour or two on reddit or social media after work just to ‚Äúdecompress‚Äù. Figure out your priorities ans cut out all the bullshit that doesnt add value to your life. No everyday of your life is t going to be an adventure but life is what you make it. Personally, exercise and meditation is what keeps my mind clear after an exhausting day. Grt after it! Good luck!"

depression,ewbq69m,t1_ewbn9n1,1565270627.0,Your ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù is not a static stagnant pool made up exclusively of depressed people. Depression in many is very dynamic and ever changing. If someone is doing well its ignorant to think they are different from you and have forgotten how miserable and agonizing to be in the throws of depression. Ive had luck with medication recently but that doesnt mean i dont live in constant vigilance to keep my head above water. Best of luck going forward i hope things improve for you.

We had a ton of common background (even when being 500 miles away we happened to go to the same high school). Tho i believe he was far from the best therapist out there he was the perfect way for me to get started and helped me tremendously. Keep at it, youll find someone"
