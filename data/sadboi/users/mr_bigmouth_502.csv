The really twisted part is that MindGeek, the company that owns PornHub and a huge number of other popular porn sites, also owns a number of big name porn studios. Content from these studios often gets posted, so MindGeek rakes in the advertising profits, while the porn actors make almost nothing. 

Now, I will admit, I do pirate a lot of stuff, mainly music, movies, and games. I'm not proud of it, but it is something I find myself doing. When it comes to porn, I have more of a problem with that being pirated than other stuff, because of what ends up happening to the actors."

Nowadays, I try to stick to furry porn and hentai. People might think they're ""weird"", but at least they don't depict real people being raped and exploited.

If you don't feel like dusting off an old PS2, the original three games are available in a collection on PS3. Even though they were originally rated ""Teen"" on the PS2, the collection is rated ""E10"" and as far as I know doesn't censor anything, so that pretty much means the PS2 versions would be just fine as well.

If you have more than one computer, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault is an insanely fun LAN game that can run on nearly any PC, and even though it's a WWII themed FPS, it's bloodless and fairly tame compared to modern games.
