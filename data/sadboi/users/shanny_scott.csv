Anxiety,f987haw,t3_e41ic8,1575174846.0,This isn’t a regular thing for me but it did happen one semester of college.  Coffee made my heart race and hands shake a lot more than in a normal moment of anxiety. It also felt like it made me spiral in my thoughts more. Even if the anxiety came on hours after the cup of coffee.  I still drink caffeine but try to limit it when I’m having rough weeks.

sex,f6wc3vx,t3_dtd7xr,1573222851.0,The same thing was happening to me (20F). I would have a UTI within 3 days every time I had sex. It got so bad I got a kidney infection and have permanent scar tissue in my bladder. This got serious for me very quickly. BUT I have since spoken to my doctor and gyno. They prescribed me an antibiotic to take “with activity” i.e. sex. It has helped a ton. My partner and I have also adopted new habitats. I always pee right after. We always use a condom. We often shower together to make sure we are both clean. He washes his hands before we start foreplay and I mean ALWAYS. In addition to all of these I have had to make lifestyle changes. I drink far less caffeine as it shakes the bladder. I no longer drink alcohol. All of these have improved my situation and my sexual experience.

Anxiety,f6v2fky,t3_dt7as5,1573174829.0,"Last night I had the longest panic attack about a very similar situation in my relationship. I so often struggle with what is reality and what is my anxiety. The fear of anxiety hurting those you love is so heavy and so real. I don’t have much comfort to offer other than that you are not alone. No matter what you are not alone. I hope things turn around for you and that love, patience, and peace find you again."

hiking,f1wgvw4,t1_f1v4l97,1569784624.0,"The town sees more people since there is a restaurant run out of someone’s home!  Once you head near the devils punchbowl and backcountry people start to thin out. Mainly from the fact you need a 4WD and high clearance vehicle. But also with social media, almost all national forests are seeing a significant increase of visitors."

AskReddit,evaxnv1,t3_ciwolg,1564360113.0,Waking up Sunday mornings to my family laughing downstairs. My dad would make dog food omelettes (term was coined from my dad jokingly saying he would make my brother and Is omelette with dog food). We would do stuff around the house and just be together an talk. One of my favorite childhood memories since we all were busy and this was a moment we were always together.
