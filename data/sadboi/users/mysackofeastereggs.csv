depression,ezbnin5,t3_d0kxgd,1567822856.0,What is something you love doing?
depression,ez0uut3,t3_czo1ne,1567642239.0,You can be grateful for everything and still be depressed because you have a chemical imbalance
depression,eypdu0q,t3_cxznuf,1567297253.0,"Here's the thing. You should never blame yourself for wanting those things. We are only human. We have a natural need for some kind of companionship. Also, not everyone is the same. Some are built for wanting intimacy, and some are asexual, and some are perfectly happy being alone. I myself am not one of those people. You cannot force yourself to not want what you crave. That also doesn't mean you have to co depend on someone to satisfy those cravings to achieve true happiness. (I know that might not have been the point of your post, I just wanted to clarify that). I personally don't know what your situation is, but all I can say is don't deprive yourself of what would make you happy, but achieve it in a healthy way."

BreakUps,ew2t0bl,t3_cmclep,1565055112.0,"Honestly fuck love. It only exists if we create it. It isn't perfect, it isn't some fantasy where everything is always about happiness. If someone who cared for you for so long can easily just walk away like it all meant nothing and literally say nothing for months then it never existed in the first place. The thing about our generation is you really don't know with people anymore. They can make you think that they will love you unconditionally and do all these things that make you think it means something or have all these moments where it feels like it will last forever. But it never does. Everyone really is only out for themselves. You gotta be careful, those who wear their heart on their sleeve, like I used to."
depression,ew2pece,t3_cmcier,1565052514.0,I'm on a schedule where I gotta get up at 5am and clock in at 6. Sometimes I work 12 hour days. I'm so tired all the time and feel like shit during the day but I can't actually sleep at night but when I do the 2 days I'm off I sleep for like 10 or 12 hours. So yeah getting up for that is a struggle. I've only been at this job for 2 months and have called out 4 times.

BreakUps,etpo6n9,t3_ccrd2q,1563060514.0,Oh god. 5 years is so long. I'd literally wanna die
BreakUps,etopzr5,t3_ccg48i,1563034537.0,"I clean a lot more 
I drive every day
Got a new job and busting my ass 
I can listen to my music 24/7 again 
I've become more social 
Only downside is the drinking and being shitty to my body but that is it's own process"
BreakUps,eoyeqpd,t3_btfn5a,1558939120.0,Give that love you gave to them to yourself
