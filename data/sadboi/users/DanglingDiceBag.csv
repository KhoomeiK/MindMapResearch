Cannabis has been the only thing keeping me together through this craziness. There are so many options now for all sorts of things. If you go to a knowledgeable budtender/dispensary and let them know what kind of issues you are hoping to address, they should be able to give you a few good recommendations on where to start. There are many different delivery methods as well so don't feel like you have to take a fat rip off a bong just to get relief. Although that might help too. lol!

TwoXChromosomes,fh2e1ga,t1_fh2cgof,1581248387.0,"A rape victim and a doctor required annual pap in exchange for birth control are two completely different things. You're comparing apples and oranges here. 

Gardasil has been openly available since 2006. All women should not be forced into annual unnecessary paps because you weren't ""lucky enough"" to get the vaccines. Personal responsibility goes a long way with sexual health. If anything you should take your experience and educate others of the dangers of HPV transmission and advocate for safe sex.

Your advocacy for unnecessary and traumatic paps for all women because it diagnosed your HPV and was great for you is the real poor decision here. It's sad that you advocate for other women's rights to be infringed upon when realistically if you were practicing responsible and safe sex you would have gone and gotten tested and wouldn't have had to rely on an annual pap. Condom or not. Multiple partners? You get tested. Period."

However, all women should not be subjected to annual exams that are medically unnecessary because other women make poor decisions."
