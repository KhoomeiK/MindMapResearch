Debby Ryan, @hailiejade, Karen Gillan, Portia Doubleday, Sophie Turner
    
What are your current ""blockers""? (e.g. budget) budget, I can't afford the more expensive clothes. But mainly blocked by having no idea where to start and little fashion sense.
    

What's your current ""style""?
Wearing whatever I find in normal shops that look normal enough for me to blend in with everyone else. I don't have my own style but I would like one. So casual jumpers, t shirts, skinny jeans, trainers. I normally wear baggy tops and tight jeans and a puffy coat. Not really girly or feminine.
    

Age? (Only so I can figure out what's age-appropriate)
21
    

Celebrity that looks like you (so I can get an idea of your hair color, etc.)?
Dark brown hair, dark blue eyes. Maybe like Kristen Bell, face structure wise. 
    

Do you prefer variety or versatility? Or a little of both?
Little of both
   

 ""Goal"" - For what purpose do you want to look this way? What are the practical takeaways from changing your look that will help you evaluate if the change is ""working""?
Feeling more confident and more like an actual person with their own personality instead of just trying to fit in."
