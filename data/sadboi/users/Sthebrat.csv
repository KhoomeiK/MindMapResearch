The thing with exercise; is it will tone your body and help shape and burn calories but ultimately to lose weight you‚Äôre going to need to intake less than you burn weekly.

While skating outdoors, a lot of the time you‚Äôre going to want to skate with a staggered stance. Your dominant foot will be leading a few inches above your non dominant foot, and this helps when you go over cracks, off small bumps, over twigs etc. If one foot catches something, the other is quickly behind to set down. 
The way you are skating is lovely, and super stable and strong for your third day! It took me a while to even lift my feet off the ground comfortably. Also, pushing the way you are skating is totally okay as well and sometimes you‚Äôll naturally skate that way to gain speed, momentum while going forward or uphill. 
Happy skating :)

Also don‚Äôt worry about falling, just worry about landing. When you feel like you‚Äôre balance is giving out on you squat low so you are close to the ground. 
Try to keep your feet in a V formation, and push side to side rather than just walking forward. 
When you get a new pair of skates, roll those wheels with your hand and see how fast they go. If they‚Äôre hardly moving, I suggest loosening the wheels. If they move too fast for your liking, tighten them until you‚Äôre more comfortable. (A T tool sold often online or in skate shops is very useful to purchase, as it adjusts your wheels and trucks) 
Smooth pavement (tennis courts, empty parking lots)  are easier spots to begin learning  since they‚Äôre usually smooth (watch for any rocks and twigs, some you can skate over some will bump you) 
YouTube videos are a lovey help! Don‚Äôt ever be afraid to ask anyone either, most skaters are down to help teach. 

Sorry but I also agree with a comment above, I would steer away towards Impala personally from the history is has with breaking heels. Not to bash on anyone who currently owns them but I just know sometimes people need $100 to go a bit longer than a few months. I would recommend the Riedelle Angel boot, it‚Äôs sold on their website as an artistic/outdoor boot for $135 (in two colors only). That or a beach bunny by Moxi; which is their sister company. The beach bunny comes in a few funky colors for $150. Candy girl are also skates that run around the $100 and also come in a few different colorful shades. 

Happy skating!"
