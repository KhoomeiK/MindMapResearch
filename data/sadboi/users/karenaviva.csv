President Mahoney said ""it won't be the same, but it will be good."" I think it can be good. The is a contingent of faculty who are so caught in their tantrum about their inability to transfer knowledge in a digital format that they are actively not making it good. The arguments about why they can't do it really run the gamut, but it is basically a tantrum. Similarly, we have a host of students who are, essentially, also engaged in a tantrum. There are, of course, as has been pointed out, some courses that simply cannot be done in a digital way because of accreditation or because of equipment required. As there are students who, because of legitimate disabilities or lack of access to computers or internet, or other factors, cannot engage successfully with the material remotely. All I can say is ""what would you suggest?"" If remote doesn't work for a student, then sadly, they may have to sit out a semester. That happens to students because of other things that do not rise to the level of a pandemic. There's a lot of creativity being applied to the issue of how to be responsible to courses that require hands-on activity. But SO MUCH BITCHING about remote instruction. I recommend a book called _The End of College_ that shows that Harvard hopped on the clue bus about rigorous, remote instruction. I have one at a (non-CA) prestigious school that is crazy-talking about F2F in fall and one in law school and I'll be darned if in encourage them to return to campus. It's on-line or nothing.
