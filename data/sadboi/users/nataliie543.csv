I too isolated myself when going through with withdrawal & the subsequent months afterwards. It wasn't until I felt strong enough to resist temptation that I started hanging out with them again. Months later when I shared with them my story, they understood why they had received the cold shoulder. They never held it against me & supported me through the whole process... I hope you have the same luck.
