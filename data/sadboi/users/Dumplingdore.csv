To be clear, her understanding of the complex nuances of ""like vs want vs love vs hate"" is immature.  She's not even three.  She doesn't know what she really means with ""don't love"" or ""hate"" or how it might impact others including you.

At this point, she is probably just expressing dissatisfaction.

I do get it, though.  We work hard to be the best parents we can be under some tough situations... it's not easy... It takes a while for kids to appreciate the sacrifices of a parent.

You don’t have to know.  In fact, it’s okay to not know everything. Truly. You can’t know for 100% certain of the future.  Not factually.  You can speculate and guess... but you can’t fully 100% know for certain.  

That’s a difference between a FEELING and knowing. 

Since you don’t know, please maybe destroying yourself would be too permanent for something that’s unsure.

Again, it's interesting when we can help others with self-care.  You're not alone in that.  When we are in the role of the care-giver it is often because we can separate ourselves from the EMOTIONS of the issue... when we are in those emotions... well that IS tough...

It’s important that we do talk please.  
Right now I am sorta guessing based on experiences, but I don’t want to put words in your mouth.  I do want to help you give yourself a voice.  With your voice, then you can create choices for yourself.

you mentioned a while back that you hardly get any sleep, is that still true?  
Sometimes people get caught up in sleep deprivation spirals... for example, if one has stress/anxiety/depression then one might sleep poorly.  On the other hand, chronic sleep deprivation can lead to severe stress/anxiety/depression and worse... so much so that sleep deprivation can be used for torture... sometimes it doesn't matter what the cause is... it's like the chicken or the egg... once you are in the spiral, you just keep spinning...

(This was a long time ago before when everyone carried around a smartphone.)

I would scribble... or write... I can distinctly remember sometimes pressing so hard the tip of the black ball-point pen would start to carve into the paper... I think if I knew about self-harm, I woulda... I think that was my old-school-cool version of self harm... watching the ink rip through and spill over darkness as the white notebook paper would split apart.

&#x200B;

I would capture everything...  the perceptions the feelings the analysis quotes.  And then I would go back... maybe correct or clarify or revise... edit...

&#x200B;

I kept it... and it's complete cringe... but It's my cringe, my past.

Seeing words and images in black and white (or red or blue or green) helped me process... Seeing the words in my head flow onto the paper helped me...

Oftentimes, I just needed to get it out... and then once I Recognized what I was feeling, I could Understand more... 

Once I saw my words.. I was better able to express what i was feeling to others... it wasn't just the long fuuuuuuuuuuck that my sole was feeling... it was more of expressing things in a way to help others understand.  

But really... it helped me understand myself better... it got me through on and off ten years of shittiness where I was working hard to show others that things weren't as shitty as I was feeling.

I am glad you are physically safe.  I am sad for you, of course, about your past abuse.  It must be scary for you still to have them still in your life.  Maybe scary doesn’t cover it all... I would imagine lots of conflicting emotions which makes it tough. 

It must be very overwhelming for you, so I escaping would be a natural reaction.  

You mentioned fear and control.  
I would like to be respectful of those two elements.  

It might be hard to talk and vent, so if you would choose, we can be here for you.  Sometimes the venting can help sort through all of it.  Perhaps we can find other ways of escaping besides suicide?"

I get that you're haunted and feeling broken... but I want to verify that you are not in danger from these people...

I do certainly understand your feelings that you have learned ""risk avoidance"" so strongly that it is practically brain-washed... it is almost emotional muscle memory... it may FEEL instinctual... 

Feelings are indeed powerful... so as you say things ""SEEM like an ALMOST impossible CHALLENGE.""

Please know, I am not here to argue with you... My words are written with warmth and support.  
I do recognize that your (probably) subconscious mind sought help on this subreddit... and your subconscious mind inserted words that allow for possibilities.

I agree that it does SEEM that way.
That it feels ALMOST impossible
And that life is indeed a CHALLENGE.

Factually... developing courage is a challenge... it is not FACTUALLY impossible... and it may SEEM as it can't be done...

But as you said... you just got up the enough courage to perhaps broadcast your suicide...

You asked a few questions...

Is this normal life?  sorta.   I mean, everyone faces shit in his or her life... maybe not everyone talks about it, but I know i faced a bunch of crap... Made me stronger...

Does this happen to everyone?  Everyone is a big number... probably not everyone... I'm guessing Paris Hilton didn't get bullied the way you and I did... but I think lots of people fight through adversity... some people more than others... I was talking to a kid who was growing up in Syria... That's tough stuff.  

Am I just a bitch and need to get on with it? Well it doesn't matter if you are or are not a bitch... as far as I know... we can't go back in time... so pretty much moving forward is what we got.  From what you describe, I'm pretty sure you can do it.

Do you need help?  Probably... doesn't necessarily mean psych help... could be supportive people like family and friends.  or internet strangers... and there's nothing wrong with a therapist.

we're not alerting others that there's sexual intercourse somewhere, watch out...
