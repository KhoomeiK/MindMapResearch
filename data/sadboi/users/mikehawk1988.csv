About two years ago I have however found great interest in modeling and data science using Python. I know the topic is very overhyped, and I count myself as one out of many hyped people, but I still don't know how to enter this field. I was accepted for a MSc in bioinformativs but stupidly rejected out of fear of failing. Would you say there is a way to get into the industry as a data scientist by starting as an intern, etc? Classical Biotechnology highly depresses me because it contains so much wet lab work. So far I did an okay job using Python for automated image segmentation using a U-Net (during my MSc) and I would love to have similar projects in the future.

*Data analyst might be the better term"
biotech,fpbtx5d,t1_fpbrkjy,1588478623.0,What's your suggestion for people who want to get there with Biotechnology degrees?
biotech,fpbsel3,t1_fpb7t3a,1588477540.0,"I actually used Python for my M.Sc. for automated image analysis. But my colleagues used it for backscatter triggered harvesting of their cultures, etc. So coding has lots of use for automatisation in Biotechnology."
biotech,fpazm4e,t3_gcd6g8,1588459023.0,"I'd say you only need to code if you want to get into modeling and a more statistics related field. I'd say classical biotechnology doesn't require programming that much, but that's just my experience. I can honestly advise you to get a little bit into Python. It's fun and you can do lots of stuff with it. You can be much more flexible evaluating data as with Excel and it's a very good way to impress your employers. University professors always work with MatLab and similar programs, but in my and other people's opinion you can do everything with Python, and its easy to use. Me and my colleagues learned how to apply it in just a few days to weeks.

1. Install miniconda (it contains the newest Python version) [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2. Make sure to add Python to PATH if on Windows (if you don't know what this means just look it up on google, it's very straightforward)
3. create a virtual environment by entering ""conda create --name myenv"" in the terminal/CMD (virtual environments are closed environments similar to folders where you can separately install python versions and packages. This just makes sure that different projects don't interfere with each other. There are so many packages or libraries that do most stuff for you, so you only need to know how to execute the methods from packages)
4. Activate the virtual environment by entering ""conda activate myenv"" in the terminal/CMD
5. Install jupyter notebook using the terminal/CMD by entering ""conda install jupyter"" in the terminal/CMD. Jupyter notebook is basically the notebook that you use for writing and executing your code
6. Execute Jupyter notebook by entering ""jupyter notebook"" in the terminal/CMD
7. Start coding

Sorry if this sounds confusing. It's really not. All these steps are always the same and you just get used to it very very quickly. The packages you will most probably need are Numpy (for manipulating arrays), Pandas (for creating dataframes just like Excel sheets), scipy (toolkit for scientific computation), matplotlib or Seaborn (for plotting stuff). Python itself contains many packages such as statistics or random that allow you to do all sorts of things.

If you want to learn to code (or rather script), I recommend Corey Shafer or Sentdex on Youtube. First thing I learned was over the Android app ""SoloLearn"". It teaches you most of the basics in an uncomplicated manner and was fun to use. It also has a nice community that likes to work on little projects and teach stuff.

It's interesting that you mentioned this, because this really freaks me out a lot. Bending over, lying on my back. It triggers these PVCs or sudden stronger pumps, and a very weird feeling in my chest. 

Interval training is my biggest fear.. because if my heart rate exceeds a certain rate it makes me really uncomfortable. I did however almost sprint a few days ago for a short period and I did fine. Somehow only on certain days it doesn't matter how quickly I run, the weakness, fatigue, palpitations just come. 

I agree that exposure is the best thing you can do. I think fears can only be overcome if you expose yourself to them. It's still very hard. But I'm ""doing my best"" (very contradictory, since ""fighting"" a fear only makes it worse).

I've been having panic attacks for quite a while now and got used to them.. but I don't know how to prevent them. I mean mostly I'm used to it. I still kind of freak out about it. Just now after running I felt so weak, making me afraid that the more time passes, the weaker I'll feel and eventually I'll pass out. Luckily that didn't happen so far. This sometimes happens to me if I have longer periods of anxiety, and mostly after running. Things like these make me think I do have some sort of illness, because it's been around since so long. Three weeks ago I managed to go running again, and it was okay, but now the anxiety just comes back and fucks everything up. By the way I've read the book half-way through (Hope and Help for your Nerves) and it's been great so far.. probably one of the best things you could do when having panic attacks. I managed to deal with panic not caused by exercise. But I don't know how to overcome panic caused by exercise. Sure, exercise is healthy, but not if you're sick.

If you're then done with it you might go into theory of things. Maybe even parallel to making the track.
I had a guitar teacher when I was little who got me into playing. I was so excited by it simply because he was so good at playing and he teacher me to play certain songs. I heard from so many people that the music theory discouraged them. I too had then a second teacher who mainly taught me theory.. He was very theoretical about it and took all my motivation. Maybe you can find a good balance between producing and theory. Either in a parallel or sequential way.

science,fnzq3ay,t1_fnzf39p,1587398741.0,"Hey man, I'm also suffering from DP/DR since 13 years now. It wasn't induced by weed, but rather stress, but I know how hard it can be. Only some years ago I heard of the term DP/DR for the first time and it really relieved me a lot. Before, I didn't know how to express myself, how to describe this weird sensation. Nobody ever understood what I was going through. A year ago I ate an edible and had another intense panic attack coupled with intense DP/DR. The DP/DR doesn't frighten me anymore since I'm so used to it, but it's basically my life and it's weird as hell. It's an issue that isn't adressed enough. Only a few Youtubers talk about this condition and I think it's a serious problem.

\*Btw 13 years ago my DP/DR was so strong that I was barely able to move. From one moment to another I didn't know how to do sports anymore. I felt weird playing football, didn't know how to move as if I had suddenly unlearned everything. It's as if my mind reset and I'd be 8 again. I was 15 by that time. It left behind some huge scars and depression. Luckily I am now doing fine, but I still constantly feel like I'm in a dream, just not that intense anymore."
science,fnzpjcc,t3_g4sku7,1587398456.0,"Hi doctors, 

when I ate a cannabis edible I had an intense panic attack where I thought I had a heart attack. I've been having those before, but eating cannabis this one time induced a full year of constant panic attacks, heart pounding and nausea, among other symptoms. Luckily I have it under control now, but I am still very prone.

I was just wondering if there's an explanation for this and if such panic attacks can be fully assigned to the ""psyche"", or if the ""body"" is also primarily concerned, and not just reacts to this change in state of the mind.

Best regards"

Anxiety,fny3cj3,t3_g4bn38,1587352405.0,I'm a coffee junkie but have to reduce my consumption during phases of intense panic attacks. I'd say you should only drink it if your stress levels are low. On the other side it even takes my stress since I associate only positive things with it. But it's known to affect your anxiety. You should know best what works for you. Cheers!
Anxiety,fny2r9b,t1_fnxkh45,1587351995.0,"So what? You're frustrated and to screw on everything is understandable. You will get past this as soon as you start enjoying things again. Just give it some time.

*I'm gonna go sleep now. Maybe sleep over it too or distract yourself with some videogames. Tomorrow is another day where you can think of other strategies. Just start it slow."
Anxiety,fny2jfw,t3_g4i1cv,1587351843.0,"Hey man. Please know that it always takes some time to get over things. That sounds like a horrible experience and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. But you gotta give it a bit of time. Trust me that time heals all wounds. Sometimes it can take longer but you need to be patient. Just don't give up. You're only 18 and during that age it's normal to feel restless. Ive been having depersonalization/derealization since 13 years now, which is the same as dissociation. It started when I was 15 due to me moving to another country. I didn't necessarily think about harming myself but I was feeling horrible. It was so strong that I could barely move and it felt like nothing was real. I didn't even know how to express this feeling and nobody ever knew except that I was acting all weird. But I started distracting myself with music and doing sports. With the years I started making friends again and it all went back to normal. Of course everything leaves behind scars, but at some point you simply don't care anymore and enjoy life. It comes automatically because your mind is flexible. Also alcohol might help in the short run but it only makes this feeling worse in the long run. Especially when it comes to anxiety. If there's anything you would like to talk about just hit me up!"
computerscience,fny1ifg,t3_g44mq5,1587351155.0,"The word ""AI"" always makes me a little but angry because that's just a term to attract people. Most times it's not AI in a strict sense. Maybe doing that AI course is therefore the lesser choice because the term itself implies that they are not being enough technical about it? Maybe I'm wrong. Wish you good luck!"
Anxiety,fny19nj,t3_g4icww,1587350993.0,"Just don't compare yourself to others unless they inspire you. Otherwise that takes all your creativity and motivation. Be proud in what you do, do baby steps and learn by doing. If you love game development so much, what are you stressing yourself for? Sure, if you want to get good at something you will always need a healthy dose of discipline, but stressing about it only sets one under pressure. Wish you good luck doing that!"
Anxiety,fny0fxn,t3_g4ior0,1587350438.0,"If you're into computer generated art I highly suggest you to download Blender, which is a free software that competes with the best. Also look up ""Ian Hubert"" on Youtube to get inspired. Apart from that I personally love doing music using Ableton. And casually I also use Paint Tool Sai to draw stuff.

*BTW blender might seem too complicated but as soon as you learned the basics everything will work automatically. Just make sure to memorize a few important keyboard shortkeys."
learnpython,fnxy487,t3_g4iav3,1587348885.0,"Learning by doing > textbooks, in my opinion. ""But you will not get all the fundamentals and and and"". Well, textbooks are dry as hell and you will quickly be demotivated. Secondly, you can always read things up when you are stuck. Also, you can learn the fundamentals reading articles on the internet. For the beginning, I found the ""sololearn"" app to be really useful. Of course that's just my opinion."
