AskReddit,feifup6,t1_feifdqz,1579137551.0,Oh yeah and later that night we witnessed earth's rotation as we saw the whole sky moving but we blamed it on weed becuase the sober gf did not feel that.
AskReddit,feifdqz,t3_eown98,1579137235.0,"Last summer me and my friends went to the seaside in our country. It was the end of the season so the whole city was empty and ghosted, but that's normal, happens every year when I go there at the end of August. We were stoned all the time, except for my best friend's gf as she doesn't like smoking this much. One day we decided that we are going to go to the beach at night, to watch the night sky at the beach. So we did. Lying on the sand, really relaxed. Everybody (6 people total) is enjoying really magnificent view. I don't remember if it was me or somebody else but we noticed some shooting stars, completely normal for the late August. But there was one particular star which wasn't moving like any other shooting stars. It wasn't a just a flash as others, it was moving in a one direction. We were't surprised at first as we know satellites are a thing. But as soon as we all agreed on that, the strange star suddenly stopped. Kept still for a moment. Then changed direction 90 degrees. We all noticed that. The sober gf also. Strange star kept on fucking with us, going forward, stopping and changing directions again for a few more times. This wasn't a helicopter, we should have been able to hear it as if it was indeed that, but the only thing we heard was quiet chilling sound of calm waves coming to coast, plus the light it sheded was like any other ""normal"" star. We have absolutely no idea what it was. It was the first and last time that we have noticed anything like that in our lives.

Please excuse my english as I am no native speaker."
