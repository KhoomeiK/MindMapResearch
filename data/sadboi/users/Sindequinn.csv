I can't imagine the pain you feel rn, and I'm assuming she's your 1st or 2nd love, something close to that. She WILL be back but DONT FUCKING DO IT. My first love jerked me around for 7 years before I caught on. Download a dating app, hang out with your friends, do not go on a drinking or drugging binge, and everything will be okay."

It's fun not feeling like that for a couple days. My depressive episodes last months as well, then a measly couple days of mania. Its nice while it lasts lol"
BipolarReddit,eurpkjp,t3_ch67d2,1563997225.0,"Mania is different for everyone. I'm depressed 95% of the time and manic like 5%. I'm very rarely I'm the neutral area. I sleep 10-12 hours every day, my boyfriend pays for a maid, I literally hate life and don't get much of anything done. If OP dealt with this feeling you'd understand why some people wish to be manic more often. Who cares if I wild the fuck out a little? I also get to enjoy being alive for 1 single day.
But I definitely understand that being manic ALL the time would be terrible. Both ends of the spectrum suck."
