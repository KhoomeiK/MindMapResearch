SexWorkers,fbtovij,t1_fbtmovd,1577088066.0,"Definitely not trying to promote, I haven't even mentioned my username - so talking about ""don't judge people""...?"
SexWorkers,fbjlq8q,t1_fbjlnj4,1576935912.0,"His first offer was Â£500, I don't think the bloke even has that kind of money haha"
SexWorkers,fbjbgnt,t1_fbjb1g3,1576929775.0,"Yea this is true, I've pretty much only put up with him because he was one of my first subscribers when I started and he's been loyal and he did send me good tips but he can't seem to reel this wind of behaviour in so I think cutting him loose might be the best idea!"
SexWorkers,fbj12le,t1_fbj0y0z,1576921832.0,Theres m+f content on my OnlyFans with my ex ðŸ˜¬ if he doesn't behave from now on I'm just going to get rid I think x
SexWorkers,fbixr9f,t1_fbixkpn,1576918775.0,"I've toyed with the idea but he is a good buyer, I just have to ignore/stand up to all this type bullshit first. I've given him a warning now that if he speaks like that again I'll be cutting contact so let's see if he can finally behave!"
SexWorkers,f08d4f0,t1_f08cyuu,1568479754.0,Thank you for your advice! x
SexWorkers,f07c6ae,t1_f07c4ma,1568457397.0,I have 30 fans
SexWorkers,f06wbpb,t1_f06vw9v,1568447182.0,I'm on twitter too! Not sure if it's the hashtags I'm using but I rarely get any followers or any fans from it. No idea what I'm doing wrong
SuicideWatch,eyn9aal,t1_eyinxf1,1567237345.0,"Everything, I'm skint, I haven't got a job and my anxiety makes it hard for me to have one, I don't have any local friends, I'm not in contact with family and I miss them. I just have a rough time."
SuicideWatch,evcs7bm,t3_cj0tqt,1564422110.0,Congratulations on making it through the evening. Good luck with everything moving forward x
BPD,evcrwqm,t3_cj5rsq,1564421924.0,Absolutely relate to this
BPD,ev92w9p,t3_cin84i,1564303164.0,"Yep, always had this problem. I worsened it for myself by getting unlovable tattooed on my forehead last January and now I'm constantly stared at. One thing I have found though is that my tattoo is an excellent ignorance indicator, nice people will glance at it and smile at me and other people will stare and rudely question me on it."
BPD,eukfu9q,t1_eukfa2m,1563887743.0,"He's said to me that he feels stuck behind in years, he comes across very young too. His communication skills and vocabulary is really lacking and he struggles to understand a lot of words. I've been taking steps with him to get him ""living"" - I helped him open a bank account, got him to the jobcentre to claim universal credit, I've got him doctors appointments and mental health appointments. But behind closed doors it's just this."
SuicideWatch,eoiyall,t1_eoijgrg,1558629776.0,"I work and don't earn enough to pay my bills. I'm constantly stressed about trying to stay alive.

 I have a mental health condition called Borderline personality disorder and I find it hard to regulate my emotions. 

I'm 26 and I've never really been loved, properly - I've been in a lot of abusive relationships where I've been taken advantage of and my parents threw me out as a child so I didn't get their love either. 

I'm just not happy living."
