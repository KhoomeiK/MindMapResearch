BPD,f3tqyrf,t3_dhrywv,1571143789.0,DAE have bad dreams/nightmares every night? I can’t remember the last time I’ve had a good or somewhat pleasant dream. Sometimes I wake up with headaches from them.
POTS,f1mli9x,t1_f1mkpop,1569596684.0,"Heart rate does (typically) increase by at least 30 upon standing. Which is why I had originally thought of POTs. Since starting the medication however it doesn’t increase as much or nearly as often, but BP is still all over the place."
BPD,f1elno9,t3_d919zr,1569425038.0,All the time! I’ll post something and then end up deleting it
SNPedia,f0rrn0d,t1_f0quttd,1568891278.0,Ohh okay I see. Thanks for the help 😊
BPDSongs,f0585z1,t3_d3ld0m,1568404090.0,Thank you for this 👏🏻👏🏻
BPD,ez491v8,t3_czwcod,1567683138.0,"Ever since my moms passing I feel this way constantly. When things are really bad, which they usually are, I just want to go home... but it’s like “home” doesn’t exist anymore. SHE was home for me. It sucks when you’re your only source of safety and comfort but you don’t know how to give yourself that."
POTS,evc6q2a,t1_evb6p58,1564407821.0,"Even the thoracic surgeon I saw didn’t really take the pectus seriously to be honest. I had expressed concerns about the Nuss procedure (pain, time off work, etc) and it was determined I don’t NEED to have it done despite my symptoms. I didn’t really have much tests done for it though. I don’t even know what my Haller index is. 🤦🏼‍♀️ so it’s really hard to tell if my symptoms are truly because of that. 

I’m seeing my PCP later today to discuss the heart rate. I’ll probably ask for a referral to a cardiologist. I’ll keep you updated"
