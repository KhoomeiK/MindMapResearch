Huge investment from Chinese will make the lives of animators better and we might see fewer studio bankruptcy.

3. No you are under exaggerating our future. Societies are function of Technology, not the vice versa. Corporatism will also pave away for communism. Corporatism will slow down wealth flow and there is now way that masses will tolerate that . Technically, primitive communism is corporatism where the state itself is a corporate. And there will be human representation in the governments but as useful humans are in an automated car factory."

librandu,f1zfxdb,t1_f1z5uq7,1569843057.0,"I believe communism is the future. There is no other option available just like Democracy is. The state of highest entropy. Communism is what I call democratization of wealth and all these Hindu nationalism movements will die off because religions die all the time. The faster the country develops, the faster will religion withers. In short, the age of religion is over. It is already dead among youths in the East Asia and Western countries. 

Again I don't think that the world is ready for communism. There is not enough technology to implement it and  just like Democracy didn't work in Rome, communism did not survive in Soviet Russia just because  planned economy experiments didn't work . The faults that lies in both of them are : Inadequate technology. 

With more technological developments in the field of data science, machine learning and new space race, things will no longer be same in.. say 3 decades. You would no longer need a popularity contest to get someone who makes decision for you and the need for human governments will decrease. The concepts of nation will fail, religions will be dead. It will be either Corporatism or Communism running the world based on huge data collected thanks to the successor of 5G and models built based on those datas. China is already working on that. 


Why I am left libertarian right now? 

You can't be a Buddha in a battle field. Left because I think Governemrt should provide the NEEDS like minumum Healthcare, education and minimum nutritional requirement, minimum housing because there is no point in becoming a citizen if your basic needs are not meant inspite of giving up your liberty. 

In Anarchy, You can meet your basic needs as long as your survive. You can steal, farm, build your home wherever you want to, do whatever you wish just like our ancestors and we give up those rights to be governed by an authority so I belive that Government has obligation to fulfill those basic needs. A homeless guy can build his wooden home anywhere in an Anarchy but he has to sleep in the pavements in the capitalist democracy. 



For WANTS, you need a yatch? You want to eat a 5K dinner at a lavish hotel? You want to go on a tour or have a gang bang? Do whatever you wish. Buy 10 houses and have 14 concubines? Idgaf. These is where the free market should work. Government should generate electricity but should not sell Cola. 



Planned economy for Needs. 
Free Market  for Wants."
