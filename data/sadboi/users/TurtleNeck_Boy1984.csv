BPD,feljun0,t3_epo6vl,1579223915.0,"I have a terrible fear of rejection, and this fear has led me to stay with abuse people in the past. Heck Iâ€™m scared that my friends, which are not manipulating me in any way, are secretly plotting something in the background. Being gullible is apart of it but I also feel like Iâ€™m a â€˜magnetâ€™ almost for manipulation? If that makes sense?

Idk Iâ€™m bad at explaining how I feel but please know I do feel the same way."

television,ewkur7c,t3_cohip1,1565495226.0,"For this show called The Missing, the first episode is slow until the huge payoff at the end. Itâ€™s about a father that is still searching for his lost son several years later, and new evidence has finally come up that may be able to help... Its fantastic, and it also has a second season I believe. Highly recommend! :)"
