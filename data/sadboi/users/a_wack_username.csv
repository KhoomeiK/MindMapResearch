unpopularopinion,fmgk824,t1_fmclaa1,1586050864.0,Sorry I should have explained more when I said they were all of a sudden “fixed”. They would get sad when they broke up with someone and said on their Snapchat “I’m so depressed. I can’t keep him off my mind” then they would get another boyfriend and say “you’re the one and only and I can believe I was depressed over that guy”. I completely understand when you say how some of your friends were happy then in the hospital the next. I’m sorry you had to experience that.
unpopularopinion,fmbt3i6,t1_fmbqudr,1585932710.0,That makes sense. I have never seen positive comparing of children before but hopefully it can be a thing now. Possibly to help the child grow in a positive way.
unpopularopinion,fmbr90n,t3_fuaiqd,1585931743.0,I’ve tried killing myself 5 times and harmed for years. When I hear people say they are “depressed” but all of a sudden they’re better. No honey that’s called sadness. Depression is not getting out of bed because you can’t find a reason to. Depression is long periods of times. I was so depressed in junior high I can’t remember a single thing that happened. What pissed me off was when my sister friend said she had depression. When I asked did she get diagnosed she said she just know she is. That’s not how it fucking works god dammit. Being depressed isn’t a trend and “cool”. It’s torture I wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy.
unpopularopinion,fmbq564,t3_fuaobj,1585931163.0,I agree until it comes to the confederate flag. They keep saying it’s inherited but all I see if a big “fuck you” to my family.
unpopularopinion,fmbpo4d,t3_fub5y5,1585930919.0,"I gonna have to disagree on this one. 1) I’ve seen what happens when nice parents say their child is gifted. They aren’t saying it in a Karen way but being genuine. They did show signs of being gifted. However as they were told this they either went 2 ways. They would not try as hard or improve because their gifted. Then they would fall behind and lose that gift. They could also become extremely narcissistic. They think their better than everyone because they were told they were gifted all the time. 
2) I’ve been compared to other people in my family a lot. “Why don’t you have these grades like your brother?” “Why aren’t you fit like your sister?” “Your gonna be fat like you grandma” I was told all these things while I was skinny and a straight A student. When I wasn’t enough for them I finally broke down. I was already spiraling into a deep depression at a young age. When I finally snapped I tried taking my life several times. If I couldn’t meet my families expectations why keep on living? 
TL:DR- Comparing children can lead to a deep depression or narcissism"
entitledparents,fieuhhc,t3_f7gt80,1582382703.0,The sad fact is that I could see my teacher doing this. She told my friend she didn’t need to go to a doctors appointment. A doctors appointment that has kept her alive ever since she was 3.
SuicideWatch,fawhn1j,t3_e5tfi6,1576371374.0,This is exactly how I was. I didn’t see me walking across the graduation stage or getting into college. After being in a deep depression for such a long time I decide to start drawing again and I found out I do have a future and it’s to put a smile on people faces. I always try to make my friends and family smile with either a joke or showing the art. OP if making people happy or making animals happy make you happy just do it. Life isn’t always sunshine and rainbows but once you find a path it will be easier.
AmItheAsshole,f98gzva,t3_duadu9,1575178192.0,NTA I’m in the same situation as your sister except I don’t have diabetes but I do run the risk. I would be happy if my brother did that for me but he’s worse than me (he eats out for every meal of the day). I’m actually trying to lose the weight but my mom is ‘tired’ and doesn’t want to cook so she buys junk food. Honestly I would want you to be my brother because you seem caring about your family. Also OP can you send me them recipes for those foods you mentioned they sound delicious. Again definitely NTA
SuicideWatch,f8rn9lm,t1_f8n1sxc,1574745502.0,That’s good! Also when your job is getting really bad just quit man it’s not worth your mental health or life. Also if you want exercise after work cause it actually helps you get serotonin put on a movie while you do it’s can help your process things too. You could also try different foods to add a little spice to your day
SuicideWatch,f8knsur,t3_e0ygby,1574613176.0,1-800-273-8255 this is the suicide hotline their open 24/7. They can get you a psychiatrist. I know what it’s like going through a hard time I’m still going through hard time but I tell myself I only need 2 more years to get out of this shitty town. Trust me try to find the light at the end of the tunnel. Like looking for new tv shows For example I’m waiting for two new shows to am one come out (Helluva Boss and Steven Universe Future). If you want a laugh just ask me I got memes for days. If you want to vent I’m here.
SuicideWatch,f8klxqt,t3_e0xjf0,1574612564.0,I wouldn’t do it. The scars it leaves behind are ugly. I would know cause I have them. But please just do something else like painting etc but what I got from my therapist is have a hair tie on your wrist and just  smack your self with it it’s better.
