depression,foifh9s,t1_foi1rtq,1587785424.0,"It actually took me a couple years to finally get my diagnosis. I had been fairly regularly seeing a few different psychologists over a few years (moved to college so switched psychologists) and had finally decided to give medication a try, which was when I got a referral to see a psychiatrist who was the one who formally gave me a diagnosis.

I don't know what it is about psychologists but they don't usually tell you a diagnosis unless you physically ask? My psychiatrist straight up told me after my consultation based off my history.

I'd suggest just calling your doctor and asking for a referral to speak to a psychiatrist if that's what you're looking for."
depression,fofcmpc,t3_g76n13,1587732775.0,"Honestly, that's how I felt about depression before I was medically diagnosed for it. I wanted a reason for feeling this way all the time and not having anything so that I had a explanation for why I felt so fucked up.

I've also definitely had thoughts of hoping that something terrible happen to me so that the way I'm feeling and reacting had a ""valid reason"" to it, but also feeling like I don't really want anything like that to happen because it could possibly make how I'm feeling worse?"

For me it's really just 1-2 minutes of pulling into the parking garage so not too bad? Also I try to disengage the clutch as soon as the car starts rolling so that I'm not slipping the clutch for too long"
CivicSi,fee7i3r,t1_fdzpqkx,1579027996.0,I have not. I mostly just slip the clutch and then disengage it and just ride out the momentum when I'm going at really low speeds. In traffic just keeping more distance with the car ahead of me.
