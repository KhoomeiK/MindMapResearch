There'll be a media shitstorm about all this by Christmas because those people who bought switch lites in the past couple months won't stand for it, as casual people would be far less likely to go into the system and fix it themselves, and they shouldn't have to.

Then about 3 weeks after that she tried again because her symptoms still hadn't left and she tested positive, with doctors suspecting she's had it since she first showed symptoms as she wasnt going out anywhere else since then. She had a ""mild"" case, we were never near the point of her needing to go to hospital, but she was sick for 6 weeks.
