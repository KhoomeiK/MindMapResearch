1. Loving others as much as Jesus loves us.

2. Because my mom raised me Christian haha"

Which is to love one another. Some people read the Bible and take the beautiful stories (which is what the Bible is, a bunch of stories) that show intense love and turn them into hateful ideas and thoughts and that‚Äôs bullshit. Also... there is definitely a shit ton of human influence on scripture. There is no chance that a loving God would have ever said some of the things written in the Bible."

AdultChildren,es8tqch,t3_c59sk3,1561714267.0,"I personally have dealt with this a lot before and it‚Äôs still ongoing for me. If you are working on your anxiety and he knows that you don‚Äôt want this to be a permanent compromise then I feel like maybe he should understand. Even if it is a permanent compromise because it‚Äôs one that is necessary for you to be at ease when you are in a relationship then I think that may be okay depending on who you are with. Anxiety, especially when it comes to this particular subject, can be very harsh and terrible on people. Relationships obviously take two, and with that being said I feel like if he wants to be with you just like you want to be with him then he might just have to help you out a little more. Also, every person has ultimatums. This could be yours. And it isn‚Äôt completely unreasonable because of what you have gone through. I really believe that you aren‚Äôt asking a lot from him by insisting he communicate with you better when he is out. I‚Äôm sure that you would rather him not drink at all. Which obviously isn‚Äôt going to happen, but it isn‚Äôt like you are winning everything here and he has lost all of his ability to do what he wants. You are just simply asking for his helping hand while you go through your difficult times. If he is willing to do it then what is the problem. Also, I think with enough expression you can try to get him to understand just how much this would mean to you. Then he may be more willing to do it."

sex,epa8sq3,t1_epa7pm9,1559123956.0,That‚Äôs true for sure. Yeah I have mentioned it and she made it clear that she enjoys both equally. I. don‚Äôt think she would mind either way because she tells me that all of her orgasms are great. So I‚Äôm probably just freaking out. Lol

sex,epa7xyu,t1_epa7vtx,1559123521.0,Hahaha.
sex,epa7cks,t1_epa77o7,1559123224.0,Yeah. But the good thing is that I can also give her an orgasm with PIV. And I actually think they are bigger than the ones she gets from oral. She always has an orgasm actually. We got that part down haha.
sex,epa6vu1,t1_epa6694,1559122989.0,See so that‚Äôs the thing... I give her oral and sometimes she finishes with that and I don‚Äôt get the chance to finish from PIV. Which is what I personally like the most. But of course I still finish. But that isn‚Äôt really my main concern it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt know if to much oral pleasure is a good thing. I don‚Äôt want it to get to the point where all she wants is oral without penetration. That‚Äôs my point I guess. And when she finishes she can‚Äôt take penetration because she gets sensitive.
sex,epa5tsn,t1_epa5k5x,1559122431.0,"Yeah I see what you‚Äôre saying. But at the same time, if she gave me amazing head every time we have sex then I‚Äôm probably going to start expecting it and not wanting PIV as much lol"

sandiego,ep2g2mb,t1_ep1k0ts,1559007903.0,This is true and I agree. Thank you for your comment. It is hard for me to find friends with this same trait. In fact I have 0 as of now. But growing up with a fear of what seems to be one of the most common activities people like makes me feel pretty isolated. So trying to find friends with this same value is important to me. While I do have friends none of them share this trait and that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt love them and appreciate their company. It would just be nice to have the balance.
sandiego,ep29yxp,t1_ep08tf3,1559004866.0,Well I have friends who drink as well. But lately I have been feeling misplaced in my community and it would just be nice to have some people who have that trait in common. I have not in any way limited my friends to those who have never picked up a drink. But this post was intended for me to find some others that do share this value. It‚Äôs a tough trait to come by which is understandable but at the same time I feel like there must be some.
