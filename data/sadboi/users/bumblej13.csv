relationship_advice,fkcea8l,t1_fkce72a,1584051265.0,She asked advice about her boyfriends mum not if she should terminate her baby
relationship_advice,fkcc6hp,t3_fhij16,1584050011.0,"Iâ€™m so sorry that so many people are being so rude towards you, I think you just need to talk with your bf mum and ask her why she thinks this or if not speak to him, problems with in laws are always messy, with or without a baby involved. 
Also for all the people telling you to have a termination I hope they never have to go through the trauma of having one, because even though itâ€™s a decision that you make itâ€™s still heart breaking and I think it takes a strong person to decide to raise a baby, I couldnâ€™t have done it when I had my chance so I think youâ€™re amazing. 
Also to have endometriosis and get pregnant is amazing and how dare anyone try convince you to lose this opportunity! This is something in worry about all the time is that I lost my only chance to have a baby and how much I would regret it if it was!
My point of this comment is to tell you to ignore all the awful people, do you, and good luck in your pregnancy hope everything works out with the MIL ðŸ’—"

SkincareAddictionUK,fijs6xj,t1_fijrgly,1582462105.0,Sorry I commented it below

BodyDysmorphia,fghbm44,t3_eyeb4o,1580781198.0,What are the OCD symptoms youâ€™re presenting with? OCD is characterised by obsessive/irrational thoughts that make you carry out actions despite any logic/rationale etc
relationship_advice,f6ru0lj,t1_f6r5c1u,1573119311.0,Itâ€™s very possible to get pregnant from both assaults. Many people will have protected sex 99 times and the one time they donâ€™t they fall pregnant. I know this from experience. So in the space of 15 years itâ€™s possible for this to happen twice. Again these sort of comments stop women from reporting any sexual abuse.
relationship_advice,f6qtlw1,t3_dsl8w1,1573085592.0,I think itâ€™s disgusting that more than half the comments Iâ€™ve read are people suggesting this woman (who none of us know) is lying??? The OP is asking how to be supportive not asking for everyone to pick his fiancÃ© apart. No wonder women donâ€™t come forward straight away or at all to report a sexual assault if this is the response they get. Itâ€™s very possible for someone to be assaulted more than one time and by the sound of it this lady had been in a cycle of abuse with exes so letâ€™s cut her and the OP some slack
