I deeply know I should just let it go, it‚Äôs a process inside of me that started kicking in yesterday and is currently working it‚Äôs way through the hope that‚Äôs left inside of me.

Never ever have I met a person sticking so hardly to their narrative. I always thought it‚Äôs possible to talk things out especially when both are in love with each other.

Nothing is more traumatic than realizing it doesn‚Äôt matter or change anything what you do, the other person always tried to prove their hypothesis with you. And I realized people who have such a bad state of mental health will find ways to rationalize their fears based on your behavior.

As sad as it sounds but the truth is, some people can‚Äôt be saved.

If I need someone I‚Äôll hit you up but honestly I‚Äôve been through this so often during the past few years I think I just want the storm in my brain to settle and not think about romantic relationships with anyone for a very long time.

Every fucking individual on this planet has to improve every single day. Men or women we both have our struggles.

AskMen,flcspt8,t1_flcr448,1585044914.0,"Don‚Äôt become bitter. It‚Äôs not entirely true. I was in your position even though I‚Äôm not overweight but I was bald and in the shorter site heightwise.

It‚Äôs not easier for them, it‚Äôs more comfortable initially because they have a lot of options. I totally understand that it‚Äôs easy being sucked into the toxic mindset of some subreddits here but we have to see both sides.

Women can hook up easily and get sex but emotionally they‚Äôre not satisfied by sex the way men are. They seek emotional connection rather than intimacy. It‚Äôs more likely that it‚Äôs even harder for women to find a suiting partner because most men will trick them into sleeping with them.

The older the women gets the more bitter she will be about this. 

Another factor is that Tinder and co. are a sausage party and even average women get way too much attention which surely bumps their egos initially but ends in frustration because with more options it‚Äôs more likely to bump into creeps too.

I have a lot of very attractive female friends and I know first hand that they randomly choose who they match with. Good picture, nice bio and they‚Äôll do the like swipe. They don‚Äôt even care that much.

It‚Äôs more like a game for them to swipe or chat with a dude rather than seriously trying to find someone.

I mean they are there, women who want to find a partner but as I said 1/100.

And women are just as frustrated as men from my perspective. Believe me.

Hit the gym, improve yourself, if it helps your confidence then fine. You shouldn‚Äôt have to do it for others. Sometimes it‚Äôs enough to enjoy yourself and have a lot of social interaction with women to have someone fall in love with you regardless on how you look like.

Continue improving yourself, take nice pictures, dress nice to feel nice, enjoy yourself, be positive and put yourself out there in clubs, bars and also tinder okcupid etc. and it will eventually happen somewhen."

But honestly I recently turned 24 and I can‚Äôt speak of many moments in the past few years that truly made me happy and feel fulfilled. I only have a few moments where I felt content and happy. For example falling in love and enjoying  companionship but mostly I spent my twenties with waiting for better times to come.

Times where I can have fun with people without being worried, times where I fall in love with someone who loves me back, times where I can look into the mirror and say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù.

I told many lies and I lied to myself many times.

The truth comes out right now. I feel like I wasted my youth and I feel like I made the wrong decisions which led me to this point in life.

I spent most of my time alone hoping that time goes by for the better times to come. I‚Äôd love to socialize but it‚Äôs not possible right now. And I‚Äôd love to move to a new city to leave the memories of my ex behind, also not possible.

So I‚Äôm sitting here with fear of missing out, sitting here not feeling enough.

No matter how attractive I am and I really am as a male, no matter how charismatic I am and people often tell me I am, I don‚Äôt seem to deserve what others take as granted.

I‚Äôm sorry this turned out so deep and thoughtful."

But the story is fucked up. My ex (F28) is also my ex coworker and I left my previous job because of her and also because I was ejected from my ‚Äúleadership-throne‚Äù during a restructuring in the old company. I would have gotten a new job there but I was full of hate and frustration. 

I got myself a new job also a Leadership position in a company that relies on automotive and airlines. All customers cancelled the projects and thus payments. The company kicked all new employees out.

I started on 1st of March and was just kicked out with a big sorry today because they struggle financially. They offered to take me back as soon as this gets better but I immediately lost trust in that.

I‚Äôm not in good place financially at the moment which is why I need instant employment right now (almost no savings).

The only option I see is to go back to my old company where I wouldn‚Äôt have a probation and where they would instantly hire me again. 

The problem is my ex who has a borderline personality disorder and who I was trauma-bonded to still works there. 

We ended it on dec 22nd and I‚Äôm nowhere near being over it. 

We couldn‚Äôt even have the ‚Äúlets be adults and treat each other as coworkers‚Äù talk even if I wanted to.

That‚Äôs because I was also sued by her (and won) in January and she had wrongly accused me of domestic violence during the breakup (I know this sounds stupid but she had a panic attack and threw a tantrum, her neighbor called the cops and I was arrested, I didn‚Äôt do anything I was in shock and just stood there and said nothing) this had me in jail for two days. 

Got out on Christmas thanks to my lawyer and both of us faced no charges.


I don‚Äôt know what to do. The new apartment I was just about to rent is also canceled so my plans to move completely away from her also failed.

All because of corona and because I shat where I ate.
