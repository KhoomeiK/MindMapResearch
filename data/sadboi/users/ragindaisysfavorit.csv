SelfHate,fr01wu2,t3_glsktz,1589781341.0,"I understand this a lot. Being alone protects me from feeling stupid and hating myself unless an event causes me to spiral.

depression,fq6dq8n,t1_fq4wgqi,1589129543.0,"I understand that. I know so many people who work harder than I ever will, people who get up early in the morning to work 10 hour days the entire week while I work short shifts a couple days a week. But you know what? It can still be hard to do even that. Depression can steal your ability to handle even the slightest bit of work, and that's not your fault. Depression makes your mind and body heavy, makes the idea of getting up and leaving the house sound impossible, because you'd rather lay in bed where it's safe and no one expects anything of you. The trick, although I know this is very hard and I'm still struggling with it, is to not compare yourself to others. Some really love going to work, and they handle their troubles and negative emotions by being workaholics. Some are forced to spend all their time working to support their families. Others would rather relax, because that is how they cope. Just because there are others that have it ""worse"" than us doesn't mean we don't deserve a break still"

It is terrible that your parents said that to you when you told them you're suicidal, they're supposed to be there for you. Is there anyone else you could stay with until you're able to get your own place? A distant relative, friend or acquaintance? Your brother doesn't sound safe to live with. I know everything is a million times harder and more complicated because of covid, but there are still people in this world who care and want you to be okay, even if they've never met you. I hope that your situation improves. You can make it through this."
depression,fq479s0,t3_ggr7mo,1589074384.0,"I am so sorry you lost her. She was your baby, and you have every right to grieve her for as long as you need to. What you should keep in mind as you grieve, though, is that she had an amazing life with you. You loved her so much, and since she was passed down from your mother to you, she had many amazing years with both of you. Your time with her will always be etched in history, and hopefully you have a lot of videos and pictures of her, but even if not, sometimes the smallest memory can be a blessing. If you'd like to answer, where did she like to sleep? Did she have any favorite foods? Did she have any strange or funny quirks?"
depression,fq3x8br,t3_ggoh2k,1589071327.0,I can say without a doubt you deserve a fucking break. Humans are not naturally built to spend their entire lives working with no breaks for enjoyment.

depression,fq3ugsh,t3_ggi5p0,1589070416.0,"Im so sorry that people that were supposed to be there for you abandoned you when you needed them. You are not at fault here, at all. You were in enough pain to attempt to die, and while that wasn't a great thing to do, I understand the deep, crushing weight you must have been under. Life can be so goddamn difficult, and your family should understand that. The fact that they didn't come see you because they're embarassed of what you did fills me with rage. They should be there for you as your family. I'm glad at least your boyfriend is there for you, I hope that you're able to get through this together. I can't really say anything to improve your situation, but you are not the guilty party for feeling alone and wanting it to end. I hope that someday soon you find a reason to want to keep going and you can start to feel alive again. It's easier said than done, but you deserve that. Maybe someday you'll feel lucky that you didn't die. You may not know it yet, but maybe this is the beginning of your second chance."

I haven't listened to Arrivals & Departures, Rescue, I Am Alive or A Beautiful Place to Drown in full but here's a light ranking of the albums I know better 

1. Discovering the Waterfront (one of the best albums I've ever heard, every song is great. So glad I got to hear it live)
2. This is How the Wind Shifts (my new favorite, the first 2 songs set a fantastic tone)
3. When Broken is Easily Fixed (extremely hard hitting and nostalgic especially Red Light Pledge)
4. A Shipwreck in the Sand (haven't spent much time with this one but it's got many bangers
5. Dead Reflection (I love Afterglow, Retrogade and Aquamarine a lot, the lyrics are very emotional and poetic in this one)

I care about my friends and know they care about me but it's hard to open up about what's going on in my brain because I feel like they'll never really get it. I can't really give you any wise words or advice, but just know I feel empathy for you and I truly hope things get better. You may not believe it, but you have the potential to lead a great life.

When you are depressed your brain and body can feel too weak to get out of bed and be productive, and sometimes it's okay to just let that happen and rest for a while. It's good to try getting up and exercising/getting fresh air when you can, but try not to beat yourself up too much if you'd rather stay in bed some days. Just know that you deserve to take care of yourself and spending too much time in bed can deprive you of things that can provide you with seratonin.

You can message me if you're feeling this way, I know we don't know each other at all but it's probably cathartic to talk with people who feel the same way as you"

If I may ask a 2nd question, how did the dynamic of the group and your live performances change once you lost Aleksandra, Ellen and other founding members of the band?

Just wanna say as well how much I love y'all, you're a great group of people and I've seriously fallen for your music in the past few years.

I got out and my life has become so much more than how it started."" You deserve friends, and peace and happiness. I hope that you can get those things, but until you're able to get somewhere where you can be happy, you've got to continue to fight. You're so strong and I know you can make it.

ADTR fans tend to overrate the harder songs and turn away from the softer, more pop punk tracks, but some of them are really amazing"
Emo,f30wvb0,t1_f30iahr,1570563856.0,"It took me a while to come around to tracks like An Introduction to the Album, In Framing and Dendron but now I love them. It might just not be your thing? I think most people like it because of the poetic and hard hitting lyrics as well as the sheer weight/power of the instrumentals. Also the vocals of Christian Holden are extremely powerful. Maybe give it a few more listens in a different state of mind? Anyway I'm sorry it hasn't clicked with you, are there any other Hotelier releases you like?"

Just because you don't have kids doesn't mean your life has ANY less meaning. You have pets, a career, and a beautiful home (I love that picture!) You go on and live your life, and don't ever feel bad for not taking a huge risk for someone that never treated you half right. She got herself into this mess, now she has to deal with the consequences."
