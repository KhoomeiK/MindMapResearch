SuicideWatch,fm57k76,t1_fm4i6ex,1585767779.0,"mhmm, I see this was something that was fairly recent. I could imagine attempting to kill yourself would be an unsettling experience to look back on. I am wondering, do you have access to Advil right now and were you aware of a lethal dose of Advil at the time, to where you took that amount? If you do have access, I am curious if you would be willing to put the Advil somewhere where it might be hard to access, like in an inaccessible cupboard or in a different room?"
SuicideWatch,fm3ptne,t1_fm3oygy,1585732459.0,"Hi there,

I am going to go for the night. But if you want to chat more in the future, I will check this thread and respond as timely as I can. 

I am concerned about you, and I hear that everything accumulating with your depression right now has made it feel like ending your life is the only option. I am glad we were able to connect for a short time tonight. I am not sure where you live, but I have put resources for crisis lines for the UK, Canada and the USA, since you speak English. However, I encourage you to seek out other crisis support if none of these are where you live. 

Canada: [https://www.crisisservicescanada.ca/en/looking-for-local-resources-support/](https://www.crisisservicescanada.ca/en/looking-for-local-resources-support/)

USA: [https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/)

UK: [https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/suicide/](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/suicide/)

I care about you and I hope you are safe tonight. Take care.

I'm really glad you reached out. I'm hearing that you've been struggling to feel motivated, like everyday is an uphill battle.

I'm seeing that when you go through these moments of spacing out, you feel powerless to the situation and it makes it hard to ground, but cutting is something that has helped in the past. How long ago was this time you attempted?"

I understand that the desire to forget your past, and the feeling of being trapped, unsure of when those thoughts might go away, is something that is contributing to why you choked yourself tonight with a belt. I will be transparent with you that I am worried about you, and I am wondering, have you attempted to kill yourself in the past? I would really like to chat some more if you have some time. xo

SuicideWatch,fm3lute,t1_fm3l3lo,1585728179.0,"Hi there, 

Thank you for your reply, I am glad we are able to connect, and everything you're saying makes sense :) Yeah, I'm hearing that with the health crisis and you becoming more bored with having to stay in and where drawing and youtube aren't enough, the idea of cutting is something that can help you get through the night. 

I understand you're feeling numb, like it's hard to imagine what the future of coping looks like. 

I could imagine having the possibility of an episode evolving to the point where you may attempt again would be a frightening place to be. When you attempted last time, what was the means you used to attempt to end your life?

I see that you care deeply about your friends, and it feels like a betrayal for them to not be able to be there for you when you're describing your depression and suicidal thoughts with them. I can imagine that would be so disconnecting and since  they are a source of support for you, especially during this time of coronavirus, it can make it feel like there's no one to turn to. I could imagine being called toxic and manipulative would be really upsetting from people you trust.
