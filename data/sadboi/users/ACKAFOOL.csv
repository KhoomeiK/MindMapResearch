BipolarReddit,fl929vw,t3_fn746p,1584938725.0,"Unfortunately my situation silenced the voice holding on hope and though it did not feel accurate I started the valporic acid and antipsychotics.  Only the loss of insurance and the realization my odds of seizing were more than 0 i titrated and quit. Soon after I  began self administering my own medicine which was drugs and lucked out huge by essentially treating adhd for the first time with an effective dose. To shorten this lecture bullets.

In 6 months focused on mindfulness, breath and perfecting the practice of putting full focus on a task to the point of flow

: 10 lbs gained 
: alcoholism assesed as the obsessive response to questions not yet known as life long hurdles are removed as enlightenment prepares to free me.
: ciggarrttes also fade from the fixed position they have held as the lead in this meat sack to an extra understudy. 
: no more self debasement styled as an ego bump for the former friend fooled for years 
: he needed me to be alcoholic but the more I went with out it the more his use was on display. 
:  stood up for the abolishment of passive aggression and revealed to the matriarch of my decades long benefactors she was known to me. Knew she talked shit,  stole my sticks and then told my buddy she saw my sister and I engaged in incest.
He asked this of me the next day and I offered no response other than goodbye.  

So Bipolar 1 was okay to support no matter the amount of alcohol being used to survive because i was agreeable and codependent. 

Autism answered all questions I have been pondering per diem since I took on the State of my Union as a special interest round 16 or so."

TalkTherapy,fhabug0,t3_f1zf8q,1581403779.0,It is normal to fawn over someone providing an intimate relationship especially if your past provided partners that used your good nature.  You do not need to bring this up it just means you  two have reached a point in therapy trust will take over which could yield lasting results. Telling them may or may not change but I would wager if you told your therapist he would hit you with the above . Just understand that this is a perfectly normal reaction to another person showing you much needed compassion.  Return the favor by maintaining your part in the professional relationship.  Sometimes our brain farts and burps things that we should be able to see for what they are. I think you are fine either way as good therapists get this a lot. Means they are teaching people to love again.
