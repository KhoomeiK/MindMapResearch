edmproduction,fqzhe3n,t1_fqzg8px,1589767421.0,Word thanks for the advice man I just deleted the post cause so many people are just so negative I don't have the time to argue. Have a good one yo
edmproduction,fqzf00b,t1_fqzekfu,1589765980.0,Why is everyone taking that so literally. A LOT of artists deal with depression and anxiety. Don't need to say much more than that
edmproduction,fqzequg,t1_fqzco7v,1589765827.0,I feel that. Although I haven't heard many speak on that
edmproduction,fqzeo07,t1_fqzcf1g,1589765779.0,I've seen a lot of threads about it. And most producers I know personally have spoken about it as well as many popular artists. Obviously I wasn't being literal.
edmproduction,fqzejta,t1_fqzdma6,1589765708.0,Obviously i don't know everything. Nobody does.
edmproduction,fqz9dia,t3_glqm5g,1589762628.0,"I'm on Ableton 10 right now but I want Reason 11 super bad... The way your looking at it is bad but Fl Studio is a good beginner DAW but most people get sick of its workflow and switch. Wouldn't get Reaper unless you want to buy a bunch of 3rd party plugins and struggle finding youtube tutorials... If you only want to learn one DAW and stick to it I would go with Ableton, Reason, or Bitwig."
KratomKorner,fquejjm,t3_gkyi6c,1589657475.0,Ima just keep taking kratom until i can't anymore

edmproduction,fqqi3fv,t1_fqqho56,1589565902.0,I would agree
privacytoolsIO,fqos34g,t1_fqofjvy,1589523205.0,use a fake name fake email obviously

edmproduction,fqobjqk,t1_fqobgoa,1589511603.0,I feel you whatever works
edmproduction,fqobhr4,t1_fqnrm3f,1589511570.0,There’s some good plugins in Ableton still but yeah Logic has a lot more practical and high quality stuff. I really like Abletons plugins for sound design tho such as Erosion and the different distortions. The thing about Ableton is it’s super minimalist some people hate it for that but I just love how easy and quick it is to use for me
edmproduction,fqob6jf,t1_fqo4fiy,1589511380.0,They bought Camel audio a while ago
edmproduction,fqob22l,t1_fqnvi1b,1589511305.0,Yeah they’re really good but no reason to leave your daw over them when you can just copp a waves bundle on sale and stay in Ableton.. even for engineering I use Ableton I’ve tried to do the whole working in two daws thing and it’s just not for me
edmproduction,fqoaypc,t1_fqnlofi,1589511249.0,Yeah I can agree the plugins are really nice in Logic.. I’d say they are in Ableton too but I know what you mean. But for workflow and racks n stuff idk man. Plus m4l. Plus not being able to use Logic on Windows automatically makes it a no go for me. If Apple got their shit together with their laptops then maybe I’d be hear preaching Logic
edmproduction,fqney4t,t3_gjsngi,1589493642.0,Still prefer Ableton on Windows. But this does look like a well needed update. Will definitely be paying attention.
brave_browser,fqnbjhz,t3_gjq0m8,1589491947.0,Yes
kratom,fqnb9g9,t1_fqn0xry,1589491810.0,Glad you said this. Thought I was in the minority. Kratom tolerance is not a thing once it plateaus. For those using it for the therapeutic effects and not to get high it’s very effective long term.
edmproduction,fqmnci1,t1_fqmimpa,1589480314.0,As long as i can still find it online i dont care. It's perfect how it is in my eyes
SexAddiction,fqmhzag,t1_fqks7qm,1589477758.0,"I meant no ill will. I see now why my comment struck a nerve for some. The reason I called her out was because she was making excuses and not taking responsibility. I am new to this and wasn’t mindful of the fact that the first step is admitting you have a problem. While I don’t think the advice I gave was wrong, I see why it wasn’t called for at this moment. Read my responses to the other commenters. My hope is that I at least planted a seed that’ll help her realize that the blame should not be put on others for her own decisions. I strongly believe that."
SexAddiction,fqmgp82,t1_fqkhz56,1589477158.0,You are right. Except about the not being an addict part. I am an addict I just don’t struggle with cheating. I suppose this was a lack of empathy on my end. I will be more mindful in the future.
SexAddiction,fqmfg06,t1_fqki36b,1589476560.0,I worded it more passive aggressively than what was intended. It’s good you are getting help. I am new to this as well. I received help for drug addiction a while back and one of the things I did was steal money. I suppose it’s like someone telling me “I can never understand why drug addicts steal money.” Good luck on your journey.
edmproduction,fqkgrrg,t3_gj9zax,1589426960.0,This is exactly how I feel about CamelPhat3 it might be my favorite plugin of all time. I love it’s compressor and distortions and i have the most important knobs mapped to macros and saved as a rack so I pretty much never have to open up the GUI and therefore use it in the same way I would use Stock Ableton
kratom,fqh3o3y,t1_fqh2x92,1589366709.0,I’d check to see if it really contains enough to make a difference. Honestly who knows all the alkaloids n everything maybe it’s got something they haven’t found yet idk. But even something as simple as the difference between Jet Alert and Walmart brand caffeine makes a huge difference in effects for me. Like the difference between jittery anxiety and feeling fine even tho it’s the same mg
KratomKorner,fqg7zq6,t3_gidnuk,1589339941.0,Haha. Idk man kratoms like the only thing that doesn’t give me anxiety. Just chill and take it slow it took my body about a week to adjust to the wobbles and nausea so just give it a chance and it’ll help please be careful tho man id hate for you to end up addicted and having your anxiety worse. Find a daily regimen and stick to it
kratom,fqg6x15,t1_fqf3503,1589339274.0,So caffeine isn’t comparable with caffeine? Makes sense. Ofc effects will very based on mode of ingestion and dose but that’s about it
kratom,fqev9ka,t1_fqeuyva,1589314168.0,Gotcha
kratom,fqetu6o,t1_fqeo5m2,1589313491.0,I thought the caffeine in the cans comes directly from the Yerba? Source?
kratom,fqetguy,t1_fqdp9de,1589313317.0,Isn’t Yerba Matte just caffeine? I take caffeine pills now and drank Yerba over the summer but it fealt the same lmao

edmproduction,fqb7fz1,t3_ghukv1,1589231904.0,Automate a Utility. I never really gave it any more thought than that
synthrecipes,fqb767n,t3_ghq6g4,1589231769.0,Weird way of looking at it. If it sounds good it sounds good and the part you should be critical of is if it fits in the mix. A synth you may want to try for leads is Z3ta 2 it has a really creative and unique way of altering wavetables it’s SUPER old by cakewalk you’ll have to find it somewhere online but it’ll allow you to easily tweak your sounds and change the wave to something unique. Idk how to explain it you just gotta try it to get what I’m saying it’s become my go to synth for leads and plucks
edmproduction,fqb5xyw,t3_ght8ft,1589231154.0,"Lfo tool is great because you can save your Lfo shapes in Serum and then open the file in Lfotool and it will be the same shape plus you can also do sidechaining and all sorts of stuff with it. Autopan is way to choppy I find lfotool to be really smooth i really think it’s your best option it has the filter too that you can link to the lfo. 
Also there is I free filter plugin by Airwindows called Capacitator and it’s the cleanest auto filter plugin that exists in my opinion and it’s very light on cpu and does exactly what it’s supposed to and you could map the Max4live lfo to it if you have Ableton. Also I tend the put the plugins on each individual track as well as the group and it’ll be much cleaner... so yeah if your looking for a clean and fast filter to automate yourself go with Capacitator but if you need something with resonance and more freedom lfo tool is good and I think it has delay compensation"
privacytoolsIO,fqb51ln,t1_fqaj55s,1589230703.0,As compared to Google phones? Not saying they’re secure but they refused to allow governments to track people with the whole Covid 19 apps and put in their own that allows people to disable it as well as being in legal battles with the FBI over phone security. I would trust Apple much more than Android. Just my opinion.

That’s kind of why I asked this I wasn’t sure if I’m supposed to be selling once the halving or whatever tf happens. I know I probably sound dumb af rn but I’m so new to this haha.

kratom,fq2p9a7,t1_fq2n86d,1589058317.0,"There is one that I was reading up on that definitely has psychoactive effects that are reported to be similar. It’s just like Cannabis Sativa, Indica, and Ruderalis. They’re all considered different types of Weed even though Ruderalis barely has psychoactive effects. I know they generally aren’t called Kratom but arguably they could be and be marketed this way. I would imagine this would be a much more genuine use of the word strain but even Cannabis I guess they use the word strain as just marketing too whether it be Sativa Indica or Hybrid"

Anxiety,fq2a287,t1_fq1r445,1589054193.0,"Yeah just be careful. Doesn’t matter what people say. Weed is extremely psychologically addictive. Your brain will play tricks on you when you try to quit. It won’t be easy. You can quit for 2 weeks and next thing you know you’re texting your dealer thinking you’re doing nothing wrong. Don’t confuse a craving as free will. People hate me for saying it but that’s because they’re addicts idgaf. Yes, it is a fairly benign substance in that it won’t kill you. But it is not harmless. Dm me if you start having trouble. I’ve been through it with much harder drugs and have made it out the other side. I swear to fucking god if someone comments trying to argue with me about this (some retard always does) I’m gonna lose my shit. Btw Kratom is just as addictive if not more. It is 100% more physically addictive. Daily use will lead to much more unpleasant withdrawals if you ever decide to quit cold turkey. Only difference is it helps social anxiety if used responsibly instead of amplifying it like weed tends too. Take it understanding that you are allowing yourself to become to dependent on another substance. I would hate for me advice to lead you to having another addiction. Try quitting weed first. If your finding after a month or so its just too hard to bear not having a crutch, then consider the Kratom. Be smart, be safe. And don’t be that dumbass that starts taking Kratom and weed thinking they cancel out the negative effects of each other. FUCK that. I almost regret telling you about it. Just be safe bro. Please dm me if you have any questions at all. The best thing you can do is find a good therapist to keep your behaviors in check. I’m no therapist. I’m just some moron on reddit giving risky medical advice. But my intentions are good... I think. Maybe I just like hearing myself talk who knows honestly? Lol"
