MensLib,fr4nqkq,t1_fr3wgf7,1589893030.0,"Yes! It’s often easier to just do the task yourself at a certain point, rather than asking someone repeatedly when they are going to get around to it. Especially when the answer is “in a minute” or something like that, but the “minute” never comes. So you stop asking and do the task yourself but that doesn’t mean you’re happy about it. In cases like these, if your wife “won’t say what’s wrong” it’s because she’s already told you a thousand times and is sick of repeating herself. These are the types of relationships that don’t last because the man in this scenario doesn’t really want to know what’s wrong. It’s kind of similar to what someone else pointed out- that saying “let me know if you need help” can be an intentional dodging of responsibility. Asking “what’s wrong” when the situation repeats itself can be another way of shifting the blame for the problem at hand. Like the example the article pointed out, dinner needs to be made every night and then cleaned up afterward. So if you often rely on your wife to tell you how to help with this and then also rely on her to explain to you why she’s angry you didn’t, you’re headed for divorce and it’s your own fault."

Thank you for sharing your story, it’s so important for people to know these crisis pregnancy centers are out there disguised as actual abortion clinics and are actively trying to deceive you. I ended up at one during my first pregnancy and I didn’t know about them either. My experience wasn’t quite like yours, I only got a pregnancy test but I remember how “off” the whole experience felt, like the pro-life pamphlets in the waiting room. That was 14 years ago, I hadn’t even formed a political or personal opinion on abortion yet. I chose to continue that pregnancy (not due to their efforts, although I’m sure they’d like to think so) but my experience at the clinic made me look into the issue more and I became pretty fiercely pro-choice, I participated in pro-choice activism during my pregnancy and after (which surprised people, oddly enough). These places should not be allowed to operate like this, tricking women into continuing their pregnancies. It’s really horrifying."

ShitMomGroupsSay,fps1knp,t1_fprzwvl,1588865935.0,"Oh totally. Back when I was just suspicious of everything I totally identified as a skeptic so I know how people can misuse the word. I think I was still, in a sense, I just wasn’t always applying it to every belief uniformly. It helped to learn about the laws of logic and what logical fallacies were also. I think that should be taught early in schools, it’s pretty crucial for understanding why it’s logical to reach one conclusion over another, rather than what “makes sense to me”. 

And LOL at your last bit. Ya know, I can kind of understand why they might see it that way. Back when I was still in it, I ran into a lot of people who’d criticize me for not vaccinating but when you asked just a few simple questions, it was clear they didn’t know what they were talking about. They were right, yes. But they didn’t know why they were right and they were SO SURE about it. That kind of thing kept me stuck in my wrong mindset for awhile. Moral of the story: If you (general “you”) don’t fully understand something, don’t try to debate the other side. They’ll dig their heels in when they feel they’ve won the argument. Better just to make the information accessible and as easy to understand as possible. And to teach people how to think instead of what to think."

I was never a Wakefield fan- I never believed vaccines caused autism or anything like that. It was all “but WHAT IF...” kind of things.

Plenty of countries have practices like what you’ve described and it’s been proven to work. Like I mentioned before, the unnecessary and harmful interventions that became routine in the US for pregnancy and childbirth is what I’d consider a leading factor into mothers not trusting the medical community in general. The US is pretty far down the list when it comes to things like maternal and child mortality rates, we’re not doing so well. So in that sense, they’re right to question “the system”, they just take it too far in the opposite direction. Just because something is natural, doesn’t mean it’s better and the same is true for the opposite as well. There’s always some truth in the lie, ya know."
ShitMomGroupsSay,fpp6ffi,t1_fpp4zzz,1588796776.0,"I think a major flaw in human logic plays a part and that’s that it’s counter intuitive to most people to understand that your own experiences aren’t valid when considering information on a larger scale. Just because something “worked for you” doesn’t mean that’s the right course of action. We have scientific studies we can refer to to see how something will affect most people over longer periods of time but most of our human learning experience throughout our lives involve cause and effect on a personal level like, “touch the stove- it’s hot- don’t do it again”. So as far as how our brains work, it seems to make sense that if you give your kid vitamin C while they have a cold and they get better, you’ve done the correct thing.

I very much fell for the whole “natural is good/chemicals are bad” hype, it took a better understanding of chemistry to pull me out of that.

FundieSnark,fpee3eg,t1_fpdty38,1588545724.0,I see what they’re getting at here but how is this pronounced as a name??
crochet,fpeak2t,t1_fpe9p49,1588543661.0,"Thank you! It’s just a basic crochet sock pattern I altered slightly. Each color is 5 rows (not counting the heel), and I added the shell border to the top and made some pom poms for the toes. The colors I used (all Red Heart) are turqua, saffron, and amethyst. I can be more specific and write up a quick pattern if anyone wants for about a size 6 (my daughter’s size) but I couldn’t be specific for other sizes."

We’re not sure what breed she is exactly either."
