AskReddit,fprhy1k,t3_gexhgi,1588854604.0,"A few years ago I hooked up with this girl and decided to take her to her college class and stay until she was done. She took night classes. She had a class in the afternoon I took her too and during that time I went to the store and made dinner for us when she came back before her other class. 

I pick her up from her night class and she’s in the middle of a very serious mental breakdown and we got back to her apartment where she tried killing herself. I stayed there until 2 am when her parents could come get her and the next day I drove the 3 hours away to go with her to her psychiatrist intake appointment and make sure she was okay and make sure I stayed by her side. The next few days I drove the 3 hours to check in and make sure she was doing good. I took her to dinner and the movies and made sure she was happy.

A month later she ghosted me and a few months after I finally get to talk to her and she told me she didn’t need me she would’ve been fine herself and that all I did was make stuff more complicated. She said she was never going to hurt herself and did it to make me leave.

She was supposed to be just a hook up but sorry my feeling got in the way.."
