relationships,fkzayqu,t3_flebly,1584666790.0,"My dad is like this and always has been. To be honest, my mom and I always joke about it and we’ve come to the point where when he says that dinner will be ready at six, we know it’ll be 7:30. I think to some point you’re either going to have to realize that it’s who he is (your daughter will too) or make the decision to be more forceful in changing his habits. It’s difficult, I know. My dad missed out on a lot because of his timing. He would be doing work emails on vacation, on weekends, at the evenings. He only attended one concert, half a graduation, and all for what? It sucks. I wish my mom and him had the discussion before I was born and made it clear what he was expected to do. There’s no changing him though- we’ve tried. 

He should’ve apologized and recognized his wrongs. This is likely beyond a surface issue though. The thing I’d recommend to you is instead of going through this circle, ask him not to make promises like these. Make him set four alarms (30 min before, 15 min before, 5 min before, at time) for when it’s his turn to do things. Don’t expect immediate change. Just explain to him that if he is going to be late, then make it clear that he needs to explicitly say that to you and that he still has responsibilities regardless of his own schedule. Don’t take any bs, it’ll make it worse in the long run. If you want to talk or have any questions, reach out. Know that your husband isn’t a lost cause, he might change, just be patient (I know, I know, you’re already patient and feel you’ve run out of it). Find ways that he can show he loves you and your daughter that don’t revolve around a time. Best of luck to you."

I needed therapy because I was at my end and was only living because my two attempted times failed. I ended up breaking down in the car with my mum and after a few weeks I started therapy. To be honest, I’m not much better now, but I don’t want to die anymore and can laugh a little. My parents never asked me how I was doing or cared much. (Believe it or not, I’m originally from the UK but moved to the US when I was three.) I genuinely feel like I was in the same position. 

Don’t feel ashamed of your sexuality or emotional needs. It’s okay, just because your brother may have said he needed these things before you doesn’t make anything you need less valid and important. Have a talk with your parents- perhaps talk to them about therapy before coming out, that way you can have a professional help you through the family aspect of it all. Would you feel comfortable talking to your brother about any of this? He might be able to help.

Dealing with both feels lonely. When I’m in my darkest patches, I want someone to come over and sit across from me and watch tv with me. Maybe just stop by occasionally with some take out sushi or bring homemade soup or cook for her for dinner, even when she’s in a good mood. Make her feel cared about even when she’s in the best mood.

note- this is a personal preference, of course everyone is different. Consider asking if you can come over when she’s in a better mood on her down days so you don’t upset her."
