Some will try drugs because a friend suggested it would help their mental health and because they are in such a hopeless place, they will try anything.

confession,f9rr8uo,t3_e6loed,1575580164.0,"Hi, fellow psychotherapist here!

When I was still in my master's I had the belief that all I wanted to do was work with adults. I got a job working at a psychiatric emergency room and it was the worst thing I have ever done, I almost wanted to change career choices. I had anxiety thinking about work everyday. I always thought I would never want to work with children because I did not particularly feel like I could deal with kids because most of my friends are teachers and I observed the stress they were going through. I received a great offer working with children in an outpatient clinic and as hesitant as I was, it is the best choice I have ever made  (I still work there now). Sometimes a change in scenery will allow you fall in love with your job again.

Maybe taking a pay cut is better for your own sanity and mental health. Good luck to you!"

Because of the way she grew up, the odds were never in her favor but she beat them to the best of her ability and made it work. She could have been a drug addict or someone who refuses to work and just receive government assistance. Instead she enrolled herself in beauty school and is making a life for her self and her daughter. It would be better if there was less chaos around the baby in regards to her and Sean fighting, but I think she doing the best she can given the circumstances."

neighborsfromhell,f97mwew,t3_e483x4,1575167717.0,"I lived in a Co-op for 5 years and I had the worst experience ever. The lady downstairs would bang on my floor for normal noises that happened during the day/early evening. I was afraid to go to the bathroom after 11 PM because she would bang like crazy and complain to the super. Because I was the youngest one in the building to own an apartment, the super would call me and tell me to stop partying but in the 5 years I lived there, the most people I had in my apartment at 1 time was 2. I became anxious and miserable.

Your neighbor is following the rules, it's not a party or unreasonable weird noises, it's a television. Do you know the neighbor? What if they're elderly or hard of hearing and need the television volume that high? 

You can talk to your landlord but it's going off at a reasonable time. My advice is this, people cannot live in a multi person dwelling if they can't take noises. It's rude and unfair to complain about people who are enjoying their home and functioning within the home daily."
