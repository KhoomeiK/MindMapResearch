I'm an idiot who has worked for this guy for 9 years and he's taken advantage at every opportunity, while pulling that bullshit family line.

The fact that these business owners are saying that their employees would rather collect money than to work shows their attitude towards their employees.

Calgary,fn4ktpi,t1_fn4b9vd,1586643433.0,"I have used many different grocery delivery/grocery pick up services (for a few years).

Of all the ones I've tried Wal Mart and Instacart are the best. With Walmart you pick up, but they bring it out and you stay in your vehicle - the downside to this now is if anything you've ordered isn't avaliable you won't know until right before you pick up. They will try to replace your item with something similar but the last few orders I've placed close to half the items weren't avaliable at all. 

Instacart delivers right to you. They have service fees and tipping, but it's worth it because the person shopping messages you as they go so if something is out they'll ask you to approve a replacement or if you want something else entirely, and you can add things last minute. You do have to plan ahead with Instacart right now. I was able to place an order yesterday and the soonest delivery is April 15th, which isn't too bad. You can place your order, secure your delivery time, and continue to edit your order if needed.

Also, if you try to place an order with Instacart and it says there are no delivery time avaliable just keep checking back every few hours, something will open up."

Most people agree, everyone needs to get out and get some fresh air.

I complain about how many people are out, not because I think people shouldn't go out but because I'm seeing people stopping to chat, or people having to go up to other people when their off leash dog won't come when called, or all the neighbourhood kids still playing together, or high volumes of people just walking or jogging close together without stepping off the path onto the grass if someone is coming, or people on bikes passing people with like 2 feet between them.
