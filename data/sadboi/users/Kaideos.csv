pcmasterrace,fr443ir,t3_gmjw47,1589875122.0,"Ok, I'm assuming it's for gaming so here I go. GTX 1060 ($80-$100), i7 4770 ($120 used, $200 new, I suggest used cause there's no difference), 1TB HDD ($50-$60), any LED monitor ($50-$70), any motherboard that can fit all of your shit ($50-$60), processor's pasta for cooling ($5), keyboard and mouse ($15-$50), pc housing ($25-$50), power supply unit ($20). I think that's all of the components you can and need to buy if you are gonna build it. Keep in mind I'm not a professional and I maybe missed one or two parts essential for the pc to work even tho I think I didn't. Good luck building the pc. The *total of these parts is about $550*, so it's well under the budget.

Edit: I forgot RAM. 8GB would serve you for a long time. It's about $45."

I bought mine for 400 and it works fine, runs them all, but if I could, I would've waited for a $500 one. Pc gaming is great, you'll love it, I'm sure. One tip, buy an ssd. I'm sure u've heard of it, it's like a hard disk but much faster. Buy it, it's around 30-60 dollars and helps a LOT."

Fast forward to 8PM I was playing video games (on a playstation 1) and lights went out. The lights wouldn't come back untill somebody manualy fixed it. I was too short to reach it and didn't come up with the idea of getting a chair. I was so scared and it lasted for 1 hour, I was in the dark for a fricking hour. When my parents came home I was so relieved. Scariest experience ever by far."

Cops were called (so was the ambulance) and she was arrested and fired at the same time. She had a lot of complaints before that so she was on the verge of getting fired anyways.
