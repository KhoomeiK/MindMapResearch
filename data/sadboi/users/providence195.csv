depression,f7xtamt,t3_dxp0co,1574074364.0,I'm 32 and I'll be 33 in April.  I feel almost the same except video games and reading are still enjoyable.  I joined a book club that keeps me accountable and I go for a decent hike once a week that gets my blood flowing.  I can't help going to sleep soon after the sun goes down and waking up at 2am.  Right when I get up is the only time I feel interested in anything.  As the day wears on it devolves in to complete disinterest.
