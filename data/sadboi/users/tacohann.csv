AskMen,fqab9y2,t1_fqa41jq,1589216103.0,"my point was that for a man to say he also went through 9 months of pregnancy is not a valid argument for me, it's why I lashed out. i know there are kind men who help their spouses but a man can only help so much. from my point of view the woman is in it alone regardless in a way, because she is the one going through all the physical changes and hormones and all that. I don't wanna act as if a man doesn't have it hard with hormonal nervous woman in his life, but he just didn't go through a nine months of pregnancy. 

he was right about the else though, rushing doesn't help, the woman probably has issues with herself. 

I would be interested in your input."

I actually feel bad because I know men are told to suck it up all the time and I try to be careful. I was just triggered from all the posts I read before and he kinda discredited the woman in the scenario so I lashed out"

ZeroWaste,fprowjq,t1_fpr825r,1588859124.0,"oh you meant a special soap for shaving? I have never heard of it.. okay now I looked and they have it in my eco store but never noticed it before! haha since I have never looked into these things.. 

none of the brand's are available in my country unfortunately :( but thank you for taking your time and telling me about them.

badger is available here! cool :) oh haha that's complicated. everything has its pros and cons :( the horse alternative would be cool, but probably pretty pricey. since I bought the panties just a few days ago I will have to wait for any brush or another big purchase 😅

yes I'm definitely dedicated not to give up on it. will keep your advice in mind :) 

haha it's okay, tell me whatever you want 😁

i will take a look at my options and will let you know if find anything :)"

acturnips,fpq5kj7,t1_fppz3vp,1588815608.0,if you don't have an abundance of bells (im just beginning with turnips so I make about 200K from a trip via acturnips) i tip with NMTs. i always buy them when I have the task for miles where you get 200 back and then bring them to the host. so far no one has complained.
acturnips,fpq56yv,t1_fppuwjs,1588815396.0,I'm happy to hear visitors are tipping hosts even when they don't ask for anything. that's the energy I like hihi
acturnips,fpq4xe7,t1_fppptyo,1588815245.0,"I think it's okay to ask for something small, since the hosts have to put a lot of effort into the whole process. I have never hosted, but it seems like a lot of time-consuming work. I appreciate that always with a tips, but asking for that much is just ridiculous.. they want an arm and a leg"
ZeroWaste,fpq35a9,t1_fplo4as,1588814227.0,"haha that was just what I was browsing today! 😁 do you have any brush to recommend? :) I asked my mom and she has some bar soap she doesn't need (they arent conscious so they use liquid soap) so I will start with this, but already have chosen a lavender one 😁"
ZeroWaste,fpq2wez,t1_fplnzv3,1588814091.0,"hihi yes it is. the cup is amazing in theory. I'm so sad I haven't gotten used to it.

oh good answer haha, makes sense. I agree with the plastic, although our views may differ here, since I don't see a problem with plastic when it's used for a long term and you already have it. you probably already know about this, but I was in IKEA (well, last year) and they had glass boxes with bamboo lids I believe. that would probably fit your needs, won't it? also this is a plastic solution, but I store my blueberries in an old yoghurt cup and put that kinda reusable silicone lid on it. just a thought :)"
Korean,fpp6q95,t3_geixij,1588796924.0,"amazing idea! I like the design too. I would suggest explaining the terms in English too, so that Korean learners can understand more easily."
ZeroWaste,fplly1d,t1_fplkfiu,1588715103.0,"thanks for pointing me in the direction :) 

oh okay, I didn't know there were so many kinds! I am committed to lower my waste so the motivation is there, I just didn't think about being out of the shower when shaving. now there's no excuse 😁 haha the only swap I just couldn't get used to was menstrual cup (there were medical reasons too.. but I will get back to it one day) but I already bought period panties so I hope I can move on from this swap. what was the hardest swap for you I wonder? :)"
ZeroWaste,fpl4it2,t1_fpkys9a,1588706227.0,"hihi I don't shave my forearms, only armpits and legs. but trying it in a sink (by that I mean not the sink for hand washing but like a big bowl. is it called sink too?) and then moving in the shower standing is a good idea. I'm especially worried about the armpits. 

yes you are right :) no rushing 

yes that's good idea. I believe there may be a razor like that in my parents' house already and they don't use it, so that would be perfect. 

thanks for encouraging me. I will try to shave my calves sitting, I decided that just now 😁 haha have a great day!"
ariheads,fpia1kp,t1_fpi70az,1588636668.0,glad to hear she enjoys herself :)
ZeroWaste,fpi8nlg,t3_gdk6cc,1588635868.0,this is one of the switches I just can't bring myself to make. I'm terrified of slipping in the shower so this whole thing really terrifies me. just yesterday I was encouraging myself though to go ahead with it.. hopefully I will be brave enough soon
VeganZeroWaste,fpi86p3,t3_gd965a,1588635603.0,"yes. just today I was angry about this too. my mom (always praising herself for being very eco, although the reusable produce bags she bought lay untouched in the drawer and literally is bothered to recycle big enough plastic pieces.. kinda off topic lol sorry) took two single use plastic gloves when we were in a store. then she threw them in normal trash (I'm not sure if the very think plastic ones can be recycled but she didn't even gave it a thought) and when we went to another store she took new ones, but I kept mine because why not. I have how wasteful everyone is.. today at the store there were individually wrapped donuts in a plastic bags and there were like 30 of them. I understand the hygiene aspect and get it but it still makes me really sad"

menstrualcups,fpi551a,t1_fpi4jmg,1588633856.0,oh good! :) I'm relieved
menstrualcups,fpi52fp,t1_fpi4h6y,1588633815.0,they raised the price of other products because of that?! that makes me upset :( like I understand with higher end cups you pay for the brand and technology and research and what else but where are the 30 dollars in this.. instead of helping women to find their way to reusable products they make it about money. sorry about the ranting but I just feel sorry for everyone who can't buy a cheap cup to see if it's their thing when even the most basic one is that price..
menstrualcups,fpi4dyk,t1_fpgxdki,1588633429.0,so it can be touched without buying it? that's odd that it's not protected from touching by strangers
menstrualcups,fpi49m4,t1_fph2fev,1588633362.0,is there something else protecting the cup beside the pink flaps? like a clear plastic? as much as I hate single use plastic I wouldn't buy a cup that can be touched in the store and the cup seems to me to be uncovered
menstrualcups,fpi42ob,t3_gdemaf,1588633255.0,wtf is that price? that's ridiculous. I bought a generic rossmann branded one when I was starting out and it was 8 bucks. for 30 dollars you can get some proper one here where I live
NintendoSwitch,fpi35tf,t1_fpf08a1,1588632745.0,"yes, if you noticed I also expressed basically the same opinion as you and many others, but I wasn't a dick about it. like saying ""it's shit"" is just rude, regardless if you are an artist or not or whatever.. but especially when people commenting here can't do half the job he did but talk shit about it, that's what I have the issue with. what about constructive criticism? no, let's downvote people who think it's good and let's be an ass about someone learning something. op just deserves better"

my parents are very controlling and your may be too assuming from this post (of course I may be mistaken and I sure hope so) and you need to stand up for yourself. you need to show them you are the one deciding things regarding your body. their behaviour won't go away on its own"
NintendoSwitch,fpbct9z,t1_fpba63k,1588467084.0,"i just wanna say that the design itself is amazing and although the result is not ideal, it's still better than what those who ramble how bad it is would be able to do. I think it's pretty cool especially given its your first attempt

Korean,fp29udn,t1_fp291mg,1588257961.0,"you are twisting my words. I did not say it was ignorant of you to say that she should not use translator, it was ignorant of you to tell op to just write what op says, which you did. 

I see your point in other things and I agree. I just didn't like that you acted as if her issue wasn't issue at all.

good forcing yourself worked for you, but it may not for others.

Korean,fp1my8z,t1_fp0ebo7,1588241126.0,"op pointed out that spelling is an issue. korean has many assimilations, sometimes it's just pronounced a certain way and written other way (I can't come up with any example for this since I just woke up but I tend to misheard 오 and 우 in some words), the syllables sometimes have ""blank space.. ㅇ"" where another consonant could be (알아요 for example, to me it would make naturally sense to be 아라요, so when I started it was confusing for me), that could also be confusing when writing. sometimes people struggle with hearing 오/어 or may confuse ㄲ and ㅋ and other consonants, then there's ㅔ/ㅐ. it's not like you can speak a language and automatically know how to write and read too. there three are separated skills. it's not as easy as you learn one and automatically know other too. op tried to explain to you but you were pretty ignorant in saying that's op should just ""write what op says"", it just doesn't work like that."
