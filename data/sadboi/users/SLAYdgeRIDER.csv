Amd,fm0i4iu,t1_flzwpxm,1585658395.0,"Hey, I have a Helios 300 from 2017 and it is the one thing I regret buying all my life.

To start with, I had to buy the $900 version but for it to be available in my country, I had to pay $1.4K. The offer stated 2-year warranty, turns out only in the US. So pay more money if you're not in the US, but get half the warranty. And if you need warranty, pay even more!

The default thermal paste sucked, so I went to the CS to get it repasted, and the people didn't even know why. When I told them my temps were bad they were like it's fine. We're talking 95C here.

Their repasting was horrible, I came back home and repasted it myself almost immediately using a Noctua thermal paste.

So here's what you do after buying a Predator laptop.

1. Re-paste the thermal paste
2. Undervolt your CPU and GPU
3. Use a cooling pad
4. if your thermals still suck, then cry about it
5. regret your purchase and build a PC next time!"
