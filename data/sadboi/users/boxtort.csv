It wasn‚Äôt as charming as TS2, sure, but unlike in TS4, the PACKS WERE ACTUALLY WORTH THE MONEY and the OPEN WORLD WAS INCREDIBLE and the TRAITS ACTUALLY AFFECTED GAMEPLAY and the CUSTOMIZATION IN CAS AND BUILD MODE WAS SO DETAILED. The endless possibilities! 

I actually hated it when it first came out bc it was so different from TS2 and not as funny, but it only took me a few weeks to grow to fully appreciate it. I was hoping I‚Äôd warm up to TS4 the same way I warmed up to TS3, but, although I‚Äôve gotten more used to it... I still miss the TS3 so much ;~;

Will someone buy me a computer that‚Äôs capable of running it again? My old Mac desktop computer died. All I have is an HP laptop. Is there something I can do to make it work, like an external drive or something? I play TS2 ultimate collection on it since that‚Äôs all it‚Äôs capable of running. Where‚Äôs Mr. Humble when you need him?

Also, shout out to the original Sims, which was absolutely hilarious and creative. Makin‚Äô Magic was one of the best packs ever. The Sims is the bare essence of everything that‚Äôs great about the game without all the bells and whistles. That raw humor is what we all appreciate about TS and TS2."
