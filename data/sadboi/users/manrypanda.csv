EatingDisorders,fqk9nqj,t1_fqj50vp,1589422846.0,"When looking for resources/media I highly recommend choosing sources that are clinicians or researchers as they're more likely to have evidence-based recommendations.

Some of the videos I'm recommending have a spiritual inclination (none are dogmatic).  Mindfulness has been supported by numerous studies as a means of improving self-regulation.  I've found it very helpful with binging.

**Podcasts:**

Let me know if you have any questions!"
EatingDisorders,fqhyeor,t1_fqh2ado,1589386747.0,"Rephrasing the above:

Talking to her from a place of love, support, and curiosity (rather than judgment) is extremely important.  It sounds like she has a lot of shame around eating and her behavior.  If she could have stopped by now she would have.  

Curious Supportive Questions: 

* ""I see you're hurting - How can I best support you?""
* ""I love you and want to support you, what would be helpful to you?""
* ""I was thinking of going on a walk with the kids, would you like to join us?""

As the above commenter mentioned it is important she takes ownership of her own health and healing.  If online therapy isn't an option there are excellent books/podcasts/youtube videos on letting go of binging behaviors.  The resources are out there if she wants them.

Developing skills to manage mood/anxiety and slowing down prior to binging (even if it's a brief pause) is crucial.  She has been in this cycle for a long time and will need to take it day by day (and at times moment by moment).

In agreement with the other replies, this work is for her to do.  She needs to want it and commit to it.  She's lucky to have you in her corner but ultimately she's the one in the ring.  

Be kind to yourself during this process, it's hard to see a loved one hurt themselves."

I found it SUPER helpful when doing my class schedule so I could pick professors who were really organized (getting grades back late makes me very anxious) and who had reputations for caring for the students.  

A good professor can really make or break a class."
aspergirls,fiivco7,t3_f7nvku,1582427824.0,"I save my joking for friends who know and trust that I'm a kind person.  That way even if the joke gets horribly misinterpreted it's not damaging to the relationship long term.  

With acquaintances/colleagues/people who know me casually, I hold back on jokes - especially when they are comments on people/their behavior.

Talking/joking about others (even in a joking/playful/witty way) can make them feel self-conscious.  It's not necessary.

I've found focusing on expressing the fondness I feel for the people has gotten me a lot further than playful jabbing.  I've even made friends through this who I can later joke with!"
aspergirls,fiit465,t3_f7jydt,1582426249.0,"I was extremely challenged by deficits related to my Aspergers diagnosis (severe social anxiety, depression, panic attacks, etc) and as a result, my path was different.  I went to community college, struggled through different jobs, and worked on myself both independently and with a therapist.

While I'm a couple of years ""behind"" my peers I'm happy to be where I am.  I attend university, work, and have made a couple of close friends.  Without having done the ""work"" (introspection, self-acceptance/compassion, and self-care) I would not be where I am today.

I will always be a woman on the spectrum: sensitive, quirky, and at times a little awkward.  Fortunately **by accepting that all I can do is my best and that my best is enough;** my life has become more beautiful than I could have ever imagined."

I really tried to go without it initially since I managed to go a whole semester without it being an issue but it has definitely become a problem.  

Interestingly there are 1-2 classes that I do not have a ""seat"" in as I never get there in time and have always had to pick a new seat each time.  Unsurprisingly they're my least rigorous classes so I'm less stressed to begin with."

EatingDisorders,fecqsj3,t3_eo7lfm,1578981178.0,So sorry to hear you're going through this without support of your parents.  I remember how painful it was when I started as a teen - sending you a lot of love.  Legally your parents are required to provide you with medical care as its neglect otherwise.  This includes mental health care - an eating disorder is a serious condition and you deserve support.  I highly recommend reaching out to a counselor at school or your general practitioner as they can help you make the case for you getting a therapist.
