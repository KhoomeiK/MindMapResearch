But I still feel low level distress, just like you said. To me it feels like going down on an elevator or a road downhill that's been poorly engineered and you can feel low gravity for a bit. The low anxiety creates a vacuum like feeling in my chest. I thought about it and I think it's fear.

It is generally easier to get a guy off than a girl, and I'm not talking about the quality of orgasm, I'm just talking about whether it is or isn't happening. I want to accent the word generally, because when we learn something for the first time, it helps us to understand what is statistically normal and work from there on our individual adjustments. So I think that it is partially the girl's fault for not communicating what she wants, but we need to talk about whose fault is it that she a) doesn't know how her body works, b) isn't confident enough to tell the person she got undressed for that she doesn't like something and would like things done differently."

As many of you wrote, I also have a toxic family. Sometimes I feel awful thinking like that about them, because my mother guilt tripped me so that I fight every critical thought I get about them and I actually have to rely on my partners and friends who met them to assure me that they are weird. Anyway, I met this absolutely dream perfect family (it turned out that they were a bit too perfect and their daughter didn't handle the academic and general success pressure, but they adjusted to the situation very quick and helped her immediately) and I wish I was a better daughter back then. I wish I talked and acted differently, I wish I wasn't so freaking materialistic and cheap at the same time and didn't put myself in such awkward positions. I wish I paid more attention to them and to spending more time with them instead of in my room on the computer. I wish I wasn't so lazy, so, so lazy back then, because they live in one of the most beautiful places on Earth, where just going on driveway constitutes as a hike.

BPD,flmtury,t3_fpsdud,1585296405.0,"So I've posted this a week ago on my profile with the title 'Sex with BPD' and I'll just paste it here with few adjustments. I'd like to say upfront that I've had disgusting intrusive thoughts since I can remember. On the other hand some part of me wants sex constantly, loves it and needs it, but it's so hard to convince my head and body to listen and allow me to relax. 

I've never been abused, thank god, yet sex has always been a very difficult part of my life. I lost my virginity to my first boyfriend at the age 16, but the basic sex hurt most of the time and other forms of it weren't satisfying either. Then I dated another guy for three years and it was slightly better, but only from time to time and it was nothing strange to have 2 month pauses between sessions, because I wasn't in the mood. I cheated on this guy, I had such low self esteem that I behaved like a giant piece of trash. I continued sleeping around after I broke up  with him, that was the longest (6 months) period of me being single since 16. I thought I was boosting my ego, I was trying to convince myself that I'm enjoying this life, while I wasn't at all. In contrary, it all added up to the problems I already had. Right now I'm in much better place. I met a guy 2 years ago whom I've been with since. He was a virgin (vs me having had slept with about 12 men and experimented with several women) and I took it very slow with him at the beginning to make him comfortable and relaxed. We had sex after about 3-4 weeks of dating and this period of going slow and getting to know each other helped me as much as him. The problems are not gone, though. I enjoy sex most of the time we have it and when I enjoy it, I really do enjoy it, because my bf tends to me with very patient care. But I still have bad moments, I turn down sex a lot, I'm in the mood maybe 2 days in a month when we're lucky. Most of the times I get set back by my insecurities, by intrusive thoughts or an overall numbness when I'm depressed, which happens quite often. I'm still glad things are much better than they used to be, but I still need to do a bit better for my boyfriend's sake. He's so kind and patient and loving, he never put any pressure on me - I'm good at doing that myself, but I know that this is not a healthy sexual relationship. He has needs that are being met mostly in the shower by his own hand and I have them too, it's just this giant barricade in my head that stops them from expressing.

I'd like to add that before my current boyfriend I didn't have problem with graphic sexual content and now I can't handle vanilla porn. I don't watch it deliberately, but it sometimes pops up in an ad on those tv shows streaming sites and I get the image firmly imprinted in my head."

This might be a good topic for debate too, because we could talk about whether it's even comparable, since men can orgasm from bad sex while women can't and what is the value of such orgasm (probably not much). You mentioned going down, so lets compare it with a blowjob, or even better, an anal (I love blowjobs, can't even think of anal, gross). A lot of women can't orgasm from penetration only, while most men can. Women demand long foreplay, going down and other stuff to even get to the orgasm that's somewhat granted to men. Blowjob, anal, many other stuff is just something extra to the base men already have, while for most women ""demanding the extra stuff"" is actually to meet their basic needs. But again, we could also debate about the quality of orgasm and whether it's a blessing or a curse for men to be able to orgasm from bad and mediocre sex, or even rape, which is definitely a curse, because it must make it hard to even grasp the idea (both for the rapist and the victim) that it was a violent act."

It might help you both to find coping mechanisms for certain situations. I really wish to give you some brilliant advice, because what you wrote down sounds way too familiar. My partner hasn't reached the point where he'd start rethinking the relationship, but it's inevitable if things don't get better with me and I keep throwing tantrums over things that don't objectively matter. Does your state allow you to take care of yourself a bit? Cut down sugar, drink lemon balm tea regularly, take valerian drops, go for a massage, give yourself a massage or a good bath...I can't take proper care of myself, but maybe if you could, things would get a bit better? Focus on self care? I don't know...I just feel sorry for you and there wasn't any comment here yet and I wanted to show at least some support, but it's kind of as is one disabled person told another to suck it up and run. I don't know how dependent you are on your partner and relationship, but since you have BPD I can guess a lot. So maybe you should pay extra attention and emphasize the moments when you are better. Use this time to care for him, to explain that you hate this sickness and all its manifestations (like the tantrums for example) as much as him, probably more since you live with it."
BPD,fkg4a0x,t1_fkg3nu9,1584149574.0,"You seem so at peace with it now. He doesn't watch it every day. He even says that it was me who motivated him to do it less and less, last time according to him was month or two ago. It's embarassing to talk about it since it is not objectively a big deal (unlike your case, that's bad objectively and subjectively both), but I can't stop these feelings. I'm not gonna lie, my fucked up head seriously considers it as a reason to break it up. He's suffering in this relationship anyway"
BPD,fkg2ep6,t1_fkg1zpe,1584148272.0,"Are you still with him? Did you work it out? I know communication is the key, it's just that I hate myself so much that I project this on him and I have no idea how to cope. The reasonable conversation we have one day that I'm fine, means nothing the next day when I feel like shit"
BPD,fkg1gd7,t1_fkg0w8i,1584147600.0,"I'm so sorry that this happened to you, it honestly sounds horrible. Now I feel bad that I flipped over a really minor thing and desperate that I still can't stop flipping over it, you probably know the spiral. But what you're describing sounds really awful, I'm so sorry. I mean especially since you are probably much more sensitive than an average person."
BPD,fkg11pv,t1_fkg0aaf,1584147314.0,"I'm sorry, but I don't accept it. I don't care that other men watch porn, but I made it clear that I personally hate it. I'm anxious about it and he knew that. Not only because of my self esteem, but also because of the way it usually depicts women and I don't care how much they get paid. It tends to be violent and scary and disgusting. And even if this is all just in my head, the point is that he knew, yet he still convinced me several times not to condemn this relationship and promised to take care of my needs and he broke this promise."
BPD,fkbypcm,t1_fkahrik,1584042425.0,"I think I know that you are right and the little dates sound actually tempting, but in my mind it goes something like this: If he suggested that he needs time for himself to just relax outside of the relationship, I'd go crazy, because suddenly something wouldn't be just about me. And since I don't want this thing to be done to me, I don't allow myself to do it."
BPD,fka8yk7,t3_fha4o9,1583997179.0,"Is there a possibility to go to a couples therapy? Maybe working on some rules and boundaries would work. I know it's hard, though, because people with BPD don't think straight during their breakdowns, at least I don't. I told my bf to just hold me and comfort me and be there for me when I get it, but then I start pushing him away anyway. We haven't gone to a therapy together, though, but he suggested it. Maybe a therapist would work with you on some coping mechanisms, teach multiple tricks how to handle the situation. To be honest, it's so scary to see a post like this from a perspective of someone with the disorder, but that makes it double great that you asked ""the other side"". Btw I have an urge to show this to my bf to guilt trip him into not ever leaving me."
depression,fka8fkz,t3_fh6mko,1583996550.0,"It's already been said here, first of all you were a young kid who didn't know anything and second, you've been hurt yourself and hirt people really do hurt other people. You were a child and you didn't have the capacity to think it through better. What's really important, you didn't persist in this behavior to adulthood like some other scums."
BPD,fka7xti,t1_fk9lapc,1583995972.0,"Thank you for your advices. I talk to him I try to convince him to read some literature about BPD partners and how to deal with them, it's just that I feel guilty for shifting my responsibility to get better to him. He is very loving and supportive, but for how long? We're young, so how long before he gets tired of me and my fits? I hate myself so much and I hate him for my own fear of him leaving me"
BPD,fk6t4sv,t3_fgmofh,1583915004.0,"I imagine that every personal experience like thoughts, feelings or reactions lies on an axis that goes from extremely low intensity to extremely high intensity. And on each of these axes there is an interval of normality. This interval has fluid borders, because its not possible to define normality precisely. I think that BPD person doesn't fit in this interval and goes extreme either way. For example me, I've been diagnosed with mild personality disorder and I can see that I am only a bit over the edges, but still clearly not inside the normality interval. I remember how my therapist was telling me all over again that the way I perceive bad things happening in the world, like natural catastrophies, hunger, unequality, violence, world leaders incompetence, human greed, etc, is not normal and I didn't understand. I asked him how do other people perceive these things then, since they  are generally serious and grave problems. He replied that it's a good question and basically told me that it's a matter of intensity and time. Eg if a normal person reads news about Amazon forests disappearing, they get angry and shake their head, but move on quickly. It's not like they dismiss the problem, they just don't obsess about it constantly like me. Sorry, I made the comment all about me, partially because of the need to share, but I also wanted to show on an example."
BPD,fk4t045,t1_fk4sece,1583867006.0,"It makes sense, because someone finally found words to describe my/our complex problems, but then I start analyzing why it's happening and the sense gets lost again. The worst feeling is that hopelessnes after I realize that naming my problems doesn't help solving them."
BPD,fk4qxz6,t3_fgh8zj,1583865857.0,"How is it possible that all this is so personally relatable? A lot of posts in this group actually. Such detailed troubling thoughts and emotions and tons of us share them..I was thinking, since a lot of us don't have proper sense of our identity, maybe this is our collective identity, haha"
BPD,fk16h1e,t3_ffoc4l,1583773375.0,"I know exactly what you're talking about. I was a fat extrovert goth girl (but nooo expensive outfits, just old rags from second hands) in high school, then I tried to be a cool, spendy, fashionable girl, that was late in high school and early in college, then I went through a phase of bulimia, lost weight and switched to city girl style and right now I'm a hippie pot head. And I'm not even talking about copying so many people and fictional characters from books and movies. Is it because we don't have a proper sense of our identity? I seriously have no idea who I am."
