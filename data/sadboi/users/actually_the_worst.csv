The show was ""The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee,"" and I don't know if you're familiar with it, but I played Olive Ostrovsky. She has a song called, ""The I Love You Song."" The first time I even read the lyrics, I cried. In this song, Olive is given the word ""chimerical"" to spell. It means, ""highly unrealistic,"" and ""wildly fanciful."" Upon hearing the definition, Olive begins imagining her parents. Her mother, who left her, presumably after an affair, and her father, who never supports her and is always at work.

Olive imagines her parents telling her that they love her. Through the song we realize that Olive's idea of something ""wildly fanciful and highly unrealistic"" is both of her parents openly expressing their love for her.

When I got the role of Olive, I hoped it would help me express that I believe the same thing--that a parent's love is just a fantastic dream.

Hearing a congratulations from any mother is more than I've gotten from mine.

Thank you, so, so much."

helpmecope,f104bzp,t1_f0zpr95,1569107146.0,"I'd hope to be put on medication, or at least understand my condition because people around me do point out that I am flawed because I'm afraid to do mundane tasks. A friend of mine told me that when she was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, she was given medicine and therapy and has since been doing much better, she says she feels like the world isn't against her anymore. I appreciate you telling me that maybe my mother is just overwhelmed, but I do wish she'd do more than essentially say, ""get over it,"" and ""you don't need medicine,"" because sometimes it's tough to deal with on my own, I'm sure you understand. But again thank you"
