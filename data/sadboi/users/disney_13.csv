relationship_advice,fn08824,t3_fyhek9,1586537198.0,"You should have a space where your family can stay if needed as well as your boyfriend's family. Your son should be welcomed to stay and enjoy the time of making him his own space and buying his favorite snacks. I would say that it is a deal breaker if your boyfriend cannot accept your son as his own and welcome him into your home. There are plenty of men out there that will step up and welcome your kids as their own. I would be direct as possible. If your boyfriend is still resentful it may cause your children to have negative feelings towards him which would worsen the situation. If you do move on, have a conversation early on in the dating process about your children and them being able to stay with you whenever needed. They may be ""adults"" but they are not 30 years old. They need time at home to get a hold of their own finances and to save for a house, etc. Goodluck!"

Advice,fjzxn3i,t3_ffp6l3,1583733002.0,"I would try talking to them again and if it doesn't improve, I would move all of your kitchen items into your own room. 

Try approaching the conversation in a different manner than the first time. If it was a light-hearted conversation, use a more serious tone. If it was too serious, try turning into something friendlier. Ask them why they don't want to do the dishes and ask them what would make it easier for them to do them. Try framing it as a way to make their lives easier and you might get a better response.

If this fails, take all of your items to your room.

Goodluck!!!"

careerguidance,ewqjwxz,t3_cplbxs,1565668154.0,"Bring your favorite beverage to make at the office like tea or coffee. Treat yourself with more extravagant lunches. Use a heated blanket or pillow at your chair if you are allowed so you are more comfortable. Add some personal touches to your desk space such as photos of happy memories. Remember to take breaks during the work day like washing your hands with warm water for five minutes can give you a pick me up. Consider listening to calming music while working. If you have had a stressful day make sure to do something rewarding after each work day. 

If you are still feeling unsure I would consider applying to other jobs. And before you accept a new one ask to get a tour of where you would be working and to see a typical work day in action and to meet your future co-workers that way you can see if the different environment will be beneficial. Not all jobs are that stressful (developer) so you could find something less hectic especially like working for the stage government."

Turn on mood lights or candles and put on your favorite show or a movie to watch. Make food you are craving or really like and bake cookies or something sweet. Hot showers help a lot and heating pads also help. Pregnancy pillows make great cuddle pillows. Create your space as a safe haven and invest in a new hobby you can do in your spare time. Self massages also help and there are automatic massagers you can buy at bed bath and beyond. Also crying sessions help relieve tension so if you feel it coming on you should let it out.

ParanormalEncounters,esjpr30,t3_c82wnu,1562038731.0,"Another time I had made a handmade board and decided to play with my grandma in her house. The board was moving very actively and was telling us that it was my dead grandfather. It was not the husband of the grandma playing. It was giving specific information about my grandfather. My grandma would not mess around with something like that as the passing was still recent. However, I believe it could have been another entity pretending to be him as it did not feel positive. Had later learned that there are prayers and candles that need to be lit in order to stay safe playing the board. A closing goodbye and prayer also needs to be said according to a local woman at a Wiccan store."
ParanormalEncounters,esjpdbg,t3_c82wnu,1562038463.0,"When I was younger my parents had gone out of town for the weekend. I was able to have a group of friends sleepover and we decided to play with Ouija board I had been give by another friend. We were jockingly playing it and had decided to play a card game after that. I went in the kitchen to get a drink and I saw a figure of a woman in white but only her top half pass through the kitchen. I told everyone what happened and one of the guys said he saw her too. We left for the night terrified. We all went back to the house in the daytime and during the day the guy who said he saw her also said that he saw a little boy in the house. I didn't believe it at the time but I was home alone three months later and felt a tap on my shoulder and a tug on my pants. Out of the corner of my eye I saw the little boy. I had gone on to seen the lady in white on multiple occasions after that. Ever since playing the board, I felt a negative presence in the house and more spirits were occasionally seen. It was to the point where I couldn't be alone in the house anymore. I believe the board opened a connection to other spirits within the house. Even friends would notice the energy. I would be sitting on the couch and would feel someone enter the room. My skeptic parent would hear footsteps in the middle of the night and would hear sounds of the cabinets opening and closing. He became a believer. Eventually moved out of the house with my family and the energy has not followed."

One night at an ex boyfriend's, it was my first night alone without him in the house. I was in his room getting ready for bed and heard a ""hey"" in a male voice unrecognizable. I then eventually fell asleep and had sleep paralysis for the first and only time ever with a tall black demon like figure at the edge of the bed with a choking feeling until in my sleep paralysis I crawled down the stairs and opened the front door of the house. All very realistic, nothing about the house was different. I woke up as soon as I opened the front door."
