TooAfraidToAsk,fqvf4dn,t1_fqv9nch,1589675945.0,"I don’t necessarily know what to do, but I can at least explain the reason why there are the dirty looks.

You talk about the invisible illness. So in this paragraph I will explain why even if people are aware of invisible illnesses, they will still not assume there is a valid reason for no mask. So, it is bc the number of people without a mask does not correlate with the number of people with these health conditions, especially considering the people with these conditions are especially supposed to be staying home. While not every single person has that privilege (this would be you), it is reasonable for the average person to assume that for the 1 out of 5 people aren’t wearing a mask in a grocery store (that’s the number I see, including those with their nose hanging out or something), that every single person in that group have severe medical conditions that inhibit them from breathing through a few layers of fabric. It’s probably much more likely to assume that 1% of those people have such a severe medical condition AND are out and about. I am so grateful you are strong enough to keep going out even though you really should have someone do it for you. I hope you will get proper support soon.

The other flip side is that people are giving dirty looks is for people who have health conditions like you. There is societal pressure to “suck it up” and wear a mask. I have not seen friends in months, am losing a ton of money, just like everyone else, for the healthcare system and for those at risk from dying. People giving you dirty looks are doing it in good faith, and there’s honestly no other way to non-verbally communicate, “Stop being selfish and wear a mask!” I not afraid of the virus personally (in terms of me getting sick). But I lost both my parents before 10. My uncle took me in and is now my only parent I know. He currently has two different types of cancer and is over 60. My time with him will be cut short if he gets sick. He doesn’t care about dying either, having faced death many times. But I’m only 21, and I just want to at least have him see me graduate college, even though my biological parents couldn’t. One more year isn’t too much to ask for, right? World says wrong. When I tell someone to turn around, I don’t care about me. I care about everyone else, whether I know them or not.

Also, Karen’s don’t want you to wear a mask - they want you to take it off. See: Red Lobster Lady, Twitter fight with Costco, the millions of people protesting it’s their constitutional right to touch up their roots... lol. They are the selfish people who don’t know what life is worth.

Also, to be frank, your last sentence is a fallacy. Potatoes are considered vegetables, but that does not mean they are good for you! (Obviously they are, in moderation.) Masks are considered PPE, but the ones that we wear around now (exception being N-95 masks, etc. that are designed to filter through) are actually worn for the protection of others and have little effect on helping yourself. The ones being worn around now are the same ones surgeons wear so that they don’t hurt their patient with possible contamination from, say, their saliva that they project as they speak. 

I compare this whole scenario to WWII. When we got involved, the whole country went on rations. Everything went towards the war effort. Wouldn’t you be pretty fucking pissed if you were on rations for a world war, and then some person came in and took a ton of food? Even if you were doing fine and wasn’t hungry at all?There might be a reason, why they took a ton of food, but everyone is making a sacrifice in some way, and it’s a dishonor when there is unjust exceptions made. And quite frankly, in this pandemic there are plenty of unjust exceptions being made - people protesting quarantine so they can go out and shit, while people are literally *dying* and healthcare workers are *sacrificing themselves more than ever*. My school now has part of its dorms reserved for healthcare workers bc they can’t go home to see their families. Imagine leaving your house, your family, and a long day of work and you have to sleep in a college dorm? And then some people can’t bother to just stay inside or wear a mask? Outrageous.

So that’s my really long explanation. I’m sorry for that, but I wanted to be clear. I truly understand about the invisible illness - I got a bunch of mental health issues and it makes me pretty different (to say the least) sometimes. But you got to have a strong foundation within yourself and remain in solidarity that you’re doing your best. Easier said than done!!

Given that you still have to go out, I can only think of one solution. Still broadcasts, but it’s vague. If you were comfortable with this - but only if you feel comfortable - you could wear a shirt or something that says “KEEP DISTANCE - health condition makes me unable to wear mask”. That would probably stop glares. I don’t think you have to do that, and people *should be* respecting your distance anyway. But if you were really feeling uncomfortable, it’s worth a shot.

Also, get that note from your doctor. HIPPA laws state that you are entitled to your medical privacy. The Karens will not find out. Keep the doctors note if you need it, but for all intensive purposes you do not need to tell anyone, ever your medical business!"

adhd_anxiety,fqv4zvg,t3_gkxsw3,1589669984.0,"I would take this video with a grain of salt. I went undiagnosed until about a year ago. 20 years. I was number 6 in my class of ~120, I got several awards, got into a really good school, and I now live off campus and basically manage my whole life myself.

How did I get through? Well I now know I hyperfocus on science, math, and just learning; my hyperactivity just makes me a “Chatty Cathy”; and I played a LOT of sports. Secondary school had so much structure - wake up, school, sports, homework, bed, repeat. 

I started falling behind in college, but I still didn’t get diagnosed for another 2 years. Why? Because I’m good at “playing the game”. I did exactly what this guy talks about - using hyperfocus to your advantage, as well as some other coping strategies.

But I still choose to be medicated. Why? Bc ADHD is more than just about being successful. There’s emotional regulation, maintaining relationships, and taking care of yourself. 

You can drown yourself in work, be extremely successful, and still be unable to “function”. The dishes are stacked up, you are unsure if the clothes you are wearing are clean, you forgot an important birthday, you have a RSD episode in front of all your friends... these things are serious and real. Like the video said, we don’t *want* to do these things. Obviously if we forget a birthday, it’s not our fault. And our friends know that. But they’re human too, and their feelings are valid if we forget a birthday. Honestly, even though it’s not my fault, I get sad I forgot my friends birthday. I wanted to spend the day and celebrate with them bc I want to show them how much I appreciate them. And that’s valid too. Bc all that stuff I mentioned lead to increased anxiety, depression, and some other mental health issues.

**TL;DR: Take this video with a grain of salt. You should love yourself, no matter what. With that in mind, it’s valid to have a love-hate relationship with your ADHD and need/want medication to treat it.**"

At least in New England, the holiday season is predominately Christian-based but has been capitalized to being practically secular at this point. Respect everyone’s boundaries (as always) but definitely try to set up fun activities. I think gingerbread houses are the most fun!

AskScienceDiscussion,fput9hm,t1_fpt03yt,1588922938.0,"So, there’s kind of a lot going on. Unfortunately, it’s very complex. But I’ll do an ELI5.

Think your personality. You were raised by your parents as a kid, so you have some natural tendencies. For example, my mom was a huge talker. I now talk a lot. However, that doesn’t mean I can’t be quiet. If I needed to be quiet because I’m in class or something, I can obviously be quiet. But my natural tendency is to talk a lot - so if I’m left to my own devices, like outside of class, I will probably be a chatter box.

So, to inherently change the natural tendency of our circadian rhythms, assuming they are all generally 24 hours, an evolutionary shift would be necessary. However, our ability to adapt could probably get us through. I mean, it’s 3 am, and I just finished my work for the day. I have gone to bed at sunrise. I know many people who do the same. How exactly this impacts mental health isn’t entirely clear. But the general vibe with evolution is, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” So, my sleep schedule is garbage, but it does not inhibit my ability to produce offspring, so my genetics will be passed on. Whether my garbage sleep schedule is a consequence of my genetics, my lifestyle, or both is unclear. But my offspring will only inherit my genetics, not my lifestyle choices. 

The only way my lifestyle choices could create problems for my offspring is by causing some sort of mistake during the process of making my offspring; for example, if I caused birth defect by drinking alcohol during pregnancy. So, if my garbage sleep schedule creates some sort of birth defect, then my lifestyles choices did affect my offspring. But the chances of that defect altering the genes that code for the circadian rhythm specifically is extremely, extremely low.

There are also epigentics which is like some hot topic in biology rn, which is like a genetic marker that is affected by the environment can be inherited. There was a study to show that mice who developed a fear to a certain smell through negative reinforcement produced offspring that had the fear of the smell without going through the experience themselves. But proceed with caution; there is no official consensus to show that lifestyle choices/learned behavior is inherited, and there needs to be much more research done. Furthermore, epigenetics are not really importantly to the story of evolution."

Also, if you were truly old fashioned, you would keep in mind that during WWII we had to go on rations to keep a war effort going on, but that was patriotic; not fascist. We live in a different time now where “E plurubus unum” (sorry for spelling) does not hold the weight that it once did"

REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fp78wue,t3_gboiun,1588366175.0,"There are non-stimulants for ADHD! But I actually agree - ADHD is going to inhibit the patient’s recovery. ADHD is full of emotional irregularities and executive dysfunction. It is not, by any means, far-fetched that the patient will have a hard time recovering.

Also, it is highly possible that the patient was trying to self-medicate with meth. Unfortunately, meth and other stimulants are no longer an option for the patient. Like many others, I would highly recommend a therapist that specializes in ADHD."

adhd_anxiety,fp46wbc,t3_gaxh9h,1588292884.0,"Try lowering your dose? Even if it’s by like 5 mg, it might be enough to lessen the anxiety. You may also consider a non-stimulant to help, but I haven’t heard good things about those. 

I believe that your medicine only comes in capsules. If so, I would recommend switching to a more “flexible” medication if possible. Get instant releases instead of ER so that way you can control when you take your meds better. Like, if you take a pill, you’ll be on it for like 3-4 hours instead of 5-6. Also, get small doses. That way you can take more if you have work, or less if you have social situations. Get tablets so you can break them in half or something if you need."

ADHD,fp3oc9j,t1_fp3lsnr,1588282866.0,"Yep! Um idk what kind of ADHD you have but it sounds like you are currently experiencing inattention. When I got that I would just try to caffeinate if I didn’t have medication. Make sure you hydrate too!!!! Bc dehydration makes it so much worse!!!!

But like just exercise if possible? Idk the hyperactivity is always much easier to work with. But like. Rest if you need. But this is a good time to definitely do that “one second” stuff if you really can’t find the means to concentrate. But don’t fight the inattention too much bc it sucks. Just work with what you got! 

If you’re stuck in perpetual inattention then maybe try to get yourself to hyperfocus if the caffeine doesn’t work. Even if it’s not productive, it might be enough to make you “snap out of it”. 

Let me know if this was helpful!!"
TwoXChromosomes,fp3ckt3,t1_fp33l2q,1588276957.0,"I can see what you are saying, and I do think there is a huge issue with people invalidating the sexism that men experience. I would like to clarify that most of what I said in here is not what I actually said. When my friend say they were sexually harassed too, what I actually said was, ""That's horrible, and I'm sorry. You should have never had to go through that.""

Also, when my friend said he got unmatched on Tinder, I said, ""I know. I see it all the time with girls which is why I have a tough time being friends with people like xxxx."" (xxxx being one of my shallow roommates.) I have also said to him personally, ""Guys get held to unrealistic standards and that's totally stupid. They are expected to do all these things while girls play the damsel in distress. You are not less of a guy because of your height. Anyone who thinks that doesn't deserve you."" During this all, it's important to remember that being inclusive is important. If I want people to validate me, I should also validate others.

What I wrote are the thoughts I am thinking after I feel like I have had to explain how sexism has severely, negatively impacted me for the millionth time. I just get frustrated because when I say that sexism still affects women, I feel that it gets interpreted (not just by men) as ""I don't think sexism happens to men."" That could not be further from the truth. I just think that in response to this interpretation, people forget that some issues are predominately women's issues, or at the very least affect women and men differently. 

I'll just clarify with an example. Men get told to suppress their emotions. That is an issue predominately experienced by men. Women's emotions may get brushed off, but the actual act of expressing them is widely accepted and even endearing. I, as a women, have been told to suppress my emotions. But the reason is different. I was told to suppress my emotions because they were annoying to those dealing with me; when men get told to suppress their emotions (""Man up!) it is because there is a societal expectation that men do not express emotion because it is emasculating. So if a guy was telling me about his experience of being told to ""Be a man"" and I followed up with, ""Well I was told to stop crying and 'man up' too"", I'm erasing the larger factor at play: a culture of sexism playing into several individual experiences uniquely experienced by men.

I hope this clarifies what I'm trying to say. I still definitely have a lot of learning to do, but I want to make clear that what I wrote here was purely a rant in my head that I had at like 3 am lmao.

TL;DR What I wrote isn't actually what I said. It was a rant in response to what I feel as misinterpretation."
ADHD,fp3614y,t1_fp2tkg3,1588273703.0,"Yeah! Anytime! If I think of anything else, I will let you know :)"
ADHD,fp2shyv,t1_fp2n5k9,1588267153.0,"Damn that sucks big time. I’m sure you feel like garbage without your meds, cause I always do. But, do you take regular breaks from your meds? I know nothing about tolerance in relation to adderall, but it’s probably a good idea to integrate more breaks from your meds if you’re on 50 mg per day. 

When I was unmedicated I would basically treat myself like a 5 year old. Worked like 60% of the time. If you do 15 min of this, you do this. If you get up, you reward yourself with this. Be gentle and compassionate. A 5 year old is not expected to understand or have a good attention span, and your brain is chemically designed to not concentrate! And a 5 year old is going to listen to you if you’re nice - not if you’re mean. So be nice to yourself.

Also, make your goals *achieveable*. Like, if you have a 20 math problems to do, don’t say “after 15 min I will have all of them done!” Bc you know what happens? You won’t get it done. And then you will be mad at yourself. And then you will have rejection sensitivity or some sort of other dysfunction. and then you will crie. I used to say after one problem I will browse amazon for 5 min. Seems ridiculous, but the semester I did that I had a 3.5 GPA unmedicated.

I would also say find what motivates me. For me, what helps is working with other people. Which, hard to do now! But even if you can sit on FaceTime with someone. It’s especially helpful to work with your colleagues so you guys can have a concrete goal that you can encourage each other on. 

All in all, **try to activate the reward center of your brain as much as possible when doing your goals**. 

As for breaking down your day, try to think when you tend to be most motivated/productive. For me, it’s mid afternoon to sometime in the evening when I am medicated. Unmedicated, it’s mid morning to mid afternoon. Then I experience a horrible afternoon crash. Then I am able to do a little more work, maybe, in the evening. And what I had to focus on was not how little I time I had, but how to use the time I had as best as possible. Use breaks wisely as well. If you do a chunk of work, go exercise! Or take a shower! Or eat! Boom. Self-care and a mental break. 

The other thing is that I would also do lazy work when I was tired. Have to format a file? Do it while you’re brain dead. Just do it. Bc getting it done now will be better than putting it off. Since we have ADHD we find ourselves submitting at the last second. Literally. So you know what? When you get that one second thing done now, you are gonna be less stressed at crunch time. Ever miss a deadline by a second? I have. Any little bit you can get done, no matter how small, is an *accomplishment*. 

During this hard time, you have to *talk yourself up, not bring yourself down*. 

I discovered this when I was running cross country. When I was positively talking to myself during a race, I performed very well, taking 30 seconds or so off my typical 5k. When I talked myself down, I would slow myself down dramatically. 

Also, sleep!!

TL;DR Try to activate the reward center of your brain as much as possible when doing your goals. You do this by talking yourself up, making achievable goals, sleep, and rewarding yourself like you’re a 5 year old.

Hope this helps :) lmk if you have any more questions"

RBNLegalAdvice,fp2cn0y,t3_gawl98,1588259422.0,"Honestly, I can’t really help you out too much. But I would say at the very least, if you can afford it, contact a lawyer. They should be able to give you guiding advice. 

I also think grandparents don’t have any rights. Like you said, unless you are deemed unfit, you and the other parent have full parental rights. The grandparents have none.

This I can confidently say - when enrolling you child in childcare, there is ALWAYS a section for a “do NOT let this person pick my child up”. My aunt and uncle did that for my dad who was a heroin addict. Add them to the list - and at the very least you will never run into trouble that way, no matter how convincing the grandparents are when the show up to the childcare center. I worked for a childcare center, and if someone other than the parents show up you have to provide official identification in order to pick up the children and have to be approved by the parents before hand. But putting them on the explicit “NOT allowed” list is some extra protection!"
