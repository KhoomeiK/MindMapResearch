With his back against the wall he has taken some of the most left-wing, anti-business, pro-big government, pro-social welfare positions in the nation.

The point being, cosmetic surgery doesn't make up the majority of elective surgery and people are starting to be seen again for other procedures. To my point of hospitals not wanting empty beds and needing revenue. 

Could you turn that flow off again? Of course, but you are also risking those people's lives and that would only happen if the system is once again near capacity, in which case we would be nowhere near 30% vacancy.
