My friend gave me a book about murders in Thunderbay becuase they spilled coffee on it. I also enjoy learning languages. I feel as if it keeps my mind sharp, and I think that would be useful since I'm going to highschool the year after this year. Like any kid though, I have a very hard time socialising. I can talk to some people fine (with no anxiety), it's just the fact that I don't know how to talk to people without being offensive, I bring up touchy subjects, I have a hard time reading social cues, and sometimes I don't know what people mean when they say things, I don't understand why the things I say make people uncomfortable, and stuff like that. no one seems to care though. it's just how schools on the res work."
