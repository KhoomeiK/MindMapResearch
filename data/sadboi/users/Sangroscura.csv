opiates,fnoer1z,t3_g2tfzh,1587122677.0,"It's impossible to know. It's certainly possible that taking just one will put you on a path towards addiction. It has happened to others in similar fashion. 

One thing is certain. If you don't take it, there is a 0% chance of becoming addicted."
opiates,fno37e9,t1_fno2dk3,1587110399.0,">  Maybe Iâ€™ll od?

Don't try that route here. It won't work and just piss people off and they'll peg you as a manipulator. 

Every local rehab place also addresses underlying issues. I don't know of anyone else that thinks they are garbage. How come you think this? It's just a matter of getting you detoxed and away from temptation until it's been long enough to give you a fair fight. It's just time. No place has a magical cure. 

Lastly - there are many out of the box options that aren't nearly that much. I'm guessing you're  in the Southwest. When I lived in CA I drove down to Mexico and paid $500 for ibogaine treatment. That's pretty out of the box and not stupid expensive. 

Good luck to you. How long have you been out for? Where did you do your time? Four years in solitary is insane. Every state I'm aware of have laws that restrict maximum solitary confinement to a matter of 2-3 weeks."
opiates,fno2kkl,t3_g2w81o,1587109748.0,"I used for years not knowing what  cotton fever was. I used to keep all my gear, spoons and used cottons in a glasses case. Often times the charred bottom of the spoon would come into contact with the cottons. I would keep the cottons in there for weeks and when I didn't have dope I would also keep rinsing and shooting the cottons. I went forever without getting cotton fever.

About 6 months ago I was desparate and shot a cotton I found on the floor. Who knows how old it was. I can tell you that it was absolutely dreadful. Lesson learned. Like always, wait until the pain is a distant enough memory before doing it again. Two months  later I find myself in a similar desparate position and I find cottons on the floor. This time I told myself that I will cook the shit  out of it - a good raging boil for a few seconds and I should be okay. Well - I did that a couple of times and I was okay.

So do with that  what  you will. I don't know if cooking it was the factor or dumb chance. From my experience it's also really rare, however I hear  from others they have gotten it a few times."
opiates,fno1ygt,t3_g2wciv,1587109128.0,"First - everyone here is going to tell you to go fuck yourself as with anyone coming in here  with a story and a paypal account. Besides, how many opiate addicts do you figure are in a position to provide financial assistance to anyone ?

I'm going to assume that you're being sincere and you really do want to go to rehab. If you call around there are plenty of  detox and rehabs that the state will pay for. They will even help you apply for medicaid or whatever necessary forms.

If you want to get clean, you don't need a fancy $25,000 detox or rehab. A local clinic will get you through the worst part - and that's all you can ask for, of any place you go. After that your chances of relapse are the same and down to you."

opiates,fnh7tlx,t1_fngsqdw,1586956923.0,Syrup? Everyone is saying there would be no rush. You would shoot and just  fall out ?
opiates,fnh7pt6,t1_fngheca,1586956854.0,"Thanks. I've seen the effects on people's veins, I was just wondering what the upside was. Apparently it's just desperation."

opiates,fn92bnd,t1_fn8vc5q,1586757093.0,"Haha. We've all had the kiblles n' shits. Personally, I found that I would get the rabbit shit balls when my use was relatively lower. If I would use  a lot and not let more than a few hours pass they would all be compacted together into this monstrous voltron shit that most toilets aren't equipped to handle."
opiates,fn8uv2m,t1_fn8unun,1586750850.0,Ok. I never heard of that before. Everyone i've ever spoken to gets the shits within the first day. Lucky you. Maybe it's because you don't eat much or something else.
opiates,fn8rfby,t3_g0a01t,1586748310.0,Was it nothing before the 2 weeks of dillies? If you had no experience before then maybe not. The real test is diarrhea. If you don't have that then it's not withdrawals and you've got the Rona.
opiates,fn83o11,t3_g06960,1586733219.0,"There's heroin and then there is everything else. (Yes, with some powerful exceptions you fucking pedants) 

If you use  the heroin you'll be wasting  anything  else you take with it. Can't really brass knuckle heroin with another opiate, you'll just be pissing on a waterfall."
opiates,fn7w6pr,t1_fn7voix,1586728860.0,Daaaamn. Nice. How'd you get those kinds of ins? I had a raw connect but the dude would always be coked out of his mind and one day he pulled a gun out on me. Idiot lost a lot of business over some bullshit.
opiates,fn7vfwd,t1_fn7v16g,1586728437.0,"What kind of shit you getting? You get ""fent free"" ?"
opiates,fn7uoj7,t1_fn7u60d,1586728002.0,"Well, I'm trying to be respectful of the sub's rules. I can only say that there are trains - which could be many cities. But if you're sharp enough to figure it out, or think you did - I think we're still ok. 

Quality has been the same since quarantine. Same shit. Always  prefer actual dope. Fent just makes you sleepy and doesn't really  give you the kick at the beginning. Plus, withdrawals seem to be much tougher to manage. 

ECP has been garbage for a couple years now, ever since the fent took over. Hate that shit. Like I said, they all swear their shit has no fent - but the test comes when you use it. It feels very different."
opiates,fn7tqk1,t1_fn7teq2,1586727455.0,"I figured you thought that since you said L-stop. But where I am some  stops are  elevated, mostly not.

Everything is  fent. Everyone swears their shit doesn't have any fent, that they test it, blah blah blah - but it all does. I can tell by the  effects. I had a delivery guy for a while but he was a grimy piece of shit and  I had to cut him loose. He still owes me six bags actuallly. He knows where I live though."
opiates,fn7t2tb,t1_fn7svyk,1586727069.0,"You misunderstood. I was trying to be slick by using the word ""shudder"". I should have  said that  I Sutter."
opiates,fn7spsp,t1_fn7she6,1586726859.0,Oh shit. I shutter to think that someone might be able to guess it based on the info I've given.
opiates,fn7omja,t3_g03ii3,1586724507.0,"Souns like one of those weird terms you would find on Urban Dictionary. 

Heroin Egg Hunt:

When the cops are searching you after you scored some dope but the bags are safely nestled under your balls.

The police stopped me again yesterday using stop and frist. I wasn't worried  though. They were on a Heroin Egg Hunt."
opiates,fn7mrb1,t1_fn7jclb,1586723435.0,There are two clinics like 8 blocks apart - one  with the  liquid and other with the wafers. So A lot of the people from the  programs are  alll hanging out  in the same places trying  to sell theirs. I've made connets by this point so I know a few people willing to sell.
opiates,fn7fhei,t1_fn7cc2x,1586719292.0,I always try to have methadone on hand in case I'm in a dopeless bind. I would definitely make that stretch and wean through the amount.
opiates,fn7ay67,t1_fn7ak1l,1586716743.0,"I guy methadone as a safety net, and because I tell myself I will use it to get clean. It was about 300mg. 

When the cops started talking I was thinking of casually chugging it. Not to get rid of the  evidence as much as a means to try and stave of withdrawals."
opiates,fn79ksi,t1_fn78m91,1586715963.0,"All good. It's amazing when looking back at how I've behaved when high, how badly my judgement was affected. 

When people ask me how cognitive function is affected by heroin I've always understated it since you can still function. I've held numerous jobs with a heroin addiction. So while it doesn't impair the way something like alcohol would, it's very easy to lose awareness of just how high in the clouds your head is at."
opiates,fn77qdg,t3_g015j5,1586714925.0,"If 1mg of subs get you high then your tolerance is quite low. Take 10. You can always  take more, but you  can't take  less."
opiates,fn77icn,t1_fn75c8t,1586714798.0,"It sounds like you're telling me I shouldn't attract the police when I am in possession of heroin in a drug ridden neighborhood. 

NO FUCKING SHIT. I wasn't thinking clearly, I didn't think it was  a good idea. But I think you know  that. You're not trying to be helpful or instructive, you just seem to thirst for any opportunity to make yourself feel like you're better than someone.

I also never said I gave myself a half haircut. Don't know how you arrived at this. I shaved my head. Full haircut. I'm also not skinny, which makes me stick out all the more because people take me for a cop. Lastly, mentions of luck mean I was lucky to not have gotten searched and arrested. You're the  only one that thinks people talking about luck mean it relates to attracting the police."
opiates,fn75u50,t3_fzwhaz,1586713869.0,"Besides things like fiber, laxatives etc. I think the most important thing you can do is to allow some time in-between doses every now and again.

Typically the urge to shit is my timer for having to re-dose. Soon as I feel any movement in my bowels it's like a dope-dinner bell. Then when I do shit I clog the toilet  with a fucking python. Now when I feel any urge I will wait a bit longer and fix up on the toilet, shit and shoot."
opiates,fn74bc6,t3_fzpnp4,1586713025.0,"This is true for human interaction in general. What makes this situation unique is the balance of power. They know how dependent you are on them and some will use the leverage to mistreat you as much as you  allow it. 

From my experience it's best to never have only one connect. For multiple reasons, all relating to him thinking he has to earn your business instead of you being completely reliant on it.

This is true for all occasions of people that test you and act disrespectful, but my rule for this is to always address it right away. The sooner you address it the less force is required when you stand up to them. If you allow someone  to disrespect you for long enough, eventually nothing you do will change it."
opiates,fn736rn,t1_fn6xuo7,1586712403.0,"I wonder. I feel like I was able to keep it together while they questioned me but obviously I can't be a reliable judge of that. They were really focusing on whether I was suicidal. 

Blessings counted. : )"
opiates,fn72xnq,t1_fn6y3t3,1586712263.0,"The stop I was on is usually pretty empty even without the Rona. I'm usually very cautions in that area. I'm certainly not new to those neighborhoods and copping off the streets. Looking back I realized I was careless yesterday in other ways too. I don't blend in no matter what I do as is. I'm comically out of place in such areas.

It's funny because I always think that being high on dope doesn't affect my judgement but yesterday it certainly did. It was certainly a wake up call and a very cheap lesson."
opiates,fn7273o,t1_fn6wj01,1586711854.0,"I thought for sure they were going to search me. The aside from is everything. Cops where I am come up with bullshit reasons to search someone, they certainly don't need to be given one.

I was being careless and cocky. People don't sit on the ledge of the  platform like that. It was very bad judgement and I was extremely lucky."
opiates,fn71u12,t1_fn6xt1j,1586711652.0,"I can't think of any question you asked that isn't answered by what I wrote. 

I'm telling everyone I did something stupid on r/opiates and you decide to take the opportunity to try and lecture me? Still can not manage to...blah blah. What are you getting at by asking meaningless questions? I guess there's always at least one of you though."

No one is poring over your comment history. It's just a quick look for confirmation - yup, this guy is just thirsting for the opportunity to feel superior to someone and put  other people down. Hope the sad shit gets better. No one deserves to be that miserable."
opiates,fkfizd0,t3_fhxqcp,1584135450.0,You put some people  in charge of inspecting your asshole and in time they're smelling it and asking you what you had for breakfast to see if it matches up. As long as they get to wear some kind of blue colored uniform they'll be quite pleased with themselves for it.
opiates,fkfi6pa,t3_fhzr88,1584134941.0,In all likelihood someone else had them in his asshole before that too. So at least he's washing the feces off them for you. Dude sounds like such a slut.

opiates,f5oy29z,t1_f5krxgb,1572338812.0,"Hey. Thanks. The swelling is gone. 

You're right. IV is a bad scene. Not only all what you mentioned, but you become addicted to the needle in some twisted way. If I have dope I have absolutely no desire to sniff it. And it's not even the high that makes me relapse, it's the imagery of the needle filling up with blood. Tanks G."
opiates,f5kdi4w,t1_f5kbuvs,1572260726.0,"I've mined in that vein for a year now though. It's been real good to me. I guess the blood was bright, but I wouldn't have thought it was different than any other time. Vein is real hard and though it registered I felt pain after like 70% and I knew I lost it. 

Tanks."
opiates,f1lriv4,t1_f1ldft4,1569565333.0,"The problem is he  sold him fake oxys that were pressed with fent. He was dosing for what he thought he was getting, but the fent didn't allow him to calculate how much he was intaking. 

So if  he had sold him whatever straight up then it'd be  one thing. The issue is selling him fake pills pressed with fent. That's a way to make more profit in return for playing  with people's lives. Fuck that guy."

opiates,ets7rad,t1_ets6vr4,1563138612.0,Certainly. I'm wondering if it's exacerbated  or caused by the funky dope cut.

I may take you up on that. I've never had anyone to talk to about this, it's always been a double life."
OpiatesRecovery,eqeajkm,t1_eqdz4i8,1560001433.0,Thank you. I'm just the only thing in her life that isn't a huge disappointment as of the last few years. I would do anything to keep her from finding out - I don't know what it would do to her. I fear it would crush her soul and cause her to lose hope. She says that I'm her hope. She says I'm her light. I don't want to extinguish it for anything.
OpiatesRecovery,eqe9yoj,t1_eqdyalv,1560001223.0,"You're right. I have scored years worth of subs from the streets. It was so difficult to get off that I have been wary of getting back on. I know how ridiculous that is since here I am shooting dope like an idiot. Just a year ago I had a couple weeks of clean time. Now I can't even go a day with methadone or subs.

Maybe I can be on subs for a month and taper off. I just don't want that to be my life again, but I also can't keep living like this. Thank you."
OpiatesRecovery,eqe8l6i,t1_eqdu57h,1560000733.0,"Yes, ease of jumping on and off. I was also on subs for years and getting off that was so difficult that I really have a hard time with the idea of going back on maintenance. 

I haven't jibed well with the 12 step in the past. I looked into SMART recovery, and went to one of those meetings. It was okay, but two of the people were there for addictions to chocolate and texting - also the 2 people that spoke the most. I like the idea of having someone to call when I'm feeling weak though."

My best advice - try to look as ragged and unattractive as possible. Shit, know what, tell them you have AIDS. Actually, that might not even deter them. Maybe try to always wear a hoodie and cover your face with your hair if it's long like the girl from the ring and act real mental or something. Carry a bag of shit in your pocket."
