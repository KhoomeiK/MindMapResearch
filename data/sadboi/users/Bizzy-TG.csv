Edit.  Responding to the newer comments below me

Until I make a few new fake accounts and build them up so I can avoid the racism here, I'll edit this one to say my piece.


Maybe the humor was lost on you, but that's what the upvote and down button are for.

All my other posts have been understanding, helpful or at least honest and showed I'm not just some guy who's married to a somali woman. I actually do love the culture and its people and have a deep understanding of it. 

So what if I don't think the buildings that guy showed were the best in the world? I said i think the people are the brightest before and you're gonna ban me because I'm not somali and you don't like my oppinion on buildings that clearly have seen better days, which would leave me correct in saying they are currently not the best in the world?

There's more beauty in somalia than the buildings that have been through constant war, so there's no need to reach like that.
Same thing with this emissions post. It's reaching.

If Canada had gone through what somalia has and still is and i posted pictures saying these dusty buildings, this light house and this beach are the best looking in the world, people would probably disagree with me too.

But because I'm not somali it's ok to be racist and stifle my oppinion by banning me and disrespect me by saying my wife is my girlfriend instead of having a dialogue on why you think I'm wrong, right? Pride is telling me otherwise, racist is calling me out by race and making it all about that. 

I really do wish the best for yall world wide. But if this is how you treat people who got love for you just because they don't always agree. Good luck ever escaping the chaos that plagues you with that kind of outdated mentality towards others. 

Guy below asked if I'm reer xamir like they're not somali. 
You guys segregate your own people, and when you can't anymore you define people by their hair, by their limp, or by their defect. 

Other guy said I thought you were my people. And you are. We're all Muslim.


Anyway. I don't want to waste anymore Energy on this topic because it's clear that while the world opens its arms to you with patience, understanding and kindness , you don't do the same to others and instead want to sit in virtual coffee shops and debate amongst yourselves like some old abti's. 

But like I said, since I'm studying somalia because I find beauty in it (but not the buildings, lol)  I'll be back under a few different names, old accounts and new. Depending on what works and what doesn't. 

Even if I'm right, your underlying hate won't allow you to agree, so it is what it is.

Mahmud has had far more heated debates with people here. But because they're somali their ignorance is tolerated. Some of those convos were wild, so I'll Admit I'm dissapointed in him chosing to ban me based on race.  I came here and stated who I am off rip because I felt comfortable being open and honest with you guys and look how you've treated me in return. 

Good job."

If you don't follow your heart, you could End up a bad husband to some girl who might be God's gift to the earth, and 2 years into the marriage you get bored or find yourself with wandering eyes for what you knew you wanted in the first place.


You asked how do you convince your dad. You don't.

You become your own man and do whatever the fuck you want, and just be polite and respectful about it.

But if it doesn't work for ANY reason at all, be prepared for all the negative minds to act like they were right even if they weren't. 


I was born Christian, converted to Islam and married a somali woman. My mom wasn't happy or understanding at first and my relatives don't understand me or islam and ask stupid questions to be rude/funny when at family gatherings, but I'm happy with me and where I am in life and just chill more with my somali family than my own blood. 

When I first got married and I told this one aunty, she was like ""be careful! Do you know people are being recruited into these terrorist groups and stuff these days?""That was so ignorant and fucked up I didn't go see her for years after that. 

But that's just the way it was gonna be. A lonely road. 

It wasn't pretty or easy but I knew what I felt and just followed that with no remorse or regrets. I just kept it real with myself and respectful to others. 

My mom now has a gradson she spoils, her and my wife are great friends and she has two somali stepdaughters who visit her on their own since we live in the same apartment building. 

Everything. Will. Be. Fine.

Much love to everyone here and to you, and inshAllah everything will work out for all of us.

It got better when I got the proper meds for it and had been on them for a while. Eventually I got married and got a job and never needed to take them again. 

But even now, I can still feel it creeping under my skin waiting for me to overreact to some sensation or feeling so it can resurface. It's a very distinct feeling.

I've been off those meds for 5 years and haven't had one panic attack in more than that.

But I'm not back to normal or cured. I wouldn't use those words at all. I'm just dealing with it like it's mind vs body when it even tries to get my attention.

And our ""brethren"" are dying in more places than just in somalia so why even bring that up like the death only matters if it happened in mogadishu? 

Go ask your mom or dad or someone else's why they left somalia when their brethren and family members were still dying during the war so they could bring their children overseas and let me know the answer since the thought sounds like treason to you. 

And when they tell you it's so you could do all the things I already said you should do previously, and possibly go back later, ask them"" if they know how fucking stupid that sounds.""

You and whoever brought you to the Netherlands have already physically left somalia behind and went to  one of the least somali places on the planet

You guys got waaaaay the fuck outta there.

Saying I'm not somali is straight up ignorance when these days somali heritage and culture is being lost in the youth who prefer western culture to their own. It's very possible for a non Somalis opinion to be more Valuable than an actual somali person depending on the level of enthusiasm for the topic and how much the non somali has learned. 



Also.
I send money back home to take care of people and have a place to live if I go there. 
I provide for my family of 5 Somalis under my roof, including my  hooyo (wife's side) who I also take care of the most which makes 6 of us. I've already got my somali pass. 

You being in the Netherlands sounds nice and comphy.
peaceful even.

Toronto ain't like that. 

And if you don't know, I'll provide you with some insight into why I said what I said originally and why you're coming across as narrow sighted. 


My original Opinion seems wrong to you  because while you make day dreamer posts about what ifs, and will it evers, the hooyos on my street are forming groups to work with the police so they can save their sons from gun violence. 

https://youtu.be/8N9eSv49PgA

Even the somali people here aren't  worried about if somalia can have a future. Nobody even asks that over here because everyone is occupied with real life issues so they take care of their family back home and keep it moving. 

Parents want their kids to LIVE long enough to have a life of their own and the kids are trying to navigate the streets safely and make it out alive. 

Some Shits just different bro.
I can only speak about  what I know and keep it 100 with you. 

Why gather in a circle while we sit comfortably on the toilet using our phones and ask if somalia will Have a bright future when you know its in a bad place right now? What does this even accomplish? Why not think about what we can do to give it that bright future sooner than later and post that instead of daydreaming and looking at the clouds hoping better times come by someone else's hand and ideas. 
We're literally just talking to talk. 

Ironically. if more people like me(Mr non somali) open their hearts to somalia and find beauty in it like I have, with unity maybe the burden of a better somalia wouldn't be so heavy.

Watch the video I linked so you can at least get an idea of what's happening around the world. Even if we don't agree you can at least leave with more knowledge than you came with and maybe make a few duas for your people in Toronto.

As long as they leave and be bright somewhere else, First? Or maybe just never go back home at all. 

Which is kind of the problem isn't it? Somali people  go else where, get educated and hope to make their home a better place. And when they finally do go back , they get killed.

That whole timeline might have taken 25-30 years alone. Full Of dreams and ambition only to have it end by the hands of your own people who don't want things to change at all. 


The entire plot is ironic and kind or sad. 

The hooyos who fled during the war came to America, Europe and canada/Toronto specifically. 
Only to have the kids they were trying to save grow up to be killed by gang violence at a rate so fast, that any shooting or murder here you can just assume its a somali and you'd be right most of the time. 

My stepdaughter is 17. She's been to about 6 funerals in Toronto in the last 2 years.
 
Like, your hooyo didn't leave somalia during the war, stay in Kenyan refugee camps to get out of Africa just to have you grow up here and get killed by gun violence. Know what i mean?  

Its out of control here. And then I see what's going on in somalia to people Who try to help out the proper, somali non western way even, and it's sad to see such bright, and often polite people get killed more so than any other people. 

I think the problems aren't just going to fix themselves with time and lead to a bright future. I think a lot of what's troubling somali people back home and abroad needs to be fixed with force, but it seems your government doesn't really want to disturb the peace between the government, clans and al shabab, depending on if you belive they exist. And the police force in Toronto won't crack down on the somali community the way they did on the Jamaicans back when they were running the show when I was growing up in Toronto.

apexuniversity,etkzd5r,t3_cc6x9o,1562914324.0,"Caustic wants you to run into his hidden traps and die. Wattsons traps are very visible and cause people to choose another route if they can't easily shoot the bottoms out.

Caustic does his thing in a  defensive yet aggressive manner. Wattson is all defense  and people will likely never run into your traps and you will do no direct damage with them. Her kit is all about area denial.

You see her traps from a mile away unlike casutic traps that can be hidden behind objects and around corners. 

Dont expect  to always really feel the impact her traps make the same way you do with caustics.

I guess I'd say caustic cans are traps. Wattsons fence is not a trap, it's a deterrent.

Her fence might aswell be made out of wood.

Anyway, always carry ultimate accelerators,  drop her ult before a team fight to stop nades, and her ult can eat her own teams missile barrage ults within the range. 

I threw out a Gibby ult and my teammate panicked because I didn't call it out in solos and wasted my ult by using his wattson ult. 


There's a fine line between caustic mains, lifeline mains and wattson mains.

I personally went back to caustic after getting killed with my goofy hand out trying to place a fence that just wouldnt drop one too many times lol."

Maybe even a lifeline almost dead or ill call it a 1shot if i know its literally like 25hp.

Calling out one shot when it's not could make a teammate over commit to something they might not be prepared for"

Overwatch,erj7sfn,t3_c25hfl,1560918445.0,"Good Moiras can get gold healing and gold or silver damage easy in quick play and carry the game. 

Bounce yellow balls in fights and use purple hand to attack priority targets and yellow hand when you need to. It's a good balance of offense and healing. 

If things are under control or you need to delete someone, purple balls and purple Hand and spam yellow hand when someone is about to die. This takes more skills and is a little risky for keeping people Alive. 

Moira and zen are made to DPs and heal at the same time. But it takes resource management and situational awareness not usually found in quick play.

And like someone else said, I wouldnt rely  on my team to deal with a slippery target when I have aimbot hands and some of the best aoe damage.

In fact, if the entire enemy team is huddled together on attack pushing a payload, Moira is certainly capable of doing the most damage outside of ults and making your team win. 


Quick play is always full of people who either can't bring enough damage, don't want to heal or don't want to Tank, so picking characters that can do two out or the 3 things and  hold their own like soldier or Moira or orisa is usually the best idea if you know you're probably capable of carrying but also need to fill another role to secure a win. 


I'm ranting for no reason.. 
The Moira in the video sucks."
