Talk to yourself in a mirror, sounds weird but have question cards, tapes to listen to and repeat whatever. Talk to yourself reading a book, a kids book! But the key is to look into your eyes, engage the mirror like a conversation. Change your voice even. I learned this trick when I went to massage school and how to deal with family or people you know getting a massage from you. Dont be too casual and dont be to clinical. Be natural. Does that make sense? Discreetly, video/phone tape yourself talking a few sentences and watch yourself! Be nice to yourself but try to see your triggers or tells that make you freeze. Talk to family and friends in both languages if you can. My favorite is changing the subtitles on my tv to spanish or changing the language to spanish with english subs on a show I know so I can hear it and correlate it to English."

I (5'1"" 34f) was looking for a bed frame for myself because I needed something bigger to fit my new boyfriend (6'5"" m29) we went through a couple stores, but couldn't see in person what I liked. Small town not a lot on the floors. Had slightly irritating sales people because I thought they knew I was just looking. At the Brick Canada I went in and this slimy suit walks up right from the door. So I start my need speech over again only to be interrupted as he asked my bf if that is what he needs. He isn't much of a talker more of a big friendly giant teddy. I'm down here waving hello!!! I'm getting the bed I need a queen not a cali king! He eventually shuts up when I say hello, I'm getting the bed down here dumbass! 
So he then asks ""for your son?"" And looks at my boyfriend 
""I said what no???"" Hello have you been listening?? After some awkward stares, the light bulb goes off I think he thinks he might have messed up... 

I stomp away never so insulted in my life. I hate being 5ft crap all with a personality much bigger. People look at you like a hissing kitten."
