GriefSupport,fiyenmo,t1_fiyd2ya,1582837942.0,I keep looking at my phone hoping his name pops up. He would text me every morning to tell me he loved me or give me words of encouragement. He was the funniest person I‚Äôve ever known. He had the best and most contagious laugh. He would send me memes when I was sad. He would buy me flowers and cherry coke for no reason. He started loving cats just because I did. He even saved money to help me fix up a room I could foster kittens in. He would do without so often just to surprise me or make me happy. Everyone always said they were shocked with how different he was with me. How much softer and more affectionate he was. It really made me feel special to be loved like that. On his 29th birthday last month I sang happy birthday to him and he would always joke about my bad singing but I could see how much he actually loved it in all of its awfulness. He always made me feel beautiful and important. God I miss him so much already. Sorry for the rant üíî

AmItheAsshole,fhv8j25,t1_fhtafr7,1581894439.0,"Agreed! ESH. 

OP - By your description, you seemed rather unphased until he popped back up and admitted to being married. You made it seem as though you were perfectly okay with single motherhood, but suddenly after finding out the father is married, you rush to get child support first, essentially screwing his other children and his wife. 

You CHOSE to have a one night stand knowing the potential consequences and you also CHOSE to have your babies while having accepted the fact that you weren‚Äôt going to have any help. The phrase ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exactly sound like something someone in dire need of financial assistance would say. 

He is DEFINITELY the biggest AH here, but no one in their right mind has a one night stand with someone they obviously barely know with expectations of anything more coming from it. You made a poor decision which led to a pregnancy that you decided to see through. Now five innocent children and their mother are financially trapped in a toxic household. How anyone could say that you‚Äôre completely void of any wrongdoing here eludes me."

GriefSupport,fa6oxkp,t1_fa08zj9,1575826957.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry for your losses and to hear you‚Äôre still struggling. It‚Äôs truly scary when I think of losing my mom and knowing it‚Äôs inevitable and coming soon and also knowing there‚Äôs nothing I can do to stop it. Losing my dad while knowing my mom is going to die was like a slap in the face. I have one surviving grandmother who doesn‚Äôt really like me all that much, she prefers my aunts kids over me and my siblings and it‚Äôs very obvious and always has been. I don‚Äôt want to feel like an orphan or feel even emptier than I do now. I feel like i‚Äôm desperately searching for connection with others, whether it‚Äôs friendship or something more, just so I don‚Äôt feel so alone and lost. I just want some stability in my life, I feel like I have no control. I really hope you can find a place that feels like home to you, and I hope we can both find our place in the world again."
GriefSupport,f9gr6ez,t1_f9gpe9s,1575303548.0,I hope I can too. Her birthday is on the 13th and I hope to spend that day with her as well and spoil her as much as I can. Thank you again ‚ô•Ô∏è
GriefSupport,f9gqpe2,t1_f9ggrjm,1575303356.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry you lost your best friend. You‚Äôre right, those last minutes you have with them can be very traumatic and hard to talk about. I found it was easier to say these things here, to complete strangers, than it is to tell most of my friends who are young and haven‚Äôt really experienced any major losses yet. As I told another kind user who commented, I only have one friend who has lost a parent and we aren‚Äôt able to see or talk to one another much. 

I‚Äôll definitely look into some type of grief counseling at some point because all of this combined is taking a lot out of me and I know my emotional and mental states are both very fragile right now. 

I am helping care for my mom. I‚Äôve had to have home healthcare teach me to drain her lungs of fluid (she had in 2 lung catheters) and while I knew I was helping to relieve her pain and help her breathe a little better if only temporarily, it‚Äôs still a scarring process and something I will never forget. 

Thank you for the reassurance, I guess I just didn‚Äôt want to seem like I‚Äôm the only one suffering when I know there are others in the same or at least similar situations. Thank you again for your kind words as they mean a lot ‚ô•Ô∏è"
GriefSupport,f9gnght,t1_f9fxat7,1575302003.0,"Thank you for your kind words and it certainly helps to know I‚Äôm not alone. I only have one friend who‚Äôs lost a parent and we aren‚Äôt able to get together much and talk so in a way I feel like I have no one who can relate which is why I searched for this thread in hopes I could find people struggling with the same feelings. 

It does hurt to know neither of them will see me get married or have kids and that my kids would never know who either of them were aside from photos and me sharing memories. I already feel very alone and I‚Äôm scared of how much worse that will be once my mom passes. But, I am doing as you said; I tell her I love her constantly and I spend as much time with her as humanly possible, soaking up every minute I can. Again, thank you for your response and I‚Äôm so sorry for your losses. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
