AskReddit,fq19sna,t3_ggdivs,1589043593.0,"If I'm being honest, this has been one of the best times I've had in the past 7 years. I've been able to take time to develop a healthier schedule and habits. I've been far less depressed and this has given me the mental break I've needed. I've been getting better sleep and I no longer have to worry about certain social obligations since I can't leave the house. I am a lot better about keeping the house clean and eating better. I'm honestly worried about when quarantine ends. I almost don't want it to, because I feel so good right now."

HelpMeFind,fj716u0,t3_fbxgl9,1583084340.0,"For the past few weeks, me and my boyfriend have been looking for prom dresses and stumbled across this design, which we absolutely loved. After many hours spent reverse image searching we found hundreds of store pages on websites such as dhgate, aliexpress, etc, using the same images. We eventually used facial recognition software to find the model, and traced the photos back to the original store [here](https://www.instagram.com/white_room1/) 

The company seems to be more local, but after chatting with the owners, who were in Russia,(we are Americans), we found that they were no longer carrying this dress. However, based on the nature and amount of the products they carried, we believe they must be manufactured somewhere else and by someone else.

We would just buy it from any of these other websites,(dhgate, aliexpress, etc), but they all seemed sketchy, since they all use the same photos. We would like to find a more reputable place to buy a dress similar to this, or at least confirmation that we could trust one of these sites. (We just really liked the design of the skirt and can't find anything like it)"
