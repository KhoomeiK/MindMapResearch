witcher,fr3roo6,t1_fr25n80,1589864429.0,Absolutely! It’s pretty much my gold standard for gaming now and I have trouble getting into a lot of other games. Couldn’t get past 10 hours of Final Fantasy 7 Remake because of its clunkiness so back to Witcher again!
movies,fqzaz73,t1_fqyo5e7,1589763580.0,Great observation! He was probably the only genuine person of the whole movie and got hacked to death for it. MORONS!!!
movies,fqyl8gj,t1_fqxjb1i,1589750407.0,Oh my god I thought I was the only one who loved  that line! Shame what happened to his character next.

LosAngeles,fq56c2t,t3_gg8cta,1589093946.0,"Oh the memories. Late night munchies or hangover comfort food, the 101 always hit the spot!"
unpopularopinion,fq4pubf,t3_ggj5k7,1589081399.0,Fuck this is spot on. As soon as you appear to have emotional instability of any kind you are marked as a leper and pushed to the fringe of your social circle.
AboveandBeyond,fq25fru,t1_fq1emiy,1589052996.0,"It was so much fun! Favorite moments were G&D, Spencer Brown, and of course the boys coming on at the end. Crowd energy was fantastic."
EDM,fpkb3q3,t3_gdv5hx,1588691428.0,Fred V and Grafix ftw!!! Gorgeous album
nin,fpi9inc,t3_gcsgnb,1588636365.0,Rockin this again right now! Never gets old. This was my first real NIN album and so glad I decided to get it.

LV426,fp0xxmc,t1_fp0ev06,1588219448.0,Definitely a solid contender. Loved his work in BSG.
LV426,fp0xw9i,t1_fp0m1or,1588219422.0,Ooo I can hear it already. Great choice!
LV426,fp0xvdu,t1_fp0uz7q,1588219405.0,Oh my god I’ve always wanted Denis to do an Alien project! BR2049 is my all time recent fav. GDT would be super interesting at least from a design standpoint...get him a good writer and we could have gold!
LV426,fozd5y2,t1_fozb7zr,1588188676.0,Have to rewatch Covenant again but yeah Goldenthal's Alien 3 is a treat. He really took the music to a spiritual level.
LV426,fozd0ct,t1_foz6ge9,1588188602.0,Solid choice! Chernobyl was downright haunting and she could inject that into the Alien universe.
LV426,fozcxxk,t1_foz6rvf,1588188569.0,This would be insane in the best of ways! Love his work on both Doom games!
decaf,fon76px,t1_fomykll,1587913721.0,Very interesting technique there. Definitely will try this week as my attitude and emotions towards work are the most challenging to deal with. Thank you for sharing!
movies,foiwybh,t3_g7oluh,1587799837.0,Bruh Zimmer killed the score! Movie was half assed for sure but the score by itself was a fantastic culmination of the Zimmer sound.
decaf,fo967z5,t1_fo6ktn7,1587611487.0,"Right now about two weeks. I’ve taken longer breaks before but my new job requires me to be at my desk almost the entire shift, something I’m not accustomed to."

AboveandBeyond,fmc1ke5,t3_ftzgd6,1585937177.0,Lovely breakdown however as a whole didn't go where I hoped.
electronicmusic,fmbw2p5,t3_fu6yxo,1585934281.0,Wow really enjoyed this one guys. Haunting and lush at the same time!
AngelsAndAirwaves,fmbdw6l,t3_ftwzxk,1585924362.0,Keep chasing the carrot guys...
alteredcarbon,fm9hdbo,t3_ftv06x,1585868768.0,You are in for a serious treat my friend. AC book is leagues better than the show. Broken Angels and Woken Furies are great in their own ways too. Enjoy!
politics,fm7zlrs,t1_fm7oa05,1585839955.0,Fantastic write up. I’ve been trying to keep the timeline saved in my head but this is perfect. Will be sharing!
trance,fm5z049,t3_fsp4m3,1585782846.0,Right there with you.
trance,fm5yf48,t3_ft3k36,1585782508.0,Never gets old. It's like the first time every time!
trance,fm0pvk5,t3_fscmv2,1585663754.0,Early Estiva is the best! Hope he revisits this sound.
nin,fllk58y,t3_fpgwy4,1585261923.0,Thank you god of the internet!
Coronavirus,flbivpm,t1_flbhti3,1585005552.0,There it is.
Costco,fl2e6wy,t1_fl2dgpx,1584748971.0,True. You would have to have at least two employees manning the entrance to screen/turn away members. Shit situation overall.
Costco,fl2d7l8,t1_fl10f59,1584748333.0,"Reduce operating hours and implement a shopping schedule based on member last names: A-C mondays, D-F tuesdays, etc. Cannot believe throngs of members continue to line up at 5am and for there to be 600 people waiting to get in at a time. It's Costco's responsibility to impose manageable conditions for their workers and reinforce actual social distancing since the general public is too paranoid and continues to panic buy."
Coronavirus,fkzu4cl,t1_fkztct8,1584680424.0,Completely agree with you. I wish they would stop dragging it out and just lock it all down. I wonder how effective Natl Guard would be in reality.
Coronavirus,fkzt8pe,t1_fkzskqu,1584679675.0,"I would have agreed with you a week or two ago but the numbers are jumping and people are still going out. Even at supermarkets in my area people aren’t keeping their distance as much as they should. 

The CA governor imposed statewide shutdown basically on the honor system. Do you think everyone is going to take it seriously?"
Coronavirus,fkz9a2f,t3_flk7ex,1584665684.0,Jesus christ those poor people. US news needs to be showing this on every channel now to get everyone in line. Hope they have a chance at making it...
Coronavirus,fkyhhhv,t1_fky27c5,1584648828.0,Yup they need this now. Watched a news report on supermarkets in Wuhan and the workers/managers all had masks and gloves.
LosAngeles,fkvmnwu,t1_fkvaw1w,1584572338.0,Watch “The Divide” to take your anxiety to ludicrous speed!
Coronavirus,fkutinm,t1_fkueda2,1584555850.0,Yup they will milk the fear messaging for a couple days and then have an expert come on to provide reassurance.
orangecounty,fkurqot,t1_fkua335,1584554914.0,"I was driving by to pick up my take out food from an adjacent restaurant by myself. I wouldn’t lock you up but come on, going out for ice cream with your kids seems fairly non-essential."
orangecounty,fku9pdf,t1_fku66th,1584545193.0,"Sure let’s just continue to let everyone roam around during a global pandemic. I saw two families at Baskin Robbins last night not social distancing at all, kids included."
SandersForPresident,fku55ln,t1_fku460j,1584542475.0,This right here. I love Bernie but he refuses to fully take off the gloves and defend himself against Joe’s attacks on M4A. I also wish he had gone full Trump and been more aggressive with his attacks. Joe was being an asshole and Bernie should have returned the favor.
AboveandBeyond,fkt3i8s,t3_fke4qp,1584505218.0,Goosebumps every time. What a golden moment!
electronicmusic,fkofmgw,t3_fjlv4t,1584386253.0,"Resistance is futile. Everyone needs to get in line do their part, including Prydz."
nin,fkofgv2,t3_fjnqll,1584386163.0,Yup. I got survivalism.
SandersForPresident,fknqj4m,t3_fjcrf7,1584371798.0,This was my favorite thing Bernie said all night. Such an important quality to have as an effective leader.
LosAngeles,fkkfnkf,t1_fkjnf9r,1584282868.0,So sad. I wish the news would have never covered the panic buying in the first place.
LosAngeles,fkjix33,t1_fkj5qku,1584247335.0,"Yup the line for Costco in Azusa stretched outside the main plaza and down the street at least half a mile. People were getting dropped off from the main street to get in line. This was at 8-9am, one hour before opening!"
Coronavirus,fkblory,t3_fhi4xj,1584035309.0,"Oh sure, let's get thousands of people together in crowded spaces, dehydrate their bodies and weaken their immune systems, and then send them on their merry way home to spread whatever they may have. Natural selection at it's finest."
LosAngeles,fk99psb,t1_fk8pb59,1583971610.0,Which ones had narrower hours? The one I went to was open for a solid week 8 hours a day plus weekends. I agree that LA county not being prepared for a huge influx of people on Super Tuesday was unacceptable but I also think voters should absolutely not have waited until the last day.
LosAngeles,fk96lwa,t1_fk95iuj,1583969775.0,Probably for the best. The layout of that location is nuts!
LosAngeles,fk95egh,t1_fk8x16a,1583969062.0,God help anyone going to Alhambra. That Costco is hell on earth.
SandersForPresident,fjpc88o,t1_fjom62l,1583547088.0,Unfucking real. All of these news networks should be held accountable for enabling and normalizing this type of behavior.
LosAngeles,fjije5t,t1_fjiccih,1583368943.0,Started doing this last night and felt like a complete fool. Wife laughed at me as well. But hey better safe than sorry!
SandersForPresident,fjhyb2x,t1_fjhify7,1583357298.0,Yup. Last night a college student in Sacramento was asked why Biden and he said “Because he’s my guy. Bernie is a career politician and we need someone with experience like Joe”. The reporter then told the student that Joe is also a career politician and asked him to specify any policies of Biden’s that persuaded him to vote. The student could not name a single policy and just said “He’s my guy”.
SandersForPresident,fjhxq7e,t1_fjhwb60,1583356991.0,Yes that would be my best guess. I didn’t see a precinct breakdown anywhere but share if you happen to find one.
SandersForPresident,fjhuyjm,t1_fjhqwzt,1583355535.0,"100% this. I was honestly impressed with a lot of Warren's policies but she should have dropped along with Pete and Amy. She had to know she had a minimal chance of either getting delegates or winning a contested convention. If this isn't part of the Dems effort to win, then she and her campaign are truly selfish."
SandersForPresident,fjfzjpd,t1_fjfz6rt,1583305317.0,This needs to be discussed more than just “winning” the state.
SandersForPresident,fjfiuui,t3_fd39yw,1583292686.0,Jesus christ Biden is using Bernie's talking points almost word for word about unions and bringing everyone together. Absolutely disgusted
television,fjdvb99,t3_fcuvl6,1583259956.0,"Thank god, he's one of the best side characters of the show!"
alteredcarbon,fj8xqxf,t1_fj8x8bd,1583125225.0,"Fair enough, glad you enjoyed it. Perhaps I’ll watch another ep or two."
alteredcarbon,fj8x4sa,t1_fj8wjhf,1583124706.0,How did you like it compared to S01?
alteredcarbon,fj8c61d,t1_fj1zte2,1583109960.0,"Really? With the right budget and creative minds it could have been incredible. So many cool settings and characters, not to mention the Martian element that goes insane towards the end. Why do you think it wouldn't work?"
alteredcarbon,fj8c2my,t1_fj1zube,1583109896.0,"Book 1 is pretty similar with a few important changes (Book Rei is not Tak's sister, she's a psychotic Yakuza named Reileen Kawahara). Book 2 takes place on one planet and focuses on a military conflict while Book 3 takes place on another and is more family/legacy drama. It's a shame the show tried to combine the two because they work perfectly as standalone stories."
alteredcarbon,fj8br2p,t1_fj2e3q0,1583109684.0,"I refuse to be dragged through a lackluster season when the writing is clearly on the wall. And honestly the book changes aren't what bothers me the most, it's the complete abandoning of what made the good parts of S01 good. I've been burned too many times with shows that barely stay above water for a whole season."
alteredcarbon,fj8bh17,t1_fj2iipq,1583109497.0,Lack of nuance encapsulates perfectly what S02 is. You're right about the first half S01! So many awesome moments and really cool world building.
alteredcarbon,fj8bchg,t1_fj2nili,1583109412.0,I wish I were saying the opposite because I have been looking forward to this since S01 ended and since I finished the books last year. Complete wasted potential.
alteredcarbon,fj8b8xb,t1_fj2qke7,1583109347.0,"I don't mind consolidating the material but they failed to produce quality results across the board in favor of generic, almost YA level scenes."
alteredcarbon,fj8b39p,t1_fj2rm1a,1583109240.0,Absolutely lukewarm opening scene. The flow was cringeworthy.
alteredcarbon,fj8azoy,t1_fj2s3a0,1583109174.0,First book is definitely the cream of the crop but I rather enjoyed book 2 quite a bit. What didn't you like about the 2nd book?
alteredcarbon,fj8awoc,t1_fj2teno,1583109115.0,Completely agree and I'm not even going to waste my time watching the other episodes. If they were this incompetent for the first episode then they don't deserve my time/attention for seven more eps.
alteredcarbon,fj8aqps,t1_fj2wlit,1583109004.0,B-Rated sci fi show is the perfect description. It was almost soap opera level bad in terms of trite dialogue and wooden performances.
alteredcarbon,fj8aofy,t1_fj30ql3,1583108960.0,Dang really...it's a shame because I generally like Mackie but the choice to cast him for S02 never sat right with me to begin with. Compound that choice with a lazy script and you get a lackluster season 2.
alteredcarbon,fj8aliz,t1_fj30zn8,1583108906.0,Watchmen was outrageously well done! Definitely going to be watching it again but can't say the same for AC sadly.
alteredcarbon,fj8aicp,t1_fj4b193,1583108847.0,"You're absolute right. Quell/Quellism in the book served as Kovac' ideological backbone as well as a phantom emotion he kept returning to. The continuation of the ""romance"" between Takeshi and Quell in S02 shows exactly where the showrunner's priorities were."
politics,fj5bymv,t1_fj5a6t6,1583029066.0,Yep. The least expensive higher education cost.
SandersForPresident,fj1odhp,t1_fj0m0eb,1582924269.0,Yup I voted last weekend. Vote center was a ghost town and I loved it. Easiest and most important vote of my life!
alteredcarbon,fj1jril,t1_fj1ioin,1582921533.0,"Yeah from an interview I read with the showrunner, it seems like the crux of the entire season was supposed to be about Kovacs trying to figure out his romance with Quell...like come on guys the source material was so much more than that!"
politics,fiz1o7n,t1_fiyxces,1582852034.0,Welcome to the good ol USA.
politics,fisiinw,t3_f9m1vp,1582685481.0,How do you help the people in Syria? Pete: “Do what we can but anyway back to my healthcare beef with Sanders from earlier!”
politics,fisfzvc,t1_fisfwuc,1582684134.0,He did say that and it was the hardest I’ve laughed during these debates.
politics,fisefru,t1_fise9wf,1582683272.0,Sides are killing me after that!
politics,fisd1z2,t3_f9le84,1582682509.0,Bloomberg claims he beat them last week to roaring applause. Fuck CBS for this blatant deception.
betterCallSaul,fiqxxwt,t1_fim4m1t,1582653612.0,Perfect way to illustrate Jimmy's feelings about being a McGill.
SandersForPresident,fi5jiiv,t3_f6kh8a,1582164491.0,JESUS CHRIST Bloomberg isn’t human.
SandersForPresident,fi3t0di,t1_fi2cspx,1582127023.0,"Wow, I never considered the power of Sander’s candidacy in this way. I completely agree with Boots and I think it illustrates why someone like Bloomberg or Steyer will not work for our country in the long run."
