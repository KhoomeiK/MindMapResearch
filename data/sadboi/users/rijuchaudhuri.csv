We are accused of that privilege thing and are left alone to deal with this feeling of self guilt for the rest of our lives. Maybe it's not just in my head either. Anyways, good luck to you too. We need a way out. We must overcome this. And I'm hopeful we will."
depression,fngskzt,t1_fngpimv,1586943396.0,"Wow. You guys really share a lot of the same experiences. I think I can explain it too. This feeling of 'guilt' I talked about, it makes my brain say that I shouldn't be making friends because it's like a trap which I'll get nothing from or it says that I'm just not worthy like others to be friends with them. I don't know if I'm making any sense, but I guess that's how my thinking process goes."

AskReddit,fhhcmbn,t3_ecscwk,1581600864.0,"Late comment here, but the website [last.fm](http://last.fm) tracks all the music you listen to completely for free from all the music streaming services and with its 'scrobble' feature, you can pretty much track any music from any website including YouTube. You can also get yearly listening data, much like Spotify Wrapped but with more detailed data.

It used to be popular back in the days. It has no reason to plummet down like this. Let's make Last.fm popular again!"
