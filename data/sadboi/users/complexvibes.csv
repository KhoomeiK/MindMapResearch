Your sun opposes mars you might be a more hot tempered Pisces and or critical mars is planet of war and it’s in the sign of Virgo. Ocd tendencies, rigidity, wanting you do everything never asking for help etc"

AskAstrologers,fn21fvm,t1_fn201wa,1586575339.0,Lol 😂 truly a great question and  ahhh Aquarius so you have a Pisces mars or Uranus? Is that why it’s your chart ruler or ..

Also definitely I am interested and good at many things also have a vast array of work experience in different fields.  but don’t really have any direction in finding a career path. I do hope to find that out soon as I get older. I have expensive taste so want a great paying job that keeps me stimulated and interested but also in a field that people respect each other.

AskAstrologers,flzsvbj,t1_flzqif7,1585632530.0,I’m sure it isn’t easy. I hope you do what’s best for you at the end of the day. Don’t sell yourself short some things aren’t alway worthy enough of a reason to stay. Love isn’t always enough. And just becusse you say no now doesn’t mean I’m the future you can’t still be friends or  maybe lovers but again you’re worth it. The basics should be reciprocated even in a friendship one person shouldn’t feel as if they’re keeping the friendship afloat etc balance is key
AskAstrologers,flzps96,t1_flzjtis,1585629919.0,You might have to ask yourself why you think it’s worth staying or why you’ve stayed so long too.

You have to decide if you’ll be ok with it or leave even if he does change 2 years from now you might have to ask yourself why you’re willing to hold back the present  for any promised future.

AskAstrologers,fk2efa2,t1_fk2e468,1583799209.0,The Sun right now is in Pisces and Neptune has been Pisces so it is transiting your planets in Pisces. So in your case Venus which is exalted in Pisces so a lot of Piscean energy going on in your fourth house roots and family .
AskAstrologers,fk2dxwg,t1_fk1tt28,1583798900.0,Okay I’m glad :) bc I feel that is half the challenge and do more Aries are super creative as well! Don’t believe the hype that Pisces are the only emphatic creative begins we all have that in us. Aries scorpio is a very common combo I love it and Scorpio is a fiery water :)  your sun is also in the 5h which is a creative house the house of  Leo and your sun sextiles Jupiter ( so great expansive creative thinking). Study your chart more forsure and the aspects also there is a heavy Neptune transit in Pisces that could make you feel more Piscean at the moment but yeah hope this helps! Goodluck on your astro journey

piscesastrology,fizzfhk,t1_fizw582,1582881737.0,"What reassures you? It’s hard to reassure someone who you feel can’t be vocal about their needs. I am intuitive but I can’t read someone’s mind and that is where I think the problem is. Yet he is comfortable opening up to people he dates and give them a much longer leash than I’m given. It’s almost as if I have to walk on eggshells, anything I say is too harsh yet they claim to value my opinion. It’s just hard becusse I care but I feel like I am carrying the relationship on my own"

Make their own mistakes and even if they ask me I don’t say anything becusse you can tell someone something doesn’t mean they will change then you’re stuck as the whole. But my intuition is usu on point, it’s annoying like stupid annoying. And when friends vent to me not giving advice and just listening I’ve learned that too. I want to “fix “ ppl but ugh idk it’s like I have so much knowledge but people don’t appreciate it until muchhhh later and tell me thanks for being there to tell me the hard truth but usually it’s like after they discard me for telling them that same truth. I never win"

Thank you for your response and you’re right it just sucks. I wish I could tell the ways I’ve defended their name and stuff since but that would seem so stupid I wish and hope that one day they believe how much I truly care and love them. They honestly family to me and sometimes I feel hesitant even sharing that with them because of how they’ve responded to me opening up about how much I care for them. Yet they can fall in love with morons who treat them badly after 2 weeks. I just don’t get it
piscesastrology,fiz2gfz,t1_fiz0a1f,1582852567.0,"Hi I did hurt them in the past unknowingly and we’ve moved past that at least I thought. We cleared the air after not speaking for some years. I’m big on communication, they finally told me why and since then I’ve made sure to not do those things. Also it didn’t help that he thought I knew when I didn’t... I’m a Pisces as well ( 3 placements ) so even though I hate confrontation,  for ppl I care for I need to know and will engage. They’ve opened up to me about things that are big recently so I thought we were moving forward but I don’t know. So them ignoring my need for reassurance sucks. Also I live across the country from them but we see each other at least twice a year. We do have a strong bond but words of affirmation is not there"

Ohh wow I thought you were one too.. oh wow you’re a male Pisces stuck on an Aries? Get out now. They love the ego stroke and most of them are immature and insecure so they like the attention and enjoy your depth. Omg Gemini moon ugh I love it ahh your Aries mercury that makes sense. You have energy to deal with the fire ok so you probably feel she understands you. 
But if she’s not committing leave because it’s not worth the hassle I have a lot of Aries female friends but they have water moons so they’re a little milder but they can be vicious. Intense, can have hookups easily and not get stuck on someone. whereas I feel like Pisces do but then your gem moon might be detached too so idk.

Diff places that tends to be my experience.
Our languages are diff but if they are emotionally aware (both parties) and can hold space then that’s a beautiful thing. I was with a Leo sun Scorpio moon - it could have worked out but they were not right for me and they played into their stereotypical low vibe traits. Me being conscious of that and doing work myself Pisces didn’t play into the “fixer” tendencies. We have free will don’t write someone off completely because of their sign - be aware of those tendencies and if they play into them, you communicate what doesn’t sit well with you and if they don’t change then it’s not a fit."
