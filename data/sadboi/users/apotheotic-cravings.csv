However, it would be jarring as hell to show up to a formal place of communal grieving and find a Chuck e cheese playhouse in front of you, so if you do plan to do this, you’ve got to inform the people attending.

I think the separate funeral idea would work, though. Different people need to grieve differently. You shouldn’t take away someone else’s way of coping just because it’s boring to you- but that doesn’t mean they should disrespect you or your brothers wishes either."
