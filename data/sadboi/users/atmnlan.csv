knitting,ezeva35,t3_d0qbcb,1567869285.0,What are you going to use to block it? Iâ€™m knitting a blanket as well and I have no idea how to block such a huge things. And what are the dimensions of your blanket?

Anxiety,euo991z,t3_cgxdrr,1563938855.0,"Maybe consider hanging curtains or something around your bed to make it seem smaller. I used to like to best in my bed, make a nest out of blankets and then cozy in with a blanket on top. And maybe noise canceling headphones could help with the noise?"
BipolarReddit,eugc402,t3_cg2iq3,1563804839.0,"I never realized how triggering boredom was, but my god it sets off my anxiety and everything else like crazy. Find a hobby to do, not just something like watching tv all day. Go somewhere different everyday or so. It might help."
Anxiety,eugajt5,t1_eufzgs5,1563803886.0,Iâ€™m the same way with sensing it. I got into a car crash a few days ago and went from 0-100 for the first time and it was almost worse.
raisedbynarcissists,euclctg,t3_cflx2t,1563678446.0,My mom all through my teenage years and especially after I graduated high school wouldnâ€™t let me do anything but stay with her in the living room and watch tv with her. She made it incredibly difficult to hang out with people and told me I wouldnâ€™t be any good in any of the things I wanted to do with my future. Now that Iâ€™m 21 and married I have no idea what I like to do or how to socialize.
bipolar,eucl2f9,t1_eucjboa,1563678197.0,"Iâ€™m going to be staying with my grandma. My husband is military so it doesnâ€™t affect anything in that concern, heâ€™ll still have a place to live. If I ended up leaving the relationship (which is just overwhelming even with nothing happening) I would save up for my own place."
Anxiety,eu9xp27,t3_cfgoz6,1563593980.0,"It may be for the best that you wait for a psych appointment. In my experience its not the greatest letting your normal doctor deal with something like this. I was given benzos as my first anxiety med which is a huge leap over some milder, non-addictive medications like the one Iâ€™m on now. She may not be comfortable prescribing them and I doubt it was her trying to hurt you in any way."
BipolarReddit,eu9xgm7,t3_cfgp5a,1563593766.0,"I had the same issue, turned out my battery was dirty so the connection kept cutting out. But it was stressful for sure when Iâ€™d go out to go to work and my car wouldnâ€™t start."
MentalHealthSupport,etrlmvt,t1_etr1wbk,1563123820.0,"Just take it one day at a time, maybe find some internet friends if youâ€™re open to that? Might be easier at first. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m thinking of doing"
Anxiety,etqa8i7,t1_etq9wm3,1563077488.0,"I canâ€™t even do that. I end up not replying because it makes me panic. Not because I canâ€™t help them, but because Iâ€™m scared theyâ€™ll do something and itâ€™ll be my fault, or that Iâ€™ll have to talk them out of doing something."
bipolar,etq7zm9,t3_ccxcpy,1563075454.0,"Iâ€™ve done both. Inpatient is typically only for about a week to stabilize someone in danger. Outpatient (which I end up having to do after inpatient) can be either PHP (partial hospitalization) or IOP (Intensive Outpatient). Generally thereâ€™s very little difference in outpatient services. Theyâ€™re both group therapies, generally get a free lunch, IOP just goes for less time during the day. The difference between outpatient and just having a normal therapist psychiatrists is that youâ€™re there generally 3-6 days a week learning about mental illness, coping skills, healthy habits, etc."
MentalHealthSupport,etpvbzd,t3_ccvfn0,1563065580.0,Iâ€™m going through the same thing. I used to have a big group of friends in high school and now I donâ€™t have anyone. I did manage to make one friend where I live now and then they had to move away.
ptsd,etpolix,t3_ccsgd1,1563060804.0,"My husband just yelling to be funny triggers me, but yelling during arguing or slamming doors puts me right back to being home with my mom who was mentally/emotionally abusive. And Iâ€™ll be anxious for a while afterwards"
MentalHealthSupport,et40jus,t3_c9x6zt,1562442174.0,"Sounds about right. People donâ€™t get discharged on weekends, it was the same for me. A couple extra days might not hurt though just to keep figuring stuff out."
AskReddit,et386j6,t3_c9ptp3,1562429420.0,"Getting an NG tube out in to pump my stomach after  a suicide attempt. And then again when they tried putting in a 2nd one and it felt like the tube was pushing my teeth out. They had said they might need to put my under but decided to wait and do the tubes first, and I wish I had just been asleep."
