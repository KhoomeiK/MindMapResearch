When my grandpa passed away, my grandma was in so much pain. Seeing her body shaking, her eyes filled with tears... It just broke my heart and I couldn't bare it. So I went to her and started asking her about grandpa, about the good times that they had together, what he was like when he was young,... The tears never stopped the whole time she was telling me his stories, but she seemed to be in so less pain."

relationship_advice,eu2ait6,t3_cecxor,1563385873.0,"I think it would have been so much better had you just tapped her on the shoulder when you first found out about her nights at the gym. That's what I would have done.

Come up to her and surprisingly say something like 'I didn't know you work out here. What a surprise. You look amazing by the way!'. I figured she would feel caught off guard at first, but mostly just because she doesn't want anybody to find out about it. 

Then you could casually go away and let her finish her workout, saying something like ""Well I'd better leave you to it. I'm gonna go make my life a living hell on the treadmill so I can sleep. See you at home babe."" Maybe give her a kiss on the cheek. Then go mind your own business. She'll probably be confused but she'll not feel threatened or caught red handed.

After that, just be normal about it. Don't talk about it until she brings it up. Keep doing your things and be loving and affectionate as I imagine you already are. She'll come to you when she feels it's the right time.

Oh and you're story is just lovely!"
