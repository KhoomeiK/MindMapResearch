We used to average maybe 20 people on a busy day - I've never seen more than 24, I think I've heard of a 35 person day. We're down to maybe 3-6 patients a day. Hours haven't been cut at all. One of us can take an extra day off a week of we want (which we've both taken advantage of), but otherwise we legitimately sit in the empty lab in an empty building and do whatever we can to entertain ourselves for 10 hours a day. I know I should be grateful to have this job, grateful for the income, and especially for getting paid to sit here and play on my phone, but... I honestly would rather go without the pay and be at home with my children, working on all the homeschooling I now have to do since school is closed for the year, or babysitting my niece who's parents have to work, but who's daycare has been closed for weeks and will continue to be closed for who knows how much longer, instead of my sister, brother in law, and mother having to each take a day off a week to watch her, plus my day off and then a random family or friend watching her the remaining day."

AskWomen,fgn45me,t3_ez9w3y,1580937361.0,"Pretty sure he was my soul mate. He came along right when I needed him the most. I was going through literal hell - my husband was abusive and I finally had enough and had him arrested, so I was going through everything associated with that and both my and my husband's chain of commands treating me like actual garbage for daring to speak ul after he nearly killed me. He worked a different shift than me, but we met through some twist of fate and instantly hit it off. He was well aware of everything going on and went out of his way to show me that men weren't all like that and... Long story short, he was an amazing friend when I needed one most, and honestly set the standard that I try to hold other men since up to. 

The timing was just always against us being serious. I moved back home when I got out of the military, which was 5 hours away. We still saw each other every other weekend when I had to be out there, but it wasn't really anything to build a relationship on - and no way I would move back to the same city as my abuser. When he got stationed a few states away about a year later, he asked me to go with him and give us a try, but by then I was talking to someone where I was. He went, met and married someone who turned out to be trash; I stayed and had a kid with someone who wasn't right for me at all. I wonder sometimes if I should've just gone, how different my life would be... If we would've been happy. 

We kept in touch for years afterwards, on and off. I still have voicemails on my phone from him - one telling me to have a great day because I deserved nothing less and to ""smile, damnit, because I said so"" and the other asking me to call because he just really needed me - It was the first time anyone had ever said that they ""needed"" me, and honestly might still be the only time. 

Anyway, last I heard, he was out of the military, graduating business school, starting up a business, and getting ready to marry wife #3. I sincerely hope it worked out for him, and I like to think I haven't heard anything in a few years because he's insanely happy and not looking back on old times like I do."

Equestrian,fek6e4g,t1_fejsi65,1579193562.0,"So, she is housed at a non-profit for veterans with PTSD. She was actually a gift to me from the owner/founder. She got her from an internet adoption auction, because she's a Kiger (and they are pretty highly coveted). When she went to pick her up in another state (Mississippi, I believe) they also had horses that hadn't been adopted yet, so she picked up a 2 year old for $25 for another guy. Honestly, I'd recommend that. The internet ones are usually flashier, but they also usually end up going for more expensive. And that way you can see them in person, gauge personalities. 

Trainers... We've had a few mustang trainers come through and volunteer their time, and the owner is a TIP trainer. You can also search for Tip trainers near you... The mustangs are started with basics with them and then adopted out. But, it's entirely possible for someone to do it on their own, with enough research and even joining Facebook groups and asking for advice. I highly recommend joining them anyway, just because it's super informative. (I just searched mustangs, but a few I have are BLM internet adoption, titled BLM mustangs, the BLM mustang family, trainer incentive program - TIP, heart of the west mustang horse adoption/burros/tip trainers/adopters, and then search for extreme mustang makeover - it's a completion where people train a mustang in 100 days and compete, then the horses are auctioned off) 

As for when we got them home... These two are young (2 and 3 years old) and are pretty chill. My friend was laying down with his the second day, and they still nap together all the time. He's like a little teddy bear. This girl is a little bossy, but she's so confident that absolutely nothing fazes her. Even the first time we had someone on her back or put a saddle on, she didn't even flinch. However, some older mustangs on the farm (7+ year old stallions turned geldings) have been much harder. They've been there a year, and have finally gotten over their fears. We got them saddled and had someone on their backs for the first time a few months ago, at right about a year of being here. However, one of those had some extra trauma - he got stuck in a chute and had a huge gash down his hip and they thought they were going to have to euthanize him. Another was just a fearful guy who snorted at everything that scared him, but he finally has overcome it and is such a sweetheart. And the other guy is a perfect gentleman under saddle, wasn't as fearful as the other guys, he's just... pushy. On the ground, he will absolutely bite the snot out of you if you aren't watching him.

I wouldn't trade the experience for the world. There's something just absolutely soul warming about a wild animal choosing to follow you around and wanting to be near you."

Slightly longer because I absolutely learned horse genetics just for fun:  Kiger mustangs have been curated to keep Spanish influences, including certain types of builds and the dun gene. She got the red color from being chestnut based, and then got the cool mane and tail highlights, a dark stripe down her spine, and the leg markings (little horizontal stripes above her knee, which fade into darker lower legs) from dun.

I noticed this pic made her legs look darker than they are. I definitely don't have hundreds of pics of here, so here's some better ones: [https://imgur.com/a/7J1QkQt](https://imgur.com/a/7J1QkQt)"

Equestrian,feggw1v,t3_ep14in,1579092358.0,"I don't know how this works where you are, but I volunteer/go to a place for equine therapy. Mine is completely unstructured - we do whatever we want to do with our horse. I guess I should give some details. This place was founded for veterans with PTSD and TBI. It started with some rescue horses saved from slaughter, but has settled now into pairing veterans with wild mustangs. Veterans get a wild mustang fresh off the range, and we work with them to earn trust, train, and gentle. These creatures have been through something extremely traumatic too: being separated from their herd by something terrifying (helicopter), and have to deal with a while new ""normal."" (Mustangs have to have population control, and this is the way the government chooses to do it.) It's not different from us being traumatized and having to deal with new normals. But it's more than that for us. It's also the camaraderie with other veterans, the understanding and instant family we gain with the other people there, the unwavering support. It's helping with chores: scooping poop or feeding, stacking hay bales, manual labor until your body screams - a very different kind of therapy. 

I can honestly say it's helped my CPTSD, anxiety, and depression a lot when I go religiously. Work has gotten in the way lately, and then I'm too tired from forcing myself to work and... It's a vicious cycle. But it has done a ton for me.

But, I guess I should stress this - this place is probably completely unlike any other in the world, so my input might be super unhelpful to you. I've ridden a few times, but that's not the focus. I'm happy just to go and hang out, hide out in my girl's stall, or get snuggles.

And given the amount of pain I was in, it absolutely made a huge difference to me. I digress. 

NTA. It's a doctor. It's just a job to them. I promise, not a single male doctor is getting off on the uncomfortable circumstances that are pelvic exams. They are not at all sexy. And seriously, why does anyone beside you get a say in anything to do with your body?"
CPTSD,fedtors,t3_eokifq,1579019670.0,"Every single morning. It's a chant - ""I don't want to do this anymore. I'm too exhausted. I just need a freaking break. I can't live this life anymore."""
Veterans,fedt72l,t1_fedmzhs,1579019370.0,"I was diagnosed with PTSD before I got out, so when I applied, I used that diagnosis and then the years of therapy and meds I've been on since. I would start with getting some sort of diagnosis from somewhere. 

Also, one of the things I submitted in my claim was a letter, retelling all of the events that happened and what affect they've had on my life since. My mother also wrote one to support it, with her accounts of what happened and how's its affected me.

I'm so sorry you have this struggle, and I wish you the best in the future. Feel free to shoot me a message - I have some friends who helped me in the process and I may be able to pass along some hard won wisdom from them."
Veterans,fedjrih,t1_fedhdyv,1579013285.0,Thank you so much for the support. It honestly means a lot.
Veterans,feda5y9,t3_eohuki,1579005369.0,"I always struggle with this. I am a veteran. I have PTSD. Yet, I never left the US. My trauma happened at home, and unfortunate actions taken by my and other superiors in the military during the aftermath compounded my trauma - to the point where the VA has given me a disability rating for it. I waited over a decade before filing because in my mind it wasn't really service related. It took several people, including a handful of professionals, telling me to file to do so and I still didn't expect anything. Even with all this, I don't often say that I'm a veteran or I have PTSD in sentences together because everyone immediately assumes military + PTSD = combat, and I don't pretend to have anything near what it takes for that."

toastme,fdxg5fo,t1_fdtqr6d,1578768423.0,Definitely trying to. Knowing I have support no matter what I do really helps. Thank you so much for checking in. That really means a lot.

CPTSD,fdp344e,t3_emfwjo,1578618858.0,"For me, peace or silence gives me too much time to be in my own head. I over think and over analyze every situation, I stress about things, I think back to things I could/should have done or said differently... A million paths in my head all basically existing because of the belief that I can never do anything right, or I'm not good enough. Beliefs my abuser beat into me. So, I find myself doing whatever I can to stay busy, or to sleep through the quiet times, because sometimes even distracting myself with tasks isn't enough to shut out the bad thoughts. So no, you're not alone."
CPTSD,fdp22ti,t3_emiiyj,1578618154.0,"You're not alone, but it's not even chores or normal tasks for me. I can't even bring myself to watch Netflix or anything enjoyable anymore, because I just don't have the energy. Don't even get me started on cleaning... I can't tell you how long it's been. And my license is about to expire. But can I be bothered with doing anything about any of this? No. I called out of work and spent the whole day in bed.

I keep hoping it will get better after X. Or after Y is passed, I will do this. Once I finish Z, I'll clean. I even procrastinate my procrastination. But, here's hoping things get easier for you soon!!"

Be gentle with yourself always, but especially while you are relearning how to live healthy and see the world differently than you have. I bet you have the kind of smile that lights up a room. Share it with the world when you're ready to. Best wishes on your journey!"

Don't stop fighting, girl. You may have been in an accident, but you're still here. You can do this, just hold your head up! Sending you virtual hugs from a complete stranger"
toastme,fdp0otf,t3_emi3j7,1578617222.0,"It's always hard to readjust to civilian life. Try to find veteran groups to hang out with - it's amazing how fast you can find that camaraderie you're missing.  But give yourself time. You will find people to connect with again, it just takes a while to find them, or to get your brain out of military mode. You got this shit, brother!"
toastme,fdp02mc,t1_fdosybh,1578616811.0,"To make it short, my PTSD is from domestic abuse that cost me one child's life (miscarried a twin), seriously endangered another (other twin was born 3 months premature), and very nearly killed me, as well as trauma that was made worse by the military's handling of the aftermath. We were both enlisted and because I am female, they protected him and very literally attacked me."

She even offered me alternatives to make things easier for me, and so I could stay there because she doesn't want to lose me. So now I have to really sit down with all my options and decide my next steps, figure out what will be best for me."
toastme,fdlqu5f,t1_fdkwswm,1578530309.0,"That's always been the hardest part for me, looking at it as a medical issue not unlike a broken bone. I'm definitely having to train myself out of the ""it's all in my head"" mindset. Because, yea, it is in my head technically, but it's also a lot more complicated than that."
toastme,fdlqlx8,t1_fdl9a26,1578530151.0,Thank you for the advice. I'm looking into it now!

I wasn't trying to say I was or scold you or anything, I was just trying to pass along a little hard won knowledge. Thank you for your kindness, though. I hope things are well for you. Military life is hard, even for those who don't serve directly."
