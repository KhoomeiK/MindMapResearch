- Storyline gives the penthouse owner a cool exclusive car that not many people will even know exist (shame that the machine guns are laughably bad)

- Storyline also unlocks a one-time prep for the casino heists

- Fast travel option, even has Paleto Bay

- Can stock up on free champagne (if you don't know what it does, then it means it's rare and you will want to surprise people with that cool free emote that barely anyone knows!)

- Ms Baker as a phone contact gives you access to a couple of cool things:
-- Cars that spawn next to you, perfect when your CEO and personal vehicles are on cooldown
-- The limousine that spawns next to you, and the driver takes you anywhere you want in a timely manner. Perfect to travel AFK from Paleto Bay to Los Santos.

We typically call this the *stressed* beat. Here's a great way to think about counting them with ideas we already know using words about foods. A slash separates the beats in a measure (like 4/4), a period shows that beat is subdivided into multiple notes-per-beat (like 6/8), and capital letters show where we put that stress in a typical measure per time signature. 

Typical Time Signatures | Word or Phrase
-----|-----
2/4 (2 beats per measure, first note gets the stress) | App / le
3/4 | Ba / na / na
4/4 | Wa / ter / mel / on
6/8 (6 beats per measure, first and *fourth* beats get the stress) | Cab . er . net /  Sau . vig . non 

But what about some stranger time signatures?

Weird Time Signatures | Word or Phrase
-----|-----
5/4 | Re / frid / ger / a / tor
3/8 | Ba . na . na
4/8 | Cheer . i . os / Milk
5/8 (5 beats per measure, but the first and third beats get the stress) | Caf . e / Ter . i . a 
5/8 (5 beats per measure, but the first and *fourth* beats get the stress) | Ham . bur . ger / Ket . chup
7/8 (7 beats per measure, but the first and *fifth* beats get the stress)| Fet . tuc . ci . ne / Al . fre . do
8/8 | Straw . ber . ry / Va . nil . la / Milk . shake
9/8 | Straw . ber . ry / Va . nil . la / Cho . co . late
25/8 [(no, seriously)](https://old.reddit.com/r/Vulfpeck/comments/dhbmgl/stumbled_upon_this_video_of_cory_wong_teaching_a/) | Give . me . my . chi . pot . le / Give . me . my chi . pot . le / I . want . chips . [Silent Beat] / I . want . guac / Give . me . my chi . pot . le 

Hopefully that helps clear up a bit about your question. They basically define how we group chunks of a measure and whether or not they're intended to be played as individual beats (4/4, where four *quarter* notes make a measure, with the first quarter note taking the stress) or a single beat subdivided into multiple beats (6/8, where six *eighth* notes make a measure, with the first and fourth beats taking the stress). Sometimes the same time signature sounds differently depending on where we put that stress (5/8 being either Cafe/Teria or 12-123, vs 5/8 being Banana/Apple or 123-12) to give the piece a different feeling.

You may wonder why three measures of 3/4 can be

Ba / na / na | Ba / na / na | Ba / na / na 

but then how is it any different from a single 9/8 measure of

Straw . ber . ry / Va . nil . la / Cho . co . late

Or even why are 3/8 and 3/4 any different at all when the first note gets the stress in both and there's only 3 ""beats"" per measure? 

They don't have to be! They're not necessarily fundamentally different. It's often a stylistic choice of how the composer/arranger wants the music to *look* on the page and the tempo to be counted. In terms of feel, the song could be written either way and sound the exact same to anyone not paying attention, but sometimes it's just easier to read and write in particular time signatures, so we stick with what is easiest."

Steam,fn5er14,t1_fn56iyo,1586662948.0,Nope! I've got games I paid for back in 2004 that are on my account still. You're set :)
ADHD,fn5crkb,t3_fzno6y,1586661500.0,"There's the saying ""Nobody on their deathbed ever wished they'd spent more time working"". All of those things sound really worthwhile and it sounds like you had a great day. Taking care of yourself is also a productive thing, even if it doesn't feel like it at the time. 

What about doing 15 minutes of school work before going to bed tonight? Would at least getting more than 0% done today make you feel better?"
pcgaming,fn5bu16,t3_fznxpf,1586660832.0,"Hi! First things first, when asking multiple questions like this, make sure to put a full line between your questions, otherwise Reddit will put it as one big block of text like you've got now. Bonus points if you start them with a * so they're bulleted. :)

What kind of gamer are you? 

- Full-time employed PC and occasionally console gamer. I have a PS4 but it doesn't get used much. I switch between keyboard+mouse and controller for PC games depending on what makes the game feel best. 

What do you look for in a game? 

* Something that's fun and doesn't feel like a massive grind. Requiring me to gain skill is okay but relentlessly doing the same things over and over just to progress doesn't appeal to me as much. Intriguing games with good characters (GTA V, Life is Strange), puzzle games that push me to think in different ways (Portal 1 and 2, Braid, SUPERHOT, Superliminal), and games that have satisfying game mechanics to play (Doom, Rocket League, Super Meat Boy). Also Party-style games like Jackbox Party Pack, Speedrunners, and Ultmate Chicken Horse are great for groups.

Which games are your favorite and why? 

* See the list above for some examples, plus racing games as there's something zen about the repetition of them (despite what I said above). Portal is still a game I'll replay once every couple of years because it's just so perfectly crafted. 

Do you consider gaming a sport? 

* To some degree. While gaming is non-physical they still require fast thinking, specific skillsets based on the rules of the game, and encourage competition among people who share that skillset. Especially right now with coronavirus in full swing, eSports are something that can be televised and teams be showcased in the same way that we do with traditional sports. Other than the raw physicality, there isn't much difference between traditional sports and eSports when you get down to it.

When did you start playing video games? 

* About age 4-5 on my dad's Atari, and then NES when that came out. I've been a recovering addict since
 
What location do you play in? (living room, bedroom, etc.) 

* Living room on a PC hooked up to an HDTV or in the bedroom/office on a traditional monitor. The living room works much better for when friends are over and the office works better for games where I want a keyboard and mouse, but otherwise they're about equivalent.

What consoles do you have and which ones do you use most frequently? 

* PS4, Xbox 360, and Nintendo 3DS. I most frequently use PC though as this gives me the option of purchasing almost any game that isn't a console exclusive, the sales for games are often much cheaper than on console, and I can play nearly anything regardless of the age of the game, including emulating retro consoles.

When do you play? 

* At night after work, on weekends, and when friends come by, however I don't necessarily game every single day 

Do you have a routine? 

* Not really. I play what I want when I want and when it strikes my fancy.

Do you play with others? If so, how many people? 

* Yes, usually 1-3 depending on the game, or more if we do something that's a play and pass game or a trivia type game

How do you alter your routine when you play with other people? 

* I try to spend less time making big decisions and keep the game flowing for the sake of everyone.

Have you attended an official gaming event? Which one? Tell me about it! 

* Yes - I helped host the inaugural AppalachLAN in the student union and went to every one until I graduated, as well as going to other events such as the gaming tournaments at SuperCon/GalaxyCon. I have not gone to any of the 200+ people events  

Who is considered a true gamer in your opinion?

* Anyone who really enjoys games. While I'm hesitant to say ""mobile gaming"" on Android/iOS, even these have their own massive followings now. Gaming is so widespread that anyone who enjoys their time in games and regularly comes back to them is someone I'd consider a gamer."
htpc,fn0p1o6,t1_fmzh7nh,1586546035.0,"I've found that while the K400 line of keyboards aren't the best for typing on, they're WAY better than the Rii Keyboards since you can actually two-hand type on them and the trackpad works decently enough.

I picked up a [wireless mechanical keyboard a year or so ago](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/drevoblademaster/drevo-blademaster-ultimate-keyboard-with-programma/updates) that doesn't have the 10 key numpad for when I need to do real work on my HTPC and already had a Microsoft wireless Trackball that I use alongside it, but for 90% of my uses the Logitech K400 just works and is one single piece to move around. I even picked up a second for the bedroom. 

They're well worth the money for a proper HTPC in my experience."
SteamController,fmyjbhh,t3_fxg7el,1586487539.0,"I really wanted to see paddles or buttons added for additional functionality, not just duplicated functionality like we've seen with SCUF and StrikePack. I'm glad to assume gyro has stuck around, as has the touch pad, but it definitely still feels like a letdown."
