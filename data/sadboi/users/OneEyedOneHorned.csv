If you didn't legally act against him, then a new case needs to be opened and that wouldn't include his past crimes if they weren't reported at the time.

Do you have a support system such as friends and family who know about this person? If you don't, I suggest calling friends and family over the phone and reconnecting with people to remind yourself that you aren't alone. You may have moved but you do still have people who care about you even if you are physically separated from them. This person, the stalker, does not have power over you unless you let them.

If you can, find a counseling service either online or over the phone to help you with the legal side of things and also with your anxiety. They can help you with the shelter in place and covid anxieties and also dealing with any potential further contact that this person tries. Having a counselor as a third party will also help you legally.

It isn't that this person has too much free time. It's that they're an asshole and can't move the hell on with their life or let anyone else move on either. They're a terrible person.

We can realize that this is true and we can take steps in our every day lives. You're 33? I'm 30. We didn't get this way because god made us fat. We got this way because we made decisions every day. Sitting on the couch is a decision. Playing video games for 8 hours is a decision (my decision. I did that today.) It isn't healthy and it's a decision that impacts a lot more than just today. We can talk all we want about percentages and statistics but what that does is draw the focus away from ourselves and on to the greater problem of society when we, ourselves, are the focus of our lives. What do I want and what do I need (really, truly, actually need?) What anxiety do I want to remove from my life and what can I do today to make that happen?

My previous therapist just told me that you get into a routine where you set up doing something (art, writing, anything really) and then you work on bringing yourself back over and over again. You work on being in control. These things, the tea, the music, having clothes that remind us of the here and now, these are tools that help us and remind us to refocus. It is a struggle and it's one we just keep working at. I have Adderall and even with that, it's still a struggle. I've taken it before and instead of doing what I needed to do, I reorganized our entire bookshelf one day and just played with my bead collection another.

Freak out, over-react (send you kid to a psych ward immediately, or get angry at them when they are angry at themselves), and you might be encouraging them to hide their selfharm from you and lie. Honesty when it comes to minors is the best policy. It is safer, allows the parent to monitor any damage a minor is doing, develops better trust between a parent and a minor, and by default, then will make a minor want to selfharm less as they feel they have a more supportive and stable home environment with better communication.

Case in point, my parents were horribly strict and then were happy and mildly confused when I joined the theatre department in school and went on to win awards in State Speech competitions. ""Wow!"" they said back then, ""How did you get to be such a good actor?!""

I had tons of practice. I had been horrifically depressed for the majority of my life and I lied the entire time. I'm not in acting anymore as it was ruined for me by one man who is dead now. That's a bit off topic but people don't get better from selfharm by being monitored or having their sharps taken away.

You aren't being a sensitive little bitch. Those are your parents's words but it does not make them true. There are differences about you that your parents don't understand yet. They might eventually once they understand that these differences aren't that big of a deal, we gay and transgender people aren't that different from anyone else, and that how we talk to each other does matter. It sounds like your parents have problems in how they talk to each other. As a kid and not a parent, it is not your responsibility to fix their relationship for them. It is also definitely not your fault no matter what they ever say. I've been there and have been blamed for my parents' fighting but their problems are not your fault.

It sounds like your mom and your dad are having significant problems with this quarantine thing. Do you have a church to which your family belongs? I'm asking because some churches have set up online services and web services for online family counseling. While it may not be a good idea to reach out to church people about being gay and trans, it may be a good idea to reach out to church elders about your parents fighting, your mom telling you that she wishes she never had you (my dad did that before, it took me years to forgive him and I do not speak to him anymore), and that your parents are having problems during quarantine and that they need help. If church is not an option, do you have online access to healthcare services? Some families let their kids message doctors, reup on their prescriptions, and other things like that. Online therapy has become immensely popular lately and online family therapy is an option. A family therapist would be interested in speaking to your parents about how they're dealing with quarantine and how, as a family, you can all reduce stress during this trying time.

I know that's a lot of ifs but online services have expanded quite a bit lately and if you can get access, it could be very helpful in getting your parents to calm down. Being gay and trans is hard WITHOUT a pandemic outside. More power to you and may the patience of a thousand dogs with treats on their noses be yours."
COVIDTraumaSupport,fp8fdl5,t3_g9io3n,1588390893.0,"Alternatives to selfharm can be literally anything that does not hurt yourself or another living being. The coping action does not even need to make sense. I am almost 6 years clean from selfharm and here's a list I just came up with off the top of my head:

-Vacuum a room to dance music. Quality of vacuuming or dancing do not matter.

-Make a fort out of the couch and listen to spooky ghost stories on youtube.

-Bake a mug cake in the microwave

-Roll around in the grass outside (check for dog poo first and wear a mask)

-Got legos? Build a Gundam with boobs. Build a dinosaur. Make them fight or drink tea.

-Slap a tree.

-Scream at the sky.

-Throw mud at your car and then wash the car

-Doodle your favorite animals' butts

-Search your favorite sitcom or cartoon for memes

-Make art no matter what kind, what it's made of, or why

-Have a spa day

-Have a spaghetti day

-Gather sticks, pretty leaves, discarded branches, flowers and make a seasonal wreath

-Practice making animal noises

-Punch a pillow.

-Make bread and knead the crap out of it."

Cutters,fp883yq,t3_gb654v,1588385896.0,"You can't make your brother's choices for him. His cutting and your parents' unawareness may annoy the shit out of you but you have no control over these things. What you do have control over is your relationship with your brother and what you do with your mutual time with him. You can let your brother know that you care, that you think about him a lot, that you want him to take care of himself, that you want to understand, and that you are there for him if he needs help, a person to listen to his problems/fears/anxieties/or to just be a friend. I don't know his motivations and I won't pretend to know. People hurt themselves for a lot of different reasons and often it boils down to being unable to control their environment/body/life so they find a way to control themselves, their body, and their life even if the exact way is harmful, painful, and ultimately dangerous. Letting your brother know that you are there for him is another way of helping him gain back that sense of control because you're offering him support that he doesn't realize exists. You cannot make him stop or make his decisions for him. You can decide to make his life better by choosing to strengthen your bond as a family."

He called suicides ""self murders"" because he was a fuckin nut. A usurer is ""a person who lends money at unreasonably high rates of interest."" I had to google that and wtf that has to do with violence....

In this circle of hell, suicides are entombed into trees and harpies feed on the trees which I guess causes suffering forever but compared to everything else in Dante's Inferno, being a tree seems waaaay better than everything else and what did a tree ever do to Dante? On Last Judgement Day, I guess people are supposed to get their bodies back but the suicidal trees get their bodies hung from their branches which is pretty metal."
dechonkers,fp5caec,t1_fp4av11,1588324001.0,"Hmm, can you capitalize on the lazy asshole part? Perhaps moving the dry food out of her reach either up where she can't climb onto a cat tower, bookshelf, table, or somewhere the other two cats regularly can reach but somewhere Poose never goes. It may encourage her to move a little more if she's very food motivated and when she does get more mobile, I would suggest you leave out less food for all of the cats. I have a slow feeder bowl for mine so we can leave food out but it makes her root around, move the little bits around so she can reach them, and then she gets bored/tired, and will walk away leaving food in the bowl. Slow feeder bowls let cats know that food is available but that they don't need to inhale it. Also putting it up high would make them climb for it so Poose would be physically unable to reach it for the time being. She might eventually be motivated because she smells food but can't reach it so she might move around more and eventually get to it. Really it's the slow feeder bowl that helped me with my chonky cat because she calmed the hell down."

dechonkers,fp49uj9,t1_fp2v7y0,1588294579.0,"This is the correct answer. There are 3 cat body types and they're mainly based on bone structure, siberian/maine coon, domestic, and sphynx/siamese. Obviously this doesn't cover breed differences but if we're talking bone structure these are the 3 types. Siberian and maine coon have larger heads, larger paws, and long bodies. They can range from 11-25 lbs, always with feline males on the larger side. Domestic cats are normally 8-10 lbs but domestic cats are rarely purely bred so depending on length from nose to tail, most are 8-14lbs. Persians and siamese are incredibly slim frame cats with small heads, paws, and while they can be long, their bones are very light weight leading to impressive jumping and climbing skills. Small breed cats like this tend to be healthy from 7 to 12lbs. My friend once had a runt Siamese who was 6lbs and she could run. Weight and coat quality are the best judgements of cat diet."
dechonkers,fp48rt1,t1_fp3vn86,1588293967.0,"The cheapest vets are veterinary technician schools because a checkup for a cat could be as cheap as $20. They will likely do unnecessary things such as checking the cat's teeth, combing it, and other things simply to get the students used to handling many different cats, working with pet parents/customers, and in my experience, veterinary technician schools tend to be more fun than taking a cat to a veterinarian because of the student experience. The cat might actually be more tolerant of nail clipping, teeth cleaning, and other procedures simply due to being handled very lovingly by students who want to do well and handle adorable floofs."
StopSelfHarm,fp45w2i,t3_gb4srq,1588292314.0,"I am not a therapist but I am clean from selfharm, done it a long time, yadda yadda. Your instinct to want to talk to the kid's parents is very good. Parents knowing who their kids that young are talking to online is a VERY good thing and while that family is not your responsibility, the environment that your child is exposed to is your responsibility. I would be open with your kid about why you want to talk to their friend's parents. It isn't because you don't trust their friend but rather you want to make sure that they aren't being exposed to potentially emotionally/physically violent material, abusive content (especially family abuse which in a facetime or online video setting can be much more graphic, I mean NSFL than NSFW due to the emotional context.) I'm not saying that people who selfharm are abused but children who do are more likely to come from households that are abusive either physically or emotionally. If their friend is showing them blood or selfharm of any form on camera that should not be acceptable. It is your child's choice what they expose themselves to as eventually they will be making these decisions on the internet AND if they want to help friends who admit to selfharm, they need to learn how to set boundaries, both physical, online and offline, and verbal. It's wonderful that your child wants to help. It's important that your child understand the limits to the kind of help we can offer each other, how to spot toxic or unhealthy behavior, and when/how to reach out for resources for others in need."

I'm transgender and I had a coworker who was also transgender. The only thing she ever wanted to talk to me about was transgender issues, being transgender, and this transgender group she wanted me to attend with her. I did not go because I had a life outside (before quarantine happened.) Once I quit that job, she would message me on facebook to send me memes about being transgender that she thought were funny. I stopped replying and slowly she did too. The last time she messaged me, she tried once again to talk about being transgender and that was it. It's literally her entire life. I can't change that for her but if one thing, one interest, or one trait make up a person's whole life, they have a problem. It doesn't matter if it's alcohol, sex, being Christian, being gay, being transgender, liking football, or hell, maybe they like beanie babies WAAAAY too much.
