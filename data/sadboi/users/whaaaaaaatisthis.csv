It might be crowded but they might also be able to connect you with some other shelters. You might not be looking for a shelter but consider it for the time being just so you can avoid getting into trouble with police. Can try family service centres also they might be able to provide some food also. Cc also cos now fasting period I know one of the Bishan ccs got distribute food in the evening for break fast. Pls pm if you need anything else I'm happy to help. But sorry I'm just a student so I don't have anything I can pay you to do.

I really hope that there can be some sort of explanation why u/ilovezam and u/bobcake got permabanned because I (and probably others) am confused. It would also be helpful to define grounds for banning users. For me, I would imagine that banning is a good way to keep redditors in the sub safe. I don't think ilovezam and bobcake meant anything malicious and was threatening any user, and they have also been incredibly polite and civilised in their communication. Which is why I don't really understand how they got banned. And in terms of low quality posts, I also don't feel a need for them to be removed. If a meme is uniformly bad, it just wouldnt get upvoted. Users can choose to just scroll by. It doesn't have to be decided by a group of people whether a post is low or high quality. On the other hand, I agree with the current rules, duplicated posts should be removed. Thanks again and hope you can share with us some updates :)"

GradSchool,fj4u02p,t3_fbbx3m,1583016857.0,":') my pi doesn't realise that I have depression. Maybe it's because I didn't tell him, but he doesn't seem to notice it either. Perhaps it's also because he's been mostly absent and we don't have a particularly close relationship because he doesn't gaf about my projects since they're not his interests (low impact factor haha). 

Certainly I have noticeable signs because people at my institute have asked if I am depressed. The only' depression related chat' he's had with me is him telling me that he was depressed during his own PhD, like it was a rite of passage. So maybe he also sees it as part and parcel of a PhD and depression is very much normalised and something people just needs to get over. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

But yea I'm on medications and receiving therapy atm. I don't expect him to be supportive in any way because I kind of expect very little from him. I'm glad tho that I have people around me in my institute who still gives a shit so I go to them for advice instead.

I've got lawyer and doctor friends who make similar comments. It's because people don't understand what grad school is and how different it is from studying. That said, you really need to adjust the way you view your siblings. Choosing to find a job and work is a very normal progression in life. Delaying work to do grad school is not as normal through the lens of the normal population. Just because you're smart and academic, it doesnt make you a better person than them. I agree that those comments sting but you gotta be more open to what others are thinking and communicate what your motivations for doing grad school are. If you tell them that by going to grad school it allows you to get the job you want, I'm sure they would be more receptive to what you're doing."
