But if I walk into a plastic surgeon's office I can immediately get a completely elective, aesthetic procedure under anaesthesia - many with higher risks than tubal ligation - without this conversation. Why?"

australia,fo5ro3o,t1_fo59895,1587533578.0,"apologies, I'm not that smart and could be misunderstanding. But couldn't we make the same argument for any of these issues? Maybe if I wash my hands more, I'm convinced that it doesn't matter if I touch more things, because I'll just wash them later. Same for gloves. Or for social distancing - I'll go out more because I know that other people will be social distancing. This all seems very speculative. 

I haven't seen convincing evidence that mask wearing would disrupt social distancing. Aren't countries with regular mask wearing experiencing better outcomes? Doesn't the CDC in America promote mask wearing? 

I can't help but feel this is more of an issue of supply that's come back to bite the gov in the ass, because they misrepresented the efficacy of masks to try and handle a supply shortage."

I think if they only argued the 3rd point, about distribution, people would be fine with it. The other cons seem iffy. Why not practice all the parts of social distancing, don't touch your face, AND wear a mask if you have it? Especially perhaps if you have a home-made mask, so you don't affect the supply for medical personnel. Harm minimisation seems like a reasonable practice."

EatingDisorders,f4j6693,t1_f4ffa96,1571613654.0,"To my knowledge, this is what clinicians (at least in the Min/Maud) protocol claim. I'm happy to amend that claim if the literature says otherwise. 

While it seems like common sense, I don't think it's quite that simple. It's very hard to determine what the end point of refeeding is, especially if someone goes back and forth between restricting behaviours in recovery (which, tbh, who doesn't? I certainly did). It very much depends on the individual. Some will take longer, some won't.

People with anorexia often also don't get the normal signals to tell them when they're full or hungry, so that is difficult for them. Indeed, with both recovery eating and BED, the urge to eat doesn't at all stop once the stomach is full - I think many people can attest to that experience personally! 

In any case, that's why it's good to have a professional (ie. not me) - preferably someone well versed in eating disorders - to oversee all this."
EatingDisorders,f2e9xla,t3_dd5w3j,1570188161.0,"My tip? Don't stop.

After a period of anorexia, it is not really ""binge eating"" as we think of with BED (binge eating disorder). It's recovery eating. In fact, to my knowledge, if you \*ever\* had anorexia, even once, you are precluded from being diagnosed with BED. 

The ""willpower"" was your ED, and the fact that it's gone is a sign you're getting better. You will usually just binge as much as you need to. Any attempts to restrict will probably end up with you in a b/p cycle. I suggest checking out ""Minnie/Maud"" recovery protocols to help keep you on the path to recovery, and ideally speak to a doctor/nutritionist to monitor your (very normal and healthy) return to normal eating habits.

The fact that you have already started heading down this path is awesome, and you will doubt yourself and it will be super hard to accept some of the changes in your body, but you can do it. :D"

EatingDisorders,eu73lxh,t3_cetmv0,1563516900.0,"My family had a very similar reaction to my recovery. I used to have to go out and eat in public parks by myself because I couldn't do it in the house - they were so baffled by my anorexia recovery. There is NO need to be ashamed of the eating, because you are literally getting in the calories your body, likely, desperately needs. If you have ever restricted, your body is not only putting back on necessary weight but healing lots of internal damage - thus the need for more calories. 

Now, I noted that you said binge-eating is an issue. I believe that it is actually very difficult to be diagnosed with binge eating if you have EVER previously had a restrictive eating disorder. This is because normal recovery eating looks a lot like binge-eating. Of course, I don't know your personal situation. 

Perhaps if your family were educated on what to expect in recovery (and yes, there will be a lot of recovery eating!) they would be more sympathetic - especially the Minnie/Maud/homeodynamic methods. Unfortunately, we can't always count on our family to be there for us. I believe in you!"
