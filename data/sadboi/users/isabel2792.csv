AnxietyDepression,fht2rd7,t1_fhryu2t,1581869235.0,Thanks. He seemed to think that I was unphased or unbothered by it bc I was comforting him but it’s just my default to put others feelings ahead of my own and then when I’m alone I have no one there to comfort me. No one aware that I can barely feel my legs as I’m having an anxiety attack. I don’t wear my feelings on my sleeves and I try to hide my depression because I think deep down I feel no one would love me or stay if they knew how sad and disinterested in activities I actually am.
depression,f8oa111,t3_e17zxh,1574669587.0,That’s awesome! I’ve been the same with my room for a couple years. I clean up the clothes that need to be washed but I really need to get rid of stuff. I don’t want to become a hoarder. I’m going to try to clean tomorrow morning. Emphasis on try. Or at least wash my clothes.
depression,f8mqnc7,t1_f8m2dw4,1574633942.0,That sucks. I feel like the best people to read the subtle signs are our pets. My dog can read me like a book. It makes me feel better. I almost feel like he cries when he can tell I’m struggling. My dog is a godsend. My dog of 15 years was killed by an animal two years ago. Either a coyote or mountain lion jumped the fence. Killed him instantly with a broken neck. I nearly lost it. That was my source of comfort. Less than two weeks later I got my current dog. He’s a motivation for me. A life dependent on me keeping my stuff together. At least for him. And he comforts me. Sorry I just went on a tangent there.
depression,f8m17jb,t1_f8jzk1t,1574627246.0,It feels almost as if you’re the depressed patient and your own doctor at the same time. A war inside your brain. Plus it also never feels like the right time to inconvenience someone with my dark thoughts. Sometimes I wish I could just show on the outside how I feel on the inside. So they’d notice but that’s just not the case.
depression,f8htnmt,t1_f6w7dbl,1574580000.0,Omg that’s how I feel! When I try to discuss my emotions or let anyone in my own brain stops me and tells me why those thoughts and feelings are irrational and I end up talking myself out of saying anything.
depression,f8hrfff,t1_f5x1070,1574579014.0,I feel that way too. I can’t afford to be non functional. I break down in the privacy of my own room. And I cry myself to sleep sometimes. I just wish I could just stop. But it’s gives me anxiety to throw out the window my responsibilities. And I hate when people think I’m okay. I’m not okay. I’m less okay. And it gives me anxiety to think I’m less there for those that I love. I don’t want them to think I don’t care but I feel like I’m drowning myself. It scares me the lack of interest I have in things I used to love. It’s kills me to have to pretend. I feel like there’s something very wrong with me. And I just want these thoughts to go away. I hate feeling this way. But I’m also scared this version of me no one will have patience for. No one will understand. And I don’t want to cause them pain for that. Idk if that makes sense.
