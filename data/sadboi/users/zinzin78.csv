This is a good idea, and even just working towards this could be the kind of drive you need to get out of the depression. Having goals is what changed me from a severely suicidal depressive to someone that has achieved a great deal. 

I don't know anything about your financial situation so it is difficult for me to make any recommendations. But if you are not married you are free to do whatever you want to. Living and working overseas is a wonderful idea and there are other things you could do to make money as well.  Blogging/Vlogging about you putting yourself into a position to teach overseas and then what it is like to teach overseas seems like a good vlog and I would watch it. 

I've included to subreddits here for good reason. 

/r/personalfinance Go in there, post all of your financial information, debts, income, expenses and tell them what you want to do. They will help you plan and give you an idea of how to save so you can move overseas and teach. 

/r/minimalism Typically anyone with a lot of debt can benefit from living a minimalist lifestyle. If your goal is to move overseas and teach English then you don't need anything you currently have in terms of material possessions. Selling all of your stuff my help get you out of debt. 

Lastly, if I were you I would consider Ukraine as a possible place to teach English. You can buy a nice apartment in any of the big cities for $30,000+ So if you could sell everything a save your money you could move to a place with a nice apartment in a touristy area and not worry about paying rent. Other places are Peru, Moldova, Thailand, Philipines, Macedonia, and the list goes on. These are all places where you can live a good life for about $10,000 a year considering you own your home."

I believe this information is accurate but I might be wrong. 

The short answer is by international standards the average Ukrainian is slightly above the global poverty line. Extreme poverty would be around $720 a year, more than a tier-one pension in Ukraine. So elderly Ukrainians would meet the definition of 'extreme global poverty.' 

As an American I can only assume that Ukrainians pool their vacations together and travel in groups, lowing the cost per person of vacation expenses.  

&#x200B;

> Also do you guys have an idea about the average net worth of they ukrainian person? 

The average personal wealth of a Ukrainian is estimated at  $1,563. To put that into context It costs me about the same to fly from the U.S. to Ukraine for a holiday. Additionally, the average global net worth per person is around  $63,000. And the average salary of folks in my country stands at around $50,000. with a median net worth of $240,750. So context matters. 

So an American that had no expenses could buy a really nice apartment in Ukraine every year. Or we could pay for 12.5 Masters degrees. 

Here is some more context.

The Average American salary of $50,000 converted to UAH and put in a deposit account in Ukraine at 20% would equal  $10500 or 262181.11 Hyrivna or 27 times the average Ukrainian salary per year. 

So yes, by western standards the average Ukrainian is poor. 

But being in Ukraine the economy seems appropriate for the average income. My thoughts have always been that the minimum Ukrainian salary should be increased and the cost of good should rise accordingly. This way Ukrainian can benefit more from Foreign tourism dollars. 

There is no reason that I should be able to go on a 2-week vacation to Ukraine having pre-paid for my Apartment and airfare and be unable to spend $1,000 on food, drinks, and fun. To me, it just seems like a wasted opportunity. If it costed me twice as much to go to Ukraine every year I would still go and it would still be an inexpensive vacation."
