I believe that where I started to buckle down and start a diet. I started with little things, like cereal, to then fries, then half a burger and some fries, and so on so forth. My support system was mainly my family. A lot of people at school made fun of me, saying I wanted attention and I even once got kicked in the lungs during  PE because it was hard for me to breath. There were a handful of people that actually cared and helped, same with teachers. All the teachers talked to me in some way to help cope with my disorder. That‚Äôs how I met my girlfriend. I was at lunch not eating and she came up and started talking out of nowhere, and we became close started dating. She found out about my anorexia when she came over and found out I didn‚Äôt eat, which led her to talk to my parents and then saying I had anorexia. She could have left but she didn‚Äôt. She said she fell in love with me due to personality and wanted to help me out in anyway shape or form. Back men with my condition, it was hard finding people like me that were men.
