I am currently not on any medications. There are certainly people and things in my life that contribute to my stress. Most prominently, conversations with my mother, work obligations, as well as general comments from peers. When I’m stressed, I usually cope by self soothing (i.e taking a bath, meditating, taking care of my animals), and I consider my support network to be a combination of a few good friends and my partner. The nausea has happened before when I’ve tried to re-feed, but it was not as intense as it is now."

Unfortunately, changing behaviors and tendencies with self awareness can come with a certain shame when examining the past.

It has helped me to accept the past more and move away from this shameful thinking when it is not constructive. Ultimately, dwelling on the past extensively does no good.

BPD,fqji3l7,t1_fqjec4d,1589410244.0,"Often, emotions and thoughts are heightened with the diagnosis of BPD. These feelings may be something that everyone can relate to, but the intensity may be more indicative of BPD.

For me, this experience is a bit different than normal nostalgia. Firstly, it’s usually attached to distress rather than positive emotions. Secondly, it not exactly that I am yearning for a time in the past or anything related to my childhood, it is that I am yearning for a safety/comfort. The symbol of that safety/comfort for me seems to be the concept of home. 

I’m sure all people experience this concept to a degree. We all want to be comforted when we are not feeling well and home is a pretty universal comfort symbol.

It absolutely helped me understand myself a little better as well so I am glad you posted! I find I sometimes stay in certain states longer than I should, or I skip to an alarm state with a trigger. 

Vagal tone will likely become the most important index for stress vulnerability as well as reactivity in persons with affective disorders. 

The Polyvagal Theory identifies a third nervous system response based on what we have learned in evolutionary science with the stress response. It basically states that our autonomic nervous system is interconnected with and sensitive to afferent influences (body to brain). 

In short, this theory can help us look beyond the effects of fight or flight and put social relationships into play when understanding trauma. This is due to the way the theory approaches the biology of safety/danger with the interplay of social experiences. This is pretty huge, in my opinion, as someone who struggles with PTSD and BPD. It is also suggested that there will be new approaches to healing that focus on strengthening the body’s system for regulating arousal.

I want to just reemphasize that OP seems to have great self-awareness. I like to think I am the same way with being self-aware, thanks to a lot of therapy. I feel like that awareness helps me to take accountability for my actions, but it also allows me to say sorry too much when others sometimes don’t. It is important in any relationship that both parties own up to their mistakes and apologize. Each person is responsible for their actions, not just one person, and blaming someone else for your actions is an absolute cheap shot. It doesn’t seem like this type of interaction is something that occurs for OP, and I’m sure that must be painful when you work hard yourself on taking accountability. This is a valid concern and I would consider opening a conversation about it with OP’s partner. 

In my experience, BPD can become the thing that is blamed when conflicts arise. That can be very frustrating because not all disagreements come from a “BPD place”. It can be quite invalidating of your emotions and it seems like it turns into a form of gaslighting for this post. I’m sorry you’re experiencing this, OP, but please know you’re not overreacting. Do not doubt your own sanity! Stand your ground on the issue of accountability and blame/gaslighting. Take some time to cool off and then maybe discuss your concerns calmly with your partner. Remember that you deserve to be heard regardless of your diagnosis, you’re so much more than that.

Patience and communication is key, I find. Establish your boundaries and plan of action for bad moments. I would cater these to specific actions/words so it is concrete.

At least in my own experience, sometimes a split can become so intense that I actually need my space to regulate using skills in order to communicate effectively. This would be a boundary I would discuss. 

In my experience, going through DBT and journaling made me a better partner as well. It made me more aware of myself and allowed for me to better track my tendencies. The skills I learned in DBT also made me a more functional person. Medication and therapy can be great tools to keep in mind.

BPD,fpad6ki,t3_gc8tbi,1588445714.0,"How compassionate of you to be doing this sort of thing for your sister! Truly makes my heart warm xx 

I’m sorry she is not doing the best right now, these are difficult times for everyone and especially those with mental health struggles. BPD is a difficult diagnosis to manage, so I’m so glad she has your support. My first piece of advice is to not count out medication. Especially since your sister suffers from both depression and BPD. It isn’t a perfect solution, but for some, it can be a very helpful tool for aiding in recovery. 

Besides medication, things that help me keep balanced are routine and writing. I find my mind runs off the most when I am just sitting in bed with no real direction to my day. So I have created structure to my routine that has been keeping me pretty sane during this quarantine (fingers crossed). So I make sure that within my routine, I have time in my to get all of my work/school obligations done and I also have a time for “me activities”. Two elements of “me time” I find most important are: letting energy out and treating the self. I would suggest your sister make sure that one activity a day allows her to release some some energy (example: exercise, meditation, interacting with pets). The TIIP skill is a great distress tolerance skill if just plain exercise isn’t cutting it. I would also suggest your sister pick one activity a day that makes her smile. I’ve been baking cookies, reading different books, practicing out my photography, so it can literally be anything. Engaging with this activity mindfully can be super relaxing and validating. Of course this doesn’t solve the problem outright, but I find when I force a balance of routine on myself, it helps to mediate some of my irregularities in mood. 

The second thing that helps me keep balanced is writing down my moods/thoughts to reflect on later. I keep a full DBT journal and report in it daily. It can be very helpful to track my emotions and check my own emotional intensity later on. It’s been a mechanism that has helped me become more aware of my tendencies.  

She could even write out in an entry with what she wants to say to her partner, but can’t. That could be a helpful way for her to voice her own emotions somewhere. I would probably do this in conjunction with another distress tolerance skill (self soothe, radical acceptance, ACCEPTS etc.), but that is just me. If you have any questions about skills, there are tons of online resources, or you could send me a PM! 

I hope this was helpful! Best of luck to your sister in the road to recovery. Sending you love xx"

BPD,fp9awo1,t3_gc0q3s,1588420773.0,"A huge issue for a lot of people struggling with BPD is a difficulty deciphering where others end and where we begin. Not literally, more so in an emotional sense and in what things we take on as “truth” internally. This can manifest itself in a sensitivity to criticism. If you’re looking for advice, I’d first examine if a critique is constructive or not. If it isn’t, then it isn’t really worth your time. I suggest trying to put up a “boundary bubble” and NOT take on this person’s actions or reactions as “the truth” of your experience. Just because another person feels it and expresses it, doesn’t mean that their perception of this is true for you. This can be hard to do, so using distress tolerance skills in combination can help. If it is constructive, check your own sensitivity level as well as the other person’s intentions. Use FAST to maintain a good relationship with the person, but also stand up for yourself. Listen more to what the other person says, but again remain a sort of “boundary bubble” since this person is not all knowing of your experience. Try not to allow the words to have an affect on your self worth, instead just inform you on how others see things. Best of luck, be well xx"

BPD,foz4c6g,t3_gadt7e,1588184466.0,"Try to connect and ground to your surrounds via use of five senses. Figure out which sense (sight, hearing, touch, fast, smell) grounds you the best by trying out various mindful activities. For example, I find that auditory and touch cues work best for me so I will play music and listen intently to the words/sounds, take a long shower with all my favorite soaps, or wrap myself up in a soft blanket and watch some television. It all depends on what works for you, so you may need to try out a bunch of activities. Sometimes a full distraction with complex behaviors (making a meal, watching television) is needed to help pull you back to reality. Hope this helps, be well xx"
BPD,foz34b7,t3_ga4ycb,1588183876.0,"Can totally relate to this feeling. When I was 13 (undiagnosed) I took off in the middle of the night to get on a train. Had no location in mind, just literally wanted to be anywhere that was away from where I was. 

Sometimes that feeling comes back and I want to run again like I did when I was younger. For me, it’s not so practical or safe to just up and move, so I usually create my own little oasis at home. 

Be well and hope you’re having a good day <3"
BPD,foz005y,t3_gadi3h,1588182307.0,"Try doing something for yourself each day to de-stress and release some of that excess energy. Some of my favorites are: exercise, meditation yoga, reading a book, showering with all my favorite soaps, fixing myself up in nice clothes for no reason, baking all different kinds of cookies... do anything your heart desires :) 

I find that releasing some of my energy and finding a way to have some solo relaxation time really helps me be calmer day to day."
BPD,foyyodf,t3_ga7sg4,1588181626.0,"A lot of the symptoms of BPD are things we can all relate to, it is just the magnitude and intensity that make them disordered. I think that is why you may say “but doesn’t everyone do that?”. I had the same thoughts after I found out, but intensity is an important factor with BPD. The relationship issue you’re talking about I don’t think is “main” to BPD, I would instead say it’s an instability in interpersonal relationships, but even that isn’t uniform across ALL people with BPD. There are nine main traits to the diagnosis, but plenty of variable combinations within the DSM. 

I am not a professional, so I cannot diagnose you and I won’t speak on the validity of a professional’s diagnosis, but I don’t think attending the suggested DBT course is a bad idea. First off, DBT has been proven to be a very effective therapy for those with BPD and it sounds like some of your symptoms do match up with the diagnosis. Second off, what’s the hurt? Half of the stuff I learned in DBT I think neurotypicals should read too! I get your concerns with being the only male, but I do think there is some valuable information to be learned in the course. At the end of the day, you’re seeing a therapist for a reason and this is the suggestion. It is your decision if going to the DBT course will be worthwhile attending. Best of luck xx"
BPD,foywerx,t3_gaagwb,1588180427.0,"First of all, kudos for being in therapy and taking an initiative to improve communication.

To me, this issue sounds like it is related to BPD. Splitting is a common coping defense mechanism of BPD and it can cause you to see things in only black/white terms. I think this type of thinking is related to what your describing when you say you act as if you don’t want to be wrong. This type of denial is typical of splitting thinking/behaviors. I would look up splitting if you want to understand more of the complexities, but it is a hallmark symptom of BPD and one that I have worked extensively on in therapy to manage. 

Taking accountability is important. I’m glad you’re recognizing it as such because sometimes that can be a hard step; I know it was for me. Taking accountability, however, has been huge in maintaining my relationships. I know that when I have adverse reactions due to my BPD, I need to take responsibility for them and attempt to explain my perspective calmly after the emotional intensity dies down. It’s almost feels like sometimes I have to humble myself to take accountability, but it’s worth it. The other people in your life aren’t going on this emotional rollercoaster with you, so communication is key as well. 

I think it is a good idea to tell the people important and close to you that it is okay to tell you when they’re upset by your actions. If you feel the frustration and anger coming on when they come to you, it is usually best to remove yourself politely from the situation and focus on your emotional intensity. I suggest looking at some distress tolerance skills to help you get through the crisis without exacerbating things and also help accept the reality of criticism. You can look up various distress tolerance skills, there are tons of online resources. Once emotions have calmed down, hopefully logic and reasoning will be able to kick in. This is the time to take accountability. Hopefully, you can look over the situation with perspective and reflect on what is true about what was said. At this point, you would then utilize the interpersonal effectiveness skills (DEAR MAN especially) in order to maintain the relationship with the person, to explain yourself mindfully and to listen to them speak. 

This all depends on circumstance, but the general outline of how I deal with splitting and taking accountability remains largely the same. 

I hope this is helpful to you, my PMs are open if you have any questions. Best of luck, taking accountability can be hard <3"

BPD,fouk0i6,t1_fotzp9y,1588085479.0,"Your therapist is not correct. I’m sorry, but I hate to see misinformation spread.

People can have BPD and “question themselves” or their actions. The contrary is ridiculous and may be a reality for some, but it isn’t a hallmark of this mental illness. I find this language quite divisive. Often times people with BPD do question themselves and can even regret things that happened. Look all over this subreddit! There are plenty of examples of that type of thinking taking place. I am actually diagnosed and I have an increased self-awareness that impacts my BPD. There may be nine traits total, but there are many combinations in the DSM and ways this illness can be expressed clinically. This impacts functioning/severity, as it does with many major mental illnesses. I hope you get a proper diagnosis soon xx"

ptsd,fornf3t,t3_g92cyo,1588015186.0,"I can relate to you, I feel like without my normal schedule I’ve experienced an uptick in flashbacks and dissociation. I find that mindfulness exercises which engage my five senses work well for me. I find these activities really engage my mind and my flashbacks tend to subside as a result. It could be something like taking a hot shower with your favorite soaps, doing a strenuous workout, eating/savoring some good food, watching a new movie that interests you, or a combination of those. I’ve found that I respond particularly well to auditory and touch cues, so I focus on those to ground me. Figure out what works for you and try out a few different activities. Best of luck xx"
ptsd,formhx7,t3_g969in,1588014732.0,"100% can relate. I know how scary this can be to realize, so just know you’re not alone. If I have a bad night, I often wake up sore in my arms and neck as a result of the weird positions and things I do in my sleep. Through therapy, I’ve figured out a lot of this relates back to my trauma. Weighted blankets seem to help me a decent amount to reduce movement. Be well xx"
BPD,forj4g5,t3_g95cww,1588013103.0,"I am sure this is different for others as it’s typically known as a coping defense mechanism of BPD, so keep in mind this is just my experience with splitting. Splitting has been something I’ve worked a lot on in therapy so at this point, I am aware of when I am splitting. This wasn’t always the case, but now sometimes I can even tell before I have a major split that I am feeling “splitty”. By “splitty” I mean I can tell my emotions are intensifying and my thinking process is becoming increasingly black/white. In these cases, I can usually then deescalate the situation and my emotions to minimize the chance of splitting. Sometimes I even just take time for me away from others until I can deescalate because I know I’m in this headspace. This has been pretty major for me in my therapy journey, so just know it CAN get better. However, sometimes that doesn’t happen. Sometimes I do split and even though I say I am “aware” that I am splitting, it doesn’t mean that I can just snap out of that mentality so easily. It’s a weird type of awareness during splitting (at least for me), that I can only really describe with an example. Splitting, for me, is like riding shotgun in a car with your split self at the wheel. You know what’s going on and where you’re headed, but you have little control. I sometimes feel internally desperate to make “everything better again” while I’m splitting, yet the emotions are so intense sometimes they override the reasoning. It can get so convoluted in my head that I even forget how I got upset in the first place, but the emotional side is still there driving the splitting. However, eventually my emotions do regulate and my reasoning is able to kick in more effectively to the point where I realize I just split and I realize the damage I just caused. This usually comes with a lot of crying followed by attempts to repair the relationship through taking accountability. It’s not that I “changed my mind”, it’s more-so that I realize that I had an inappropriate reaction in the moment. For me, this splitting is both tied to emotion and thinking processes. It’s largely in reaction to my fear of abandonment, and it often does affect my memories with that person. Through good communication and lots of therapy, I’ve been able to parse out a lot of the true from fake memories with people, but it is definitely a difficult aspect of splitting. 

I don’t have great advice on how to see this all coming, honestly. It took me time and DBT therapy to progress in my awareness with splitting. Maybe increasing mindfulness of emotional intensity or learning ways to regulate them more effectively could help? I’m not a professional, so don’t take my advice too seriously. However, communication has been key to maintaining relationships for me. I find that when people are on the same page as you, they tend to me more understanding and they may even make you more aware of your own tendencies."
BPD,forcf52,t3_g90vi1,1588009862.0,Hell yeah!!! Great job on the workout and I’m glad it’s making you feel happier too. Working out is great for my stress. Keep it up xx
BPD,foraejf,t3_g94i15,1588008891.0,"Grounding objects can come from anything in your environment. If the rocks aren’t working, ditch them and try something else :) 
What helps me to ground is interaction with my surroundings using the five senses. I would suggest figuring out which sense grounds you the most. Try out a bunch of grounding exercises with different senses to figure out what works best. For me, I know that it’s auditory and touch that help me ground best. So I’ll run my hands under hot/cold water or take a long shower with my favorite soaps while I blast some music. I hope this helps, best of luck xx"
BPD,fok3jfr,t3_g7gh86,1587834739.0,"I’m sorry that you’re struggling to relax, I struggle with restlessness myself sometimes. Besides what others have mentioned about reaching out for help and possibly receiving medication/therapy, I suggest looking into distress tolerance skills. I know these are uncertain times in terms of getting in touch with mental health professionals to receive treatment, but this is something you could do by yourself and it’s doesn’t require cannabis. I would suggest starting slowly with something like mindfulness or TIIP, especially since you mention the success you have with exercise. Don’t hesitate to PM if you have any questions as well. Be well xx"
BPD,fok1l1l,t3_g7tt1q,1587833669.0,"Proud of you for working out today! Sometimes it can be difficult to motivate yourself, but I always feel accomplished after a work out. I’ve been doing some HIIT training and yoga at home due to this outbreak so I can stay active. I’ve also enjoyed going on a few runs a week outside which has been nice to get out of my four walls a little bit. It’s been really refreshing to break up my day to get some of that energy out so I can sleep easier at night. I totally relate to that, so I hope you get some good Zzz’s tonight. After I finish a workout, I also feel good about myself for putting my energy into something positive. It’s a great feeling that can help me start the day off right. I’ve found I really rely on a routine to maintain stability and that exercise is a great distress tolerance skill for me. Be well xx"

BPD,fnml22j,t3_g2jhpg,1587073362.0,"A huge issue for a lot of people struggling with BPD is a difficulty deciphering where others end and where we begin. Not literally, more so in an emotional sense and in what things we take on as “truth” internally. This can manifest itself in a sensitivity to criticism. If you’re looking for advice, I’d first examine if a critique is constructive or not. If it isn’t, then it isn’t really worth your time. I suggest trying to put up a “boundary bubble” and NOT take on this person’s actions or reactions as “the truth” of your experience. Just because another person feels it and expresses it, doesn’t mean that their perception of this is true for you. This can be hard to do, so using distress tolerance skills in combination can help. If it is constructive, check your own sensitivity level as well as the other person’s intentions. Use FAST to maintain a good relationship with the person, but also stand up for yourself. Listen more to what the other person says, but again remain a sort of “boundary bubble” since this person is not all knowing of your experience. Try not to allow the words to have an affect on your self worth, instead just inform you on how others see things. Best of luck, be well xx"
BPD,fnmd2es,t3_g2msyw,1587069243.0,"Good decision 100% for my mental health. Being in school gives me a type of purpose and the distance allowed me to grow. I didn’t move to a different country, but I moved a distance for my schooling and absolutely don’t regret it. I’m sorry the situation the coronavirus has put you in. The pain of being in a traumatic and toxic home is difficult. I’d also mention that I think it worked for me because I am also a pretty independent person and I had a support network where I was headed. I had been through DBT therapy once and was going through it a second time, so I was already pretty in tune with my BPD. I wanted to make this situation work for myself and to be successful on my own, separate from the mess. I knew my tendencies, but I also had skills so I wasn’t flying in blind. Even still, my living situation isn’t perfect and I still experience struggles with my mental health, but the intensity is so different. 100% best decision, at least for me. Barring finances and public health don’t get in the way, I’d suggest getting out of your toxic environment to peruse something you enjoy academically. Best of luck xx"
