After so many years of wanting the Urban Decay Naked palette I finally bought it and now I feel like I can‚Äôt use it unless I have something important or formal to do. It took me years to get used to buying myself nice things since I grew up very poor and having to throw everything I own away every time we moved, which was on average 3 times a year. My aunt finally told me one day that I don‚Äôt live in that environment anymore. I can buy nice things if I want. It was liberating. I just bought a new Jeep because I wanted one so long and I am no longer going to settle because it‚Äôs cheap or I don‚Äôt need nice things."

CPTSD,fpgs63h,t3_gdavl2,1588608538.0,"Ugh I used to feel this in my bones. Do you have any mother type figure in your life? Maybe focus on them instead? I was raised by my aunt after my mom abandoned me, so it‚Äôs a bit easier for me nowadays. 

I‚Äôm so sorry you are feeling that way. I remember Mother‚Äôs Day was a day I used to dread so badly. My mom abandoned me a few days before Mother‚Äôs Day back in 2003 so it was such a raw day for me for years."
CPTSD,fpey6wl,t1_fpds593,1588557503.0,Totally agree! I made a post on this subreddit a few months ago about the scene in The Dark Knight Rises when Detective Blake does the monologue about losing your parents and the anger you feel all the time. The first time I saw that movie I started crying in the movie theater. It‚Äôs probably the scene that has explained my life the most accurately.
CPTSD,fpey0en,t1_fpdkgt1,1588557390.0,I honestly had the realization last night while watching Bob‚Äôs Burgers.

I don‚Äôt think the way I did then, but at that time I had not been diagnosed with OCD so I just was shocked that someone could just stop on their own free will!

CPTSD,fnae7oi,t3_g0ju1q,1586795949.0,"Sadly I was the opposite, but it‚Äôs interesting to see this. I was very bad in school because of all the stress of home life and then I was physically abused at home due to my grades. I even remember teachers not liking me in elementary school due to my behavior problems and poor academics. They had no idea I was being abused. I really figured I‚Äôd do nothing with my life until I finally had a good support system in high school with teachers and school counselors."
OCD,fmmpdqj,t3_fw0g5w,1586209545.0,Yes! Especially for about a week after I first learned my diagnosis. I was terrified and confused and wondering what all was my OCD and what was really me. I still obsess over it but not as severe.

CPTSD,fmgh2fc,t1_fmewdbp,1586048896.0,"I completely understand. When I got the OCD diagnosis I was quite surprised. I was originally diagnosed with GAD with obsessive thoughts until I told her I also skin pick and then she changed it to OCD/GAD. I was sent to a trauma specialist and she‚Äôs the one who diagnosed me with CPTSD. I think understanding OCD is a lot more difficult for me. I suffer from intrusive thoughts and picking, which both stemmed from my trauma. Medication helps with all three of my conditions."
CPTSD,fmewfrp,t3_fuo8e8,1586015008.0,Yes! But honestly for me I get really angry. I honestly have yelled out of anger maybe 5 times in my entire life. I don‚Äôt get angry. But if I am being ignored or trying to get someone‚Äôs attention and they are ignoring me I get so furious it‚Äôs almost difficult to control. I never like to be the center of attention but the rare moments I need the attention of others and I don‚Äôt get it I get so mad.
CPTSD,fmevxne,t3_fuv3ht,1586014700.0,"Yes! But alongside CPTSD I do have OCD/ GAD, and what I‚Äôve learned is that‚Äôs more of an OCD trait but I may be wrong."

OCD,fl6410s,t3_fmsxff,1584853735.0,Same. I think it‚Äôs just because this is a huge deal it‚Äôs rational to be worried but with our OCD it just makes it worse.

I know my therapist has said I may have BPD and I am seriously thinking that‚Äôs an accurate diagnosis, but I know for sure CPTSD is accurate too considering my childhood trauma.

My therapist even recommended I leave my job during our last visit and recommended I find a ‚Äúfun, low stress‚Äù job once I move. It may be a hint that I‚Äôm a bit mentally/emotionally fragile right now. Since my father died in September (just one adult that caused me trauma) I‚Äôve been really off.
