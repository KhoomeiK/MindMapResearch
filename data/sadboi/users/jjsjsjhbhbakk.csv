SuicideWatch,fpcxpa0,t3_gc5dro,1588515345.0,"We all make fucking terrible mistakes. Maybe we lose someone's trust or have a lifelong injury. We all have to live with our choices and be very careful. I had a friend once who fucked up his grade, got into an extremely fucked up abusive relationship and lost sight in one eye. He attempted suicide by hanging, but didn't break his neck and his sister saved him. I was talking to him pre covid and when I asked him how he was holding up, he said that he immediately regretted his decision. When he dropped, he said he immediately regretted his decision. When his sister came, he knew people did care about him and when he was at the hospital, he knew he wasn't alone. If you have a reset button, the choices you make are invaluable. If you decide to die and in those few seconds, minutes or hours afterwards you decide that you regret your decision, its no longer in your control. Sure, you could just die and end your pain, but what if you realise that the pain is worth it. That friend told me that the moment he regretted it was the saddest he'd been in his life."

If you have the drive and you have a good reason to pursue this career, put everything into it. Lots of great writers, film directors and artists didn't get recognition starting out. Van Gogh dealt with people shitting on his art his entire life. You will find an audience, people who like your work."
