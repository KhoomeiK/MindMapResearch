Nepal,flqj0wv,t1_flqgto2,1585396697.0,"You know how it is with the quantities, its always the game of guess. So forgive me for not being spot on. For a kilogram of raw mangoes, heres my take:
1. Cut your mangoes into smaller size. (8 pieces from a normal sized mango).
2. Dry them in direct sunlight. (make sure dont overdry them, keep half of the moisture preserved)
3. Take 30g of fennel and 15g of fenugreek seeds. Lightly toast them in a pan until you smell the aroma coming out of it and coarsely grind them.
4. Take a bowl and add those dried bad boys along with the grinded fenugreek and fennel. Also add 15g of turmeric, 15g of red chilly powder, 15g of onion seeds( you can use mustard seeds as well, I personally find onion seed better).
5. Add salt more than you think you may need. You dont want your pickle to be undersalted. Also salt speeds up the fermentation process. 
6. Add 100g of pure mustard oil. Mix it nicely and there you have it.
6. Store it in an airtight glass jar in a dry environment. Make sure to invert the jar every once in a day for atleast a week. Add oil if you think you need to.
Now all you gotta do is wait for a month. The longer you wait the better it tastes."

There are not enough testing kits available and just assuming no one has the virus is just nonsense. The lockdown is great move and only move available for us. So lets not be misinformed.
Coronavirus,fl5u957,t1_fl5c3oq,1584845858.0,Yeah the lockdown is great move but I can assure you apart from that the politician (or Prime Minister should I say) in the picture that you're seeing is as corrupt as any other corrupt person.
