SuicideWatch,fqxqfdh,t3_glidbe,1589736284.0,"Ngl, yes probably. And from an outsider like me, the most unhelpful thing I could say would be "" Everything's gonna be alright as long as you move on."" But I think I can say the following because I have my own inner demons that I'm still dealing with, and i get that some problems in life can be really hard to cope with, so here goes: Naturally everybody hopes to lead a happy, carefree life, and when life starts to deviate from this dream we have, as it tends to sometimes, all of us would feel disheartened and sad. Having no friends and family to count on sucks, personally the only people I have in my social circle are my acquaintances. So don't for a minute feel bad about forgiving him when he comes back to you to say sorry. But what i want to say is that i feel he is manipulating you. To be honest, I have no right to judge, and I'm only making this assumption based on what you have said, but if this is true I will have no regrets in saying it. Yes, you may have wasted your time on this guy, yet as cliche as it sounds, isn't it better to get out of it now and be away from all this unhappiness rather than stay on? Sure, coming from me, it may be hypocritical as I have some problems I have difficulty moving away from, but I'm trying. I would rather try to be my best self and let some sunlight into my life than continue down this darker and more dreary road. 

Forgive me for what I am about to say next, it may be hurtful, but I think it is important. You said you stayed with him because he is the only person in your life to show you concern. Everybody needs to be loved by others, I am sure that all of us are psychologically and socially inclined to that. But i think what is even more important is that we are capable of loving ourselves, to be able to make the right decisions so that we select the right choices for ourselves, no matter how hard it may seem. And I think you thinking that this time together was a waste is really important, because it seems to me like you're coming to the conclusion that will be the best for yourself. Since I can't foresee the future for you, I cant say that this story is going to have a happy ending, even though I hope it does, but at the very least I hope that, if you do let go of this relationship, you can see it as a valuable lesson, rather than a waste of your time. Easier said than done, I agree, but I believe that the past, being a memory, can't hurt us, not unless we let it. 

I won't say anymore, because this sounds long enough. I wish you all the best in your journey ahead, if you ever need to talk to someone, you could drop me a message :)"

therapy,ffvsfso,t3_evhfva,1580271941.0,"Do you have anything that you really really want to achieve? Perhaps you could take some time to think about it, to try and find some sort of purpose that will give you the motivation. For example, my cousin really wanted to have a high income, so she decided to invest her time in studying really hard and developing the skills necessary to be ""successful"" in the future, not because she liked it, but because she knew she would like what she could achieve down the road, and she's doing pretty well now, so you might want to do a bit of reflection on your passions, and see if you can tie that to your studies. 

I'm not so sure what I can advise you on for your fear of failing. I have problems with this myself too. But I read a book lately and it inspired me. One of the most powerful quotes said ""Being a winner means being unafraid of losing. "" Your chem tutor said its about practice, and I think part of the practice is in your real life tests that are graded. It probably is painful if yoy do badly now, but at the end, if you can do well in your final exam, wouldn't that be really great? :D

So yeah, if you could think about a powerful passion you have and focus on the journey that could lead you to a beautiful destination, it might just help."

However, since you say you like your current therapist, it seems like a good idea to continue. 

If you feel anxious or unconfident talking about it in person, you could try writing it down or recording yourself talking about it then showing it to your therapist. I believe baby steps are very important at the beginning, every little bit of progress definitely counts for something.

therapy,fcxqkoc,t3_ejgg2v,1578069086.0,"What you're going through can't be easy, and it sounds like it may be frustrating to tackle the issue at its core, but I believe you can do it. This has happened to a close friend of mine a couple of years back, so I think I can imagine what it's like. 

First, I would like you to consider the possibility that what they say is not entirely false, that you are intelligent. While it seems to me that they overly emphasize it, the fact that you have good grades at university level, is an impressive achievement, ""even"" if you did work hard for it. I believe that to excel in anything, you need a minimum amount of talent before your effort can carry you. You may say that grades are not a necessary indicator of intelligence and that is true, so let's say you have ""academic intelligence"", which is also a very good trait.  Believing in yourself and your intellect, while not necessarily being something that can solve the problem fully, can help lessen the pressure you are facing right now. 

Second, your classmates may say this due to envy. This is a wild speculation on my part because I don't know them personally, but I'd say that it is a possibility. There may be closet muggers among them who say this because they can't achieve the same grades as you and refuse to accept that you are more academically inclined. If this is the case, and I hope not, then unfortunately you probably have to accept it, since you won't be able to change their attitudes. The best I can say is to keep believing in yourself and you have the potential to do it. A simple ""Others think I'm smart, so why not I challenge myself where possible to see if that's true?""

Last, perhaps you could try asking your classmates if they want to study together. I believe there are two benefits to this: Your classmates will understand that there are areas which you are not as strong in, which require improvement and it will help foster your bonds as you do something meaningful together. Can't hurt to try, right? 

I hope that I was able to help you, even if just a little. All the best with your future interactions with your classmates. :)"

You're also right when you say I don't know you, but if you ever do feel comfortable, you could drop me a message to chat about our lives.

SuicideWatch,fc0l2v4,t3_efi486,1577293442.0,"I'm sorry that you had to go through what you did with your best friend and mom. It can't be easy and if I were in your situation, I would feel the same way. However, as much as you may love your best friend and mom, they don't own or control you, and their thoughts certainly do not dictate their actions. Your best friend may have been unsympathetic and shown no understanding, but you don't necessarily have to let her words get to you, it's the same with your mother. Yes, they do hurt, but life has infinite possibilities. Think about the times when you were happy, life has so much good to offer, don't let the words of your mother affect you to the point where you deny yourselves these opportunities to happiness. 

Please, talk to your mom, open up to her and share what's plaguing you. Be honest about how you're feeling, it will be hard, but please believe that your mother will help you if you first help yourself. Tell her that it hurts when she pretends that everything is ok and you want her to help. By sharing with her, you are giving her more reasons to understand and more opportunities to connect with you and make you feel better. Hope this helps. :)"
SuicideWatch,fc0jnsl,t3_efibc7,1577292329.0,"Hello there, it seems like you're going through a difficult time and my heart goes out to you. You say you are a complete failure and have not moved past where you were when you got out of high school. My question here is: Could you be a little too overly critical about this? I do not wish to downplay your problems and tell you to forget about it, because everyone's issues are very real and should be managed carefully so as to allow it to be better understood. 

Comparison is very common nowadays, we compare with everyone. Strangers, peers, our past selves. However, I think expectations have become increasingly high and a lot of us want so much from ourselves that we are quick to blame ourselves. I know it's really cliche to say ""Count your blessings"", but it can be really useful to do that sometimes, just to remember that we are more fortunate than we realize, and we should cherish what we have been given to the best of our ability. I would like to try and invite you to think of something good that has happened because of you, it can be anything really. Even if you made someone happy, that counts as a success, since it developed your relationship with said person. I'm sure there's something good that you have done that is worth remembering. 

In essence, I'd like to sum this up with a quote by Vincent Van Gogh: If you hear a voice within you that says you cannot paint, then by all means paint and that voice will be silenced. If you feel like a failure, then please go ahead and try to do something you've always wanted to do that you've considered an achievement. It really doesn't matter how well you do it, for by trying, you've proven yourself wrong that you're a good for nothing. So I beg you to consider taking a first step towards something new. You are not worthless, and are not a huge waste of space. Hope this helps, and happy birthday in advance. :)"

I don't want to drag religion too much into this but in Buddhist teachings, it is said that when giving back to our parents, we must ""pour water into the cup until it overflows"". In whatever we achieve, we must always give back more to our parents, and even then we will never truly able to repay them back for all the love that they have given us. Your parents seem very, if not over, understanding about your elder brother not willing to support them, which while good hearted, is likely to cause them trouble with finances in the future. I get that you are a fillial person and I respect you for that and it must be very frustrating for you to have to deal with your brothers nonsense. Unfortunately, some people are just selfish. I believe that sometimes you have to be more insistent with people like these, when their actions do hurt people. If he won't listen when you ask him about it, then speak up and be fully honest with him about how you really don't like it and how you think he should stop being a dick.

Even if you have done awful things that make you feel really guilty, every day is a brand new opportunity for you to do good, to make things right. The only thing that limits you, as Martin Buber so succinctly puts it, is yourself. Only you can determine if you are worthy enough, to deserve to live, to have the right to go around and try to put a smile on others face to better their lives, even if just for a moment. And here's my question for you: Why shouldn't you have that right? Why shouldn't you believe that you can do good, perhaps even more than what you've done wrong?

SuicideWatch,fbqg7h6,t1_fbqed2p,1577031384.0,"Ngl, I think you're a really selfless person. It's a pleasure to be able to converse with you. You say that making others happy makes you feel like that's all you're good for, but not everybody is good at making others happy. Many people just care about themselves, so someone like you is a treasure to come by. Besides, you aren't obliged to have to constantly examine your self worth, instead of asking ""What am I good at?"", perhaps you could try asking ""How could I do more good, both for myself and my family/friends?"" :)"
therapy,fbqe7mn,t3_ee6dgn,1577030777.0,"You don't strike me as insensitive or annoying. I think you wanting to know more details about your condition is natural and healthy, since an understanding of it will give you a chance to improve your mental health. Having gone to therapy and having swapped between a few therapists, I am convinced that they do try their best to provide a non judgemental environment for you to talk to them and have a deep knowledge about various issues that will enable them to help you. You mentioned that you cant help thinking like you're pushing for a certain disorder when you talk about disorders but in all honesty, I don't think you intentionally are pushing for it. In the above post, you come across as someone who is concerned about your own mental well-being and just want to figure it out, you're not trying to generate pity for yourself so I believe in you. If you do go see a therapist, keep in mind that they are there to help you and be for you, and with their experience they are likely to be able to recognise cues from you even if you do not yourself. I strongly believe that just talking to your therapist alone about this will be massively beneficial. As with regards to your mom putting the scheduling off, you couls consider online therapy as opposed to person to person therapy, it's more convenient and easier to facilitate. Hope this helps, I'm here if you need me. :)"

I believe we have various purposes in life, to live our best lives for ourselves and achieve the things we want, be a good friend/family member to those around us, and bringing hope to others in general. While life may seem fake now, you said that you had  6 months where you were happy. Could I know what happened during this period of time? Do you have any passions/hobbies that might be worth pursuing? You don't have to constantly put others before yourself, it's perfectly alright to try and find stuff that will make you happy."

therapy,fbq60st,t3_edydo0,1577028640.0,"Hello. My two cents worth are: A good conversation topic isn't the only thing thats needed in a meaningful relationship. More importantly, both need to respect and trust each other. It could go a long way if you tried to do small, but nice things for people. Eg messaging someone you know if he/she had a really busy day to ask how he/she was feeling. You could also try lending a listening ear to others, think of it as a meaningful opportunity for you to help others if they require it. It may seem hard, but if you take small baby steps, I'm confident you will be able to make progress. :)"

I would like to suggest you first try to interact more with the cousins that do like you, and find out more details about the other 5, etc their specific likes, personality, and use this to try and build a relationship with them if possible. You don't have to feel frustrated about your social anxiety, I believe that will not stop you from building healthy relationships as long as you put effort into it. You don't necessarily have to initiate conversations with them, if you could do nice things for them from time to time, or send them the occasional text msg to ask how their day was, they will be more likely to treat you as their own."
SuicideWatch,fbkbq8j,t3_edrmxw,1576947866.0,"Hi, I can relate to what you're saying. I used to really like Winx Club a few years back and when it was said that the series was over I was really upset. Having grown up watching it so much, I felt really connected to the characters and I really enjoyed the plots and vibes of the series. Having said that, while some shows are great, the series finale is inevitable and we should keep in mind that although such shows will end, the memories they can give us will last much much longer. You could try other genres of shows and see if you take a liking to any of them. Life can be so much more than our favourite TV show, if you are willing to try and explore a little bit more. Perhaps instead of feeling upset that My Little Pony is over, you could reflect on the pleasure the show gave you throughout these 7 years. Hope this helps. :)"

relationship_advice,fbk8hg2,t3_edrt51,1576946400.0,"Considering a threesome could be an option, but ultimately you want to ask yourself if you feel comfortable enough to do it. There are some things that aren't just ""give and take"". You have to set the boundaries and know when your partner is crossing your limits. If you dislike the idea then firmly say no, it's perfectly acceptable since your relationship is between the two of you. If she resents you for saying no, it might imply that she does not consider your feelings/ is making excuses for her own personal desires, and that might not be the best fit for you. Hope this helps."

While it's unfortunate that life appears a struggle to you, it's really brave of you to continue to strive forward and not completely give up. If nothing else, take courage in the fact that you are sensible and know how to manage  the pain, it's definitely not something that everybody is able to do. While I do hope that life would not appear so meaningless to you, I can't magically change that. However, I would encourage you to try and think about what you are really passionate about and work towards that, I believe many people are interested in something, just that they are not aware of it.

If he suddenly chooses to ignore you and treat you as if you are invisible, then it's his problem for not being willing to invest effort into your friendship. Even if he doesn't like something that you did, he owes it to you to explain what he doesn't like. What he's doing right now seems like a jerky move, and it's totally on him. Even though it makes you feel sad rn, it may actually be a good thing as it lets you see this different side of him. Better to find out now than later down the road. Cheer up! It's his loss if h3 continues to act like this. Hope you won't let the aloof behaviour of this dude affect your mood too much. :)"
family,fbjieiv,t3_edmhbg,1576934113.0,"Based on what you said about your mom having to work two full time jobs financially and your dad  being domestically abusive, I think it's justifiable that you feel this way towards your dad. Although there is strain in your relationship, it definitely is not unsalvageable. I'd like to suggest that you try and reach out to him more in the near future lest he becomes completely estranged from you. As you said, you love your dad and you do worry about him, so perhaps you could try and focus on these more positive feelings to try and repair your relationship with him? At the end of the day, I believe the both of you just want to be happy and at peace with each other, just because he does not initiate convos now does not necessarily mean he does not care. While family can drive us crazy, they are all we have, like it or not, so taking a first step to put your love for him before your anger and  talking to him and sorting out your problems might be a good idea. All the best! :)"
dating_advice,fbgphyh,t3_edb4ix,1576855557.0,"Hello, hope you're having a good day! I think it's really sweet that you two have decided to spend more time with each other, and it's even nicer that you want to make the effort to support him. Since you mentioned that his ex and kids stay near to his place, i would assume that he has interactions frequently with at least his kids, if not with his ex as well. Your relationship with him may arouse jealousy within his ex and his kids may not be too thrilled about their dad dating another woman who is not their mom. This seems somewhat unlikely, but I think it's better to be safe than sorry, should this happen and he feels somewhat pressurised by his ex and kids, it may be a good idea to take the relationship slowly. From what you said,he's really into you, so taking it slow wouldn't mean anything bad, just that you would be giving him time to figure out how to convince his kids he still loves them etc as well as show him that you genuinely want the best for him. I would also assume that he would have some degree of custody over the children and spend time with them. Should you interact with them, I would like to suggest you try to be as genuine as possible. Even if you are not fond of them and he can see it,as long as you are polite and friendly, i believe he would much prefer this side of you as compared to a two faced one. By doing so, he knows you would accept everything he has to bring to your life. 
Ok, i think I've said a lil too much here but I'd just like to end on one note. I believe everyone has the right to find their SO and be happy so no matter what happens, as long as you continue to follow your dreams of being with this man that you like, I wish you the best. :)"
dating_advice,fbgma8u,t3_edao8g,1576853292.0,"Hello,hope you're having a good day! I'm in a relationship rn and it's going pretty chill, so don't stress out too much just yet bcos its actually not as bad as you may think it is. :) While you should be committed to your relationship, you dont have to treat it as though your life depends on it. So many people will come and go,whose to say you have to get engaged to your first boyfriend? I view my relationship as more of a getting to know her better kinda phase, where we try doing stuff together and see if it's like compatible. Even if it falls apart in future, we still have had some pretty good times! 
For what you say about feeling guilty about having three boys like you at the same time, i think i can understand where thats coming from, but I'd like to suggest that you take it a little more casually. First of all, if so many boys like you at the same time, it must mean you're pretty awesome right? So you should feel more confident in yourself. Why be guilty and not make any meaningful relationship progress with any of them when you can be more confident and get to know them all a lil bit better before you decide? Yes this is over, but you can apply this to any of your future relationships. 
Regarding your stress over whether you see them suitable as long term partners, my thoughts are that you want it to last because you dont want to go through the whole process of finding a new SO after one didnt work out. (Pls correct me if im wrong) While it certainly would be nice to meet the one, I doubt many ppl do meet their ideal partner at the first relationship, if they even do at all. Instead of looking at dating with the idea of marriage, maybe you could look at dating as getting to know someone much better, with the chance that you two could be close frens even if it doesnt work out? 
I know what I said is cringey and corny, but I sincerely hope you will be able to not feel stressed about dating and I wish you all the best in your college life. :)"
family,fbgkv78,t3_ed9use,1576852249.0,"Hi there! First of all, I'd like to say that you do noy strike me as being whiny. I think you have handed this situation very admirably and you have shown a high level of maturity by displaying a willingness to help out despite the favouritism that your mother shows to your sister. I get that being valued by someone is one of the best feelings ever, and that you are likely resentful that your mom likes your sister more for no reason that you can think of. Tbh i really really wouldn't like it to if i were in your shoes. However, if I'm being honest, I can't say your mother is wrong for having a favourite. In one way or another, we all have a bias and we will inevitably pick something/someone we like more than the other, just based on our own choices. I'm not trying to give some politically correct answer here, but what I'm trying to say is that perhaps it might be best if you tried not to focus on this favouritism too much. I know it is a lot easier said than done, but if you manage to do so, you will make life so much better for yourself. Families can be hell, I admit, but they're here with us for our entire life, so like it or not we have to interact and help them throughout. If you cant get across to your sis right now to help out more, maybe wait a few more years when shes more mature. I believe that one day, you won't be mindful of this favoritism your mom shows your sis and you wont be the only one pulling your weight around in this family. I hope I've been able to make you feel a little better, as I said in the intro, you seem like the OG. :)"
therapy,fbgjn9c,t3_ed9rvv,1576851320.0,"Hello, i read your post and can somewhat relate myself. I started therapy at the beginning of this year for getting angry over really trivial matters like you would not believe and at first i doubted the therapist would care. However, she turned out to be really nice and she would slowly help be deconstruct my anger issues and find ways to get around it. 
Your experience with the boy you liked sounds really unfortunate :( That sort of actions are really crummy and while it may sound unbelievable to some, can be really devastating(especially with such malicious intent.) Please dont start to doubt yourself just because you think others will doubt you/because of what others around you say. Perhaps you could try giving therapy a chance and perhaps your therapist might just click with you and help you out. I know this is really really corny but I sincerely believe that there are good people out there who will be more than happy to help. Even if they don't, don't start to question yourself or lose faith. Only you understand what you're going through and only you can help yourselg become happy again. 
All the best to finding a therapist that you can connect with and hope you can recover from this experience! :)"
