Medford,fiqrse6,t1_fiqqhst,1582650587.0,"Then I suppose we must agree to disagree on New China. For me, it was about a 6, and we got about 9 entrees altogether to try. Silver Dragon's Hunan Beef was actually quite good, but everything else there was terrible or well below average. Speaking of Silver Dragon, though, I actually love a specific sushi roll at the place right across the street. The Oregon Roll at New Sakura Restaurant is excellent. Never been to Lings in White City, but I will give it a shot sometime.

I will try the super burrito at La Burrita soon here, since it is so close to my house. I know we have a large Hispanic population here, so I fully understand the irony, but we lived in Grants Pass for 5 years before this and literally found no good Mexican food. Few places are truly horrible, but it seems like the valley is plagued with slightly above average to mediocre Mexican and Chinese restaurants. The Thai food here, however, is quite good for some reason.

On another note, I really miss Millie's Sandwich Shop, Dassh Bakery and Circle J Cafe in Grants Pass. I have had Buttercloud recommended to me multiple times, so I went there on 3 different occasions. I was impressed with the entrees, but they were a bit too expensive, especially for the portion sizes. I have not tried many sandwich shops yet, but I am not sure what can match Millie's that is in Medford yet. I am looking for a good burger here as well.
