MovieDetails,fr1wfv1,t3_gm3dky,1589827076.0,"Interesting.  Very interesting. That could definitely be one POV.  But he is eating a unicorn head...there’s an implied writer plot twist.  Hitler was chronicled as being heavily into magic and mysticism marching through the streets presenting himself as a god.  Could it be said then that the writers were showing us a deeper and expanded POV.  The presumption that such a personality would have such great disdain for a rare mythical creation as a unicorn that if it existed and could be found he would find it and merely eat it ... with a child to flex his power? Not even desiring to find out what further powers it possessed or worse yet, found out and simply killed it exalting himself as the deity he thinks he is and now tries to corrupt innocence with innocence? Unicorn hunting. IMHO it appears on some level this character development presented a hatred and disregard for innocence and sensually reveled in its death.  Feasting on it.  Kids cut to the chase. Possibly this kid was seeing how abhorrent Hitlers behaviors were but how he believed he might be destined in some way to become part of that life?"

She got a better gig after moving in so we weren’t coworkers after awhile which gave us breathing room.  After her new job ended (temp job) she was basically home during the end of her pregnancy, no problems there.  She paid her bills.  After the baby, friends and fam came to visit; her mom moved in without notice.  Yeah.  Roomie started a daycare while I was at work no asking discussing nada.  She got loud, rude, nasty when I asked about it.  Yeah.  Talked to my fam, here’s what we did. I moved all my furniture into storage which meant we both only had bedroom furniture.  No furniture? Daycare moms were not having it, daycare stopped one child at a time.  Me and her mom had a talk, mom was not happy with the story she told me vs the story she told her as to why my roomie didn’t have her own place.  Mom left, mad.  Last, my lease ended, I did not renew.  Now roomie had an almost empty place and had to put her name on the lease and buy furniture plus rent went up.  I left.

Many of them have cheated or been cheated on and just moved on but still together.  Different era during the 1930s and 1940s.  I have age 75+ parents of friends who have said this.  One which comes to mind was military, cheated on his wife so many times.  They had five kids.  Finally, he retired and decided to stop.  His wife developed dementia, he took care of her until she died.  Many days a few of us in the neighborhood would go over and help out and he would cry and tell us how he thought he would have time to change his cheating ways and make it up to her and give her anything she wanted in retirement and now here she was dying.  She never said a word about his cheating, everyone loved her personality and now I know I had no idea what she was really going through.

Waiting like a serpent until your justified bewilderment and heartbreak at the diabolical callousness causes you NOT to say the wrong thing, but to simply misstate a minute point out of shock which does not change what they did.  

You:  You f*cked someone in our bed!  
Them:  I did not.  I have never f*cked anyone in our bed.  You know I love you.

Catch:  they stated it exactly.  They know who they *f*cked and don’t consider them just “anyone” or “someone”.  Then comes the sick definition of what they consider “f*cked”.  The lies.  I won’t go there.  You found the evidence and the statement they made is what they will stand on.  Knowing you are fair and kind towards them to a fault they strike at that exact moment with pettiness, throw it up in the air and delightfully watch you try to adjust the misstatement being very careful in not accepting any adjustment of the misstatement and blowing it further and further and further away from themselves until you have exhausted defending yourself and what they did now appears somehow innocuous.  

They have their own language.  

I have a good friend who got so desperate she pretended to become ignorant.  Air headed almost.  So air headed that it was painful to watch as if she had a concussion.  Her husband got lax and thought he was a genius, he had worn her down, king of all he touched.  She waited and waited.  Stopped complaining, stopped noticing.  Just stopped.  One day she was at a meeting and she said her instincts told her to go home.  Her coworker had driven her so she asked if she would take her home real quick.  They got home and guess who was in the bed f*cking very loudly? And yes, they were “f*cking”.  She stayed quiet and so did the coworker whose jaw dropped to the floor.  My friend is a hoot, afterwards she said she asked the coworker, was that my bed?  She said yes.  We’re they f*cking? She said, definitely.  My friend said, thought so."
