Advice,fq9if1s,t3_gh9qrq,1589199183.0,"YOU are a great friend! I've always said people that get up on stage on ""(your country)'s got talent"" and sound like a fish in the hot summer sun, must not have any GOOD friends. You are a great friend!

Tell your friend you want to see them succeed. Tell your friend the music business is cutthroat {at best}, and every little advantage gets him/her closer to that concrete goal. Find examples of other very famous people that take singing lessons - there are a lot - and tell your friend you will go with to the lessons for morale support. 

I never had good friends like you. Nobody told me I sounded like a peacock getting strangled until I saw a recording of me singing ""Friends in low places"" at my buddy's graduation. I was devastated when I heard it. I thought I nailed it! All I nailed was more nails in the singing coffin. Had I friends like you, it would have saved me the embarrassment I harbored for the next 15 years. And I never sang publicly again. 

Be that friend that tells the person you care about you are not trying to be mean, you are trying to be supportive and helpful. Even if it hurts them at first, you will save them potentially years of humiliation, like I faced, because I didn't have a friend good enough to tell me a couldn't hold a note with a bushel basket. 

You are an amazing friend for caring enough to reach out for advice. Your friend will thank you in the end.

Since I don't have any friends, Reddit is just about my only communicative outreach option; which doesn't help at all when people enjoy trolling the mentally depleted and weak people such as myself. 

I have no coping skills. I know that sounds like rubbish but it's true. I have been a workaholic all my life, and devoted most of my life to furthering my career, moving up in the company, developing myself to be more marketable within the company, finding new opportunities, etc. Hindsight tells me I am the cause of my situation, but with all my years of going to college, continuous education, blah blah blah, I don't even know how to make friends. 

I have been a social outcast my entire life, so friends have come and gone once they got what they wanted from me, or found out I was a mental hot mess and didn't want the hassle of having me for a friend. 

One of the things that started my downward spiral was my company screwed me over. Not illegally or anything where I could do something about it, just internal politics and they needed a scapegoat. That started the depression train going off the tracks because work was everything to me. Being punished for something I didn't even do was a mental mind-f*ck. Then my estranged dad contacted me and wanted to ""rekindle a relationship"" after being gone for 30 years. Then I lost my daughter in a divorce, then I had a mild stroke, then I got diagnosed with Lupus... And then shit really fell apart. 

Anyways, life sucks right now no matter how I look at it and I am searching for anything to get back on my feet again. Any time I can get valuable advice such as what you offered, I consider it a win. 

Thank you for your time and for having the compassion to help instead of mock a grown man who is lost in a sea of pain and confusion. I really appreciate your help.

I am no1speshal to anyone. You are describing symptoms I have. May I ask what your disorder/disease(es) are called?

I know that putting a name with the feelings helped me out a lot. Although I wasn't happy to be diagnosed with Lupus and fibromyalgia, and all the other stuff I have, it helped communicate and justify my pain and anguish to others. And they stopped mocking me. Even my wife treated me like a whiny bitch until I got the diagnosis. Now she at least doesn't make fun of me. 

Please don't end yourself. Meet people like you, like you are doing right now. You will find more empathy and compassion over the internet, and you may find out more about yourself in the process.

I had to give my ex $144,000, a house with all it's contents, a new car, and I lost all contact with my daughter.

I was also homeless and unemployed by the age of 15 and that made a lot of things worse for me. 

I didn't know it was NOT normal until I was about 16. That's when I moved away. I lived in a primarily African American neighborhood, with a few Latinos. I was the only white kid, and a goofy looking ginger at that. I got my ass kicked just because people were bored. They called me Spot, mostly because that was a long time ago and people weren't as nice as they are now. 

It made me meaner than a burnt snake in my 20's and 30's, and kept me alive this long. I started working out and devoting my time to learning instead of revenge. I got over the 'being mean to people' in my late 30's but I carried a heavy grudge and was very rude to ask types of people because of all that until my education taught me all people aren't like that. Some have compassion, empathy, appreciation, and really do care.

I just got diagnosed with Lupus, because I guess being bipolar, manic depressive, borderline personality disorder, and chronic pain from bulging and ruptured discs, and degenerative disc disease was not enough. 

I want to die. More than anything else in the world.

Nobody cares. I have no friends. My wife doesn't like to talk to me because ""I'm always such a downer"" and she can't help - even though she doesn't even try. She won't even hold me and tell me it will be okay. I'm financially destitute, destroyed, and have no hope of improvement. I have completely lost my will to live because the pain is neverending. 

My wife is afraid that I'll commit suicide because if I do that, she won't get the insurance money. That's all I am to her. Money. Now that I'm not making any, it is clear as day I'm nothing to her but a constant nuisance. 

I just want to die. That's all. I don't care if it hurts. It can't be worse than the pain I already feel consumed by on a constant level.

To be honest, I'm waiting on myself to finally pull the trigger. It's the only way I will ever stop the pain. I've already done it in my mind. I don't have friends who will miss me.  It's getting sooner and sooner every day to click, click, boom for me."

SuicideWatch,fg37637,t1_fg1wqo7,1580472998.0,"What happened 4 years ago to cause this trauma?  And yes, I know exactly what you mean. They're like Gremlins and somebody pushed them in the pool! They're everywhere!

I'm going to tell a story that will be confusing but I think it's relevant. I have 45 years of experience being in your shoes. 

When my Grandpa was still alive, he used to try and help me through times like these. To be honest, I thought he was either crazy high, or just a complete whack job because he use to have a saying for everything. He was born in 1914 and lived through a lot of shit during the depression.  I was a goofy psychotic kid that was too lost in himself to try and make sense of those sayings so I usually ignored them, like most kids do. Most of them didn't make any sense to me anyways because I was lost in the static of my own mind. When he expired in 1999, every one of those phrases he told me came rushing back into my mind. They have helped me immensely since then. I want to share them with you to see if they help you. 

The one he used to say most was, ""When you're laying flat on your back, you can only look up."" (Like I said, I thought he was getting baked all day in the basement or something). What I finally came to understand he meant was when you are at your lowest, things will get better. He also used to say life is a bouncy ball, ""The harder you throw it down the father it bounces up.""  In retrospect, I have added, ""but he never told me about the people that love to kick you when you're down, and the other ones that will take your balls and run."" Regardless, I began to understand more of his odd sayings as they all rushed into my empty head. Here is how his phrases helped me. 

Another one he used to say is, ""Nothing ever changes if you don't change something."" I was put in a psych hospital when I was 17 for losing the will to live. When they let me out was when I understood that one. If we keep doing the same things, the same things will keep happening. So, when I got out I walked away from my life and started a new one in a completely different state. That helped a lot. No, really, it helped a LOT! Going someplace new with nothing but yourself and those YOU choose to stay in contact with forces you to see things differently. It becomes a sort of rebirth that gives you more control over your life. I have recently used this phrase and started listening to classical and ambient music instead of my normal Slipknot, Hatebreed, Killswitch Engage heavy metal music. It has confused the shit out of my brain sufficiently to (somewhat) quell the repeated screaming thoughts of suicide that I face on a daily basis just because it is so different. I don't typically listen to this soft lullaby stuff, but it's helping. 

In your current life, I imagine you have lost hope, lost the energy to continue dealing with this bullshit we call life, and lost the stamina to keep pushing forward. At least that's what happened to me. I just got diagnosed with Lupus because I guess the gods hate me, and chronic back and neck pain, fibromyalgia, manic depression, bipolar, and borderline personality disorder weren't enough. I have been out of work for the past three months for losing the will to live (again) and losing the will to care about anything. I am not going to lie and tell you I'm all better. I will never be all better. But I got back on track and remembered where I was in life before things started going south. 

All I'm saying is don't give up. Yes, jumping could potentially solve the problems you are having. They could make them 1000 times worse. I have attempted suicide over 5 times (seriously), and each time I failed; obviously. Each time, the results of those failures made my depression worse. The last time, instead of swallowing a bullet, I decided to do some things different and volunteered at a homeless shelter. It gave my brain different shit to think about. Volunteering at a homeless shelter might flip your brain around sufficiently to help jumpstart you back to your life again. Going for a road trip to someplace you wouldn't ordinarily go might do the same. Listening to different music might also change your direction.

Another one Grandpa used to say was the famous Einstein quote, ""Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result."" You don't strike me as one of those assholes in the world that love to kick a person when they are down. Stay with us and make the world a better place. Try something different and kickstart your brain into remembering you do have control over your life, you just have to remember how to turn it on. There is a lot to see and a lot to do in this world. Try it. It might help. It is helping me."

You cannot expect anything. We are humans, driven by some crazed notion that tomorrow will be better. Jumping is hard. Living through it is worse. Learning the pain that ensues from living through a failed suicide attempt is worse that death 10 times over. 

People that don't feel this way cannot understand like we do. The pain we feel. Emotional, mental, physical, it's unbearable. I understand. I wish you could see how much better the world is with you in it. People like us bring the assholes back in check. Because we feel so much. Don't jump. Please reconsider."

AskReddit,fft7q3e,t3_ev4ch1,1580211248.0,"It's not necessarily Coke itself that's good for a headache but the caffeine that helps. Caffeine opens the blood vessels, elevates your heartbeat slightly, and therefore pumps more blood, thereby reducing the ""pressure"" that we call headaches. If you look at the ingredients in Excedrin Migraine (or almost any migraine medicine), you will find the equivalent of about two standard cups of coffee worth of caffeine.

At least that's what I've found. I have severe migraines and have some quite a bit of research on things that might help. I can attest that Coca cola does help. Acetaminophen tears up my stomach so I usually stay away from the over-the-counter headache meds in favor of coffee or caffeinated tea."
depression,ffqdpcq,t3_etkvgj,1580131459.0,"Nobody is ugly. The word doesn't apply to people's outward appearance but rather their inward persona or personality. I've known a lot (a LOT) of people that were appealing to the eye but FUGLY because they had shit for a personality. 

Ugly is a socially perpetuated word associated with an individuals appearance. A person can put on a suit and tie, or an evening gown, and look nice, but still be ugly because either their personality resembles dog shit, or their behavior is more like the bowels of Satan. 

I don't know what you look like but I can say with 100% certainty, you are not ugly. The very simple aspect of you caring makes you better looking, inside and out. 

Just my $0.02 - (coming from someone who has been called ugly his entire life). I might be what society calls ugly, but when I give my time and energy to those in need, nobody says anything about how I look."

Next, there is no such thing as controlling people like us.  I'm 45 and still have the same problems. All we can do is learn how to cope with it in a safe manner.
