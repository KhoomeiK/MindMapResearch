stopdrinking,f5d4omf,t1_f5az0gu,1572148494.0,"My hair isn't breaking and brittle anymore. Once or twice (or four or five times) a month I would get it in my head that a bender would be a great idea. I would go out and drink Thursday, go to work Friday feeling like shit (in my industry it is not frowned upon), come home and then drink all weekend. By the end my hair would be greasy, yet dry and matted, as I didn't brush it or move too much while I was plastered. Now I don't do that, and also use silk pillowcases, so maybe it's just that. These weekend activities did not help with the anxiety either. 

As far as drinking goes, I have had a few sips (Once) of one of those .05 percent coolers, but I don't count that. I have seen that some people on here do, so I guess it depends on if you consider that drinking. 

Personally I think quitting is a good idea, even if it's hard. I basically decided that I had wasted enough years of my life and I should probably try to not be a POS, and maybe even try to make the world a better place, Try to not hate myself enough to want to date, and travel, experience the world before I checked out of it. I figure if all that doesn't work out I can continue my (ever romanticized in my mind) spiral, having at least put in some effort into being a participant in the world. I guess it just depends on why you want to quit, or drink less.

Glad you enjoyed the list, it helped me realize that a drink was a bad idea last night, even though I really wanted one, so I hope it helped you too."

* My anxiety has improved
* My hair looks so much healthier
* I eat healthier
* I don't spend Saturdays in a drunken stupor because I wake up and just want to keep going
* My Sunday anxiety and depression has subsided almost entirely
* I don't constantly hate myself, and have even looked at myself with kindness
* I have regained the ability to sleep somewhat normally
* I started going to therapy
* I got a new job with more responsibility in better pay in my field
* I haven't taken a shot and wondered if this or the 10 after, that I know I will have will be the one to finally fuck my liver up for good
* I've started keeping a diary again & writing for fun
* I'm closer to the person I want to be, and it has been a while since I could say that
* And I've started traveling a bit again (nowhere far yet) \*Edited to add this bullet point\*
