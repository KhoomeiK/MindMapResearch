Mothball is a mess. He's a loveable sweetheart, but a mess. He's barely 5 years old but he had to have his molars pulled due to stomatitis, and also has megacolon so can't poop very well. He always accepts other cats coming into and out of our lives. He's the best ambassador cat for the fosters I could have hoped for. One of the fosters failed and is now his darling adopted daughter. They bonded so fast and hard, when one wakes up in another room alone they'll cry until the other runs to them.  


Persephone is Mothball's daughter. She was obtained from a handicapped man's out of control cat colony he was having difficulty caring for. She was of the last litter born in that yard before everyone got fixed. Her brother and sister were adopted out. Persephone is a very anxious cat but loves Mothball strongly. She is very unfood-motivated but loves Capt'n Crunch squares and pizza cheese. Desperately wants pets but dances just out of reach unless Mothball gets pets first showing her she doesn't need to be afraid.  


Patootie is a little stinker. She is the only inside/outside cat solely because she is a violent sociopath. If triggered she will wrap herself around my arm like a tasmanian devil, and even gave me sepsis once. After nearly three years of behavior therapy we are at a place where she is rarely triggered, no longer overly aggressive with the other house cats, and is leaving fewer bird corpses in the backyard area. Soon she'll be able to be given a daily medication to help regulate her behavior to have a happier life. She had the traumatic experience of being the cat of the tenant who lived in my apartment before me. When inside she sticks to me like glue and only sleeps on my bed. Loves gentle belly pets and attention, and is very likely to eat food trash leading to smelly farts.  


Rogue is mine/my friend's cat. My ex-bf/friend's grandma found her screaming in a tree when she was about 6 weeks old. My friend and I lived in an apartment together with her and Mothball for a year before we broke up and I moved out with Mothball. One year later my friend's step-father hit him in the head with a bat, and his original prognosis was living in a persistent vegetative state until death, so I took Rogue home with me. I've had her for another year now and my friend is unable to care for himself but is doing significantly better than anyone ever expected. Rogue loves it when I take her to visit him. Rogue spent a large amount of time when first living with me sleeping in all the different cupboards. She has pica and will eat random garbage she pulls free from anywhere/everywhere, especially tinsel around Christmas. She gives the most sassy meows. Rogue has gotten over living in cupboards over the last few months and now prefers napping in sunny windows, especially the one by my desk."

Two disabled women (one is my aunt), a terrified friend with breathing issues, and my own food needs. I drop the bags by the front doors, then watch from a distance so they aren't stolen. They carry the bags in wearing gloves and wipe down the food with sanitizer/Clorox as best they can."

Plus ""A Rainbow of My Own"" being read aloud on youtube. It has a permanent reminder or rainbows in the art project, a interactive experiment to make a real rainbow out of light, and a story about rainbows to help them remember.
