dogelore,fqtzksv,t1_fqswy5p,1589649135.0,"the question makes sense if you already know you're trans, but i think a better question to a questioning person would be something closer to ""if you could permanently restart your life from birth as the opposite gender, with no say in what you look like, would you?""

most trans people would give that a hard yes because even if a man transitions into a woman and she's the ugliest woman on the planet, that's fine for her because she's a passing woman
