Connect with them & see if you can have a brief call and tell them about your mission and see how you can help each other.

Also - go to where the community is at: festivals, community events, etc."

LesbiansAGetHealthy,ep7r2fg,t3_bu36qg,1559085312.0,"Ok this might be hard to read and I don’t know your heart, but are you in love with her or are you obsessed with her? 

Hear me out. I dated this boy when I was 16 (HA!) and we really clicked and we dated for 4 months before he brutally dumped me. I for sure thought I was in love (turns out, I’m into women, but I still think this is relevant.) and honestly couldn’t get over him for almost 3 years. I thought about him all the time and always hoped we were going to get back together one day and always wondered what he was doing & stalked his social media.

I was just obsessing over the joy I felt like I had at the time & kept romanticizing the relationship and what it felt like to be loved. 

I also tried dating other people too and I just couldn’t get him out of my mind!!! I was so mad at myself like “girl what the heck you dated for 4 months and you were 16 get over it already!” 

Until eventually I realized what my feelings actually were and was able to let go.

So, my advice:

1. I think you should really, really think about if you’re obsessed with her bc that may be the case. And if it is, that’s okay!!

2. You say you don’t want to cut out the relationship bc you don’t have a lot of close friends... think about what’s more important to you, having her as a “friend” or feeling at peace? It might hurt now to not have a good friend but as soon as you start the healing the better.

3. Try making a list of all the things you don’t like about her, all the times she made you mad, all the reasons you aren’t good together. This is really, really hard and you’re probably going to be like “ugh there’s nothing she’s perfect” but really try. Keep adding to that list and keep reading it.

Any way, I’m so sorry you’re in this pain & I’m sending you all the love.
