womenstyleadvice,fr5bm07,t1_fr55dpm,1589905861.0,"I'm relatively small-busted and it makes it very easy for me to wear lower cut tops, deep vees, tanks with low arm holes and a cute bralette, etc. without being seen as ""showing too much skin."" Obviously I don't buy into the cultural norms regarding visible breasts being sexual/slutty, but it's nice to not to have to worry about my tits popping out of a shirt, and I know I can get away with showing more skin on top than a bustier woman without getting comments/stares.

I don't typically show it all off at once, either, so I may wear a lower cut top and then jeans, or if it's a lower cut dress I'll make sure it's a little longer, etc.

I do the same thing for skirts-I like showing off my legs, so if I wear a mini, typically the top is more covered up or loose fitting.

Maybe you could pick a favorite area or two to emphasize and work from there?"
womenstyleadvice,fr587y7,t3_gmm08v,1589904208.0,"I wear a size 10 shoe and have skinny legs, but I'm taller than you (5'8""), so these tips may not be applicable to you. Obviously, any clunkier shoes make my feet look bigger/stand out more, whereas slim-fitting, narrower shoe fits make my feet look smaller/stand out less. (This works for me because I have narrow and low volume feet.)

My feet look smallest in slimmer oxfords, ballet flats, skimmers, loafers and slim sandals (AKA not Birkenstocks, those count as clunky, even though I own several pairs). Oh and in dark colors, of course. I mostly wear black shoes so that's not a problem for me.

I very very rarely wear heels so can't speak to that, but I would imagine that elevating part of your foot would make them look less long. That said, heels hurt my feet, so I'll take them looking big."

It’s been fun for the most part because I love clothes, but also expensive and annoying. Partly because I didn’t expect to lose as much weight as I did, so I bought clothes along the way thinking they’d be permanent. Another annoying/expensive part was having to replace all my bras-I had a solid collection of nice lingerie that doesn’t fit at all. Most of the underwear still fits, but I like matching sets so it’s a bummer.

Plus I’ve got very specific taste and I know what I’ll wear or not wear, so if there’s nothing I like I’m SOL. So everything I had I already dug for, if that makes sense. I have a lot of cool pieces from smaller designers and now they don’t fit. So not necessarily grief but more like “Damn I put a lot of time, effort and money into building this wardrobe and now none of it fits.”

And right now it’s impossible for me to find tops I like aside from basic tees and tanks. I’m just not that into the spring styles this year. I’m seeing a lot of ruffles, balloon sleeves, etc. and my style is a lot more minimal when it comes to silhouettes and embellishments. So I have plenty of bottoms that fit and hardly any tops!

I’m lazy about earrings so tend to wear the same pair for months. I have diamond studs in a thin white gold bezel (which works fine with yellow gold), a pair of small yellow gold hoops from Ana Luisa that I’ve been wearing for months, and a pair of white gold and diamond “climber” type earrings that are very delicate and can also be worn hanging straight down.

For bracelets I have a rose gold bangle with an old European cut diamond in a square bezel, a chunky rose gold chain, a white gold and diamond “eternity” bangle by Simon G, and a couple of delicate chains in all 3 gold colors.

I have a ton of necklaces, that’s my favorite jewelry item to buy for sure. I like to have all lengths to cover different necklines. Most of my necklaces and pendants are simple and geometric.

I also have a lot of rings in various metals and styles, but again, usually clean/geometric/architectural in style.

I worked retail and got recruited by the store for a manager position. Because it was a smaller place it was easy to get involved in the buying so I did, and eventually stopped working as a manager and was a buyer full time. I traveled to showrooms, trade shows and wholesale markets, priced items, worked with budgets for each category, analyzed sales reports, etc.

I also helped launch their e-commerce website and did the buying for the site, as well as styling the photo shoots.

Pros: 

-Working in fashion is super fun if you love it-you’re surrounded by it, almost everyone working in the industry loves fashion and likes to talk shop

-Regular travel to NY and LA, covered by the company (plus I had no daily limits so got to eat at great restaurants for free)

-Free clothes from sales reps-tons and tons sometimes. One of my fave reps let me go through his sample rack for the season and pick anything I wanted, I got like 30 things 

-Fat discount on anything else (I could sometimes buy stuff for wholesale, otherwise 40% off)

-Seeing the tangible results of your work quickly-its fun seeing it in the store, and you know quickly if something is a hit

Cons:

-Pay isn’t that great

-Regular business travel gets old

-For me, moving up would have meant moving to NY to work for a bigger company and I just wasn’t interested in that. I wanted to buy all categories and the more I travelled to NYC the less I wanted to live there

-Market constraints, e.g. your customer base won’t buy something because it’s too pricy/fashion forward)

-Job is very affected by the overall economy. I didn’t feel like my job was super insecure but big events definitely affect the industry, like the crash in 2007-2008 and now obviously

-Some fashion people are exactly like the stereotype-elitist, shallow, generally shitty

3 terrible years later I’m finally stable, but I absolutely damaged my relationship with my husband. We’re doing well now but I feel super guilty about putting him through everything I put him through.

I also damaged my reputation at work. Luckily I didn’t do anything wild at work while manic, but my work suffered, particularly during the lengthy depressive episode I had after my last super duper manic episode. I’m getting a new boss and am hoping to turn my reputation around so I’ll be the go to person again.

I racked up tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt, so my credit score is now shit, and I won’t be able to buy a house for at least a couple of years.

And it seems minor, but I can’t do Ironmans anymore. I take lithium and my doctor says the length of the workouts could cause me to get dehydrated and then wrecked by lithium. This was actually one of the bigger blows because it was my first year doing triathlons and I put in so much effort to get to where I was. (I learned how to swim as an adult just to do them, took swim lessons multiple days a week, swam every day after work, etc., in addition to the runs and bike rides.

The long workouts were fantastic for my mental and physical health. (I was already diagnosed with depression and anxiety and ADHD.) Not to mention how fucking awesome it felt to finish the Ironman. So it’s just like “Oh great, I ruined my entire life and now I can’t even work out about it.”"
AmItheAsshole,fpzswo3,t1_fpy0456,1589023117.0,"If we do some highly speculative math, daughter is 16 and OP said she babysat during the kid’s toddler and elementary years.

OP was likely a teenager when she babysat, so let’s say she stopped babysitting for them when she was 18 (left for college?) before the divorce 4 years ago. That would make her 22 now. 

Theorizing aside, she’s almost certainly in her early 20s. SO WEIRD the daughter (and mom) aren’t on board with the 20-something former babysitter as the new stepmom.

Oh-YTA, OP."

AmItheAsshole,fporcdj,t1_fpmey8x,1588789330.0,"NTA. I've always been into medical stuff, bones, skulls, etc. I grew up playing in the woods and always got excited when I would come across dead critters, especially if it was a skeleton. I have a monkey skull in my living room, as a matter of fact, and I'm not even goth.

There is nothing wrong with being interested in anatomy, skulls, dead animals and such. You and your daughter clearly share the same interests, and I think it would be wrong to deny her access to her interests.   

Plus as a bonus, pretty much nothing grosses me out-I can watch surgery shows, look at dead animals up close and personal, etc. When there's a disgusting task to be done, it always falls on me and not my husband."

femalefashionadvice,fpfqja1,t3_gd32tg,1588579878.0,"I have several pairs of shoes that I’ve had for years. The oldest is my first pair of Dr. Martens that I’ve had since 7th grade, so 26 years old. I wanted them for so long and they were a ton of $ for my family, but my mom found a pair at Nordstrom Rack. These are super sentimental to me and I’ll keep them forever. They’re so beat up, I wore them daily. I don’t wear that particular pair anymore but I do have a ton of Dr. Martens I wear regularly.

I’ve got a pair of Birkenstock Boston brown leather clogs I’ve had for 25 years. My first boyfriend bought them for me as a gift. My husband actually wears them now, he wears like half a size bigger than me but his feet are twice as wide as mine. (They’re from before Birkenstocks came in Narrow and they’re super wide on me.) They’re a little sentimental I guess? But I’d probably get rid of them if my husband stopped wearing them.

I also have a pair of black leather Dolce Vita sandal/shoes that are open toed and lace up the front. They’re about 13 or 14 years old. This was when the brand first launched and they were higher quality than what I see from Dolce Vita now. I’ve gotten them resoled a couple times but other than that they’re going strong. No sentimental value but I actually still really like and wear the shoes, which is surprising given that my style/tastes have evolved over the years."

Of course babies are cute and fun and something to get excited about, but the reality is very different when you’re ready for a kid vs. not ready at all. (Or in this case, ready to help raise your college-aged kid’s baby.)

It sounds like OP pays plenty of attention to her grandkid, too, so it’s not like the baby was shunned and ignored. Definitely NTA."
