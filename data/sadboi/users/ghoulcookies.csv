Anxiety,foiub7q,t3_g6u4dj,1587797253.0,"I definitely needed to read this today. Thank you so much. I’ve been dealing with insomnia, chest pains, and shortness of breath over everything going on right now. Today I was so frustrated because all I want to do is get a good nights sleep without all the physical nonsense that anxiety brings. I try to meditate and that works for a few minutes but then the calm goes away and I’m back to feeling the physical symptoms."
Anxiety,foitejx,t3_g7m5kc,1587796408.0,I have these symptoms as well. Currently dealing with it as I write this. I’m fine all day until nighttime comes and it gets worse. I’ve started cutting back on caffeine and working out more and that seems to help a bit. I also agree with one of the comments about posture! It makes a huge difference when you remember to straighten your back. Feel better! (:

Anxietyhelp,fky7m8y,t3_fld8e8,1584643230.0,"Hi! I’m going through something similar. My fiancé and I live with my dad who’s elderly and my fiancé is the only going out everyday (for work only) so I get afraid that he’ll catch it and worry about him, then worry about my dad getting it and then myself. I’ve recognized that I usually get a really tight feeling in my chest, fast heart rate and shortness of breath when I get really anxious even before this whole pandemic started. I try to remember that those are usual symptoms of my anxiety but if I absolutely CANNOT get it off my mind then I take my temperature which proves to be normal and then I tell myself to let it go for at least an hour. Usually I’ll be fine the rest of the day after that. Other than that I’ve been keeping our house clean and sanitizing everything once my fiancé gets home. There are ok days and bad days definitely. I hope this kinda helps?"
Anxietyhelp,fkq998h,t3_fjva68,1584436108.0,I’m totally with you! This is the most stressed I’ve ever been and I feel completely helpless. I’ve broken down multiple times today and have just been letting myself feel everything as opposed to pushing it down. I’m thankful to have my fiancé and dad with me to lean on but I know the whole world is going through the same feelings of panic. Just know that you are not alone and we will all get through this together! ❤️

infp,f5mt67k,t3_doacwj,1572293423.0,What about becoming an art therapist? Seems like something you could do that’s creative and also help kids?
