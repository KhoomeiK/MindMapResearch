I completely understand why you feel like giving up on this relationship particularly when she's saying she finds it hard to make conversation and you're always the one to initiate contact, but try to remember this isn't her, this is her illness consuming her. She doesn't want to avoid you, she just doesn't have the energy for conversation, and I know that this is probably triggering your anxiety and causing your self-esteem to lower but I think you're doing a great job at trying to stick by her whilst at the same time battling your own demons. This lockdown is so challenging for everyone, and it's even harder for those of us with mental health problems, but we have to keep in mind that no matter how long it feels, it is only a temporary situation. 

I don't know if this will work in your relationship, but when my girlfriend doesn't feel like talking, I draw her pictures and send them in the post to remind her that she's not alone and that I'm still thinking about her. Or I just send her messages saying ""I love you"" and assure her that she doesn't have to reply. That way, she doesn't have to talk but it still lets her know that you're there for her. 

In the meantime, make sure you're taking care of your own mental health too because it can be really hard to help someone through depression if you're not feeling 100% yourself. Ask your friends and family for support, or reach out on here like you have done with this post when you feel like giving up. I know this situation feels unbearable, but it'll be worth it to keep your relationship so that you have something to look forward to when we're out of this lockdown."

It's important not to reinforce the behaviour of seeking attachment using suicidal gestures because this is unhelpful to everyone involved, it will just encourage her to keep putting her safety at risk. Instead, encourage her to take responsibility for her own wellbeing by telling her that you can't help her if she doesn't tell you where she is or what she is planning to do to herself, but at the same time reassure her that you care about her by telling her this even when she is not threatening suicide.

 When we are emotional, we enter the red area and our fight/flight instinct kicks in and we respond to the emotion in an appropriate way. However, if our emotions become too high, or we are in the red for a prolonged period of time, we can enter the blue because our emotions have become too overwhelming to deal with. We've surpassed the fight/flight mechanism and triggered the freeze mechanism, where the body plays dead (dissociates) in order to survive the situation.

The fact you only feel like staying alive for your friend out of guilt suggests to me that you don't really feel emotionally connected to anything in life because it's healthy to want to stick around for our friends because we enjoy their company and don't want that to end. You may still be able to get enjoyment from things, but you don't feel truly connected to them; you're possibly feeling quite empty and unfulfilled."

This will lessen over time the more you tell yourself positive things, keep pushing through that feeling of ""this is wrong/embarrassing"". There's nothing wrong with loving yourself, it doesn't mean you're big headed, it means you're a human being and you deserve compassion just as much as everyone else on this planet. Also try looking for evidence to back up these positive affirmations, and if you're struggling with this try asking your friends and family what they love about you."

So one year she hands me a present and my expectations are already low. I open it and couldn't figure out what it was meant to be, so I had to ask her. It was a piece of paper glued to a piece of cardboard about the size of a coaster. That was it.
