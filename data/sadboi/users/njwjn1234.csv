AskDocs,focm9u2,t3_g6tbaq,1587673011.0,"I had this exact same problem with seroquel it's called dysphagia and you need to tell a doctor ASAP, it may not escalate for you but I ended up with long term health problems as a result of being unable to swallow/swallowing too much air. Its a known side effect so it might be that they can help minimise the risk of damage."

SuicideWatch,fo0fxq0,t3_g4xms4,1587412420.0,"Hi love, I have attempted a number of times and although my life is still very much a bit of a shit show I am finding ways to deal with the overwhelming craving for the end.
Please try to find something small to stay alive for, in bad times I've tried to set a small goal (literally anything) and focusing on that until I'm able to calm down. I also put on headphones and blast a song that makes me feel anything different and often lie on the floor for grounding lol. I'd recommend going to a and e or calling a crisis line because they will listen and although they may not provide instant relief they may be able to get the ball rolling.
I never thought I'd survive but I promise this is not your only option, people care and want to help, even if it is not apparent.
Sending love and support from one human to another ‚ù§Ô∏è"
