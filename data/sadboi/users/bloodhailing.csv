> engage with ideas they disagree with

That's valid, sure, but Chomsky and Peterson are so fundamentally opposed on the way they see the world that there's nothing to gain, there. What nuance could be gained? The intracies of having cognitive dissonance? When he said that he likes Peterson for his self-help stuff, I left it alone, because he explained it fully. That makes sense to me. I don't know if that fits your vague definition of ""engaging with ideas they disagree with.""

If by ""engage"" you mean ""debate"", then that is the entire point of politics. The discussion on this sub lately, when it's there, has been whether to vote for Joe Biden. 

Considering this thread is calling for the ban of memes in favor of meaningful discussion, it would seem more people are in favor of debating ideas they might not agree with. Your air of superiority is without merit."

She really has no reason to lie, either; it's a successful band and they had a number of fans. On that same note, she told people to keep listening to the music if they want and it doesn't bother her if they do. From the tone of the post, it doesn't seem like she wants to press charges.

Mine is Hospice by The Antlers. It's a concept album about an abusive relationship told through an allegory/metaphor of a nurse caring for a dying cancer patient.

The abuser is a woman and the victim is a male. That was a situation I was in as a guy. It is the only piece of media I've ever found depicting a guy getting abused by a woman. Obviously not saying women are abusers here or that stories of women's pain aren't important (I felt like I needed to put that disclaimer). But a story like that is important to tell. I discovered it only three months after my abuser broke up with me for the final time. I was still in contact with her and expecting to get back together.

They say you don't know you've been in an abusive relationship until you've been told. That album told me. After I heard it, I didn't want to get back with her anymore.
