I suppose it could be buildup, it is just bizarre that we’ve changed nothing at all in our routine and the water has gone from perfectly pristine to completely green! 

My husband said it started around the daylight savings shift and is wondering if the extra hour of light seeping through the blinds could be it, but it seems like a minor change that shouldn’t lead to such an insane difference.

We will try to get some testing strips soon and check on the levels and try to identify what’s going on. Really appreciate your help!"

We’ve been cleaning out the filter and changing it regularly and doing the gravel vacuum/water change weekly. Definitely stumped by this! And not sure why the chemicals we used to clarify the water once don’t work anymore. But truly appreciate your help! Once we can go to the pet store again we will get our water tested."

The tank is by our door that has a window on it but the blinds are closed and we’ve been leaving their lights off more than normal. There hasn’t been any change in sunlight since the greenness started so we aren’t convinced it’s the sunlight."

loseit,fo4okv8,t3_g5d5tf,1587508215.0,"I love this. I so clearly remember downloading the Lose It app the same day our office ordered WAY too much pizza. I ate so much and tried to track it, but when it went way about my calorie restriction, I deleted the app and started my drive home in tears.

I randomly got this motivation that just said “NOPE” and whipped my car over to the gym. I had a bomb workout and almost burnt off all of the calories I went over. I went on a walk that evening and got the rest. That day kickstarted the healthiest 4 months I’ve ever had in my life.

I’m trying to get back to that, but I will always remember when I realized I could have pizza AND lose weight and how that made me feel so damn happy and it made weight loss seem actually possible. 

Eat the pizza. Do the workouts. Let bad days stay bad days instead of bad weeks. 

Thanks for this!!"

AmItheAsshole,eyqjyek,t3_cy4t2r,1567345554.0,"NAH. Seems like the biggest argument on the “NTA” side is that he had sex with her knowing the consequences. If he was telling you he didn’t plan to pay child support or was actively trying to skirt his responsibilities then sure, he’s an asshole. But he has the right to complain about something even if it’s his fault. 

Literally everyone I know who has a child complains about them in some way, even if the parents are happily together. People are allowed to complain about situations even if it’s their fault that they’re in them.

However, the people getting the brunt of their complaints also have the right to say “well, you got yourself into the situation.” 

Personally, if it wasn’t a super common occurrence, I probably would have reacted a bit more comforting, i.e., I know it sucks, is there anything (not financially) I can do to help, etc. If it continued, then I’d be more firm. But if it’s a one-off thing, I’d just allow yourself to be the verbal punching bag and support your brother."
