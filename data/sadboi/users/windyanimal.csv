BPD,fqkmh2j,t1_fqkgdwz,1589430631.0,"Generally, the most successful therapies you should attend are DBT and CBT therapies. I also have seen a few psychologists, psychiatrists, stayed in hospitals (never less than two weeks), taken medication, and moved into a healthy living environment. Perhaps the new and healthy environment is the most responsible for my progress. Everyone with BPD is different, it falls on a spectrum, like autism. But it can go into remission, and these therapies have an 80% success rate. 

These therapies work to retrain your brain, or ""untrain"" it, in order to shed all of the toxic beliefs and thought patterns you subconsciously hold onto and reveal who you are underneath everything by giving you healthy coping and communication skills. 

If you want more personal advice, like what I do for myself daily (because the true healing happens when you are by yourself, the therapy sessions can just prepare you for these moments), you can message me!

edit: I remembered to add that many people who suffer from abuse in early childhood develop an attitude of helplessness and victimization, and this goes against the grain of recovery. Once you are able to begin healing, you are no longer a victim, you are strength and power, and you rely on that to do the right thing."

She wouldn't hug me or let me know in any way that I was wanted in her life, she put her boyfriend first, who put me last in the family, and she saw me as a burden that she would suppress through screaming and sometimes violence. If I vomited into the slink before elementary school, I would get in trouble. I remember when I was 10 yo, i got a very bad cut on my leg at night and it would not stop bleeding heavily. I knew I needed help but I was so scared of waking my mom that I stayed in the hallway bleeding into a towel most of the night.

He needs treatment. 

Also, you aren't being selfish or unsympathetic just because you dont give him what he wants. You aren't someone he needs, even. You have needs too, and you have mental health issues, surround yourself with supportive people instead of people who make u forget yourself whenever they mess up."

BPD,flwb1uc,t3_frh0j8,1585544737.0,"With people who have BPD, who have had traumatic childhoods wherein important people can make or break their day, wherein their sense of self is not developed, idolize others because they are accustomed to other people determining the quality of their life, for better or for worse. So they expect someone to either be a monster or a savior, and it is pretty easy to fall in lust for a savior, even when you do not know them very well. Maybe this applies to you?

Measuring the success of your path to recovery should not be determined by whether you win over or ""scare away"" your FP, but by how well you can manage your own life despite their decisions, how effectively and honestly you can communicate, and how quickly you can stabilize yourself when you are overwhelmed by your symptoms. Also, I guess you shouldn't look at dating as a game where you can scare people away, because that belief may be a root of manipulative behavior, like the BPD symptom of altering who you are in order to keep people around. The right people will like you and stay with you.

Do you know what your boundaries are? Boundaries are normal for relationships, love should be ""conditional,"" most of the time, so simply telling someone your boundaries should not appear unusual to anyone."
BPD,flw02k3,t3_frfbwq,1585536237.0,"Many unintentionally are manipulative because manipulation has been a survival tactic at some point in their lives. I've gone to many psychiatric hospitals recently where people see every part of who I am, and feeling acceptance and compassion from people in my most candid moments has given me a game I can practice in the real world, and is quite exhilarating and fun for me:  say something brutally honest and see how people react. I get a rush when the other person doesn't bat an eye and simply accepts what I say, I feel actually connected to someone, and the friendship feels meaningful, and I don't feel like I hiding alone in the world and have to manipulate to continue hiding, which I feel brings on the cycle of splitting. Try it on people who you don't have serious relationships with first, it will make it easier to practice and their reactions will not matter as much as someone who is close to you. You will be surprised how accepting and compassionate most people are, not everyone is like your family.

One way I eased into to opening up in the hospital was to get others to open up first (not other patients, in case they were triggered). I was sitting in the hallway with some patients, and there was this EMT employee who began to talk to me. I had been feeling very guilty for a long time due to some recent events, and so I asked the EMT out of the blue, ""what is the worst thing you have ever done?"" Although he was thrown off by the question, he answered it honestly. I didn't have the courage yet to admit to things I wanted to admit to, but later I did have it and I was able to talk to people about what I felt so guilty over. In my next visits to the hospital, that EMT would always say hi to me, he bought me coffee from a store (never happens between patients and employees) and although it is against the rules, he gave me his full name so that I could write to him in the future and tell him how I am doing. I do not feel a fear of abandonment so much with people I am completely honest with, because I know that no person or experience can replace something real that we've made together."

Don't look at the big picture yet, your past or your future.  Build your life brick by brick, minute by minute. 

I  hope you can attend DBT. I was diagnosed with PTSD and  BPD symptoms grew from that yet DBT works for both issues.

BPD,f8x9wie,t3_e2rfi3,1574912350.0,"In a criminal case where psychologists needed a little girl to reveal who shot her and killed her sibling when she was too traumatized to talk, they asked her to write the name of the murderer on a slip of paper and then throw it into a fire. The 8 year old girl did this every day, and no one ever asked to see what was written on the paper. After some time (I forget how much), instead of throwing the paper into the fire, she handed it to a psychologist. 

I think this strategy will help you too. By writing every day you can build confidence in confronting the issues that you want to reveal to your therapist, and handing them a note rather than talking about it will offer you some emotional detachment from the situation, which may be more comfortable for you. This way, you maintain control over the disclosure of your issues without any pressure."

puppy101,f2igolo,t3_ddj8np,1570256980.0,"Buy lots of vinegar!!! To kill the smell of pee, big buckets of vinegar. 

 I honestly think the easiest way for you to potty train your puppy is to ditch the pee pads. If a puppy is accustomed to peeing on soft surfaces like a pad, then if you ever get carpet or visit a place with carpet, the puppy will mistake the feel of the carpet for a pee pad and relieve itself there. I live on the 3rd floor of an apartment, and while it does have a lift, I forgot about the lift for the first week or so of having the puppy and I carried the puppy up and down the stairs, and my dog is a much bigger breed than a corgi, so it is possible. 

If the puppy pees anywhere you dont want her to pee, simply pick her up, and put her where you want to pee. I think if you cannot directly supervise your puppy, someone else should, or the puppy should be crated so that they cannot make accidents or tear up anything without you noticing. This probably sounds like a lot of work, and it is, and that's why having a puppy is so hard. You have to alter your whole schedule to conform to their needs and it is exhausting. 

The quickest way to potty train, and not have continuing accidents due to confusion or being unsupervised, is to commit to taking the puppy outside when she needs to pee, and that could be every 15-20 minutes. puppys dont have control of their bladder, which means that as well as being unable to hold their pee, they also cannot let out as much pee as they need to at a given time, which is why they might pee so often. I hope this helped."
puppy101,f2e2e9d,t3_dd4543,1570176594.0,"Growing is exhausting and puppies typically sleep 18-22 hours a day!

As another commenter said, go to the vet if it really worries you. But for some perspective on lazy dogs, I read about a woman who had a Chow Chow and asked her son to take him for a walk. Not soon after she got a phone call from the son, asking to be picked up because the dog refused to walk any further. She went to pick them up in the car and found that they were only a block away. So some dogs are homebodies, and if he plays just fine with other dogs then he sounds healthy. 

Honestly I am envious that your dog prefers to walk rather than trot. My puppy still likes to pull, and tries to dictate the direction we go in. You sound like you have a sweet puppy!"

Dogtraining,f2d3hhx,t3_dcz1x3,1570146523.0,"with this response I am assuming you do not take your puppy outside enough, or watch him at all times, I apologize if this isn't the case with you:

With puppies the general rule is that you should not let them out of your sight while they are still being house trained, as well as for safety reasons. If you are only finding puddles of pee, but don't catch him in the act, then he is not close enough to you. This is the benefit of crate training: puppies will not want to pee where they sleep, so if you put the puppy in the crate during times you cannot supervise him, then you can schedule when his next potty break will be. However, you should not crate him all the time. Puppies need constant care, and should be taken outside every 15 - 20 minutes. 

If startling your puppy gets him to stop peeing until he can be walked outside, it seems like he understand that peeing inside is unwanted yet he simply cannot hold his pee long enough to be let outside. It took my friend 6 - 8 months to fully potty train her dog. I think you and your mother just underestimated how much supervision a puppy needs and how long it takes for their bladders to develop control. If you cannot supervise him/take him outside so often, try splitting the task with other people, whether it be a family member or a dog walker/sitter that you hire. Also, please reward your puppy with tons of treats and praise when he does pee outside. 

To help you understand a puppy's bladder control: Puppies not only have a hard time holding their bladder, but they also have difficulty with letting all of their pee out. That contributes to why they need to pee so often and sometimes pee after being let back inside."

puppy101,f1m0k4p,t1_f1m092e,1569579226.0,"Yes I try my best to not let him get to the cigarettes! I'm just curious as to why they are so enticing to him.

Thank you so much for the tips, the method of having him drop something in exchange for a more enticing treat is something I can start teaching him right away."
puppy101,f1m04u7,t3_d9uoer,1569578653.0,"Keeping toys/distractions outside for him to play with might help. Try to introduce some toys to him outside and teach him to play with them there, and that way he can focus his attention on something else. 

I'm not experienced with barking dogs but I saw this tip from the dog training show ""It's me or the dog."" lol"
puppy101,f170o9a,t3_d83qom,1569231497.0,"It gets better, adjustment is hard. On the first few morning with my puppy, I would wake up and lie awake in bed, just dreading the day to follow. Great things take time and patience. And do not beat yourself up over mistakes. Many people on reddit act like you need to be perfect right off the bat, or else you are neglecting your dog or something. You will make mistakes, you will feel bad, but you will also grow! 

Is there a place in your home that does not have carpet that you can limit him to? Get an enzyme cleaner to get rid of the pee smell in the carpet, or get rid of the carpet if you can, lol. Try buying some indoor puppy fences to keep him contained, and take him outside often. You will be scrubbing the floors and taking him out a lot, the goal is to have an outside pot that smells of his pee and nothing inside that smells. 

I think you can handle it. I think these feelings are completely normal. The only thing that makes ur experience not a fantasy is that lots of bad emotions and doubt are thrown into the mix of getting a puppy."

This man has a history of endangering people's lives, which is why he lost his job at the hospital, so I don't think she in anyway influenced him to murder his family. I think he would have gone on to hurt more people whether he met the cam girl or not, so I don't think her standard attitude of thinking only for herself is something to consider in this case."

If a man thinks there is a relationship, it is his fault. Many men seek companionship and conversation from sex workers, but the fact that they require a price shows in plain sight that any interaction is a business deal. This cam girl did not instigate his bad behavior, if you research the case at all, he was showing problematic behavior as a nurse that could've cost patients their lives, and was fired, before he ever met this cam girl. The man is sick, the cam girl is innocent, and its ridiculous that out of the both of them, she is the one in this video, and by you, being called the manipulator. Please do some research before calling others idiots."

jimcantswim,eyri3r6,t1_eyrgr1q,1567369211.0,"She never gave the illusion of a relationship, their relationship existed on a pay per service basis. 

So often I think men try to pay for fake girlfriends through cam sites, and then claim that they were manipulated as a means of guilt tripping sex workers for not giving into the men's desires."

jimcantswim,eyps1jf,t3_cy316n,1567309348.0,"Really disappointed in the commentary in this video: A cam model gave exactly what she advertised yet was the one called manipulative in a video about a guy who lied to her about his income and killed his entire family and covered it up. The video not only shows her face and gives her name, but even guilts her for not donating in the end, as if she owed anything to the family she did not even know existed. This woman did nothing wrong.

It seems like an outdated attempt to vilify the woman in the sex industry and blame her, and porn, for the man's actions."
puppy101,eyovtcm,t1_eyoujqq,1567284200.0,"Also, tail wagging isn't about affection or preferences, it is about excitement. Strangers are exciting, owners are not."
puppy101,eyovn2f,t1_eyoujqq,1567284112.0,"The fact that he is a Shiba convinces me moreso that what you are going through is normal and nothing to worry about. As long as you play with him, build trust with him, and love him, he will bond with you. Dogs dont think ""I dont like this person's personality and I would prefer to be with this other person instead"" 

I have an Akita Inu, and I asked a question about bonding, specifically about how my puppy was more excited for strangers than me, on a japanese dog breed facebook group. Some of the owners who reponded talked about their Shiba Inu bonding. I will paste some of the replies for you: 

"" Your Akita is still young. The bond develops as time go. My shiba matured around 2-3 years old and I became the special person that gained her loyalty.
Stay positive and work on that bond and your Akita will let you see in time ""

""Tbh, it took time for me and my Shiba to bond but when we did it was STRONG. I think primitives take longer because of their independence. But also, like others suggested, you're not always gone/new like strangers are haha. Stick with it! You'll get there.""

""It’s the same for my shiba at first. But he loves us so much now that he could not bear to part with us.""

""My Shiba never wags for me. But, we have a strong bond. Don’t worry you’ll get there.""

Since this group is more familiar with the Japanese dog breeds like Shibas than a general puppy subreddit is, maybe you can ask your question there and get some more replies from experienced Shiba owners. The facebook group is called the ""Nihon Ken Forum"""
puppy101,eyoms2n,t3_cxze6n,1567279692.0,"What breed is your puppy?

I recently got a puppy and I have been going through the same thing, and have asked a lot of dog owners about their opinions. My puppy never wags his tail for me, but go berserk over strangers. 

I am told that it takes time for a puppy to bond with you. Many owners have told me that it they did not feel bonded with their puppy until the puppy was around 6 months old. I think it is way too early for you to judge the bond between you two. 

Someone told me to think of it like this: you are like a mom to a child, setting the rules and boundaries, giving boring schedules, ect. Kids often want to run around and find exciting strangers who do not set those rules. However, as the kids grow up, they grow to appreciate their moms more and recognize the bond they have. 

Also, as for nail clipping, you should only clip the nails when you can hear the nails touch the floor while he walks. And you should first train him to be comfortable with you holding his paws gently and patiently work up to using the nail clippers on him, rewarding him with treats the entire way. The puppy needs to associate positive treats with otherwise uncomfortable situations, and using force on him makes the situation even more scary. I recommend a video by a youtuber called Kikopup, type in ""Kikopup clipping nails"" into youtube.

I have only had my puppy for a short while, and I felt so sad in the beginning. What you are going through is not unusual at all. Please let yourself be optimistic, I think you will see improvements soon."
Dogtraining,eynurmr,t1_eyntv00,1567262519.0,Okay thank you. There is so much pressure online to have all these tricks and obedience training done early on that I feel like I am failing on bad days.

puppy101,eyir6b2,t1_eyioas8,1567106399.0,"Thanks for your response, may I ask a quick question?
When she did make accidents in the house, did you discipline her in any way? Or use only positive reinforcement to teach her?"
puppy101,exkb8wk,t1_exkb5rx,1566382610.0,"Also, I do not think a puppy at 8 weeks old should be crated for longer than two hours. That is what I have read online anyway, I know everyone has their different ways of doing things that works for them."
puppy101,exkb5rx,t3_cteozv,1566382490.0,"My puppy began to cry loudly on the second night, ALL NIGHT, so loud that my apartment neighbors woke up and the neighbors across the street could probably hear. I had read that giving in to a puppy's whining and letting him out when he cries reinforces the behavior, your response tells him that whining will get him what he wants. 

Since I was so scared of my landlord telling me to get rid of the puppy due to the whining disturbing the neighbors, I resolved to wear tough skin, and ignored my puppy's whining completely on that second night of having him, so that I would nip this issue in the bud as soon as possible. It seems emotionally cruel, but it worked for the puppy and I. The third night, he whined for only 30 minutes at most. After that, he has never whined at all during the night. Whenever he needs my attention during the day, he will either come up to my lap and sit, or stare intently at me from his crate and maybe paw the door. 

Maybe commit to a few days of ignoring your puppy's cries, and maybe talk to your neighbors about what you are about to do so they are prepared and understanding. I hope this helps a little bit and best of luck to you. 

&#x200B;

Oh, and the same goes for barking. I totally ignored him and turned around if he barked at me, and when he became quiet I would turn towards him again and praise him. It seems to have worked because he never barks anymore either. I am not a an experienced dog trainer at all, but the simple practice of praising what i want, and ignoring behaviors that I dont want, seems to send a very clear message to my puppy."

puppy101,exd5mhx,t1_exd1jyy,1566167833.0,"Whenever my puppy tries to jump on me, I turn around (which forces him to get back on his feet) and ignore him for a few seconds. As soon as he sits and is calm, I turn around and reward him with praise or a treat. You could maybe tell strangers who want to say hi to your pup that they should turn around if he tries to jump on them before you let him make contact with them. 

Perhaps California is dense with dog owners. I live in a big city in France, and many of the people who come up to my puppy are tourists."

But like you said it feels so rude when the strangers come up and handle my puppy without even acknowledging me. I would like them to gain my consent first, and then I will gladly thank them for saying hello to my puppy and helping me socialize him. 
I like your point about strangers being a part of training, and I to my best to use that perspective from now on, so thank you :)"
