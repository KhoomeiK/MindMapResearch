Anxiety,fnvqsh5,t1_fnv27kt,1587302257.0,Lol same. I definitely give myself headaches and body pains. Im so tense my jaw and neck hurt. When the slightest sensation arises my entire body is like omg what's happening time to panic. I feel bad for calling my doctor so often but I know we're not alone right now. She told me that over half of her patients last month were calling for anxiety.

depression,fnizhl9,t3_fy1mcn,1586989150.0,"Wow. This post could have been my exact words besides the Lexapro bit, tried that with a bad reaction. I feel like I'm at the end of the rope. I can't stop thinking about suicide. I try to stop the thoughts or think other thoughts but they're so overpowering and intrusive. It's soul crushing. I hope you're in a better place this week."
PanicAttack,fmsjac3,t1_fmsilzf,1586356586.0,I'm not on any meds. Tried Lexapro once and had a negative reaction. I've had this sensation before and after taking it. Idk if you've ever taken a hot shower and experienced a head chill /scalp tightening sensation but that's what it feels like and it's warm and it can be there for hours.
PanicAttack,fmqwvni,t1_fmqqp2b,1586308814.0,I get the feeling sometimes if I'm in a nice hot shower and I enjoy it. I don't enjoy it all the time and when it comes out of nowhere I get a surge of panic as well.
HealthAnxiety,fmpu7lv,t1_fmpmig8,1586287420.0,Glad it got better for you. It is extremely unpleasant.
Anxiety,fmpn8bw,t1_fmpkhli,1586283840.0,Hm that's interesting I'm usually good about drinking plenty but im going to keep this in mind.
HealthAnxiety,fmpmo8w,t1_fmplmvn,1586283556.0,"That's what I'm trying to find out! It's sooo uncomfortable. I had a bad reaction to Lexapro once and had this same feeling but even more intense. I'm not sure if this is what people are describing when they say they have ""brain zaps"" but I have it frequently now with no meds."
Anxiety,fmplgoj,t3_fwou4i,1586282939.0,It's not related to a cold sensation. It can happen when I'm hot and sweating. It's just and uncomfortable tingly shocky feeling

HealthAnxiety,fm9y2by,t1_fm9xooj,1585879171.0,"Hopefully it's something as simple as that. I have been sitting at work more than usual this week as well as going for long walks in the evening, usually a few miles. It's just odd that I get the feeling only at night. 

Oh well hopefully my Dr can  givee me some answers. Sucks that we can only do phone visits for the time being though.

Thanks for making me feel like it's possibly not a big deal."
HealthAnxiety,fm9x9ff,t1_fm9x0uy,1585878640.0,"Well thank you, I hope you are correct. I've definitely learned that over the years! Trying not to let it get to my head for now."
HealthAnxiety,fm9wrwp,t1_fm9wh1v,1585878326.0,About a week. Every night. No knowns disorders besides anxiety/panic/depression. I already had a televisit w my Dr set up for next week for a different reason so I'm going to bring it up. Just hoping it's the usual anxiety.
HealthAnxiety,fm9wd9c,t1_fm9w1yf,1585878064.0,"I'm a sonographer I'm on and off my feet all day either scanning or writing reports.

It only happens late in the evening. Just started an hour ago tonight & I haven't had shoes on since like 5. Last night I woke up in the middle of the night and felt it and couldnt get back to sleep bc it freaks me out."
HealthAnxiety,fm9vwy6,t1_fm9vmb1,1585877772.0,Nope I wear compression socks that are knee high and loose fitting nursing shoes. It was only at night for you too?
PanicAttack,flz317u,t3_fru49a,1585614436.0,Yep same. Lately I've been having panic episodes that last hours or days. Today was a decent day and I accomplished some goals I wanted to but about an hour ago this sense of doom started setting in again.
Anxiety,flypoqd,t1_flyjlkp,1585606660.0,Unfortunately I haven't found anything that really helps besides distractions. If I'm not thinking about my anxiety or breathing I can go on just fine without the yawning and shortness of breath but the second it comes to mind it starts back up.
Anxiety,flu9t3u,t1_flswqig,1585498286.0,"It's an especially hard time for those of us with anxiety right now. If you don't have any of the symptoms you are probably okay. Just stay safe and practice isolation and social distancing and proper cleaning and hygiene. That's all we can do right now. I work in a hospital and we don't even have masks so it's very hard for me right now. I feel like Ive been infected every day. I haven't found anything that really helps me yet but my anxiety was already horrible before this mess, not necessarily brought on by it. I always live with the shortness of breath and chest pain and tightness. I have difficulty sleeping sometimes too and that only makes things worse. Sometimes it helps to reach out to others in similar situations so you know you're not alone. You can always message me if that would help you."
Anxiety,flg7iin,t1_flfo3zq,1585133791.0,Thank you! I did not connect the two at first but I'm thinking you're right
Anxiety,flg7g6l,t1_flf8qvt,1585133717.0,"After looking into it I think there could definitely be a component of gerd occurring that's making me even more anxious. Thanks, I'm going to definitely research that more and bring it up to my dr"
Anxiety,flg7bv6,t1_flfdcz4,1585133582.0,"Check out wim Hof breathing technique. There are videos on YouTube, he was on his Rogan a few years ago and I believe there is a documentary out there as well. Supposedly has many benefits including stress relief."
Anxiety,flei92l,t1_fleczlw,1585084902.0,Thanks I'm a medical professional as well and I've been checking my temp daily at work as per our current guidelines. I also check my oxygen saturation when I'm totally breathless. I haven't had any fevers yet but my brain isn't always the most logical.
Anxiety,fle4p45,t1_fle1thv,1585077542.0,"Ive been convinced it's everything from cancer, also a former smoker/vaper, thyroid issues and the virus. I have allergies but I've never experienced this symptom from allergies. Something to definitely look into though. The shortness of breath and chest pain is something I experience all the time, for months at a time when I'm going through times of elevated anxiety. I just got some Klonopin yesterday and I haven't used it but it's such a relief to know it's there in case of emergency."
Anxiety,fle49wd,t1_fle3xwn,1585077316.0,Thanks that gives me some hope! Trying tonight after work for sure
Anxiety,fle3rbl,t1_fle2sut,1585077042.0,I just heard about the wim Hof stuff. I'm definitely going to check it out. The shortness of breath and yawning is killing me.
Anxiety,fldw6v9,t1_fldw42l,1585072902.0,Thanks I'll definitely do that when I get home. I've been doing the wrists and face here at work
Anxiety,fldvzge,t1_fldvvld,1585072784.0,Ok sorry man. Im literally at my breaking point right now.
Anxiety,fldvo18,t1_flde362,1585072607.0,"Ok? Pain isn't the caus of my anxiety so massage therapy does nothing for it. Of course I read the paper obviously. In case you missed out I'm asking people that have experienc what THEIR opinion is in the best time to take it and when they found they had the least symptoms from taking it. Believe it or not that's not included on the paper and my Dr doesn't have that answer either. I'm aware of the side effects, that's why I'm terrified of taking meds. I'm at my breaking point. Hence literally everything I have said"
Anxiety,fldnsc0,t3_fo6h6w,1585068216.0,Yup my main symptoms are always chest pain and shortness of breath to the point I feel like yawning and gasping for air. Right now I have had a super dry throat and a sensation of having something stuck there for about three weeks and a cough that I think is me trying to get rid of that sensation. Of course this is making me panic more but I'm trying to remind myself the the mind is a crazy thing and all of these sensations are commonly experienced as a symptom of anxiety. It's like I'm sabotaging myself by knowing those of the symptoms and manifesting them. Still freaking out though
Anxiety,fldm4l2,t3_fo6apf,1585067283.0,I'm right there with you dude. Also working in healthcare and have no desire to be there. My company is doing nothing to protect the employees or the community and is even telling us they are going to be putting us in a more risky position for no logical reason. My anxiety is at an all time high. Day long anxiety attacks. Multiple panic attacks daily. Just broke down and got my first ever scripts f I'm my Dr yesterday. I do not want to be medicated at all but it's my last resort. I would 100% quit my job if it wasn't for the fact that I can't be uninsured right now. Also started with the super dry throat for the past few weeks and feel like something is stuck in there. Don't normally struggle with depression but this crippling anxiety is making me need some kind of escape. It's so shitty. Let me know if you need to talk.
Anxiety,fldd4wg,t1_flda2xb,1585062054.0,Did the Lexapro reduce your anxiety to a manageable level and did you have panic attacks? I'm going to try not to use the Klonopin and just keep it as a rescue in case of emergency. It's reassuring to know it's there if I really need it. I hope you find a regimine that works out for you.
Anxiety,fldctfd,t1_fldagv5,1585061862.0,My doctor just told me it's okay to take the Lexapro anytime I want and to try not to take the Klonopin at all unless it's an emergency. I'm just curious what has been most effective for other users with the lest negative effects. She was reluctant to even give me Klonopin but I'm really afraid of my anxiety becoming worse before it gets better and having a massive panic attack that I can't handle. Of course I know it's different for everyone but hearing other's positive results gives me hope that I otherwise don't have.
Anxiety,fld5skp,t1_fld528m,1585057268.0,"Yea that's what I'm afraid of I just don't know what else to do. I work in a hospital and it's effecting my ability to do my job. I've tried it all therapy, yoga, meditation, exercise, diet, light therapy, massage, art and writing, reading, aromatherapy. I just feel hopeless. Thanks for your opinion, I appreciate all feedback."
Anxiety,flajspt,t1_flaj4dm,1584985280.0,"No worries that's exactly how I am also reacting, panic attack city over here with no meds. & I'm in the good ol USA, in upstate New York. I've strongly considered quitting. It's not the money keeping me it's the health insurance. Really afraid if being uninsured during a global pandemic."
Anxiety,flahdm9,t1_flaga6q,1584983907.0,"Exactly. We have been told that even if we have contact with a confirmed case we are to come to work and check our temp once a day. I'm panicking for myself and my patients. Also, 99% of my patients are high risk :/"
Anxiety,fla718h,t1_fla3jkl,1584977992.0,Protective equipment like masks. Healthcare workers all over are going through the same thing. & Thank you. That's what I'm thinking and hoping too!!
Anxiety,fla2x2o,t1_fla25gk,1584975447.0,"No I'm not convinced of that, I think it probably is anxiety but my anxiety is not very rational. The cough probably is too. My anxiety takes so many different physical forms. I'm just trying to see if that's a common experience for people here. 

I'm just very anxious right now, working in a hospital, no protection. Having panic attacks every day. Afraid to ask for meds bc I've read they suppresses immune system and increases chances oh pneumonia."
Anxiety,fla18ha,t1_fla0hdn,1584974369.0,That's not really an option right now. I they aren't seeing nonemergent cases. I've had the shortness of breath for years any time I'm anxious.
PublicFreakout,fl6n0eo,t1_fl6jlpp,1584876235.0,"That's what I'm looking into now. I'll survive without toilet paper, I'm not going to die without it. Just sucks some people feel the need to buy out the stores. Glad to see more stores enforcing limitations though."
PublicFreakout,fl6mve4,t1_fl6eiom,1584876068.0,"I did order from hello fresh for next week so I'll have meals. It's things like paper products, water, bread and stuff that I haven't been able to get. Can't find them online either. I'll survive, I have quite a bit of rice and beans to get by on and I actually found a filter."
Anxiety,fl5r7hs,t1_fksghyv,1584843639.0,"This is exactly what I do! I yawn all day long all the time and people always ask if I'm tired. Nope, just anxiety and I'm trying to get a satisfying breath. It freaks me out when I try to yawn a few times and I can't I start to panic a little."
PublicFreakout,fl5ekqy,t3_fmoor0,1584834890.0,"It's just wonderful being an essential employee, going to work at the hospital before the stores even open and having all the shelves wiped clean by the time I get out. I don't know how we are supposed to get supplies to sustain ourselves. Fuck any one of you that's out there hoarding any more than what is essential right now. The people keeping you supplied and caring for you and your families can't get the things they need."

Anxiety,fjzbra8,t3_ffmbsc,1583716007.0,Yes I feel this too. I get overwhelmed. Every little thing that happens and even the slightest symptom terrifies me. Panic. Then I'll have moments of calm And almost always end up crying. :( I'm not sure but I've only considered it to be anxiety up until this point.
Anxiety,fjzbj0y,t3_ffmg4j,1583715853.0,*Hugs* I'm right there with you with the intrusive thoughts and I also fear the long term effects it may cause. It's pure hell. If ya ever need someone to talk to I'm here for you.

Anxiety,fjwjz93,t1_fjwbupn,1583640037.0,Hm I'm not sure but it seems like a possibility. I never feel this okay at night. I was in the midst of a panic attack earlier and have been just chilling since & I'm even feeling tired right now.

The palpations, racing heart, facial numbness and shortness of breath are the scariest.

I've also had blood work and heart monitors, ultrasound and 02 levels checked. All normal. Though I'd like to get my thyroid checked. All signs point to symptoms of anxiety.

Anxiety,fjkpak7,t1_fjkiabj,1583431221.0,Thanks you. I find that physical activity is the best thing I can do for my anxiety as well. I tend to be fine throughout the day but the minute I go to relax/sleep it's like my body is intense fear/anxiety.what you're saying about writing down your thoughts is very similar to the idea of noting on headspace but that actually sounds like a better idea. I'm going to try it for sure.
Anxiety,fja0iyx,t3_fc7ht5,1583163801.0,"I just went in and told her what symptoms I was experiencing. I also flush really bad and get a ""stress rash"" on my chest and neck easily when I'm uncomfortable and my ears turn red. That coupled with me heart rate being over 120 at my first visit I think she could tell right away. I really encourage you to make an appointment. I felt a lot better just being reassured and talking to a Dr. She did a few tests too that also made me feel better.

Anxiety is really common, they definitely won't think you're a scammer lol. They are there to help and will not think you're crazy for seeking out help for anxiety. Good luck!!"

 We are a specialty surgical practice with a competing practice in town. The docs are afraid we will lose patients if we say no of can't get them an appointment by next week. We actually lose patients because we're extremely overbooked and no one wants to spend 3 hours at the dr for a routine follow up."

All week long he makes staff add patients as we keep telling him ""were 5/15/20 patients over the cap"" he doesn't care. He won't say no. He will schedule 4 patients every 15 minutes for himself allowing <4 min per patient. Obviously unrealistic and patients take more than 3.75 minutes to see with means within a couple of hours into the day were likely at least an hour behind schedule.

Everyone in the office gets to deal with jerk patients yelling at them bc of the docs decisions then when he walks in the room it's all 😄 ""hey doc how ya been oh no worries about the wait"""

A few months pass and absolutely nothing happens until it suddenly grows two ridiculously long fronds (about three feet long each) while I was out of town.

I realized it needed more light so it now resides beneath a grow light. The crazy long fronds died off. A few months of nothingness later and three new fronds emerge. 

It has now been another two months and the fronds are a normal length but have not grown over the months.
