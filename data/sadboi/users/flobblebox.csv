SuicideWatch,fn6i331,t3_fzu0jt,1586699869.0,Are you sure you arnt just experiencing obsessive moments. Like people with an obsessive disorder tend to think of something then can’t get it out their heads and think of it over and over and hate themselves. I experience this and it wasn’t until I read about it that I managed to just move on from my sick thoughts and realise it’s just my mind trying to play with me. Please don’t think you are an awful person you just might have more of an obsessive and imaginative personality then others. I used to have the most fucked up thoughts but the moment I realised I was just being obsessive and managed to train my brain to just move on from those thoughts I realised I’m not a bad person I just get more caught up than others
Needafriend,fi9khbe,t3_f75nd3,1582269336.0,Hey! I used to live on the Sunshine Coast now I live in Perth! I’m on the same time clock as you so hit me up if you need a friend. I understand how debilitating loneliness can be and wouldn’t wish that on anyone. Maybe talk to you soon
SuicideWatch,fh7c762,t3_f19haj,1581324248.0,Dude life’s all about stories and you still have so many to write! Even tho you do hate life just hold on and add a few more stories then in a few years time reevaluate how you feel. I know life can be tough but just try hold on a bit longer
bipolar,f2qduq0,t3_dbqpwy,1570360251.0,Omg! I’m actually shocked at how many replies I got! Thank you so much this has helped me heaps! Didn’t realise so many people understood! It’s crazy how much I get obsessed with things! Mine lately has been the Beatles I legit end up going into Beatles mania and my whole life is just about the Beatles! Haha and world war 2 hahaha
SuicideWatch,etscaxo,t3_cd60gp,1563141885.0,Woah dude that’s awful! Sounds like an obsessive disorder and your brains fucking with you because it’s a thought you seriously don’t want to have! I used to have it when I had episodes because it was so sickening to me my head used to constantly go back to those thoughts. You aren’t a freak! I know it’s fucking scary and disgusting and horrible but seriously dude it’s a mental health issue go and seek help ASAP you don’t have to tell them the thoughts! I never did I get how gross for anyone else to think you think that. But by the sounds of it you are having that so seek help for it and then if when you get that sorted and if you still feels this then maybe seek different help. Honestly tho it doesn’t sound like you are a bad person just one of the unfortunate ones given a complex mind. Good luck!
SuicideWatch,etsbqri,t3_cd7yk3,1563141472.0,Oh ok In that case my bad and that’s awful. Honestly man I’m a female I’m older and iv had some bad sexual experiences this is not one. You honestly did nothing wrong you got up and put one on. You miss read a situation that clearly is a big thing for you which is awesome and shows how lovely you are. You’re a good person clearly so don’t beat yourself up be proud this is the kind of person you are. Chin up you have done nothing wrong
SuicideWatch,etsad7e,t3_cd7yk3,1563140472.0,Haha in no way did you sexually assault her! I don’t really understand what she means by flash backs? If she’s saying what I think then she’s being ridiculous. Just chill out honestly you didn’t assault her!
SuicideWatch,ets9zyh,t3_cd8abw,1563140203.0,This is amazing! I seriously love this! Man if you need any help or someone else to help with the messages I’d love to help! Seriously consider it! You’re amazing I love this wish I’d thought of it!
SuicideWatch,ets9i0z,t3_cd8dfk,1563139850.0,"Holy shit I’m so sorry! What an awful hand you have been dealt! Honestly the fact you have gone through that and are still here shows your strength! 

Look I can’t sit here and tell you everything’s going to get better and something will come up cuz you don’t need or want to hear that and more frustrating to hear than helpful and I totally get that! But please don’t give up! Keep trying! If life has gotten to this point and now you’re feeling this way then maybe try something completely drastic you never would of dreamed of doing or always wanted to. You only have one life what more do you have to lose? 

Keep trying with the help! I was in the same boat in that situation, no1 was helping me it was fucked! After months of waiting I did finally start to get the help needed but it was fucked waiting but just keep that little bit of hope. I hope so badly something comes up soon. Perhaps some medication will help you, can your gp get you on something for the time being? 

Sorry for the novel! But honestly your story has the potential to be amazing and I really hope you keep trying cuz your success story when you get through this will be amazing and I really would love to hear it one day! Keep strong! Life isn’t about what you have in the end it’s about the stories you have that matter. Make more stories and just don’t give up yet

Loneliness is the most debilitating feeling so if you do ever need someone to talk to flick me a message, I won’t judge but I know how awful it feels to be alone. I seriously hope you are ok"

SuicideWatch,etpjsw1,t3_ccu2wa,1563057365.0,So glad to hear
Drugs,etpffi4,t3_cc99id,1563053994.0,It’s honestly never too late. I used to be a grade a cunt! But now I know I go above and beyond to be a good person and I feel like I’m slowly getting rid of that old karma. Honestly man just try hard to be a good person and forget about your past think about the present. It doesn’t matter what you personally have when you die all that matters is that you personally made an impact on the world! Your clearly a good kind person so just be that person and don’t dwell
SuicideWatch,etpf14d,t3_ccu2wa,1563053687.0,I’m almost certain bleeding out is an awful way to go. I’m so sorry you are felling this way! But don’t give up! Is there anything I can say to help? Maybe just a random stranger to vent to? Keep strong!
SuicideWatch,etpdoy5,t3_ccuhpc,1563052651.0,Fuck I’m so sorry your feeling this way! But if you have people to say goodbye to then you have people worth fighting for. You are loved please don’t do anything. Seek more help and explore every avenue and don’t give in just yet!
Drugs,etpdfri,t3_cc99id,1563052452.0,Been there my friend and it’s such a scary feeling and you never think there’s any coming back but there is! Just work hard and get off the drugs be patient and soon you will start feeling like yourself again and it will be the greatest feeling it’s so much better than any drug high!
Drugs,etpd8c0,t3_ccbqis,1563052288.0,Don’t touch meth!
Drugs,etpcl0t,t3_ccn27e,1563051779.0,Think you should seek help man. If you don’t recognise the signs now you certainly won’t in the future if your drug use keeps on. People won’t stick around forever don’t wait until it’s too late. Good luck just keep strong and good luck

Drugs,etp5twe,t3_cco2ek,1563046526.0,"Dude the fact you are writing on here just shows that you know it’s not ok and In Theory you have taken the first step by discussing it. Man I went through my own struggles with drugs and last week was a year since it officially all came out and I ended up In Hospital with everyone finding out how bad I was but still I fuck up all the time I went 4 months clean and then fucked up and now every couple months sometimes every few weeks I lapse but I still keep trying and I learn every single time I fuck up because I make it a lesson. Keep trying and go at your own pace no1 can tell you how your journey is meant to go and how long it will take. Maybe this spiral is just you realising it’s coming to an end and getting scared. You got this man you can tell you want what’s best so keep trying!

And I wouldn’t suggest other drugs to help get you off it. You have a substance abuse problems so adding different drugs is adding to the problem! See your doctor and get something to help you with the first few weeks. I use seroqual super handy"

Drugs,etowdd8,t3_cckoqy,1563039313.0,Dude as that friend that lost myself on meth and really jeopardised my friendships and relationships with everyone in my opinion and my advice tho not the same for everyone I found that when all my friends started pulling away and I was left going crazy alone that I realised I need help but also my friends were there every step of the way if my recovery so pull away till they realise then be there they will defs need a shoulder to cry on during this journey
Drugs,etoqr2i,t3_cco2ek,1563035114.0,Dude I used to feel like that when I first spiralled out of control but I was the same as you just constantly getting that lit bit deeper but seriously stay away from meth man! I was always the same for years would spiral and then get better but then I met meth and fuck me I couldn’t pull myself away! Now it’s just over a year since I slit my wrist and ended up In hospital because of it and still to this day I struggle even tho I see someone weekly for help I smoked it last night even tho it destroyed my life and I hate it I slip so don’t get involved it’s a nasty drug so nasty
Drugs,etopybk,t3_ccn6w4,1563034507.0,Dude stay away from meth! It’s a nasty drug! It takes over your life and before you know it your constantly trying to be strong enough not to chase! Stop smoking meth after getting hooked just over a year ago but even now I’m high cuz it’s just so hard not to fall sometimes! Tend to fall every 2 months. Do not let yourself get involved with this nasty drug! Always believe you are better than that because you are!
