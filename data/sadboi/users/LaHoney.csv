confessions,fdqj8le,t1_fdq6nez,1578668012.0,"Truly I have NEVER felt that she has loved me and really only doesn't want me to say or do things just because SHE would somehow make it about herself most of the time,not because she actually cares. I feel like maybe when I was younger and more obedient yeah but it seems like she gave up on me once I reached my late teens and started saying what I wanted,did some things I wanted and even the smallest things like get a septum piercing. As much as I want to remove her for my life, I currently can't but once I'm done with community college,I'm out. I can't see myself keeping contact after I leave or go back to her."

mentalhealth,f5vnagi,t1_f5vn5qy,1572493637.0,"Yeah I know I should know this but I've practically grown up without my two siblings because I was the youngest and they were long gone by the time I was about 8 years old. So I really couldn't tell if this was normal or not,you know?"
AskReddit,f4w4igi,t3_dm263t,1571851694.0,"For me,I really became impulsive and careless. I used to drink,get high,have sex with anyone and self-harm. I did almost anything I could to feel better or to fill a void,having the mindset that no one really cared if I did these things anyway. I've made some situations worse for myself and I am the queen of consistently changing myself because I don't really know who I am, I literally have one other alter(ego) that comes out whenever I feel down or whatever but literally I don't know what I want to be or who I should be right now. Sometimes,I dissociate so much if I'm ever under a stressful situation or I don't know anyone or anything around me. 

But with others, I lash out on people whenever I had a bad day or they said something bad to me and I never really meant it so I always had to apologize until I learned to push myself away so I don't hurt anyone. And ofc I had a favorite person but I always had to distance myself in case I lost them due to my outbursts. When it came to romantic relationships,I always had to ask questions and needed reassurance that I'm not doing anything wrong and I always feel like a shitty person if I do. 



Overall I'm better at handling it,I'm not as impulsive and random as I used to be but I still struggle like with the thought of not carving myself up or if I'm going to be me today or if I'm going to be Honey(ego) today and if I can fully love someone without being so distrusting of them. 

Hopefully it makes sense but this is my experience."
depression,f4un9mw,t3_dlp6ws,1571819144.0,"Yes,I'm only 19 and I have always suffered depression from a young age and developed really bad anxiety and PTSD within the past couple years of my life and I cannot remember any stressful situation that has happened to me or any depressive episodes I've had. I can't even remember most of my highschool life except bits and pieces because I've always been under so much stress during those 4 years. I get really anxious when it starts sounding really familiar if I tried hard enough to remember.

It really sucks. Sometimes,I think I'm the only one who has this issue and sometimes I'm glad I don't remember. I like to think of it is a way for the brain to protect itself from the trauma or emotional distress though that may not be the case. I wouldn't wish this upon anyone because it's really scary not being able to remember a period in your lifetime even if you sat there and tried."
