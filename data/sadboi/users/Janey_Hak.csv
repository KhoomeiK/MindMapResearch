Borderline,fghu32d,t3_eykr8f,1580793894.0,"We can‚Äôt diagnose anyone, including your mother. It sounds like she‚Äôs been emotionally abusive to you for your whole life. Maybe she does have her own trauma or diagnosis, but it seems like she‚Äôs in no way ready to admit that or explore it with a therapist or talk about it. Having borderline does not equal or excuse being abusive in the way that she has been. So it‚Äôs not too relevant because she‚Äôs not going to accept help or reconsider her actions. 

My view is that you need to take care of yourself until you are able to get away from your mum. Maybe this means when you finish school you get a job and share an apartment with friends, or go away to college, I‚Äôm not sure of your situation. But I really think that she‚Äôs not taking care of you, she‚Äôs actively hurting you more, and it‚Äôs bad enough that you should get out as soon as you can. 

Do you have an older sibling or aunt or family friend or some other adult (doesn‚Äôt seem like your Dad is helpful) that you could talk to for some help? Is your dads family better? Maybe your mums family know what she‚Äôs like and would help you? Do you have other friends who want to move out of home as soon as they‚Äôre old enough? 

Besides all of this - I want you to know that you are not alone. What she is doing is majorly shitty. I believe you. It is not your fault. You deserve a loving caring supportive family and home. You do not have to stay in touch with anyone who is abusive like this, even if they‚Äôre your mother, even if they‚Äôre dying of cancer or blah blah blah excuses to try and get you to come back so they can be awful to you again. You never ever have to put up with that. You are your own person and you get to make that decision. 

Keep talking to your therapist. I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre in the USA and I‚Äôm not sure on the mandatory reporting laws - I think they only have to disclose information to parents/social services/police if they believe you are in danger, from yourself or someone else e.g. a parent, or they think you are a danger to someone else. I‚Äôm not sure if what‚Äôs happening to you is enough for social services to be called, sorry I don‚Äôt know enough about those rules, I‚Äôm in Australia. 

Please come back and keep talking if you want to. There are lots of people on reddit who will listen and talk and we care about you. This is not fair and it sucks, but you are strong and you can make it through. Stay safe friend."
trashy,fghcwsa,t1_fgg7arn,1580782035.0,"An Aussie guy made a documentary called ‚Äúthat sugar film‚Äù or possibly ‚Äúthat sugar movie‚Äù. He went into the history of the sugar industry and how it‚Äôs been pushed as an ingredient despite us knowing how bad it is. It‚Äôs as disturbing as alcohol, tobacco and guns. He visited the states and met a dentist with a mobile clinic who was treating patients with ‚ÄúMountain Dew mouth‚Äù, first time I had heard of it. It was terrifying to watch. He then went to a remote regional community in Australia, where there is only one store to buy food and drink, and looked at the health implications when you have no food choices. Like the ‚Äúfood deserts‚Äù in big cities where you can‚Äôt find fresh food for many blocks, this community was in the actual desert that a lot of Australia is. It is very expensive to truck in fresh fruit and veg thousands of kilometres to a small town, where people with low income cannot afford the high prices to offset that transport cost. So of course people bought the cheapest and easiest food. The cemetery was full of people who died far too young from diabetes related conditions. A government program was started so the only store started selling healthy foods, at affordable prices, there were cooking glasses and free drinking water taps. But then the funding for the program stopped and it just went back to how it was. 

It‚Äôs so fucked how people have the odds stacked so much against them from the start. Not to disempower people, but it‚Äôs clear to me that by growing up in certain locations and circumstances, a lot of people have a lot to work against to get to a healthier point.

I don‚Äôt want to act like autism is not something to be researched and adaptive help applied to.

I think my BPD traits come from having a narcissistic mother, but sometimes I‚Äôm not sure. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had sexual trauma as a child, I‚Äôve not experienced issues in relationships and I‚Äôm fine with being touched. 

But. There is a neighbour near my parents house, and he is a cop and lives with his much younger wife. Neighbour kids and I would go over to play with his daughters, they were younger than us and we would pretend we were their mums etc. Almost always the dad was home but not the mum. I remember going over sometimes by myself, and the daughters not being there, but I still went in. The dad would show me card tricks, tell me he was going to marry me and sing songs to me about this. I remember thinking he was kind of gross, but not understanding that it was wrong. I‚Äôm 90% sure I remember him showing me his penis and making me touch it. I don‚Äôt remember anything worse than that. 

I don‚Äôt remember me or the neighbour kids I saw regularly going over there at all once I was maybe 10 or so and older. His kids never left the house to come out and play like the rest of us did. He and his wife never came out either. I asked my sisters recently if they remember him being weird, they were 10 and 13 years older than me so I didn‚Äôt play with them there but they knew the family. One sister said he used to handcuff the kids to his bed. Like, what the actual fuck. So clearly my sisters had at least as weird experiences I did. But they never said anything either. And he‚Äôs a cop! So every parent was fine with us going over there. 

So I don‚Äôt know - maybe worse happened and I‚Äôve buried it. I‚Äôve never had flashbacks. But I‚Äôve never reported this either and I don‚Äôt know how or if I could. What if some other kid reported him but nobody else did so they‚Äôre not believed?"
BipolarReddit,fgevg52,t3_ey1qzg,1580711516.0,"I think you have to accept responsibility. With caveats. It was you.

So you did it but you were in a scary and intense mental state and you were not as aware of the impacts of your actions. You and your partner will need to read a lot about the condition. You will need to really commit to helping yourself, forever. Going to therapy taking your meds and not using it as an excuse. But it sounds like you are doing all this, and that‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôm new to this too! If you can show your partner some solid steps you‚Äôve put in place to work on this, hopefully she can see that you are making changes. Money is hard, b a lot of people on here have good plans on how to stop themselves blowing money fast, such as leaving their cards at home or with a partner or trusted family member.

AntiVaxxers,fgev6z5,t1_fgetj7e,1580711238.0,"‚Äî- Can you not get autism from an outside source? Source please?

‚ÄúAutism is not an illness

Being autistic does not mean you have an illness or disease. It means your brain works in a different way from other people.

It's something you're born with or first appears when you're very young.

If you're autistic, you're autistic your whole life.

Autism is not a medical condition with treatments or a ""cure"". But some people need support to help them with certain things.‚Äù

Source - NHS.uk

‚ÄúWhat is the main cause of autism?
There is no known single cause for autism spectrum disorder, but it is generally accepted that it is caused by abnormalities in brain structure or function. Brain scans show differences in the shape and structure of the brain in children with autism compared to in neurotypical children.‚Äù
Source - autism society.org

The general science so far fis that there are genetic factors leading to a vulnerability of a child developing autism. There is no conclusive science to say any outside factors influence the child, once their genetic material is final (embryo) and while there is researching looking into illness in pregnancy affecting autism, it is not at a point to have a definitive finding yet. 

‚Äî‚Äî But they are using the word in the same context, so I con't see how it becomes ablest just because a non-scientist is using it

I consider an academic paper in a pay walled journal to be a different context to an image a non scientist posts on facebook. The context is the medium, the readers, the peer review and the educations. 

‚Äî‚Äî Then why isn't it irresponsible when scientists use it? And even if it will be misinterpreted, how is that ablest?

Because scientists are speaking within their context. Even within different disciplines of study, words have different meaning. If a chemist is talking about volume, he is not talking about how loud something is. The word regress has different meanings to the general public. 

‚Äî- Can you clarify how you think misinterpretation of the meaning of ""regress"" leads to ableism?

Because to regress needs a point to start at - non autistic child - and a point to regress to - autistic child. Stating this clearly implies a value difference. You do not regress to a better place. You regress to dementia, to infancy, the word means going backwards. Culturally, backwards is negative. So this is implying autistic is negative. 


Nobody would be making these images and sharing their fear mongering if they thought autism was okay. They‚Äôre afraid of what they don‚Äôt know and in doing so they‚Äôre causing more suffering to people who can already be struggling. Sure they‚Äôre not responsible for all of the ableism, but they are contributing. How would the mother of an autistic child or anyone with autism feel seeing this image?"

It makes it sound like it‚Äôs caused by an external factor, and if that factor had not happened, the child would never display signs of autism. And that is not how autism works. 

Sure, the scientists can use the word regress, but most people aren‚Äôt scientists, they‚Äôre mums in Facebook and using the scientific words without reading the whole article (cos they don‚Äôt have access to the medical journals) or reading it without understanding what it really means, is dangerous. Other people will start making inferences like ‚Äúoh my kid has regressed into autism since I changed his diet/school/essential oil diffuser/vaccine regime‚Äù. And that is not how autism works. 

I think it is irresponsible language because of how other people interpret it. But of course it‚Äôs just because the people who made this image, don‚Äôt understand.

- confidentially speak with hr and your boss. Explain that you had a strong reaction to a negative experience at work. See if they think it was a big deal, or us everyone forgotten about it already. They may know how the other people involved feel about it too. If everyone else thinks it wasn‚Äôt big and they‚Äôve forgotten - that means that (logically) you can try to put it behind you. Talk with your therapist about how to get past anxiety of past events repeating. 
- if they think it is a big deal, or you think work is not safe or you cannot cope with being there, then decide what you need to do next to think about looking for another job.

bipolar2,fg62l9t,t3_ex204w,1580550316.0,"I started reading a lot about bipolar and borderline before I saw my new psychiatrist. I had known I had depression and anxiety for 16 yrs, but lately that didn‚Äôt seem to be all that my symptoms were. I felt like I had something more. I was nervous it was borderline. I went to see a new psychiatrist and he said he believed it was bipolar 2, with a lot of borderline traits. The next appt he said it is also adhd. 

I honestly felt huge relief firstly. Because if it was just depression and anxiety, then I felt like there was no hope. I could not face it if I had exhausted all ways of helping myself. To get something new meant I could start learning new things and I love to launch myself at a new project. So I bought books and came on reddit and started new meds. As I read more in bipolar I realised it does actually fit me a lot. Adhd has been the same thing. I think because I already knew I had something, it wasn‚Äôt so frightening to get a diagnosis as maybe it might be for someone who never thought of themselves as mentally ill. 

I certainly don‚Äôt feel like I have all the answers or can control myself perfectly, but I have hope. I could get help, and I might be able to do some things I had decided I never could. So it‚Äôs been good. Today I attended my first in person bipolar peer-led support group and it was cool. I felt listened to and not judged and like it was a safe space."

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs been a problem with the two meds, but other people may have issues, perhaps if they needed to take something to bring them down at the same time as they needed to work or study and need adhd meds. I was worried that my dex would trigger hypomania but that hasn‚Äôt happened so far."

But from what I‚Äôve seen, martingale collars can be quite bulky and you may not want to leave them on full time. However it‚Äôs safest to always have tags on your doggy in case something happens and then are lost or escaped. So a small thin collar that has a ring for tags is like the in-between option. 

For us also, our two girls look quite similar and in the moment we want to know which name to call, or if the wrong doggy has its head in a good bowl. So having two dif collars is helpful. However, I did just remember my partner is slightly colourblind and maybe I should have just made them in one colour each!!! Oooops!!!! But we shall see how this goes for now."

bulletjournal,fg5anbm,t3_ewvc9f,1580522520.0,"I‚Äôve got three different places to track at the end of each day, I can‚Äôt work out a way to keep them all on one page cos I have too much data. One is a sheet for the whole month, with my meds, my mania/depression scale, sleep, anxiety, and a very small bit for notes on the day. Another is a page for each day that is my social rhythm so it‚Äôs what time I do everything that day - get up, eat, work, talk to someone in person - and who it‚Äôs with and how stimulating it is. Last more detailed notes, so what happened that made me feel high or low (or when I was feeling high or low, what happened... not sure which comes first yet!), what I think could be side effects, and how well I ate. 

Getting diagnosed recently and then learning to track these things to get a handle on my mental health, is what made me look at bullet journaling. I feel a bit grim when I see people being excited about new habits like yoga or running or class assignments, while I‚Äôm counting my antipsychotic medications and working out what was a delusion or not. BUT I know we are all different and on different paths at dif parts of our lives and I should not judge them or myself. It‚Äôs just a bit jarring sometimes. I hope one day I can track those more fun things too."

ADHD,fg3bjii,t3_ewo9rm,1580477078.0,"I do this for a few minutes a day, as a way to unwind and try to calm myself. But I don‚Äôt really have involved daydreams. There is a behaviour called Maladaptive Daydreaming, that isn‚Äôt a recognised disorder but is accepted as a behaviour. It‚Äôs maladaptive if it‚Äôs disrupting your regular function - causing you to miss school or work or responsibilities. I‚Äôve listened to interviews (podcasts) where people have talked about how much time they spent daily escaping to their daydream worlds. It seems to coincide with adhd and depression and anxiety. 

Not saying you have it, but it is a thing. To me it seems like an avoidant behaviour as a way to cope, so totally valid way of coping, but if it‚Äôs affecting your regular function then maybe mention it to your doctor or therapist."
