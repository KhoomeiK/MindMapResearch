Drugs,fqxmpb1,t3_glgxym,1589734680.0,Yeah people think I'm weird when I say I miss that old brick weed but I can't handle these new high THC strains that everyone sells. Too much anxiety when I get super high off of just a hit or two. Unfortunately in my small town there are only a few legal shops and they only carry the highest THC stuff because that's what sells. Sometimes I'll find some people that grow weak weed but it's rare. I'd grow it myself but I'm not allowed to in my rental home.

It is the hardest drug out there IMO because you don't black out on most other drugs and do dumb shit and it's also easy to overdose on if you're drinking a lot.

Hangovers are so bad now in my 30s that even if I drink a few beers I can't function the next day. I am glad I have quit but sometimes I screw up and then I regret it and don't do it again for a long time. Eventually I'll learn my lesson.

I mean, that is still worth it if you really want to play it but to me it would be better to get it when the whole game is out so I don't have to wait between episodes."
PS4,fpsi370,t1_fpshj3b,1588873843.0,"Well, I agree with you in some ways but in other ways I want the full game to come out before I buy it because you know they're going to release a full collection at some point.
