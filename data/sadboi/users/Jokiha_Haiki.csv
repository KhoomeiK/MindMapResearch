mentalillness,f6zzjfq,t3_dtx2rf,1573322658.0,"Holy fucking shit fuck off. You're gonna give him some mental illnesses and he's going to be on this sub for a reason really soon if you don't change your attitude. You have no idea what you are doing to him. Rejecting him for something that is unchangeable and a part of him as his parents which are supposed to be his source of unconditional love is pure torture and something that will make him spiral down into depression, self-harm, abandonment issues... Please stop this and just love him."

schizophrenia,f6x3nqa,t1_f6x3drs,1573241203.0,"Sorry uhhh... Drums! I literally just created a word thinking it was transparent. Well when it comes to instumental I really like dubstep, electronic or chill stuff, LoFi does it pretty well or stuff like In Love with a Ghost. Also video games and film OST's. Music that tells stories or make you feel weird.
I really like lyrics tho, I guess some of them have a meaning I can either really relate too or that I just like the concept of the story told, either that or the singer's voice is straight up gorgeous."
schizophrenia,f6x2xdr,t1_f6x20a5,1573240722.0,"I honestly really wish I continued playing the violin or got into batteries. I love batteries and I used to play the violin but I don't have the patience nor the motivation, everything just makes me sad.

Lately I haven't changed much genres... But I'm into 70's type of rock like Pink Floyd, some vaporwave, sad and weird stuff like Tally Hall or Temporex, and electro swing or future funk and disco if I'm in the mood.

What about you ?"
