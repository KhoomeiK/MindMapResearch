That's my only issue with posts like these. OP might be making a good point, but looking thin (rather than actually have a good diet which is still healthy) is always the marker, and a bunch of people (who may have extra pounds but are not obese) get lumped into the same group. 

That's why groups that promote not hating your body are so popular. No one approaches the topic in a kind or informative way. I've seen hundreds of fat shaming comments on pictures on Reddit alone hating on people who aren't even close to being obese. Being obsessed with thin bodies isn't healthy either."

demisexuality,fkcw0d3,t1_fkcte33,1584062442.0,Not liking porn does not automatically make someone insecure and not confident. It is completely valid to not like it the same way it is valid that some people do.
demisexuality,fkcvllj,t3_fhmaas,1584062173.0,"Edit: OP forgot he was using his porn account so this entire post is just ironic and disrespectful. Please ignore anything I said about a ""healthy balance"", this cleary does not exist.

First of all, completely normal. I'm the demi in my relationship and I feel that exact same way. Sometimes I tried to fight it, but mostly, there has to be some sort of peace that your girlfriend finds within herself. Don't be disrespectful if you are both out and about (starring, ignoring your girlfriend to look at another woman). 

With regards to porn, describing it as a ""primal itch"" is gross. No one is a slave to their urges. They should not control you. Porn (in my opinion) is not necessary, and if it causes a point of tension in your relationship, you should consider whether porn is worth more to you than your girlfriend. She has every right to ask you to stop (the fact that she thinks she ""knows she could never stop you"" is alarming) but you have every right to say no. I say this as someone who grew up being taught that men are all sex-crazed and if they don't get their porn, they get angry. Then I learned porn addictions exist in the worst way possible. Point is, no one has to tolerate anything they're uncomfortable with. My personal take on this is that it is absolutely possible to cut porn out (maybe talk to you girlfriend about this if you want to consider it, and she can help support you with it). If you are both able to strike a healthy balance with it, know that it takes respect on both sides. 

So, reassure her that you love her, be respectful of her feelings and know that it's not simply upto her to ""deal"" with your behaviour, she has to make her peace with aspects of herself (that betrayal feeling may not always go away but that doesn't mean you don't have feelings for her) but maybe you should be more mindful of the way you interact with the women around you, as well as porn. These topics need to come up in conversations between you two if you want to continue to have a healthy relationship. It can be uncomfortable, of course, but you will both be stronger for it."
