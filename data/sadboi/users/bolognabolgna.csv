90DayFiance,evzy4qg,t3_clwhsf,1564970403.0,"Both families are disrespectful and immature. Pedro’s sister is rude AF, his mom is rude AF and Pedro can’t see why his relationship with his family causes tension. If your wife has an issue with you sending them money then compromise on sending less. Yes, how loving of him how he wants to help his mom and sister but he and chantel are building their life together and need to save for themselves. It doesn’t look like they’re rolling in money.     And chantels family has their noses in the air thinking they’re somehow better. River has a chip on his shoulder for no freakin reason at all, her dad is hella passive and doesn’t try to get his wife or kids to chill the hell out. Chantel needs to leave her family out of their relationship and learn how to find facts out before she calls anyone out or goes believing anyone. There’s a right way and a wrong way to question someone about some bullshit you heard from a sketchy source at best.  She isn’t the first person to not like their husbands family, I don’t like my mother in law at all, she needs to learn how to either be civil and just keep the conversation surface level and swallow her pride a little man. Like you aren’t always going to get someone to say they’re wrong, but frankly everyone is guilty in my opinion, but you can’t clutch that so tight and let it become something you just beat to death to the point where yes it’s gonna end your marriage.     This family gets me hella heated lol"
BPD,evzjfao,t3_clw1qy,1564959164.0,"I used that exact description to my psychiatrist lol Then I regretted it when he took it in a CIA and tinfoil hat way.  But yes, I do feel like that a lot"

BPD,evvgk93,t1_euuwd8u,1564836072.0,"I see a psychiatrist and a therapist. I’ve told my family and my husband that I can’t handle being a mom and that I am toxic for my kids to be around, especially now. I know my actions are reckless and effecting more than just me. However it wasn’t until recently that I’ve been able to get the help I need and I do think that it’s one of those things where it makes me question if it’s too late to not have a bigger self intervention. I don’t know. I did talk to my counselor even though I was nervous to and I talked my psychiatrist also."

selfharm,euuil8l,t1_etuzenh,1564045054.0,I used to journal a lot too until it was found and read. It sucks when something that can be a positive in a way gets turned into a negative
BPD,euuie0s,t1_etz9yif,1564044946.0,It was a year and half lol He never got the hint and it made me even more angry. I do need to realize almost that he’s gonna do what he does in a sense but i have to work on being better
BPD,euui59f,t3_chj0fo,1564044763.0,"I think this more so when I see pictures of other people and their friends. I like to socialize but it’s really hard, especially now. I always say that every person we encounter teaches us something. Sometimes the only painful memories of a person come up first but I try to always pick one good memory.    Sometimes the memory is as simple as the way they smelt or I enjoyed their smile lol But it’s something. Don’t get lost in the what if’s. Look for something to put energy into that isn’t a person. Maybe a dog? Cat? Ferret? Or maybe a project?  I have always had the same thoughts on not living long, had a panic attack at 21,25 and now I’m 27 and the idea of turning 30 terrifies me on a different level lol 30 can be the start to so many things for you! Maybe it’s the decade you discover a new layer to yourself. Think positive! I have an entire Pinterest board of images that spark a fragment of joy inside myself. Maybe you can spend your 30s taking pictures of things that make you happy or were interesting to you so you can look back and think of all the neat things you’ve seen."
BPD,euugti5,t3_chkj42,1564043924.0,I’m a Christian and even believing in a life after death I still have these moments of dread. More of a “what’s the point “ kinda thing. I have to distract myself from those thoughts because they really are a black hole. I call myself an old lady because I will craft to distract myself lol Or color. Anything to divert my attention
BPD,euueh4o,t3_ch8umt,1564042706.0,Just told my 16 year old brother this lol He was asking about my mental health stuff and I said “I’m basically a juvenile”
morbid_reality,euqt76z,t3_c5gc77,1563984919.0,"I wish more people would feel safe enough to put their babies in safe places if they can’t care for them. Heartbreaking. I haven’t followed the story but I hope baby is ok and that whoever the mom is made sure she was ok as well. It makes me extremely nervous to think of a woman in any state of mind to put their baby in a bag wandering about. Hopefully the woman is seeking the help for her body and mind,"
morbid_reality,euqse7m,t1_esuou19,1563984563.0,Disagree. It’s legal now and the frequency of people still doing this just shows that it hardly makes a difference. There are multiple places they could have safely dropped off their baby.
BPD,eug87iw,t3_cg3ofm,1563802400.0,"I have 4 children and was just diagnosed less than a year ago. I have had a bad time with being a mother and can see a lot of negatives. I will say however if I had gotten help earlier and not been stubborn, it would have been easier to manage. There’s nothing wrong with not having kids and I find myself wishing I never did a lot. BUT there’s nothing wrong with having them either as long as you’re mindful and make sure you take the steps to keep yourself healthy. 3 of my kids already have red flags and it makes me feel like shit."

CatAdvice,esldt1v,t3_c894jm,1562083893.0,"When I had two cats they wouldn’t ride in the carrier. The one rode on my lap and the other would sit and look out the window. They wouldn’t ever run when we got into the office, I wrapped a blanket around them both. They were chill. You can also do two carriers though, which is really what I would recommend"
