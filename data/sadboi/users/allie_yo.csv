college,f5smf23,t3_dp377x,1572436625.0,"hey, i‚Äôm a fine arts major but i‚Äôm getting my associates at a state university. 
pros of being an art major:
 ‚Ä¢your core classes are all related to art, obviously. this means not as much written work and more hands on learning as opposed to a typical academic setting. 
‚Ä¢you will get taught the fundamentals pretty much instantaneously.  correct technique and methods are highly emphasized. you truly are taught to be an artist. 
cons:
 ‚Ä¢for me specifically, the workload is taxing. i have homework every week for about 4 different art classes. 
‚Ä¢classes are longer. since you do studio classes, you need more time to work. having a 6 hour drawing class isn‚Äôt uncommon. (mine is spread out between two days, 3 hours apiece)
‚Ä¢kind of expensive- my school has a very low budget so we all had to pay for art supplies out of pocket. i ended up dropping $400+ on supplies. this may not be the case for where you go, though. 
my advice is this:
if you‚Äôre truly passionate about art, i would do an associates and give it a shot. see if it‚Äôs really what you wanna do. then pursue it fully. 
there are ways to incorporate art into career choices, despite what people may say. 
on the other hand, if you want to pursue a career in social work, make sure you have a passion for psychology because that‚Äôll be a huge focus! 
it took me a while to finally settle on being a fine arts major, but i enjoy it now. it‚Äôs fulfilling."

trashy,euh1npt,t3_cgeaib,1563819177.0,"Okay so this isn‚Äôt really the whole story. I live in PA and this was on my local news bc the school is actually near where i live. Essentially there was a ton of kids who weren‚Äôt paying for lunch and the school was about $22k down from all the people who weren‚Äôt paying. Some kids were even $400 in the hole. A school official had sent out multiple letters to some of these parents, and even though it wasn‚Äôt the best thing to add, the letter had alluded to the fact that not being able to pay these dues could result in your child being put in foster care. It wasn‚Äôt a threat, just an example of extreme action that could be taken, especially because it was an incident that occurred multiple times. (Once again, it‚Äôs not that it was right, it just requires context.) I also understand people saying that maybe people couldn‚Äôt afford it, but there are literally programs where your income can get you free lunch so i‚Äôm just assuming the people who weren‚Äôt paying just kept forgetting to bring money or were taking advantage of being able to charge. A little different than pulling kids from their parents lmao"
