wow,fqxk14a,t1_fqx84o4,1589733491.0,"Very well said and I think you hit the nail on the head of the feeling I couldn’t really put into words. I’d love to casually have access to M+ and even normal raids if I can find uninterrupted hours on an evening my kids actually stay in bed and my wife doesn’t need my attention lol. 

But at this point I’m flat out not going to grind for essences, if I go I’m gonna run in with whatever corruptions and Azerite traits I just happen to already have. So that’s putting a huge damper on my ability to provide a meaningful contribution to the raid. And if everyone in the raid goes with this approach (tbh I’m not really sure here in terms of scaling, but going off past experience with casual raiding) even normal modes will likely be challenging because no ones got the correct essences or corruptions to carry the team. 

That being said, I’ve got a few guildies that are geared to the teeth (rank 15 cloaks, max essences, good corruptions etc) that have offered a backpack ride through some mythics, so I’ve won a bit of a lottery there! I only just joined a week ago and it’s a group of total strangers, so we’ll see how it goes. 

But still my approach is only going to be chasing ilvl upgrades and practicing my tanking in case I can viably raid shadowlands with a casual play schedule (5-10 hours/week) once work picks back up again."

If you disagree that’s fine, I’m not here to debate how much free time used up can be considered too much etc... 

There is absolutely no arguing tho, that this game has a metric fuckton more to do every week than it did 10 years ago. I just don’t get the “there’s nothing left to do so I’m bored argument”"

That doesn’t change the fact that this is not true for a lot of other players. I came back just over a month ago (early April, last I played was the first two weeks of legion) and since then I have unlocked flying and two allied races while barely gearing up my main (430, just finished the horrific visions quest chain). 

And I have been playing an unreasonable amount daily due to quarantine. And I haven’t even gotten into a single M+ or lfr/raid, or really learned the entire game system going into horrific visions. I thought it was just gonna be a fun mini game that you hop into once a week, only to realize there’s an entire upgrade tree involved. 

I am completely overwhelmed with the amount in front of me to do, to the point where I’m just gonna probably not. Grinding to unlock the bis essences and learning wtf corruptions are actually good just sounds like a pain in the ass... mostly because I can’t get the essences due to being locked behind raids or pvp (as a primarily solo player, both of these are a pipe dream... I also never really GOT pvp). 

I no lifed wow back when wintergrasp was cool. Alts were possible because once I finished my main raiding both 10 man and 25 man ToC(?) and ICC for the week, maybe the occasional heroic for badges..., and then he was done and it was on to gearing up or leveling up the alts. 

Maybe raids took longer back then (haven’t done any since MoP outside of LFR), but I was putting in a solid 60 hours a week and never ran out of stuff to do (in what was at the time, the longest content drought wow had seen) 

Sorry, this comment was an entirely selfish walk back through time for me, recounting the good old days. Maybe I’m jealous that I don’t have the free time any more to play the way I used to and WISH I could play enough to get bored with it? I don’t really know, but thanks for inspiring an absolutely awful comment. I think I need a therapist lmao. 

TLDR: if you’re tired of it, go play something else for a while? For those who are new or wish they could play enough to be bored with it, the amount to do each week in game currently is overwhelming. I’m personally looking forward to shadowkeep because somewhere I heard a clip from Ion where he said you may finish for the week on your main AND THATS OKAY."

Don’t do world quests yet. Instead start the quest to go to Nazjatar (send the fleet?) and there you will do a short quest chain for a 370 weapon and armor piece which is a huge boost. 

Once you finish that, you will get a quest to go to heart of Azeroth from Magni and this small chain boosts your neck to level 50 (ilvl 430ish). 


Once you’ve done all that then it’s just doing world quests for gear to shore up low pieces and some dungeons I guess? This is where I am currently, but I decided to hop over and level a stable of alts for now."

But the advice for highmountain specifically is much appreciated!"
wow,fnxioy2,t1_fnx2xhc,1587339445.0,"Thanks for that! As a new player with no “main” who’s been 120 for a while it’s hard because all these guides are for fresh 120’s tend to focus hard on alts and sending things over from the main etc. 

So uhhhh where can I pick up this alleged death of chromie and can I do it at 302 ilevel? :)"
wownoob,fntybsv,t1_fntw6vh,1587250937.0,"Thanks. I think the disconnect is everyone of these vids assumed the Naz quest just pops up... but it doesn’t. You apparently have to hit friendly with all three leveling zone factions. 

With the xp boost and two heirlooms (20%) i dinged 120 just before I finished drustvar campaign. 

So now I have a few hours of wasted quest grinds at a stupid scaling level (seriously, 119 I could pull a 5 pack of mobs and aoe them down as Ret super easy, at 120 3 mobs is pushing it and I’m spamming heals and cooldowns.) to do before I can unlock Naz

Edit:
I think my new plan is just jump to an alt and grind another one up to 120 (this time bouncing as soon as I hit friendly) until next week when the rep boost hits."
wownoob,fntqi4f,t1_fnteeb6,1587246818.0,This. I was scouring for about 45 minutes trying to figure out how to get to naz. I went 110-120 before finishing just drustvar. Looks like I got some more grinding to do and a better plan for my alts (get friendly/hop islands).

wownoob,fnooitr,t1_fno0tvl,1587130319.0,Sounds like the person you bumped into doesn’t know how to do it and just had several games running and the characters auto following each other. A real multiboxer wouldn’t have slowed you down much because they’d all be casting the same spells etc and downing mobs pretty quick.
wow,fnkuwcm,t1_fnkmx7w,1587040584.0,Same. Except two days ago. Haven’t played since legion launch. Resubbed and got bfa. Grinding my mains to 120 quick but I’d love the chance to do more.

But I totally get the rage when some doof walks in without even health boost and insta carts. 

Have you tried our lord and rando-savior SnS support? It literally saves lives."
MonsterHunterMeta,fmuv1b5,t3_fxhdpa,1586399512.0,"Anecdotal at best but my first runs of safi (as an SnS main) I went in before the raths (MR 40-50’s?), was 3 pc teostra, Garuga legs and I think Kirin chest. 

Just added in part breaker where I could. Definitely keep health boost 3 and max out the armor defense as best you can. But do NOT use def boost as a skill. It’s a total waste. 

Will you cart occasionally? Yes. Everyone does. I went in with a group all in the 200+ MR one time and we used 3/4 carts because of bad luck lol. (Btw always eat for feline insurance or the new safeguard skill!)

Edit: the best weapon I had was the pink rathian one before gold. It wasn’t awesome, but poison is super helpful and it’s not a bad weapon at all. Brachy one is way better... but that’s why you’re doing safi... the weapons."

WaterdeepDragonHeist,fmb7k4w,t3_ftztmt,1585920360.0,"I am still a relatively inexperienced DM so take this worth a grain of salt, but my group just did our second session of chapter 2 last night via zoom. 

Our first in ch2 session had 0 combat and was centered around the haunting of the manor which was awesome. The party grouped up around a light spell for their first night stay, heard a banging upstairs and they were too scared to not go as a full party, then upon coming back down all their stuff was neatly folded and packed up by the door dropping a serious GTFO! Hint. More haunting throughout the night and exploration of the manor, really required the manor map, so I would 100% use it. 

Last night involved one of the faction missions and the entrance of a new party member, and just using the screen share option through zoom to show where locations were in waterdeep was enough to get the job done. 

I hope to find a solid crash course in Roll20 before I’m confident enough to use it for our next session. I’m hoping to use it only as a battlemat tho, and not an exhaustive platform. 

Tldr: maps are helpful, especially trollskull manor and alley and waterdeep at large. Did not need player tokens for combat stuffs, theater of the mind works perfectly for the limited possible combats as written, can’t speak for DMs guild modules."

guitarpedals,fltvc6n,t3_fr5izv,1585488338.0,"Signal chain:

AC booster plus. This thing was the cornerstone of my rig through my classic 50. The preamp side (ch A) has a low end and mid boost that takes any thin brittle/thin tones out of my strat, and makes it sound great. Not sure if I love it into the iridium. 

Keeley Aria- I bought this primarily for the compressor+ and really should have left it at that. Can’t find a drive sound I like, but the compressor is full of chewy goodness. 

BD-2. Blues driver needs no introduction. It’s my rhythm tone when I need some extra crunch on top of the AC. 

VP Junior (JHS mod). For swells into the mod section of my rig. Love the positioning and the interaction of the gain stages into the reverb/delay as controlled by the volume pedal. (TPS did over an hour episode on volume pedals, this position works best for me so far). 

HX effects -> iridium. 

The HX effects was previously my mod section: chorus, trem, reverbs, delays etc.  but I’ve started to play with the drives and some of them are totally kickass even compared to the analog ones on my board.

Iridium. Hot damn this pedal! I never ever in a thousand years thought I’d give up my tube amp but this thing sounds so good and responsive. Using it currently as a practice rig at home and I can’t find a sound I don’t like. I may try it in my live rig after this whole COVID-19 thing runs its course. I play for a church with my mic’d amp behind a wall backstage, with iem’s for monitors and using the iems at home I prefer the iridium’s sounds better. 

First world problems: I can’t settle on one tone from this thing to run everything off of! I can’t even settle on just one rhythm tone and one lead tone. The fender amp is home to me, but that AC chimey crunch is unreal! 

The other problem I’m having is wanting to run it in the effects loop of the HX to put the delays and verbs after it (it doesn’t have its own FXloop and running a bit of drive through it after the delays muddies things up too much for my ears). I totally CAN run it like this but the HX effects has no headphones out. I literally facepalmed so hard when I set this up at home and to my dismay I was only hearing the dry side. 

Any advice on running to headphones on the 1/4” out from the HX? 


Tldr: there’s not really a way to do this and give it justice. I’m incredibly impressed with the warmth of the tones in iridium and how amp-like it is through headphones. It just sounds great without having to play with dozens of tweakable presets. Great for quarantine in a small apartment, will see if it translates to my live rig after the virus. 

9/10. Would be 10/10 if it had its own effects loop between the amp and cab sides."

LMoP was a great first campaign as a DM for me... just running DH now with a different and smaller party and it’s been awesome! Just had our first foray into chapter two, which was a lot of prep because it’s sandbox, but then as to be expected, they avoided the areas I prepped almost entirely so 90% wound up being improv. 

And then I gave them the wrong faction quest description because in the moment the pages got mixed up for me lol. 

Still been a ton of fun and we haven’t gotten into the real meat portion that starts in chapter 3."
