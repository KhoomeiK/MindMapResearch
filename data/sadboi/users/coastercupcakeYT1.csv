I think it's because as you age, you tend to not want to try stuff. For instance, I took forever to get my dad to try skiing in his forties, and even though he loves it now and is damn good, he's always saying how ""I'd try those big jumps if I was 20 years younger."" Similarly, trying out new music is rife at the ages you described. Some people have mentioned that music becomes less important as you age - I disagree, I just think it becomes harder to discover.

I think people my age find it really easy to connect with lyrics because artists direct their content towards people that are in despair - whether a false sense or not - or just want to feel sad."

Compare and contrast with a recent development, I.e Scientific Revolution was different from the French Revolution in that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ but similar in that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.*
