AmItheAsshole,fr2o8i1,t1_fr10sud,1589840786.0,"It might not be cancer, it's entirely possible it's just a malfunctioning thyroid.  If it's just hypothyroidism (underactice thyroid) you get prescribed levothyroxine (Synthroid) which is a Thyroid hormone replacement.

If it's cancer, things are more complicated.   They will want to remove part or all of your thyroid.   Because of this, you will need to take levothyroxine the rest of your life.  The cancer treatment isn't like other cancers. It's radioactive Iodine.  The only cells in our body that use iodine are the Thyroid and Saliva glands.   So, for 10 days you would need to go on a low or no iodine diet.  It's fairly strict and you can look it up.   You'd be suprised what all has iodine in it.   The next day you go and take a dose, a pill, containing radioactive iodine.   It makes you dizzy and nauseated.   After that you can't be around any living thing for a week or two, depending on the dosage.   People have to stay so many feet away from you.   The excess iodine will come out in sweat, among other ways.   So, anything you touch needs to be cleaned before someone else touches it.   Things you use during this period should be cleaned or thrown away.   It's not fun, but a heck of a lot better than chemo.    After the time period they will have you go lay in a machine that is able to check for the radioactive iodine left in your body...   That way they can tell if any cancer is left and moved from the neck.   (they did this with a small dose of some other iodine before treatment)

So...   All in all its a ton of doctors appointments, 10 days of the worst diet ever, and 2 weeks of solitary confinement (After quarantine that's not so bad).  

They say that if you're going to get cancer Thyroid is the ""easiest"" to deal with.   I think it has much longer lasting effects."

I'm not totally straight, but I don't call myself bi either since I won't date a woman.   I consider myself ""heteroflexible"".   There's more to sexuality than who you want in your bed, just like there's more to gender than what's in your pants."

needadvice,fmdxsz4,t3_fulab6,1585981565.0,"How much do you notice other people's nervousness? What does it make you think of them if you notice it?

When I started talking about mental illness with people in my life I learned how many of them struggled with the same things I did.   I realized that many more people dealt with things like anxiety than I thought.   I also realized how little people pay attention to others and when they do how most people thought similarly to how I did.   They found the anxiety or nervousness to be endearing or didn't mind.   They were fine waiting it out or were understanding of it because EVERYONE has experienced it at some point in their lives, even if they don't have an anxiety disorder."

It made a huge difference for me and has continued to even though I stopped the practice.  I no longer get into the states I used to.
Sunnyvale,fm1h02w,t1_fm1eaqc,1585678254.0,"This person is pointing something valid out:  How are we supposed to get necessities like groceries?  

Most stores have pickup for groceries that you purchase through them, and many will bring them out to you right now.   That's not mingling.   Sadly, there's the fact that some of us are on tight budgets and need to be able to take advantage of the sales stores offer, not the higher delivery service pricing.   Not everyone has the option to avoid things like the grocery store or the pharmacy.  I'm not saying they should go out willy nilly, but use caution and best judgement in the matter."

My suggestion : use the tools you have available.   You can connect to a worldwide network of other performers in the same headspace you are.   They don't have to be the music family you already have, but ones to support you (and you them) during this time when everyone needs all the help we can get.   Use reddit or other sites to find quarantine friends, Skype or w/e to have a jam session.   Bring joy into the world together with a temporary music family.

They aren't saying BPD is the female form of psychopathy.  They are making distinct note that they are two seperate diagnosises throughout that study, but believe that it's more likely women develop that particular comorbidity.  Also, FYI, they used inmates at a maximum security prision."
