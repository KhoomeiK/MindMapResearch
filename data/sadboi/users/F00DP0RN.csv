ak47,fr526ss,t3_gmqane,1589901176.0,"\[request for information\] Looking for Arsenal SLR 106 ZenitCo compatible rail that fits and what tools are required to fit one. Currently, I'm running a stock lower hand guard, however I want a ZenitCo lower rail, has anyone bought one of these and successfully added it to there rifle?  


 **Ivan Tactical's website states:** Basic out of the box compatible models:  Arsenal SLR 104,106,107 . These are compatible with **STAMPED** AK receivers \[Arsenal\] Fitting milled receiver is possible, but will require filing hand-guard. When you file down hand-guards, you should check if the fit is tight. Hand-guard should fit VERY tight, otherwise you can get wobbles after a few hundreds shots."

Let’s be clear, Democrats also took part in standing some of these facilities up years ago, and even Obama increased them. People even applauded him when he said we had to reinforce these facilities. Why is it now that you think their bad? Did you question them then? They existed, surely they were their, as that part never changed. But only now your political party says “cage bad” and you are questioning it’s existence? Do you actually think their bad, or are you being programmed by your political party to think their bad, only now that their public stance is fighting “cages” and want to give socialized medicine to illegal immigrates? 

I vote Democrat. I did not vote for trump. I voted for Bernie, so don’t get me twisted. However, I am conservative, my perfect candidate would be JFK, I wish more democrats would move that way instead of where the party is going now. 

Anyways, I want you to ask your self this right now, if the media told you that vaping was worst then smoking would you actually believe it? They tried to say that (not saying that the smoking industry was defaulting on their billion dollar loans from 1991 and this was a tactic was to scare people away from vaping and back to cigarettes) but they forgot that only boomers trust the media and government so it’s not working..."
