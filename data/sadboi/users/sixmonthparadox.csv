Borderlands,fh6qdse,t1_fh6pta1,1581303530.0,"i genuinely thought that the lack of story added to the overall atmosphere. Also, because there was LESS comedy, the few times jokes were cracked they hit harder and were a lot funnier. Like, the game opens up, it's all pretty serious and low-key intense, and then you fight nine-toes, and are informed that he has three balls. 

fucking. hilarious."
Borderlands,fh6pkb8,t1_fh663lm,1581302968.0,"you know how the soulsborne series just kinda drops you in, gives you a little back story but otherwise doesn't **really** tell you anything about what's going on? 

Borderlands 1 was equally magical in its enigmatic presentation, and I will always prefer it simply for the desire it instilled in me as a teenager to EXPLORE because I had absolutely no clue as to what the fuck I was doing or why I was doing it. 

BL2 and BL3 are all flashy and there's long, drawn out tutorials, everything is explained and your hand is held practically the entire game and I really think it detracts from what Pandora is really all about."

Overwatch,fcywwxp,t3_ej0foy,1578088874.0,"learn all the characters and their movesets, then focus on getting ONE SINGLE ROLE to diamond. Learn one role, lightly play the other two while you learn but make sure to find 2 or 3 tanks for example to play until you have a diamond understanding of the game minimum. i think tank or healer would be best plus the queues are shorter and if you get good you will climb simply by being a better healer or tank. ALSO in order to be good at comp, you have to play a LOT of comp. it's unfortunate that quick play isnt taken more seriously but this is how it is. also ALSO, main tanks are at such a deficiency right now i win an easy 3 out of 10 games simply for playing main tank while the enemy team doesn't have one and that's in masters."

depression,fcr8tul,t1_fcr512k,1577898450.0,"EXACTLY! We're superhumans emotionally, and when we realize that, we start to flourish."
depression,fcr1anl,t3_eih6s6,1577895304.0,"happy new years man. i can tell there is an insane amount of empathy and a story behind the way you worded this, so i'd like to say something too.

if you're alone, like me, just remember that with this depth of feeling comes great emotional power, and we are capable of some truly great things. if you're surrounded by people, but still alone, just remember that while you may only be a single human not intertwined with any other, your universe still revolves entirely around you.
in this context, i like to think of my universe as a dot that i literally can connect to other dots with a line and merge them almost so completely that it is now two identical dots occupying the same space. by the way, the sex is fucking insane too when it happens in a literal sense and the two dots actually DO occupy the same space while you're tapped into this deep appreciation and empathy

but i digress LOL

as soon as you embrace that as a source of strength, you will find a deep meaning in sharing your wisdom with people who you come to care for and an appreciation for your own life that will make the pain a little more bearable and your time here a lot less short. 

i'm here going through this too, you know? in every way you are. 'happiness only real when shared.' share the insanely difficult things with your loved ones ands friends and coworkers in ways that are beneficial to them. find the time to write down what you've gone through and take note of the depth of your emotion. find a way to get it out of you and validate it with the rest of existence so you have something concrete to work on and build from. 

i look at this as a superpower and have had moments of emotional clarity where i was able to detach from my emotions and analyze the pain and suicidal thoughts and the traumas that resurface from outside of the box they were coming from and i realized:

it's only physical: it's literally just your body fighting against you. while it feels like it naturally stems from some external stimuli, nine times out of ten it did not. it very likely may be that your brain and soul want to react completely differently than you do emotionally. bear in mind, i've had depression that i can remember since i was eight years old, and this has worked wonders for me in dealing with it. it is an extremely painful and contrived product of chemical imbalances, nothing more. i remind myself of this when i find it to be all-consuming. it helps me.

p.s. - as much as i wrote this for you, i wrote it for me too. make 2020 great, and you will be too. 

p.p.s. find the joy in caring for something. get a cat maybe ðŸ˜»"

AskAstrologers,fckr498,t1_fckpvmd,1577731382.0,"oh, i am definitely also afraid of falling in love. it's all-encompassing when that feeling hits, so no worries there. even in maturity you will fight that. but the possessiveness and jealousy is something that i think all scorpios HAVE to grow out of in order to be the best partners they can be. 

i do like my placements! i have a leo rising and gemini mercury to temper out my natural aversion to people which is really awesome. it is a challenge though friend, absolutely. the infinite wells of emotion and empathy can be so draining to have to tap into just to interact with the world and no one but you will ever truly understand how exhausting and stressful that is, i would say that's been the hardest part for me with this sun/moon. the loneliness is kind of hard but that taurean fortitude does really well in making emotional obstacles easier to overcome. it was hard as a teenager and young adult but i grew out of it."
AskAstrologers,fcalyo6,t3_egu8uh,1577571872.0,"i'm a moon scorpio and taurus sun as well :) we're cool cats for sure man but that intensity of emotion and conflicting internal and spiritual desires can really make life hard if you don't figure out what you NEED instead of what you WANT. I find that the taurus sun makes that hard to do because i wanna just do what feels good all the time and the scorpio high strung-ness has left me with a propensity to drink excessively lol. 

you probably struggle with emotional lust as much as physical lust and you are a serial monogamist who won't fall in love but with the few and very best people you meet. the depths of your emotions are probably extreme and hard to contain, but adversely you probably (in the strangest way) enjoy the challenge of being uncomfortable so you will always work hard at maintaining a balance between the give and take of yourself so as never to become docile but also not so intense that you scare people away. you will fail, and you probably have, and it probably really sucked. but that taurus ascendant... man that should really do a lot to temper your scorpio-ness out when you interact with people. 

so basically, if i had to summarize, you're a taco that loves other tacos too intensely and likes to talk about cheese. this taco also has an insane sex life"
