Drugs,feq3awb,t1_feq2r4g,1579337022.0,"Uhm. You're doing meth, why you worrying. Ahahah. I'm kidding. Yes, if you're doing the things I said on a regular basis while using, you should be better off and not suffer as much of a terrible comedown or look like fucking shit. May I suggest r/meth they are actually going to be much more helpful and less judgy in that subreddit than they are here about it. Force yourself to eat something If you haven't. Literally make yourself if you have to. I promise. It will do wonders."
Drugs,feq2j3s,t1_feq28uh,1579336627.0,"My best advice is to keep it that way. Don't slide down the slope into daily use if you can avoid that. Because if that happens, it won't even be fun anymore. You won't feel euphoric or good, just normal, if that when you take it. And doing to much too often will damage your dopamine receptors which could be permanent or take many years to get back to an almost normal state.  I myself have no fucking dopamine, even after 7+ years clean. Cheers."

That depends on you as a person and how well you take care of yourself to begin with. If you take time between uses, eat right, drink water, shower, and are mentally okay to begin with it won't do nearly as much damage. Yes, you are consuming a product made with red phosphorus, iodine, Lye/Drain-O (muriatic acid), Yellow heet (antifreeze), Acetone and Isopropyl alcohol. Possible other chemicals depending on method of synthesis. So keep that in mind. It's alot of toxic shit to put into your body. Also assuming your ROA... The one that would probably be safest is ingestion. Some people can do it every day of their lives and still for the most part not be (ravaged or destroyed) hope any of this helps.
