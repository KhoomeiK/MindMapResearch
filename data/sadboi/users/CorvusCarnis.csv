You know how hard it is in the shelters and how difficult to find a new home for a grown dog. Is there any support system that you can turn to in your region? Something that will at least help you get therapy and food?"

Also if you do take those pictures Im still totally hyped to see them. Viking was an awesome cat, extremely protective and affectionate so of course my parents had to get rid of him cause you just can't be shitty to a child when you get a faceful of an angry hissing cat for it. I was devastated and missed him so much but as soon as I hit 18 and moved out I decided that I'm taking in strays and adopting cats in his memory. He may be gone but there are so many in this world who need love and home and care."
