She can be a bit annoying at times but she was the only honest one, and the only one who really thought things through.

I liked her, and I also liked Ray

I used to watch and talk about it with my girl friends and we used to joke about why are they even friends? They are so mean to each other and theyre really not good people

But we love the show haha"

In my case, I only watched the whole show until I was in my late 20's and I disliked Hannah from the start, Im not sure if I would have liked her if I watched the show earlier but I just find her annoying, selfish and spoiled.

I loved the show but I honestly disliked most of the caracteres, its weird."

I talked about this general sadness during this season with my therapist and she told me the 1st year is the hardest because it's the first everything without him, first holidays, first birthdays, etc.
It makes sense, it doesn't make it suck any less but hopefully next year we'll be in a better emotional place
I wish us both better things and to feel better

PaleMUA,f75cozl,t3_dqg84q,1573413860.0,"It sounds like the problem is your foundation is oxidizing on you, it happened to me when I started wearing foundation too, I chose different brands and usually the lighter tones and after applying they turned yellow/orange on my face.


From what I read after researched why that might happen, it could be your makeup routine.

Hydrating your skin and wearing the right primer, as well as using powder and setting spray after you finish your makeup sort of creates a barrierbelow and on top of the foundation to avoid or minimize oxidation.

I changed my makeup routine after I read about this and I never had this problem again.


Hope this helps"

Podcasts really saved me for some time,but thankfully I'm doing better and I can hear some music now, not a lot because I used to have this huge playlist for us, so that wound is still deep.

Imagine if it the other way round, if you suggested something to make her boobs bigger or something like that, it's kinda fucked up to start with, to suggest something to alter your SOs physical appearance in a superficial sense, and it's even more fucked up to insist on it after being told no once.

If a man was to do something similar to a woman, she would be told to leave him immediately without a 2nd thought and he would be called every  existing insult in the English language.
