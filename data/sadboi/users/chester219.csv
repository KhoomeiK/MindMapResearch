I've been a department chair at a large suburban HS for 15 years and also have been co-teaching (I teach history) as part of my course load with a special educator for about 10 years. It is difficult (even in these times) to get a position at a well-regarded suburban HS in English or Social Studies. One ""foot in the door"" if you are unwilling/unable to coach or teach a niche subject (like Econ) is coming in through SpEd. I've had 5 co-teachers in 10 years -- all have entered the profession in SpEd and gone on to gain certification in other areas (PE, English, Social Studies) and take positions in those areas. If you are a good, capable, hard-working teacher with a positive attitude, you will be able to get out of SpEd (if you want to get out) within 3-5 years max."

I recommend taking the Special Ed Praxis to get hired asap and get in the classroom, the demand for SpEd teachers is very high.  Once you are in the classroom, they will generally pay your tuition for the additional credits and within 2 or 3 years you can be teaching English. Plus the SpEd experience will provide a good foundation in classroom management."

Any student headed to college or to pretty much any job needs to have a basic understanding of simple software beyond Snapchat and Instagram.

When the dog barks, put him in the garage or bathroom. Somewhere with a door. Tell him firmly ""No barking. You are in time out"" and shut the door. He will be mad. He will bark more. Then he will stop. Don't leave him in there for too long, just long enough for him to realize he is being punished. Do this every time he barks..... All I have to do now with my dog is say, ""do you want to go in time out?"" And he stops barking. It works."
