combinedgifs,ev6ebyp,t1_ev5spj5,1564245767.0,But the complaint against manspreading isn’t about people having their legs shoulder width apart. Nobody cares about that. But everyone is free to care about someone who goes way beyond that and takes up extra space for no reason. Which does happen. I’ve sat next to those people. Much like taking up a seat with your bag. Or sitting in the aisle and blocking an empty seat. It’s inconsiderate.

If you can’t sit with your legs together, you either got some unhealthily large balls or some unhealthily tight pants. Either way, give your balls a break, and give everyone else a break by giving them some leg room too."

depression,etrk8np,t3_cd0hjp,1563122913.0,"It’s like existing just because you already do. I didn’t claim any holiday all year because I couldn’t even entertain the thought of planning to go anywhere. Eventually my manager told me they were going to write off my accrued holiday if I didn’t take it, and that the company isn’t worth it. I agreed and took a week. A week before it was due, I booked a trip. I went alone. By midday on the second day of being away, I had a crisis, fully, deeply feeling the loneliness of it all. The meaninglessness. 
Morally, I’m fully opposed to working for a shit company in a system reliant on money and exploitation, and yet still, it was very comforting to return to work. Structure helps. Being busy helps. I work hard, and it gets noticed. But other than caring for my cat, I see little point in any of it. Existing. 
Depression isn’t always crying in bed. For me, it almost never is.  It’s trying your best every day and never feeling fulfilled. It’s... well, it’s pretty shit. But damn, we’re all still here. We’re functioning somehow. On some level. Despite everything. And that’s huge. It’s amazing."

Although, there’s an interesting symmetry to the first episode, with Nathaniel driving the hearse and getting hit by the bus. He always seemed pretty carefree and died similarly.
Claire’s somehow survived all the problems of the family, spending her whole life dreaming of something else, and feeling the futility, but now she’s found a way to feel real hope, and to be at peace in life, despite how intimately she’s knows death."
