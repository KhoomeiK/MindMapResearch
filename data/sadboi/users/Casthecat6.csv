I do want to point out that I think your self awareness and emotional intelligence is phenomenal. I highly doubt your brother holds any bad feelings towards you for what had happened.

That in and of itself is the biggest thank you you could ever give him because I don't have the words to express how proud and happy I am when my brother's do something that improves their lives and makes them happy! 
The drug addiction is understandable from your pov too, I know for a fact if I didn't distract myself with both work and taking care of people I would've absolutely fallen down a rabbit hole of gambling and drinking (there was a time I didn't have people to look after and I was on my own and became quite self destructive as a result) I'm not saying I understand 100% because there's no way I could but I can imagine the difficult emotions and challenges you've faced. 
I hope both you and your brother end up unlearning some of those unhealthy behaviours as well as thriving in the present and future. You both deserve it.

wholesomegreentext,fooxisa,t1_foov00a,1587948560.0,"The draining part is so real, it's genuinely awful. It's even worse because sometimes you start to resent people because of how much you put into them but it's never a personal thing or a vindictive thing. It's like the longing of wanting to have your needs met by other people in the sense of emotional availability but never trusting people enough to actually do it for you so it can make you feel conflicted, between guilt that you feel that wanting and resentment because you feel like noone is reliable enough (you can only rely 100% on yourself) to help. Again, it's never personal to the person, it's just that deep seated mistrust of others because of the continous experience of never depending on anyone. 
For me, it took until 23 to even begin to scratch the surface, I was so rigid in the way I viewed the world and I guess to an extent I still am, I'm just self aware which I suppose makes it worse because I can't change it immediately. Also communicating my own needs to others without feeling like I'm bothering people (shame aswell) is a huge issue, I actually have a lot of inwards anger because of it. 

I looked after both my older and younger brother which was a weird dynamic but I was also enduring abuse from other relatives as well as my parents whereas they didn't from other relatives, just our parents, so I felt the need to protect them from everything so they didn't have to feel the way I felt, plus in my child mind I thought ""I've dealt with worse things so I can take it, they can't"" 

I know it feels like your brother won't ever be able to recover or change his mindset but it's genuinely never too late and he definitely deserves it. You should look into the karpman triangle :) maybe pass on some info from it. One thing I've figured from being fiercely self sufficient is when given information, you'll take it and run with it.

It can be unlearned though and as my psychologist said ""learn to be a coach not a rescuer"" 
Personally though, I'd imagine it'd be a lot harder being the person being rescued because that can lead to heavy co-dependence and I can't imagine how difficult being a functioning adult would be when you need other people to do things for you or help with life decisions etc. No disrespect to people that are codependent and I'm not saying it *always* leads to co-dependence, it's just a worse position to be in from my perspective."

Don't get me wrong, it doesn't make you bad or anything like that for having the illness! I just think it promotes using it as an excuse for certain behaviours instead of seeking help and this gets especially dangerous when some symptoms are toxic to others but it's put across that it's ok. (Hope that makes sense!) 
It also spreads gross misinformation about mental illnesses, The amount of people the claim to have ""endogenous DID"" which doesn't have any actual scientific backing other than people online claiming it exists is ridiculous. 

Saying this, I do think it's important to not boarder gatekeeping. The sentence ""I have xyz illness and I don't do xyz action"" isn't a fair analysis because firstly an illness isn't a personality trait so you can have overt, attention seeking and extraverted people who *do* have it and act in a different way from you. The illness has baseline symptoms but that doesn't mean it manifests in everyone in the exact same way. Some people hate talking about their diagnosis or MH issue but I'm very open about it, not on my personal social media but I don't care about who knows and I'm always happy to answer questions. I only say this because when I was 14 (10 years ago) I was super edgy and I did post stupid ""deep quotes"" but that wasn't because I was lying about my issues, it was because I didn't know how else to express how I felt.

I understand that it does look like a flippant comment but the fact that there are *so* many people who think these flippant comments aren't a big deal, make them themselves or dismiss it for not being as bad as overt sexism, they're not really see the wider implications of these types of attitudes.

Being able to use introspection and seeing others in a similar situation doing good can help you on that journey of growth and help you realise that your future isn't defined by your past.

unpopularopinion,fmsc27j,t1_fms9ac0,1586352187.0,"Its important to consider the brain development of teens. Are they stupid? No. Do they generally know when they're doing something they shouldn't? Yes. 
Does that mean that teenagers have a fully functioning brain, equipped to think about situations and consequences the exact same way adults do? No, they don't. Depending on their ages, teens go through egocentric stages because their pre-frontal cortex isn't fully developed to make good decisions and consider consequences thoroughly enough. That's exactly why they're not old enough to consent to multiple things or legally allowed to drink. 
Smashing their phone isn't a fitting punishment because in doing that you're doing it to make yourself feel better, not to teach anything valuable to the kid. If you want your kid not to lie and to be a well-rounded adult then you should use punishments that are fitting as well as explain the importance of real-life consequences rather than teaching them that the consequences of their wrongdoings are only going to come from you. Kids evade harsh punishments by learning to lie or hide their actions which is dangerous if they need their parents help in a bad situation (I'm happy to link the numerous peer reviewed studies that prove this). Taking a tantrum and destroying a child's things does nothing but show the kid that you're aggressive and unreasonable and upon that, they can't make up for their bad behaviour because you've already permenantly destroyed their phone. You could buy them a new one but that's a waste of money when you could've just confiscated their phone instead. 
Kids aren't property at the end of the day, it's your job to guide them, not control them with fear of your scorn. If this is a one time thing then no I wouldn't call them abusive parents, if this is what they resort to every time they want to handle their kids behaviour, then those actions are abusive and it's probably leading to resentment and thus leading to a child that'll constantly lie to you about what they're up to.

They can give you an assessment and refer you but they can't put it in your actual medical record that you have xyz, they can't even ask a psychiatrist to check their notes to give a diagnosis you need to have an actual assessment from a psychiatrist to get an actual diagnosis. Which reinforces a point, therapists aren't qualified to be able to diagnose complex disorders e.g eating disorders, OCD, psychosis etc all of which are actually co-occuring with depression. This needs specialised assessments and just because a therapist has said ""you don't have this"" without them actually seeing a specialist doesn't mean they don't actually have anything. 

Psychiatrist = diagnosing and prescribing medication
Psychologists = often works in tandem with psychiatrists and provides clinical treatments and specialises treatment plans and does research into therapies. 
Therapist = often works in schools and with families to deal with stress, relationship problems and offers help with mindfulness, helps patient problem solve current life issues. 

I don't know if you're using these terms synonymously but they all function independently. I'm not pulling this out of my ass, I'm training to be a psychologist and one of the first things they tell you is that psychologists and therapists don't diagnose because they aren't medically trained to do it (in the UK), it's a myth. Here's a [link](https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/psychological-therapies/differences-between-psychology-psychiatry-and-psychotherapy) for the differences.

A first time diagnosis isn't always reliable either. I've noticed from your profile your 12 and if you're going off of your peers then there's a lot to unpack. Firstly 1 in ever 4 people has depression so it's actually extremely common. Secondly, misdiagnosis exists. I was labelled wrongly to begin with, I seen a psychiatrist who told me at 17 I was agrophobic, likely had general anxiety disorder and depression. 7 years on I've been redisgnosed and treated for the correct diagnosis which has significantly improved symptoms. Not everyone who doesn't solidly get that first diagnosis is faking it, it's also insanely hard to actually get a diagnosis at that young an age.

Btw a therapist isn't qualified to diagnose, neither is a psychologist, only a psychiatrist can do that, even is a therapist tells you ""that's what it sounds like"" they can't legally put that in your health records."

entitledparents,fm741z4,t1_fm73cd1,1585812467.0,"Thank you for your clarification, I assumed that you meant not doing anything and just hoping something bad happens to them so I respect that you're putting it out their that it's important that people take action to find justice or atleast report crimes. Don't get me wrong I understand why people don't report some crimes, I understand that it's much more complex. I didn't report the person in my family that raped me out of fear and guilt. He can't touch anyone ever again because his hands are now paralysed but I think I'd feel insulted if someone called that karma because it doesn't give me justice but it does prevent anything more happening which is great but I don't want to correlate a coincidence, it was a result of him not looking after his health not his monsterous actions towards others. 

You're absolutely correct on the fact that the relationships are superficial and I admit I didn't think too much further into that, thank you for bringing it to my attention. 

I also respect that karma for you in this capacity is a comfort so I apologise if I insulted that or diminished it because it's not my intention to take something like that away from someone so I'll leave it at this, I fully understand your line of thinking here, I agree with it but I don't think I'd personally name it karma, I think the idea of karma if it's used in a way that's helpful, that doesn't promote passivity is great!

Abused people tend to gravitate towards abusive people because of revictimisation doesn't mean they somehow deserve it because of karma. 

If you look out for others and are always helpful it also risks being taken advantage of by toxic people. 

You're only really looking at one side of action = reaction
 
Being positive does draw in positive people, being negative makes you more likely to notice negative things because you're focusing on it but it's not black and white and it doesn't only work in one way. That does not mean that being nice will bring you nice things and frankly if you're only being nice for nice karma, chances are you're probably not an actually nice person (I use ""you"" generally not personally) that's what breeds mindsets like ""nice guys"" thinking being nice will result in dates. 

Whether karma is a defense mechanism or not, by trying to put it out their as fact it's essentially shitting all over anyone whose been through hell and back and hasn't gotten justice. It also takes responsibility off of the person whose dealt with crap for personal growth, relying on an unmeasurable force to fix your shit for you just because you've dealt with horrible things instead of actively working towards a better life, means you likely won't reach that better life because it requires you're effort and you're hard work to get there and the outcome of effort and hard work isn't karma, it's a result of your hard work.

Edit: just want to add that using karmic rewards and punishment also contributes heavily to people who are in abusive situations thinking they somehow deserve it for not being ""good enough"" it's a dangerous line of thought."
psychologystudents,fm6xv4e,t3_ft9cca,1585806524.0,"This is an interesting debate, I think it would be naive to assume that only psychology students understand or have knowledge on the topic or specifically knows more. 
There are a lot of different fields of psychology and I'd imagine sales specifically focuses on social psychology, so while they have knowledge of social psychology an average psychology student will have more knowledge on different areas as well as social psychology. Whether you consider that as knowing more is debatable. I think it also heavily depends on the level of study the student is studying and how experienced the sales person is. 
I did digital marketing before I started studying psychology, I worked for two years in that job before I left to study psychology but I learned a lot about psychology even in that job. I did read a lot about psychology prior to studying so that is a factor but I definitely learned more doing marketing than I did in my first year studying psychology so I think it's feasible for a salesperson to learn more. However, I know a hell of a lot more now than I ever did in my third year so going back to level of study and experience of sales person. 

I don't think being able to persuade, having a high interpersonal awareness (in the sense of picking up verbal and non verbal language) or being able to manipulate specifically equates to knowing more about psychology, I don't know much about what training sales people do but if those factors are the basis for knowing more about psychology, then a narcassist would be an expert."

Attraction or not, I still made points out with the attraction e.g it being multifaceted. I also made points that were just comparing genders. I don't think women have it worse than men but I also don't think men have it worse than women both sides have grievances that are quite different from one another. Of course the one you live you'll hyperfocus on what or why it's worse for you than otherwise."
rant,fm3vk4i,t1_fm3u64o,1585738626.0,"You don't need to link studies, I'm in my third year of applied psychology I'm well aware of the suicide rates in men but I'm also aware of the rates of depression. Higher suicide rates doesn't equate to more depressed men Vs women, it means that men take more lethal routes when attempting, women also attempt but are more likely to fail because they take less lethal routes. The rates of men to women having depression is actually higher in women specifically middle aged women.

Men to women ratios of graduating university are higher for women but research indicates multifactorial reasons for that. Do you want to explain how being attractive has anything to do with university performance or the ability to get a degree? It has nothing to do with admissions rates because they tend to be fairly similar on average.

Match rates aren't representative of wider dating statistics.
Men and women are much more complex than looking for one or two base traits when choosing a partner. Attraction is also subjective. For example, there are a whole bunch of women into ""dad bods"" even though it's not stereotypically attractive. 

I don't disagree that men are expected to put more effort in when it comes to pursuing a relationship, I don't disagree that that's unfair and I am all for both parties putting effort in. However, being creepy, perverted and desperate is not the fault of anyone bar the people doing it and yes btw I have seen ""attractive"" men do it too. It's actually pretty stupid to act in a disgusting manner towards people and then blame your looks for the reason you're not getting dates. A lot of ugly men have girlfriends and a lot of ugly men are married so there's a common denominator as to why others get rejected, their behaviour. That requires they take personal responsibility and a degree of introspection because even when people tell them it's their behaviour that's the problem they just either deflect and blame women or blame their looks. 

If you want to send studies go ahead, but I'm only accepting peer review papers of the actual studies themselves, not blogs, not random websites, not news articles. I should also point out that a paper existing doesn't make it sound, you need to understand how the methodology works, whether the studies didn't have researcher bias, whether they had a sample size representative of wider population, the list goes on. 

I'm not refusing to accept anything, I just recognise that your basis on why ugly guys have it worse is because of your own life. You've never actually lived as an ugly woman so you don't actually know what it's like to live as one bar glimpses of it from an outside perspective.

Men also judge and stereotype if not flat out shit on women when they're in the same position. Weird. 

Women can be pickier but guys don't have lower celibacy rates solely because women are picky they have lower celibacy rates because a stupid amount of men open conversations with lewd comments, dick pics or give a cringey desperate speech about how nice they are and how much they deserve a chance. Of course, not all guys do that, not all ugly guys do that but I garuntee it's not just ugly people in that category that are celibate. 

The experience isn't worse it's just different. The original conversation was about how ugly people have it harder and you made a sweeping comment about which gender had it worse, when you factor in the fact that women are a hell of a lot more likely to develop eating disorders or body dysmorphia just because of self esteem issues then the spectrum of who has it worst broadens significantly. 
Relationships aren't end all be all so it's kind of insane to think that just because ugly women might find a date easier or have more access to the opportunity of sex they must have it easier than ugly men.

Girls also have a lot of issue with gaining weight especially because of the fluctuations of estrogen month to month. Men have more visceral fat in their midsection because of their physique which actually aids in metabolism so if anything men lose weight much easier which also makes it easier to ""look fit"".  You do need to go to the gym to look fit as a woman but you're obviously bias because you find the female form attractive by default therefore of course an average woman's body is going to seem way more attractive generally than a man's average body, to you.

Wearing make up doesn't solve any problems because you can't be in a long term relationship and wear make up 24/7 lmao they're going to see you without makeup eventually and likely sooner than later. 
I actually do agree with the celibacy rates but that's likely down to multifaceted reasons rather than just one reason, not to mention those rates don't actually prove that ugly women have more success than ugly men it shows the averages for everyone. 

Ugly guys don't have it worse, they just end up with an attitude that causes them to make a lot of grossly inaccurate stereotypes about women which is what inevitably drives women away."

If it were a first time situation then yeah I could understand leway for specific things but this person stated they'd had been dealing with it for a long time and considering he had to look up the number it's not likely calling the helpline was a part of a management list.

It's not unreasonable for him to have stated in the first place that he had tourettes especially considering he stated that he was able to calm himself down prior to the call and it's not unreasonable for her to think a slur added onto the end of a sentence was just part of that sentence rather than a tic. People, including the people with mental health issues really need to have more compassion for these volunteers that have to listen to endless crisis and never knowing what happens to the person after the call has ended, that can have a huge negative impact on your mental health so it is entirely reasonable to be mindful of that fact when speaking to these people."
