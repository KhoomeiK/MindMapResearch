I had to get one and while it’s way harder emotionally than I thought it would be, I’m glad I did it. Knowing that I could call the police if I even saw his car near me made me feel a bit safer. I notified my work as well and our security officers were made aware and could call if he even stepped on property. It really did help."

Anxiety,f6llueu,t1_f6l7mtt,1572952143.0,"The only reason I don't call out sick is that if I did, it would make tomorrow worse."
Anxiety,f6lltex,t1_f6k37z9,1572952104.0,"The same happened to me! My boss wouldn't give me a hug because he's probably afraid of a sexual harassment claim but he said he didn't judge me for crying. 

I hate when work stress becomes anxiety."
Anxiety,f5z97yi,t3_dpwukd,1572570593.0,"Any anxiety/depression meds can cause serotonin syndrome. I tried Pristiq 50mg earlier this summer and after 6 weeks of being on it, I started developing some symptoms. My psych took me off of that dosage quickly. 

Your psych knows what meds you're on and what to look out for. Keep a journal for how you're feeling daily. That was the biggest help for me to nail down how my meds are working for me. The biggest symptom that set my doctor off was being unable to control my emotions. Everything was magnified and the extremes - sadness, happiness, anger, etc. The fact that I was able to verbalize what was happening around me and including dates helped significantly."
Anxiety,f5z8knj,t3_dpw7fv,1572570091.0,I've started coloring when I can't sleep. I try to get out of bed until I'm sleepy. There are times when I'm up for two hours after waking up in the middle of the night. I've also started a routine once I get in bed to calm my mind and body before I turn out the light and fall asleep.
DisneyWorld,exix3xn,t3_csi3ab,1566337367.0,I think your best bet would be to buy a Disney Gift card in advance. Some of the ones around Epcot are actually on a bracelet so you can wear them.
Anxiety,ewiyxl0,t3_cohwjf,1565458899.0,I use the Calm App Sleep Stories as a popup blocker and journaling. It's the only way to stop it for me.

DisneyWorld,etpqpiz,t3_ccsi2y,1563062279.0,I've had pretty good luck booking FP on the same day. I've gone a few times without any booked and was still able to get some top rides like FOP. Don't stress! :)
