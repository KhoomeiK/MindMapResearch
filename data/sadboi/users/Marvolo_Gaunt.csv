So, I hope you'll allow me to make some suggestions. If you wish to stick to the topic, you could, for example, go deeper on each of the branches you've mentioned/compare them and produce a series of short videos (those must have been covered already, too, though, so probably look for a less obvious angle/less known concept/gripping controversy?). Or do a longer introduction to one of the branches. As you may know, reading up on the subject is a great way to discover something that may help you stand out. By the way, since you're already familiar with some of the books on the topic, you could also review one of the sources on your list, I feel like there isn't enough genuine book reviewers among breadtubers.
