There are people I thought were mutually OUR friends when really they surfaced as just HIS friends. Later on, they realized how crazy he'd made me to be when in reality the truths came to light, which I believe most of the time always do. I loved having my redemption, but, I also realized how easily those ""friends"" could sway the other way just by believing someone else's BS over what they SHOULD have known about me as a person overall. For some, it took time for them to redeem themselves as my friends, but it took quite a bit of time to build trust with them again, but I had to think of it as the position they were in, and, give them the benefit of the doubt, to a certain extent. I feel like my nex manipulated everyone, or tried to, back then, and eventually everyone began seeing through it but it took others longer than it took me."

I knew I wasn't but I had to prove via screenshots to people with things he said years ago to prove my point, and they were taken back by it, but unless I had that proof, I'd probably still be thought of as crazy. Eventually he'd confess to certain people how awful he did and knew he treated me and he didn't deserve me in his life, but he didn't understand why he treated me the way he did knowing how much he loved me.

Of course, we were not together when I was diagnosed, and he was with someone new, and they had a baby on the way. My doctor told me if he's the one that gave it to me and had a baby on the way, she said it could be a strain that could affect the baby when it came out of the birth canal. She was kind of insinuating I should inform them, if I could. My ex and I weren't speaking at the time, but I took it upon myself to be selfless, and for that baby's sake, find some way to contact him and inform him. She ended up having a C-section, but still, I did what I did because it was the right thing.

10 years ago, I was in a relationship with someone I was completely in love with, saw myself marrying and having a family with. Now, I'm single, by choice, and I've accepted I may never have children of my own, and my ideas of relationships are far different than they were back then. I'm so much more open to different relationship dynamics than I ever thought I'd be.

When I was around 27/28, I did a lot of therapeutic exercises in dealing with a particular tough time in my life, and I had to dive within myself to explore how I got to that point, and, how to become better and how to notice more around me to avoid getting into a mess I'd previously gotten into. I studied a lot more psychology and behavioral tactics than I did earning my BA in Psychology, and I just learned to rely only on myself. 

I'm so much more confident, stable all around and secure with myself. Of course, we all have those setback days, and I've accepted they will happen, and they don't mean utter failure, but just a fact of being human. 

My mind is way more open and I see through a lot more BS. I don't take as much personally, and my patience has wore much thinner. I don't play stupid games when it comes to relationships, and that means friendships as well. I'm not going to fight to keep someone in my life who doesn't want to be there.

I was young, but wise. I took the right moves in talking to HR about what was going on, and them advising me about my age, and inexperience, yet I know when I'm being disrespected, and I knew and know the right and wrongs of how to be treated regardless of someone being your supervisor. I never acted entitled, or immature. I had talked to my parents, both in the business world, and other mentors about my situation, so I was prepared in how to disclose my information and how to protect myself. 
I would never have left without another job lined up but that was not happening. Fortunately, I was living with my boyfriend at the time, who could support us with the job he had, while I found something else. My parents even supported that as well, so I made the big leap to quit. 

I made up a lie about leaving and going back to school. It was truly a consideration, but I decided against it eventually. It was the only way I knew to leave without any questions or any accusations as to why I was leaving. My parents told me to do this. 

The aftermath? Several people in the department commended me for finally leaving. They had noticed how disrespectful my supervisor had been to me, and wondered how I took it so long.

NarcissisticAbuse,fpona7d,t3_genfpc,1588787360.0,"It hurts. But you look. I know the feeling. You have to face it, for the moment. I forced myself to do the same, and surprisingly it allowed me to move forward faster than being in denial of things. It won't happen overnight but one day, as cliche as it sounds, you'll realize they weren't the first/last thing you thought about, and you weren't going through this painful feeling in your chest all day long. You'll be okay. I know things are fresh now, but you will get there. I was where you are....for a long time. And, I don't know how long it took, I couldn't tell you, but just one day I was good....and stronger."
NarcissisticAbuse,fpolpbe,t3_geo3wq,1588786602.0,"I will praise my ex on this point. He knows how to calm me down when I have had panic or anxiety attacks or become overwhelmed with something......he knows how to relax me. 

He knows how to remain calm in most every situation, even ones where he's to blame. Inside he's freaking out weighing all of his options, but displays himself to be entirely at peace. 

Very rarely have I seen him get feisty, and of course, at times where it's hardly worth it. He remains calm in situations he SHOULD be riled up about, yet acts like there's no point to getting riled up. lol. 

I've heard the overreacting or ""reading into things"" too much before. Yet, I was calling him out on things he didn't want to deal with or he wanted to remain in denial about. I just can't stand the fake facade anymore, and I don't know how I tolerated it for so long."

As soon as you turn a new leaf, and see through their BS, it's as if they get frightened and run the other direction, or try destroying what you have. My demands are upmost respect and honest, and just communicate. Not at all hard demands to follow when in any kind of relationship with me, friend or romantic. 

The new self is definitely an empowering feeling, and I can relate to that. It seems with each day that passes, I get versions of that every so often, so welcome to your new life. :)"

I don't know if she's a narc herself or what. In all honesty though, I appreciate karma doing its fine work, but he got far more than he deserved. He got his own medicine and then some and then some more. It did make my ex more aware of how he treated me, and how he shouldn't have done me, but this girl has manipulated him far beyond what he ever did to me unfortunately. There's true stockholm syndrome there, not on my end though."

NarcissisticAbuse,foyolgi,t3_ga8mny,1588176286.0,"It's strange how perspective can change your reactions and your mindset with everything even abusive situations. For me, my ""walking on eggshells"" progressed over time, it wasn't immediate whatsoever.
I'm at that stage, and have been for awhile, where I can laugh and shed very few tears over him, if any at all. My tears are pretty much PTSD that I can't really control when I talk about it. I'm not feeling sad right now, but the memories/pain will always remain I feel."

polyamory,fouj10m,t1_fou4kmx,1588084966.0,this is the way it should be.

AskWomen,folr94b,t3_g86fxt,1587868604.0,"Time has helped. I don't know if I will fully heal. It seems when I feel I'm not going to experience any triggers or setbacks, they end up sneaking in on me. I'm so much stronger than I was, but the memories of what I experienced and the turmoil and harassment I went through won't ever be forgotten unfortunately. 

The rose colored glasses didn't come off until afterwards, and after I had separated myself from my ex, and, it took a lot of undressing the good to see what was underneath unfortunately.

You know you're dealing with a narc when you have to really alter your thinking when you have to deal with them. It is a sad way they think and live, but most are more aware of it than you know.

I used to be so outspoken and love sharing my honesty, but I stopped with him at least 2 years ago because he knows what I say is true, and that I know him better than anyone else, and every time I'd do it, he'd get so defensive and come back at me 10x harder and say hurtful things or ghost me, even worse, and, I just adjusted my behaviors. I'm so much more powerful and stronger than I have ever been now, and, as much as he craves to know my thoughts on his life choices, I no longer have the energy or care to share them because I know the outcome will just be ridiculous.
