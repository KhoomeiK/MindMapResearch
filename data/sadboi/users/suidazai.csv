G59,fqyt03s,t3_glgi0t,1589754056.0,"This about to buried but, the reason i feel this project is so divisive is because this seems like one of the first times scrim really only focused on the sounds he wanted to explore and nothing else. He didn‚Äôt keep a $B guideline to funnel his music through, this was truly a project made to be whatever he wanted it to be and nothing else. Whenever an artists makes a project without keeping what the fans may want in mind, people get angry. 

I feel the negative reactions are understandable and valid, however scrim needs a chance. Let him figure out making sober music, let him figure out making music without ruby! Let him explore sounds freely so he can hone into what he really likes by himself and become even more legendary. You guys really don‚Äôt realize hes doing this without two major crutches, if not more, and he still fucking delivered."
