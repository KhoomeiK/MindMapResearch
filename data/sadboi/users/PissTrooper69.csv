I would personally stay away from cocaine-it’s all cut to shit anyway, if you wanna snort baby laxative and drywall you can do that for less than 80$ a g-and would recommend you stay away from any stims because they literally cause brain damage from the excitotoxicity. As far as depression is concerned opiates are your friend, your lover, your safety, your inspiration, your _heroine_. Liquor will make your problems worse so it’s good you stay away. Ecstasy will fry your brain too, stay away. GABAergenics are also nice, depending on how you respond"

That’s probably because I’m also shy and have difficulty in approaching people-because in all honesty, I’m a bitch-but you get what I’m saying.

Also, it’s just nice to drink something. It’s that repetitive action that makes you wanna keep doing it. Not to mention the variety of liquors. There’s so much to pick from, the bottles are so pretty, and nothing tastes like alcohol except alcohol. Some people genuinely like the taste. My favorite is Chivas 

It’s almost like cigs. There are so many brands. So you feel special when you find “your brand”. I don’t smoke (I have but not addicted, it’s just a treat now and then) but the idea of trying all the different kinds is what made me want to smoke. It’s that repetitive action where every little inhalation releases a wee bit of dopamine. Every sip of booze you take you’re a little closer to feeling like yourself."
