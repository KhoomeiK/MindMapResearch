entitledparents,fpryd2w,t3_gf08f2,1588864345.0,"This story makes me so mad but I‚Äôm glad it turned out like it did. 

So yeah, the pretty face at the desk is true here I the South. I worked a job once where my older male boss asked me to go sit at a desk in the lobby and ‚Äúgreet the bankers when they show up.‚Äù I was in the middle of doing invoices for our accounts and extremely busy. There was no computer, phone etc at the front desk. It was literally just an empty desk. I told him I was busy and asked what I was supposed to do at an empty desk. He responded, ‚Äújust sit there and look pretty.‚Äù Never in my life have I been so dumbfounded. 

After I turned in my resignation I was asked to come to a meeting with the owner, the VP and the Director of Business Development - all old white men. The owner and the Director told me that I was ‚Äúbeing emotional‚Äù and that ‚Äúif I were their daughter...‚Äù (I was 30 at the time if that matters). I was furious throughout the whole meeting and spoke my mind before I left. The VP never said a word during this meeting and actually came to apologize to me before I left, telling me that I made the right choice. 

So yeah, that definitely happens in the South and it isn‚Äôt even an unspoken rule sometimes."
AskReddit,fpqdudu,t1_fpqby9f,1588820575.0,"I could say so much but I‚Äôll keep it short and say that shady stuff happened in all departments, from HR to field ops to billing practices and so on. I worked in every department in that company except for maintenance over my 10 years and I was constantly appalled at what I walked into on a daily basis. I was often fighting against the rest of management for change and a better work environment overall. 

Here‚Äôs a short example: say you‚Äôre a paramedic and you hurt yourself lifting a patient and you go out on worker‚Äôs comp. You finally heal and come back to work... and you get fired. It was a pretty standard practice to find a reason to let an employee go after coming back off of worker‚Äôs comp. That was one of the things that disgusted me the most about that place."
