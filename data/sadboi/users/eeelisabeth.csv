corsets,fohnnib,t3_g7hnn2,1587769077.0,"We have very similar body types I think! I‚Äôve read that weightlifting can actually make your waist smaller, not necessarily bigger. But everyone is different so it‚Äôs hard to say. I wear a waspie shaped corset and it does almost give an hourglass shape. Tho for our body types it‚Äôs a little more Audrey Hepburn-esque. When I wore my corset every day I did start to notice my waist measurement went down about an inch even though my weight stayed the same. It‚Äôs definitely possible, it just takes time. I like having a waist training corset that‚Äôs also easy to wear under clothes so I can create a silhouette. From what I‚Äôve seen on this sub a higher quality one is definitely your best bet.
