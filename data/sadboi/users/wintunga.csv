Right now, I see him as the the top creator of Star Wars material. I feel like he understands Lucas' vision and executes it pretty well IMO. He did an excellent job with The Clone Wars, Rebels was great, and I loved The Mandalorian. In my opinion, the quality of the overall Star Wars universe is improved when he is involved which is most obvious through his contribution to The Clone Wars. I think everything I've seen by him is superior to the quality of the prequels and I love the prequels (They had much more potential though). A lot of people were very disappointed in sequels, myself included, so I feel like that is why the Filoni love is so strong.

I just quickly want to say that I agree with what Filoni has to say here about Luke but I hate the execution. It just seems so out of character for Luke to consider attacking his nephew in his sleep so heavily that he would ignite his lightsaber especially when we consider his refusal to strike down Vader. I wish the roles between Luke and Ben were reversed but Luke still blamed himself because he failed his nephew and apprentices. Since things happened the way they did I feel like we need some more insight into Luke's past to explain his behavior more. I hope there's going to be a story about how Luke almost lost his Jedi Order before Ben Solo betrayed him or something similar because I feel like that would fix some problems for me."
progun,fqwqply,t1_fqw26qv,1589714369.0,"I believe the point of body cams is to both protect the police by backing them up when they take the proper course of action or to hold them accountable when they do not with evidence a third party can witness directly. If the police do not wear body cams they are choosing not to be held accountable so as a result I don't think it's reasonable to assume we can trust them more than the average person. I am especially suspicious of the officers in question because they were conducting a no knock raid on a home in plain clothing which, considering the obvious risks involved, appears to be a situation where someone with nothing to hide would want to have his or her ass covered.

It's important to note that our justice system is explicitly based upon the principle that the accused is assumed innocent. Considering this, a judge or jury should place more weight on reports that cast the accused in a favorable light. I don't know anything about what happened beyond what I've read but I find it more reasonable to believe the guy and his neighbors than the police if we assume this unless we have some evidence to conclusively prove the cops side of the story which a body cam would have provided.

Considering that a body cam would have resolved this issue it seems suspicious to me that either none of the officers suggested they wear body cams for the raid or an officer did and it was decided against. I really want to hear what they give as an explanation for why the decision not to wear a body cam was made."

I think every country is racist to some extent but some are more racist than others. I would say there is a threshold at which racism becomes so prevalent within a society that at this point one could reasonably say that a state is racist but I'm not sure where that is. I think the US still is but I don't know I'm not an expert. Either way we've come so far in such a short time as a nation that I am proud of our ability to move forward. Because of this I assume by the time I am old racism will not nearly be as much of a concern considering that injustices are being reported on, acknowledged, and addressed by the American people and government albeit inadequately at this point with events such as George Zimmerman's arrest and trial showing this.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fqre3bj,t1_fqqyi6g,1589582560.0,"I disagree. 

Would it be fair to say that the US is a racist government then because I think it is.  Not that the people who compose the government necessarily are racist but I would say that the institutions and those who do not support reform are. It's kind interesting looking at the connotations associated with the words government and country. Like, both refer to a state but in different capacities. I feel like the word government refers to US political institutions and operatives while the word country can also be used in a less political manner and is more associated with actual citizens and locations.

 I feel like a major problem with many Americans is that we're in our own little US bubble but also we don't really see ourselves as an American the way I think a German person would see being German (Just think about how important European roots are to a lot of people in America) because I feel like Americans don't really have to assert or defend their country against neighbors on a regular basis. Like it or not, we are judged based on where we are from, and even if you don't travel you hear about how foreigners hate Americans and I think that many Americans have some trouble accepting that. I think it's because we just don't fucking own our shit. 

America is definitely getting some heat when it comes to race issues and deservedly so because two black individuals have been shot to death wrongfully in two separate incidents within the past 2 months and the people who did it were trained as police by the US government. Not only that, but the boyfriend of one of the victims was also arrested for assault with a deadly weapon when he used his gun to defend himself from the police who used a no knock warrant, were not in uniform and, did not announce themselves as police according to him. I feel like if there were any justice this man would have the charges dropped because he's already been punished enough considering people burst in his home with guns, killed his girlfriend while he was there, and might even get away with it. To me, the fact that criminal justice system is still pursuing this man seals it to me. The system is broken. He is a victim, he should not be harassed any more than he already has considering he's probably traumatized, but they are going to force him to relive it so they can get a chance to send him to jail for exercising his 2nd amendment right.

The problem is that saying that racism is the government's fault is that as citizens of a democracy we have some degree of responsibility for how it operates. That means other people from other countries will hold us individuals responsible for out government's actions to an extent because collectively we all agreed that this is the best course of action for the country. Considering that I don't hear about this kind of stuff happening in other countries I believe my country certainly is more racist than average and to pretend otherwise is just sticking your head in the sand. Other countries are certainly worse for sure considering we haven't committed genocide for a long time while some places like China are going at it strong. I do not think most Americans are racist but let's say 25% of the population is (and I mean about half of us voted for Trump so that number probably should be higher); I would say that if you act racist 25% of the time you are racist maybe not heinously racist but it's there and it's ugly. A country is a collection of individual citizens. I feel like if enough individual citizens are racist the country is too even if it is not the majority who are because the effects of racism are cancerous to society in that they spread and infect the whole if not combated aggressively. I realize that this impression of Americans will reflect on me when I go to a foreign country and I can't control that aside from shifting that view and presenting myself as I am. It really does suck, and I don't like it, but the fact that we're hearing about this tells me that things are getting better overall."

PoliticalHumor,fqosfrr,t1_fqo07fy,1589523491.0,"At this point I really hope you don't understand what I'm saying about self control because you just keep claiming I said things I didn't and every time I simply state that you are misrepresenting my argument which is starting to get frustrating.

So, my first inclination when possessing a firearm is what I assume would be the same as yours or any other reasonable person's. I don't think anyone without the mentality that guns are a last resort should have a gun. As I said above, I think/hope you're confused about how I'm explaining self control. When I say a person with a gun should have self control I don't mean that they are constantly exerting effort in order to prevent themselves from killing a person at all times.

What I mean is that in critical moments when a situation is uncertain a responsible gun owner has to have self control and self awareness on a level that would allow them handle a gun responsibly because people are not naturally equipped to handle danger in a logical fashion. This requires training and discipline because a person is not born understanding how to properly respond to a conflict or use a gun; they are not innate traits and they must be developed before getting and once receiving a gun. I assume any person who thinks of themselves as a responsible gun owner would use a gun only as a last resort but I think the part self control plays in this is knowing when that is because you can always think ""I hope and pray that I never ever have to use this as a last resort""  but if you think that a gun is your last resort and you're wrong you are not a responsible gun owner. In my view self control is the actualization of this responsibility because once you have developed self control you will say ""I hope and pray that I never ever have to use this as a last resort"" and then actually do that.

The commenter you responded to said

>Think of it like karate. You are taught how to handle yourself but not to start shit - only to finish it if someone else takes it there.

To me that sounds like someone who is only willing to use a gun as a last resort if he feels as though he is in serious danger. What I am saying is that I feel like we are in agreement here but you just want to argue because you want to paint this person as some hotheaded prick who's gonna shot people at a moments notice.

You stated that

>you people only pick and choose when you are responsible gun owners.

I found this fucking hilarious. At this point in my life I pretty much just chill so I highly doubt I'll be in dangerous situations leading to my belief I don't need or want a gun and never have or ever will because in my life having a gun would just be an unnecessary danger. I actually find it funny that just because we're arguing about responsible gun use on opposite sides you think I own or have ever owned a gun as though it's somehow impossible for me to be a principled person who likes to argue with someone because they *clearly* are wrong. I mean, nice ad hominen, but considering that this line of argument is considered fallacious you might want to try something else because using it kind of makes you look lazy to people who might actually take you seriously otherwise; especially when you make assumptions and accusations that are factually incorrect. While I know for certain that I do not want guns personally I'm actually very unsure on what my precise stance is on gun use for self defense in general because I think it's foolish to own a gun or put yourself in situations where you would need one but at the same time I highly value individual liberty.

Pertaining to the direct argument, as of right now my current opinion is that it is legal to own a firearm and if we are being charitable to this guy and believe what he is saying then I think it is reasonable to assume he is handling his gun properly and I have no problem with it. He could be lying but how the fuck could I know unless he's telling blatant lies about information I actually have access to. I believe that the foundation of having good conversations on reddit is giving people the benefit of the doubt because everyone is on here anonymously. That being said, I'm not an idiot, if I'm suspicious of someone I'll look through their post history or look up articles to fact check people but when there is no way of knowing if someone is telling the truth or lying on reddit I choose to believe them. Certainly not fully, but it's not like it really matters if this dude is really a responsible gun owner or not but rather whether the idea that there are people who exists who have self control and are willing to use their guns properly which there are. Should these responsible gun owners allow us to be at the mercy of irresponsible gun owners as a result, I don't think so and something should be done about that, but realistically I don't think guns are going away anytime soon and right now I'm not too concerned about someone who has a gun as long as they have discipline and are able to exert self control."
PoliticalHumor,fqo3azr,t1_fqngusd,1589506702.0,"I would say that depends on how securely the guns and ammo are stored. If they're stored securely where children cannot get access to them then I see no problem. I think it's very important that people embrace and/or accept history. Guns are a part of that history so if someone has a gun that was a family heirloom I feel it would be wrong to take that away. I wouldn't want to own a gun in my home but if someone wants to take the risk I wouldn't judge. 

Honestly, I care about stricter gun control in that I think it makes sense and I don't want people to die needlessly. If things like ending gunshots loopholes or establishing a federal gun registry happened so states could coordinate more effectively and dangerous people cannot get access to guns nationwide I would be happy. However, I expect it wouldn't matter to me much as an individual because I don't really get in dangerous situations. Despite my comment above, while I do support stricter gun control I'm not sure if I want guns for self defense to be legal or not because I highly value personal liberty in principle. Either way my opinion on that doesn't matter because that change is impossible and regardless my life won't change much either way (most likely). 

That being said, owning guns for anything other than hunting or collecting is stupid because it puts the owners and their loved ones in unnecessary danger. At the end of the day it's your choice to have a gun and I respect that but no one is getting sympathy from me if a loved one is killed because they decided to bring a gun in the home. To clarify, I will feel bad for the victim but have no sympathy for people who put their family in harms way for no good reason."
PoliticalHumor,fqnrmn3,t1_fqn6x4i,1589500114.0,"So, you think that a child knows how to control their emotions? I hope you are aware that everyone is a child at some point. I never said that it takes a ""great deal"" for one to develop their self control in order to hold a gun but I guess that's true but not just for this guy for everyone. Humans are not born responsible and I'm not sure if we have an innate sense of right and wrong. In order for one to gain self control in general it needs to be developed even if one has an aptitude for it. Self control as it pertains to guns does not just come out of nowhere. You can't just give a fucking maniac a gun and say ""now promise to be good"". Of course I recognize that is ridiculous. A gun is a huge responsibility so if a parent were thinking about teaching their child to use a gun I would hope they would only do so if they thought their child already had a decent amount of self control. 

Additionally, I feel that even if a person already has self control in general that general idea of exercising self control has to be applied to the specific techniques used when handling a gun such as trigger discipline. So, what I mean is that I assume the original commenter already had self control before he had ever held a gun and developed that self control into a practical ability specifically tailored for gun use due to his training. I think an average person would have to train with a gun extensively in order to properly understand how to use one responsibly. I like to consider myself a responsible person who has self control but I recognize that if someone gave me a handgun today I would not be qualified to use one because my self control is not specifically tailored for gun use at this time."
PoliticalHumor,fqn3fn5,t1_fqmxf81,1589488016.0,"But my point is that he is stating that he has developed his self control. People have emotions and that is part of being human but mastering those emotions is what self control is. If someone has an urge to harm another unjustly, which is common, but does not that is self control. I do not think anyone can ever not have to exercise self control in some capacity just to live a normal life even without a gun. Otherwise, everyone would just do what they desire at all times and society would have more problems. I mean, a lot of people barely have any self control already. If no one did then that would be bad. 

A person having self control rather than lacking it is a virtue not a vice because humans are not perfect and have desires and that cannot be avoided by anyone. If one has the will to overcome their desires then I would consider them responsible. I feel like you are equivocating between him saying it takes a person who has a great deal of self control to carry a gun safely and you saying that it takes him a great deal of self control to safely carry a gun. Maybe he has so much self control that he does not even have to consciously think about using his gun properly because after years of training with firearms he has gained the required discipline to use them in a
responsible manner despite that fact that he may not naturally be that disciplined."
PoliticalHumor,fqmr578,t1_fqmcr8n,1589482147.0,"I feel like you're just kind of being an asshole with this comment. I don't like people carrying guns around but you know what he meant. In general, some people inherently have a great deal of self control and do not need to develop it as much while others have to work on it more throughout their lives. I think we can all agree that we would rather have someone who has a high degree of self control have a gun than someone who does not. If a person is a responsible gun owner they should understand that their gun has the power to kill people and that this is not a thing to be taken lightly both out of a sense of moral duty and self interest because killing a person is not something one can take back. If a person uses their gun unwisely they could be responsible for a death, have to bear the weight of that, and most likely have to go to jail as well. I don't think someone who with a gun who has that level of insight is a coward.

If a person is responsible enough to understand this and stay that way I don't really see why they shouldn't have a gun but the problem is a lot of gun owners aren't which is a serious problem. Also, staying that way is also a problem because the mind is a fragile thing and we can't be sure a responsible gun owner will remain responsible. I have bipolar disorder and if I had access to guns before I suffered my first manic episode things could have gotten very scary very fast. I don't believe I would have hurt anyone if I did because I know I didn't want to hurt people but I was very scared, irrational, and confused so adding a gun to that equation would not have been in anyone's best interests especially mine because even if I didn't hurt someone else the police might have hurt me if I had a gun because I was so out of it."

I see hunting as a worthwhile activity that is worth preserving because it connects people to nature and I find it more ethical to hunt deer than raise beef.

I feel as though if you don't hunt though owning a gun is fucking stupid because the only reason a person could give to have a gun aside from hunting is to defend themselves or just have fun shooting shit for no reason. While some gun owners think they're special snowflakes who can and will save themselves and others with their guns statistically a person and their family are in much more danger with a gun than without one so the defense reasoning is out. So, that leaves shooting guns for fun and, I mean, I know shooting a gun is fun because I've done it but so are plenty of other things that are much less dangerous. I don't hate people who use guns for self defense (my grandpa uses a pistol for self defense) or fun but I think it's really foolish and bad for society."
todayilearned,fqmc86j,t1_fqm4geu,1589475050.0,"They have an episode on Hello Kitty in the Netflix docuseries The Toys That Made Us. You should check that out because it's really interesting and similar to what you're talking about in that most of the toys featured such as He-Man, G.I Joe, and the Transformers had shows created to sell the toys. The series states that the characters from these shows were created solely to sell toys so a lot of focus is put on how the characters and media associated with them were crafted in such a way so as to make them appeal to their target audience through aesthetics that appeal to a certain fantasy. Even toy characters franchises that weren't as successful in television media focus on this such as Barbie and how she represents the concept of the ""ideal adult woman"" who can have it all. The series also has a Star Wars episode that focuses a lot of attention on a Bobba Fett toy which is interesting because the only reason people care about Bobba Fett is because he has a cool aesthetic.

While the series is great I wish they had focused a little more on how the toys featured in the series exploited gender roles to sell their products and subsequently reinforced those gender roles as a result because most if not all of them definitely did. I remember a little time was spent on this with Barbie but not so much for the other toys. I don't really blame the creators of the toys and their media for this because they were a product of their time. I mean, from a financial standpoint it made sense for them to appeal to societal norms to make it easier to sell their products and I don't think it was done maliciously.

dankmemes,fpqy63m,t1_fpqxa3l,1588835864.0,"I agree but for some reason I didn't like her as much in Endgame. I saw Endgame first but when I went back to see Captain Marvel I liked her more because they had more time to flesh her out as a character. I originally thought it was because Brie Larson was better as a lead than as a supporting character in an ensemble but after thinking some I realized that her movie and Endgame kind of screwed over her character when it comes to the audience's ability to relate with her.

In Endgame she was more one dimensional and less charming. Captain Marvel was incredibly powerful and angry at Thanos but the audience was never shown why Thanos and the snap mattered to her personally while characters like Tony who had Peter turn to ash in his arms or Thor who had his brother, friend, and people killed by Thanos while we have to do our best to imagine why Captain Marvel is invested. While I really liked Captain Marvel and Endgame Marvel Studios set up the character Captain Marvel to be hated by fans regardless of who played her because they failed to make the character relatable in Endgame which many people, like myself, saw before Captain Marvel.

If Captain Marvel had another movie before Endgame to show the audience her relationship with Thanos and the snap I feel like she would have been received better by fans. Hell, even if they gave her one scene in the beginning of endgame where she's saving aliens from an intergalactic conflict and she does something like save a girl from an explosion by flying in and grabbing her at the last second only to have the girl and half of the people around her turn to dust as she looks around, she then hears her pager ringing, looks at it, says ""Thanos"" or something, and proceeds to fly towards earth people would have liked her more because she'd be seen as a person who was affected by Thanos and has a reason to fight him aside from Thanos bad people dust. What we got in Endgame was a nuke with a smirk whose sole purpose was to serve as a deus ex machina which most people did not respond to well. If the audience had a reason to care about Captain Marvel and her struggles her coming in to blow up Thanos' ship and fight Thanos would have been an amazing moment but I'm pretty sure my reaction when I first saw was ""Wow, Captain Marvel is REALLY powerful"" which was cool but it could have been so much more because I didn't know much about Captain Marvel's motivations so I didn't really care about her as a character.

Added a huge edit because I developed my thoughts on Captain Marvel and Brie Larson."

OTMemes,foxuz99,t1_foxf4nn,1588157191.0,"This is from a post made by  u/alexanderwales 

Leia has a much harder time on the farm than Luke. She's a lot more forceful and brash, and given the backwards nature of Tatooine, is probably discouraged from doing a lot of ""male"" things like repairing droids, shooting womp rats, and piloting. Her reaction to this is probably not to learn her place, but to rebel - hard. She runs away at fifteen years old, and thanks to her powerful Force sensitivity, becomes a hot-headed smuggling pilot. Obi-wan spends quite a bit of time trying to chase her down.

Meanwhile, Luke is learning diplomacy on Alderaan. His more reserved nature more perfectly matches with royal society, and he becomes a diplomatic force to be reckoned with, and later a senator at a very young age. Though never quite as daring as Leia, he still joins up with the Rebel alliance due to their treatment of non-Humans.

Events begin wildly diverging when the rebellion obtains the plans for the Death Star. Kenobi is chasing down the renegade Leia rather than on Tatooine, and so it's unclear where Luke's ""diplomatic mission"" would end up taking him. It's likely that he would be captured by Darth Vader, who would reveal his heritage to him and attempt to bring him over to the Dark Side without all of the playing around.

Kenobi catches up with Leia somewhere outside of Kashyyyk. She's hooked up with a Wookie and a smuggler by the name of Han Solo, but after Kenobi explains matter to her and tells her that he life is in danger, she explains that working for the Rebellion doesn't really interest her - unless she can get something out of it. Kenobi agrees to train her in the ways of the Jedi, and the other members of the *Millenium Falcon* reluctantly come along.

From there we can mostly just be derivative of the original movie, since things have been set into the exact same position they're in just after the *Millenium Falcon* leaves Tatooine. There are only a couple changes you'd have to make in order for it to work.

The *Falcon* travels to Alderaan, and gets there just after it's been blown up. The Death Star tractor beams up the *Falcon*, and while Obi-Wan goes to disable the tractor beam, Leia starts to snoop around in the Death Star's databanks. She finds out that Prince Luke is being held captive and suggests a rescue, and when Han asks why the hell they would risk their necks for that, she points out that while Alderaan has been destroyed, the Prince surely has access to an enormous amount of credits held off planet.

They eventually find Luke in his cell, where he explains the Death Star to them. They escape, Obi-wan has his battle with Vader before he can really explain anything, and Luke says that they have to go to Yavin IV. (During their harrowing escape, they pick up two droids that belong to Luke and hold sensitive data that's valuable to the resistance and hasn't yet been decrypted by the Empire.)

The rebels analyze the plans to the Death Star and find a strategic weakness - but unfortunately, there's no one that has the ability to shoot a torpedo that far down a narrow exhaust port. Without really thinking about it, Leia says that she knows Imperial security protocols well enough that she'd be able to make it down to the main reactor and sabotage it - but when it's suggested that she actually do this, she shakes her head and says it's a suicide mission.

Luke eventually talks her around to doing the right thing even at the cost of their lives. Leia agrees that it might just be possible to rig the reactor to explode from the inside and then escape before anyone knows they were there, and that's about when Han parts ways with the Rebellion and wishes them luck (because they'll need it). The *Falcon* has just left Yavin IV when the Death Star shows up, and though it's looking a lot less likely now, they decide to go ahead with their plan. Red Squadron is sent up to attack the Death Star, provide a distraction, and do some damage to the firing mechanism, while Luke, Leia, and R2D2 hop aboard a captured imperial ship to dock with the Death Star.

The plan goes south almost from the beginning. Luke and Leia end up battling their way through the Death Star with lightsabers drawn - Leia with blue and Luke with a red one stolen from Vader's collection (and R2D2 gets a few kills too by hacking their systems and slamming doors down on stormtroopers). Outside, Red Squadron is in a pitched battle to prevent the Death Star from firing, which isn't going well until the *Millenium Falcon* returns to the scene with a hail of turbolaser fire (C3PO was a stowaway on their ship, and gets a few kills on accident by randomly firing the lasers).

Luke fights off the stormtroopers with his Force powers (including, worryingly, Force lightning, which sets up character conflict for the sequel) while Leia works at the main reactor and rigs it to blow. Luke shouts that they're going to have to cut the fuse short if they want to prevent Yavin IV from being destroyed, Leia shouts back that she knows that, Luke says *really* short, and Leia shouts back that *she knows*. When she's finished, the countdown timer says ten minutes, which is clearly not enough time for them to escape.

Luke gets ready to say goodbye and go in for a last kiss, but Leia shoves him aside and runs down the hallway to where a ship repair/construction bay is located. She starts rigging up a hyperdrive with the help of R2D2. Luke looks confused and says that you can't go to hyperdrive from within something the size of a moon, and Leia responds that it's not that you *can't*, it's that you *really, really shouldn't*.

The *Falcon* is almost toast when Vader's ship suddenly starts retreating. Han lets out a whoop of satisfaction just before the Death Star explodes, and you can see his face start to fall when he realizes that Leia never signaled her escape. He starts frantically searching the comms frequencies and running his scanners at their highest settings, until eventually he finds an anomaly - a hyperdrive without a ship attached to it, two humanoid forms, and a small droid. He immediately pushes his engines as hard as they'll go, pulls them in, and finds Luke and Leia huddled together, wounded, frozen, and nearly dead from the exposure to hard vacuum.

The movie ends several weeks later when Leia comes limping out of a bacta tank and receives her reward along with the other heroes of the Battle of Yavin - but Vader is still out there somewhere, and Luke has been displaying some worrying signs of what Obi-wan said was the Dark Side."
OTMemes,foxtvbw,t1_foxnto1,1588156108.0,"I feel as though the destruction of a planet is morally reprehensible as it is the ultimate attempt at the complete destruction of an entire civilization and its people.  While the use of nuclear weapons is terrible Japanese society was able to rebuild itself within its native land after they were used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On the other hand, Alderaan was completely destroyed and survivors were persecuted; however, those who able to survive Alderaan's destruction and the subsequent persecution by The Empire were given a new Alderaan to call home. As a result, I see more direct parallels between Nazi Germany's perpetuation of genocide against the Jewish people who subsequently re-gained Israel as a homeland and the destruction of Aldreraan than I do between the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and said destruction despite the fact that The Holocaust was a long and terrible process while the destruction of Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Alderaan were instantaneous. While the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is defensible (I personally don't think it was the right choice) I do not believe that genocide, or the systematic destruction of a people and their culture, is. This is the foundation of my belief that the destruction of Alderaan cannot be morally defended.

Additionally, even if one believes that a show of force was necessary to stifle The Rebellion from The Empire's perspective that does not mean that said show of force needed to be at the level of planet wide destruction. Rogue one shows that the Death Star can destroy cities rather than planets and I do not see why Tarkin could not have blown up a city while also issuing an address stating that the weapon station that destroyed the city also has the capacity to destroy planets. I believe that this strategy would have inspired the same, or at least nearly the same, amount of fear of the empire as actually destroying a planet would have while also avoiding genocide and creating much less hatred for the empire amongst its inhabitants. Considering this, I believe that the destruction of Alderaan was not only morally reprehensible but was also foolish from a strategical perspective as well.

OurPresident,fkngyna,t1_fkmzjlf,1584365511.0,"Someone commented stating that we need to make territories states, partition blue states, and stack the Supreme  Court  in the future to combat the right under my comment above. I wrote a detailed response but that comment got deleted so I'm posting it here because I spent time writing my response and I'd rather not see my work wasted.

You are on the right track for sure since we only need a simple majority in Congress to add Justices and grant a territory statehood. I think you are reaching a bit too far though.

To start, I think going through the process of making territories such as Puerto Rico states would be a viable solution. I think that will definitely happen in the near future.

However, I doubt that partitioning states is realistic because I don't think that the average person wants their state to be partitioned unless there is an idealogical divide within the state. For example, I live in upstate New York and I've heard people complain about downstate NY and the influence it has over us but if we split NY we would most likely have two right leaning Senators and two left leaning Senators rather than just two left leaning ones. We certainly don't want that.

I also highly doubt that a solid blue state would partition itself due to the state's resident's having an interest in having the state joined due to the fact that splitting a state would lead to a lot of headaches and chaos. One half (or third, fourth, whatever) of the state would need a new capitol and both halves would need to completely restructure their government which is not an easy task. California might be an exception but I'm not holding my breath as a quick glance through google shows that parts of California are red.

I think it is ridiculous to suppose that we could stack the courts any time soon and have it end well for us. The democratic party is fragmented and I doubt that every representative with a D next their name is going to support stacking the courts. I know the congressman in my district won't or he'll likely be voted out. If it does work in the short term and the courts do get stacked in our favor there will likely be consequences. I think this tactic will energize conservatives even more and then we'll have a very fine mess.

We need to remember that public opinion is important. Most people don't care about politics enough to see the issues clearly so we need to tread carefully if we want to realize our goals. Sanders has managed to push the party to the left and I believe that this will continue even after his influence fades due to the rise of policians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. We do not need to panic and start playing with fire. We are just getting started.

Lastly, thank you for your comment. You made me do a lot of thinking and research in order to come up with an adequate response. Even if we both walk away in disagreement I know that I have left this conversation better off.

Edit: Additional point, If blue states want to partition themselves what's stopping red states?"

Political_Revolution,fhfb8n8,t1_fhf5uc6,1581539925.0,"I'm happy you gave an in depth response because I see your point more now, however, it does not seem as though EVERYONE wants to do something because there should not be 7 children dying in US custody considering we have a responsibility to care for them due to the fact that we took them from their parents. To me, it seems the main person not wanting to do something is the President and I see that as a problem. People dying needlessly in my country is something serious and that needs to be resolved. 

Additionally, I see two wrongs here that we are discussing. I see our involvement in the Middle East as the larger evil, just as you do, but that doesn't mean we should do nothing about the smaller evil if we can.

Lastly, regarding your main point I do take antipsychotics because I have bipolar disorder. That doesn't mean what I'm saying has no value. You seem intellegent but you are quite an ass because you are so willing to use mental illness as an insult which is really shitty.

Edit: grammar"
Political_Revolution,fherv66,t1_fhenuzc,1581528638.0,"So did I, but it is important to acknowledge that children are dying in cages needlessly on US soil which is not a hyperbole. Death is a necessary evil when it comes to war although I wouldn't say George W. Bush's Iraq War was neccesary by any means because it was declared illegally according to international law under false pretenses. Barrack Obama ran on getting out of the Middle East but did not when he entered office because he likely realized that it is quite difficult to humanely end a war once it's been started. 

On the other hand, taking proper care of children in a war-free state should be easy enough but it's not happening here and no amount of pressure on Trump seems to be changing that. Since there is no war happening on US soil there should be no reason for children under the supervision of the US government to be dying from preventable causes. It's sickening that you would lessen the deaths of children under US supervision by comparing these deaths to the necessary sacrifices that come with a war. 

For fuck's sake, I never would have imagined I would be arguing with people over whether needlessly letting children die in cages is something we need to do something about but here we are."

It may not be popular but I'm not about to say that the life of a starving free person is better than a well taken care of slave. I would also assume that in this example my master would be some sort of higher level life form than a human, perhaps a god, who would likely be able to care for me and guide me better than I can myself for parity's sake since we're assuming these ""slave"" animals are cared for by enlightened humans. My question for you is what would I be tangibly giving up if I get to have all of these things?

Frankly, based on your definition of slavery the Queen of England is a slave considering the obligations thrust upon her without her consent. I might rather be royalty than have the freedoms I have now. 

I also think undomesticated animals are slaves to nature just as domesticated animals are our slaves. Personally, if I had to choose between a master that will let me be literally EATEN ALIVE and another that would kill me in a more humane fashion I know which I would choose. 

Additionally, I think that our companion animals such as dogs and cats are also slaves based on this definition of yours and I think many of these animals (at least mine) are quite content with their arrangement as many times these animals can leave their home but they often seem to come back to their masters rather than tough it out in the wild enjoying their new found freedom until they inevitably get hit by a car or something.

The virtual reality idea IS an idea but maybe someday it can be more. You don't know what the future might hold and I think it's short sighted to not have an open mind. However, I do see how this idea could look idiotic based on our society's currently available resources.

In my opinion, the idea that every person will choose freedom over comfort is, quite frankly, idiotic whether we all want to admit it or not."

Also, just because a villain says drowning wolverine will work does not necessarily mean it will. I mean, Wolverine can die as Deadpool killed him in Deadpool kills the marvel universe but as Deadpool said before killing him he's too popular to actually die so his healing factor will just change depending on who is writing him in the 616 universe."
philosophy,fb55e76,t1_fb45v8q,1576521304.0,I would say that is true for people but I am unsure if that applies to animals as the most prominent defenses for animal life are utilitarian in nature. An act utilitarian would even say that killing innocent people could be a moral act if it ends up maximizing happiness for everyone. I'm not a utilitarian but I  think it is important to consider needless suffering objectionable. I do not see any reason why we shouldn't eat animals if we could do so in a humane and sustainable way that considers the happiness of the animals we eat. I'm not sure if this can be done but if it can I believe eating meat should be fine.

I believe that suppression of speech also occurred during the Civil War as well as Lincoln limited speech that might damage the war effort.

Additionally, free speech was further restricted in numerous court cases throughout the early 20th century. I think the most prominent of these case's is Dennis V. US. While argument the justices made in this case was good which was that Free speech does not allow advocating overthrow of the government. The reality was that Dennis and others were no threat to the US and the government just wanted the power to bash on socialists, who as Bernie Sanders has shown, can be willing to push their ideaology peacefully.

It seems to me that you are looking at the past through rose colored glasses. I would venture to say that we have MORE free speech now than we have had in the past in practice but I think it's clear that we are not following a literal interpretation of the first ammendemt. 

Even so, things are better now for all citizens when it comes to speech because we have legal precedents that clarify exactly how far free speech extends which allows citizens to arm themselves with knowledge."

According to polls from March 1965 34% held the view that integration was moving too quickly, and by May that sentiment rose to 45%, with only 14% expressing the view that it was not moving fast enough. ""By a margin of 61% to 21%, Southerners felt the government was moving too quickly, rather than about right. Outside the South, Americans were about evenly divided: About four-in-ten thought the pace was too fast and about the same percentage thought integration was occurring at about the right pace. "". I think that any form of moderation between ""White Citizens' Counciler or the Klu Klux Klan"" and supporting the enforcement of a just law created to ensure civil equality is still a form racism because endorsing anything less forces you to admit that you view racial equality as an afterthought in your political calculus which I think is pretty fucked up to do when you consider US history.

HistoryMemes,etwj4p4,t1_etuk0dt,1563273053.0,"I think you are correct but an able bodied person can be a gifted engineer, a genius tactician, or carry a resistance to an illness as well. Back in Ancient Greece there were specific traits that were clearly more advantageous to have considering that the Greeks existed within a culture that glorified war and combat. I don't think most people in Ancient Greece would choose to have a disabled child when they can wait to have another able bodied child in the future without caring for an investment (very cruel terminology but I think this is how people viewed their children a large extent in the past) that is less likely to pay off.

Aristotle said that  ""As to the exposure of children, let there be a law that no deformed child shall live.”[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infanticide#cite_note-27) which seems to indicate that this practice was widespread as Aristotle was educated in Athens. Even today people select for certain traits in their future children by aborting children with severe disabilities such as down's syndrome so this practice hasn't truly been eliminated rather it seems to have evolved to better suit our modern sensibilities concerning infanticide and disability.

As a person with a disability, I am very happy we do not live in this kind of world anymore because our pluralistic society accommodates for disability so that we can meaningfully contribute to society in ways that other people likely would not be able to. However, while I think it is reasonable to believe that society benefits from disabled individuals, in Ancient Greece that probably did not matter as much to the parents who would end up bearing the burdens of a disabled child because they would get no form of social assistance to help their child fully participate as an equal member of society."

I think Bernie Sanders is great and I voted for him in the 2016 primary but I'm not sure if he will win because I think the best way to beat Trump is to have a well formulated plan rather than big ideas without any specifics. I don't think that getting big money out of politics is our biggest concern when we have Trump in office and we need to prioritize. It might be possible to do both but I'd rather focus on the issue of super PACs when we're done cleaning Trump's mess and resolve human rights violations he committed because that should be our priority considering how many lives are being threatened by him being in power.

I don't think trade deals are intrinsically bad for the US we just need adequate taxation so that the benefits of trade deals spread throughout the US population rather than keeping it concentrated in the hands of the wealthy."
HistoryMemes,et0spvs,t1_et0pdmb,1562385532.0,"I completely agree. I simplified how much each state assisted one another because I am not an expert on WWII. The US troops definitely made a significant difference but I don't think that was the most prominent way the US helped their allys considering how important the supplies they provided were. 

I think the Allies needed the military support of the US to win the war but that should not detract from the significant contributions and sacrifices of the UK and USSR. I think the belief that the US carried WWII is dangerous because it feeds into nationalism but that isn't to say US citizens shouldn't be proud of their country's accomplishments. It is just that that pride should come from a critical understanding of the part we played in WWII rather than uncritically boasting."
HistoryMemes,et0jvqw,t1_et03wvt,1562380481.0,"As an American would venture to say the stereotype has been pretty accurate the past 3 or so years unfortunately.

Edit- Not all Americans are this way but I think Trump has made the one's who are bolder and brasher. We need change to move our country forward and this will probably take decades to fully achieve."
HistoryMemes,et0iwkp,t1_et0fqck,1562379978.0,"It was a fucking team effort. The UK, The USSR, and the US all meaningfully contributed in distinct ways with the UK providing tech, the USSR providing bodies, and the US providing food and raw materials. Any other view is just nationalism pure and simple. SMH at France tho.

Edit- This only relates to the European Theater as the US clearly did carry the Pacific Theater."
bipolar,et0ifi3,t3_c9mqwl,1562379731.0,I feel this so much. No one seems to understand and then when shit hits the fan you'r at the mercy of whoever has power over you. It makes everythimg harder for everyone.
AskReddit,et0gsxq,t3_c9jp3g,1562378897.0,I found Super Mario World in my parent's garage from when they first got married. It's still my favorite game today.
HistoryMemes,et0cku0,t1_esyriz0,1562376614.0,"After reading about France in my college courses and in the news my opinion is that the French are very entitled. That's not necessarily a bad thing because the entitled government is constantly fighting with an entitled people and that results in actual progress for everyone but I don't think it's the most efficient system. 

It seems to me that the US has the opposite problem where stuff gets done efficiently but so many people are brainwashed, boot licking, boot strap pullers that the majority of the people do not benefit from this efficiency and are actively harmed by it. 

Edit- Changed some stuff around to reflect my views better"
bipolar,erfsdn2,t3_c1ndgp,1560816625.0,I still have friends but the distance between us grows each day as they lose the willingness and then the ability to relate to me. They're not bad people but I guess it's hard for everyone to deal with. I just try to remember that life changes things but if I am strong I can adapt and make a difference.
AskReddit,eqy8yxp,t3_bzr3br,1560379361.0,The Edge Chronicles was the first series I really got into. I really liked how it followed a family at different points in time within a dark and mystical world.
bipolar,eqxhdkx,t3_bzm5mk,1560369367.0,I identify with this sooooo much.
todayilearned,eoxrvxf,t1_eoxhppn,1558928110.0," I just want to say that, intentional or not if it got to that point it already was genocide if we view genocide as a process. This is because the British would have been discriminating against the Irish by starving them to death and not giving assistance even though they were capable of providing aid. They may have also been dehumanizing the Irish and probably everyone who wasn't British or European but I'm not sure to what extent.
