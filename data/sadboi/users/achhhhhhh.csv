depressionregimens,fqzdmy2,t1_fqz6hlz,1589765166.0,"Same, hydroxyzine works pretty well for me and doesn’t make me feel brain dead"
StopSelfHarm,fqzd6ba,t3_glnvc0,1589764892.0,"Yeah I’m 22 and started at 18, I constantly feel like I’m too old to be self harming and it makes me scared to open up to people in my life that still don’t know."
mentalillness,fqyz4j9,t3_gljydc,1589757051.0,"I get this a lot and the biggest thing that has helped slow the thoughts down has been just writing whatever thoughts come into my head. I empty the contents of my brain onto paper so my brain can stop fixating on things. It kinda feels like once I have everything written on paper, I can come back to those thoughts at another time. I write until my brain has run out of thoughts. Most of my writing is all over the place and doesn’t make sense, but it gets the chaos out of my brain."
depressed,fqvfeac,t3_gl0qk5,1589676112.0,"Ahhh this is me!!! The only form of intimacy I can do is drunk hookups with strangers or people I hardly ever see, anything more than that causes me debilitating anxiety. I cannot do anything beyond casual sex but even that sends me into a self-hating downward spiral. I’m scared of people getting to actually know me. I can’t even make close friends anymore. I hate it so much, I’ve basically given up."
depression,fqvduch,t3_gl1gne,1589675171.0,I do this. I feel like my depression doesn’t really make sense because I’ve had a pretty privileged life and I don’t have any history of mental illness in my family. So if my depression didn’t come from genetics or trauma where the fuck did it come from?
AnxietyDepression,fqvdhc1,t1_fqvd6pz,1589674958.0,happy to help! Oh and also (sorry lol) maybe it’d be better to ask qs about individual parents instead of both of them - I have a great relationship with one and a terrible relationship with the other
AnxietyDepression,fqvcqj5,t3_gl2yzs,1589674510.0,"Hey I did the survey - just so your friend knows, I think they might want to change the last page where it asks about coronavirus causing depression and anxiety and then asks you to rate it. I couldn’t really give an accurate answer bc while coronavirus hasn’t helped my mental health, I’m coming out of a severe depressive episode from earlier this year and corona virus hasn’t been the main cause of my depression/anxiety. Maybe it could be rephrased to ask whether the virus had ‘exacerbated’ anxiety/depression instead of ‘caused’?"
AdultSelfHarm,fqv5nh8,t3_gkygpq,1589670359.0,"Oh yeah, I get this. Sometimes it just doesn’t feel as good as it did in the past, like it didnt work like it used to. Sometimes I’m just disappointed because I feel like my cuts aren’t bad enough."
StopSelfHarm,fqsei8w,t1_fqqltwd,1589605124.0,"I’ve honestly gotten more out of group therapy than normal therapy. I was in intensive group therapy for two months coming out of the hospital and it was the most validating thing. Group therapy is mostly just normal people talking about our struggles and supporting/helping each other out with our mental health.

I felt like I could relate to others for the first time in years, and actually be useful for once. And it’s just nice being able to talk about your problems to people who are dealing with the same shit. It just feels so productive and open and supportive. Group therapy is just normal people talking and helping each other out with their own problems."
depression,fqr6nge,t1_fqqo2nr,1589578585.0,"man I feel this so deeply. Like I want to give up my life and physical body to someone else who’d make way better use of it than I ever could. 

I’ve been given so much and I’ve wasted everything and every opportunity I’ve ever been given. It’s really not fair to the tons of people who’d kill for the privileged life that I didn’t even need to work for."

DiagnoseMe,fq52rl8,t1_fptxwwd,1589090717.0,Dude you get plantar warts from being barefoot in a public place (especially changing rooms/showers)
DiagnoseMe,fq50moo,t3_gg5tbt,1589088950.0,"It sounds like most of your problems are caused by or exacerbated by anxiety. Prolonged anxiety can cause muscle stiffness, your body tenses up more when anxious causing sore muscles and aches. When my anxiety gets worse I am also just more aware/bothered by pain and aches. 

Anxiety also causes insomnia (which means poor rest so you would be fatigued during the day, as well as brain fog and watery eyes), as well as poor concentration and lack of motivation. 

NAD, but to me it sounds like you just have TMJ and anxiety."
DiagnoseMe,fq4zpx1,t3_gg67tu,1589088236.0,NAD but this really sounds like endometriosis

Anxiety,fptbt9q,t3_gf7ars,1588888393.0,"When I’m really anxious the only thing I’ll really be able to eat without feeling nauseous is saltines. The plainer the food the better. And just eating a few throughout the day is easier than meals, when I’m really struggling to eat it’s better than nothing."
SelfHarmScars,fphg008,t3_gd9eqw,1588620618.0,I know I don’t know you but I’m proud of you x
SuicideWatch,fphe54e,t3_gdbc8j,1588619669.0,"Maybe you’re friends felt just felt powerless, like they wouldn’t be able to help. They could have been overwhelmed - it can be pretty scary when you see a friend struggling so much but there’s nothing you can really do to help except being with them and seeing them fall apart. Avoidance is defense mechanism. That said, they’re still being shitty by ghosting you. I’m really sorry for what you’re going through, I’ve been there and it hurts so much."
depression,fpf7uw1,t1_fpdkfaq,1588563903.0,lol I literally just had a dream about trying to convince everyone to let me die so I can donate all my organs.
AnxietyDepression,fpdnfng,t3_gcudpz,1588530448.0,"Sometimes I kinda just wanna remove my brain from my head, throw it against the ground and fucking stomp and whack the depression and anxiety out of it."
depression,fpdn37z,t1_fpdfarr,1588530251.0,"I couldn’t agree more. Especially with chronic depression - time isn’t going to do shit unless you work to accept and actively to address the problems contributing to your mental illness. 

Like accepting a defeatist mentality really just makes things worse, if I’m not even trying to work against it I just fall into a deep suicidal hole."
selfharm,fpdm85d,t3_gcsiqb,1588529758.0,"Same, I turned 22 a month ago and still cutting :( 
I went into another bad depressive episode at the end of last year and started again after being clean for like almost 2 years. I’m honestly kinda embarrassed though because I started cutting so much later than most people... I started when I was 18 and it honestly was never a regular thing until this year. I guess I’ve just been getting more and more hopeless the older I get."
depression,fpdknoo,t1_fpddoup,1588528868.0,"Me fucking too. I honestly thought college would be great and easier than high school and I’d finally find my thing and my people but nahhh now I’m a 6 year student with a C grade average, no friends, and a career path that’ll fuck me over. I’ve failed out, redid freshman year, and now I’m taking a year medical leave after being hospitalized hahah."
SuicideWatch,fpacqn8,t3_gc5dro,1588445452.0,I don’t bc I’ll still be my shitty self lol

unpopularopinion,fotah1t,t1_foqr79z,1588048524.0,"It’s honestly fucking insane to me that in a show that says it’s trying to promote mental health awareness, not a single character even talks about Hannah’s depression and the fact that maybe her depression was a reason for her suicide..... like come on really"
mentalhealth,foscnes,t3_g98dk7,1588028113.0,"It sounds like you have a pretty healthy range of emotions. If you’re feeling constantly down for days or weeks on end then something might be wrong, but this sounds completely normal."
mentalillness,foruepk,t3_g96s3n,1588018688.0,"It sounds like you’re dissociating, it can feel like the world isn’t real and everyone around you are actors and sometimes you don’t recognize yourself and you can feel like your body isn’t yours if that makes sense? It really sucks but it can definitely happen with bad anxiety. It’s your brain’s way of trying to cope when everything gets way too overwhelming and you feel like you’re under threat. detaching makes it less real. Sometimes it’s called depersonalization/derealization. I hope things get better for you."
SuicideWatch,forrs9w,t1_forppee,1588017381.0,Trazodone made my sleep so fucking bad. I would wake up to every tiny sound and I would literally get 30 mins sleep max in a night. I was told it was supposed to knock me out lmao
depressionregimens,fopbxtw,t3_g8qv54,1587957703.0,"I started on XL for like 2 and a half weeks before switching to SR. The XL gave me more anxiety and made me more agitated for some reason. I changed to SR though because I could split up my dosage to twice a day which really helped with some of the side effects, the anxiety didn’t hit me as hard. I did feel worse for like 2 weeks before feeling better, but Wellbutrin really helped with my lethargy and gave me back my energy. But that said, if Wellbutrin is making you feel more suicidal and unstable you should definitely talk to you psychiatrist."
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,foo2v29,t3_g7uah2,1587931422.0,wow ok trans genocide here we go i guess
AnxietyDepression,foo146r,t1_fonzjxa,1587930439.0,Yeah it’s really hard. And I feel so alienated because of it which just makes me want to withdraw more. I’ve been really lucky though and found friends in people that also have mental health problems. I’ve actually realized that all of the close friends I’ve had in my life have suffered from mental health weirdly enough
depression,foo0mx9,t1_folknmn,1587930173.0,"Thank you so much, just knowing that people understand helps me not beat myself up so much. I was thinking I should look into classes maybe, or learn a language or whatever. I’ve finally got some motivation back so hopefully I can start to find ways to be productive again."

AnxietyDepression,folw218,t3_g86pw3,1587871852.0,"I honestly have lost a lot of friends from isolating myself from depression. I stopped meeting up with people as much, and they just stopped inviting me out.  I actually brought it up with a friend one time when she didn’t invite me to a hangout, and she said she just assumed I wasn’t interested because Id declined other invites in the past.
Personally, I don’t blame them. But it really sucks. My mental health has turned me into a hermit for the last year. It did really hurt when my friends stopped asking me out to places though. That friend I talked to knows now so she’s started inviting me over again, and she’s been pretty good with checking in with me otherwise. I just think talking to my closer friends (at least) about it helped for me."
selfharm,folutzj,t3_g7t5od,1587871009.0,Oh man I used to get that all the fuckin time but my meds won’t even let me feel horny anymore 😠
AnxietyDepression,folrjuz,t3_g804tl,1587868801.0,"I took the same dose of Quetiapine for a while, also for anxiety. It hardly did anything for my anxiety symptoms, but it always made my mood worse and I would never want to talk or be around people because I would just feel drained. I’m taking hydroxyzine now instead and it works so much better for me."
ADHD,foeg4la,t3_g6jo4z,1587702933.0,I’ve been on Wellbutrin for a few months. I had a really hard time sleeping the first week but it got mostly better after that for me.
ADHD,foeagrw,t3_g6brtx,1587699337.0,Ugh I did this with dinner today but instead of 2 1/2 hours I binge scrolled on reddit for 5 1/2 hours and I really hate myself now.
ADHD,foe3uya,t3_g6rtpc,1587695493.0,"lol sorry in advance for the essay. I was just diagnosed last year, at 21. I wanted to get tested for years but I couldn’t find the time/ didn’t know how - but mostly I would be super motivated to look into testing for a bit but then forget about it/down play everything. I told my parents about feeling like I had it but they didn’t want to help. 

I guess I first knew that something was off in primary school (when I was like 8 or 9 I think), around the time teachers started giving us homework. 

I could never really just sit down and get my work done in one go and in a normal amount of time. Everything at school took longer for me, even though teachers knew I was bright. I was always the last person to finish class work. I almost never finished timed exams or quizzes. I saw all my classmates focus on things so effortlessly and do all of their homework without any problems and I never understood why I couldn’t do the same. 

My teachers would get mad at me for consistently not finishing my work even though I really wanted to. They could see that I was smart and capable of doing well but I felt like I was always disappointing them. Every single school report said that I was “clearly bright” but that my work was “inconsistent” and that I needed to “engage more” and put in more effort. Oh my god the amount of times that I’ve been told by teachers “you haven’t been living up to your potential”.... It was so demoralizing and frustrating because I really did try.

I started to realize that other students that weren’t naturally as smart were able to study hard enough and do well. I was able to help explain concepts and things to others in class but then those same students I helped would outperform me in exams.

Other than that in college it would take me like 6 hours to write a one page paper every week because I could never order my thoughts in a logical way. I would always forget what point I was leading up to when writing essays and my brain could never stay on task. I could never filter out the relevant bits.

I constantly have mental blocks and it takes me a stupidly long amount of time to start things. I never finish anything. I can also compulsively procrastinate to the point where I’ve lost 6 hours without moving or looking up from my phone. Every one I know knows that I am a complete mess of a person."
depressionregimens,fod6odc,t3_g5a21d,1587680819.0,"I’ve definitely had periods of derealization but mine haven’t happened Wellbutrin so far (and I’ve been drinking way too much caffeine lol) - but that’s just me personally. I feel like my derealization comes more from depression with heightened anxiety and stress.

I’ll start to feel like the world is fake and everything looks like a weird movie set. My body won’t feel like mine anymore and like it’s moving on it’s own, and I kinda get what you mean by feeling giddy - I felt like i was really hyper aware of everything around me but weirdly calm even though I knew how freaky it all was. It felt like I was floating everywhere. And everything was so clear and sharp and focused but in a fake way? Proportions of everything in my environment look wrong or 2D, definitely like a video game. Everything felt kind of 2D, like even sounds and other senses. It feels like I’m going crazy but I’m so aware of it all happening.

It’s really odd but I felt weirdly indestructible and numb because of how fake the world felt. And even though it was scary it was kind of nice in a way because of how disconnected I was. My emotions didn’t really work, they were super flat and it honestly was pretty funny to me sometimes."
depressionregimens,fod2g6h,t3_g6rtt5,1587679011.0,"I don’t know how useful this is because I mostly just smoke weed, but CBD and weed have really helped me survive in the short term when my days get really difficult to handle. Weed kept me away from alcohol and other substances and it calms me down enough to get to sleep. I’ve also noticed that I really tend to sleep through the night when I smoke weed or take cbd. 

CBD is definitely calming but it really is a temporary solution so I would keep that in mind. But otherwise CBD is really worth trying, especially for anxiety, because there aren’t really any bad side effects.

I’m also on Wellbutrin and just started Zoloft. In terms of interactions (if that’s something you’re worried about) CBD doesn’t really interact much with anything. It’s pretty harmless."
SuicideWatch,fod07va,t3_g6pal6,1587678209.0,"I really relate to this. I honestly take procrastination to a whole new level. I’m not sure if anyone in my life can relate to how bad it gets for me. The guilt is so overwhelming. The longer I put something off the more impossible the task seems and a lot of the time I just abandon shit completely. Over the last few years I’ve failed big exams, failed out of school and was hospitalized for being suicidal because of it."
