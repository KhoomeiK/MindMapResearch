bipolar,fgykf50,t1_fgyjq0h,1581184196.0,Thanks! I will.
bipolar,fgy27ty,t1_fgxv4lm,1581178758.0,This isn't right. My diagnosis was April last year. It's turned everything upside down.
bipolar,fgxrfzg,t1_fgxq5i5,1581175874.0,That can't be legal? Have you talked to an attorney?
bipolar,fgxnwz7,t3_f0ppvp,1581174801.0,"This hits me hard. I used to be incredibly responsible and had it all together. After a severe manic episode, I felt like I'd regressed to a 12 year old. I'm getting a lil better, but definitely feel like a teenager. I'm 29 :-("
bipolar,f5tsmg1,t3_dp6czz,1572463742.0,Breathe ‚ù§Ô∏è
bipolar,f4vmu5p,t3_dlqjyx,1571844795.0,I would hang this up in a heartbeat!
bipolar,f4rdxba,t3_dlhta6,1571766250.0,So beautiful yet unsettling. Amazing!
bipolar,f4nxrm7,t3_dl63a0,1571694133.0,I've noticed my diet has been much worse since I got my diagnosis earlier this year. But my life has been completely turned upside down since then and I use food as a comfort.

bipolar,f44xqms,t1_f44txjp,1571361223.0,Thank you! I'm lucky to have found a good psych in my area. Still working on my meds cocktail and staying away from social media. I finished my first book in over a year yesterday. Working on the diet and I may take down my Bumble account.
bipolar,f44ws6h,t1_f44frd0,1571360582.0,Starting over is the worst thing about all this. I'm also struggling with the job situation. I had a great career before this happened to me and I've been out of work for six months. Very frustrating.
bipolar,f446vye,t1_f43zw1w,1571348697.0,That is near verbatim what happened to me. My social media posts were out of control. I believed I was psychic and clairvoyant and thought I was receiving messages and signs from my dead grandparents. I'm still so ashamed and embarrassed and struggle with rumination everyday.
bipolar,f43se4v,t1_f43od6a,1571344675.0,"Thanks. It's been really rough. I feel like I just ran to living with my parents without thinking it through first. They have the most toxic relationship ever. But like you, it felt like hell out there too. And it's too late to turn back. Remember that you absolutely deserve the space that you're in."
bipolar,f43krk4,t1_f43j6j9,1571342736.0,Thank you. I've been counting backwards from 10 a lot these days.
bipolar,f43f9pa,t1_f43bxg4,1571341350.0,I hope talk therapy helps. I'm jealous you're living on your own. Although you need your parents' help it's good you have that independence and it's nice to have your own space.
bipolar,f43dzfo,t1_f43brcw,1571341038.0,Thank you! Luckily there's one self help group in my area. It's small and doesn't seem to help much but I'm going.
bipolar,f439q6j,t1_f436f9k,1571339848.0,"Now I'm crying! I feel getting through hour by hour. I miss the psych ward.... Mostly because I was hypomanic and hopeful the entire time I was there, and the camaraderie. It's so hard living so far away from that support group (I had to move out of state to live with my parents). It just sucks."
