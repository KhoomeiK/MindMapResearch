cyclothymia,ficxvzh,t3_f7hpuh,1582359237.0,"Hey! I get the exact same thing, so I can only imagine it is part of the disorder. Just as you, it's gonna be sometimes self destructive thoughts, sometimes it will be an image that I can't get out of my head & that drives me crazy (one time I got obsessed with the idea of my significant other kissing their ex whereas they've NEVER cheated on me, but it was just my mind spinning out of control). Maybe talk to your doctor about it? Maybe they will be capable to give you coping keys to make you feel better during these moments, cause I know they're a great source of anxiety."

cyclothymia,fhklu1l,t3_f3r92o,1581686551.0,"Oh wow it is so variable. By ""stage"", do you mean √©pisode? Because if you do, for me hypomanic episodes typically last 4-5 days to a week, & depressive episodes 1 to 3 months. 
But apart from that, I used to swing from one extreme mood to another SEVERAL TIMES a day. Luckily since I've been on Abilify & Lamictal, stability is back!"

bipolar,fggcumy,t1_fgef98s,1580759184.0,Good luck with that. Don't hesitate to ask all your questions to the doctor because sometimes they don't say everything but if you do ask they will answer without a problem! It's very important.

bipolar,f89dadw,t1_f89bwlh,1574371146.0,Yeah & that's probably the case! But the problem is sometimes this anxiety gets so severe that I suddenly start thinking I'm not bipolar & that I have lied to the doctors & that I manipulated everyone into believing it etc...
bipolar,f89d33e,t1_f89c1mb,1574371052.0,That's where I'm stuck when I think about it. I guess it's self-sabotage? But i'm not sure.
