I have a daytime splint (forgot the name, but I eat with it and wear it at all times) and nighttime binator.

I love my dentist but would love your feedback, since you sound very knowledgeable."
TMJ,fhkvsm2,t1_fhki1ma,1581692115.0,"I had/have similar issues.

TMJ,fhjdo7n,t3_f3k8ez,1581643618.0,"TMJ specialist for a TMJ makes the most sense, doesn‚Äôt it? Those are usually orthodontists, dentists, or periodontists. If someone tries to talk you into a surgery right off the bat, run for the hills.
