I should be grateful of what I have. And I am. But I freaking don;t want to live. I don't want to be an adult. I don't want to be in work, in life, waking up every morning and sleeping every night. I don't want to set my own house and set my own things and raise my children. I don't want to have useless chats with people. I'd rather be asleep after all."
