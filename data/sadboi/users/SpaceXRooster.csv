She looks young enough that it’s hard for people to tell unless they explicitly ask what our ages are, which doesn’t happen. I always liked the idea of being younger in a relationship because it eases up the responsibility a little bit. It feels to me in a way like she might be my personal nurse who lets me stay at her apartment and enjoys doing fun things with me before bed. Dating an older woman to me is a mutual feeling. She enjoys my youth and energy and I enjoy her years of cooking experience put into each meal."

RoastMe,ffcof50,t1_ffco4o0,1579803784.0,Thanks for wishing me luck. I actually have just broken through with my sleep insomnia. Losing sleep has been my issue. When I can’t sleep for days or weeks then I begin to lose my head. But I am finally on a good dose of medication that allows me to get the sleep I need and when I wake up I don’t feel groggy or tired or lacking in concentration. Soon I will be starting work at the airport in my city. Life is looking up for me now. Which is why I decided to get roasted. Cheers! 😊
