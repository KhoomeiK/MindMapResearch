Also, if she is encouraging for you to repress things instead of dealing with them properly, it usually just keeps making things worse.

Dealing with something properly is never lost time. Rushing a person on therapy or to repress past trauma is usually a bad and unhealthy thing. It can even add physical health problems into the mix.

You can care about your mother but that does not mean she is correct in this sort of thing. Her response sounds like what I would expect out of a teenager. I would be very cautious or completely cut off her ability to be involved in a private matter.

Ask her if she would be comfortable driving on the highway in an improperly or uninsured vehicle that has also not been safetied properly. Would you let her do that to you or your wife? No?

Your relationship is between yourself and your wife. Not your mother. You might as well get a divorce now if you are the type of man who neglected to handle this part of your life properly.

Your grandfathers life experiences have nothing to do with this. What traumatises a person varies. You sound like a child and not a friend. I do not think you are being honest at all. 

You saying something is a charade does not make it so. Often, people who go out of their way to start drama will try to pin it on another person by nitpicking or trying to micromanage someone else. Or by triangulating an outsider into their manufactured drama so they can try to blame that person when things go badly. It sounds like you tried to do this to another person and are looking to have your poor behaviour validated by trying to whine about your scapegoat not fitting their scapegoat role for you in the way you prefer. 

You do not know this person's actual life history. What people tell you about is often a very small part of their life of they are forced to lie to cover up abuse. Sometimes to a point where they are not even able to acknowledge that they are lying.

You probably haven't the slightest clue what you are talking about here. You have the option to be a decent person and realise that people make mistakes, yourself included. 

People often get caught up in trying to figure out trauma and health issues when they are not given access to therapy and a safe, healthy living environment when they need it. Or the people who abuse them will keep them from health care. 

I am sorry that you were not making friends when you were in a good place and a person you claim to be the friend of had yet to receive appropriate health care that allowed them to make friends from a good place.

Some of the stuff you state as just being ""hard"" may actually be more than that.

Sometimes people try to help and because of lack of awareness or training in some things, they make things much worse while lamenting how things bother them. You are upset. Understandable. Patience, experience and education is much more important sometimes. 

I am not against or for any particular gender but in my experiences women seem to be more comfortable putting people they claim to care about at high risk when they think they are helping.

People who do this damage to others often think they have the right (when they do not) to interfere with someone getting to an actual, relevant, appropriate therapist. Why? Probably because they are vain, negligent, narcissistic, greedy, bad at what they do and want to keep you from reporting them.

I'm really sorry this happened to you. If it helps now, as you are speaking to someone appropriate, try to think ""I left the farm"" or something similar that works for you. It can help you build up trust with yourself and what you are going through in CPTSD therapy.

It can help you to not allow for anyone near you who tries to gaslight that sort of dialogue onto you. I had to speak to professionals in order to get the false dialogues and gaslighting out of my system because of my exposure to this sort of health care fraud. It's hard and takes time. It's awful. You are not the only one. I hope you start feeling better. 

What was done to you was inhumane. That is why I like the ""I left the farm"" mentality. It acknowledges how people were put in positions of trust who could not be trusted with people's health care and well-being. They were not in health care, they were in farming. Farmers are not allowed to be involved in the health care of human beings.

I have gone through a period of time where recovering from this sort of negligence did make me feel like I had yet to make it to a self-actualised human state. Starting to feel things you were gaslit and silenced on might be the norm for you for a bit. I felt like a piece of construction equipment in getting the word out on this sort of negligence.

If you are willing to take action at any point, try to remember that there are other people and professionals that try to keep an eye on these sorts of things and do what they can, but they cannot always take action quickly. Take care of yourself first. Do not do anything until you are ready, but do not assume you will not be taken seriously or that these sorts of things go unnoticed."

TrueOffMyChest,fn4z3g6,t1_fn4sg5s,1586652146.0,Sorry to hear. I said that because there are people who will create realistic looking fakes as part of a scam when faking deaths. I'm sorry about your loss. Just because photos of bodies can be faked does not mean I should take my scepticism out on you. I am dealing with a lot of shit and it has me wanting to confront other people who may not know if they are as well.

ptsd,fmweuz7,t3_fxnjlj,1586445318.0,"This attitude is enabling and unhealthy. It is vestiges of the shitty grooming approach that you are acknowledging was wrong. You are continuing to brainwash yourself for them. It was bad, it was not beautiful. The healthiest thing you can do for yourself is recognise this for the bullshit that it is and cut it out.

This is not you speaking, this is you allowing that abuse to keep making excuses for things that should not have happened to you and you did not choose. You are still showing behaviours of enmeshment. From the outside, it's gross."
TrueOffMyChest,fmjqws8,t1_fmjna5b,1586135882.0,"I am learning language and getting professional help. I developed the ""skill"" of disassociating from some of the things I listed because it was the only option. I was prevented from telling anyone or these things were normalised.

As I get professional help and learn language, I am able to remember and translate. Professional help advises what I can do and how to go about it. Unfortunately, because I was forced into disassociating so young I am not sure how useful what I translate will be to media and authorities.

Being able to practice the language I learn and speaking to people helps me develop as a person. It helps me contextualise a life I never chose."

CPTSD,flo46xq,t1_flo1uqd,1585331296.0,"Multi Level Marketing. They can be hard to notice if they occur in environments where the person involving you in it does not seem like they are part of one. 

Some people know them as pyramid schemes. You will get gobbly gook (see: nonsensical, fishy, unethical ""business"" jargon) from people who are part of or have been around this kind of stuff. It's cult-like and shitty.

""Time share"" is another unethical type of approach. Your therapist has said things to you where they have spoke to you as though you were part of a ""time share"" scam with them instead of a therapist and a client. 

I do not know your personal experience but it sounds like they were trying to hide a ""time share"" scam approach to therapy because they were not a professional. Your therapy isn't a movie, game, book or television show and your therapist was unethical in trying to approach it in that manner.

I am familiar with people trying to rewrite or gaslight a person into saying something else has gone on. It is something I have been around my entire life. In fact, I have only very recently been around less of these behaviours.

Therapy that lacks ethics isn't therapy, just farce. Farce doesn't count.

Some of the things you described from this therapist are behaviours you can sometimes see in people that are involved in MLM schemes. There is crossover with the behaviour you are describing and the unethical behaviour MLM schemes enable or encourage. 

Your therapist may have had this sort of behaviour towards people normalised, which is where they thought it was acceptable behaviour towards your person when you needed to speak to a professional.

Some people are conditioned to behave this way or to enable others to behave this way. I'm really sorry you had this happen."
CPTSD,flncf2r,t3_fpp8hw,1585315380.0,"If you can and feel comfortable doing so, maybe try to do something about this. I have encountered someone who showed similar behaviours and they were just part of an MLM scam that tries to keep professionals from getting involved."
