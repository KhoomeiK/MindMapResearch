This one time, a tiny pregnant woman led my mom and I behind a curtain, up a flight of stairs (that did not look up to code), down a hallway and into a room.  When she opened the door for us.. my face lit up. It was purse Narnia. The whole room was filled with wall shelves of reps. Keep in mind I knew NOTHING about QC‚Äôing back then. So, PVC was my jam. Goodness. I may have pictures of them that I can dig up for fun. Then, we discovered the vendors at the flea market down in New Haven. We would make the drive there and hope it wasn‚Äôt a weekend the police were patrolling for purses.
