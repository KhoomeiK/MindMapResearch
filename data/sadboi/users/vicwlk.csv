My hair never sheds in the shower and i wash almost daily with a sulfate shampoo and my hair was just coming out and i have thick 3c/4a hair. Then i had respiratory issues and EXTREME itching and had to wash my hair and face in a wawa sink travelling from PA to VA by car bc i felt miserable until i did so. Not even zyrtec helped so i don't think it was an allergic reaction bc zyrtec always works immediatelyfor me as I'mallergic to my pets and get itchy hives and sneezing from them. My daughter didn't get the respiratory or itching effects but both of us loss some curl pattern and hair with one use of decadence and and a no poo kit i bought from ulta. I also noticed relaxer ingredients in there coconut elongater ... my daughter's, dad's, fiance uses it and my daughter says her hair is very thin but that could just be her hair. 

After 1 use i had to trim an inch of my ends off ... i cut my hair down to 2 inches in feb 2019 and I'm now at 12-13 inches so that really pissed me off. 

Deva curl, kinky curly (except their edge control), camille rose, shea moisture are all GARBAGE!

My daughter likes Amika and it does amazing things for our hair but i have similar respiratory issues and itching with it but no hair breakage. 

My scalp and face gets very oily so the product could be dripping into my eyes and i use chemical peels so it could be getting into my blood stream causing issues also, who knows ... i only use water, bed head and davines now"
narcissism,fc7ifra,t1_fc7h1us,1577508418.0,"well, because you consider yourself a narcissist but it seems like you were just trying to fit in just like my daughter. I guess i was looking for a discussion about learned narcissistic behaviors vs a true brain disorder that causes narcissist personality traits and ended up with a bunch of personal stories and honestly of everyone that responded I only think one of you is a true narcissist and the rest of you really need to be because you've connected with that identity. If that is rude, I apologize because that's not my aim."

narcissism,fc7hkv5,t1_fc7gt3t,1577507664.0,"well, my question was about learned narcissistic / victim behaviors from childhood and that wasn't addressed in your comment so I added an example to further explain what it is that I am questioning. That's all. I can tell by these responses that most people on reddit aren't true narcissist. My friend's daughter who is high functioning and on the autism spectrum and has severe OCD genuinely cannot process social cues, understand empathy or control her thoughts to even try and care about others or her own mother. She has been this way since I've known her and I met her when she was 6 and she's now 22. In elementary school she learned to gain sympathy by pretending her mother was uncaring but she was smart enough not to say that she was abusive. She still behaves this way as an adult and shuts out those that further questions her. I'd consider her a true narcissist but a lot of other people on the internet claiming to be a true narcissist just seems to be extremely insecure or managing trauma."
narcissism,fc7gkip,t1_fc3yuhe,1577506789.0,so it sounds like you needed to protect yourself by blocking emotional responses become you were put down so much. do you agree?
narcissism,fc7g2aw,t1_fc64v9z,1577506352.0,"IMO it sounds like you were faking a personality to have ""any"" friends at all. My daughter does this and it's obvious. She's 16 and I'm constantly telling her to be herself and she'll attract her crowd because they'll have a lot in common. I also tell her the only way to find herself is to be willing to experiment with anything that attracts her in the moment that's not drugs and sex. Being open to exploring her desires and allowing them to change she'll develop her own sense of self and empathy for her community members that are as authentic as she is and those people will be her best friends. She's starting to see this and is genuinely caring about her friends now and maturing and making more logical decisions because she's less anxious about what others are thinking of her."
narcissism,fc7ff67,t1_fc3xmaq,1577505803.0,"i agree, but  if you consider yourself narcissistic, do you think your brain is just wired this way or were you raised to be exactly who you are? My daughter's father is a narcissist by definition. He will not take responsibility for anything negative and if you question him he responds defensively and he used to bate me into blowing up and then I became the crazy one and he was the victim. I no longer respond that way to his refusal to take responsibility so now he shuts down and uses ""i'm going through something"" to justify his poor behavior. He has 3 master's degrees and no job because he does not like to work with a team or have a boss. He speaks of himself in a grandiose way with nothing to back it up ... but his father is an extremely controlling and anxiety ridden narcissist and hoarder. His father does everything for him including pay his bills, car note and would even cut our grass when we were together and tried but failed to make my daughter think that i was going to hurt her in an attempt to control her. 

So, yes he's a narcissist but he was raised to be that way in my opinion and I was with him because my mother a narcissist turned my entire family against me so I was looking for anyone to love me so I ended up with him. I thought his behavior was normal because I grew up with it. I thought fighting daily was normal and lack of affection and or love was normal because I didn't get affection, wasn't listened to, was used as a tool to get attention and put down daily most of my childhood. 

So is he bad and I'm a victim? In my opinion, no, we're both products of our environment."

narcissism,fbivcda,t1_fbay0o1,1576916071.0,"I agree. I, American, think in my country we are quick to label and treat others based upon how we label them. My mom is a narc and used me to get attention from her 8 siblings. She lied about me being a drug addict, told her sisters and friends I wanted her boyfriend and made up various other stories about me for sympathy. My dad is most probably schizophrenic and brought a gun to my high school graduation and a brief case of precious gems because Jesus told him too and Jesus talks to him often. The lessons I learned from them were everyone else matters except for me. I have no feelings and no one cares how I feel and I will only have me to protect and support me so I better be strong. As a result, I was only comfortable in toxic relationships. So does that make me a victim to that emotionally abusive guy because I was taught these things? And is he horrible because his way is working?"

It takes a lot of patience but she's opening up and working through her fears and insecurities.

narcissisticparents,f7lfxog,t3_dwa1l8,1573839606.0,"I was the scapegoat for my cousin. My grandmother blamed me for everything she did. I moved in with them at 18 and even though I was at home, if she stayed out late or did anything it was 100% because i was here. My dad, her son, was crazy and absent because my Louisiana family put voodoo on him according to her. When i left and survived on my own I then became the golden child until i cut her off for chastising me for not having a relationship with my absent father who missed EVERY holiday and birthday and didn't even know my kid's name. 

I do resent her because my feelings are dismissed and the subject changes if i bring up anything about my grandmother. Both of her parents are passed so i get the need to support my grandmothers crazy but I do feel like im living on lonely island with no family. Our relationship is very surface and we see each other on Facebook. She then complains thet we're not close but I can't be around people that deny my human emotions. 

I was the scapegoat with my mother before i moved to VA from LA. I was the source of all her pain and stress. I was a drug addict (tested negative for drugs numerous times) a whore (before i started having sex) i wanted her boyfriend because I HATED him (ugh ... 1st time i met him he said you'd look prettier if you smiled and she agreed)  

My cousins (30 first cousins all living in the same town) could call me names and basically trash me, if i retaliated i was spanked. I was punished for saying i wanted to work in a grocery store and scan items all day when i was 10 (was supposed to say I'm going to howard university and be a lawyer). I was taught very early that everyone has feelings except for me.

I gotta get a boob job so these young boys realize I'm not an adolescent 😂😂😂😂 This show has me considering photoshopping pics to American men pretending I'm in brazil and asking for plane ticket money😂😂😂😂😂😂 it's definitely a career now

KinkyHair,exflzt3,t1_exfkdml,1566243474.0,"Yeah, but why is that courageous? Think about that, we are brave for wearing our short, kinky hair in a straight hair world. That should just be normal, but it's not and I hate that"
KinkyHair,exfk3m5,t1_exfj9ng,1566242305.0,"Yeah I've been told by non kinks that it's just a widely used term now but I was a bit offended. Was i logical? Maybe not, but when i went from middle back length perm to 2 inches of 3c/4a that was a huge life change. I didn't know how my bf would react, my job or my friends. I was called ""brave"" by coworkers and it took 6 months to learn what products to use, lol this past sunday. I'm still getting used to this new hair and it's very emotional."

BravoRealHousewives,ex2xtjg,t3_cr6hbn,1565977031.0,"I gotta disagree. The designer was hired to do a job and alexis hated it so she fixed it. Now, i still think it looked horrible and all of her current stuff looks like 2008 BEBE. Plus all of the shiny polyester and chiffon hurts to look at. I didn't hate alexis, but she and I could not be friends, my eyes would eventually roll out of my head."

BravoRealHousewives,ex2vuwc,t1_ewwuk0c,1565976136.0,"Am i the inly one that thinks Patricia was fueling her with thomas against Kathryn last year? I HATE ashley but why did Patricia walk away from this scandal like she was innocent? Also, kathryn is in love with her greasy/sweaty ass son, whitney. Why? No clue, but she really cares for him."
