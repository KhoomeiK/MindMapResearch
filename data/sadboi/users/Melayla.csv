The carnivores I've seen the most on YouTube seem to get what they need on just meat. I'm thinking about Dr Baker - he's an athlete that just eats meat, so I'm assuming his calcium needs are met just fine. I don't recall him talking much about bone broth, dairy, fish.

It doesn't feel good to be a bit neglected because of being competent, but it seems like this could be happening. You and your husband and children being placed behind the SILs because SILs are more needy."

I do think about my mom's future sometimes, and her husband is probably gonna die before her. Mostly though while I'll probably feel bad for her, I think I'm gonna feel guilty because my sister will be the one to take care of her. (My sister was/is the GC, and she's a dutiful sort of person. I live on the opposite coast and couldn't afford to go east even if I wanted to. That's my story and I'm sticking to it)"

Is it just dad and bro you're going to be outcast from? Cuz it sounds like you have a family of your own (""we can just visit""). It sounds like a Christmas with bro and SIL would be uncomfortable for anyone. For someone with your history with eDad and your late mother, it would be too traumatic to be worth it. 

Maybe you can just grey rock instead of lying? You really don't owe them an explanation - just tell them you can only visit for the day. If they ask why, tell them it's because you can only visit for the day. If you have to repeat that, you can move to your version of the ""asked and answered"" reply. Or even just don't reply at all. (depending on my mood, I either get snippy and tell them some version of cuz I said so, or I just go silent) Cuz they know why - they just want you to say it so they can argue about it."
raisedbyborderlines,fag0clx,t3_e8z952,1576036528.0,"I'm very much a loner, so I don't have to deal with family/friend interactions. 

But with more casual interaction (like at the grocery store - they're used to seeing me so some of them can be chatty), with those kinds of interactions I usually just turn it back on them. They'll ask about my holidays, I'll say good. But then I'll immediately ask about theirs. I supposed they're good with people, so they understand I don't wanna discuss it?

With the chiropractor, I'm guessing some of those questions were for the medical history and not just conversation? I'd be inclined to try and shut it down by saying I had a bad childhood and was restricted from a lot of things. If assistant was making conversation and isn't obtuse, that should shut it down. If she was taking a medical history, she probably needed to know about injuries (if the abuse was physical, does she need to know about any old injuries? Even if you don't wanna go into details about how you got them - you can always say you don't want to discuss details)"

Not sure I have any good advice. I don't know how large a rental market is - could you look for a short-term rental in a neighboring small town? Why do you need to wait until Feb/Mar to move to the small city with friends? Perhaps there's some way you can do that sooner?"

I've spoken to their customer service a few times over the years (not because of account problems, just questions about things) and they've always been wonderful to talk to. The service reps always seemed well-informed, and able to offer helpful suggestions when needed.

raisedbyborderlines,f9w6tq2,t3_e77dyb,1575687956.0,"I kinda think it depends on why you want to confront them. If you just want them to understand your feelings and viewpoint, and thus deepen your relationship with them - I think it's kind of pointless. It won't work and you'll end up frustrated and hurt. 

If you're going to go NC or LC, confrontation is again kinda pointless - since you already know a relationship is impossible and confrontation will just be seen as an invitation to them. It might seem like catharsis (and perhaps it does feel that way for some RBB) but I just don't think the BPDs will ever get it, and attempts at confrontation just seem frustrating. 

Does holding on to your boundaries feel like confrontation? (I'm sure it feels that way for the BPD). I tried to stand my ground when I was a child, but when I moved out on my own, I absolutely stood my ground. The final time before I went NC, I replied to an email telling her I found the topic racist and wouldn't respond to it. She replied defending her rightness in her statement. That's the last time I read or replied to any of her emails. Which I suppose is kind of a confrontation in that I stood up to her?"
raisedbyborderlines,f9o61gh,t3_e63kke,1575497240.0,"I've been having similar thoughts (thought I'm only a cat-mom). I have bipolar and sometimes I think things I'm not proud of but like you say, we're adaptable to change. I've learned about my bipolar so I can take responsibility for behaviors and change them. 

For example, my energetic demanding cat was yowling at me last month, yowling his lungs out for attention cuz he knows how much it annoys me. And I had the thought ""oh I hate you!"" But I was able to immediately realize no, I don't hate him, but I sure do hate those yowls. 

And then I imagined my 16-yr-old mother faced with me, a screaming baby... and I can see her making her hate face and probably yelling at me. And I don't think she would have been able to separate hating the baby from hating the behavior. (at 70-something she probably still couldn't separate those kinds of emotions tbh)

Maybe their self-centeredness makes it hard for them not to hold others responsible for their feelings."
raisedbyborderlines,f9f7z1o,t3_e4r1uo,1575262049.0,"Is it possible she's also BPD? A lot  of what you describe reminds me of my now-waif mother. My mother didn't try to have much to do with me until she decided I would be useful to her. 

Maybe what seemed like enabling when your dad was around, was just how she was getting her needs met. And now that she's leaving/left your dad, she has to find other ways to get those needs met - and she's targeting you as her new source. 

(Or maybe I don't know what I'm talking about because my dad and grandma weren't really enablers - so I don't have real experience with enablers. Just sharing what occurred to me as I read your post.)"
raisedbyborderlines,f9em9l9,t3_e4pkb5,1575246427.0,"Definitely sounds like she's throwing herself a pity party, and it's telling to me that she's losing friends and family support. There's only so much of the ""helpless lil ole me"" act that people are gonna tolerate. 

Seems to me that BPDs are highly likely to claim assaults that may or may not have happened. I know we're supposed to believe victims, but I just don't find that feasible when the ""victim"" is a BPD. 

It certainly seems possible someone could have a string of really bad luck. But if you have bad luck and talk about family and friends cutting ties and not believing you... coupled with a plea to support her because family is tired of doing it... that sounds so waify to me because it makes me think she has a history of chaos and expectations of leaning on people because of it."

I know when I moved out that I very consciously decided I'd never lie again because I felt like I had to tell a lot of untruths. Not to stay out of trouble so much as because she couldn't conceive of being wrong. So if the truth didn't fit her expectation, it wouldn't be accepted.

I wonder if people who are raised by normal parents really struggle to stay in touch. I don't know personally but from things I see when RBBs talk about their in-laws who aren't BPD - there seems to be mutually good and pleasant interactions with them. Almost as if, some children are shunning toxic parents while still having the desire and capacity to connect with people/parents who aren't toxic. 

BPD fantasies are just too exhausting, and ridiculous once you start freeing yourself"
raisedbyborderlines,f8224v1,t3_dym8ih,1574182362.0,"Are you having an aversion to people struggling with severe mental health in general? Or are you perhaps having an aversion (and rightfully protecting yourself) from enablers who expect you to handle someone they can't/won't help themselves? Like, it sounds like your dad is fine with being around SIL because he's an experienced enabler who is happy to ignore situation. 

It kinda sounds like your brother is suffering from a worse aversion than you - it seems crazy he ""doesn't believe"" in the very specialists that can help. 

But seriously - you aren't responsible for caring for her. That should be your brother. You aren't being weak, and this isn't a situation you need to deal with. 

You've given your brother as much support as he's willing to take - so that's job done for you. You're being a good sister and you're taking care of yourself. Nothing you've written makes you seem weak. Uncomfortable with taking care of yourself and having boundaries, perhaps- but weak? not at all."
