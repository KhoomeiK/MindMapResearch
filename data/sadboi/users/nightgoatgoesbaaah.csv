DnDGreentext,flr1qze,t1_flqa1vd,1585411145.0,">There are systems that handle this well, for example World of Darkness has the innovative tactic of encouraging non combat solutions by having an absolutely terrible combat system.

Lmfao, ain't that the truth. I'm currently running an OWoD Vampire campaign and before we even began the game I insisted on breaking down the combat system and half-way homebrewing it, so we have special rules for our combat. Despite this, the first time we actually had a combat encounter after the first session (which was mostly a tutorial) was on the twelfth session. Not my fault, the players kept avoiding the side-quests and finding unique ways to solve the main ones. I love them so much, but they can catch me so off-guard, haha."

Witch,f52l9si,t1_f52fddz,1571951288.0,"If you're Irish, then I'd definitely read Cunningham's books, because modern Wicca is based on a lot of old Irish/Celtic beliefs, though not fully. I'd also look up Druidry and Asatru, and see if either of those paths called to you, as well as researching old Celtic and Norse god/esses, to see if one of them calls to you. Even if you don't believe in them, researching who they represent can be inspirational for your own growth both as a witch and as a person. Try out Ogham or Futhark rune sets, to see if you can work with either of them easier than other divination methods. Also, depending on where you grew up, I'd also foster interest in the witchcraft of the area. For example, if you're near Louisiana, I'd recommend looking up Hoodoo. If you're near the Appalachian mountains, I'd research Appalachian folk magic."

If you're looking for something subtle, I recommend that they have a silver pentagram and like plants and tea and cooking. If you're looking for something less subtle and slightly more stereotypical (remember stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason, I know many witches just like this), they can wear a lot of silver jewelry, flowy clothes esp. shawls, have a crystal necklace that they use as a pendulum, and a pet cat that they call a ""familiar"" in private."

You can be an atheist witch (like myself), or you can be a Wiccan who doesn‚Äôt practice witchcraft.  If you‚Äôre interested in practicing more witchcraft, is there a certain style/spirituality (asatru, santaria, hoodoo, etc.) or tool (candles, crystals, tarot, wands, etc.) that calls to you? If not, I can recommend a few in general books, but if you give me more to work with I can recommend more. If you‚Äôre interested in Wicca, I highly recommend Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner by Scott Cunningham.

If you don‚Äôt have them yet, I recommend creating yourself tumblr, instagram, and deviantart accounts if you can‚Äôt afford your own website at the moment. More exposure=more money, and you can send people to these places so they can see what you can do.

insaneparents,f01262o,t3_d36crl,1568309533.0,"u/cyborgknuckles, please follow the advice of everyone here, especially: 

1.) talk to a school counselor, present counselor with all evidence of this abuse (because make no mistake, this is abuse). evidence includes these texts, any conversations like this you can record, and keep a dated list of when these events happen. if you have siblings, record their interactions with him as well.

if this doesn‚Äôt change your situation, then:

2.) greyrock method. look it up, memorize it, implement it

3.) start saving. even at 14 you can make money- cut neighbors lawns, deliver newspapers, help elderly in area with chores, babysit. i had my first under-the-table job at 11 years old, i made $8/hr and had thousands saved from just two summers of working. go to your local bank that‚Äôs within walking distance- open a teen checking account. put all your money in there so the scumbag can never get his hands on it.

4.) make a plan for the future. a lot of people have recommended trade school immediately after high school. i too recommend it- you‚Äôll be making good money a couple years after graduating high school and won‚Äôt be stuck trying to graduate a four-year uni and work a full-time job at the same time. it sucks, and i regret doing it. if trade school is not an option, go for an associate‚Äôs degree at a local community college. use the military as a LAST RESORT. a lot of kids from households like this enroll in high school to get away. do not do this. it is a big mistake. the only time you should enroll is when you feel it is your patriotic duty to do so (no diss to military peeps, i come from a military family). 

5.) if you have siblings help them start to greyrock and plan for their future. 

6.) if you have an aunt on either side (esp. mom‚Äôs side, grandparents work too) that seems chill, reach out to her. even if she can‚Äôt get you out she can probably help with deflecting attention from you, or letting pops know he‚Äôs being watched (my great-grandma edna stepped in for me, my step-father backed the fuck off for awhile after that), or even just give you money that you can put in savings.

7.) be safe. your life is your highest priority. this behavior by your father can escalate, and you want a plan for when it does happen. if you want any more advice, feel free to reach out and pm me. we‚Äôre here for you OP."

Ask_Politics,ezmfzr7,t3_d1gv97,1567991378.0,"As someone who supported Bernie in 2016, and who had many friends who volunteered around the country for him, there were 2 large issues among all the other stuff.

1.) Not just an outright lack of support from the DNC, but a yuuuge bias towards Hillary from them. And this wasn‚Äôt just from the DNC leaders- for instance, they would drown out Bernie supporters at events by placing speakers next to them playing loud music, so the only supporters that could be heard easily were Hillary ones. Lots of shit like that happened, just ask any person who actually went to the debates (what few of them there were). 

2.) Biased media- which is still a big fucking issue this campaign. For instance, in 2016 the media reported that 25k people attended one of his rallies. This was actually just the parks cut off number- tens of thousands more people were gathered outside of the official rally to support him. Also, debate talking points- much like this year (you may have seen Bernie‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs a Republican talking point!‚Äù moment from a couple month‚Äôs ago), a lot of questions both from the debates and from media interviews were full of sly BS like that. These same people who own the media also backed Hillary, so it was full of corruption and Bernie was handed a shit stick to start with. 

If you want to know more you can PM me and I‚Äôll forward you a friend‚Äôs FB info. He was at a lot of debates and rallies in 2016 and posted shit about it all the time. I can also go through my old FB feed for news articles I posted during the time. All of it really left a bad taste in my mouth about the DNC. Everyone nowadays is like ‚Äúthe Bernie or Bust thing was a Russian conspiracy‚Äù and maybe it started out like that, but I know people who left the Democratic party because of all the nonsense that went down. I still hate the DNC, but I‚Äôll vote for Bernie or Warren or Yang or our Orb Queen. We have some good peeps that stepped up this year."

ToolBand,exkn9vy,t1_exkn2bh,1566394336.0,"I understand your personal opinion, but when I first listened to Wings 1&2 on the CD all those years ago I thought they were one song, so to each his own. :)"
ToolBand,exkn17u,t1_exklobm,1566394163.0,I thought about it for a solid hour but liked Reflection more than Jimmy so it won out. Sadly only four spaces is not enough to hold all the awesomeness of Tool.

AmItheAsshole,eubda17,t3_cfkvss,1563645373.0,"YTA. I got here late so this comment probably won't see the light of day, but my parents divorced when I was a child, and now that I'm older my dad has gotten remarried and has started another family. OP, when you get older and wonder why your children never want to spend time with you, never reach out to contact you for any reason, never call you wishing you happy father's day or happy birthday, and always spend time with their mother (and not you) even on holidays, and have their mother walk the them down the aisle instead of you being there by her side- I hope you look back on this and understand how much you fucked up. You're an asshole, a big one. I hope your ex-wife finds a man that treats her and HER children right (since apparently you are ""without kids""). You don't deserve her, and you don't deserve them. I feel sorry for your girlfriend."

I absolutely hated sunscreens before I was recommended that one, isn't is phenomenal? Question though- I use the Hado Labo hydrating lotion as a moisturizer- is it a toner? If so I've been using it wrong this whole time, haha."

niceguys,etj1saq,t3_cbu6dz,1562864501.0,I hate this mf already. I can't stand it when people use mental disorders as an excuse to say or do stupid shit. I have Bipolar II and you don't fucking see me blaming the stupid shit I do on my illness. Throw this stupid son of a bitch away.
bipolar,etgfoth,t3_cb7ys8,1562789967.0,"I've managed to (mostly) stick to my diet for a complete month. It's a success because I've been saying that I've wanted to lose weight for about two years now and have never been able to stick to an exercise or workout regimen, but I finally try a simple CICO diet and BAM, 8 lbs down. It's been hard but satisfying, and my IBS is actually getting a lot better. :)"

AskReddit,etasjvg,t3_cakcx4,1562628068.0,"Are they in the service industry (e.g. waitress, retail associate, etc)? If so, they‚Äôre not flirting with you. They‚Äôre being nice because that‚Äôs their job. 

Outside of that- is the person making a lot of eye contact, and if it‚Äôs a woman does she glance down then back up into your eyes? Do they match your body position when you move (if you put your elbows on the table, do they do the same within the next few minutes)? Do their eyes dilate when they look at you? If it‚Äôs a woman, does she brush her hair behind her ear? Is their body posture open when speaking to you (no folded arms, no crossed legs, etc.)? Have they winked at you in at all? All of these are physical signs of attraction, and typically tell me if someone is flirting."
