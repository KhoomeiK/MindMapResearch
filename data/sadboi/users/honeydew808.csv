AskReddit,fm0m96v,t3_fruade,1585661415.0,"My great grandmother was a murderer.

Her name was 'Violet Agnes' but the locals called her 'Violent Agnes'. This was 1930s rural Ireland.

She moved in with my great grandfather after his former wife died. She promptly kicked out the his 7 kids, keeping the youngest daughter as a kind of house 'slave'.

She then gave birth to my grandad, Colin and his twin, Luke.

They were non-identical and apparently Luke was always much shorter and 'less robust' than my grandad.

One time in the middle of the night, Luke went to use the toilet, which was situated in a little hut a few yards from the house.

My great grandmother claimed she heard him calling out as he was 'trapped' in the hut.

She creeped outside with an axe and aggressively hacked at the rotting wooden door of the tiny hut.

Luke, who was inside, was decapitated and his body further mutilated by several blows of the axe - his death was surely a painful one.

Violent Agnes claimed it was an accident and that she was only trying the free the boy from the hut as he couldn't get out.

But it seems suspicious - why use an axe? And why the aggressive hacking? She was not charged. To this day my grandad doesn't like to talk about it..."
depression,fkx66l8,t3_fl010g,1584620024.0,"so sorry to hear this. I have been recovering from a bout of depression since last September and things were starting to look up a bit mid Feb. This pandemic has certainly triggered anxiety and I feel like its a step back for me now. But we're all in the same boat. If we take measures - social distancing, hand washing, self isolation - it will be over quicker. At this point I am more anxious about how life is going to change over the next few months and the whole uncertainty around that. Best wishes to you and just know that you're not alone."
Effexor,fk57g6c,t3_fgeso6,1583874940.0,"I have also been in this situation and took it later on in the day then at my normal time the following morning. It worked out fine for me so I personally would not worry about this. However, everyone is unique in how they react to this drug so it would be up to you. Nevertheless, be assured that nothing drastic will happen."
Effexor,fi6wnoy,t1_fi6pce0,1582209232.0,"Not at the moment. I have been on it for around 4 months now with no positive effect. To be honest it might even be having a negative effect since I feel so bad if I forget to take it, so its just a bit of an inconvenience now. So eventually I will have to wean off it, soon"
Effexor,fi6my5p,t1_fi5lzdg,1582201544.0,I do hope you feel better soon
Effexor,fi6mv36,t1_fi5m5mp,1582201460.0,Yes it’s amazing how short the half life is. One dose missed and the effects are so significant
Casefile,fi4owzt,t3_f623w6,1582145540.0,I listened to this today and feel the same. I identified with Becky as she is the same age as me. I can’t imagine what her family has been through.
Effexor,fi4a9iy,t1_fi44u63,1582137116.0,Yes I do wonder. Maybe we've stumbled across a new concept that should be described in neurology textbooks. The 'disconnected brain effect' haha
Effexor,fi3ufjb,t1_fi3tcqw,1582127880.0,Yes it’s surprisingly easy to forget. An app is a good idea.
Effexor,fi3o1xs,t1_fi3mi2y,1582123881.0,Well done for getting off it. It's more intense than I anticipated. I am certainly paying the price today
Effexor,fi3lpt5,t1_fi3jg1k,1582122296.0,"Yes I think that's an accurate description - the ""brain not moving with body"". It's like I take a step and my brain is in mid-air behind me, some kind of cartoon image!"
AriShaffir,fgr5jbs,t3_evudby,1581038675.0,Yep thankfully I do not “get it”
asd,fgr5cgt,t1_fgq2i1z,1581038541.0,Thanks! And you too. Best of luck
asd,ffp2zrd,t1_ffhxp0n,1580085208.0,Thank you. I’m looking into talking therapy. Just keep feeling like I’m not ‘ready’.
asd,ffgojmg,t1_ffgleer,1579911096.0,Thanks for your message and for sharing your experience. I hope you are feeling better. It’s good to know that others have felt this way. I definitely know what you mean by a ‘sucking hole’. Sometimes it feels like I have a panic attack set up and ready to set off inside me all day. And it’s completely irrational. I think my fear of failing academically is just making me so anxious and is now going to make me fail.
asd,ffgb2c8,t3_etbb8h,1579902317.0,"I was bullied in high school. This is weird but this person I was bullied by is in my dreams most nights. I don’t know if that’s an obsession but it certainly shows how difficult I find it to forget about certain people in my past. I don’t know if that resonates with you at all, but thought I would share this"
