relationships,fq1ths4,t3_ggdcw0,1589049081.0,"There was a time I was with a guy, and he’d been cheated on many times and had this hang up over it (getting to the point) he’d been sensitive to my having guy mates and once when I was out with a gay mate of mine (that he’d met) he got super upset and made this whole scene and we were all supposed to meet and my friend felt awkward - a week later he tells me he can’t get the idea of me fucking someone else out of his head 

We’d started the relationship monogamous, both agreeing that’s all we’d want but since that first day he confessed it, he was relentless. Every time we had sex: “picture me as someone else” “describe a different Dick” “call me a different name” 

He’d start asking me to look for dudes to fuck, the entire time I said to him that I was unsure if it was something he actually wanted and I told him that it wasn’t something I wanted at all 

Persistent, he kept insisting that I hook up with another guy.. go have sex with a guy but call him and put him on mute so he could hear it 

Kept trying to tell me I wanted it, if I hung out guy mates he would sexualise the relationships and make lewd suggestions 

It was exhausting, and I’d try to consider it for the sake of our sex life and relationship but.. man it just felt like I’d be going against my soul

Caused me a lot of anguish, do not allow him to force you against anything you want

What he’s doing is not ok, you have a right to a voice and to make decisions about what you’re comfortable with and what you want to do 

He doesn’t get to make them for you, I’m sorry about his behaviour"
