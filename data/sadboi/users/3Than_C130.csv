Conservative,flcjie0,t1_flcir4h,1585033318.0,"The fact is you’re adding a redundant label. Coronavirus has a label: Covid-19. Adding a distinction of where it come from literally doesn’t matter. The point with food is that there is no other descriptive factor about the style of food. And thus adding a label of where it came from allows us to envision what style of food that person is talking about. Coronavirus is a term that refers to the unique way it connects to cells and attacks the body. The spikes on the end of the virus 🦠 are unique to a Coronavirus. Coronaviruses usually attacks the respiratory system.

The point is coronavirus has 6 different strains that have arisen in multiple areas. The geographical region of China has spawned many diseases and so “China virus” is unnecessarily vague as hell. 

My point is there is an intent forming behind the “China virus” phrase. And it’s kinda convenient that it happens to be from the nation trump was in a trade war with. Also by the rules of English makes using the phrase almost nonsensical."

UBI could literally stop the starvation or homelessness that would be caused by people losing jobs. And further strengthen the economy by being indirect cash injections into the market to be a stop gap or help slow the downfall were in.  (The senate has a bill passing through now to basically be an emergency stimulus package for Americans)

Besides the market will continue to fall as long as investors see the virus as a threat so the shorter duration of the quarantine the better. Allowing the spread by keeping America running would just expose more people and keep the market spiraling downwards untill it runs out of people to infect.

I’m not against good healthcare that’s a good point but the thing is we’re already knee deep in this and I don’t see our healthcare system changing in the next week to allow those currently sick or dying to seek immediate help. Besides the best they can do rn is keep you hydrated and try and treat symptoms. The nature of viruses are hard to treat even if you know what treats them. We currently don’t have anything to treat the virus except plenty of water, sleep, a good diet, and staying clean. Cough drops might help.
