ADHD,fqmaosz,t3_gjjd4l,1589474327.0,"From my own experience, I super duper agree. I also think it‚Äôs the tendency to impulsively add more onto our thoughts that makes way for comma usage. Complex and compound sentences (sentence structure that requires commas in most cases) are just ways of adding more words/explanation into one thought, and I think having ADHD makes us regurgitate more into paper/text. In reality we can get our point across just fine without the added words, but it doesn‚Äôt FEEL RIGHT. üòÇ I also use parentheses and forward slash (‚Äú/‚Äú) a lot to squeeze in added explanation on top of an already over explained concept. I am a consultant, so I have to really work on my conciseness to get points across quickly. This results in spending 30 minutes writing a one sentence email. NOT EFFICIENT.

I always think of a funny term I learned in my presentation class in business school: Eschew Obfuscation. AKA avoid confusion. Don‚Äôt over complicate simple topics. A paragraph later, it‚Äôs obvious suck at this. The meds don‚Äôt help with this part of ADHD either because they allow me to focus more on the topic - which results in regurgitating more info. SOS.
