You can skip episode three and it makes no difference. It was also not final season material. However, we've had worse. This arc is no different from any of the other less action heavy arcs, for example heroes on both sides or the corruption on Mandalore arc. The fact that this arc was right before the finale is a result of the show getting cancelled. Had it not been cancelled this arc would've been in season seven and the finale in season eight. The arc is by no means bad and the hate it's getting is quite frankly unfair. Not every arc has to be an epic Umbara style battle. Not everything has to be action packed. I didn't mind the slower pace and I greatly enjoyed seeing the every day lives of the people of Coruscant"

HouseMD,fqywvzf,t3_gllz9o,1589755947.0,"There's a lot of unrealistic stuff that happens in that plot line. 

1. No way he would've gotten the warrant to search House's apartment. There was no legal justification to search his apartment for Vicodin because he had a prescription for it. At surface level, House walks around with a limp and a cane and he's taking pain pills so critical thinking would say that he could be taking the pain pills for the same reason he limps and walks with a cane. If by some miracle someone actually let Tritter look into his medical records, they would find that there is a chunk of muscle missing from House's leg and he is prescribed Vicodin to deal with the pain

2. He would not have been able to freeze Wilson's account like that and keep him from writing prescriptions. He couldn't prove that Wilson was lying. Maybe he is really messy handwriting and sometimes it's different. That's the case with me. Maybe he really did just feel like switching it up sometimes. Whatever reason there may be, Tritter cannot prove Wilson is lying and if Wilson really did prescribe all the Vicodin then he has no case. The whole point of the American legal system is innocent until proven guilty. Tritter assumed Wilson was guilty and punished him for impeding an investigation, which probably violates something in the bill of rights

3. He could've gotten sued and likely arrested for harassing House, Wilson, Chase, Foreman, and Cameron. House was a dick to him so he launches baseless investigation into something that no judge would let him investigate because there's nothing substantial to investigate and no cop would let him investigate because they don't wanna get sued. Foreman, Chase, Cameron, and Wilson refuse to help him crucify House so he freezes all of their assets except for Chase's and uses cruel and manipulative tactics to get them to squeal on House

You are correct. Tritter never would've been able to freeze Wilson's account and pretty much everything else he did to try to get House to go to prison. He would've gotten arrested or sued long before the case ever went to court"
