You kinda gotta suspend your disbelief a bit and accept that other heroes are just off doing their own shit. Captain Marvel isn't an exception. So she has her own space stuff she does that we aren't shown, but does help against Thanos.

I'm not saying the movie is a masterpiece of cinema. Just that there are concessions to be made in a comic book movie universe for things to make sense. And at the end of the day, Captain Marvel *isn't* dominating the entire MCU and constantly showing every other character up the way that Rey does in the DT.

I enjoyed Captain Marvel for what it was. Decent enough popcorn flick. Action was good and the 90's nostalgia was neat. My standards for individual Marvel hero movies are also a lot lower than for a Star Wars film though.

I remember tripping with a buddy one time and we were just chilling kinda in that quiet headspace for a minute. The Xbox was on and there was an ad for Gravity with Sandra Bullock on the screen. So I break the silence.

""Sandra Bullock's pretty hot.""

More silence. And then my friend just casually goes,

""Yeah. She looks good when she takes her clothes off.""

And I absolutely lost my shit. I can't even explain properly why it was so goddamn funny, but anyone who's tripped probably understands."
