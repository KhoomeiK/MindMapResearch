BPD,fp3mxur,t3_gazy08,1588282146.0,"I had a very similar situation last year. Mine was 2 months but to me it felt so much longer. I think having bpd sometimes it can feel like a week is a year with all the amount of high emotion and energy. He broke it off and i just shut down. I quit my job, I wouldn’t eat, I was overly drinking. I couldn’t stop crying. I think it didn’t help that he wasn’t a great person and told me I wasn’t attractive enough to date. (He kept us dating a secret.) 

It took me about 6 months to get over it but it’s completely put me off having a new emotional connection I with someone. I just can’t keep putting myself through that feeling, it’s so exhausting. 

I think as someone else said, our feelings are valid, it’s the reactions we need to change. I think it can take a bpd brain a little longer than most people but you will heal. It’s already great you can see the bigger picture. Please don’t be ashamed of your feelings!"
