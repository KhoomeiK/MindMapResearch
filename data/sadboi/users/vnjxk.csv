basically using attributes (which you cannot naturally have in lisp ) as a shortcut to preprocess the tag code, equivalent of \`\`(sorted (get-some-list ...))\`\`  but when you have a lot of attributes chained together it would be a lot easier to read and understand whats happening. 

(after trying to find examples and realising that for every one of them you can say ""yeah but...."" ) or maybe not Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯

also I wanted high level of referencing code:

\`\`\`html

<do-something append-results-to-next-child>...  
<next-child>...

I guess XSLT can do that too, but it clearly wasn't meant to. 

and it has a syntax that requires more understanding than basic tree concepts, randomly seeing the \`<multiply>\` code gives you a general understanding of what happens, while templating requires understanding the behaviour of  ""match"" and ""select"" and the general role of attributes in this context, which I think makes for a less robust use in the case of general-purpose language.

    <number>3</number>
