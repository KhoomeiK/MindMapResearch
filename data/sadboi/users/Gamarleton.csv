Competitiveoverwatch,ffad33g,t3_erj9e6,1579732701.0,"The idea is bs. You think it's gonna ban specific top meta heroes from being abused but it's gonna be used as a means of abusing people who spend a lot of time refining their skill on a more difficult to play hero just because it's a meme to hate on what is it widow, hanzo or genji mains or the like whether it makes sense in the current game or not.

I shouldn't have to be punished for playing the content I payed for.

It doesn't make sense that you should have to pay for a game that provides certain contents and then when you want to play something a bit more than the rest of the 30 heroes you get punished for it and banned out like it was some cancer phone game restricting you to play however you want. I go about my stressful day I come home to relax and just wind down playing whatever I want however I want and I want a real game with people at my skill level not some quick-play matchmaking dumbness, and banning heroes would only punish people who mastered a harder hero than people who used a strong meta hero in order to win anyway.

Role lock was good because we need tanks and healers in a team, but banning specific heroes helps nobody. If you master your few heroes you can overcome anything and match up well against even stronger heroes better and still do what your role requires of you.What is masters about anyway if we're not gonna be able to truly master anything? Are they just a bunch of baboons shoving a remote up their arse then?

As it is now you have to master 1-2 heroes per role. That's 3-6 heroes at least. It would be insane to think anyone would be able to, or have the time to master 6-12 of them.I love Overwatch and I don't want them to ruin that.This will destroy the game and if they're gonna do this I'm just gonna find a different game. If they're gonna do this I'm not gonna pay a single dime for Overwatch 2.

I ask them wtf they're talking about because on my side it's not there.       
Shortly thereafter they remove my entire post, depite the question only being one out of several points of my post and the rest being perfectly factual, and I have to ask them where exactly this sticky is because I don't see it. They just repeat what they said and eventually send me a link to it.       


I explain to him that I can't see it on the top of the subreddit, no response.

Now, don't confuse it with Surströmming (Fermented Fish) because it's absolutely horrid and whoever tells you it isn't is lying."
AskReddit,epnf9pw,t3_bva4r9,1559326516.0,"I think it has to do with the fact that transgenderism, if that type, is not just body dysmorphia caused by past trauma in your life.     

There are cases in which a person feels like they're trans, has just simply faced hard times in their life and the issue can be resolved better with therapy. But the ""real"" cases of transgenderism is due to chemical imbalance, and is to a great deal a physical problem.     

This leads to trans people feeling genuinely offended when people tell them they're just making a mistake by cutting up their bodies and should just learn to gain confidence and get mental help, because not only have they already went through a process of talking to many psychiatrists in order to get the right to transition, they literally are trapped in their bodies.     

Nobody chooses cutting themselves up like that before they consider other solutions. Especially since even todays medical science is not at all perfect and the transition will sometimes come with difficulties like having genitalia that looks odd and feels off, having genitalia they can't feel anything with and/or having chosen not to operate the genitalia itself to avoid the above... (Many of these issues lead to suicide even after transitioning.)"
