depression,fi46ft2,t3_exo6f1,1582134912.0,"Two weeks ago I drove to another city to meet someone I know. The whole thing did take two days and cost a lot of energy. A theater was selling their old costumes and I thought this could be 'fun' visiting it with someone else. I'm having severe problems doing anything meaningful with my free time, there's also a lot of stuff I simply can't do. The other person is my only social contact outside of family and I only see her a few times per year. For me 'this' is also ""practizing being an actual functionable person"", something I've been doing for years now. Trying to be an interesting person, improving social skills, etc. Neither her nor my family knows that I'm ill. I can spend the whole day with her without any problems but the next day I might not be able to open a door at university and go in. Being with her also gives me a break of a few hours where I'm not constantly screaming inside.

The theater was a nice distraction. There were hundreds of people who entered in groups. We spent hours looking through the clothes. Managed to somewhat deal with my impulsiveness, selfdoubts, feelings of being worthless and problems buying something. Bought a unique type of coat for 40 bucks in the end. We spent a few more hours in the city afterwards. 

Yesterday I hung up the coat in my room to get rid of the pleats and a bit of the smell. That was a mistake. Ofc mom discovered it, demanded to know what it was and saying it's trash. I already knew this would be the only possible reaction the moment I bought it. I got no privacy and neither does anything I own. Theoretically I'd have to put padlocks on every single drawer. Nothing I safe. Constantly hiding everything unless you want to be criticized and feel bad over every single thing. 

I already started not giving anything about the opinion of my parents a long time ago, I was way worse in the past where I automatically felt super guilty all the time and only acted in anticipatory obedience. All of this crap did and still does cost so much energy though. 

Guess it's my fault for not hiding it better though. There's no arguing with a wall. Doesn't matter what I say. Getting berated for over ten minutes over other stuff just because she found the coat. That piece of clothing was just another (very exhausting) attempt on doing something meaningful with my time, trying to find a reason not to kms. Or it's absolutely pointless and something to despair over, depending on my mood. 

Because of them criticizing everything I practically hide any interests and activities I am doing. Everything they see becomes worthless in my eyes. Therapist wanted me to talk to them for help but for me they've been incredibly toxic and damaging in my life and I've been trying to protect myself for years now. They're also the reason I needed (and still would need) therapy for years (they only meant well though! /s).

I can be ""too forgiving"", I can be fine making excuses all the time, I can be ""content"" with being a pos. If I'm content with not doing anything, with having no interests, no therapist is ever gonna say anything. They only say something if you have a certain ""pressure of suffering"", that's part of the whole thing. So if you're only lying to yourself, only doing avoidance behavior and not picking this up, shrug. Can't count on others for help though. 

If I say ""it's okay if you don't feel like leaving the house, I still like you"" every time I never would've left the house. If I say ""I like you just the way you are"" I wouldn't have tried to change anything. If I say ""you did a great job there, I'm proud of you"" I would've sat down and stopped doing anything cause task is done, no further work required. /s

Continuously hunting down negative thinking patterns and applying pressure. Social anxiety is just so much worse than depression, at least for me. 


>There's only you, you can't run away from yourself, so you have to love yourself more than anyone else could. 

Yeah, sadly. Trying to shape this into something that's acceptable though _but somehow it's still resisting any attempt._ Inb4 ""that's because you're doing it the wrong way, you'll never accept anything, nothing will be good enough, etc""

>Simply because no one can love you as much as you self have to. When I was depressed I, in my head, was hating myself. I thought to myself, how anyone could love me, if I don't love myself. And you know what... the more I started loving myself, the more I notice people around me love me too. Not as much as I need it, I'm still single, I'm not where I want to be. But they love me more than when I was depressed, plus the positive karma I got from being a happy person to hang out with. That's the positive amplification. 

I feel so huge amounts of disgust towards anything related to me.    

I don't demand from anyone to something as big as ""love me"" (unrealistic goals at this point), I'm just trying to be a more interesting, more enjoyable person so maybe someone could enjoy spending time with me.

Depression was pretty much the main reason I started going out more. Nothing else did that much, therapy didn't help either. If someone wanted me to help that would've been an opportunity but there wasn't anything. 

I can't express what kind of person I've been in the past. Not even being able to sit with others in one room. ""Loving yourself (so others love you)"" is 100% meaningless at this point. 


>That's the positive amplification. 

And I don't have that. Spending so much time and energy to fixing problems and there's no meaningful progress. At one point you're asking yourself ""for what?"". Then you need something to justify all this effort, all this stress. This itself costs more energy. 

Same for trying not to think about certain stuff or trying not to ""brood"". 

In my experience there are days that are so bad that you say ""it's just not worth it"". And where you're just sick of being lied to. I've been doing this shit for twenty years now and I had to listen to so much ""well-meant"" but ultimately really harmful stuff. And it's my fault for believing it. I just had no spine at all in the past and was so easy to influence. 

>I wish you all the best. But I think you might not find a solution to this if you don't visit a therapist. Work on it as long as you have the energy to do so, not when it got too hard because you stuck too long in the void. If you feel an urge to improve things, than it's all you need. Medication might make it easier, but every psychologist will tell you ""you need to want it yourself"" first.

Talked to therapists for years. Last therapist pretty much said nothing but meds would help anymore. Unable to take meds. And apparently nobody can talk about that with me either. 

>but every psychologist will tell you ""you need to want it yourself"" first.

Yeah, that's the main problem. Last big crash at my therapist and I told her ""I just don't have any will to get better anymore"". Okay, that's _my_ problem though. Therapist can't help with that. Therapy don't make sense that way. Come back if you've managed to regain some will. 

So I'm trying to work on that _alone_ aaand somehow there isn't really any progress. 

>PS: Also don't listen to anyone or yourself that something is too late (in a time sense). Only people who have given up say so. Don't listen to loser!

Yeah no, I'm watching others telling me ""it gets better"" every decade, I watch my therapist giving me the silent treatment, I watch others having stuff I objectively will never have and then I watch again others telling me that those things aren't that important anyways though at the same time this isn't supposed to change anything about me having any goals or about my selfworth. 

And then I have to invest energy not to have those thoughts and to be very, very thankful instead.

Part 2/2"
depression,fhel6ba,t1_fh98hbg,1581524719.0,"I don't have the energy to write a lot right now. 

>Self diagnosing something is not recommended. Sounds almost like as if you're a hypochondria. But in fact depression makes us feel socially awkward but you are not be that different than other people. Lets say, you wouldn't call someone with a broken leg, a bad runner. He's sick. You're sick. There's no way how you could even objectively answer if you're a bad runner. 

I obviously have a diagnosis for SA, otherwise I wouldn't be talking about it. I had no diagnosis and no awareness for it before I was 25 years old though. 

If anything depression pushed me to be _less_ socially awkward cause I was way worse before I got it and also worked a lot on it during depression. 

>And it wouldn't be that bad to have no friends. In fact suddenly having friends won't stop you from feeling lonely. You think if you had friends now, things would suddenly function, but you actually need to work on yourself or you'll lose the friends you made again in a week. 

Yes it would be bad. I lied to me about that for a long time already, ""who needs that anyways"". It's killing me on a biological level, I need face-to-face interactions with other people, not just chatting with others online. 

Having meaningful social contacts is _for me_ one of the best ways to distract me for a moment from endless brooding so in a way it does make me feel less lonely. The last sentence is obvious but I ""worked on myself"" non-stop for at least the last five years and wouldn't stop in that case either. 

I can't express how much energy I invested into making (and keeping alive) social contacts. I really can't. 

>Right, that's why having wrong friends is even worse than not having any friends. A lot of people have no friends because of that. Having wrong friends can make one feel worse than not having friends. I guess having friends isn't that good of a goal anyways...

>In my experience good friends need no out of the way effort. Visit them, talk to them, do things together. That's about it. Don't sacrifice things because of them unless they do the same for you. (but even than you have no contract to do the same if you don't feel like it)

Yeah, wrong friends are bad. That's why I tried to fix or in the worst case cut off people who aren't good for me. I'm very critical with myself and others (not always a good thing). 

I'm really not asking for much, I think. Someone who's also interested _in me_ and me not being the only one who is constantly investing into this relationship would already be a fair start. 

>Friends should improve your life, not make you feel worse because you have to sacrifice parts of your own life. You can create selfworth through believing that you're better than them. Just not being friends with shitty people makes you already a better human, no matter how much you need them. There's nothing wrong about being egoistic and believing in yourself and your worth. As long as you don't lie to yourself and are actually improving things and if you're really working on yourself. Then you do more than many other people do, they'll never improve. But one thing is very important, when you're depressed you feel negative emotions amplified. People who are actually not trying to harm you, might feel to you as traitor. That's why it's important to talk to professionals, they help you to clear your brain fog.

I am willing to invest parts of my time and my energy for others. I wouldn't call this ""sacrificing parts of my life"". As far as I see ""friendship"" is a give-and-take where both parts are treating each other fairly. I am willing to do stuff for others, it just shouldn't be completely one-sided. 

I don't think I'm better than others. I think that's a dangerous slippery slope that can lead to unhealthy thinking. Some people may not be good for me but I try not to think too much about if they're shitty people. 

>As long as you don't lie to yourself and are actually improving things and if you're really working on yourself. 

The problem is I really don't notice if I'm currently lying to myself. I'm looking at everything I'm doing, everything I'm thinking and I'm still sometimes doing really irrational things for years without picking it up. Reading about all kinds of wrong thinking patterns and still not noticing when I'm doing it again. 

""Improving things"" looks like such an simple term but it gets difficult once you're actually trying it. What's good behavior? Leaving the house is probably healthy instead of staying at home all the time. And then? Taking a walk, meeting people, exercising, learning stuff? Did all of those. Is this now actually good, do I feel better, is my life in a better state? Often that's not the case and things remain singular incidents without consequences (and I have a lot of problems with doing things that have consequences though I'm still trying). 

Is doing ""small steps"" good? In a way, yes. What if this is just avoidance behavior? What if you're just doing ""small, relatively harmless thing"" now because you can't deal with ""big, scary though actually meaningful thing""? Maybe you're doing ""small, relatively harmless thing"" for years without anything changing. And so on. 

>People who are actually not trying to harm you, might feel to you as traitor. 

Does it really matter. My parents never broke me on purpose, doesn't mean they aren't still (partly) responsible for tons of mental health problems. I just don't really care if people are purposedly trying to harm me, if they're a bad influence then they're a bad influence. 

In the end it's me who has to protect myself (and my mental healthy) from them, not them doing anything. 

>That's why it's important to talk to professionals, they help you to clear your brain fog.

Yeah, did this for years and made a lot of bad experiences. One of my biggest crashes happened directly in therapy and nothing/nobody was able to fix me since then. There was also a time where I tried a new therapist and had such a bad experience I started selfharming again afterwards. I just don't see therapists as 100% positive anymore, they make mistakes as well. So I'm relatively wary (in the end it's me who has a crash and who has to deal with it, they just say stuff). Besides me having really big problems trusting anyone by now.

>Being nice to yourself, means working on things you hate. Not because you feel good while doing so, but because deep down you know they help you to get rid of anxiety and make you stronger. Pretty much any improvement I made over the last few years, was tackling things I hated to do. 

I mean being nice in a way of ""today I wasn't able to leave the house because I was too exhausted. That's okay, I forgive you"". Instead of ""leaving the house anyways and no matter what"". 

Besides it fucking sucks that I have to beat myself for years trying to have interests, all of this feels so fucking ridiculous. That's the stuff other people do ""for fun"", not ""I have to force myself to follow [interest]"". 

>Maybe connecting negative things with a positive reward is worth a try. You hate going outside? Go outside anyways, but buy an ice. You hate cleaning your house? Clean it anyways, but watch a show meanwhile or listen to music. You hate being alone with your thoughts? Why not visit a park and be alone there but enjoy the nature. You hate being bored? Write it down while thinking about things you like/enjoy and make a plan to fulfill them.

Often feeling to worthless to buy or eat things. Combined going outside with doing photography instead. 

Trying to find a ""healthy"" mix of tasks and rewards. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. 

>Why not visit a park and be alone there but enjoy the nature.

Tried stuff like this dozens of times, often it makes me feel worse. Tried to come up with alternatives but I feel empty all the time. It's just the worst, ""just think of something"" and feeling nothing inside, not having any ideas. 

>Depression sucks out energy, so much energy. If you have a plan you can try to stick to it and with small goals you create a positive feedback loop.

I've been going out for years and no matter what I do or what I'm thinking during it I'm still exhausted for days afterwards. Apparently it never changes that I have to beat myself to actually do stuff. This doesn't reallly improve my selfworth. /s

>Before you can improve, you need to know what you really want and the details how it's possible to achieve them. Write the details down. Only look back at it after a week. Is it realistic what you wrote down? Have you missed something? Did you already went further and accomplished the first step of your plan? No? Don't worry, improve the plan even more. 

I have no idea what I want. That's the emptiness thing again. Thought about it for years, talked to other people. Nothing. 

And I can't make any plans. Constantly running into insane directions and not picking it up. ""It doesn't matter, at least you're doing something"" hasn't helped me in life.

As far as I can see the phone company acknowledged my order... but there is no bill. They have my bank data though so I thought they already debit the necessary sum?

Next logical step probably would be checking my bank account but I can't access it cause I'm blocked for...months now.

Didn't really want to go in the first place because of bad social anxiety (sometimes driving for almost an hour and then not being able to open a door) but parents expected me to go.

Gps sent me the wrong way so I wasn't in front of the club but a few hundred meters away from it. Sat in the car for 15 minutes again (like I did so fucking often before I ""had"" to go social events cause locked cars are just nice safe spaces) before I left and walked an icy path through a forests with no lights while having no idea if this was even the right way. All while cursing my damn brain again. Even anxiety or depression or whatever isn't as bad as being so fucking stupid and doing incredibly irrational shit over and over again, often without noticing.

Guy outside the club. Managed to make some smalltalk. Left afterwards but couldn't  open the door of the club. While freezing I pulled out my phone (which has no reception) and pretended to write stuff while I waited if someone else was coming. When a couple came I could enter as well. 

Tldr ""science arena"": it was teachers from each field talking about it. Some stuff was kinda interesting and entertaining, others boring. If anything it told me how much charisma some people are having and that you should pick your major according to which professor is funny and can keep you awake. None of the fields were something I wanted to study though.

But _at least_ I managed to stay in one room with people. I am probably supposed to call this ""a success"" but stuff like that is killing me. I am so alone and so dysfunctional; other people go out to find a partner, I am ""happy"" if I can manage to stay in one room with young people (not even talking with them) without screaming inside.

I guess this is similar to being poor and trying to get by with the little money you have. Trying to save something to get out of this situation but it's never enough. Being poor is fucking expensive and being mentally at the bottom is totally exhausting."
depression,ff4p9ap,t3_cml6ni,1579569148.0,Can't stop playing the waiting dog song from futurama in my head while I'm wasting my life.
depression,felmgpy,t3_cml6ni,1579225695.0,"A few days ago there was a package for me in the mail. I don't know anyone so I already suspected it was from my former therapist and I was right. I sent her a christmas card I made three weeks ago (just the card, without text) because I got so much time on my hands, I am so bored, I have no social contacts and idk. I'm still angry on her but none of this is making any sense to begin with. 

Anyways she sent me a small bottle with a liquid and a text that she was happy about the card and that she sent me the bottle if I might want to try out something. I guess it's called ""aromatherapy"" and afaik it could _theoretically_ work... at least it's not complete bogus like other alternative medicine. Fyi she is a fully licensed psychologist but also does some alternative treatment now and then but usually doesn't bother me with that. 

Haven't tried it yet. Not sure why, no energy, selfhatred, not doing positive things on purpose, not expecting anything, take your pick. If anything I'm more to blame for this whole situation cause I'm too stupid to go to a doctor and take real medicine. 

Pls no responses that just rant on my therapist cause that's just reflecting on me."
2meirl4meirl,feg5pvk,t3_eoxvan,1579078160.0,"And I'm afraid of my family, school or being in public. I basically only move between home and school. I don't do _anything_ on my own, my only goals in life are ""avoid anything that hurts"" and ""do what's expected of you"" (which is an eternal conflict). My greatest fear is anyone noticing that I'm ""not working"" or not being functional. Me being addicted to video games is probably still one of the healthiest parts of that life. 

Yeah, great times. /s"
depression,fecxz92,t3_eofgoa,1578989201.0,Nope. I'd settle for someone who just likes my presence though. I've been chasing after other people for years and still have no spcial contacts.
2meirl4meirl,fec14xf,t3_eo5ojb,1578965117.0,"""Apparently my irrational fears aren't _that_ irrational after all"" is just the worst. It makes selfdoubts ten times as bad."

_spends years and tons of energy trying to improve something_

""Well you shouldn't always try to do everything alone and on your own, accept other people's help.""

???

There's just _isn't_ any help, I'm so sick of waiting, sick of endlessly talking in front of people who are just silent and like ""yeah that's _your_ problem, dude"". 

All of this is such a dumb loop."
depression,fdkiyvp,t3_elqwy9,1578504734.0,"Social anxiety since I was ten, no friends my entire life, barely left the home between age 10 and 25. Not realizing I was ill until that point, starting therapy which didn't help and made some things worse. Multiple times in life thinking I wasted my life despite everything I did. Stuck in so many loops that may last years. 

Feeling empty all my life. No interests, no passion. Studied a crap major, like my (extremely controlling) parents told me to. My ""career"" basically doesn't exist. I'm years behind in development, both in internal maturity as well as ""where one is supposed to be in life"". Still can't do a lot of things average 18 year olds are able to do.

Spent so much time and energy trying not to have such a pos personality. Apparently didn't work cause still not a single friend. Doing really insane things, sometimes for years, while either not noticing or not being able to do anything about it. 

Tl, dr: wrong gender, weird sexuality, catastrophic social and professional life, abusive family, awful personality, wasted life. ""Not existing"" is my number one goal, if I had a button I would've pushed it by now. Still to much anxiety and too little energy to make an attempt."
depression,fdkhqtr,t3_eloddk,1578504115.0,"Both therapist and social anxiety: ""yeah but that party wasn't _that_ good to begin with, right? You didn't really want that anyways, you don't even really like parties, you're not the right kind of person for them. Which is totally okay btw, some people just prefer staying _alone_ and doing things on their own instead. As long as one is content doing this (or at least persuades them that it is) everything's fine!""

It just kills me when therapists tell me the same stuff my lying body has told me for years as well."
depression,fdkhb03,t3_cml6ni,1578503869.0,"Therapist: ""why don't you let your family help you? They'd like to, you know?""

Mfw my family has been so controlling I could've as well grown up in a cult that forbids any contact with outsiders. Me trying to get away from this for years, if I could I'd teleport to New Zealand and break all contact with my family"
depression,fd9gk1e,t1_fd6bgmc,1578233015.0,Thanks. Imo sometimes it's good to find precise analogies to describe complex conditions that would otherwise need a lot of explanations.
