summonerschool,f4zjczb,t1_f4z3qba,1571908647.0,"people talk about the games played and hours put in but really forget that you have to really USE your time productively. That means when you make a mistake, you should be figuring out why it happened and how to prevent it from happening. The same thing goes for when you kill an enemy,  you have to fully understand why they died so you can re-apply the same knowledge in a different scenario. It's all about learning. You can play a champion for hours and hours, but still not improve at that champion. There are many players that have extremely high mastery points but still struggle to play their champion effectively. Remember to learn, watching professional one-trick players can definitely give you a lot more insight on the champion and cut down the time on learning them. Best of luck, I hope this helped!"
