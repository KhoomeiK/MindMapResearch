I don’t care what side their on, nearly everybody in the U.S is suffering. As a teen who can’t do anything but watch as his “golden years are being taken from him” I’m mad as hell. My parents want me to learn digital programs to get a job online. My fucking neighbors are loud as hell and I want to do something about it. And I don’t know when this covid shit will end. I want to be out skating. And I am but not with my friends. I feel like society and our country as a whole is getting dumber and dumber by the day. I see girls on their phone not willing to get out of the way when I tell them to. Ignoring social distancing as a whole and going outside to see their friends.

Like yeah I haven’t seen my friend in a while but I can deal with it. Fuck em all. I try not to think Ill minded but I hope everybody who ignores social distancing and protocols and whatever the CDC says gets held accountable, if that includes me than so be it"

15-20 for Deluxe Class

25-30 for Voyager Class

And 35-50 for Leader Class

Plus 70-90 for the new Commander Class

But I’m line with masterpiece figures. Like G1 accuracy and joints that don’t become loose over time, which I’ve noticed hasbro’s figures joints become really loose. Especially if your buying used figures."

I would try listening to motivational music whenever you feel like doing it. Eminem or rap, or maybe something to that extent. Getting out and going somewhere helps to. Walks help a lot. Finding hobbies and getting out of the house or wherever you do it, is a start."
