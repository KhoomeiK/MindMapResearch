NoStupidQuestions,foisr9m,t3_g7oni3,1587795812.0,"Hi! In my country, people usually don‚Äôt go to therapists because its a taboo or some people look down on it. Also, most people think its not necessary and are not aware of the repercussions of mental health problems (and also they say its just for crazy people). And it is a common that depression and a lot of mental health related issues are for ‚Äúthe weak‚Äù (at least my family does). 

In my personal experience, I‚Äôve dealt with depression for years, but didn‚Äôt realized I‚Äôve had it because i just felt it was me being pity or just being dramatic. Fortunately, I decided I needed help and reached out to a psychologist. This has really changed my life. I believe awareness of mental health issues help a lot of people like me starting a journey for a better quality of life. 

In america, there has been a recent wave of mental health awareness, it might be cause of an increase on suicide rates, domestic violence, drug abuse, or shootings. Also, an unhealthy life style can lead to a higher rate of depression, anxiety and in general poor mental health.

What im trying to say is that you are valid. The way society looks at you is out of your control. Your identity is never erased, and i bet you have wonderful ways to portray it with your personality. 

What I can see in you is someone that has a background, that even though is lucky to have this society privilege, also feels the struggle of some minorities (at least at some degree). This is something that makes you, you. 

You are not less for having these privilege. It doesn‚Äôt make you less part of a community. (If someone says so, then fuck them) You are valid to every community that part of you feel identified and that should be the spirit of being part of a community. 

I can see that you are struggling with these feelings and not feeling happy about this, and its ok! Don‚Äôt beat yourself up for not being happy. Explore your uneasiness, your emotions and feelings towards this, why you may feel that way/react/think...

You are valid and you are not alone."

If it was enough for you to consider being with him (after not being attracted to any men at all)  and considering your past, I think he must be very special. Aside from this situation that happened 2yrs ago, those unpacked compartmentalized growing up feelings would have come to surface eventually, even if you packed them again, this is something that you must face. Hence, going to a specialist if you need help.  I'm not a psychologist, but do you feel that your desire to be with a woman right now is a coping mechanism to avoid unpacking these feelings again?"
bisexualadults,fm7nnim,t3_ftlmys,1585832503.0,"Hi! Well first of all, how do you feel about men in general, do you really think that your attraction towards them is directly affected by being sexually abused growing up? Do you feel that you need help? If so, consider going to a psychologist and that can help you figure out a lot of things. Did you use to initiate sex?  If so, in what way you might think that having this experience with a woman changed that, is it because you feel more secure during sex with a woman? Sexuality is fluid, and we change. I believe that you should talk openly to your best friend about it, especially if you imagine building a life with him. I'm in a 5yr relationship with a guy, great guy, and plan on marrying him, but since I started to accept my sexuality, my desire to be sexually attracted to him has shifted a bit. I can relate to that, and communication can make a huge change. What you are feeling right now is completely valid and due to your past, it's understandable. Don't push yourself, it might take a while for you to sort out your feelings and sexuality. This is something you must discover"
