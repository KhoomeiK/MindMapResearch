BravoRealHousewives,fnc2hkc,t3_g0vn7g,1586827235.0,It’s so hard to watch Jaqueline and her daughter talk. They’re both emotionally immature. How quickly Ashley broke down in tears when she’s confronted by her tardiness and being told to stick to a schedule is jarring.
BravoRealHousewives,fnc2by0,t1_fnc1rox,1586827141.0,Yeah I slowly warmed up to Melissa bc I had a weird loyalty toward Tre. I could see Melissa and her sisters being snotty toward Tre. But I think Melissa has overall a good heart.
BravoRealHousewives,fnc24e1,t1_fnc1p49,1586827016.0,Omg yessss I just saw that part with the screaming guy. Tre was more feisty back then. The way she pointed her finger at Kath when she said “unattended” phew I thought she was gonna poke her eye ball out lol.
BravoRealHousewives,fnc1ytg,t1_fnc0qcc,1586826924.0,Same! Melissa was very off putting in season 3. Id say she’s mellowed out or at least more self aware of herself now.

Libraries,fkpy09i,t1_fkpwo75,1584422986.0,"EXACTLY!!! This is what people don’t get. We keep telling people that libraries are important, don’t close us down, #FundLibriaries, and in the same breathe how can we then say “we’re non-essential!” I get it this is a scary time for everyone, if you don’t feel well stay home, call out sick. Just don’t give everyone, especially those who keep want to close us down entirely the image that we are “non-essential.”"
Libraries,fkpugy8,t1_fkpmjea,1584419747.0,"I totally agree! A high percentage of my patrons don’t have access to the internet, tv, newspapers, smart phones, or even a home in some cases. Libraries are here to provide information for all. These people don’t have access to information easily need libraries. In my library we have closed down every other internet terminal to allow people access but put some distance. We are rather small and able to wipe down counters, surfaces, and internet terminals all the time. We also handle all materials with gloves. I think most people won’t come to the library because they want to stay safely at home, but I want to be open for those who don’t have a home and need to know what’s going on. To those who say that the homeless should just go to a shelter, many of the homeless in my area don’t want to because they don’t like rules and they can’t do drugs in shelters. It’s rough every where. I get others feel strongly that libraries should close, for me if my staff want to call out sick that’s fine with me."
BravoRealHousewives,fk39xrg,t1_fk30jo0,1583823457.0,It’s funny bc they both do it to each other. Bethany has said that she didn’t like that Kelly acts as if they never met even though they’ve met many times before. So as result she’ll say something sarcastic or snide back to Kelly.

FrugalFemaleFashion,famwk3x,t1_famr89j,1576215027.0,"oh boo hoo i just want what i paid for:(  the horror of giving a company money and to expect them to give me what i ordered for:( how pretentious am i?!!! no one else does this right?! how crazy am i, to expect service that i paid for with money?!  it doesn't matter where the company is located, i still expect all of the items i paid for. the packaging was shit but the 2 items that came were alright. but i still paid for the last missing item. what's the alternative to this?! be cheery that i just got 2 of 3 items i paid for?! is this normal to pay for items and then be okay that just part of what you paid for arrived?"
Libraries,famvp6q,t1_famvg2u,1576214261.0,"sure, i am human and can empathize with someone who is having a hard time and have waived their fines. a lady who had borrowed a bunch of kids books thought she renewed them online but it didn't go through and she had them out for a month and had racked up over $100 fine. because i understand that our website during the month that she thought she renewed the books, were having issues i waived the fine. i also explained that she can check her account on our app since everyone has a smart phone now. this mother frequents the library and her kids love to read, it was no trouble for me to waive her fine. i think if everyone broke down the barrier to talk to people/librarians they'll see that we're understanding people."
Libraries,famv9yu,t1_famuun7,1576213893.0,"it's not about me. i'm at the library 5 days a week and i explain to all patrons that even i get fines. i also go over with them how they can avoid them. not everything is about me and i'm sorry you got that idea. i think this idea that a person can find their way to a library one day and forget how to get back to return their items the next day is crazy. even if my system goes fine free, i would still want our materials returned. books are for use. if a patron doesn't return the books are they really being used? i'm not being sarcastic. i'm not trying to offend or be provocative. i'm commenting on a post topic that's been around for a long time and this is my opinion. you may not agree with me and that's fine same as i don't agree that we should be fine free. i hope that YOU have a good day."
Libraries,famuvnx,t1_famu2nd,1576213549.0,"that's cool! my system have thought about going this route. i don't mind going fine free for kids. parents tend to make their kids get cards bc they're cards have high fines. if the kids accounts are limited to juvie material i don't mind. i don't like the idea of being the book police. i don't think all patrons are terrible, the ones who don't return books are such a small percentage of our patronage and like op stated sometimes these patrons don't return."

Libraries,famtt8t,t1_famt3wt,1576212670.0,"i know thats why when i check materials out to patrons i let them know that although there is no limit to the amount of books you can borrow but to be aware that if you check out 10 books out and they are all a day late it's a 25 cent charge for each book. then i also let them know of ways to avoid the fine, like renew the materials a few days before they're due. they can check their account online and see what items are due and when. they can also renew online or call the library. we also have a library app that will send alerts to patrons that they have items due soon and encourages them to renew the items if they're not ready to return them."

Her scenes make me feel like I’m watching DBTFP bc she doesn’t film as much with anyone else besides her family. Also, it’s interesting to go back and see how people were and think about current seasons. For instance, I saw the scene where Cynthia is talking with Leon about Noelles schooling and how she was homeschooled bc she wasn’t happy at school. It made me think about the recent season where she had a panic attack when Cynthia threw her a going away party for college. I wonder what their dynamic behind the camera is like. These two scenes makes me think that they’re probably really close/clingy. Also seeing when Kenya comes into the scene is fascinating and now knowing that Apollo did text her like she said makes me mad that people didn’t believe her. Omg I almost forgot that Porsha was married!! I remembered her husband announced his divorce on the radio. That was dirty!! Anyways this is a good season"
