The things I've had to consider are - parts of the garden very rarely get sun, at all. The bit immediately next to the house we have as a paved patio, it is full shade probably 99% of the time.

Things tend to grow later on in my garden than in a south facing garden - bulbs flower later in the spring, blossom appears later, frost pockets last longer. On the positive side, the grass stays greener in dry weather.

Because of lack of sun, you may find you get waterlogging issues in wet weather if the drainage isn't great (we have clay soil) and you'll have to consider that when planting.

But there are plenty of ways around it. Raised beds, hanging baskets, small greenhouses, all help things to either get more sun or warm up.

My main issue to be honest is not the garden but the living room, since it faces north it never gets any sun and is always dark. You can't sit in the sun looking out over your garden."

CasualUK,fotytyx,t1_fott5cp,1588070971.0,"I actually think, if you can afford it, it's good to buy the more expensive foods at the moment - if there are shortages, that means you're leaving the cheaper foods for those who can't afford to spend the extra. At the beginning of this when things first started going out of stock it was just the really dear foods left and if you're on a tight budget, that would have meant you couldn't buy anything."

I do sometimes miss being ""skinny"" but I feel a lot better and I can see in my face the difference between [then](https://imgur.com/a/ENlBYR3) and [now](https://imgur.com/a/zwIFM6X) (same shirt bonus!).

For me, I was dealing with gastro issues that made eating hard. Which in turn made fitness hard, because its very hard to exercise if you aren't fueling yourself. So the first step is figure out what's stopping you eating more - if it's a stomach issue, sort that out. For me a nausea med changed my world.

Other than that, understand calorie dense foods. It's difficult, because these are the foods most people try to avoid. Ignore all the things that say ""fats are bad for you"" etc, they are not, and when you are tall you need a lot more calories than the average 5'3"" woman who is trying to lose weight. Embrace things like nut butters, avocadoes, salad dressings, oils etc. Use real oil instead of oil spray. Put butter on your toast.

And don't feel you have to eat ""clean"" whatever that means. To be honest I feel much better if I have snacks of chocolate and stuff, it just makes me happier.



On a funny note, my younger brother is 6'6"" and really skinny. My mum told me she is impressed with his skills, he is making lots of smoothies these days. What goes in the smoothies, I ask? Well... Oreos, ice cream, milk. That's his smoothie."

Where as in real life, you say something, only the people who can hear you can make comments. So you're less likely to encounter someone arsey."

I tend to get down voted on the social anxiety sub if I talk about it because ""who are you calling selfish""."
