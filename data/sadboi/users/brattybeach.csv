Face masks and hair masks some people do weekly, but I would say every month. I love the Aussie 3-minute miracle for my hair. 

Walking is an easy and chill form of exercise. I for one hate when people look at me, so I like to wear headphones, sunglasses, and do a mental activity so I don‚Äôt think about it. For example, you could do a DIY walking scavenger hunt (look for a small rodent, find types of clouds, what are your senses picking up). It‚Äôs a great mental activity!"
