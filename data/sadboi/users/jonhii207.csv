It's fun that you can ""go ham"" and have more fun vs AI than in pvp. I do find that the herassement in Hots is a lot better than in another well known Moba that I stopped playing because of how toxic people were. But yes the sad reality is that many players forget to have fun nowadays"

Have to admit I've tried being that guy that jumps forward, but already realized that often times I realise I jumped in while my team can't follow. and then my role as tank is useless because I've taken too much damage without it actually helping my team. So learned not to do that."

leagueoflegends,fnwgzw1,t1_fnwgvat,1587318202.0,seems like Rekkles also didn't get a single chance to really do much. feels like bad preparation from the side of FNC. don't know
leagueoflegends,fnwgv65,t1_fnwgplt,1587318130.0,"no but seeing how they took down others team with ease. and then this, this was straight up a really bad series from their side. almost like they barely prepared for what G2 could pull out of their hat"

leagueoflegends,fnvybj0,t3_g48ctj,1587307569.0,Fnatic has never beaten G2 without caps. Looks back at 2019 where they beat G2 multiple times during the split and pushed them to 5 games twice in the finals...

leagueoflegends,fn7kaxb,t1_fn7jfma,1586722030.0,Everytime they interviewed YB for a hype vid he always seemed like he was about to blow. The guy did great for FNC in 2018 but 2019 was a shitfest of saltiness from him.
leagueoflegends,fn7jv2x,t1_fn7g6t9,1586721777.0,Serieusly???? G2 is balls deep inside Vedi all year long. Did you not listen all series long or what? Let stand how he tried to defend the fuck up fest that G2 brought last week. Only Sjokz tried to caml the bias down during the desk and fuck did she get shot down by Ender who got so triggered it was fucking amazing. You could see his vains about to pop when Sjokz asked maybe just maybe G2 were actually playing bad this time. Ender litterally cut her off and started shitting a bunch of shit about limit testing and how G2 is just testing their limits by letting OG almost take the win and G2 this and that. Let's hope this shit calms down next week when they play MAD
leagueoflegends,fn7cbp0,t1_fn7bvna,1586717523.0,With these kind of games against one of the lowest team in EU? Let's wait and see

leagueoflegends,fn6snwi,t1_fn6si6v,1586706560.0,yea no put because he got a penta claiming he is on the same level as someone like Rekkles when they won because of perkz on LB. come on Vedius is a huge G2 fan we get it but I thought they could not be this biased
