I'm just worried and really hoping that it's the Lamictal, because I'm travelling in less than 3 weeks and the country I'm going to has shit physical health care, not even thinking about mental health care. If it doesn't stop here, I'm literally walking into a lion's den.

I will ask my doc about this. I see him tonight, so hopefully we can get somewhere with it."
BipolarReddit,fjd0aeg,t1_fjcvh7j,1583242368.0,"Oh, I never really thought of it like that. I guess I can overwrite sometimes, but I thought that was just a part of me, hehe. It's also weird cuz I don't notice any racing thoughts in the daytime, I feel pretty 'normal' (that's a bad way to put it, but ya get what I mean). Like, I'm not having the animation reel during the day time, at all. When I asked someone on here about it, they said it sounds more like dissociation, but I guess the same thing/action can mean different things for different people.

Really? Do you get sleepy during the day, at all? If you don't mind me asking, did you have any weird side effects sleep wise in the beginning or with increases in titrations (or what they were), and how long did they last? You don't have to answer. I'm just trying to figure out where the Lamictal stops and where the worry of something else takes over.

It might be doing this weird thing for me where it's activating and sedating at the same time. Or, maybe, the lil bit of sedation is the Lamictal, and the rest is another 'phase change'. 6.5 hrs ain't enough sleep, you're right. I so desperately want to do better, but no matter how I try, I just cannot sleep more than a couple or few hours a night as of late. And, like you said, that lessened sleep is probably contributing to my animation reel situation, cuz I don't get that when I get enough sleep; it's usually when I'm far into not sleeping (amongst other things)."
bipolar2,fjczax5,t1_fjcvrqs,1583241572.0,"Hmmm....that may be the case. I was getting worried because I always get really vivid dreams for about a week before I start a hypo/manic episode, and at that point it hits me like a truck. The Lamictal dreams before were vivid, but they weren't *this* vivid....they were '2-D' and these are '3-D' and I always get '3-D' when manic, if that makes sense. And, it's been a few weeks since I upped my Lamictal, and these are just starting now, whereas I got weird dreams pretty quickly after starting the 50 mg. But, even, maybe it's just taken a while for my body to absorb really, and the 100 mg just has much stronger effects, even if delayed. 

Thank you for going into the science of it all! It helps to know what's actually being done to my brain as I'm taking meds for it. I'll definitely grab extra proteins, fats, and vitamins and minerals, as my diet has been piss poor for a while and I know that's not helping."
BipolarReddit,fjcyz3j,t1_fjcvl61,1583241297.0,"Exactly! There's always a lapse for me too, into much worse. Only once this didn't happen, and it was a very brief hypomanic episode, while well medicated and really taking care of my health and keeping close contact w/my doctor on a weekly basis. Only once. 

I'm starting to realize even sooner too. Haha, trying to get out of hypo is hard! It kickstarted my starting 2 months of overdue school work, and if I didn't have that hypo ep, I never would've started it or had such drive. Of course, it quickly devolved into a nasty mixed episode (how I finished all that work in a couple of weeks, on top of that, the world may never know) and, of course in this state, I decided to delay starting some much needed meds. My doctor is very kind, and would never outwardly chastise me (only rarely), but I could tell he was furious. It's not a good road.

I might see about the minimum dosage and see if that does anything, actually. 

I've been taking Lamictal 50 mg since Jan 29, then 100 mg since Feb 19, so it's still kinda new. It's just been killer to adjust to. You're right, I should take it at a regular time and try to be ready for bed at the same time. I've been taking it in the day, sleeping for a few hours in the day, then staying up most of the night. Not sustainable. But, I keep forgetting, and need to stop that. 

Hmmm, mytherapy? I need to get on it! Relying on memory doesn't work, esp if I forget after taking a huge meal, which is the whole point of the meal, lol. 

Ughhh, I'm down too! Anything without these stupid side effects. We get enough from just bipolar alone."

bipolar2,fivk1u2,t1_fiv0r4o,1582761855.0,"I see that a little more clearly now. Life is a subjective experience, and everything isn't cuz of bipolar (or whichever illness). Similarly, people do have different relationships to being alone. It is nice to know, or I take some comfort in that fact that, it's less likely to pathologize experiences when remembering we all 'suffer existence' as you said, differently.

bipolar2,fiv04p5,t1_fiut0sz,1582751400.0,"Lol, I definitely did not expect a straight answer, and do appreciate you going into depth with yours. 

I can see how dealing with bipolar can make people prefer to not be alone, and simultaneously why people might choose to actually be alone because of it. Probably not for different reasons either. 

I don't wanna go on diagnosing the people you've mentioned (who aren't diagnosed) alongside ya, and there are people who don't have bipolar who struggle with this some as well, but that does sound like a lot to deal with. 

I wish I weren't so dependent on people, I feel. I need friends. I *can* be alone, but my life just feels bland without people in it. Idk. I can only talk to and think to myself for so long. But, that's just my experience. I'm sorry that you're struggling with wanting to be more alone and not really getting that. It's rough when you have responsibilities like, I guess, a family."

I'm gonna remember to not give in to toxic people, and make sure to let go of any that come my way. This subreddit has been inspiring as well.

bipolar2,fiup3be,t1_fiuncu0,1582745620.0,"Thanks for responding! I feel you so much. I'm realizing I might not be as well as I thought, since this is happening. My mood is pretty stable, and I even felt calm most of this time, besides today of course. 

At the same time, I've started having the same kind of dreams I have when manic and my sense of smell last night was on TEN. I kept smelling food when there was none....one second it'd be barbecue....the next it was oatmeal. Oatmeal persisted for most of the time. No one had cooked anything that day. And, I always get anxiety or paranoia when manic (or mixed manic). So I'm scared now. 

I feel bad, because you congratulated me too soon. I didn't end up doing it. I was close, and found a coffee shop that could work, but it didn't have good outlets, and that's another stressor for me, not knowing I'll be secure in using my laptop the whole time. For some reason, I need that security, or I get anxious. So, I went to my childhood program's brownstone where there's obviously outlets, open space, and I feel a lot more familiarity. I wish I could feel glad at pushing myself, but I just didn't make it this time."
bipolar2,fiuoezg,t1_fiul9z2,1582745255.0,"Thanks for responding! Wow, that's the complete opposite of me, lol.

Ya know, ya might be onto something there. I'm not sure if you saw my edit (guessing no, lol) but, the main gist is I kept feeling anxious in all these different coffee shops with people, while alone, but as I went to more coffee shops, I started to feel better. Then went to one, with so many less people, and felt fine. 'Safe' maybe is the word (just left cuz of no outlets).

I'm at my childhood program's brownstone, where everyone's working. It is so familiar to me (going on 10 years, coming to this place), and I see a few familiar faces, but I spend most of the time myself. I feel at ease. Somehow, something about there being *someone* there (not even that I talk to or really see, just knowing their presence is there, somewhere), while simultaneously being fairly 'alone', or to myself, is like the perfect balance for me. Ya know, aside from being with friends or family. While I'm pretty familiar with most people at the brownstone, I'm not familiar with everyone and there are new faces. But it doesn't phase me.

I also get anxiety (I'm realizing) from things themselves not being 'secure' (ie. I prefer my phone to be at 100% all the time, I DON'T work at places where I'm not guaranteed an outlet for fear my laptop dies, etc. ) so not finding an outlet was additionally distressing to me. Thankfully, all the outlets I need at my brownstone."
BipolarReddit,fiunlnb,t1_fiuh7z5,1582744820.0,"I feel this so heavily. SO heavily. And, I actually still live with someone (they just work an insane amount, so I'm usually home alone). I'm so scared of when I'll actually have to live alone -- how will I cope? YES! It's easier to have someone to bounce ideas off of, force me to leave the house, just have as company. My friends get me out often enough, but they're busy themselves and a lot have left the city, so it's just me often. I'm finding myself very uncomfortable with it."
BipolarReddit,fiunc5q,t1_fiub5j4,1582744677.0,"Thank you so much for commenting! This is honestly the worst (or one of the worst, Idk). I used to have near constant anxiety as a teen, but it's been five years since I've had that. Literally went away nearly overnight (probably more like, over a couple of weeks). No meds. I've had anxiety during episodes, but never outside of one. 

Maybe it's just coming back or something. I usually have no place to be and just stay at home (more of that, 'why should I' thing happening, if not seeing friends or going to an appt), but I've become increasingly dissatisfied with that. (Also diagnosed ADHD actually, what are the odds. Actually, surprisingly common I'm realizing, lol.) 

My body is likely reacting with nausea too. I actually have gastrointestinal issues (at one point, constant trips to the ER), but the 'feel' of nausea from anxiety and discomfort from physical issues is actually different to me. Usually I can tell. Probably because other symptoms accompany the anxiety, like feeling out of breath, or even just feeling pressure in my skin (it's hard to explain). 

I want to get out more and be around people more. And, I have no trouble doing it with my friends. But, doing it alone is really, really hard, I'm finding. Today was awful. I have no idea why."

bipolar,fitatoz,t1_fi409le,1582712555.0,"Hey there! I'm so sorry I'm just responding to you now. It's been a really, really, REALLY crazy few days. Don't apologize for your longer comment!! I asked, lol. Plus, I love long comments (and sadly, love writing them as well, lol)

Ahh, I see. I never knew what I was doing was dissociating till now. Just thought it was something weird to do, but just something I was doing. It is hard to explain, I'm realizing now. It does help to know I'm not alone in doing this. I also can't imagine how difficult flashbacks are, and not knowing what you're remembering, whether you are correctly, whether there's more to the picture, etc. 

Thank you for outlining the differences between bipolar and borderline for me. I do feel sometimes (or maybe more than sometimes) that I've been misdiagnosed, and maybe it's borderline instead. I think part of it's the fear that, 'hey, I was misdiagnosed the first time (MDD), what if this is the same', ya know? 

I don't relate to the fear of abandonment, or need to be perfect (tho, I am a perfectionist when it comes to school, and feel calmer when things are in 'order', like shapes, lines on the road, things on a desk, etc.), and while I weigh people's opinions, I do tend to go my own way. I sometimes weigh people's opinions on the internet too much tho (lol), over my own friends even because I fear sometimes they're just saying what they want me to say and not telling me the truth to not offend me. But, I'm getting better at that. I've never had a romantic partner (I'm ace), so I'm now sure if I could be borderline since that's often how people 'find out' it seems like. I do have very stable, strong friendships, and I have a strong relationship with family, though that hasn't always been the case (wasn't my fault, we all didn't fuck with each other until family therapy, lol). 

I also used to feel very empty all the time, but I also was very depressed most of the time and I know that's one of the symptoms of depression, so Idk. I don't feel 'happy' when manic, but I don't feel exactly empty. Just fake, like I know this energy isn't real. 

I'd say I have a stable sense of self (and usually go back to the same hobbies or interests, or keep the same interests in hobbies I haven't touched yet; I've had the same goals for a career for the past 8 years, my major's just changed 2x when I realized the best way to get to it), and my family and friends would too, but I have terrible issues with self-esteem and self-confidence. 

Although, my therapist of 6 years says I don't have the 'feel' or cluster of borderline symptoms, and the family therapist (on and off) of about 4 years says the same when I asked her, almost word for word. So Idk. I also know that practitioners tend to not diagnose borderline unless it's extremely obvious or dangerous for the person, so I'm not sure if there's bias there either. Can I share my experiences with you, maybe through chat, to see if they resonate? I wonder if I should get a 'third' opinion. I'm fearful that I've been misdiagnosed, and like you said, dual diagnoses do happen, pretty commonly. Especially with bipolar, it seems (although, of course, it is possible to only have one diagnosis as well). I was previously diagnosed with MDD (obviously) and with a milder case of general anxiety, but the anxiety went away completely for almost 5 years. Now, with my episodes, I'm finding increased panic attacks and general sense of anxiety, which my doctor wants to make a note of. The anxiety mostly halts once I'm out of the manic (or mixed) episode, but I guess it's cause for concern. But, if I possibly have borderline too, that's a whole different ballgame. 

You're absolutely right in that borderline hasn't been researched enough. (Dual diagnosis neither). I fear that my practitioners only see a very specific manifestation of borderline in mind when they consider me, and maybe I have a 'quieter' case. Idk. It'd just be nice to get some clarity. I hope to get a proper test on it soon to see."
BipolarReddit,fit9ume,t1_filcw81,1582711241.0,"Hey there, I'm so sorry I haven't replied to you until now. It's been a really crazy few days. 

Thank you so much for going into so much detail! I love learning about other people's experiences, and relating to them, so it means a lot. 

I'm so sorry that you've struggled with intense bullying and abuse at the hands of your brother, first of all. I had struggles with relating to kids in school, and only ever physically fought with my brother, but that's not the same and it was difficult for me even then. No child should have to go through that. 

I was additionally diagnosed with ADHD, impulsive-/hyperactive-type (a sign of what's yet to come?). My doctor believes it checks out since, looking back on it, I was definitely in a euthymic mood during the testing, and I've since been on medications and still struggled with ADHD symptoms, but I get it, it is the go to diagnosis for kids when mental illness is usually what's at play. A lot of the weird things I did, I explained it away with ADHD when, no, that was mania. Full stop. Also get you blocking out having dysthymia at such a young age. It can be traumatic to find out you have chronic mental illness, especially so young, and there's even an element of not understanding what exactly that even means. 

I similarly got the 'why are you so depressed' feedback when I was a teen (tho I had many reasons to be), when not in 'happy' mode. Though, those happy modes were few and far between (my mania is usually either dysphoric or mixed), so it was moreso between 'why are you so depressed?' and 'why are you so angry?' Not really space for anything in between. 

Also went through the whole 'my moods are so much worse than everyone else, why is this happening?' I explained it away with, there was a lot happening at home at the time, but even then. There were other people in school going through a lot, and they were managing much better. I never thought of bipolar though. I just thought they were character flaws, or I couldn't handle myself, or I was 'crazy' without even realizing what crazy could mean. 

I'm so sorry you went through that at 16. That sounds terrifying. The cutting (and the pain to go that far), the manic whims, the eating disorder and body dysmorphia....that's all so severe to go through as a person, but even more when you're just a teen. I'm glad you're mom tried to seek help, but it's a sad fact that antidepressants (especially alone) usually don't help with depression (and if they do, they don't last long), and often propel people into mania.

That's also so beautiful what you're dad did! (I'm in love with nature too, it calms me down.) But it's sadly not exactly what you needed (obviously helped, for that time, but you needed accurate medical treatment, but most people don't think bipolar first, so the diagnosis is always delayed. It's a shame hospitals also don't admit patients when they feel they're at risk. It always seems like they're forcibly admitting people when they don't want it though (now, want and need are different things, but I've heard horror stories where the person really didn't warrant admission, so Idk). It sounds like that hospital stay was terrible even when you went, I can't imagine the constant bleeding, and it's a shame that no one thought to do anything about it because that's VERY dangerous for a woman. Regular periods deplete our iron enough (it fucks me up cuz I'm anemic). Seroquel is a med that does help some with bipolar, but it often comes with it's own challenges, and the constant antidepressants still weren't helping. 

It sounds like that program was a real stabilizing force for you. I'm glad that you did it, and only sad that you couldn't continue. School is hard on people with mental illness, and fellow peers just don't understand. Also feel you about going off meds for weeks at a time, I did the same in my first year (hell, even as recent as a month ago), and it always takes sooooo long to regulate. And in the meantime, the episodes are taking their time. It's agony. 

In some ways, it sucks when therapists sort of 'abandon' you, but it's best they don't keep treating you when they're out of their element. It led to your diagnosis which is the best thing that could've happened, even though it feels like a death sentence. It felt like that for me too. That I'd be unlovable (while already feeling pretty unlovable), this is the disease that people fear and stigmatize and, yes, make fun of, and I was doing stigmatizing of my own (that's internalized in all of us) by saying '*that* bipolar?? *That's* what I have?? No way!!' (Meanwhile, how do you explain my behavior? The fucked up shit I've done?) 

I'm so glad that you're doing so much better!! Probably feels like 'finally!' to you. I'm trying to get there, but I'm on my way. (I'm titrating up on lamotrigine as we speak, lol, and am on geodon. I liked abilify more but it 'pooped out' on me, surprising enough). It is really weird that the program never mentioned that possibility, but professionals do veer away from diagnosing bipolar in teens, so I guess I see it. Could've saved a lot of pain though. 

It's always a work in progress on the shame that we feel in our diagnoses, and the understanding that it's lifelong management. But I feel, the better we manage, the less we feel it and moreso it's just like, I don't know, another part of our life. At least, that's the dream, for me. That's amazing you found your love! And have a good support system to get through the paranoia (I've only had paranoia a few times when manic, and that shit fucks me up even for weeks after I 'get over' it, so I really feel for you). 

Thank you so much again for sharing your story with me, and I'm so glad it has a 'happy' ending, so to speak. It gives me hope. From a youngin (I'm 22 myself lol) to another, I'm wishing you light and joy and continuous love from this point onward."

I feel the same way! Looking back, I don't know how I could've missed all the signs. And somehow, it's still hard to believe it's the truth, even nearly 2 years out from diagnosis. It's a rough path.

It's been a LONG few days, for other reasons, but on the school front I've decided on my time away I'm gonna peel back and try to do a couple classes a term at my local college and really hone in on my mental health plan so I feel better situated. I think creating an environment where I'm not in the deep end all the time while getting adequate help will help me in deciding if long term, this makes sense. For now, I'm gonna keep trying :)

I've also decided, I think I'm transferring schools. It'll be a lot to make work, but my own psychologist said she's NOT writing me a letter to return there (which is the primary letter needed in order to come back after my medical leave) because she feels medically irresponsible letting me go back to a place that has shown time and time again they don't offer me support. Sooooo....everyone's telling me to leave, aside from 1 or 2 people, I might as well go.

I totally get you with the first feel of mania. Everything feels amazing at the start, like life finally comes together. I, like all of us, also become a different person. My mom recently told me she's so happy that I'm finally, calmly, relaxingly happy for once. I'm always, as she explained it, 'chiggy chiggy chiggy chiggy chiggy chiggy' (she says it really fast, while wailing her arms), basically, like a motor working itself on fumes, when usually 'happy' (re: manic). I'm still doubting my diagnosis and want to get an official psych test to just prove it to myself, once and for all. My family was surprised, because of how they perceived bipolar to be (ie. the media, etc.), but they weren't shocked when they thought more of it because something had been so WRONG with me this whole time. 

Though, there are some things mania gave/gives me that I would never do on my own. It sounds like it's done some similar things for you, like living out your truth while trans. I can sometimes be thankful for that, at least."
bipolar,fikt14r,t3_f8d909,1582486733.0,"Okay, here's my history, lol:

Nothing really happened until I was 16. I'd try and miss school when I was younger, because I often felt sick.

I've dealt with a lot of trauma, a lot of loss. Core family members dying every 3 members, a housefire, mom's sickness, brother's sickness, mom's unemployment as a teen, ALL the issues with my father (and his own sickness and death), near foreclosure....those are just SOME of the heavy hitters. Haven't even gotten to the smaller stuff. 

So, a lot of it started when I was 16 (I'm 22 now). I just thought suddenly getting depressed was reactions to those things, and also to a really stressful school environment (went to boarding school). Once, I impulsively swallowed a bunch of pills cuz I risked getting a school demerit, then immediately told the nurses and was sent away (no hospitalization). Thought nothing of it. The depressions always lasted 2-3 months, felt terrible, but would eventually lift. And, I never got em in the summer. I was always very productive and happy in the summers. 

Eventually, my depressions would trade off and I'd get increasingly angry and agitated. Storm my campus, want to pick fights, trash my room, stand outside in blizzards crying at a flag pole, stuff like that. I'd also do strange things to get a rush at times, like going into Blizzard Juno with no coldwear on, for a few hours outside, because I wanted ice cream. Things like that. Not really crazy, but odd. 

I was also dealing with a lot of physical health challenges at the time (gastrointestinal issues, severe asthma, always fainting) so that didn't help. 

I'm getting to college, and things are getting more erratic. I'd ridden the trains throughout the night in NYC (my home) one day towards the end of high school (switched schools at this point), just cuz I felt like it. 

At college, my first year, I had a manic episode where I got through a term's worth of work in 2 weeks, after not doing it at all (was depressed, hated my school, got a concussion, etc.). Thought nothing of it. Then was depressed for a couple months, thought it was all cuz I hated the school. Had a few weeks of great productivity and mood, thought nothing of it. Then, had a bad mixed episode (shaved my head, barged into my chem lecture sopping wet from taking a shower w/clothes on right before, going on rants outside to my friends' horror on the stupidity of classmates I didn't even know, etc.) I was developing paranoia and dreams that still felt real long after I had them, and decided this isn't normal. Booked an early ticket home, missed finals, then plunged into a depression where I saw sepia and my psychomotor function was disrupted (much slowed). I told my mom again I felt like ending things, and I'm finally hospitalized. There I get my bipolar diagnosis, then I switch, nearly overnight, to mania while in the hospital and they heavily sedate me to bring me down (gotta love Haldol, among others). 

Since then, it's been a mix of mania, mixed episodes, and depressions (and suspected rapid cycling). One depression lasted 8 months. Still in the same cycles of, not able to do hw for most of the term (depressed), and then make it all up in a couple weeks when hypo/manic. I want to get better at that. 

 The SSRIs never worked for me, but no one ever thought that maybe there's something wrong with that. Everyone attributed my depressions to being situational because I always had so much going on, and school was stressful. 'Everyone's depressed these days.' No one thought it could be biochemical.

I'm still surprised, and largely deny it to myself on the daily, despite taking my meds. But I know what I'm like when off meds. Besides being the girl who makes up a lotta work in no time and has all these ideas for jobs and shit, I'm also the girl that just...can't get it together. And drags everyone down in the process. Makes people scared for me. I don't want to do that anymore, and so meds here I come."

bipolar2,fikptoa,t1_fiko1ah,1582484962.0,"Oh my gosh!! I can relate SO heavily to this. Starting at 16, I was the 'depressed' teen, who when not depressed, was angry, or bombastic even. I also did the whole walking at night thing. I think it was a lot of depression and mixed episodes for me too. 

Never did drugs or cutting, but can relate to wanting to do anything to get rid of the pain. I had my first major depressive episode earlier, but they'd only last 2-3 months at most. I had my first scary scary depressive ep when I was 20, it had psychotic elements to it. Then, depressed for 8 months straight as well. My depressive episodes could get scary before those two, but those ones really shook me. At one point, I wanted to die every day, but it was resigned. Like, waking up and saying 'Oh, I'm still here? So sad.' I wish I'd never wake up, but knew I couldn't actively do that to my family, so I just felt trapped. 

Also had the intense rapid cycling, but that was moreso post diagnosis. (and a little right before). A lot of your experience resonated with me.

I'm wishing you luck with this diagnosis. It doesn't define us (something I'm trying to believe every day), and now that we know the monster that's been fucking with us, it should be a lil easier to confront it. I hope you gain stability starting now."
bipolar2,fikp28z,t1_fiko20a,1582484543.0,"Ahhh, I can see how that could happen. I've been seeing the same psychologist off and on for 6 years (I'm 22, so since I was 16 basically), but I only see her when I'm home. I went to boarding school, and then obviously college, so she didn't see my cycles. And the schools never noticed either, when I sought treatment there (treatment which was a bit shit, if I'm being honest).

It was a 'oh, she's just getting better' thing, until I got worse. Since I did terribly in the winter (when school started revving up), and I've never had a depressive summer (when there's no school), they must've thought, 'oh, she's just reacting badly to school, school's a stressor'. Which, school is a stressor, but that's not the whole picture. I'm never depressed in the summers because I tend to go manic, or euthymic, depending. And having depression in winter and mania in summer is common in people with bipolar. 

Ahhh, I see. I feel that wholeheartedly on the hypomanic symptoms lol.

The ONCE I took clonazepam, I knocked the fuck out, and the few months I was on depakote were the death of me, I DEMANDED to be taken off. I'm sorry you had to deal with that too :(

It really only takes one practitioner to realize what makes sense. I'm glad you found out in the depth of the worst one and before it was too late. Do you have hypomanic symptoms that all these practitioners before just weren't registering?

BipolarReddit,fikl9fa,t1_fhw1cg9,1582482471.0,"So sorry, I went off reddit for a few days and I'm just now replying to people! I feel that. The permanence of it. I actually retroactively withdrew from a semester before, with the intention of returning (had a really bad mixed episode that led to me being diagnosed and had to leave school early, then cuz of treatment couldn't finish incompletes). I think I actually should've gotten it as a medical withdrawal too since I cited medical reasons for needing it....hmm. 

I think you're right, I was 'feeling good,' but I don't think I really reached a good place. If I had, I would've been stable once I wasn't feeling good anymore. A lot of that involved the school I'm in (I fucking hate it, so can't feel good for too long with that), but also meds, and probably not enough coping skills to manage things. 

I'm gonna try and see if I can go back and get that medical withdrawal. My school actually forced me off campus on a medical leave this time around, so I'm not enrolled in a semester rn. I don't really have the luxury of extra time, but I might not have any other choice! It's been my dream since 8 years old to go to college (and get a degree), and it looks like it'll just end up taking a lot longer for me to do it, if I decide to.

That's so true, we gotta stay with today. I've realized that my today varies a LOT. It almost doesn't make sense to forecast 10 years down, 20 years down, even 2 years down, etc. based on the variability and unpredictability of today. I've been up, and down. Productive, and not. Hopeful, and bleak. But the next day, something changes again, even a little bit. Staying in the present and trying to salvage it gives us back some control. 

This is very true. I wanted to drop out, in spite of not failing my fall semester. I completed over half a term's worth (in some cases, over two months worth) of courses in about 3 weeks. And I didn't fail. I still wanted to drop out. I couldn't even think of being thankful for that. I didn't even think of my relationship with my mom, which is quite strong. And, I know I'm lucky to even be able to say that. 

I might look into a young adult's IOP, that's a good idea. Hopefully they have some DBT there because I do think I need to develop skills in emotional regulation. 

I'm so happy that things are going so much better for you :) and it must mean a lot, considering you put in a lot of effort into that, a lot of work. You actively made it happen. I want to do that for myself. 

Thank you so much for your words. You communicated so much. Hope is really important, and I want to learn to keep it when it gets really, really bleak. I feel a lil better now from when I posted, but I know other days I'll feel worse, so I really have to learn on that."

Wow, thank you so much for taking the time to write your reply (like that other commenter said). I really appreciate it. 

That example of Moses and the Israelites is really impactful. Like, I legit gained hope from seeing it in that way. I've heard it a million times, but never thought to apply it to my own experiences, or think of the severity of what they're going through and the type of resolve and faith that you need to have to get through that kind of experience. 

I want to have hope, and plan for my future. I want to reach the promise land. 

It's also inspiring to think that, even if my condition/circumstances get worse (and it really does feel like life/God is beating up on me, most of the time), that I was never promised to get something better, but that doesn't mean it can't happen. And maybe it's part of my journey to be the person I need to be, to be able to make the most out of progress and success. My experiences have changed my understanding of the world, and my empathy, and I'm thankful for that. To be the person I think I want to be in this world, I need that. Loads of it. And you're right, I'll never get there if I do give up. And I do want to get there. 

I never thought of my challenges as spiritual trainings, to make me stronger and more flexible in experiences. There are things I've dealt with in the past that made it easier to deal with things in the present. That has happened for me. I'm hoping this experience I'm going through right now, is preparing me. Because I don't know what's in the future, and it hurts not to know and not to know what to expect. If I should even expect.

Thank you so much for your belief in me, even though you don't know me. I've been trying to look for a 'way out' because I don't want to have to trudge through. But, to be successful in life, you have to trudge through. And, if I can be comfortable with the fact that I will fail and I can get back up, I think things will be okay. That's my biggest fear and biggest hangup. I'm scared any one failure will be the death of me. I'm scared to fail, even though I've failed so much. Since I've seen a lack of progress, I attribute that to my failures, even though there are so many reasons for them. It's not very forgiving to not plan for those possibilities and opportunities to grow. 

I'm so thankful of your time and your message. And your belief and the love you've shown me through this comment. I've read over it multiple times, to really take it in. Thank you."

I'm technically on medical leave now, so I can take a breather, but I can't really 'relax' until April for other reasons. Between that, and possibly needing to take summer courses in June if I wanted to meet up, that's no break at all. It's overwhelming."
BipolarReddit,fhvcghy,t1_fhv8wfg,1581895856.0,"Once you hear my answer, you'll probably suggest the trade school option even quicker. My major is political science, and I want to go into public health; maybe not directly into third or public sector, but find some way to touch upon it, even if I'm working in private sector. I mainly chose politics cuz I can do a lot of studies on social determinants of health and how economics factor in via that history of political science, and all my 'nonpolitical' (aka health-centered classes) count, without having to take on a major like bio or chem. I was originally a chem major, but the makeup on labs is damn near impossible post-episode. Humanities majors are a lil more forgiving of that. 

I am in the US! I honestly might try that, a mix of classes at both. I want to see how a combo like that would work actually. The dean might not be as flexible to that, but maybe I can work around her if she's not. There might be a way. 

Thanks for that suggestion on the trade schools! I'll look into that. 

I'm receiving therapy at home 2x a week, but at school (if I do choose to go back cuz things drastically change), I'll look into those sites! Noting them down now. Thank you :)"

I've also done cool things like win 3rd place in a national track competition with no coach. Those are the ones I feel like sharing for now. Not cool, but not what I'd ever expect, really.

bipolar,fhv7c04,t1_fhugm58,1581894083.0,"Ahhh, I see. I don't actually think I dissociate when in 'characters' mode (which is my regular mode lol), my therapist described it as me compartmentalizing my thoughts into the characters to help me make sense of my brain. Unless, what is dissociation like for you, with the characters? Maybe I do that too and I'm not realizing my experience is the same/is actually dissociating. 

I don't really find that I daydream, I don't think. (Again, maybe I'm not realizing.) But, fairly often, I go out on walks and silently talk to myself through these characters to work through a problem. I almost imagine that I'm just alone in the world with them, and we're kinda suspended in space. At that moment, I'm only thinking of that problem, and the different perspectives to it 'through' them. 

Ahh, I see. Can I ask you about your experiences with both? I'm wondering if my bipolar is actually borderline or I'm possibly comorbid. 

Ahh, I see! I didn't know about that. Oh, wow, I'm so sorry that movie was so much :( Flashbacks and vivid memories can't be fun. I've actually never had flashbacks or vivid memories about any events that could've caused this. Just known I've always done it. And, thank you <3"

I do really need to learn to not listen to my emotions and thoughts, and to find better supports as well. My mom stays telling me I need to practice more gratitude in my life, so I guess I should start there.

I'll try watching a movie, thanks for suggesting that. Today, I was blasting all the music I listen to when I feel hopeless and sad, but I'll try listening to music that makes me feel happier. Or taking a nap to ASMR videos to relax. 

I want to start DBT! Like, intensive DBT. I really do need to improve my distress tolerance honestly. (Does DBT also work for bipolar? I always thought it was a thing for borderlines.

I had an off-campus therapist over the fall, but she wasn't very helpful and, at the end of my school's 8-session-per-year limit (reached in late November), said she'd have to stop seeing me. I just so happened to mention a suicidal thought in the 2nd to last session, we did a risk assessment and determined I was low risk (hadn't had suicidal thoughts for over a year before then, and haven't had a single thought since). Still, she said she'd have to see me more like 2x a week, and since she knew I couldn't afford it, she suggested a php. I asked if I could just see my person at home 2x a week since I was going home soon, she said that's fair that could work. Next thing, she's told my dean, dean says the school has to follow her clinical recommendation, and I'm shuttled home within a day. 

I did a reduced course load this semester, but my financial aid only covers 8 terms, so it just means I have to overload the next semester. Even worse, I had to retroactively withdraw from my 2nd term (spring), so I now have to completely 8 terms of coursework in 7 terms. Reduced course loads aren't an option for me anymore.

That's how I've been feeling! I don't get it from most stressors, but big stressors like my school situation, or like a test that determines if I get fin aid back (long story), those just DEAD me and I cry and cry and need to be calmed down by someone else. I really think I have to look more into DBT, I really need to incorporate some emotion regulation. 

Thank you so much for understanding <3 It really is fucked up!! I'm so sorry you had to go through that too. That's SO difficult, and I can truly relate. I feel like never going back, but I might have to because of costs. 

I also feel like I'm judged whenever I say I don't want to go back. Everyone always looks at mental illness as a reason to say the person suffering is shallow or being difficult/not trying hard enough...my brothers, and people on here, tell me to just 'toughen up' about my college, when if someone neurotypical realizes they don't like a school, they just transfer and it's fine. They're allowed to do that. 

They're not judged, and they get the chance to enjoy the next place. But, when someone with mental health issues realizes they don't like a place AND the place is either negatively impacting their mental health, or is just putting a lot of pressure on their ability to get through, they're said to have no skills and the 'real world is tough' and 'you just have to deal'. Essentially, 'no transfer for you'

I wonder why that is. I know I'll probably have to go back, but it's hard to find people agree that I'm a 'weakling' for saying I don't want to."

Do you have any advice, for gaining these skills, if you've gone through anything like what I've gone through? I've tried some CBT and DBT methods. I've consistently gone to therapy, I take my meds. I talk things out with people, I try to rationalize, I usually don't get angry. I go on walks, go out in nature, meditate, listen to calming ASMR videos. Get sleep. Nothing works. I don't know how to gain these skills, and everything I'm doing clearly isn't enough, so I don't know where to go from here. 

That's true. It's just, I've been engaged with treatment, and there's not much else the school will do for me past what they've done this year. Maybe I just need to deal with that, accept that they can only do so much and I'll have to figure out most of this stuff on my own. My mom doesn't even have a stable insurance, and it's not the best, so I can't really switch to her plan and expect a lot, but maybe I can try to see a psych professional at a nearby hospital. The school psychiatrist just helps with med management; they don't like to change meds even when something's wrong, they just write the same scripts for you. Maybe I can convince him better next time. 

You're right. I've allowed failure, particularly quitting, to become an option to myself. I've failed repeatedly (even when I said, I WILL win), and gotten back up, but doing that so many times has put a strain on me. Then again, I can't get it into my mind that that's the last time, and that success is over for me. 

My family has helped a lot since I returned home. I know I'll miss that support, and I'm the only one of my siblings who ventured far away from home so I'm the only one who's dealt with this. Maybe they can find a way to visit me more at school or something, but really the solution would be for me to be able to make it on my own. I just don't know if I can do that. I HATE that I'm so dependent on others to be able to get through my own shit. I hate it so much.

Bipolar really does come and mock you, discourage you, and scare you. It's done all 3 to me. I keep trying to say, it doesn't own me, and internalizing that, but these episodes still overpower me.

I really do."
BorderlinePDisorder,fhrhfe5,t1_fhqqcwn,1581826321.0,"Thank you for responding! You're kind to describe me in that way. 

I think that's part of why I reacted so strongly, as well. I was so tied to leaving and genuinely happy to get away from this place (for 3 months, I've been feeling this way; have hated this college since my first 2 weeks there), that realizing it's not likely I can, was a really crushing blow (in addition to, ya know, poor stress management). 

My school only offers 8 off campus sessions (up to $75 per session) of therapy over the whole school year. The school insurance is shit, and when I tried to go that route, it wouldve had me out of at least $600 out of pocket, just to start making it work (thanks deductible). Lots of people are forced to go off campus because the school psychological services are often booked 3 months out starting from the beginning of the school year. 

I found a place, where I was seeing someone, $25 outta pocket each time with the school subsidy. By the end of my 8 sessions, simultaneously when I mentioned 1 suicidal thought (hadn't had one for over a year and a half, and haven't had a single one SINCE), she said she needed to see me closer to 2x a week, but knows I couldnt afford it. She recommended a php program, and when I asked if I can just see my reg psychologist at home 2x a week when I got back home (which would be a week later), she said that can work. 

Cue my Dean finding out literally that same day (they got me to sign a ferpa to her while manic that I forgot about, I know, nice one pyschsweets), telling me I HAVE to leave on medical leave immediately per the doctors recommendation. They weren't  even gonna let me finish my classes remotely. 

I'm scared to try psych services at this school again. They're expensive, they're limited, they're overbooked, and worse off because of my experience I can't trust them. I'm realizing I never should have, but it hurt that I finally was trying to problem solve the right way, let these people in and find help right away, and I felt punished for it. Almost cast away for something I didnt even deal with again. 

I want to return, but its gonna take a lot of gameplan and no wiggle room for someone who's still new in her diagnosis (I'm talking about bipolar here officially, tho I'm worried I potentially have borderline since some things dont completely add up). Because I had to retroactively withdraw from my spring semester, to keep that scholarship and financial aid, I need to finish 6 terms worth of courses in 5 terms. That's overloading 2x in my remaining 5 semesters, and that's not including the 2 courses each I need to take during 2 different summers to graduate on time to keep my aid. (Then the question is, how do I pay for those courses, if I cant work during those summers, because I'm taking those courses?) If I deviate from this plan at all, I violate my fin aid contract and its lost forever. Its debatable if they even returned my aid since I had to submit an appeal, due to them revoking it very recently. 

It just feels very unfeasible for someone struggling with mental illness and poor reactions to stress/hiding anxiety. Sure, could I do it? Maybe. But not without more hospitalizations and probably more forced medical leaves against my will. 

Do you still think I can do it? If so, then maybe I'll keep trying. But it just seems so insurmountable. The kicker is my school is 3000 miles away from home and my closest relative lives a 3 hour plane ride away. I'm alone there basically, isolated, and all my friends I started with are graduating while I'm on leave. I still have 3 years to go.

But, the alternative is massive student loan debt. I feel trapped."

BipolarReddit,fhr3fsg,t1_fhr2h3n,1581816342.0,"I didnt think of seeing someone specifically who works with BPD (I'm assuming you mean bipolar here; please correct me if I'm wrong!)

I was diagnosed with bipolar in the hospital, and I've been titrating up on Lamictal. I felt stable for 2 weeks, but then this happened. Even, my mood still feels fine, just the reaction happened. I'm still not quite at therapeutic dose, and I think i was in. A bad mixed ep beforehand, so I might still be in it and it breaking through. 

I'm gonna talk to my doc and see what to do."
bipolar2,fhqvz14,t1_fhqv4n9,1581812432.0,"I'm not saying I don't overreact and have issues with problem solving. I also said I understand that my mental health played a big role in not succeeding at my schools, especially my current school, in the way that I'd like. But, I'm pretty sure I'm not overreacting to what literally happened. The facts do not conflict. 

You did not offer problem solving suggestions. You were confused by what I was saying, I explained the situation, then you said that I need to stop 'scapegoating' someone for actions they did, and told me to 'toughen up'. That's not problem solving. That's just invalidating my experience. 

Say that I overreact to things, sure, but I'm not denying events that actually happened. Nor am I looking for sympathizers, but I know I'm not looking for someone who immediately calls me paranoid and says 'it's all the bipolar' before even hearing the whole situation. 

Thanks for finding my pain funny. Nice one, that."
bipolar2,fhqsmjw,t1_fhqqie6,1581810518.0,"I dont really see how my story has changed here. I've included more details, not in conflict with each other, but the crux of it is she did not respond in a proper way regarding those losses that she had access to info about. 

I never said it was my Dean's fault for the concussion. I specifically named the school in that action, the dean wasnt even there at that time. But, the school placing me in off campus housing and giving me a bike without a helmet that I needed to get to classes on time, led me to biking down a curb to get from those apartments to my class, which did indirectly lead to the concussion. I never said they directly lead to that, but without that happening, no concussion would be there.

 Never blamed her for my bipolar, I'm not sure where that's coming from. but I was forced on leave when I was doing fine. Because I had to go on leave, that I did not want to do, that violated my fin aid and directly caused me to get my scholarship revoked. Since I couldnt finish those classes on time, because I was placed on leave, it got revoked. 

I am not blaming them for everything, but it's unfair to not recognize I've been done a raw deal here.

I dont have issues with dealing with someone I dont like. I stayed 6 years at a hs I hated, because I know how to grit my teeth and get through things. If you really think this school handles things the right way, and everything is my fault, and I shouldn't feel some type of way about that, that's fine. You're entitled to that. But I'm not a person who cant handle tough situations when it comes to it. 

The reason I want to transfer isnt because of my experiences with that dean, not how I've been treated by this school, or even that I hate it there. The main reason is that it makes no sense going to school 3000 miles away from home supports, to a school that does not offer appropriate physical health or psychological services options for its students (both of which I need), that I feel stagnant at. The reality is, if I'm not set up to thrive at this place, it doesnt matter what brute forcing will do. I have to be realistic about what I'm dealing with here too. 

I've been through a lot of adversity in my life besides my health issues, and I have all my life to learn better ways to deal with people. I dont see why wanting 3 years of a break from that is such a problem."
