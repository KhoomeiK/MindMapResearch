But as far as P5R is concerned, most (if not all) of the new quality of life changes to the combat have really just dropped the difficulty significantly.

Overall I'd still give the game a 10/10. I'd just recommend playing on the highest difficulty since the standard normal difficulty is even easier than the vanilla version."

But that's exactly how Democracy should work. The way you influence politicians isn't by not voting, that is a ridiculous claim that is grounded in any reality. The way you influence them is by changing the political landscape, which as a voter can only be achieved by moving the Overton window closer to your side or not let it slide any further. 

Funny how we've tried your exact strategy you're advocating for for the past few decades, and the Overton window in America as constantly creeped ever and ever more to the right. See, what happens when you constantly compromise with the right-wing on every issue is the right gets 60% and the left gets 40%. The right get 70% and the left gets 30%. So on and so forth. That's why wages have been stagnant since the 1980's, why climate change has only gotten worse, why student loan debt is higher than it's ever been, etc etc. We keep fucking caving on every issue moving further and further right. You're acting as if we haven't tried your strategy. We have, and it's so far been total shit.

>If you don't vote, nothing is going to change. You are basically arguing that sitting around long enough will yield some change from the outside, but the only thing that will happen is that people outside will ignore you. 

If you think I'm just advocating for not voting and nothing else, you're wrong. We need to organize mass protests, general strikes, boycotts, march on Washington, and run candidates who *actually* represent working class people, and then vote for *them.* Just not voting and nothing else is not what I'm advocating for. If anything I consider not voting (for shitty establishment candidates) to be just another form of protest or boycott, etc.

>Progressives have to show that they're not a liability, but instead a wing that the DNC can count on, work their way up and then change the system from within.

What you're advocating for is simply unhistorical and backed up by nothing. Literally every major political movement in recent history has been motivated by the very means I just described. The French Revolution, Abolishon of Slavery, Women's Suffrage, the Civil Rights Act of the 60's, etc etc. All of which massive political movements done by outside forces pressuring politicians to act from the outside.

>What you're proposing is complacency, you're doing nothing but expecting results. Again, this point has been brought up ad nauseam. 

Well clearly now you know I'm not advocating for complacency, but no point you've made has been made ""ad nauseam."" At least not yet anyway.

>As for the leverage argument, you have none. You lost it the moment you showed to be unreliable. Leverage is only useful when you have something to give and if that something cannot be obtained through other means with similar difficulty. Half the country doesn't vote, and progressives show times and times again that they're too hard to get on their side (note how you actually shifted from a ""will of the people"" to a ""whatever gives them more votes"" argument), so in terms of both cost-benefit and risk analysis, the DNC would move away if we don't vote. Or put very simply: why would they try to appeal to us, if we're never satisfied enough to vote (and this goes beyond Biden), so they'll just look for other audiences that they'll appeal to.

Again, you're acting as if not voting is all I'm advocating for when it's not. I'm advocating for political activism on top of not voting for their shitty candidate. That is the only way to get them to realize they have a massive demographic who's politically active but won't vote for them so long as they keep representing corporate interests. Seriously man, this isn't rocket science.

>This ^ is why the lesser of two evils argument keeps holding. Beyond the fact that you actually didn't address it, you just said again why you don't like it with nothing that actually defies the argument. You tried to deviate it by saying ""not my philosophical stance"", but that makes as much sense as saying ""I don't agree with your opinion because it's not my opinion"", when the whole point is to debate those opinions.

Most of this I've already addressed above, but I'll simply express to you a simple fact of reality. Fact is, scolding people for not voting for the lesser of two evils is not a good motivating tool to convince people to vote for your candidate. If you want your candidate to win, then you need to do everything you can to make them less shitty and to actually address our concerns if you're looking to win our votes. I'm not arguing what's morally right or wrong, or what somebody should or shouldn't do; I'm arguing that as a means of campaign strategy, your current political strategy is absolute dog shit. You won't win elections that way. You won't win votes that way. I'm telling you that if you want someone like Joe Biden to win because you just gotta have the least shitty candidate, then you need to consider ways in which to pressure that candidate to address our concerns as well as ways to market that candidate to us that don't involve scolding people online for not wanting to vote for a rapist war criminal sociopath.

>So let me get back to the 1st point where I still have some questions. It's not about whether you're a consequentialist or not, but if we were to assume it is, what's your answer to the trolley problem? And by that I mean the following trolley problem: the train is moving at fast speed, there are 1 million people on the rails. There is a lever that activates the train's brakes. If it's on the right, all people die, if it's on the left no one dies. Unfortunately, some mischievous people rigged that damn thing, now it's stuck in the middle somewhere and won't go fully to the left. You can pull it at most somewhat to the left. Really, you don't know how much that will affect anything, but it seems like pulling it as much left as possible will increase the probability of saving some lives, while letting it the way it is will highly probably kill those 1M. What do you do?,

I don't consider that particular dilemma to be 100% analogous to voting for Biden (as I'll explain in a minute), but to answer your question: Yes, in this instance I would pull the lever. The reason being that the way you worded it differently to how this dilemma is usually expressed is not primarily a choice of *who* lives, but of *how many.* 

See, the way this dilemma is usually presented is: ""There's a runaway trolley barreling down a track that if left on it's current course will kill five people, but if you pull the lever it will switch and kill one. Do you pull the lever?"" The subtle difference here is the fact that the people who'd die are at the end of the tracks, whereas in your example the people are in the train that's out of control. This may not seem like a huge difference, but it actually is. By pulling the lever in your example I'm potentially saving lives and killing no one, whereas in the more common way this dilemma is presented, by pulling the lever I'm actively killing someone to save a few others. That's a rather different dynamic at play. 

Under this scenario, I would personally choose to not act and let the five die, and I would expect no less from anyone else. Because to actively sentence another innocent person to death to save the lives of others is an act my moral philosophy strongly opposes. I don't believe that people should actively harm innocent people, no matter if it's for the ""greater good."" Thus, not acting is the morally right thing to do under this scenario. The way in which you presented it was not a way in which anyone is actively sentenced to death, and thus I believe under those conditions, I would strongly support pulling the lever.

Now lastly I'll explain how this relates to Biden. Biden will actively kill innocent people. That's a fact. He's fully in favor of continuing imperialistic wars overseas that kill innocent people, and even more blood will be on his hands. I don't believe it to be right based on the philosophy expressed above to actively assist in putting him in the white house, knowing that he'll use his power to kill innocent people. This is once again, a difference of moral philosophy."
seculartalk,fpeu4e2,t1_fpeh7hq,1588554980.0,"*(I'll have to split this into two parts, so bear with me)*

>You assume that the lesser of two evils is a result of purely consequentialist philosophy, which it isn't. It isn't purely about maximising the well-being of people. It is also in the interest of a progressive movement, an argument that has been laid out ad nauseam. 

Then make that argument, because I've yet to hear it.

>The other thing is that you can argue as much as you want about ""not doing an evil in the first place"", but the reality is one of the evils is going to happen, and by not acting you are choosing to enable the greater evil. So you are making a choice, which is to grant a higher chance to the greater evil.

Yes. I (generally) agree. This is what I mean when I say this is a difference of philosophy. I am okay with a potentially greater evil resulting as a consequence from my (or anyone else's) inaction because I philosophically believe people to have the fundamental right to not act if they so choose. I am not solely concerned with maximizing happiness and pleasure and the general well being. There are other things I value just as much if not more which at times contradict that notion, such as: personal freedom and autonomy, basic human rights, and not knowingly causing direct harm to others, etc. Consider me a consequentialist with a few deontological leanings. Our disagreement is a disagreement over basic moral values.

>So this isn't even about consequentialism, consequentialism could only tell you which of the two would be more evil, and nothing else. 

Bullshit. Moral philosophies literally are all prescriptive by nature; meaning they tell us what we *ought* to do. They don't just describe the greater and lesser evils, etc. This is basic beginners philosophy 101.

>You already agree that one is more evil than the other and thus philosophically concede that one is more moral than the other. 

Actually, I think Biden is even worse than Trump on multiple issues. The two are nearly identical. Though if I had to make a very rough estimate, I'd say Biden is overall *just barely* better than Trump. But not by much.

Regardless, no, I don't ""concede"" that ""one is more moral than the other."" They're both immoral. Just *ever so slightly* different degrees of immoral, but still immoral. Again, I have different moral values than you. I don't believe supporting Biden is in any way the morally right thing to do, because I don't value doing things that directly cause harm to anyone, even if it's a lesser harm than what may result by not acting. You're welcome to disagree with me here and you may personally value maximizing well being or at least limiting suffering at all costs, but I don't. And there isn't anything that can really alter a person's basic moral values like that.

>I'm going to ignore the blatant absurdity that all these people just have these principled fundamental philosophical difference, you and I know that's not true, they're just malding.

Most people may not be able to so eloquently express their philosophical differences, but you don't have to be able to. Everyone holds basic moral values of some kind (or lack thereof), whether they're able to put it to words or not.

>I'm also going to ignore that nobody bring this up ever (probably because it's a bad faith argument, and because as shown above it doesn't hold), so my inital comment still holds, nobody ever debunks it, though I appreciate you trying.

Please note that I'm merely trying to express to you an opposing viewpoint, and I'm not here just trying to ""win"" anything. The above quote wreaks of just trying to win at a competitive debate, and I really hate that shit. We'll more than likely be at an impasse regardless (since again, we hold different values), so just know that if your motives are to just win an argument rather than actually make one, I'll stop this discussion right here.

>You are assuming that your will is the will of the people. People have chosen, they chose Biden over Bernie.

Yeah, and then they'll most likely choose Trump over Biden. Mainly because Trump *actually* represents the will of his Republican base, whereas Biden's entire campaign platform seems to just simply be: ""I'M NOT TRUMP"" and ""TRUMP BAD.""

Baby boomers dominated the Democratic primary voting (especially considering they had specific advantages to be able to do so that young people did not), and Boomers basically just want to beat Trump. They're personally comfortable and don't care about policy, they just think Trump bad, so must beat Trump. Their will has been decided. 

Now when it comes to the general election, will 'Trump bad' be enough to actually get Biden to beat Trump? I highly doubt it considering most polls indicate Trump's base of support to be highly enthusiastic to vote Trump whereas Biden's base is far far less enthusiastic to vote Biden comparatively. But we shall see."
seculartalk,fpeij6e,t1_fpeguup,1588548217.0,">And when did I defend Biden? 

By claiming that he supposedly ""showed remorse"" when he clearly didn't. Stopping mid-rape isn't fucking ""remorse."" Remorse would be if he openly admitted his wrongdoing, dropped out, and turned himself into the authorities. Minimizing his sexual assault crime as being ""remorseful"" is pretty damn defensive.

>I am telling you that Voting for Biden is the correct course of action because we are going to get a rapist in the Whitehouse no matter what, and this way we at least get one that showed remorse.

If we're going to get a rapist no matter what, all the more reason to not assist either rapist in obtaining power. We may get another rapist in the white house either way, but at least you didn't assist either one with your support. It's sad and pathetic for anyone to claim that voting for a rapist in any scenario to be ""the right course of action.""

A vote for Biden is +1 vote for Biden. 

A vote for Green party is +1 vote for Green party. 

Not voting for anyone is +0 vote for anyone. 

That's it. There's no 4D voting chess going on here. You can't just make up the rules and say shit like ""not voting Biden is a vote for Trump."" If that's true, then why isn't not voting for Trump considered a vote for Biden? What about people who literally never vote? Who does their non-vote get a +1 non-vote allocated to? What about those who only ever vote 3rd party? Where does their 3rd party vote *actually* go to: Biden or Trump? You see how this whole argument of yours is just made up bullshit?"
seculartalk,fpedzbs,t1_fpeag50,1588545658.0,"Bullshit. We reject the 'lesser of two evils' argument for two reasons: 

1 - We reject it because the argument is a difference in our fundamental moral philosophy, which isn't something that can really be debated, it's just an inherent difference of what we value. Essentially, the 'lesser of evils' is a rather puritanical version of consequentialist philosophy. It's the idea that you MUST act in a way that maximizes the greater good and well being of all humanity, as it is an absolute moral imperative for you to do so. It allows very little room for exceptions. No matter how evil the act is, if it's lesser than something else, then you must commit that evil for the greater good. I and many other people fundamentally reject this philosophy, since we don't just value maximizing well being but also value things such as human rights, and we recognize that no one is a perfect arbiter of what evils are truly the lesser and thus deemed an acceptable evil. Essentially, we have a fundamentally different moral philosophy than you, which simply comes down to our base core values, so making the lesser of two evils argument doesn't sway us in the slightest. We aren't concerned with who the lesser evil is, we're concerned with just not doing evil in the fucking first place.

2 - We reject it because that's simply not how Democracy is supposed to work. The whole point of a Democracy is for a politician to represent the will of the people. If the politician doesn't represent your interest, they don't get your vote. If they eant your vote, they have to choose to support and fight for the things you support, otherwise they don't have enough votes to win and they lose. If they want to win, they're gonna have to support what the majority (or at the very least the plurality) of what the people want. This is how you influence politicians to represent you under a Democracy. The absolute last thing you want to do is to pledge to support whoever the least bad candidate is unconditionally. The only thing that leads to is them walking all over you because they know you'll just support them anyway. Why do anything for you if you'll just support them anyway? This should be common sense. You're sacrificing the single greatest leverage you have over politicians to act in your interests when you pledge to support them solely on the basis of ""they're fucking us over just s little bit less."" 

This ^ is why we ask you to justify your position beyond just 'the lesser of two evils'. Because that argument is just an absolute bullshit of an excuse for you to support what is outright blatantly immoral."
seculartalk,fpeatz7,t1_fpe84sp,1588543820.0,">Oh my god. How old are you? or are you just this ignorant. 

Dude, you're demonstrating that you don't even understand how the basic principles of how a Democracy is supposed to work. The whole point of a Democratic society is to have politicians represent the people's interests. In order to win an election, they have to convince people to vote for them, and the way you convince people to vote for you is to actually support and fight for the policies that the people voting for you want. If you don't do that, you likely won't get enough votes to win. The candidate who best represents the will of the people wins. Thus politicians under a Democracy are incentivized to represent you, lest they be spared your vote and lose.

I realize that this isn't how the American political system works because the US effectively functions as a corporate oligarchy, however there is still just enough of a Democracy there that still enables this strategy to be effective. Withholding your vote until a candidate finally represents your interests is quite literally one of the only pieces of leverage you have over politicians. The only thing a pledge of unconditional support will lead to is politicians just taking your votes for granted and having no interest to actually concede to give you anything. They could just say ""the other guy is worse"" and you'd just fall in line like a sad little puppy while they continue to step on you. 

I mean honestly, this shit should be obvious. Giving someone unconditional support - be it in a romantic relationship, a business transaction, or a political candidate, etc - naturally will only lead to them treating you like shit since you'll still be there supporting them regardless. It's common sense. So don't even give me this condescending pious bullshit as if unconditionally supporting a rapist war criminal is somehow obvious because ""the other one is worse."" You're the one being childish and stupid. Not me.

>If the left doesn't show up, Trump gets back in. Do you honestly think that a second term Trump is worse or better than Biden?

Trump and Biden are nearly identical, so it doesn't much matter really. I'd actually argue that it's better for Trump to be reelected so we can start over with some other progressive in 4 more years as opposed to another 8 years of neoliberalism."

We get 4 more years of the exact same neoliberal corporate centrist policies that only ever escalate the same problems we're currently dealing with now and that we've tried a thousand times before, and then either 4 more years of neoliberalism on top of the original 4, or 4 more years of some other Republican.

>And even if every single leftist abstained from voting, the dnc would not change their ways at all. We do not have any leverage like you said. The only thing we can and should do is use voting as a tool to have less people die or be harmed.

That's just not historically accurate. FDR caved and started implementing policies to help the working class after massive civil protests started in the wake of the great depression. LBJ enacted the Civil Rights Act after MLK and other leftist protests pressured him to act in their favor. Literally every major leftist political movement in recent history has been motivated by the very means I just described and has been successful. We absolutely have leverage, you're just acting like a defeatist coward who's willing to settle for slightly less abuse.

They're already being sacrificed, and they will continue to be sacrificed if not more so under Biden. What I'm advocating for is the only thing that actually has the potential of saving some people. Otherwise you're putting faith into a system that's fundamentally rigged against us.

>You have another point where biden would be short term harm reduction and would only lead to more harm in the future. I disagree with that only because the trump presidency comes at a critical point in the progression of climate change. Slowing climate change sooner than later is definitely less harm.

Biden won't do anything meaningful to curb climate change because he's funded by the same fossil fuel companies. Not to mention how 4 to 8 yrs of Biden's inaction plus 4 yrs of some other Republican's inaction is nothing compared to 4 more yrs of Trump and then some potential *actual* progressive.

COMPLETEANARCHY,foi3j2k,t1_fohxo5z,1587777984.0,"Wrong. There are multiple different variations of consequentialist philosophy. Those who argue it to be a moral imperative for you to vote the lesser of evils are simply arguing a specific form of consequentialism. I hate it when people act as if 'vote blue no matter who' holds a monopoly on consequentialist philosophy when it doesn't.

I'm a negative utilitarian, which means I believe that minimizing suffering is more important than maximizing happiness and pleasure. I also believe that so long as you are not actively engaging in behavior that hurts other people, you are under no obligation to do anything to help people. I reject any form of consequentialism that considers it a moral imperative for someone to act solely for the benefit of others. This isn't to say that I discourage altruism, I encourage it actually. I'm simply opposing the coercive authority of forcing people to act altruistically if they don't desire to.

As an anarchist, I oppose all forms of coercive authority. The neutral position between good and evil is simply not acting. You don't hurt people, and you don't help people. Neutral. As a negative utilitarian, so long as you don't hurt people, I won't force you to help people. This is why I don't consider you evil for not dedicating all of your time, money, and resources to maximizing the wellbeing of others. You're a good person to do that, better than most people actually. But it's okay to do things for yourself. You aren't evil for not doing good. I find any argument that you *must* act altruistically 'lest you be evil' to always arbitrarily end at some point. I find no rational justification for you to say someone must act altruistically in some instances but not all.

Therefore based on that, not voting is considered by me to be a perfectly neutral act. It isn't good, it isn't bad, it's neutral. You aren't a bad person for not voting, any more than you are a bad person for not giving to charity. Moral values are solely placed on people's actions. Inaction is morally neutral. The only exception being the neglect of responsibilities that you've willingly accepted and others depend on you for, such as parenting or various kinds of dangerous jobs, etc.

My point being, if you try to shame others as bad people who don't care about the lives and well being of those who are harmed by you not voting the lesser of evils, you're no different than those who'd argue the same of you for not dedicating all your time, money, and resources to the poor. Not voting the lesser of two evils isn't an immoral act. Voter shaming is pointless and wrong.

>Which games in partiular have an aethetic/art style that you enjoyed?

My favorite character designs / art style have to be those by Tetsuya Nomura, be it Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts. It's just that I'm kinda ""meh"" about it now since modern Final Fantasy has moved more towards realism so his designs are kinda irrelevant, and Kingdom Hearts while fun to play is a narrative mess.

My favorite aesthetics / art styles have to be those from: SMT / Persona, Dragon Quest, Xenogears, etc. Those are just the ones that come to mind, lol."
JRPG,fo8rjob,t1_fo8pq0z,1587602365.0,"Akira Toriyama's art style is very unique and eye catching. Can't say it's my favorite, but I do like it quite a bit. Though I agree with you on the Tales series. I love those games, but the buggy eyes and flatter faces have always been sorta ""meh"" to me."
JRPG,fo8rb37,t1_fo8nelz,1587602227.0,"Yeah, that's definately true.

The problem with realism and games is that better technology will always leave previous realistic looking games in the dust. An anime or cartoony art style is what it is regardless of tech."
JRPG,fo8r4zi,t1_fo8n8gq,1587602132.0,True. Even their more realistic art styles can be more unique looking.

Tell that to anyone who doesn't like anime, lol. But yeah, I get what you mean."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,fo4y9sa,t1_fo4xjis,1587513594.0,"I won't deny that darker tones and higher levels of shading leans more towards realism than otherwise, and I acknowledge the fact that this is all just a matter of personal preference and taste.

I just reject the bullshit narrative that the new models are some drastically different design that ruins the game cuz it's ""too anime"" when the difference is *actually* just the new models being higher res with some bright color filters."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,fo4xbgs,t1_fo4wubu,1587513054.0,">Shulk's nose, mouth, and jawline are different, as an example

Low poly count vs high poly count. That's it. Otherwise, it's the same model.

>Also it's not just the colour pallet but the removal of shading to achieve a more solid appearance rather than a more textured one.

I agree, but that's just one form of anime to another. There are plenty of anime and anime style JRPG's that have darker tones and higher degrees of shading. That isn't ""more"" or ""less"" anime."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,fo4wyih,t1_fo37r44,1587512852.0,"I don't mind you having different preferences. If you prefer the ore washed out color pallet that's fine. 

It's just annoyingly stupid to argue that the new designs are ""too anime"" or praise the old designs as ""realistic"" when both designs have the same exact amount of ""anime"" to them.

I feel like I could literally just tweak the color filters on an anime episode and you'd argue that it suddenly looks realistic now."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,fo4wdsy,t1_fo4ucny,1587512522.0,"I have looked at comparison photos multiple times. They're literally the same. The only minor differences are that the new concept art has a brighter color pallet, with the old art maybe having a bit more shading, but that's it.

You're either intentionally exaggerating the differences for whatever reason, or you're just seeing shit that isn't there like some Rorschach inkblot test."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,fo4vtsl,t1_fo32nb6,1587512212.0,"I looked at both, and I'm telling you, they're the exact same. The only difference is that the new models have a brighter color pallet, and have maybe *ever so slightly* less shading. But that's it.

I feel like everyone who keeps seeing this profound difference when there isn't any are the same people who'd instantly see the virgin Mary on a piece of burnt toast."
Xenoblade_Chronicles,fo4vcyo,t1_fo2zu8g,1587511954.0,"The only differences in shape would be due to the original's low poly count. Otherwise, they're the same. I'm not exaggerating when I say they're literally the exact same, just that the new models are higher res and have a brighter color pallet. Yet people act like there's this profound difference when there just isn't."

Seizing power is authoritarian, whereas dismantling power is anti-authoritarian.

I agree with Marxists on many things, but they don't get a free pass for their authoritarianism by it being ""transitional."""
