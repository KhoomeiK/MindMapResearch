pregnant,fp6son4,t3_gb5e97,1588357923.0,"thank you ladies for your replies. 

yesterday i exercised for the second time since i’ve been pregnant. i did mostly body weight workouts and used 8 pound dumbbells for step ups and bicep curls. i’m more nervous about doing too much because i had a miscarriage scare a few weeks back which contributed to me being sedentary (it was BV - caused me to bleed but i took antibiotics for that and am fine now). but i think that was a good light/moderate exercise. 

today i’ve been more conscientious about eating healthier and avoiding junk foods. ate fruit and yogurt for breakfast and snacked on carrots and homemade ranch. 

i feel better. i think i just needed to realize that it’s time for me to look at my pregnancy as a marathon not a sprint. now is a good time to get into a good routine and eating habits now that i’m healthy and in my second trimester without weird food aversions and such. 

thank you again for all of your inputs!"

i feel a lot better today than i have the past few days. classic depression and fatigue. hard to say however because i’m also pregnant. 

i will say i feel like my sleep has improved. my sleep was shit on lexapro. so i hope this continues."

confession,fn4179y,t1_fn3yuhi,1586631975.0,"wow thank you. he’s a even bigger coward pos than i originally presumed from reading the comments. 

OP you’re a rapist and a coward. no one feels bad for your feeling guilty and claiming you’re gonna commit suicide IF you end up facing prison time. 

i have a feeling even if she brushed it off and considered it okay at the time, it may have come back to haunt her later anyway. i’ve had a similar experience where i was confused at the time whether it was rape or not because i was interested in that person. but looking back it was rape as clear as day and i now think of that man as a disgusting rapist. men who take advantage of women while they’re asleep and unconscious are predators.  

like another commenter has said, if you’re ever looking to ask for forgiveness and even begin to think about moving on from your heinous past, you’re gonna have to learn how to accept what it is you did wrong and face the consequences of your actions. you don’t seem like you’ve changed a bit."

my biggest concern is experiencing the same side effects as i did with lexapro. that was a big motivation behind switching for me. 

probably a bit premature to ask since you’re only on day 10 but i’m wondering what side effects i’ll end up with permanently. most side effects of lexapro went for me besides shitty sleep anxiety dreams and night sweats.."

EatCheapAndHealthy,fn2c6im,t3_fytcsn,1586584048.0,"hmm let me have a go at this. i usually go through phases. but i what i currently am into are the following: 

snack veggies i will with hummus or ranch :

carrots, celery, cucumber, baby tomatoes (have you ever tried the kumato ones?! they’re amazing)

fruit: 

organic strawberries only because they really do taste so much better, ambrosia apples, cosmic crisp apples, organic bananas (again they really do taste so much better and i am a fruit snob), korean pears 

veggies to cook with: 

serrano peppers, water chestnut, zucchini, baby cauliflowers, asparagus, cabbage, onion, garlic, mustard greens, collard greens, cilantro, lime

meat: whatever i’m in the mood for

and to be completely honest i also buy some more junk food type snacks like chicken chips or coconut chips and etc. 

i tend to be lenient with snacks because i general eat pretty healthy. i hope some of my items give you an idea for what you get on your next trip to the grocery store!

ooh and i forgot to mention i love eating my apples sliced with plain whole milk yogurt (healthiest kind you can find with not a lot of sugar) and on that most i love making banana shakes with oat milk and misutgaru which is a ground powder of roasted grains and seeds so like a protein powder but organic. 

sometimes i buy rotisserie chicken and take it apart at home to use for chicken noodle soup or salad as well."

He denied help for all of those 10 months until our marriage was in shambles and I was repeatedly kicking him out of the house and his alcohol and drug abuse just spiraled more and more. He's been in detox and now in treatment since 8 days ago. I have been relieved of worries that he might be dead, the mental/verbal/emotional abuse, and constant negativity. I miss him a lot. I feel empty and sad. But like you, I've learned to reach out to my loved ones and come clean about the whole situation (easier now that he's taken action steps to recovery).
