DissidiaFFOO,fosakg4,t1_fosa4qj,1588026983.0,That's perfectly reasonable and I completely agree. I just felt the need to point it out. Perhaps my empathy for the suicidal is a little increased given the times and my life. I hope you enjoyed the stream and are as excited about May as I am!

BPD,fg1etwx,t1_fg0d2t7,1580425835.0,"I'm very sorry to hear about the trauma you experienced in the past. It's a scarily common occurrence with people with BPD and I'm sure mental illness in general. Almost every person who I've gotten to know from this subreddit has had some disturbed things happen to them. 

How long have you felt numb for? Iirc, you were pretty emotional at the store a while ago. The numbness can be either a BPD thing or occur along side it, and it can last a while. 

I hope you get that emotion back and snap out of this state - I know how soul crushing it can feel when you don't... feel. Good luck :)"

I can't speak for you, but I've accepted that my perception can be clouded with relationship issues due to how strong my emotions can be.

It doesn't fix the root problem but it can give you a lot of validation and the strength to move past it."

Remember that while comments take some effort to make, the up and down votes are a simple tap or click. I try not to care how many I get as they don't mean a lot to me and it's too dependent on how many people see the post and not necessarily the contents within.

BPD,ff8mh88,t3_es5kxx,1579685858.0,"This can be a difficult decision. You'll want to have a great deal of trust in this person before you tell them they're becoming your FP, and I'd personally avoid it. If they reject it you may lose them as a friend, but even if they're fine with it it could lead to bonding in a way that makes you even more attached. 

Bottling it up could turn those feelings into resentment and other nasty things, so I really do not recommend that.

I think the simplest way would be to try to spend less time together and focus on other hobbies and people. Hopefully you can naturally settle down your feelings. 

You'll be okay and you'll get through this. Just take it slow and play it by ear, and remember that even if they become your FP, these negative emotions and feelings you're trying to avoid are something you can fight.

Good luck!"

A bit of an exaggeration but not that far off. My only tip is to pay close attention to what triggers the change in your emotional state. Sometimes it's seemingly random and sometimes there's a pattern."
BPD,fernx82,t1_fermdz7,1579356296.0,"Well I'm glad I could provide a little support. :) If this is what's best and something you have to do, it has to be done and remember that it's a burden that's been placed on both of you, not a burden you're placing on him.

BPD,ferm31e,t1_ferjz9c,1579355684.0,"That makes things a bit easier, but the codependency is mainly why I suggest concentrating on him as you do this. Personally, I know I'd come running back if I hurt someone while trying to distance myself, and while that could be different for you, it would make things much more difficult. Of course you need to make sure things are working for you as well. Lastly, if he ends up being hurt don't be too hard on yourself. All you can do is your best.

Good luck!"
BPD,ferjlze,t1_ferfih2,1579354727.0,"If he also has BPD I would especially mentally prepare yourself for some hardships because that can be quite difficult. I believe the best thing to do to start is what you implied, slowly backing away. Too big of a step can be overwhelming for both of you. Pay special attention to any changes in his behaviour and concentrate on him if he's pretty important to you, because with this codependent relationship, if he gets too hurt it could be very difficult to deal with emotionally for you.

So basically even if you're doing this for your own wellbeing, focus on him and his reactions for now (to a reasonable extent), try your best to remain calm if any confrontations emerge, and reassure him that you are and will continue to be his friend."

It can take a while for the feelings to fade. 6 months in my ex still invaded my thoughts quite a bit, but as of now she's just another person. I would say I also felt like my emotions about her would yo-yo pretty similarly. If you feel your ex is fairly toxic I recommend staying strong and trying to forget about him."
BPD,fdq5472,t1_fdq1djl,1578655256.0,"That sounds like a somewhat toxic situation, and I wouldn't consider it simple criticism when they ganged up on you like that. I'd feel angry too.

I feel like dealing with criticism healthily is a learned skill, it's natural to be defensive when someone challenges a part of who you are. Try to see constructive criticism as a person trying to help you and not attacking you. It's hard to be told you're doing something wrong, but think about how the person telling you cares enough about you to deal with potential nastiness in order to see you better your life in some way.

Misguided criticism or insults are a different story. Try to let it roll off you and remember that these people are often using surface level information to create their opinions and throwing it at you. Their thoughts usually have absolutely no influence on your life. 

It's a tough thing, but I hope you can improve and feel better about the whole situation.

All the best!"

I think you're certainly lovable, but it does sound like a good idea to stick with the single life for now. Those were some deep wounds and you need to focus on your well being first and foremost. If it was just anxiety for dating I might suggest trying for it, but I believe you feeling ill simply thinking about relationships may mean that that wound is still very much open.

You have a chance of being hurt no matter what you do. If you can manage it, try not to be too aloof and be true to your emotions.

I don't have much advice for doping with rejection or abandonment. It's very difficult, but it's also something that I've learnt how to deal with mainly experience. There is some muh better advice out there, however.

Try to remember that feeling of satisfaction of having it done and compare it to the dread, fear and regret that will plague you for countless hours. Force yourself to do it. It's what I have to do, and it every single time it has been relieving and more than worth it.

If you enjoy nothing anymore because you're stuck in a loop of your entire life in your mind, something like cannabis (if legal and used responsibly) can help you to actually take things one hour or one minute at a time. You could also try to meditate but it can take a lot of practice.

BPD,fddyb61,t3_ekjal6,1578326926.0,I've had periods where life is looking up for several months and something comes along and breaks me and all of my progress. Hopefully the next time I'm doing well I can better keep my defenses up because I fully expect it to happen again (and again).
BPD,fddxlna,t3_ekiivy,1578326438.0,"When you feel an argument escalating try to disengage if possible and go cool off. This is obviously much more difficult when in person rather than via text, but it's at least something. At least for me, there comes a time where the logical argument loses and you're almost locked in to being an emotional mess, so anything you can do before that point can potentially stop something unnecessary and hurtful."
BPD,fd9lkxk,t3_ek8u6p,1578234987.0,"When your partner isn't your FP I think you need to look for different things in the two. Any comparison will be unfair to your partner, so separating them as filling two different needs can help maintain the relationships. Easier said than done, of course."
BPD,fd9i5wa,t1_fd9g0o7,1578233629.0,"I can't remember what it's like to be without depression so I'm not the exact same, but having your mind stand still is a good way to put it. 

The good thing about a cocoon is when you hatch you're more beautiful than ever before. That's totally believable, right? Ha. I feel like if I hatch some horrible abomination will come out, but I really don't know.

All I can say is if you're trapped in your house and your bedroom, do what you can to learn more about yourself. Self reflect, look up information, or even dissociate and analyze yourself like a different person."
BPD,fd9grql,t3_ek5cwd,1578233061.0,"That sounds very tough but you're at the point of  change where you can start to really learn about yourself and heal. It will be hard but I believe in you.

If you want someone to talk to who understands what it's like to hurt someone without knowing, or anything really, I'll be here."
BPD,fd9fo9r,t3_ek58qr,1578232675.0,"When I really get into someone I feel empty when I'm not with them, so I can relate there. My advice is pretty bad - force yourself to do the things you normally like, even if you don't want to. Sometimes you'll find yourself enjoying it a little bit."
BPD,fd9f255,t1_fd9dptw,1578232531.0,"I don't really see the point most of the time either. My little fragments of hope just manage to push me out of bed and keep my eyes looking forward. I'm not sure what will happen when those are gone.

You may not meet anyone in person from your room but I'm usually available if you want to chat about anything."
BPD,fd9dclt,t3_ek3ya6,1578231846.0,"I hope you can find the joy, desire and love you deserve."
BPD,fd8ypf5,t3_ek2qf5,1578225489.0,"This hits me pretty close. I hope you feel better and if you'd like someone to chat with, feel free to message me."
BPD,fd8x0zx,t3_ejz7oz,1578224706.0,Great job! Sometimes it's surprising how much one little change can effect your life.
BPD,fd4j2dc,t3_ejzc1p,1578167918.0,"I definitely get a kind of attachment to most movies I watch. Even if I didn't particularly love it I'll be quite discouraged when it's over and done with. I get too engaged in it being a world and having that world's story end makes it feel like a small part of me ended too. It doesn't make a lot of sense, and sometimes I'll even not finish movies or video games I like on purpose as to not finish that story. I'm weird."
BPD,fd4esh5,t3_ejs6gk,1578166880.0,I think you were probably her favourite person but she just felt so intensely that it made her act in ways she wasn't comfortable with (justifiably so). I don't think its about you personally but how she feels when she thinks of you. I believe she's trying to protect you and/or herself.
BPD,fd4bzwc,t3_ejrz94,1578166252.0,"I want to say that they can't just lock you in a mental hospital, but I don't know where you live. Check your country/state/province to see what exactly these medical professionals have the authority to do.

As long as you don't have specific plans of harming others, they shouldn't be able to make you do anything you don't want to."
BPD,fd4ath7,t3_ejru5s,1578165887.0,"I'm not sure if it's specifically BPD related, but this certainly happens to me when I'm fairly depressed."
BPD,fd2octj,t3_ejob6c,1578150073.0,I read your journey. I feel sorrow for your struggles but have optimism for your future recovery. Stay strong.
BPD,fd2nfw9,t3_ejnzv7,1578149720.0,"Please stay strong, Melissa. It's going to be hard but you may be surprised at just how much you can improve.

I'm here if you want someone to talk to. I try to understand those who feel like they're never understood."
BPD,fd2me48,t3_ejnyr5,1578149287.0,"The flip flopping is incredibly annoying, but I guess I appreciate having good feelings every once in a while lol.

Off topic, but thumbs up for Paper Mario. Are you talking about the original game?"
BPD,fd2lzyg,t3_ejnjyv,1578149127.0,"That's basically splitting, yes.

And it depends on what the trigger is that causes you to split. If it's in response to what the person does, it could be either or a combination, but if you do it on your own just going through your thoughts, it's much more likely to be splitting. 

If your opinion on whatever it is being manipulation stays consistent, then it could just be discovery. It's common when you split to come back from the change in emotions and feel bad about it."
BPD,fd2ia7i,t3_ejmlv1,1578147636.0,"Trust those who you trust, and don't just pick out what you want to hear. Listen to the good and bad. 

I can rarely see good in myself, so I have to trust loved ones that they're being truthful when they say compliments and the like. Similarly, I trust them that they'll tell me the truth about my issues.

If you get emotional, take it all in as simple information and come back to it later."
BPD,fd2hhwj,t1_fd2gsyw,1578147302.0,"It's absolutely not your fault at all, and it pains me  that people could feel that way at all. It's not on you to be 100% clear that you're not okay with it, it's on them to be 100% clear that you ARE okay with it. Good luck with your mom."
BPD,fd2gef3,t3_ejl5pt,1578146840.0,"Some people are simply unbelievable. I'm so sorry that not only you had to experience all of this, but some ignorant moron making you feel worse for no god damn reason.

I really hope you can recover and everything works out. I wish you the best."
BPD,fd2fsqa,t3_ejl3ue,1578146591.0,"It's good to appreciate that part of yourself. My compassion is about the only thing I can hold on to sometimes, if anything at all."
BPD,fd2etj7,t3_ejkwtk,1578146198.0,"There are definitely times when my friend seems like she's dissociating frequently in the particular day, but I rarely seem to for some reason. The times I have dissociated I wasn't really aware of the time though, it felt like it just stopped."
BPD,fd2cvqe,t3_ejkvsh,1578145392.0,"I'm glad to see that you guys stuck together through everything. It's going to be difficult and you may fall back to your old patterns a lot, but I believe in you."
BPD,fd20c39,t3_ejsseq,1578139670.0,"That is a lot of shit to have piled on you at the same time, I think any person would struggle. His lack of compassion about when you got hurt is honestly kind of gross. Things may seem hopeless at the moment but when everything culminates in one disaster hope gets flown out the window. If you can I would suggest taking some ""me time"" and relaxing your body and mind. It's a lot to take in at once.

I wish you all the best, and if you need someone to talk to, I'm here."
BPD,fd1z4d1,t3_ejsve9,1578139077.0,"That is such a difficult situation with her being your best friend. I don't have much advice but I hope you find a way to get past this.

 I'm always open if you want to talk about this kind of stuff as well, I've had my share of it."
BPD,fd1xbbu,t3_ejt4p9,1578138278.0,"I don't have any suggestions but my god do I ever. Half my life is going through random scenarios in my head, often for events that already happened."
BPD,fczom6b,t1_fcz1f3d,1578105780.0,I'm glad you've come to see him more clearly because he sounds toxic to me. I hope you find someone good for your next relationship.
