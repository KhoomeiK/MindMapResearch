childfree,f651v6f,t3_dlvme4,1572698227.0,"I had fibroids and on 20th of September I had a hysterectomy (everything removed except my ovaries). I made the decision at 35 due to no longer wanting children and having multiple health issues.  One of the fibroids in my uterus was the size of an egg.  I tried birth control but had bad side effects.  In the long run, the health system would save money by letting you get the hysterectomy in the form of medications and further surgeries.  Plus it gets rid of the fibroids permanently in one surgery so you would not have to go under a general anaesthetic as much.  Be persistent with your doctor.  He asked me to make sure I really didn’t want children before booking me in for surgery.  He even gave me a few months to really think about it first"
childfree,f4z6jwv,t3_dm9d4v,1571896923.0,It’s wonderful to hear that you found a doctor that allowed you to have your tubes removed.  I decided not to have children due to my mental and physical health issues and last month I had a full hysterectomy with tube removal. I now have peace of mind of not needing to worry about pregnancy.

Explain to the doctor how your periods impact on your overall wellbeing and your daily life.  Hopefully they will see how it impacts you and they will allow you to go ahead with the surgery.

My GP wasn’t sure at first about me having it done but he eventually decided it would be beneficial for me to have the surgery.
