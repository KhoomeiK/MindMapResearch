I'm moving house this weekend and the stress is driving me mad even though I know I'm super organised and can handle it, yet the lock downs, shortages, whatever else, doesn't really ohade me and I wake up excited, horrible as that sounds, to hear developments."
EMDR,fc873su,t3_egfvip,1577528347.0,"I too am dissociated from my memories - I can remember some violent events with no emotion at all, but little sensory things trigger emotional flashbacks, and on top of that, having cPTSD means that there weren't just ""events"" but the life I lived.

So, when I chose my first memory it was a commonly mentioned one by me which I don't think of emotionally but chose cos I'd mentioned it. With each iteration in the session, I DID connect with the emotion, even crying which I rarely do, moving to anger and disgust and then finally calm disdain.

In my normal life, I noticed then that my ex who was a narcissist had previously been someone I found it hard to be angry at despite his awful behaviour, yet I began to be able to feel these emotions towards him (even though the memory was a childhood one with my dad and brother).

So, the connection isn't always obvious, but initially I think it's about reconnecting the emotion in the memory - not actively, for me it just happened with no prompt - and then reliving it over and over to allow yourself the full suite of emotions that went with it (at least in practice that's what my brain did).

In some iterations of memories, I unexpectedly became incredibly violent towards my abusers (I'm very not violent), which was interesting - this was me just gently reliving the memory and my brain doing what it wanted, how it wanted.

I've been more able to let go of some of my past because I didn't feel I needed to honour people who abused me, and in some ways it has freed me to be able to feel these things that I was never allowed to feel.

I've only done three full memories in three sessions, so I'm new to it, but I've been making a lot of progress with no negative side effects or emotions."

Secondly, I recognise that all the stuff of him and her and my gym that seems so big is small - so I imagine them in a bubble in the gym and then zoom out to see how tiny that bubble really is.

Both things have helped because like you said, it's reprogramming those neural pathways where we saw the bad person as good or good for us. By having an automatic mental response ready, I just replace it so I can rewire my brain to see him realisticag."

Ideally, she can learn to focus on herself and our family, and understand why people being like he is isn't okay.

He plays dad because he has no kids and probably never will, and it was a big reason he wanted to be with me I think. He loves their adoration and idolatry.

I had a talk with my six year old (the one who misses him) about narciasism today. I actually just described the addiction to admiration they have at the expense of caring about others, and my daughter said, ""like name?"" I am working through it so that she chooses not to see him herself , and that is what her psychologist suggested. Ideally she will not want to see him much, which she hasn't (three times in three months) and he's not going out of his way except  when it suits him.

I know you will disagree, but I am doing the best I can for her long term. She is strongly anchored with me, and always has been, and that helps a lot.

Even when I spoke, my voice shrunk she noticed, and it was more like a child asking permission for a treat or something. I'm 32 and only just realising it's okay to set boundaries, to draw lines, to be firm.

CPTSD,f6f341y,t3_dr53x2,1572810211.0,"I don't think you're weird. From all I've read about cPTSD, we so often have lacked that comforting figure and will do almost anything for it - which is why many people like me end up in unhealthy relationships, simply because our desire for love and affection that we didn't get from our parents is so crushing.

I don't think your idea is weird but I'm also not convinced that a stranger would be able to give you the sort of hug you need - that it would end up feeling ingenuine and not the warmth from within you need.

I recognise that doesn't solve your problem and I don't have an answer. I have a friend who I can ask for hugs although he's often busy, but that's the closest I get to that safety. Part of my journey has been enduring those racking sobs alone, feeling that utter abandonment and loss, and then getting up and continuing. It's hard, it hurts and it's not necessary so if you can find an alternative then all the better.

I also know some hippy festivals have free hug kind of things - maybe Craigslist is the way to go for that, if you can have free hugs, or make friendships through tinder where you could get that?"
BPD,f68emjl,t3_dqpn65,1572727972.0,"My first response is, I have all these diagnoses (although mine is complex PTSD, not from war trauma).

In terms of what to do, the first step is seeing a clinical psychologist who can talk to you, and start to unravel this. In the end the labels matter less when you're getting the right sort of treatment to support you.

I would recommend the book ""the body keeps the score"" as this deals with PTSD and has some great options for working on healing, and may give you some direction as to which path you want to take for healing. You may also find people you relate to, which in itself can be therapeutic.

None of us can tell you what the best step for you is - a good psychologist will be able to help you, and personally in my experience psychiatrists are only good for medication to bandage the wound, not help it heal. Counsellors are often under qualified. I would seek someone with explicit experience with PTSD given you've had unique traumatising experiences that many people wouldn't have had, and you'll likely do better with someone who has training or knowledge around that."
CPTSD,f62mrov,t3_dqc8b0,1572662918.0,"I believe, in addition to the dissociation mentioned, that for us, that wall is a life of experiences which make us feel fundamentally different to those we interact with. We don't share the same fundamental life experiences, comforts, or supports. The underlying safety net they have is something we don't.

It's like trying to talk to someone while you're both walking a tightrope, while they have a net to catch them but you don't; they will never quite understand your fear, and half your mind is always on the lack of a net. You feel like they all have nets (however dodgy), yet we don't."

You can not accept the money and choose other options, which comes with a lot of hassle and hard work and I'm not saying it's nice for that to happen, but if they give you the money under those conditions I do kinda think it's their right (even if it's not nice or fair)."

I gave him money, ran his business, tried to be understanding of his weed addiction, worked full time (at my job not his business), did most of the cleaning, did most of the childcare (not his biological children but they called him daddy). And if I asked him to clean more he told me I was never happy, nothing was ever good enough for me, I was so demanding. If I asked him to do things reasonable of a partner, it was my fault for being too emotional, because I had abnormal needs cos of my background.

Then he flirted with a girl in front of me for months, crossed the line with her while we were dating (apparently didn't have sex but he's lied so much I don't know if that's true), lied to me about business stuff and told me it wasn't my business even though he owed me tens of thousands for that same business, and as soon as we broke up slept with her within a month and was dating her. When I begged him to sleep with anyone else, I was suicidal and non-functional and self harmed for the first time in seven years, he walked away and kept doing it, because how I felt was my problem and he was single and could do what he liked. He knew my history of abuse, abandonment, trauma, the fact two of my parents died and my dad is old and senile almost and my brother is a drug dealer, and yet he literally walked away while I was curled on the floor crying hysterically (I've never cried that much since I was a child and he'd only seen me cry once of twice ever).

For me, I have to have a construct in my head to make things feel tolerable - so I take a situation I'm in, and construct almost a movie scene or narrative where I'm the protagonist faced with all this shit, but I'm strong and fight on even when hope is gone and so forth.

At the moment I'm struggling hard, and that means trying anything and everything.

I set up a whatsapp group for friends of mine who don't know each other but could help get me through a suicidal period after the breakup and cheating and new girl. That way I'm not burdening any one of them but can talk when I feel shit and get support.

I have phrases to help me that I repeat like mantras, put on post it's, and so on. ""focus on me"", ""this is just a feeling, it can't hurt you"" ""this will end"" ""the only way out of hell is through it"" etc.

I've also read a book called adult children of emotionally immature parents, and have started reading the body keeps the score, both of which are furthering my understanding of the depth of my trauma and its effects. I've been working for a decade on myself, but only now I'm realising until I deal with that underlying stuff in the past, I can't just ignore it or pretend it isn't there.

I try to write lists of what I want to focus on in life to get me through - what's important and I want to spend my life energy on. It's hard cos I feel so shit and miserable, but I get slivers of hope and I cling to them."
CPTSD,f3arp6c,t1_f3arbvi,1570788319.0,"Are you in therapy? It sounds so awful to be living like that. I'm reading a book right now called the body keeps the score about ptsd, including cPTSD (not by name but they talk about childhood trauma) and ways beyond standard talking therapy to overcome those responses, including EMDR which I don't know about but a lot of people post on here and have been able to reduce nightmares, panic attacks and heal some trauma etc.

Has something recent triggered this, or is it an ongoing feeling?"
CPTSD,f3armky,t1_f3alnc0,1570788211.0,"I remember I saw titanic when I was 12 and even then the quote ""I feel like I'm standing on the edge of a precipice, with nobodg to hold me back - nobody who cares or even notices""  (not verbatim) stuck with me.

It hurts so much to feel so alone. I'm learning - and trying to draw strength from - realising that I am the one who has to do this. Because I can't change being alone. And when I focus on it, it tears me up inside. But when I try to shift the narrative to like being in a movie about clawing my way up despite the pain and all odds, it helps shift my emotions a little so I can keep fighting.

I'm so sorry. Do you want to talk about your feelings or experiences or situation here?"
CPTSD,f3aritp,t1_f3abe2a,1570788059.0,"Thank you, hugs are definitely welcome.

That sounds so hard. I feel like the worst thing about flashbacks is a feeling like life will never change, even when you know rationally it will, but it takes you back to being completely and utterly helpless.

You have four year old twins? That must be adorable and exhausting. And I'm sorry to hear about your spouse - is it an unhealthy relationship?

That's kind of why I wanted to start this - sometimes it feels less painful and crushing when you know you're not alone and there are others who feel the same even if their experiences are different."

CPTSD,f3a683x,t3_dg8jxk,1570762751.0,Yes but I also have borderline personality disorder which also comes out of cPTSD for some.
raisedbynarcissists,f3a6571,t3_dg8nxp,1570762691.0,I feel this too. My mum is now dead anyway but even when she wasn't I didn't have it. It hurts so much.
BPD,f39pilw,t1_f2xajju,1570753167.0,"This does sound like it goes beyond a therapeutic relationship, but at the same time it's clear you've got a deep attachment and in itself that's gonna be central to you, which as a borderline we all relate to. When you have that person, no reason matters cos of how you feel about them. And we all understand that.

Honestly at this point, I believe that for you, you won't be able to not continue this, and he is crossing a line but willingly, and we can't change that and nor can you unless you speak up (which you can't cos of how you feel, understandably, because he's your attachment figure).

I don't know your history so he may have a reason for doing this. Mainly I would say, if you can try to apply what you're learning to your life and get benefit from therapy outside of your relationship with him, then that's a positive and a great thing to get from this."
raisedbynarcissists,f2wtu08,t3_dejgot,1570470132.0,"It wasn't your job to protect your siblings. That was your parents. And they fucked up, but that never meant it was your job.

You were a kid. A kid who should never, ever have had to experiencsle or feel that. Who shouldn't have had to feel in charge of his siblings because his parents were physically healthy and able but emotionally unfit to parent.

I'm sorry. Rage away. Sometimes I think I need to get more angry, because I suppressed it so long - like you, I learnt that anger just got the belt (or wooden/metal spoon) so I learnt not to be angry. Or I thought I did. I self harmed for a long time and only took my anger out on myself, the last person to deserve it.

You're here. You're fighting. You're working on it. And that means everything, it does. Cos without that, I dknow.

Sorry I have a cold and my head hurts so this doesn't make sense. But yeah, you're amazing to have survived and be writing this."
BPD,f2wswz8,t1_f2weytg,1570469807.0,"I would second this. I have a therapist who is amazing and knows me well and I've been seeing for a few years, but at that point we text to arrange a session if I'm in need of an urgent one, or she will send a message maaaaybe once a month at most with a link to something relevant to what we've talked about (but no conversation).

I would think this isn't healthy or professional; getting to know each other well becomes a problem with BPD precisely for the reason you say - we're prone to getting intense and blinded by our own feelings when we care, and our reality begins to distort. For your therapist to help you, you really need to have a working relationship rather than a personal one.

Would it be possible to find a new therapist get continue the friendship? Obviously I don't know the situation and it may be far more nuanced, but it does seem to be crossing the professional boundary which more importantly isn't helpful for your development (because of the aforementioned BPD trait we have of getting messed up emotionally when we get close to people, which restricts your ability to take on board professional insight from your therapist)."
bipolar,f2vypig,t3_deiz5q,1570459108.0,"Can you see a clinical psychologist and then get meds from a GP. I'm in Australia and this works, I've never met a psychiatrist I like, they don't seem to have humanity or empathy (not that bad, but, yeah)."

raisedbynarcissists,f2vw9op,t1_f2urz24,1570458215.0,"That's awesome you have. Look, I moved out at 16, never did NC, my nMum died when I was 28, and even now at 32 I'm still learning to recognise what happened in my life for what it was. It's really hard to see your parents as wrong even when you know they are - my core self worth is still based on  how she treated me, and I'm slowly relearning to value myself.

I'm so glad you're moving forward to a better life without them. It's hard because it seems parents are essential parts of life, but ... no parent is better than an nParent."
bipolar,f2vvu52,t1_f2r0vgx,1570458055.0,"I guess I disagree. Mania and depression are mood disorders characterised by a prolonged altered state of emotion - they are not moods in and of themselves (hence people who say they are so depressed or feeling manic are in accurate when they mean how they feel in the moment). Sad is a mood; being sad for three months without respite signifies depression, but your mood is still sad - your clinical state and diagnosis is depression/depressed."
bipolar,f2vuyub,t1_f2lyk8n,1570457726.0,"Um, what makes you think I self diagnosed? I've been diagnosed and treated by a psych ward, twice, psychiatrists and clinical psychologists. I've attempted suicide multiple times and had huge life percussions due to my illness.

In clinical speak it is a mood disorder because it affects your mood, but mood in common parlance is different to an episode of depression or mania. Depression is not a mood - it is a prolonged period of low mood with other conditions. Do you see the difference? It's not a mood even though it is characterised by the way your mood is.

Additionally, like the weather is daily but climate is long term, I see bipolar like that. Moods are something people can work on - but if you have depression or mania, you can't change an ongoing long term chemical imbalance, even if you can shift your mood for a few hours. For those without bipolar, adjusting the mood for a few hours bounces them back to normal."

In my mind they are not your family; they are lowly human beings abusing someone who doesn't have the power to fight back, and you are a vulnerable and resilient person who has dealt with all of this horror.

It's horror. It's not okay. You don't need to cling to the niceness, you need to get out, please. Please tell a school counsellor or even the police; google women's shelters and see what options are available in your area. Print this out and hand it to them if you can't talk, please, please, please.

You do NOT deserve this. You are not worthless. You have so much worth, and only people who themselves are worthless would want this.

The record from CPS would show of abuse in the past and back up your claims. Alternatively, and this is awful too, if he ever comes back and does it again, go straight to the police afterwards and maybe they can collect evidence although that's a very awful prospect for you and not an easy thing to do.

Please leave, please please please leave. You deserve better. So so so much better. Rape and abuse are not the norm and not okay."

Right now, she isn't your problem. It seems she simply doesn't want to learn - she wants something easily, to be spoon fed, and for someone else to do the work.

I don't know enough about this but maybe NC is an option? Or just tell her frankly that she has the tools, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink, yknow?"

bipolar,f2kqn6k,t1_f2khk1p,1570288480.0,"What? It sounds like you're talking about borderlines (which is usually what people in media mean by bipolar, although I have both).

Not everyone or even most people who have bipolar have outbursts. My manic episodes are happy and self focused; my depressed episodes are suicidal and self focused. I don't push people away in either, but do isolate when depressed. I don't know anyone who does either of those things because they're bipolar.

We can choose our moods; we can't change our brain chemistry. Mania and depression are not moods.

And we can change our actions and modify them including managing our illness to minimise the impact on those around us."

I definitely do the same, especially in romantic relationships where I carry the burden happily for a long while and when I ask for more, suddenly the other person is all like, well that's not how we do it.

Many people would agree with having the union jack removed, but that doesn't change the history of the country, nor does having the current flag mean you support white colonialism, it's simply the only flag we have.

Second of all, can you get a mental health care plan from your GP? I know that won't get you meds but a good psychologist can help give you other support.

Why January? Can you afford even one session with a private psychiatrist to get the right meds? Can a GP prescribe ADHD meds (I thought they could?). Depending on where you live, I would suggest reaching out to NA or something to get some sort of regular support for the addiction stuff.

I'm really tired and about to sleep, but please PM me if you wanna chat. I have a history of AN (not addiction but ice is my drug of choice on the very rare occasion I can), I worked at a brothel when I was about your age in order to save money to buy a car and get my licence, and I've had decades of mental illness shit in some form.

I'm about to go overseas but I'll have my phone and if you need someone to chat feel free to PM me.

The very fact you're trying is great, amazing, and you're moving forward. That makes more difference than you realise, I swear (having dated numerous addicts and seen what happens)."
