But, to think if I was ‘picture perfect’ that things would’ve worked out is kidding myself. 

It will feel great when the emotional connection/attachment is completely gone and what you know in your head/the truth can finally line up with your feelings towards it too. I know who he is and he knows I know, now I just have to wait for time to heal the rest. I try not to think about how it’s really not effecting them in any way.
