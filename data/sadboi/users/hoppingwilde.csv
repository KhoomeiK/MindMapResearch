Also not only is our country like running 50 independent countries when it comes to this, new york alone has more cases then any country. So to say that it's the LockDown that is the issue is like i said before, well used a analogy, ignoring the cause. We are in the lockdown not for fun or bear attack but because of the virus.

The fact that you are putting in bold ""you have been duped so hard"" also says a lot"
