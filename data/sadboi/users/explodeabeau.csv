ftm,fbi24q7,t3_edif0r,1576888620.0,"Hi! I don't know if this is helpful but as a fellow Asian trans dude, I have never been questioned once about wanting a men's haircut if I pulled up a picture of a guy. I have gone to different hair places and had cuts both by men and women as well while presenting as female to not deal with extra hassle, I think that generally people don't care much. (I do live in a super conservative area as well if that's a worry, so I assume they don't deal with this a lot.) That said, I usually ask for something somewhat idol-y and show a pic of that as honestly that is what works for my hair texture and face. If you're really worried about being questioned, I think a similar approach where you use a celebrity pic will probably stave off any real interrogation. People want to look like their favorite celebs all the time.

I have gone through several different variations on the typical two block haircuts, some more harsh than others, and all have worked with my face so far. It's pretty common and stylish even for women to do this (literally living in Taiwan rn for this portion of the year and have seen many, many masculine haircuts, so you can always chalk it up to following a style trend and wanting a change). If you want, feel free to DM and I will link you a few of the reference pics I have used getting my cuts, I'm sure I have at least something on my phone still!

Also, you look great! I don't think your face is chubby, bro. I hope you have a great day."

asktransgender,f9btytb,t3_e4eacv,1575216243.0,"That's absolutely horrible. I'm sorry you're having to deal with this. But, honestly? The fact that it seems like she's hidden this activity from you (correct me if I'm wrong, when you said found that reddit account it seems like she may have made a separate one/kept it secret) strongly implies that a - she knows it would hurt you and did it anyway, and b - she's doing it pretty deliberately. 

It's not exactly hard to intuit that attacking various parts of the LGBT+ community,  *especially* one that your own partner is a part of, would hurt said partner. She does not have respect for trans people, and if she's participating in those types of communities, she possibly doesn't respect your gender identity either. 

Ultimately, it's up to you what you choose to do. But please know that it's misery to stay with someone who fundamentally disagrees and discriminates against a part of you. It isn't all of you, but it's still a part of you, and deserves to be respected and cared for. I have made that mistake, and it was horrible, and toxic, and continued being more and more abusive as my partner attempted to whitewash both my race and my gender. Succumbing to bigotry perpetuates it. It's hard to break free from toxicity, especially when you do care deeply about someone and think the absolute best of them.

But people don't change unless they want to. Please remember you're worth it, and pick what makes you safe and happy."
