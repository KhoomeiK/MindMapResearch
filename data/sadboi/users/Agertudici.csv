There's usually a power dynamic of some kind involved like older/younger or parent/child. By definition that makes it rape because it creates a situation in which one person may feel like they can't say no because the other person is supposed to be in charge of them.

Once you get into situations where one person can't say no to sex you start involving things like trauma and ptsd and permanent emotional damage.

The only way I could see that power dynamic not existing is maybe with twins of the same sex, because we already have this huge problem as a society with men raping women. But that's less because there isn't a problem with it and just because I can't think of one off the top of my head.

Now a lot of times power dynamics really get people going sexually even though they're not healthy in real life.

It basically falls down to barrier and non-barrier methods.

Non barrier methods can be broken down into hormonal and hormonal. The pill, patch, ring, shot, morning after pill, and most implants are hormonal, and they work by preventing the woman from releasing an egg. The only nonhormonal implant that comes to mind is the copper IUD which works by killing sperm and by irritating the uterus enough that it also kills sperm. Other than that the nonhormonal non barrier methods are mostly just various ways of placing spermicide like the foam, cervical sponge, and diaphragms. None of these prevent the spread of disease.

Only barrier methods prevent the spread of disease. These are the male or ""out"" condom and the female or ""in"" condom. They actually prevent people's bodily fluids and mucuos membranes from touching each other's, so they actually prevent the spread of disease. They should not be used at the same time because they actually rub against each other destructively and can cause each other to tear.

Additionally there are two more barrier methods that do not prevent pregnancy but which do prevent the spread of disease during activities that do not usually cause pregnancy anyways. These are dental dams for oral sex and hand condoms, or as the killjoys at my job like to call them, disposable gloves, for fingering and handjobs."

NoStupidQuestions,fqxvjj0,t3_glinde,1589738524.0,"Heroin is an downer/depressant. Stimulates the same receptors in your brain as morphine and endorphins. Removes pain by disrupting your ability to feel it. It also slows everything down so it lowers your heart rate, blood pressure, and your breathing rate. Lowering your breathing rate in particular can be very dangerous. It also slows down other parts of your body like your GI tract, making you constipated, and it usually makes you sleepy.

Cocaine is an upper/simulant. Not sure exactly what receptors it hits but it brings your HR, BP, RR up, the opposite of heroin. The caine family of drugs (eg. lidocaine) can block pain locally by affecting the local pain receptors. I've heard of boxers snorting cocaine to make them less sensitive to punches to the face.

Iirc molly is MDMA. I'm less sure about this one. I believe it is an upper because iirc correctly it can cause tachycardia (heart rate too fast) and malignant hyperthermia (temperature too high).

They're all addictive substances which means they can rewire your brain to seek them over things that are normally important to people like their children, other family and friends, food and water, and basic safety.

People are usually advised to ""not mix their uppers and Downers"" because you would think it would be a good idea to use them to cancel each other out but there is a particular pair that interacts very badly and will kill you very quickly, but I forget exactly what it is.

The stimulants in particular however, can also cause psychosis, or detachment from reality, usually involving hallucinations (seeing and hearing things that aren't real), delusions (thinking things that don't make sense), paranoia (thinking everyone is out to get you), and bizarre behavior (pants on your head, walking cock out down the middle of the interstate in the middle of winter). Psychosis can also make it difficult to think or do anything or interact with people.

Often the psychosis wears off when the drug does but this is not always the case. Many, possibly even most of my clients with significant lifelong psychosis are experiencing it because of drug use, whether it was recent or not. Many of them it was because they used stimulants frequently, but some of them didn't use a whole lot they were just really sensitive to whatever they took. Weed in particular (especially the new breeds that are such stronger than your grandma's generation was breeding them) is very much associated with schizophrenia and worsening psychosis, although there is some evidence it improves anxiety.

Even if they switch to providing renewables, they lose money that they could've been gaining from their existing assets including property that contains fossil fuels, machinery to harvest and process it, and the overall logistics systems they use to process and deliver it.

So even if they bought the equivalent amount of renewable energy equipment every time one of the old machines failed, they would most likely need to put it on different land or change the land they have, and they would no longer get to use the land rich in fossil fuels that they already own/have bought access to. Then they would have to build new systems to deliver it in ways that are appropriate to the type of energy being produced (for instance you don't send electricity through a pipeline) and possibly that connect it to the new location it's being collected from.

I got tired of the palpitations so I cut back a little. Then I was having migraines more and more frequently and when I saw a neurologist about it she said she suspected my caffeine intake was giving me rebound headaches. She was correct, I cut back further with very good effect. I still get a headache if I completely abstain from caffeine, so I am sure to drink a small amount every morning.

I mostly drink green tea now because by the time I have drank the same amount of caffeine I have been much better hydrated than with other caffeinated beverage options. I still occasionally have a cup of decaf which still has about 10mg caffeine per cup (regular is ~ 200 mg) because sometimes I crave the taste. I also try to avoid drinking any caffeine after noon has passed. Lately I have not been behaving myself very well in that respect, but I'm still trying.

As for the amount, that is what I would call a moderate or moderately high amount of caffeine for a regular drinker. This is called tolerance and happens with any habit forming substance. His body has adjusted to that and he will have unpleasant (but not likely dangerous) withdrawal effects if he does not taper off. Basically his body has adjusted his heart rate and blood pressure to the presence of the caffeine, and it will adjust to not having it, but it will have a difficult time doing that and this will make him feel very crappy. The biggest thing that will happen is he will have a very bad headache, probably bad enough to make him nauseous and light and sound sensitive.

Many people who quit caffeine use something called caffeine-wean which is a regimine of scheduled pills that will taper them off the caffeine and ease or eliminate withdrawal. They also might drink decaf, which removes 95% of the caffeine from the tea or coffee, or half-caff in which decaf coffee is mixed with regular coffee to produce a half-strength beverage. They may also brew something called chicory root instead of coffee, which is a completely caffeine free substance that produces a similar tasting beverage, or mix the chicory root with their coffee, similar to a half-caff mix.

If you want to get better at supporting people with addictive behaviors like caffeine and food problems, or even more serious things like smoking and substance abuse, I highly recommend you look into motivational interviewing. It's key to remember that you can never fix people, only help by increasing their motivation and odds of trying and success.

NoStupidQuestions,fqx2v0z,t3_glfm9k,1589724514.0,"This is your body's natural defense mechanism against pressure injuries. Any way you sit stand or lay puts pressure on some part of your body (unless you're an astronaut in 0g I suppose).

The area where the pressure is being applied has reduced blood flow. It's not a big deal if it's for a short period of time, but if you don't keep rotating the area under pressure, that one area will go too long without oxygen or nutrients and start to die.

This usually happens to healthy people when they get new shoes that haven't formed to their feet yet. Those are the blisters you get in the heel and on the toes where the shoe is too tight on that spot. Eventually you wear the material out in that spot or the material stretches in that spot and the pressure is relieved and this stops happening.

But very sick people in the hospital get blisters like that on their butts, heels, shoulder blades, and other places because they are either so sick and tired that it their lack of energy to move overwhelms this reflex, or because a stroke or traumatic injury has paralyzed them, or they have nerve damage that prevents the discomfort you're describing and they forget to move themselves.

It's called a ""pressure injury"", ""bedsore"", or ""pressure ulcer"" and nurses and nursing assistants turn patients the side and then to the other side and other various positions regularly to prevent this. A patient with reduced sensation or mobility has to be moved at least every two hours to prevent this.

P.S. If you're laying in bed so much you've noticed this, you're probably laying in bed much too long and unless your doctor has actually put you on bedrest for some reason, you need to get up and go do something like going for a walk or even just stretching. Staying in bed is putting you at risk for a lot of very bad things like muscle wasting, clots in your legs that dislodge and wind up in your lungs, brain, and heart, the air sacs in your lungs getting stuck closed, constipation, and serious mood disturbances, especially severe depression.

NoStupidQuestions,fqwugjq,t3_gle3y7,1589717972.0,"I would think it would depend on how long the surgery is but they generally avoid feeding you the traditional way (or even with the nose tube) because they're worried about aspiration. Aspiration is when food or fluid that should go into the stomach either goes down the windpipe in the first place or comes back up the esophagous and goes down the windpipe. It can either block the windpipe altogether and restrict breathing (choking), or it can just sit in the lungs and provide a better medium for bacteria to grow (pneumonia).

The big reason this happens during surgery is a) when they sedate you even lightly (that thing where you can still talk to the doctor but don't remember anything) it suppresses the reflexes that send food down the esophagous and keep it out of the windpipe and b) sometimes they sedate you all the way and intubate you (put a tube down your throat to breathe for you) and they have to specifically repress that reflex so that you don't try to cough up the throat tube.

They don't just use the nose-to-stomach tube because that actually makes you MORE likely to get food in your lungs because it holds open the sphincter above your stomach that normally keeps food from going back to the esophagus, especially when you're lying flat like you are during most surgeries.

Because they don't feed you during surgery they sometimes give d5w or dextrose (sugar) in saltwater directly into your veins, but they don't like to give it through a regular IV in your arm because it can really damage the littler veins in your arms and cause tissue necrosis. I know I've seen the nurses give it before surgery, but when I did my OR rotation I didn't see it given during. That said, I literally just saw two 3-5 hour hip replacements (did you know they hammer it into place? I didn't).

Diabetics who take medication like insulin or pills that affect how much insulin they release often have to have it withheld or the dose altered before surgery to accommodate all of this.

Surgery also counts as an injury though, and your body has to heal from that, so you do need a lot of extra calories and vitamins and especially protein afterwards.

To maintain attention I need to occupy my hands, eyes, ears, and language/understanding

If I'm working on something like laundry or the dishes, my hands and eyes are occupied, but I need something for my ears and language. A podcast or a show I don't have to really look at is great.

But if I'm in lecture my ears and language centers are good, but I need to occupy my hands and eyes. I've done all kinds of things. I've crocheted, I've doodled. Sometimes at home I combine the laundry or the dishes with a video or podcast on what I need to know. I even have a wide collection of fidget toys. My favorite is the Rubik's cube designed for blind people. I've even solved it behind my back or under the table and just suffered through not having anything to look at if I'm in a small lab group and I'm worried about distracting my peers.

But you know what's WAY more convenient? 2048. I can listen much longer and better when I'm playing it. It occupies all the right parts of my brain without drawing away anything I need to pay attention. My in class notes suck, but that's why I do those at home (I listen to music without lyrics to keep my ears busy while I read). Atomas is another great pick. So are dots & co, sort it 3D, this really cool game I found where you literally just untangle knots, and even solitaire is great for this.

I need accommodations to help my instructors understand that I really am paying attention. I know my paying attention doesn't look like everybody else's. To make it ""look"" like I'm paying attention costs me my ability to actually pay attention. Sometimes I try anyway to make others more comfortable, or like I said above if I'm worried about taking away from their learning environment. But I shouldn't have to. The most important thing my accommodations do is make it so that they can't force me to be worse at listening just because of the way it looks to them.

So you might be right about your fellow diagnosed peers, or maybe even just some of them. But maybe ask yourself if for some people ""paying attention"" might just look different."
changemyview,fqk2xtk,t3_gisbtz,1589419266.0,"So I've never worked in law enforcement but I have worked in a psychiatric hospital which means I've worked in a position where I have significant power over the people I'm serving and which is another area of work often condemned for corruption and abuse.

Furthermore it was an all-male forensic psychiatric unit. That's men who are being psychiatrically evaluated after showing signs and symptoms of a mental illness while in jail or prison. And many of them require placement away from female patients for a reason.

I have met a lot. of rapists.

I'm also a young girl who's not real big and not real tough. But I worked there for almost two years and did not sustain any significant injuries during that time. There's two big reasons I attribute that to and one of them is respect. You'd be surprised how much violence you can avoid in general by just being decent to other people, even and especially when you have power over them. I think it was MLK that said ""violence is the language of the unheard.""

But while rapport is nice, you never trust it. When someone is in the middle of a psychotic episode and they believe you're actually Lucifer here to impregnate them there is no more talking.

Do cops deal with less psychotic people than I did? Yeah, but they still deal with a fair few, especially people on drugs. And at least I knew with almost certainty that none of my patients had a knife or gun. Cops never have that certainty. Ever.

That's where teamwork comes in.

I did not fit in well on my unit to begin with. Part of it was that I had been a patient at that hospital before but part of it was also that it was my first big real full time job and I still needed to learn time management. I was admittedly kind of a mess but also they didn't really try to teach me and at points actively tried to get rid of me.

But one day I was down a hall alone on suicide watch and I happened to hear something behind me and I looked, and then I started yelling. And when I looked back up the hall I saw them look at me for a split second before they started running to me. And that's when I really understood, because if they hadn't come running I was screwed. And the thing is, for them to run down the hall to save me, they have to know that I will run down the hall to save them too. You cannot function in that position without that trust and you will do or not do a lot of things to keep it intact.

Does calling somebody out really break that trust? Maybe not. But it might, and trust me you're gonna be very, very hesitant to take that risk. And it's not just the person you told on either. Your coworkers can close ranks real fast.

And THAT is due in big part to the fact that administrative failures often make it difficult to do your job correctly. We were sometimes given 1 free technician for the floor and told we needed to go into individual patients rooms alone to get vitals. Do you know what happens if a patient attacks you alone in a room? If you have multiple people you can safely restrain each limb. If it's just me I have to punch as hard as I can and run. I'll get fired but I'll live... hopefully. If your coworker gets caught on that shit and you can say something to save their ass would you? Did they really abuse somebody or did they do what they had to to escape with their life? I never had to make that call but I heard talk (nothing founded of course) of people on other units who did.

You get so used to being used and abused by your supervision that shit like that just adds up. Everyone is doing something not by the book because you haven't been given enough people or enough time or enough supplies to do anything the actual right way. Most of the time it turns out fine but sometimes shit turns South so suddenly from the most innocuous thing that everyone does every day and all you can think is shit that could've been me.

It's just a complete shitshow. I did everything I could to create the safest and most therapeutic environment for my patients but there were honestly things I could've handled better. I'm sure this all seems relatively tame to you but I could feel that slope getting slipperier and slipperier. It's a big part of why I left that facility.

We had a guy that would pick verbal fights with a particular patient and escalate him every night they interacted and he eventually got fired for shenanigans but all I could think about reporting him sooner was that we'd be one more person short and we were already far too short. No one else would even think of reporting him because he was the only male staff on our shift.

The USA in particular has a HUGE problem with police brutality. But do I blame the individual cops for not speaking out?

Honestly I don't know. Yeah that change has to start from within but with the position I worked in I know that it's not something you can put on the shoulders of frontline workers. They're too busy trying to not die.

And honestly I don't even know how to fix it other than that I know it can't be fixed until we're willing to actually hire enough people and let people take enough time off. There were people at my old facility working 80 hour weeks under threat of dismissal. That's 5 16 hour shifts a week. And trust me, hour fourteen is about when a patient calls you a fat bitch and your mouth just says ""so's your mom"" without your permission. It's for this reason that I had disability note that limited me to 5 12 hour shifts a week. Which is still too damn much.

I dunno. This has been a bit of a ramble. I tried to rearrange it a little so it follows better. But I hope it helps. I need to go to bed soon."
changemyview,fqjvz7z,t3_gizks5,1589415999.0,"I'm a Presbyterian and Presbyterians really value education. The Presbyterian Church was a big part of the push for public school in the US. They wanted everybody to be able to read so they could read the Bible. Reading and asking questions and interpreting for yourself is a big part of what I was raised with.

But also I'm a healthcare worker and a nursing student. I usually work 16 hours a week during clinicals and when they bring them back over the summer to get me caught up with all I've missed it's probably gonna kick my ass all over again. I don't have the brain juice or the physical juice right now to study my Bible or go to Bible study groups.

Fortunately my congregation has chosen to hire someone (actually two people but w/e) who has spent their entire career studying the Bible. They've read the entire thing and they know as much as possible about the cultural context of each part. When I do work up the energy and time to go to church (I'll be honest, it's a struggle sometimes) I get to hear about the history of the week's chosen scripture and in what ways society does and does not differ from the context in which it was written, and how that affects the modern life I'm living in my own community. I get to hear an interpretation of that piece of text from an expert.

And if they seem to be doing or preaching some sketchy shit? Well in the Presbyterian Church at least, we fire them. Fortunately we have a very good pastor who has provided quality guidance to our community for many years.

In trying to find you a good example I'm remembering vaguely from a long time ago, but one sermon that comes to mind is the time our adjunct minister talked to us about Jesus' statement about marriage being between one man and one woman. Her (figures I suppose) interpretation of this was that this was a time in which it was common to marry several women, and that Jesus felt it was important that the woman be an equal partner with the man. She didn't comment much on homosexuality other than to say that she didn't feel that was the most important point that was being made in that scripture. Do I 100% agree with her? I admit that I haven't gotten the chance to read over it for myself recently, and I would probably form a better opinion on it if I did. Also there was more to it that I don't remember (I really need to work on my attendance, ok?)

But the point I'm making is that to me that's what a minister is and that's what they do with sermons. A minister is someone you hire as congregation to study the Bible and try to figure out and tell you how all of this still applies to the modern community you're actually living in. I think you're 100% correct that no one should be considered some infallible spokesperson for the almighty because that is very very dangerous.

But there is definitely a place for someone whose job it is to study all of this to tell me what they think of how what they read applies to my current life. Because that is a very complicated topic that deserves many more hours in a week than I have time for."

The cat will be cleaner than the dog, but cats tend to track litter from their litterbox on whatever surfaces they walk on. I would argue this is much worse than some random outside dirt.

That Siamese kitten will not be chill both because it is Siamese and a kitten. Siamese cats are known for being energetic and vocal. If you want a chill cat go to a shelter and get an adult mutt of some kind. Ask the shelter workers for their chillest lap cat and they will hook you up.

Cats get old too. I would argue myself that they stay cute longer than dogs but once they really start to age their eyes and fur get dull and they even begin to bald sometimes.

They are much less work than dogs but you need to do about three things in particular.

The first thing is you need to clean the litterbox regularly. If you don't the cat may start going to the bathroom elsewhere.

You also need to provide active stimulation, you can't just buy them toys. Cats need prey that tries to run from them and hide and that struggles and dies painfully when caught. You can provide this stimulation yourself with a length of string or a feather on a stick, but like I said, it needs to move purposefully, not randomly. If you do not provide this sensation the cat will get bored and destructive. They also need the stimulation of scratching things. You have to provide an acceptable place to scratch or it will find other things.

Finally, you have to provide consistent rules and consequences. If you don't want the cat scratching somewhere or climbing on something you must punish them (usually by spraying them with water) every single time they do it. There is no not feeling like you want to stand up this time. If you are not consistent the animal will be badly behaved."

And then the GP can tell you sometimes if you need to see a specialist like they decided I was having too many headaches to be A GP problem so I went to a neurologist who looked at my brain pictures and confirmed the GPs suspicion that I do indeed just drink too damn much caffeine. But they needed to make sure it wasn't a tumor or aneurysm you know?"
