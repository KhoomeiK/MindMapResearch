TrueCrime,fr3s39i,t3_gm9hsg,1589864740.0,"A person I knew died recently under bizarre and mysterious circumstances. 

An old high school friend of mine was killed a few weeks ago under extremely bizarre circumstances. 33 years old, 2 children, wife (recently separated but it was mutual) and had a house and plenty of land. He worked for the same landscaping company for 14 years and never missed a day of work. Never a drug user and just socially drank. Only contact with law enforcement was a speeding ticket. Never had any mental illness or ever showed signed of mental illness according to his friends and family. 

He randomly flies from his home in western New York to Georgia during the pandemic on May 6th to meet a “ new friend”. They reportedly went for a drink, next thing we know is that 6 hours later he was screaming aggressively, banging on neighbors doors in a subdivision at 11pm at night completely naked . When he tried to enter one of the townhouses, an elderly man living alone panicked and shot him through the screen door. Sadly he was killed. No charges are being filled against the homeowner. Other neighbors had reported him screaming aggressively and banging their doors in the minutes before he tried to enter the old mans house. 

The police are investigating it. It’s seriously weird and bizarre.

BorderlinePDisorder,fr3qmi8,t3_gm9xh5,1589863640.0,"Overwhelmingly, therapists will advise you not to disclose a label. Especially if it’s one that’s a personality disorder.

Think about it. What is the key factor in who we choose to spend our time with? Personality. So when you say  “I have a disordered personality” to a layman with little knowledge or background in the mental health field, that’s pretty scary.

For example, if you say CPTSD instead of BPD, the reactions are very different. Even though as a high functioning “quiet” BPD, my symptoms are absolutely identical. 

You also run the risk of having someone always assuming that anything you do is BPD related because the term “personality disorder” seems to encompass the person as a whole to the average Joe. 

Labels are not even necessary. They key is treating your symptoms. I always explain it to loved ones like this:

 “I grew up in a highly dysfunctional home so I have anxiety around intimate relationships. Love was never safe. Being a highly empathic and sensitive person, I sometimes get overwhelmed easily and inadvertently shut down. My brain biologically just processes feelings, both negative and positive, more deeply which is both good and bad. I’m working hard on it and overcoming it” 

Or just say you have complex trauma or traumatized attachments. 

It’s basically explaining your issues/symptoms without the highly stigmatizing label of BPD."
AskWomenOver30,fr3om27,t1_fr28prf,1589862181.0,"Is 31 really a “Peter pan syndrome” if you support yourself, have a good career and live on your own though? I think that’s a gross misuse of the phrase. 

My friend is in his mid 30s, bounces around living situation to living situation (renting a room from friends or strangers), bounces from one bartending job to another, has a recreational cocaine habit, blows money he really doesn’t have and has this “glamorous” fake online presence. That’s Peter Pan syndrome. He hasn’t grown out of his frat boy days and there’s probably some unaddressed behavioral/mental health issue as well. 

Being an adult does not mean you have to have children and be married. That’s really unfair and old fashioned thinking. Not every women wants kids or if it doesn’t happen for them, it’s okay. There’s en entire Reddit subthread dedicated to people who regret having children. Many admit to doing it due to pressure or thinking that’s what they had to do. There’s also a lot of people with unresolved family trauma having kids and repeating that cycle of transgenerational trauma. 

My father has an MBA from an Ivy League university with a great job in corporate finance but didn’t purchased his first house until he was 37 years old. Why? Because it gave him much more flexibility if he was offered an incredible opportunity when he was young. 

It’s also cultural. Many millennials in Europe rent as compared to own.  Owning a home is a huge commitment and I for one, am not a woman who likes “fixing things”.  I’d rather just call maintenance or the landlord. 

I also know a lot of people who settled down in their early-mid 20s, had kids and now by their early 30s are single/divorced with 2 or more kids. The divorce rate is high; over 55%. Yet people are still spending 20 grand on their wedding which last for a total of 6 hours. 

Also keep in mind people who present themselves as a perfect happy family on social media or in passing are many times not nearly as perfect or happy as they portray. We often don’t know what truly goes on behind closed doors. 

I’ve been with terminally ill patients and overwhelmingly they only regrets had were the ones in such they worried to much about what others thought about their life/choices/decisions instead of just doing what makes them happy."
UnsolvedMysteries,fqzcv7u,t1_fqzbn71,1589764706.0,"First, I think you are very confused on the timeline. Not sure why you think Alexis said he went to the house after or while it was on fire. That was before. The fire was started in the middle of the night/early morning hours. I watched disappeared and never got that from the episode. You can see the timeline online. 

So, to put that to rest for you: Alexis NEVER claimed to have been at the house during or after the fire. It was before the fire broke out. 

The police never said they didn’t believe she couldn’t have left her car in that complex . Her family said that. Although after many years went by, the police now suspect foul play. 

Just wanted to make those corrections"
Vindicta,fqxr1t1,t3_glgwh0,1589736540.0,"I love your list! I just have one thing to correct. I work for a cosmetic dermatologist. 

Ladies, you do not have to add 30 different products to your skin care routine to see great results. It’s a beauty marketing gimmick and a total waste of money. You need 5-7 staples. Any good dermatologist will tell you that. Keep in mind lifestyle has a lot to do with skins appearance and aging. 

I can not stress enough: sunscreen daily (your best daily anti-aging tool), drink a lot of water daily (most people are very dehydrated. Google photos of the woman who dramatically upped her water in take for a month. The results are quite astonishing), 
limit alcohol consumption, get plenty of sleep, work out daily, if you are high anxiety find ways to help you combat this, do not smoke, limit or stop eating sugar (sugar molecules stretch collagen. Sugar actually ages you.) 

Also taking cod liver oil or fish oil high in vitamin A (which is the natural form of a topical retinoid as well as Accutane.) definitely overtime gives your skin a glow from the inside out. This won’t happen if you have a poor diet and just add cod liver oil. 

I’ve always been shocked at the number of women who will spend $1,500 on a facial laser treatment but have a poor healthy lifestyle. In 75% of cases you can achieve similar results over a period of time by using light chemical peels at home, great products and taking care of your health/wellness daily.

FWI: do not waste money on a facial. You will have better results using good products daily. You only want to spend money on in office procedures you can’t do at home. (Deeper chemical peels, lasers, professional microneedling.)"

Relationships are work as it is but this has all of the above obstacles in there to start with.

datingoverthirty,fqhxpee,t3_gizwyu,1589386410.0,"He did give you an answer. It just was not direct which was clearly on purpose. 

He stated he likes/wants zero pressure which judging by his actions actually means • 

 • “I like the idea of having you around when it’s convenient for me. I will place my needs/wants above yours because if I need tons of space but you state you need more time together, I will not compromise.” 

As for his mental health, does it matter? Being emotionally unavailable is still emotionally unavailable whether it’s because he isn’t actively engaged in treating a mental illness or because he’s unsure of what he wants. Why women think that a man not taking charge and taking care of his medical conditions is somehow a free pass to string someone along I will never understand. I’m not saying this is you but a lot of posts ask that question. You are not his therapist or doctor. You can support someone but only if they are willing to work on their issues. 
 
He is absolutely stringing you along. The reason is irrelevant. This will only get more and more frustrating for you. 

If someone is not willing to give you direct or clear cut responses, that’s an avoidance tactic. Giving him plenty of time to string you along without proper communication is self abandonment. If you have an anxious attachment style, this is common. 

He is unwilling to give any decent answers or direction, tell him your needs/wants in a relationship are probably different than his. State that your goal is a monogamous relationship and that you need someone who is at a point in their life where they can invest a normal and healthy amount of time into that. If he is unable to do that, you understand completely but need to look elsewhere. 

I realize that hope and fantasy is sometimes easier than reality but being direct, placing your needs just as important as his and looking elsewhere if he’s unwilling to meet your needs is best."

Vindicta,fq54to2,t3_ggufbe,1589092546.0,"Jenna Dewan Tatum has been and is still drop dead gorgeous. She’s 38. She literally looks 25. 

Why do people think you can’t look gorgeous and young after 25? It’s a bit ridiculous. Women can look young and gorgeous until 40-45. 45 is middle age. 

Google Salma Hayek when she was 40 back in 2008. The majority of college age girls would kill to look like her. Was Angelina Jolie washed up at 30 when she met Brad Pitt on Mr and Mrs. Smith? No.

If you think you’re looks are tanking at 27, it’s definitely lifestyle related. 

If you’re eating high sugar and processed foods rather than vegetables or other highly nutritious foods that’s huge. Working out frequently is also very important and not just for tone but for stress reduction. Drink plenty of water. Limit alcohol consumption. Do not binge drink. Get plenty of sleep. Invest in great skin care products/routine (light at home chemical peels that can be done once a week for 6 weeks are great. Sunscreen. Moisturizer. Retinal A. Eye creams.)  

I worked at a dermatology office and just FYI: long term use of prescription stimulants (adderall) speeds up the aging process. People think metabolism is only related to how fast your body burns calories. It’s not. Every cell in the body has a metabolic process including skin cells. Amphetamines speed up ALL metabolism processes. Long term their effects were quite noticeable."
CPTSD,fq3ymh1,t1_fq3vakt,1589071777.0,"Same! I usually tell people CPTSD instead of quiet BPD because of the insanely terrible stigma and ignorance. 

Funny story though, I can’t tell you how many women I work with in a very professional setting that swap their benzodiazepines and say they have anxiety or what not. Yet I’ve noticed some of their behaviors or reactions are identical to certain BPD traits. Particularly this one girl who had 3 separate emotional meltdowns (had to leave work) when a guy whom she described as a walking red flag, dumped her after two months of “dating”. I felt for her as people who don’t experience rejection that intensely can’t understand, so I spoke with her and she said “oh I’m just bipolar or something” but I asked her if her mood changes are rapid and due to interpersonal relationships. As in her mood could change if someone wasn’t texting her back then 5hrs later did reply. She said “oh absolutely. It’s all based on that.” I just advised her to look into DBT and really stressed getting into therapy as she just picks up RXs and does a quick check in with a psychiatrist every few months. 

My point is I think A LOT of people are walking around with the some of the very same traits or difficulties with emotional regulation just undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. It’s truly unfortunate the label is so stigmatizing and misunderstood. I use to enjoy the occasional crime show but with the talking heads on them frequently implying that BPD is the female equivalent of sociopathy, I stopped watching altogether.

Often personality disorder are passed down through families. My mother remembered after my birth that her father molested her for years as a child. She lost her mind. She was nice one minute and then explosive the next. My father I was obsessed with but he’s extremely emotionally distant and avoids any deep conversations. He goes months maybe even a year without contact but he’s great fun in person. Many unstable women marry narcissistic men. My mothers second husband is also highly narcissistic. His own family can’t stand him. However, both men are wealthy and successful. My mom is so isolated and her clearly untreated PD has only gotten worse. My poor half sister has paid the price. She stunted her personality so much that at 20 she has no drivers license, friends or any outside life except work. My mom became hyper religious and now my sister is to. It’s just bizarre. We had actual diagnosed sociopaths in my family. My grandmother’s sister’s daughter (so my mothers first cousin) killed her mother (my great grandmother) in the 1980s with her EMT boyfriend for the inheritance. They were caught and convicted. 

There’s definitely a genetic predisposition but I find it along shot that a child raised by a parent or parents with full blown untreated personality disorders would not come out of it with one. 

Sometimes people are just to sick. They can’t change what they don’t acknowledge or understand. It’s soul crushing but the only way to break the transgenerational curse of PDs is to get well yourself and accept that their illnesses is not a reflect of you and sadly that’s all they are capable of. Much much easier said then done of course as I still struggle with it but I feel you! 💕"

While I am nowhere near as severe as my mother, because personality disorders often develop from early dysfunctional attachment to the primary caregiver, I developed high functioning Borderline Personality Disorder. It mainly affects my intimate relationships and I’m terrified of real intimacy. Even though It looks like I lead a productive happy life on the outside, It’s robbed me of most of my 20s.  

I had a very contemptuous relationship with my stepmother growing up and my father was the kind that wanted to avoid conflict and just pretend the situation didn’t exist. He was great at playing with me but he wasn’t about to deal with an overly emotional daughter , my early trauma with my mother and the important stuff. 

She’s at a much higher risk of developing a personality disorder (lying and manipulation can be a symptom but not in every case) She’s also just at higher risk of any mental illness as an adult due to her early years. You can’t be diagnosed with a personality disorder until 18 years old but if the therapists sees the signs of one developing, they can treat the symptoms. 

I can’t stress enough getting her into weekly therapy.  
Having a mother deemed unfit is devastating to the cognitive and emotional well being of a child. What she experienced in her first few years of life leave a long lasting impact. 

After she’s in therapy for awhile and she trusts her therapist, they can always bring the two of you in together.

BPD is rooted in trauma/dysfunctional early years (plus genetic vulnerability) Most who suffer from BPD are in a constant day of fight or flight which causes anxiety. There’s also an insecure/disorganized attachment style which causes interpersonal relationships to be fraught with anxiety. The thinking distortions and perceptions also highly contribute to this. While our emotions can change rapidly, anxiety is practically a baseline state for us untreated Borderlines.

If someone states that have been in therapy for awhile and has had a battery of tests, I’d recommend leaving it to the experts. 

None of what you describe is how I personally experience BPD. My fear of abandonment is in the form of physical perfectionism with appearance and being sexually appealing to men.

Parents who are narcissistic can love their kids but they see them as an extension of themselves. Similar to Josh Powell killing his kids as well as himself  in a clear act of spite. The psychologist who examined him prior as part of the legal battle said although he appears loving and attentive, he shows narcissistic traits which therefore means he sees his children as an extension of himself. Timmothy’s mother always struck me the same way by her letters and by her actions prior to this.

It’s also a misconception that DBT is solely what’s used for BPD. 

I was actually originally diagnosed as CPTSD but it’s not currently in the DSM so i was told by my psychologist that she prefers to tell people it’s trauma based or CPTSD because of the huge stigma BPD has. I am also high functioning in daily life and a lot of people think of people with BPD as low functioning, Going strictly by diagnosis in the DSM, I was then officially diagnosed as BPD. The issues and traumas are very similar but people get WAY to caught up in diagnosis instead of the symptoms and entire person,"
UnresolvedMysteries,fplrabg,t3_ge5x6n,1588717964.0,"She killed him. 

I’m quite certain of this for two reasons. My friend who watched a special on the case with me is a psychologist and she said the letter the mother left was not in the vein or tone of most suicide letters. 

This mother’s letter reeked of vengefulness and spite. If you’re unfamiliar, go read it.

While is it true that most mothers who commit suicide and murder their children do so in the same house or area, those letters she left behind made it clear what her motive was for concealing his body. Pure vengeance and spite. 

She didn’t kill herself and her child for the reason most mothers who commit the act do which is: 
- doesn’t want the child to suffer without them. 
- thinks the world is a terrible place so she is sparing the child. 
- they will go to heaven because they are still innocent. 

Her letters instead scream spite. 

Not knowing where Timothy is and wondering about his fate is a lot more agonizing than just discovering him dead beside his mother. 

Second, I know some people go down a rabbit hole of secret groups hiding children underground for their entire life but the simplest answer is very often the correct one in unresolved cases.

The mother’s phone, computer and credit card records were meticulously searched going back many months prior. Nothing was found. Any stranger or “group” she would’ve given Timothy to probably would have become highly suspicious of any abuse story she told when the national news broadcast her bizarre actions and her own families desperate pleas. Not to mention the news stating this woman had a long history of mental illness. It’s extremely far fetched. 

This woman had serious mental illness but she also wasn’t the brightest in planning her own suicide. She initially only tried to use OTC antihistamines to kill herself. That not only has a decent likelihood of not working but it can cause horrendous side effects. 

After awhile when she realized it wasn’t working, she proceeded to slash at her wrists until she got lucky and hit an artery. By contrast, simply hanging oneself by cutting off blood supply will leave you unconscious in 5-20 seconds. After 5 minutes one would die due to lack of oxygen to the brain. I know that sounds terrible but my point being this woman wasn’t that bright or at least not in her final days. 

Certainly not bright enough to leave zero paper trial on her credit cards, phone or computers. The amount of clandestine effort to pull off giving Timothy away to a mysterious group of shadowy figures never to be seen again is slim to none. 

By contrast, it isn’t hard to hide a child’s body in vast rural land. She covered hours of distance on her journey and her vehicle showed clear indications that it had recently been off-road. Unfortunately, It’s like finding a needle in a haystack when you have hours of travel. 

Timothy is most likely deceased and my only hope is someday his remains are stumbled upon to give his family closure."
TalkTherapy,fplliu7,t1_fplitcu,1588714882.0,"Well, it’s not like that. It’s not like you either have a “perfectly normal personality” or “a disordered personality”. Again this is a spectrum involving human traits. There’s a ton of grey area. It only becomes a disorder if it causes distress in an area of your life. 

A lot of therapists think BPD should be reclassified in the trauma category in the DSM. 

The label doesn’t matter. If you’re having issues and symptoms from trauma they will be treated in the exact same way BPD is treated. The treatment for CPTSD is identical to BPD. Some therapists think it’s the same thing. Please check out the website I posted in my last comment. 

Don’t get caught up in labels. If you’re having issues from trauma, go to a therapist to help you deal with those issues."
Anxietyhelp,fplk54n,t3_ge2t4v,1588714158.0,"There are studies in scientific journals that showed omega 3s help with symptoms involved in Borderline Personality Disorder. 

Diet and working out definitely help depression and anxiety. Most therapists specifically encourage clients with mild - moderate anxiety or depression to eat fresh nutritious foods and engage in vigorous workouts at least a few times a week. Not one doctor will ever say that poor diet/lack of physical exercise has little or no impact on mental health. Not one. It definitely can significantly worsen mental health issues. 

Diets high in sugar and processed foods cause spikes in blood sugar which can worsen anxiety and mood swings.

Watch “Supersize me”. After a week of eating nothing but junk food he experienced mood swings, lethargy, irritability but craved more junk food. 

I stick to a diet with tons of green veggies, tomatoes, cold water fish, healthy fats (avocados, coconut oil, nuts) cheeses. I take cod liver oil. Basically a Mediterranean diet minus breads. I workout 4-5 days a week and it helped IMMENSELY. I have high functioning BPD and anxiety is a constant state for BPD. 

Omega 3s are anti inflammatory. Anything anti inflammatory and good for your brain health is good for your overall wellbeing. 

Is it going to cure you of disordered thinking or maladaptive coping skills? No, but a very healthy diet/working out absolutely helps. 

This is anecdotal but you’ll find a lot of people with anxiety or depression say a no sugar or low carb diet improves in their overall mood.

With all this in mind: 

If you just take an omega 3 supplement but still eat a poor diet and don’t work out regularly, the benefits you feel will be minimal if any."

TalkTherapy,fplh6ku,t1_fplchdk,1588712635.0,"Please check out this incredible website. It covers quiet  BPD, BPD in general, early trauma, highly sensitive temperament with attachment issues. It’s incredible and informative.

This girl is incredible on YouTube describing her illness. 

https://youtu.be/MJEQqKqFR0I

Keep in mind “quiet” BPD is not a separate diagnosis than BPD. You have all the same symptoms but instead you “act in” instead of “acting out”. So flight instead of fight. You’re more likely to be originally misdiagnosed with general anxiety disorder or episodic depression. BPD overall is much more common than for example Bipolar. BPD is a spectrum as it involves traits. 

So basically, I have a long standing pattern since my teens of struggles in keeping and maintaining intimate or close relationships. If you met me, you’d think I was a warm extrovert who is fun and articulate. Due to childhood trauma and parental rejection, I put on a “mask” but I have terribly low self worth and no stable sense of self. I can keep friends for years at a distance but if they get to close, I try to keep the image up but obviously they can tell I’m a bit different. If any conflict arises, I run. I’ll just block them (temporarily) or turn off the notifications on my texts. Why? I’m so anxiety ridden at times of potential stress or conflict. I’m the biggest people pleaser which sometimes turns into self destructive behavior. I love to “audition” and try to convince damaged or narcissistic men to want me. It’s bizarre. Healthy men? No chemistry so I go after a more intense relationship. 

I can go from feeling sexy and confident while getting ready to go out but then a negative thought crosses my mind or a comment I take to heart, I then think I’m a hideous monster. I hide it. If that happens I’ll either make an excuse not to go out or binge drink at the event which turns into “omg what did I say or do last night?” Hard to have any sense of self when your emotions fly to extremes even if you don’t show it. 

I struggle with perfectionism as when you have no self worth or image you basically live and breathe off external validation. Not only does it make me feel shallow but it also seems to attract damaged men as if they can sense the vulnerability. 

I won’t be romantically attached to anyone for along time but if I do get intensely attached it’s usually toxic. When the guy ultimately (playboy) decides to fade or doesn’t want anything more than casual, it hurts like as if a husband of 10 years just died in a crash. Sounds dramatic but it’s true. I don’t do it at work or in public (I did it once at work years ago) I will usually pretend to be ill and ask to leave. It works because I don’t get into those situations that often because I fear it now as I know it could make me spiral. 

I’m very intelligent but not being able to handle stress like others has always held me back. I don’t feel like an adult on the inside. The world is scary and I put the mask of normalcy on to work, pay my pills and just survive while looking perfectly normal. I love my bed on weekends as sometimes I’m just so mentally exhausted from living in a chronic state of fight or flight all week but trying to keep it together. I love sleeping pills as it’s an escape from my mind. 

I can’t stick to a hobby for very long. It’s so frustrating . I’ll start out hardcore into it but then after a month or two, I just give up. It’s usually because of an emotional event or stress that causes me to just have enough emotional energy to go to work and home. 

My mind has the emotion of “boredom” so I’ll be shopping online, checking Instagram, thinking maybe I should go on vacation, tinder ect. It’s almost ADHD like but it’s actually just the fight or flight default mode. 

I pick the bad coping skills naturally (without therapy) because they feel better in the moment but worse later on."
Menopause,fpl0eb9,t3_gdot3a,1588704172.0,"Hi! This post came up in my feed and I wanted to share my weight loss tips as a lingerie model in my early 30s. 

I always get nervous posting weight loss tips/maintaining because of the negative culture it can breed. Nobody should “have” to diet or lose weight to be happy. However, it sometimes helps to boost self esteem while going through a hard time. 

First thing, simple sugars are more addictive than cocaine. Unfortunately, it can become a vicious cycle because constant spikes in blood sugars can exacerbate or worsen emotional dysregulation (depression, mood swings, anxiety) It also increases cravings. If you’ve ever seen the documentary “Supersize me” within a week of eating processed foods he becomes more lethargic, moody, depressed and agitated but yet craves more of the food. It’s a vicious cycle. Simple sugars and carbs are also high energy foods meaning if you don’t expand a lot of energy, it can easily be stored as fat.

I have suffer from a highly sensitive temperament prone to emotional dysregulation and anxiety. Cutting out sugar entirely changed my life. It was hard the first week or two but you feel so much better. I do like the concept of keto as its original use was to eliminate seizures but it’s not practical long term and a lot of people eat unhealthy fats (hotdogs, bacon, tons of mayo) with it.

When I cut out sugar my monthly PMS fiber cystic breast pain vanished. My other PMS symptoms also greatly subsided. 

As for sleep. I took sleeping pills in my early 20s. Try magnesium powder. It actually works and I’m not into all natural sleep alternatives but honestly you do feel sleepy naturally. Google magnesium and sleep. Great info on it. 

A diet similar to the Mediterranean diet (lots of green veggies, tomatoes, fish, fish oils (omega 3 do wonders for you mental health) avocado, cheese (if you don’t have an insensitivity or you can buy a cheese alternative) 

Invest in a good probiotic supplement. Seriously. There’s a lot of scientific evidence in journals showing a link between mood, weight and the microbes in your gut. A friend who’s a neurologist stressed this to me. My favorite is an organic based supplement with billions of probiotics. It’s by a brand called Garden of Life. The reviews are overwhelmingly positive. You can order it from their website. Be careful of Amazon as I’ve heard some sellers don’t sell the genuine product. 

As for weight loss... first cut out sugars and junk good. Do not track calories in this 1-2 week adjustment period as it will be difficult time already. You’ll feel an immediate weight loss of about 5lbs in water weight so sugars/simple carbs retain water. Even though it’s only water weight, it does give you that boost to continue. 

As for calories, 1200 will make almost any adult loose weight over but that might not be practical long term or for your life style. 1500 is where I’d start. 

I bought a food scale (under $20 and it gives you the percentage of nutrients)  it helped immensely with recognizing what portion sizes actually are. We have enormous serving sizes in US. Eventually you don’t have to use the scale but it definitely gives you a much better idea. 

I can tell you that intermittent fasting is incredible and works. Our bodies store fat because our ancestors might not find their next meal for days. Obviously, don’t go that long! But our bodies are primed from evolution to store because of the potential of going sometime without food. 

I eat at between 12pm-1pm. It’s my biggest meal of the day. I have a small meal and/or green shake for dinner. Some models eat small 4-6 meals a day instead but I find the big one meal mid day works best for me. You can play with intermittent fasting to see if or how it works best for you and your life. On Sunday’s, if I’m not with friends or have big plans, I go a water fast with some green teas/macha. 

For confidence, pole dancing classes is so fun, Its empowering and a work out! There’s several women in my beginners class that were in their 50s. You can wear a shirt and shorts and it burns calories and all the women are sooooo encouraging and supportive. Salsa dancing is incredible to! If you pick a physical hobby that takes 3-4 night a week it really helps mentally when I’m getting anxious/sad. 

I worked at a dermatology office in my 20s and the best advice for looking incredible at any age is : sunscreen daily, eliminate sugar (sugar stretches out collagen), drink plenty of water every day, don’t smoke and stay active. At home light chemical peels, deep moisturizer and retinoid cream plus a bit of Botox here and there helps confidence (don’t overdo it 💕) 

Therapy is incredible to! 

I’m in bed awaiting covid 19 test results so sorry for the long reply but I hope you can feel better!"
Vindicta,fpkum49,t3_gdx0q9,1588701311.0,"Lose weight. I’m 5’3 and at 128lbs I always felt like I had broad shoulders. I now weight 110lbs and the slight broadness I felt is gone. I realize 128lbs is not overweight but if you have an natural athletic build but prefer a more slender look, it works. I promise. 

Just look at current videos Britney Spears posts on her instagram compared to 2017/2018. She isn’t fat but she has clearly put on 15-20lbs in the last year. You can see she looks more broad. Her waist/hip radio disappeared compared to 2017/2018. She is not fat but without a strict and consistent diet her natural athletic build looks bulky. I love Britney but it’s just an observation. Same with Hilary Duff. She looked so slender and stunning in her wedding photos. She admitted she purposely lost weight for it. She’s always beautiful but a natural athletic body type tends to look more broad/bulky without sticking to a routine diet. If you’re prone to fat storage in the upper body or have broad shoulders that you don’t like, weight loss is the way to go. 

Working out is great for tone, health and maintaining weight loss. However, losing weight is 95% what you eat. 

Nothing wrong with looking athletic or having bigger upper body but I’m just saying if you’d like to get rid of it, lose weight. It works. 

Cutting sugar/simple carbs helps curb cravings. I typically eat one meal a day around 12pm. It’s the intermittent fasting and eliminating sugars that worked fast"

She had just started working both jobs within the weeks prior to her disappearance as she had just finished her GED program. She had no or little money as her uncashed paychecks remained on the passenger seat. As far as I know, the private investigators on her case said they eliminated anyone who was at the black lantern inn that night at least.

BPD is a spectrum and deals with traits. If you’re like me, I have “quiet” BPD (I act inward but don’t act out) and fairly high functioning (I get through daily life but it’s an internal struggle/exhausting) it can make it more difficult to get diagnosed because some therapists only diagnosis BPD if they see extreme acting out behaviors. (Suicide attempts, raging ect) Its outdated and old school but sadly some therapists still maintain that way of thinking in regards to BPD. 

Higher functioning or inward acting BPD is often misdiagnosed as general anxiety disorder, depression, Bipolar II, and ADHD. 

I knew I had BPD a few years before I was diagnosed because I knew I was different and nothing else fit. After reading others experiences with it online and looking at my own patterns with interpersonal relationships and the intense anxiety it beings up, I was certain I had BPD. CPTSD is similar to BPD but not officially a diagnosis in the DSM. They are extremely similar but the label in that case doesn’t matter because treatment is the same. 

You definitely want to get a proper diagnosis if it’s between bipolar and BPD because the treatment methods are vastly different. Medication can help manage symptoms of BPD but it’s intense (weekly) therapy session with a therapist you trust for a few years. Bipolar is more medication based with some therapy sprinkled throughout.

askatherapist,fpjbx4z,t3_gdq1m1,1588663002.0,"One of the easiest ways to differentiate Borderline is if your mood shifts are rapid (mood can change many times in one day) and the mood changes are primarily due to interpersonal relationships. 

For example, if you’re in a decent mood but then this new guy you’re dating hasn’t returned your texts in hours (rapid mood change) however when he finally responds later he apologizes and says he fell asleep (swing back to decent mood). Then a coworker says something that comes off as crude (mood change) 

In borderlines, the mood changes are due to the stress and upsets within interpersonal relationships. . 

Bipolar mood swings do not change based on the ups and downs of interpersonal relationship stresses. While stress can help trigger a manic or depressive bipolar episode, it’s not the cause. Bipolar mood swings can last days or weeks and do not change due to, for example, if a guy you like finally texts you back.

If you see a long term pattern of the same difficulties coming up in forming and maintaining close relationships/friendships over a significant time period and with different people,  that’s also an indication for Borderline Personality Disorder."
UnresolvedMysteries,fpj2mka,t3_gcsz9p,1588654870.0,"Every bill’s serial number was carefully recorded before handing over the ransom money. Not one single bill in almost 50 years has ever turned up In circulation. He died trying. I have no clue if he died landing or whether he died hours or days later in the woods but I do believe it’s more than likely he died. 

One other point: I find it extremely unlikely the mob in the 1970s would want anything to do with hijacking a commercial airliner. The mob made a hell of a lot more money doing a lot less risky crimes and schemes. Hijacking a commercial airliner would make worldwide news and cause an intense manhunt by almost every governmental agency. The absolute last thing the mob would want is that kind of attention for what amounts to pocket change for them."
CPTSD,fpiulpu,t1_fpinvj4,1588649078.0,"I’m sorry they responded that way. Some people truly mean well but they say inappropriate responses to statements about horrible experiences. Some of it has to do with not knowing what to say so they blurt out something ridiculous. 

Many people get uncomfortable with intense or emotional interactions. It’s a known phenomenon that a lot of stage 4 or 5 cancer patients notice that many of their friends become distant after initially showing support. They don’t do this because they’re bad or uncaring people. Many do it because they just don’t know what to say or do in such a tragic situation. 

Not sure how old your friends are but if they’re young, that certainly could be the issue"
CPTSD,fpiteb5,t3_gdkdee,1588648292.0,"Ehh. Be very careful. Otherwise this could easily turn into “my trauma is worse than yours so stop complaining ” rhetoric. Which is not only counterproductive but very invalidating. 

The actual trauma and severity are just one part of the equation. The age in which it happened, genetics and the support system or lack there of all play key roles. 

Some people have genetics that allow their brains to better handle high stress and negative emotions. How deeply individuals process negative emotions is largely genetic. It also depends on how dysfunctional the very early years were. By dysfunctional, it doesn’t necessarily have to be physical abuse. If you’re raised by a parent or parents who have undiagnosed or untreated personality disorders, it’s highly likely that any traumas later in life will be much more profound for that individual. If you don’t already feel safe and secure in the world, any later trauma, big or small, can cause serious issues. 

Having a good support system after and easy access to treatments (money) is also critical. Impoverished kids are much less likely to get the proper therapy and support compared to their middle class or wealthy counterparts. Almost 2/3rds of kids who age out of the foster care system at 18 will end up homeless before they turn 30. That’s a fact. 

Bottom line: There’s so many factors that go into how trauma effects each individual that judging based solely on the type of trauma is ridiculous. Not to mention comparing each persons trauma to see who suffered more is toxic, invalidating and damaging."
TalkTherapy,fpiq10d,t1_fpio5ib,1588646178.0,"Thanks for sharing!! It helps to know there’s people who can relate. 

By “quiet” I didn’t mean introverted I meant I “act in” rather than “act out” or I take flight instead of fight. 

I find the reason my friendships are not for filling for me personally is because I know I’m wearing a mask. I feel like I’m from another galaxy but I have to pretend to be from this planet. That’s why it seems so inauthentic. My fear of abandonment and self hatred translates into perfectionism and maintaining an image. It’s exhausting and it’s not me. I’m afraid if they knew the real me, they would be disgusted. 

I also have faded or dropped friends who’ve gotten to close over the years so that now my life doesn’t feel like it’s a continuum as most but very compartmenalized. Once someone sees any eccentricities or slips in the image, I panic. A good friend of mine who became a roommate in college jokingly said “you’re like an alien.”  

I just always feel like I have to be “on” Therefore after work, all I want to do is sleep or hide from the world. It takes every once of my being to “adult” and try to maintain that image. It’s exhausting."
TalkTherapy,fpio5pj,t1_fpijsqq,1588645018.0,"Thank you for sharing! I know much of this came from my upbringing. Unfortunately, my mother couldn’t bond with me after birth because it triggered flashbacks blocked out sexual abuse by her father. It got so bad my dad had to fly out relatives at some point. She could be normal one minute and very violent the next. My dad was great in person but forgets your existence the minute he walks out the door. He remarried and started a new family when I was 5. He’s very unemotional and doesn’t like to talk about anything deep. As a kid I heard from him every 3 to 4 months. As an adult, I reached out several times asking to remain in better contact (I’m the only one who reaches out) and no change yet I keep idolizing him and chasing a father/daughter relationship. Not sure if personality disorders are genetic but there’s seems to be a plethora of disordered personalities in mine. My grandmother was murdered by my mothers first cousin for money and inheritance. Part of me thinks cluster B disorders are genetic. I haven’t tried attachment therapy, what’s that?"
TalkTherapy,fpignnn,t1_fpig4k1,1588640516.0,"No, I didn’t say that. Those are the main issues I still struggle with on a regular basis. 

FYI: Disorganized attachment is predominantly found in adults with personality disorders."
IAmaKiller,fpie1rv,t1_fpb1qrp,1588638988.0,"I’m a childhood survivor who has serious CPTSD so bad at times I dissociate. I relate to her but with that said she was definitely lying. 

I say this for two reasons but the main one is used by many forensic psychologists: If someone is claiming memory loss of an event due to PTSD, they don’t just go blank on the parts that are incriminating or damning. When she told her story in the first interview, she was very detailed and in perfect sequential order. She never mentioned at any time point in her story of it being “fuzzy or a blur”. Not once. 

Only when she was confronted by the interviewer with the details of the case she left out (spending the night prior, going home only to come back but buying a gun right before. She can say she bought it weeks before but there’s hard proof she bought the gun that Saturday.) did she claim memory loss of those events. That’s not consistent at all with how she told her story the first time. To see if someone is being honest, you look for patterns. If someone only has memory loss of parts of a story that are incriminating but can tell the rest in great detail/sequence, ifs more than likely a lie. 

Also, her body language and manner when confronted screamed of someone caught in a lie. You can see both times her mind racing to find a way to explain how she never mentioned that in the first story."
askatherapist,fpia8ze,t3_gdm5b9,1588636786.0,"Considering that we choose our friends and partners in large part because of their personality, when the average person hears “personality disorder” it’s rather scary or just off putting at best.

Unfortunately, many also can wrongfully assume that if one has a personality disorder that just simply means a character defect. It does not. 

Add to it the explosion in the obsession of True Crime in the last decade. You have a lot of talking heads on TV that will speculate diagnosis of defendants on trial. Borderline is often given the false equivalency as the female version of sociopathy. Hollywood movies of the past certainly hasn’t helped

In regards to therapists: Many years ago Borderline was a label often given to only the most difficult patients or given when no other label fit. This caused many professionals to assume all Borderlines are all extremely difficult. That’s old school and outdated.. You’re unlikely to find that kind of stigma in younger therapists today."
CPTSD,fpi23g3,t3_gddbql,1588632151.0,This happens in people with BPD also. Living at a baseline in the fight or flight state makes it much harder to handle everyday adult stress.
datingoverthirty,fpgyauk,t3_gd2tg8,1588611671.0,"So I actually witnessed this exact same situation with my good friend 2 years ago. She was 29 and he was 43. Both never married and no kids. They met at a some fundraiser and shared a mutual acquaintance. 

This guy stayed friends with A LOT of his dates/hookups. I wouldn’t classify them as actual relationships but more “situationships” because there was either no monogamy or it was brief. Many of these woman were closer in age to him (late 30s) and they chased him or desperately wanted to be with him. One woman in particular continued to hookup with him for a year even after he condescendingly told her “don’t act like we’re even remotely girlfriend/boyfriend with me in front of anyone.” For whatever reason, most remained his friends. 

He fell hard for my friend for whatever particular reason. She’s an independent woman financially but she definitely always wants/needs to be in a relationship. Anyways, they are still together but....

1. None of her friends, including myself, like him. He is extremely overbearing, narcissistic and controlling to everyone. 

He said something rude to our mutual friend once simply because he was in a bad mood and a few days later when my friend apologized (embarrassing) for her 43 year old boyfriend’s behavior, our friend Em replied casually “It’s all good. I doesn’t matter to me if he likes me or not. I’m your friend not his” Well, he overheard this and he was so hurt that she didn’t care if he liked her or not. His reaction was shocking. Talk about a narcissistic wound. I’ve never seen a man react that way. 

The other posters who said it’s more than likely that someone who keeps old hookups around needs constant external validation is absolutely correct in my experience with this. 

Along with that comes certain personality traits that may not show up right away as in the case with my friends boyfriend. 

He had actually tried to dictate how much each person out of 10 people should tip at a friends birthday dinner once. 7 of those people he had never met before. 

I could go on but I won’t. 

They are still together but they fight over her insecurities often which is in part due to him hanging out with a bunch of woman he has had sex with. Not to mention, many of them would go after him if he showed the slightest interest. 

Go for it if you want but if you know you’re prone to insecurity and being anxious, I’d definitely reevaluate if it’s worth it."
UnresolvedMysteries,fpgv4qu,t1_fpcycgp,1588610067.0,Thank you! For the life of me couldn’t remember the same of it.
BorderlinePDisorder,fpguio1,t3_gcw0p0,1588609752.0,"I have a friend who is specializing in personality disorders and is currently working on her Ph.D. 

She said a very prominent and well respected professor is psychology said that A LOT of the Hollywood stars constantly in and out of rehab, having “beefs” with former celebrity friends, attention seeking, highly reactive/emotional at the flip of a dime...demonstrate many traits associated with Borderline Personality Disorder. Yet every single one of them comes out later and says they have “Bipolar II”. 

Example: Oddly, after Selena Gomez has an emotional melt down while live-streaming on Instagram, she later said DBT therapy has been a miracle for her but then later said she’s bipolar. Now, I’m not saying you can’t use DBT for bipolar but it’s generally not the primary treatment. 

Keep in mind BPD is much more common in the general population than Bipolar disorder. 

During one of Britney Spears court hearings in her conservatorship, TMZ obtained one of the filing (most are sealed) that said spears suffers from “a mental health condition that effects her personality.” That combined with her own descriptions of herself as “highly sensitive and easily overwhelmed”, impulsive marriages, child like characteristics, her descriptions of her anxieties ect. She was also prescribed Adderall and was abusing it during her meltdown in 2007 which explains her driving around at 3am. That was given at opening statements by Spears attorney during the trial in which her shady old manager sued her and her family for defamation. Of course, I don’t know whether she definitely has BPD, my only point in sharing this is that a lot of people, famous and everyday people, have BPD traits/symptoms. It’s unfortunately still incredibly stigmatizing so very few are going to come out with it even if they were diagnosed with it."
explainlikeimfive,fpgo9aw,t3_gda1hn,1588606504.0,"Please keep in mind all personality disorders exist on a spectrum. It’s not like you either have a “perfectly normal personality” or “completely disordered”. Human traits exists on a spectrum. Many mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety share a few of the same personality traits that are often elevated in anyone diagnosed with certain personality disorders. 

There’s also dozens of ways that fear of abandonment can show up instead of the the stereotypical raging, obsessive calling ect. Mine shows up as perfectionism particularly in my appearance and people pleasing. 

The reason I’m sharing this is because it took years for me to get diagnosed property because of the outdated misconception that everyone with Borderline Personality Disorder acts in those extreme behaviors. That’s simply a false perception that’s fueled by Hollywood movies and True Crime talking heads in the media. 

Any psychologist that specializes in personality disorders will tell you that’s completely false. There’s also high functioning vs low functioning (which can change). Traits exist on a spectrum and therefore can present themselves in many ways. I’m referred to as “quiet” BPD or “acting in”. It doesn’t mean I’m introverted but that those maladaptive coping skills and traits are acted inward vs out. 

Which makes sense as most see BPD as a form of traumatic attachment combined with a sensitive temperament. Trauma puts someone in “flight or fight” mode. Fight would be acting out and flight would be acting in. 

To be honest I’ve noticed quite a few women I work with, whom were not diagnosed with BPD but anxiety or depression, have a lot of the same behaviors I exhibited except I was very discreet. 

For example, being so distraught you have to leave work because a guy with 50 red flags who you’ve only been seeing a month, dumps you. I would just pretend to have a migraine and ask to leave calmly. It wasn’t often this happened because I knew not to get involved with dating due to my attachment issues and the fact that I also choose guys who were narcissistic and cold. 

Aside from the list of criteria, it’s very common for people with untreated BPD to not do adult things unless pushed such as getting your annual checkup or dental cleanings. We often look for someone to re parent us as just working full time and paying bills is about all that an untreated BPD (mid-high functioning) can handle as we can get easily overwhelmed and have what resembles ADHD. In reality it’s not ADHD but just hard to focus when your mind is chronically in a fight or flight mode. 

Just like two different people with depression or anxiety can present vastly different so can personality disorders. Having emotional dysregulation is extremely common in the population. It’s much more common than bipolar or other mood disorders but unfortunately it often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in those who are higher functioning or act in."
