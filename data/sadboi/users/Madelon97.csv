I take nortrilen now but that one doesn’t do it for me either. You should start with the newest (sertralin or citalopram), they have the least side-effects. Chances are that they make you numb, but unfortunately you have to experience that yourself. 

Good luck and take care!"
depression,fdrzai5,t3_emrpqy,1578691910.0,"Happy birthday to you! I hope you can enjoy it, even though it’s one of the worst days of the year for some of us. Your mom making you cupcakes sounds awesome and sweet. It’s nice to hear that you can be a bit happy about her baking you things and being there for you. 

I hope that things will get better for you. Keep holding on, you can do this!"

depression_help,fa0u2ry,t3_e7f6ij,1575760162.0,"I don’t know if it’s helping her, but I deal with panic attacks and depression as well. In general, it helps me when the other person lets me pay attention to simple things. Such as how many cars are passing by, which color they have, what kind of stores we walk past. But also getting busy with numbers; my therapist says it helps with using the other side of the brain so that there is no room for thinking. Puzzles like sudokus, but also counting down from 100 to 0 with steps of 3 or 4. 

No matter if it’ll help her or not, I think you’re doing an amazing job by wanting to help her the best you can. Bless you guys and be strong!"

depression,f31cbg4,t3_dezigp,1570572158.0,"I don’t know the facts about this, but I’m struggling with the same problem. Right now I live in a psychiatric hospital clinically, and I get mad all the time at my group mates and therapists. Most of the time it’s not even a thing you usually get mad about. 

Wish I could tell you how to deal with it. Unfortunately, I still get mad all the time. Anyway, I know you can do this! Stay strong"
depression,ewzvsxi,t3_cqqe91,1565901408.0,"Congrats! Good for you :)
I hope you can finish college with the support from your boyfriend. I’m still suffering but I got treatment, asking myself if I can ever get my degree. You’re an example for me. Wish you all the best!"
depression,euj2h67,t3_cgjvw9,1563860804.0,"This hits too close to home. I feel exactly the same and it’s terrifying. People barely understand these kind of thoughts. 
I hope you can find the help you need, as though as it might going to be. Hmu if you wanna talk"
