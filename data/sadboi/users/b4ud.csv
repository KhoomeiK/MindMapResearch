Da meine Intention nicht war, hier einen Circlejerk darüber loszutreten, wer doch wie toll reist, werde ich auf den Teil gar nicht weiter eingehen. Lass dir nur gesagt sein, dass du nicht weißt, wie ich reise.


Der Grund, dass ich erwähne, dass Deutschland im europäischen Vergleich der Englischkenntnisse lediglich Platz acht belegt ist der, dass es meiner Erfahrung nach so ist, dass sich in einer Gruppe, in der alle gut Englisch sprechen, alle untereinander auf Englisch unterhalten und in einer Gruppe, in der viele nur gebrochenes oder gar fast gar kein Englisch sprechen, diejenigen untereinander eben zu ihrer Muttersprache wechseln, und zwar unabhängig vom Land, in dem man sich befindet. Das gilt auch für Deutschland. Du erwähnst als Gegenbeispiel Italiener. Italien ist eines der am schlechtesten englischsprechenden Länder. Das korelliert mit dieser Logik. Auch in schlecht englischsprechenden Ländern war es bei mir aber absolut immer so, dass in Gruppen von Leuten, die eben doch gut oder sehr gut Englisch sprachen, zu Englisch gewechselt wurde, wenn ich dazugestoßen bin.


Übrigens sind ganz besonders die Niederlande und die skandinavischen Länder, wo eben sehr gut Englisch gesprochen wird, genau dafür bekannt. Das ist nicht nur meine Wahrnehmung.
