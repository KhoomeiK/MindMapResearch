BPDsupport,fog7u8t,t3_g7aw5q,1587749051.0,"I know you know that it is not possible for anyone to try to diagnose you without a lot of therapy, and even then, professionals are hesitant to do so on someone as young as you.  Since you spell behaviour with a U, I'm guessing you are in the UK.  It would be great to get into therapy if you are able.  Even if they tell you that it's a long wait, it would still be worthwhile to get in the cue as soon as you can.  In the mean time, I think the videos from Dr. Daniel Fox that can be found on youtube will be of use to you.  Most BPD symptom that you might think you have, probably have a video associated with it.    

Also, no matter how you're feeling, meditation and yoga are things that can help whether or not you are ever diagnosed with BPD. Sometimes they take a while to get benefit from, but you shouldn't let that dissuade you.  The only other advice I can give is to remember that things can get better and you are a valuable part of this world.  God put you here for a reason, and things can always get better. You've got people who care whether you live or die on this board.  Don't forget!"
BPD,fkili2f,t1_fkict5g,1584222836.0,You’re not trash.  The fact that your husband loves you and chose to spend the rest of his life with you is evidence of that.  It’s hard to see it sometimes but you deserve love and you’re a valuable bit of humanity.
BPDSOFFA,fk81506,t3_fgydc3,1583947398.0,"I love toxicfox’s advice.  I do agree that it wouldn’t be your fault, but that is not a lot of consolation once they’re gone.  When my pwBPD goes rogue, I just try to keep her calm and maybe move her thoughts to more pleasant things. Maybe reminisce about good times or talk about thinks that are upcoming that might make her happy.  I guess I am just trying to project my positivity on them when they’re in a dark place.  It is kind of difficult, but a little talking can make a difference."
BPD,fk6ubks,t3_fgqu7g,1583916499.0,"Does it help to know that there will be another FP for you in your future?   The next person may be the one who loves you back properly, the way you deserve to be loved.  I know it’s hard and it probably seems like it will never happen, but that’s why you have to keep your heart open and trust in God. I hope I this helps.  This sort of thinking had always helped me when I feel profound loss of another person."

BPD,fi40w6q,t3_f6c1co,1582131708.0,"It's true that non-BPD people can not understand the fixation of a favorite person.  Telling you to stop fixating is futile.  I get that.  I would just continue to work on your coping skills.  They can help.  They can actually measure the difference in a brain scan before and after you do the things that help to manage your BPD symptoms.  I think watching those Youtube videos from Dr. Daniel Fox is a big help.  I would look for a video of his that focuses on your major concern, which at this point is the idealization of your FP.

As you get continue to grow older and practice skills, it does get easier.  Don't beat yourself up because you are having a hard time.  Just try your best to do the work, and remember that you are who you are and it's ok to be you."

I don’t know how old you are but most of the people on these boards are late teens or early 20’s.  That leaves a lot of time to get better at coping strategies, and plenty of time for all the things you might want out of life. 

Be on these boards, commiserate and learn from your friends here. Get better at life. But don’t give up."

And if they are bored, maybe that’s not a reflection of how they feel about you or how much they love you❤️. You can get bored talking to someone you love.  You could give them a little break and go talk to them again soon.  Try not to get mad or hurt about it.  It’s not personal, people just get distracted no matter how much they love you or love  talking to you. 

Honestly, I don’t know these things because I want there, I’m just throwing it out there as another way to look at the problem."
BPD,fh9p06l,t3_f1zasm,1581386342.0,"I guess there’s no 12 step program to avoid self harm (maybe there is, or at least there ought to be).  In A.A. We advise call your sponsor/go to a meeting. Reason things out. Trust your Higher Power. And take one day at a time.

.This group is your sponsor, so reach out, as you have done.  You don’t have to do it alone. Feels better to talk to people and get their positive energy. If you need to reach out again tomorrow, that’s fine. 

Reason things out.  Think before you act.  Let logic go before impulse.  Think first, act later. 

Trust your Higher Power. When I say Higher Power, For me, I mean God.  Believe in God or not, there is a power greater than yourself.  Ask for help.  Pray only for the knowledge of Gods Will for you and the courage to carry that out. The mere act of asking for help will make you feel better. Quiet your mind as best you can and listen for wisdom. 

Take one day at a time.  Don’t think about trying to keep this up forever.  Just for today.  Just for right now. Right now is more of an achievable goal.  Stick with that. 

Please don’t give in to the urge to hurt yourself."
BPDsupport,fh8io6n,t3_ezjsgp,1581360551.0,"I go to a 12 step program, and it really helps me a lot.  Everyone's heard of Alcoholics Anonymous, but there are also 12 step groups that are more closely suited to your needs.  There's one called emotions anonymous ( [www.**emotionsanonymous**.org](https://www.emotionsanonymous.org)).  There aren't so many meetings, but you could give it a try.  I've never been to one of those meetings, but the meetings that I have been to have had a lot of love and understanding.  There are some meetings in the UK.  Not sure how close they'll be, but its worth a look for sure.  If not, there are online meetings.  The meetings are not specifically for people who suffer from BPD, but I would imagine that if you go to one, you won't be the only BPD sufferer there."
