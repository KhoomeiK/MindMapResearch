Like GRLwood was just beginning to gain major traction and becoming a lot more popular, and Karen leaving the band severed one of their biggest and most major income sources for years to come. It's just not a logical thought process to me. Even if they did start putting out their own music or whatever, they'd be losing a good portion of casual listeners of the band, just based on the fact that not everyone will be following Karen or know about all this stuff happening.

Edit: Thought I'd add that I understand having skepticism and not taking someone's word for it just because someone say they're a victim, innocent until proven guilty is usually one of the best stances to have in a lot of cases.

Like my first instinct with people is to just dive in deep, forget about the ""what's your fav color"" small talks and talk about stuff that usually makes others uncomfortable and stuff.

""It's all in your head"" is absolutely a terrible thing to say to someone with a mental illness. Your brain is literally wired differently from others because of chemicals and experiences. You can't control your depression like that, you can't just flip a switch and make your brain produce serotonin at a correct rate. The best you can do is cope with it.

If you seriously have no one to talk to, call a suicide hotline. There are people there that will try to help you or even just talk about your day, give you a distraction if that's what you need. Take a day for yourself if you can, do the things that you like, if that's taking a walk in nature, doing art, listening to music, or tossing a baseball around.

Keep trying, mate. I know this stuff can be absolutely draining and it can feel like it's all too much, but there will be brighter days, better experiences to have, and happy moments to share with people."

I got mine from a brand called Shinevi for about $10, recommended by a friend who rides motorcycles who wears them to help with the loud engine noises.

BPD,fl23pnw,t1_fl22h7q,1584742242.0,"No problem, I love educating people about things like this :)

There are some parallels to narcissism and BPD, but the main difference is that narcissism leans more towards the 'inflated self image' side of things, and BPD leans towards an 'unstable self image'. So while someone with Narcissism thinks they're amazing all the time, someone with BPD can flip flop between, ""I'm awesome"" and ""i'm terrible"" and many things in between.

The revenge part usually depends on if the person has quiet BPD or classic BPD. People with quiet BPD turn their emotions in on themselves rather than at others, so instead of giving someone the silent treatment to hurt them, they might actually force themselves to not talk to someone in order to hurt themselves. People with classic BPD do those things you described, they lash out at the people who they think have 'betrayed them', because to them they truly have."
BPD,fl22mmt,t3_fm0vty,1584741553.0,"BPD can't be cured sadly. It's not like the flu, more like type 1 diabetes in terms of illnesses.

It's a lifetime disorder, not something that goes away, it can lessen significantly with treatments, but that doesn't mean it goes away."
BPD,fl212wn,t1_fl1zvgq,1584740578.0,"It's definitely possible to go back to the idolizing phase, that's actually something that happens a lot to me. It usually depends on the person and what they've done as to whether or not the grudge stays around for a while or is forgiven, but usually it ends up being forgiven at some point.

Ghosting is actually a super good example as well. Like if a friend I idolize ghosts me, chances are I'll go from worshipping ground they walk on to ""god what did I do to make them hate me so much they don't even wanna hang out with me anymore"" because my symptoms are more internal than external, but people with external symptoms would think something like ""you never cared, you're terrible"". Usually the second they do something to ""make up for it"", even something super small, and I flop back to idolizing them.

For instance, something that happened in my real life was that I idolized my friend very much, and we had made plans for a road trip. She found out she didn't have enough car room, and couldn't take me. I immediately switched from ""you're so amazing"" to ""you didn't even want to take me in the first place, you only asked me to be nice, you like the other people you're taking more than me"" but then the next day she offered me a drink. Something as simple as a drink made me go full 180 about how I felt about her, and I was right back to idolizing her.

Usually, even in one relationship, i flip from idolizing them to loathing them a lot, which is why a symptom or common occurrence in pwbpd is unstable personal relationships."
BPD,fkzms53,t1_fkzlqmz,1584674747.0,"Basically yes, just say something to the degree of ""Hey I wanted to tell you about something I've been dealing with that doesn't seem normal"", list what's been happening, and see if they say anything about BPD.

If they do, then you could begin talking about other symptoms that you've been dealing with or how you feel like these symptoms describe what you'vebeen going through. If they don't, then breach the subject a little and say something like, ""I've heard of some people that have a disorder called Borderline Personality Disorder, and they have some of these symptoms I've been dealing with, do you think this could be something I have?""

Some doctors will think you're just looking for meds or trying to diagnosing yourself, and disregard what you said, which is really sad but is a thing that can happen with BPD since it is a disorder that effects a minority of people.

But remember it will take more than one session to diagnose you and rule out overlapping disorders with similar symptoms, so just stay strong and don't let anyone push you around or dismiss your feelings! I know stuff like this can be really scary when you first jump into it, don't get discouraged if the first psychiatrist you tell doesn't immediately make the connection or tries to say you can't have it, and always seek a second opinion if possible if you feel the one you're with currently isn't taking you seriously enough. You deserve to be heard, listened to, and taken seriously <3"
BPD,fkz4elq,t3_flext1,1584662535.0,"Very much so! It's a symptom of BPD, usually called idolizing. You basically praise the ground the walk on, love them to an unhealthy degree, and become crushed when they don't hold up to the image you created for them. For example, someone could idolize their bf/gf, and a routine with them could be the bf/gf calling them before bed every night. Say one night the bf/gf can't call. The person idolizing would be crushed, and they would either externalize or internalize those feelings, either blaming the bf/gf for not loving them enough, or on themselves, thinking they aren't good enough. Basically going from ""you're the best thing on earth"" to ""I don't know why I ever loved you"" or ""I didn't try enough"" etc etc.

Situate yourself near a charging port if needed, because honestly no one really cares if you're using the electricity there, that's what the plug-ins are there for! If you notice an influx of people, you could begin packing up, pay and leave. If it's relatively slow, then stay as long as you like tbh.

AskReddit,f4n8t6z,t3_dkxv6c,1571686949.0,"Just taking a week off in the wilderness alone. Of course this isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it's honestly so so nice.

Just get a waterproof tent, some prepackaged tinder and firewood or an axe to get it, a cooking pot, some canned food and water, bug repellant if needed, and some clothes for the outdoors. That's really all you need, and you're set for a little while. If you're into hunting, bring your hunting equipment and skip the canned food. If you like painting, bring an easel and painting supplies and let the wilderness be your muse. If you like music, bring your instrument or a portable cd player and sing at the top of your lungs. Just put yourself in the wilderness and let it guide you with your hobbies and with life.

It's incredibly refreshing to not have to worry about anything but pitching a tent, getting fire wood, and boiling water/cooking a meal for even just a couple days."
Tinder,f4n6t94,t1_f4mili4,1571686330.0,"It's not always just sex. It's mostly older guys that do this as well. The guys will buy things for girls in return for things like going out to dinner together, or going to a reunion of some kind. A lot of it is honestly just an older guy wanting a hot young girl to flaunt around, but not having the charm to get one without their money. A friend I had in high school who had just turned 18 at the time would go to dinners with 70+ y/o guys, they'd pay, they'd talk and eat, and the guys would give her $100+ plus dinner costs just for showing up and being nice to him. She strictly never did anything sexual, and made bank doing it. So it all depends on the girl and the guy that wants it."

My town only has one shop, so only so much product is out there. Tell him to mind his business, it's not coming out of his wallet."

UnethicalLifeProTips,et43oy2,t3_c9o2iz,1562443594.0,As well as that you should also add some odd toppings that you like so that it's harder for them to keep it and heat it up for someone else and just make you a new one. Example being if you asked for a cheese pizza it'd be a lot easier for them to just make you the small and keep the large on the shelf in a heater until someone orders one themselves. But if you order a pepper and mushroom pizza it's a lot harder to resell it

AskReddit,esinees,t1_esiac9f,1562016754.0,I'm telling you right now I'm gonna be the first one to buy and read that book if you actually come out with it. I've been to one mental hospital as a young teen for severe depression and even then I saw things that were creepy as hell. I was there for about 4 months and I can only imagine how much you'd see by working there.

But when you get down to it, it's really just a dungeon master creating a universe for your character and other people's characters to explore, and it's actually really fun if everyone in the group is friends."
