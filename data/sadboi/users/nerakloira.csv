I do believe they thought nobody could understand them, but after a while living in the US, especially in New York area, you learn that there are more Brazilians there than you think and you start paying attention to what you talk in Portuguese cuz people might understand you. Those girls were clearly new arrivals and didn’t realize that I could understand them, and who knows maybe not only me.
