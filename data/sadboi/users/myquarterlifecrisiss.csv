however, ive booked a doctors appointment now to discuss it, and I‚Äôve promised myself I will start taking them again tomorrow until this doctors appointment so I can see how when I‚Äôm taking them consistently it is affecting me. i really hope my doctor isn‚Äôt mad with me:( thanks for your comment :)"

- the placement year (work experience is hard to get in psych so this is a great opportunity)
- lots of contact hours - lots of classes to help you understand material, lots of drop in sessions, good for general social life/making friends, and good value for money in terms of the tuition fees!
- you get a ton of books free (again good value for money)
- we get our own psych building 
- good psych society 

only downside is it‚Äôs a new course, so not as high in the league tables and maybe not as organised/well established as ucl‚Äôs, but then again the IOPPN is universally recognised so i guess they know what they‚Äôre doing."

depression,f4v46de,t3_dlp6ws,1571836210.0,"There‚Äôs so many cognitive symptoms of depression that are really not common knowledge/no one really speaks about. Here‚Äôs some Ive been dealing with:

My memory/concentration span is awful, and it‚Äôs so annoying cos it fuels my thoughts of being a completely useless person. I will put my phone in my pocket and literally two seconds later I‚Äôll forget I put it there. I will go on a social media platform or google to look for something specific and I can get distracted for about 20-30 mins before I realise I was on it for a reason, and then I completely forget why I was there and have to retrace my steps. 

I‚Äôve always had a tendency to daydream but having depression and anxiety has amplified that by so much. I‚Äôm so in my head all the time that I zone out in the middle of someone else‚Äôs sentence, Ive missed tube stops before just from daydreaming so much, and I swear it‚Äôs actually impossible for me to follow my lectures at university because of this

I stumble on my words all the time. This is something that makes me really self conscious because its so obvious to me that I am sure it‚Äôs obvious to other people. I stutter and stammer and mix words or sayings up or don‚Äôt finish my sentences because I‚Äôm so in my own head that words just don‚Äôt seem to flow naturally.

I can‚Äôt make decisions. Any decision that doesn‚Äôt require emotion but rather more logical thinking tires me out. 

Interestingly, I am 21 years old and my depression started around the age of 19 and that‚Äôs when I got diagnosed with dyslexia, which had never been picked up on before. I always wonder if being depressed made it harder to work around or hide or brought it out more."
