Empaths,fkml3rr,t1_fkmkh06,1584331811.0,"Exactly the same with this guy. No safety, warmth, no love etc. Majority of women would think he's perfect looking and super hot, where I think he's okay haha, not my first choice but he's definitely not ugly. 

It's interesting. When I first saw him, I wasn't sure I would like him, even physically. I tend to stick to the same kind of guys, but I thought, maybe I should try to expand what I think....but I think it's proving to be a fail all around. At the same time, it's hard because I'm so sick of being lonely :( . 

It is so so comforting to know that you have and do experience the same thing. It can feel isolating at times, as no one around me understands how I am with people, emotions and general connections!

 Thank you for your comments!"
Empaths,fklxcc0,t1_fkgcgzl,1584316639.0,"I totally understand about picking up other people's feelings or emotions. Probably not to your extreme though. I think what I'm trying to explain is different. I think the hiding their feelings, hurt, etc can be true, but usually I pick up on it straight away. Hmmm.

Manipulative and narcissists , I have difficulty with. I think I still have a lot to learn about them and how to spot them!

Thanks for your reply :)"
Empaths,fklwzz7,t1_fkh93o5,1584316424.0,"This. I relate to this. It's exactly how I feel and this makes so much sense. 

I use to shut down people who I felt this way with. I'd meet them, feel nothing/feel like I'm ""choosing"", but I decided end of last year, that maybe I'm too harsh with my decisions and I should try and be more patient to see if I was wrong or if it was just an off day for me, and the thought that some people, like myself, open up more as you get to know them.

 However, the last couple of guys I've met, I've felt exactly this way. The first one was just using me and didn't care for me at all, this one (2nd guy) I'm still trying figure out. There's no ""spark/chemistry"" , we've both been pretty open about the friendship/relationship, except for how I feel and the ""choosing"". A lot of his personality is actually what I look for, he's thoughtful, intelligent, whitty,  travelled, has class, takes care of himself, holds family close, so why am I feeling this way? He's told me about his past and previous women, he's told me he may not be sticking around in my city because of lack of funding for his job,  so what is it. 

I don't know, it's all so complicated and difficult. When I'm with him, it's almost like my body/soul are a rapidly turning ball of energy, but it's not love butterflies. 

Thanks for your reply. I really appreciate it."
