another favorite of mine is 1xÂ½ but its mother daughter incest, im not big on incest but the story makes up for it.

some nice classics: strawberry panic and maria-sama ga miteru"
mangadex,fob0eiu,t3_g6m8k2,1587654677.0,"I basically just read yuri, if u like it or willing to try it out heres an list coming from an expert (me).

Citrus: A classic, probably the most well known, it had me screaming a lot

Strawberry Panic: Another classic, but less well known to those outside of the yuri community. I believe it was the first one I ever read so it's been awhile, but it was good enough for me to fall in love with the genre.

Maria-sama ga Miteru: Same points as Strawberry Panic tbh, they're kind of similar

1xÂ½: This is mother daughter incest, so if u don't like that it's understandable. I'm not really into incest either but this manga is still my second favorite and pretty interesting.

Tadokoro-san: My most fAVORITE manga ever. There's a webtoon version and a manga version. It seems like the mangaka makes the webcomic first and then their publisher gives them advice on how to make it more refined for the manga release. I'd read the webtoon first so you can see how it's improved when you read the manga after."

wjsn was my first girl group and one of my favorites. their mvs are so aesthetic and their songs are catchy. theres 13 members but they havent had an ot13 comeback in awhile since the china line has been busy, and now one of the korean members will probably be casted in a kdrama, but theyre still great to get into.

dreamnote isnt as popular but they still have cute songs and great performances, singing totally live even for their debut, which is what really impressed me and got me into them.

gidle just had a comeback, im not as into them but i think theyre overall great with nice songs and mvs and their new song has been stuck in my head a lot.

im not too into loona yet, but ive been learning more about them recently. a lot of people love them and they deserve that love, they seem pretty great."
