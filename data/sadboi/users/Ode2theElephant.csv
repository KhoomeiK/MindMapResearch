The article does mention that studies vary in results but most come to this conclusion, reply asking again if you want another link or wutever

(P.S.- this was the second link on google, the first did seem to be in your favour but it was only taking info from one source)

The actual correlation is that if you have and for of Schizophrenia then you have an extremely high chance to smoke pot, both at a younger age and more often then people who do not have Schizophrenia. 

It is proven that pot doesn't cause it explicitly, but can make symptoms worse."
TwitchMains,faybqjp,t3_e2wfcx,1576398105.0,"I know this post is kinna old, but I hope this helps

I def pref bloodrazor, but I recommend building bloodrazor for getting the on hit damage. The reason people did twitch jung for a while was the on hit damage that only the jg can build stacked with bork, BUT it is all up to pref tbh

I recommend trying a Basic machete start with 3 pots and just leaving your jg item alone for a bit just go BF rush into boots and 3 daggers, build the daggers into boots and recurve and then use the recurve for bloodrazor ( if you recall with extra/short of gold then buy extra daggers)

I found a sweet spot at 1.7 atk speed but this is prob down to preference also

Hope you find a build that you enjoy (that also works well so you don't get flamed, RIP AP Twitch)"

Alot of people seem to hate it due to its wrighting saying that its a bad portrail of mental issues and coping with them. I think the main character was gay also, but I might be wrong? The main character has a freind who commits suicide at some point too, but he hallucinates her alot and I think he ends up hallusinating other people who died at points in the show. If I am not mistaken them at some point he thinks a Meteor was gonna hit his hometown as one of his delusions.
