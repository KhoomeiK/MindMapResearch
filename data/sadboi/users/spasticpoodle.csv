The main engine on that freighter is the same general design (low speed, direct reversing, air start diesel) as what I work on, albeit my engine was built in 1934. When installed, it made my tug the most powerful tug on the west coast. (I say ""My"" tug, but it's owned by a non-profit maritime heritage organization.)"
CatastrophicFailure,fmmh7pe,t1_fmm6n0p,1586205209.0,"I'm not the guy who you responded to, but I know enough about this kind of stuff to be dangerous.

1. When coming into most ports, the ships are required to take on a pilot. The pilot is someone local who knows the port well, and takes control of the ship to help with navigation and such. When the pilot comes aboard, they are the one in control of the vessel, but the captain is still liable for whatever happens. It's kind of an odd setup. Anyhow, the pilot knows the port, but may not know the peculiarities of each ship.
2. Container ships like this generally have one or two HUGE engines, and no reduction gear. This means that the engine is connected directly to the prop shaft. Reversing is done by shutting down the engine, and then restarting it in the opposite direction. To start the engine, compressed air is used. If the aux compressors aren't banging away at 100%, or the pilot calls for too many reverses, the air supply can become depleted, and the engine won't restart until enough pressure has built up.
3. Freighters weigh a metric fuck-ton, and therefore, have a metric fuck-ton of inertia. You think it takes a train a long time to stop?

What I suspect happened here is a few things:

1. Looking at the exhaust, the engineers are black-stacking that engine; it's running balls-out full speed.
2. Looking at the prop wash, you can see the rudder. If the engine was in full-ahead, you wouldn't be able to see the rudder, because the prop would be washing water over it. This tells me the engine is in a full-reverse state.
3. Because you can see the prop wash and rudder, I suspect the ship is empty. This is good and bad. Good because there is less mass, and therefore less inertia. Bad, because all of that frothing water is thrust that isn't going toward stopping the ship.

Edit to add: SOmeone else pointed out prop walk, and that's probably in play here as well. Along with thrust applied along the axis of the ship, a propeller will also impart a lateral force dependent on the direction of rotation. Propellers are designed to minimize this force while running forward, but in reverse, the prop walk will pull the stern to one side or another. Since this ship is in full-reverse, prop walk will be maximized. I suspect the pilot panicked, called for full reverse, and didn't consider the effect that the prop-walk would have on the ship... It basically pulled the ship right into the wharf and crane. This makes me think more that it was pilot error more than a mechanical issue.

From this, I'm assuming that there was either a mechanical issue that prevented the application of reverse thrust until it was too late, an overconfident pilot who was unfamiliar with the specific quirks of this ship, insufficient tug assist, or a combination of all of these. I don't think weather was an issue, due to the seemingly calm water."
