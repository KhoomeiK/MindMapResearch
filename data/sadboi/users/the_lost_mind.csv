misanthropy,fhc86fy,t1_fhc2wgt,1581458137.0,"It annoys me how humans can act this way towards people without caring. But that‚Äôs the thing, they all care for what other people have to say if it increases their social status, clumping together through falsity as some form of a social defence mechanism. I‚Äôve seen tons of people in my school turn into rabid dogs as a means to be popular. What makes it even more disgusting is that they don‚Äôt see how foolish it all really is. I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that. It‚Äôs unfair that those who are mean and horrible get to be happy. I‚Äôve never had issues with my sexuality or gender but I‚Äôm not really like other girls either and have struggled to fit in, but then I stopped caring what other people thought and that made me feel really free. When you think about it, male, female, straight, gay, is doesn‚Äôt define who the person really is. It‚Äôs like the name of a person, it doesn‚Äôt have any actual meaning besides being used for practical purposes. I used to try to get things like this across to people but they‚Äôd blank out and start talking about something trivial instead. So I stopped trying, stopped caring - and trust me, I used to care so much for what other people thought. I couldn‚Äôt stand up for myself or be myself. Now it‚Äôs almost the complete opposite. But the thing is as well the stuff I say on here id never say to anyone in real life, because I couldn‚Äôt have the energy to face the backlash, and that makes me think, what if people like us are out there, speaking to us already, but are hiding their thoughts too, maybe that could be the problem?"
misanthropy,fhbj6by,t1_fhbcqfk,1581443362.0,"Initially I couldn‚Äôt connect with females - I still mostly can‚Äôt, especially the really extraverted ones who have the ‚Äúlive in the moment, yolo‚Äù kind of attitude. But I forced myself to be more affectionate to those I somewhat like. Girls would show a lot of physical affection to each other - touching arms when talking etc- and so I tried to do that because I wanted to have affectionate relationships with my friends too. So I did it, even tho it felt fake,  but now it‚Äôs real and I‚Äôve grown closer to people and talking in group situations feels a lot more natural. That‚Äôs  something I changed. I wrote a reflective essay for English about nihilism and misanthropy and it taught me that, well, yes, humans aren‚Äôt perfect, because we have emotions, those that are good and those that can turn bad - jealousy etc, which I think is the worst quality anyone could have. For me I‚Äôm a misanthropist because people don‚Äôt focus on things like why we are here, why do we die, what does it all mean etc. But honestly sometimes we have to accept that humans aren‚Äôt perfect, nobody can ever be 100% kind, and I learnt to accept that. I‚Äôm not a good person at times, I could lie a lot, be unreliable and impulsive about things sometimes. But laughing about those things with others, and others laughing about their flaws with you shows an acceptance of this nature of humans. I know I‚Äôm insane as well, and I think insane is when a person who had high hopes for the world comes to terms with its harsh reality. Everyone in this subreddit is here for a reason, whether someone has harmed them, or they are too different from other humans. But what changed for me is that there was no point to me isolating myself completely and doing nothing but watch society fade away, I looked towards the future and marked big goals - write a book, do medical research - no matter how unrealistic (well some form of realism of course) and dedicated myself to those goals. I think you need to tell yourself what you really want in life and go after it. People like us are different from others, and our minds shouldn‚Äôt be put to waste. Apologies for the slight cringe of this all. I‚Äôm an INTP (sometimes I get given INTJ)  by the way!"
misanthropy,fhb7g2r,t1_fhb59y2,1581436413.0,"I write a lot of creative stories - gothic literature specifically. Usually I just think of an idea then start writing and let my instincts guide me. I also write a diary too which helps me understand a lot of things and think clearly about them. I always write whilst listening to music because it distracts you from the world so you can get lost from it for a while. Having someone to share them with is also why I like it. I‚Äôm in school so having a teacher read it and give feedback allows me to create goals and work towards them. I‚Äôm a misanthropist because I know that if I wanted to I could connect with humans by conforming to what they do and how they act etc but it‚Äôs all fake and superficial - it feels like I‚Äôm watching a play where everyone‚Äôs acting like the same character. I just don‚Äôt understand humans at all anymore. I‚Äôm not sure how the future will play out for the both of us, but at least compared to the rest of humanity we are actually real and thinking about things individualistically rather than relying on what others have to say. I‚Äôm terms of people lying to themselves I have that to, but mainly because I‚Äôm a bit of a nihilist so when people make big deals out of tiny things it bothers me a lot, or if they pretend things aren‚Äôt happening when they are it can be frustrating. To the future however! I guess we have to keep some form of hope to stay in control of ourselves."

Paranoia,fgf52j5,t3_ey23en,1580724864.0,"Ur not alone. Sometimes I get the same thing. When I‚Äôm walking with my dog and someone‚Äôs walking towards me I prepare myself for how I‚Äôd act if they‚Äôre going to murder me. Honestly, I‚Äôve had paranoid thoughts since I turned a teenager and it‚Äôs still hard at 17 years old. 

I remember every year at New Years id tell myself this year you‚Äôre going to learn to keep them in control. I never fully confronted them tho, or asked for any help, I kept them all to myself.

For me I accepted that they were something I was always going to feel, I didn‚Äôt exactly say those words out loud but subconsciously I told myself - If that makes sense. 

There are some good effects to paranoid thoughts tho, and I figured that looking at the bright side a little helped because it helps you understand yourself more. For me, being paranoid meant I wouldn‚Äôt do anything reckless and could keep myself safe. The bad effects of course are that I was always on edge, not really ever at rest.  But that‚Äôs okay as long as it‚Äôs not interfering too much with your life. 

I‚Äôd make jokes about my paranoia to my friends and having them laugh back makes you feel somewhat normal and helps you to deal with them. 

For me, its, this is who I am, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm a little paranoid at times because it keeps me in control. But that‚Äôs not true either at times, because it can drive me absolutely insane, tell me lies, make me believe things that aren‚Äôt true to the point where I‚Äôm confused about everything. I overthink absolutely everything and analyse everything and mix up my own feelings a lot. I know it‚Äôs never going to go away. 

It was horrible at first, I‚Äôd never felt so much pain. It was all new and I couldn‚Äôt digest any of it yet. But I got through it,  and now it‚Äôs normal to me. Yes I still feel pain a lot and can‚Äôt ever seem to let things go, but in a more matured and controlled manner.

The advise I should be given is seek help and therapy. Maybe that would have helped me, maybe it wouldn‚Äôt have. But I wanted to give you an honest answer. Everyone is different so maybe unlike me you want rid of them completely. And maybe you have gone through this for longer than me.  But I think you know yourself what you need and how you really feel. Going on Reddit and reading others experiences and writing about my own really helped because everyone on here can understand each other in our own special ways. I would never have thought that speaking online would actually have helped. Maybe that‚Äôs another option, try something new. I‚Äôm planning this year to take up a new hobby, just to see how it works. 

I apologise for the length of this. Just know that you are not alone and focus on what you need and feel. üòÄ"

ForeverAlone,fcgvouq,t3_eh38hw,1577644391.0,"I have the same problem. A guy I was sort of close with for lots of years used to be shy and friendly and now is overconfident, brags, and it annoys me how much he‚Äôs changed and he doesn‚Äôt even realise it. However, I believe that underneath people never change. I think people are good at covering up their past, but can never truly let go. I think cutting him off is all you can do, why surround yourself with people who can only hurt you?"

depression,fbtvces,t3_ee58qm,1577097865.0,"Hey I know exactly how you feel. One time I told my mum I was depressed and all she said was ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt cope at university then.‚Äù All I receive is constant manipulation and for the very first time today I went to go out with my friends and she made me feel guilty for going out, so I‚Äôm not going now because I feel worse about myself and my friends didn‚Äôt care anyway when I said I couldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure what advise I can give, all I‚Äôm doing is studying as hard as possible to escape. I guess I just want you to know that you‚Äôre not alone, even though it feels like it. üòä"
