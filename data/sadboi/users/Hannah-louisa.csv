I was not trying to advocate people going off their medications without good support. And apologies if it comes across that way. 

It may be the case your case requires longer term medications and therefore advise you’ve received in your instance could well be appropriate to you. 
However I would be a little skeptical of anyone who peddles the exact same advise to all the individuals under their care. Particularly in psychiatry. Things should always be risk benefits decisions taken in a way that includes your thoughts and wishes. And sometimes certain psychotic symptoms do eventually become acceptable to certain individuals. For example I have a good friend who has made peace with the voices he hears and he now manages without medication. Again that isn’t to say it is something everyone wants to manage with but people should have choices about how to manage their symptoms because after all we are all different."

You’re talking bullshit if you say everyone who has experience of psychosis needs medication for life. 

Many people which psychotic symptoms will never take medication and live full and productive life. You take medications if your symptoms of psychosis interferes with your ability to function and medication helps you personally. Any shrink who automatically tells you anyone  who has symptoms of psychosis that requires life time medication is an absolute moron and needs their license revoked.

What one person experiences as stressful or traumatic can vary dramatically though. And what one person might find traumatic another may not. 

There are some hypotheses that subsequent episodes require less stress to set them off and eventually may occur randomly in some individuals. However this is debated. 

Some people find they have more of a seasonal variation to their episodes or are triggered by sleep deprivation or more physical than emotional stress."

Sadly the nature of mental illness is that there is no easy definitive answers. Even with a diagnosis there is no clearly defined way of helping people. It’s a lot of trial and error and experimenting. 

You may well find it’s a one off episode that gets that bad though. Certainly for me so far, I’ve only had one really really bad episode that landed me in hosptial. I live in fear of it happening again but hopefully won’t. The further episodes I have did not get to the same point as my first one."

The fact I recognised them as strange/not real they tell me is evidence I wasn’t fully psychotic and therefore only hypomanic rather than manic.

bipolar,fomyizn,t3_g8duxm,1587907665.0,"Are they associated with a mood episode? 

If linked to your depression then could be bipolar 2 still theoretically. Although psychosis in bipolar is more commonly associated with manic states and therefore bipolar 1. 

If you’re hallucinations aren’t happening during a mood episode however, then the psychotic symptoms probably aren’t bipolar related. 

It’s possible to have more than one diagnoses too so just cause your experiencing psychosis doesn’t have to mean you’re not also BP2

It’s important to remember that brief psychotic type symptoms aren’t always pathological. A lot of mentally “well” people experience things that could be labelled as hallucinations and don’t warrant treatment. For example feeling your phone vibrate in your pocket when it hasn’t is technically a tactile hallucinations but doesn’t qualify you as being psychotic or needing treatment."

bipolar,fj17639,t3_fay96m,1582914209.0,"My mirena has been fantastic. I’m likely bipolar 1 rather than two though. 

I had a fair amount of irregular bleeding when it first went in for the first month or so, but then things settled and now my period is much lighter. Some people’s stops all together. 

I didn’t find the insertion painful but had very bad cramps for a few hours after, required regular pain killers to manage them. However I’ve always had horrendous period cramps. So wasn’t really significantly worse than those. Now because my periods are lighter though I have no cramps when I’m on so the short term discomfort was absolutely worth it. 

There is a risk you can expel it and with have contraction type pains with this but the risk is fairly small. 

Id certainly recomend it on the whole as it’s more effective at preventing pregnancy than having your tubes tide, but equally is completely reversible. You don’t have to remember to take a pill and once it’s in it can be in for up to 5 years so very low maintenance really

bipolar,fj0dc2u,t1_fj03wxc,1582897096.0,"No. She assesses my mental state and response to medication. 

I get blood done by a clinical support worker (or sometimes colleagues or myself at work, since I work in a hospital)"
bipolar,fiys9i1,t1_fiyowcw,1582845798.0,"Do they use charcoal in the states? 

They don’t bother with it in the UK anymore"
bipolar,fiys6yg,t3_fakhcr,1582845753.0,"How much were each of the tablets?

If you took 8 2.5mg tablets you’ll probably just sleep for a very long time"
bipolar,fiykksq,t3_fajrw9,1582841218.0,"I see a doctor like one every 3-6months 

See a nurse or psychologist almost weekly"
bipolar,fiygbz0,t3_faj7st,1582838866.0,I’ve always been told/read that it takes about two weeks to properly work.
bipolar,fiyf8vi,t1_fiyeahz,1582838265.0,"Thanks, I’m fortunate to be in the position to look for alternative help. And have the knowledge to recognise when I am receiving substandard care. I feel for those who cannot"
bipolar,fiy75vc,t1_fiy2juj,1582833854.0,"Don’t worry I have made the decision myself. I discussed with my nurses and have been open about it. But I know my rights and I understand pharmacology, and frankly I don’t trust my doctors opinion. She know less about the drugs she’s prescribed me than I know about them. 

Im a medical health care professional myself although I work in physical health so I understand pharmacology. I’ve also made an appointment to see a private psychiatrist cause this doctor I’ve been seeing is a moron."
bipolar,fiy1qpd,t1_fixg73z,1582830774.0,"The trainee psych I see in the UK refuses to believe you can take less than the “target” dose... 

So I’ve reduced it myself"
bipolar,fix89cp,t1_fiwr1y4,1582814985.0,Yes but I’m on 1/4 of the original dose
bipolar,fiwm71k,t3_fa3a4v,1582791964.0,"It’s a subject of much debate. 

Some believe yes, some feel no and sat it simply “uncovers” latent bipolar... 

The stuff I’ve read indicates if the hypomania/mania resolved quickly after stopping the drug it’s more likely caused by the drug. If the symptoms persist for a long while after it’s more likely underlying bipolar. 

But there isn’t a great deal of consensus on the topic"
bipolar,fiunmnx,t1_fiuivo3,1582744834.0,I think if you find them more helpful than an hindrance then no issue with taking things long terms but my episodes have always been quite distinct and short term then I have long periods between even off medication and while euthymic the medication I’ve tried cause me more issues than are helpful.... I need to give lithium a try I guess before I completely make up my mind to give up on longer term prescriptions
bipolar,fiuhtpy,t3_f9wazj,1582741671.0,I do when I’m in my manic episodes I feel very unsafe alone during them. However the rest of the time I’m fairly okay with my solitude
bipolar,fiuhk5i,t3_f9xdr1,1582741530.0,"I fully agree that I meet criteria for the diagnosis as outlined in the DSM. 

I am skeptical of what that means for me personally and the “requirement” of life time medication as is indicated in a lot of the literature."
bipolar,fitmxe0,t1_fitg9m9,1582724592.0,My experience of hospital in the UK is it’s only fast tract to medications. Besides that it wasn’t particularly helpful to me at all.
bipolar,firo68g,t1_fir3z6q,1582668117.0,"Yeah, but I never had lots. 

If you find the hormones of other types of contraception make you worse it’s good though as used minimal hormones, it’s just localised progesterone to your uterus. 

It’s better than the copper as your periods tend to get lighter or disappear where as with the copper coil they are more likely to get heavier and sometimes more painful."
bipolar,fir3lgm,t3_f9f01m,1582656684.0,The progesterone IUD has by far been the best I’ve tried.
bipolar,fio3d7y,t3_f8wdgh,1582575502.0,"Work, although I wish this was part time as full time feels like I have very little time for anything else."
bipolar,fio1y8b,t3_f8vs3p,1582574716.0,"I have to basically cut my mum out of my life for periods of time. And generally make a lot of alterations to how much I allow her to know about me and be involved in my life. 

It was a horrendously painful and challenging 12-18 months. We have now managed to have a slightly more positive relationship although the nature of it is very different to the past. 

If cutting someone out is what you need to do don’t beat yourself up over it. If a permeant separation is necessary then that’s okay too but equally sometimes time and space right now doesn’t mean it has to be over forever, and you can decide later if you want to reinvest."
bipolar,fio1842,t3_f8vw01,1582574309.0,"How much under 50mg are you taking? If you’re dropping from 50mg to 25mg that in itself is quite a significant change. 

Perhaps it might be possible to get some liquid form, rather than tablets so you could drop more gradually? So go from 50mg to closer to 45mg for example?

Also what’s your reason for coming off? If you’ve already tapered down a fair way would you consider stay at the lowest dose that allows you to sleep for a longer period of time?"
bipolar,finw9d8,t1_finujz4,1582571444.0,"Ah I’ve reduced to 100mg from 400mg cause the reduction to 300mg did nothing to help with the oversleeping. Haven’t had any manic symptoms... even when I’ve missed a few days previously.

My Dr isn’t impressed with my reduction cause she said it’s pointless being on less than 300mg. She’s not a psych though and I’ve been told by friends who are training in psychiatry and psych nurses that sometimes a lower dose works just as well"
bipolar,fintmle,t3_f8vtc6,1582569924.0,"Please let me know if you find out! 

How much you on? I’ve reduced mine considerably which has helped to a degree but I’m experiencing rebound insomnia atm so debating going back up again"
bipolar,fintc6g,t3_f8vnt1,1582569756.0,"Everyone ones experiences is quite different. Some people have a seasonal/cycle pattern to their moods/episodes. Some people’s are predominant triggered by high stress situations. 

On the bright side most with bipolar 1 have fairly decent length periods of euthymia- or “normal/stable moods” between episodes. Sometimes this can last years.

Seems a bit weird you psych didn’t tell you your diagnoses... I find it really strange how secretive some of them are about their “assessments” of you"
bipolar,fihnm1x,t1_fihlnni,1582412296.0,"Yeah I’ve thought about it on an off through life a lot. Theoretically it would be an insulin OD just like my uncle opted for, but given I dont give out insulin much these days it’s not in easy supply for me and having to store it in a fridge for a rainy day when you share a house with people who know you’re not an insulin dependent diabetic might prompt questions...

I never really thought hypothetically planning it was pathological... thought I was a fairly normal thing to think about given how common suicide is... only in recent years have I properly thought about it in a genuine how might I do this type way"
bipolar,fih9x85,t3_f7z4jg,1582408045.0,"I know people who do drink on both. They say they have keep consumption pretty low. I’ve drunk on seroquel, it hits you quicker and makes you drowsier so you have to be a little more careful than you do if you’re not on."
bipolar,fih0jhw,t1_fifv1to,1582405251.0,"I’ve always sought help before my manic and psychotic symptoms took full effect, even during my first. It was health care professionals who failed to respond until I was too unwell that was my biggest issue first time round. Second time again i saw the signs before any family, friends or mental health professionals did."
