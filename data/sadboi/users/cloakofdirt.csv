knitting,fjegq2z,t3_fcv22r,1583271334.0,"Hi, I need advice on a possible blanket commission. 

I have a personal blog where I share my knitting and recently had someone contact me requesting a queen-sized blanket in 'very soft yarn'. They weren't specific about the yarn or pattern they wanted. I was upfront about how yarn can be expensive and hand-knitting is a time-consuming task, and they claimed they're willing to pay up to $400 for the yarn and wait a year, which I think is around the time and yarn I'd need. As for the pattern, they simply requested my 'artistic taste' and 'something I love'. 

This would be my first time making a blanket, I usually stick to shawls. So I guess the advice I need is: how long does it usually take you to knit up a queen-sized blanket? What sort of yardage would we be talking about? Am I insane for considering this?"
BPD,fiw6jmw,t1_fivw0g0,1582776428.0,"I'm in DBT, working on both BPD And C-PTSD (i have both) with my therapist, and I'm also in a long-term relationship with someone who honestly has the patience of a saint. I know I'll feel loved again one day, I'm just still (re)learning what real love is."
BPD,fivaxhy,t3_fa0jpz,1582757101.0,"Oof, mood. Today my gf said something along the lines of 'all I do is draw stuff and send it to one person' and my brain managed to make the leap from 'she hasn't sent me any drawings' to 'she's cheating on me' in about two seconds. All this before 7am, lol. 

I'm trying to treat it as exposure therapy tbh. The more I'm forced to sit with the uncomfortable reality that my SO has a life outside of myself, the easier it gets to tolerate that discomfort, and the less reactive I get. It's painful but ultimately worth not hurting her (and myself) with my overreactions."
BPD,fivags3,t3_fa0toj,1582756877.0,"<3 first of all, same. I've never had a birthday that didn't involve me sobbing my heart out at some point in the day. 

What helps me is first of all validating that birthdays are extremely difficult. Acknowledging that they're days that bring up a ton of trauma and bad feelings can help with the feeling that you're failing to meet some weird birthday expectations, and it takes some of the pressure off. Then, consider doing something nice just for you-- if you can afford it, go buy that thing you've wanted for a while but never got around to buying, get yourself a nice dinner, watch terrible TV. Put on a sad movie so you have an excuse to bawl your eyes out if you need. This is a particularly hard day, so pull out all the stops when it comes to coping. Cancel plans if you gotta. If all you do today is survive, that's okay. 

In my experience birthday's aren't fun days of celebration, they're the day where you lock yourself in your bunker. Emotional doomsday. Acknowledge how difficult it really is and treat yourself extra-kindly to compensate. Survival is the goal, and if you're still breathing when midnight rolls around, you've done everything you needed to.

Also, happy birthday <3"

Anything I can look to as ""proof"", like a drawing they might do for me or a gift they'll buy me, anything I can go back to even while they aren't around. Emotional impermenance is a big thing for a lot of pwBPD including myself-- we can't remember what it's like to ever feel an emotion if we aren't currently feeling it, including 'feeling loved', so if we aren't feeling loved at a moment it's hard for us to imagine that we ever did feel loved.

And you're spot on-- my addiction is so debilitating, in part, because I struggle to know who I am without it.

I'm in DBT therapy now and working hard to learn the skills and I hope that as I accumulate more positive experiences and improve as a person it will be easier to give up the crutch that is booze for me.

EDAnonymous,ewasf0c,t3_cnhhyi,1565250777.0,"TW NUMBERS weight is fake 

I've been super lax about my eating habits for months. Eating so much sugar and shit. I LOOK fat. My thighs are disgustingly thick. My stomach sticks out uncomfortably far. My face is pudgy. i look disgusting. 

Finally got a scale yesterday, weighed myself-- 52kg. My low weight. The scale must be wrong, I thought, and I was mad because I wasted money on it. So I double-checked with my roommate's scale. 52kg still. 

I don't fucking get it. I KNOW I've been eating well above maintenance each day. I've been exercising a lot but not nearly enough to have caused me to lose. I look disgusting, fat, pudgy, I'm visibly thicker than I was a few months ago. My legs spread out in a way they only do when I'm 55kg+ 

I'm genuinely baffled. This is upsetting me so badly. I do not look like a woman who's 52kg. I look like a woman who's reasonably at least 56kg but probably more. Could both my and my roommates scale be off? Or is my body dysmorphia just far worse than I thought?

I might have a tapeworm or something lol"
EDAnonymous,eupic4i,t3_ch4qq8,1563957541.0,"First of all, I'm so sorry you're going through this. This is absolutely atrocious behaviour on their part. It seems like they deliberately want to tear you down, and I'm guessing it won't matter what your weight is to them, that how you look isn't the issue here-- the issue is their nasty attitudes. Even if they aren't scheming to make you fat, they're deliberately ignoring your boundaries, pressuring you into eating when you don't want to, and saying hurtful things to you. That isn't okay at all and you have every right to be upset. 

I don't have much advise, I just wanted to reassure you that you're perfectly justified in being upset with this behaviour and not trusting their intentions. I wouldn't trust the intentions of people who constantly belittled me and ignored my boundaries either. Hell, most people wouldn't. Unless moving out is an option I guess you could try treating them the way you'd treat any bullies: give as much as a non-reaction as possible, don't openly express being upset, don't actively refuse food and argue about it but give non-committal responses like ""I'll save it for later"", or just throw it out or give it away.  

It's impossible to say whether they're deliberately conspiring to make you fat, but they're doing things against your wishes to upset you deliberately and that isn't okay."

You said you go to the gym? I'd check if they have any exercise classes. Maybe try something you haven't done before, either you'll meet new people who are in the same boat as you, or experienced people who want to help you learn the ropes. 

Other than exercise classes, any sort of class might be good! Check a local community college for any casual lessons going on maybe? Pottery, drawing, sailing...
