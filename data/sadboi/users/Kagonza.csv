Right now would ve the best time since he's not so physically addicted that he would have a difficult withdrawal or dts. Ive been thinking about what I could write and when I should do it.

walmart,fby0bbq,t3_eepwv4,1577205014.0,"I'm service desk/ AT but I've been a cashier and a host so when it gets busy I fill in. I get a lot of customers who want to tell me they refuse to use self check out or that they hate self check out. I've been telling them I'm sure people felt the same way when they started pumping their own gas. Then I get the ones saying I'm saving your job. Well, it's not my job anymore, thank god, and I don't want either. Running the register hurts my shoulders, my back, and my soul from having to bullshit with rude customers non stop!

Then the customers who say can't you open another register. Yeah because I have 10 cashiers sitting on the bench ready to jump on! I wish they would understand/care that I have to code spark people up to the front and then they don't get their work done. Wonder why the store looks like shit and there's nothing on the shelves? Because your lazy ass won't ring up your own shit!

Then there's the disrespect from other associates. I wish I could just stand around all day. The front end just stands around and chats. Why can't someone from self check go push carts they aren't doing anything.  Btw our store makes hosts sell cigarettes at the podium. There's 4 belted and 7 in the bullpen plus selling cigs and they think 1 person can handle it. Why are there so many walkouts? Hmmmmm"
