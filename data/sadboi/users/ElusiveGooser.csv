Do you have any kind of therapy available? Woild you be willing to give that a shot? It has been a slow process for me but I'd still be at the complete rock bottom if I hadn't started therapy.

Wish I had some actual advice for you... I'm kind of on the reverse spectrum.  I misread people a lot, catastrophize, and worry all the time."
getting_over_it,fjdbvek,t1_fjcbh0a,1583250108.0,"Completely get what you're going through.  I've spent so much of my life lost in thought day dreaming and worrying that being present is legit uncomfortable.  I've opened up to my partner and friends, and they're all really supportive. My partner also deals with anxiety and depression, way better than I do, so she knows where I'm coming from.  My most intense anxiety is social and that makes it harder to really talk about it.  I usually have a hard time talking past the basic 'I'm really anxious/mopey today' or 'I just don't really like myself'.  And when I do talk more specifics with them it feels like my train of thought ends up derailing.  Like my brain actually starts overheating.

You're right though! I do need to find a better use for my new headspace than telling myself I'm still doing it wrong."
getting_over_it,fjd8org,t1_fjc52w8,1583248172.0,Have you tried therapy or medication? That's what got me up to this point and will hopefully continue to help.
getting_over_it,fjc14mz,t3_f8dmkb,1583205976.0,A lot of what you're describing is called Cognitive Defusion and Acceptance in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy! Its pretty great stuff.

DestinyTheGame,fhevq1l,t1_fhbsvcl,1581530884.0,This would be heaps better than how it is now.  Even just adding Holliday to the list of NPCs for a new character to meet at the tower would be cool.

Anxiety,eyrc60d,t1_eypha6e,1567364899.0,"I definitely need to work on talking about it more.  I have a good small network of close peeps in my life but my anxiety kind of spikes in social situations, even more with people I care more about. I know they would be kind but Im so worried about bringing them down or something. Finding the words can be tough too once my thoughts start running together."
Anxiety,eyra5wk,t1_eyq2jnq,1567363707.0,"Yeah I have a good group of friends and go to therapy, journal almost daily now, recently started progressive muscle relaxation, and a little bit of mindfulness things to pull me out of my head. 

I'm definitely trying to remind myself that I had it down once and I can get there again.  But it also feels out of my control right now. Like Im stuck at only being able to recognize anxious thoughts and feelkngs but not address them.  I don't even really know what made the flip switch lol."
