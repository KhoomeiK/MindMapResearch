Also after a few days you just start to not think about that time void and naturally fill it up with daily activities or other tasks you have to do. 

I was a heavy stoner for years as well and it’s now been close to 4 months since I’ve smoked. Feelin great, reading more, working out A LOT, hiking, productive reddit-ing. It will come to you!"

2: the second job expects me to start Wednesday so I can only really give a 2 day notice at max. 

This is where the real dilemma is at do I just say something came up and wont be coming in this week. Or go tomorrow to job one and say in person I can no longer come after tomorrow?"

leaves,f6uujvn,t3_dt67a9,1573169052.0,"You need to quit cold turkey otherwise you’re gonna keep doing what your doing. Be tough one day and then go back to cravings. 

I use to work in cannabis so I was a stoner who would take 3 month T-breaks from October to jan. Im currently a bit late this year but I stopped smoking 3 days ago and plan to not smoke for 4-5 months. 

I wait til I finish my 1/8th and then tell myself im no longer buying weed. I throw away all paraphernalia away or hide it somewhere. 

When you get the urge to smoke replace it with something else ( not drugs/ caffeine/ or cigs) go for two min walk, watch something for a few mins, keep your mind off it. 

The first two days you probably will feel like shit and want to smoke to feel better but dont. You will get some chills and other feelings understand they will last only several days. 

Im two days without smoking( and i smoke spliffs only) so im getting the nicotine withdrawal. I slept for 4 hours yesterday and the day before but my body is already adjusting and I can tell by sunday I will be good. After two days of not smoking you forget about it! 

Also get your buddy to stop too. If you stop but hang with friends smoking its no good. Get everyone to stop and encourage each other. 

Be tough and strong but my only suggestion is cold turkey otherwise you wont stop! 

Good luck!"
