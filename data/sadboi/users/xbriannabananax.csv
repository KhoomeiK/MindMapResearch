bipolar2,fh8tv8c,t1_fh8h6o0,1581367265.0,"Thank you, that’s what I try to do.
Dealing with this shit is so hard, I’m hoping it gets better every day..
Someone mentioned how feeling symptomless usually forewarns a manic/hypo period. This has rung true for me, does it for you?"
bipolar2,fh8tkuz,t1_fh8epdq,1581367094.0,"Exactly.
Do you take any meds?"
bipolar2,fh8tjj3,t1_fh8b0o3,1581367071.0,"Thank you.
You’re very right, we’re not okay lol.
I hope your pills are working for you and that you’ve found what works for you.. I hear they can help immensely :)

Have a good day ❤️"
bipolar2,fh8tcvg,t1_fh80e6g,1581366963.0,"Thank you both so much. 
You’re right, I’m realizing that I do get hypo after a symptomless period.. I assume I feel symptomless because being hypomanic is a lot closer to how “normal” people feel than when I’m depressed.

The photo/video idea is also especially great and smart. I’ve been unknowingly documenting with snapchat memories lol. I really wish I didn’t have to deal with this, it’s such a struggle for all of us. But we are all so strong. 

The fact that people even reply, and that these subs exist is just heartwarming to me. Thank you so so much :)

I hope you’re doing alright, hang in there ❤️"
bipolar2,fevnp7o,t3_eq9r39,1579399441.0,"yes!!! ive been saying this. 

i get especially open on social media, and i hate it. coming back down from it is so terrible because i can literally see everything i said while hypo."
bipolar2,fevncug,t3_eqpkgr,1579399301.0,"im also diagnosed with ptsd, and i totally relate to what youre saying.

ive been trying to find stuff on this but havent really been successful. i have no idea if its because of our ptsd, bipolar, anxiety or what. but i do know that it absolutely sucks.

something ive tried to start doing is replace these passing memories with happy ones. like hey, remember when i got breakfast with my grandparents when i was a kid? that was nice. i liked that. i was happy.

good luck, stay strong :)"
bipolar,fd4bhjq,t1_fd1163r,1578166095.0,"Felt that. I reconnect, but it doesn’t seem to matter much if I’m gonna be disconnecting within the next few weeks lol. 
I also rekindle a lot of relationships when I’m manic, but recently I’ve realized how I am socially when manic, and I don’t really like it.. I guess for now I’ll just have to roll the dice

Thank you"
