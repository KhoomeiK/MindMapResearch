depression,erwfbj9,t1_erwdqfg,1561341935.0,Thanks for the advice and support. I’m definitely going to speak with my therapist about it as you mentioned and try to reel it in.
depression,erwf9d9,t1_erwe6qt,1561341884.0,Thanks for sharing. This definitely gives me a little more hope in dealing with it.
BreakUps,eqr4dr1,t3_bz42sh,1560247564.0,"I just had a five year relationship end about a month ago. At first all I saw were my own flaws and the things I could’ve done differently. But after some healing and looking back, my flaws were not the ultimate issue. A relationship is a two way street. You both need to be committed fully to making it work. And although it sucks when one person doesn’t want to put in the effort, it may be a blessing down the road. Keep your head up. I’m in the same boat as you. It’s not easy. Focus on yourself and your own future. Live life to the fullest. Someone is out there who will love you the way you deserve to be loved."

depression,eqh8ib2,t3_bycijd,1560051761.0,"Hey. Idk if this will help. But I am sort of in the same boat as you. I’ve been going to therapy recently, for the first time in my life. The biggest thing we are trying to tackle is my own self hatred. For some reason I can’t stand myself. I look back at certain decisions I’ve made in my life and see them as me fucking up the path of my life. I get it. I understand it. What I’ve been trying to work on is seeing the good that came out of those decisions and appreciating myself for them. You’re not a fuck up. No one is truly a fuck up. Different decisions take us down different paths in life. Try to see the good in the path you are currently taking. There is no right or wrong. There is only continuing forward. 

As for the fuzziness and forgetfulness, that’s just a part of depression. As you fight for yourself and deal with the things you’re going through it will get better. 

Stay strong. Keep your head up. Keep fighting. You’re a survivor!"
rape,epw02if,t3_bw8ihu,1559560524.0,"Yes. It’s a very traumatic experience and you are a victim. Mental issues, depression, anxiety, flashbacks, and nightmares are all going to be a possibility. My advice would be to reach out and get help as soon as possible. Don’t carry that baggage around too long. Get help. Life will get better. Keep your head up.

Wishing you all the best, friend"
mentalhealth,eplmgkw,t3_bv2l61,1559299040.0,I JUST went through this. With the mental health crisis this country has its amazing how there are so few therapists and psychiatrists accepting new patients as well as how many are not in network with insurance companies. It took me almost 3 weeks of diligent searching to finally get in somewhere and they’re not even in network.

loseit,epllsgm,t3_bv26uy,1559298630.0,"This may have already been said but my advice is to always keep pushing. Some days are going to be harder than others but you’ve gotta force yourself to stay in your routine. I would also say don’t put your primary focus on the scale. Focus on yourself. Weight loss will have peaks and valleys and the scale can be very discouraging at times. Focus more on the way you feel, your mental state, the fit of your clothes, and the workouts you’re doing. In time you’ll notice a major difference in yourself that no number on a scale could describe."

BreakUps,eovl5wf,t3_bt9de7,1558896967.0,"I’m dealing with this right now. Dated for 5 years, moved in with her in a different state, took a new job. I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with her. She’s the woman I want to marry and with the blink of an eye it was gone.  It wasn’t until after we had broken up that there was any clarity or explanation. Some of the things we had spoken about before but others I had no clue. It makes it that much more difficult. Everyday is a struggle."
depression,eope5ou,t3_bsqjbg,1558761605.0,Experience life. Experience happiness. It’s not always all bad. You said in another post you were playing through Red Dead 2. Start there. It’s something you enjoy. So do it and enjoy it. That in itself is a step towards self care.
depression,eopcpnj,t3_bsqjbg,1558760491.0,You’re right it’s not a guarantee. But it IS a possibility. There’s also no guarantee you’ll feel the way you do right now forever. The only way you know is to take the time and experience it. Give it a chance. Give yourself a chance.
depression,eopbl4y,t1_eopb3xs,1558759642.0,"It’s hard. I’ve been there. I understand. What I can tell you from my own experiences is that it truly does get better. Start small. Go for a run. Pick up a book. Watch a movie. Do something you enjoy. It’s seems like nothing but it isn’t. As menial as doing a small task like that is, it’s a step towards self care. It’s a step towards healing.  Dealing with depression is a long and strenuous journey. I don’t know your entire situation but there are people who are here for you. It may be family. It may be friends. It may be you coming on to reddit to vent. We’re here. Many of us have lived through what you’re going through and we’ve overcome. I have no doubt in my mind that you can too."
depression,eopacx8,t3_bsqjbg,1558758725.0,"I feel for you. There is always a light at the end of the tunnel. You may not see it now but it’s there. Keep your chin up. Keep working to improve yourself. Things will get better in time. 

I was once in a similar boat. Honestly, quite often now, I still feel the same way. Try to take a step back and enjoy the little things. Breathe in fresh air. Look at the stars. Feel the breeze. This world is so much greater than we could ever imagine. It has so much to off to us. It has so much to offer to YOU.

One step at a time. One day at a time. You can overcome this!"
depression,eop97z9,t3_bsqd80,1558757903.0,"You don’t want to do this. I’ve been in your shoes before. A loner. I dropped out of college. I was dealing with a whole bunch of other shit in my life.  It gets better. Things change. Each step forward is progress no matter how small. I would recommend looking into therapy and turning to family for help. Even turning to people here on reddit. Vent. Let them know how you feel and why. There are many avenues for improvement. Start small. When I was struggling and at my lowest point I searched for things that helped me to relieve my mind. I started working out, reading, meditating and I started a journal. Try to look for and find something that will make you comfortable. And go from there. 

One step at a time. One day at a time. You can overcome this"
offmychest,eop6xmn,t3_bsq7ht,1558756281.0,"Loneliness is a feeling felt by many. Oh so often am I surrounded by colleagues, friends and family but I still feel lonely too. Things do get better. They will for you. 

As for your friends not wanting to speak to you? If that’s the case I would look for some new ones.

Head out to the bar. Pick up a new hobby that can be done in public (kayaking, going to the gym ,volunteering) and meet new people. Broaden your circle and let new people into your life. It is harder said than done but seeing results will make you feel better! 

I was/am in the same boat as you. It’s not easy at all, but looking back at certain steps I’ve taken, seeing even the smallest results has given me some comfort.

Keep your chin up!"
relationship_advice,eop3wu0,t3_bsptgx,1558754236.0,"I mean.... it all depends on the person I guess. Even yourself. You shouldn’t be forcing yourself to speak More or to stay quiet. There is a balance that needs to be had but that balance needs to be something you’re comfortable with. You should just worry about being yourself and let that shine through above all else. 

In regards to what your ex said I would heed their words but also understand you are who you are. Personally, clingy isn’t an issue I’d worry about. It’s jealousy that can damage relationships the most. I’ve ruined a few relationships with my own jealousy. Being jealous is okay. Letting jealousy come out in the form of being controlling or angry is not."
BreakUps,eoow0mb,t3_bsgp26,1558749125.0,"I feel for you so deeply. I just got out of a long relationship with the woman I saw myself spending eternity with. It’s only been a couple of weeks but I dread what you’re feeling and understand it is probably coming sooner rather than later. For me, especially with the pain and wounds from it coming so recently, the thing that gives me some semblance of comfort is hope. Hope I’ll  find someone else. Hope I’ll end up back together with her eventually. Hope I’ll be okay. That’s what I’ve tried to take out of my own situation. I’ve found that reading into all of the negatives, if you look hard enough, you can find hope in every aspect. For you, it’s hope someone realizes what they lost. It’s hope you’ll find someone that will treat you the way you deserve to be treated. It’s hope that you will come out of this a better and stronger individual. Keep your head up. Keep on moving. Keep hoping. Good things and people are coming your way."
rapecounseling,eooeo4o,t3_bse2jf,1558736681.0,"Each situation is different. For myself, 17 years after the fact, only 5 people know my story and 2 of those people are my parents. You need to do it when the time is right for you above all else. There is no need for you to rush into it if you are not ready or comfortable telling them yet. Take your time. Make sure the time is right for you. Then just be honest. 

It’s not much, but I hope this helped at least a little."
