Hang in there. Everything will be fine. Good luck!"
SkincareAddiction,fktqbyn,t3_fknui5,1584531018.0,I don't think you should be using it in the morning because it makes your skin more sensitive to UVA and UVB ray. Plus you should be wesring sunscreen even if you are not getting direct sun exposure.
NatureIsFuckingLit,fkpatwf,t1_fkp87pr,1584405743.0,Get ready for the poop Apocalypse! :P

islam,fklk93j,t3_fj0e5g,1584308262.0,This is definitely something I've been struggling with. I'm trying to find my way back to Allah and be a better muslim. Sometimes self forgiveness is also important and letting go of guilt.
Anxiety,fklax78,t1_fkk01zq,1584302328.0,I literally feel that. I'm so annoyed at myself for letting my thoughts take control of my life in such a drastic way. That is great advice. I Will try and do the same. Thank you so much and I'm really happy that you were able to get out of it and find a job! It gives me hope for myself :)
Anxiety,fklalda,t1_fkjo0h8,1584302119.0,Yes I have been thinking about volunteering. I will definitely look and see what is available for me. Thank you so much for your advice.
Anxiety,fklad7w,t1_fkj54n8,1584301978.0,Aww! I hope you don't have to go through what I'm going through. I would advise you that as soon as you graduate start applying because as time goes by it gets harder. Which is the position I'm in and I wouldn't wish anyone to feel this way. Good luck and congrats in advance for graduating!
Anxiety,fkla2hu,t1_fkirgoz,1584301791.0,Yes I have been to those workshops and they have helped tremendously. But when it comes to actually applying I start to get scared and overwhelmed.
Anxiety,fkl9thu,t1_fkj182f,1584301633.0,"Thank you for sharing your experience with me. I live in Canada so I understand what you mean. That is something I definitely pride myself of, the fact that no matter what I'm doing,  I do it to the best of my abilities. I can't do anything half-assed. 
But yes, I definitely need to work on my communication skills because I tend to go into a state of panic and my mind basically goes blank. 
Thank you so so much for your advice! I truly appreciate it and will definitely apply it in this process."
Anxiety,fkl93h9,t1_fkimdqo,1584301176.0,"My resume is ok. I have been to a few workshops and they have helped me improve my resume and get tips on the interview process. I think what I need is to go through a few interviews because I start to panic when I'm asked questions and essentially my brain goes blank. 
I also feel as though I have a lot more issues other than applying for a job. Like I mentioned in my post, i have general anxiety. So my mind os constantly in overdrive where it's basically thinking of everything that can go wrong even after I get a job. 
But I Will continue to reach out as you mentioned. Thank you so much for your advice. Means a lot to me!"
Anxiety,fkl8l20,t1_fkjoxga,1584300853.0,I know what you mean. I wish there were better tools available for those of us struggling with job anxiety.
Anxiety,fkl8cs7,t1_fkinc9a,1584300711.0,"Omg thank you so much! I will definitely dm when I get a chance to get on my computer, since my resume is on a USB drive. 
Thank you so much for reaching out! I am so appreciative!"
Anxiety,fkl824m,t1_fkillbj,1584300526.0,"Yeah that's very true. Along with other people, I also have high expectations of myself which is also another reason for why this process feels so overwhelming. I honestly for the longest time have been thinking of getting a minimum wage job just for the sake of experience and having something to do rather than overthinking my life. I appreciate your advice and good luck to you too! I hope you end up in a poisition in life that makes you happy! :)"
Anxiety,fkl7itx,t1_fkihzla,1584300190.0,"You are right about that. In my heart I know that I'm a capable person, but my thoughts always tend to find a way of putting me down. It's like some days I wake up feeling so motivated and than the next it's like I literally can't do anything. Thank you so much for your kind words and encouragement. I will definitely try to apply wherever I can and try not to overthink. Thank you again so much!"
SkincareAddiction,fizwkwf,t3_fargmr,1582877820.0,"Try focusing on gentle cleansing and moisturizing the skin. Stop using any actives or anything that will exfoliate the skin. After you wash your face and your skin is still slightly damp, apply your moisturizer. Also, if you can get your hands on something like la roche posay cicaplast balm it mignt help."
SkincareAddiction,fh5w4pm,t3_f1gxvh,1581292820.0,The Ordinary moisturizer is great. Not sure what skin type you have but for my dry skin it feels non greasy and is really affordable!
SkincareAddiction,f8b7uei,t3_dzypog,1574429775.0,La roche posay cicaplast baume. Also try moisturizing on slightly damp skin rather than drying it.
SkincareAddiction,f80dfm4,t3_dyc942,1574126388.0,"Benzagel has a wash and cream that are pretty good and available in most pharmacy's. Neutrogema rapid  clear also has bp wash, spot treatment and mask. You can use bp wash or even gel as contact therapy and they will be effective."
SkincareAddiction,f7a72m7,t1_f7a6tgt,1573522071.0,I think it has a similar feel to cerave. They also have a cream version that might be lighter.
SkincareAddiction,f7a6ary,t3_dv24t7,1573521500.0,Maybe try Bioderma Atoderm Baume and it helps if you put moisturizer on slightly damp skin.
SkincareAddiction,f79cyt0,t1_f79buls,1573505798.0,Maybe try spacing the days out for when you use actives. Maybe your skin needs a break in between. So use the retinol one day than focus on hydration the next and than lactic acid the next day and than hydration again and repeat. Or just use each once a week spaced out. Or is the product itself the problem? Maybe you can try something else.
SkincareAddiction,f79b8bh,t3_duy76j,1573505120.0,DO you use the actives first on dry skin? I also sufferfrom eczema and I think it usually flares up from dryness and obviously other things like allergic reactions. I feel like when it comes to skincare my eczema flares up when my skin is on the drier side. Maybe layer them with hydrating products? Like the lactic acid can be mixed in with moisturizer maybe?
SkincareAddiction,f61ttcd,t3_dq5fwa,1572646886.0,I've been using biacna on and off  because I started getting CC's but I'm not sure if that was the cause or something else I was using. Did you experience a purge? Did you begin slowly adding it into your routine or did you just use it every day? Congrats on your results. You look so radiant and happy! :)
Anxiety,f5zpeoa,t3_dplj06,1572582946.0,Currently in the same situation and I don't know what to do.I'm even scared to apply. I really hope it gets better for you. One step at a time. :)
longhair,f4wb5v0,t3_debtjz,1571853917.0,Omg your hair looks amazing! I have fine straight hair too. If you don't mind me asking is there any tips you can give? And what shampoo do you use? My hair has been feeling really dry and brittle lately . :(

canada,ezqkc89,t3_d11knb,1568060400.0,Thanks for the help and suggestions everyone. Ended up booking a 4 day bus tour from tours4fun so it all worked out.
canada,ezgs1kh,t1_ezghsim,1567900734.0,Lmao I swear! This is the one thing about travelling I hate so much. Figuring things out and planning. I'm so stresssed!
canada,ezgb82c,t1_ezg8fpi,1567894401.0,We haven't booked our flights yet as we are still deciding what to do . But yes I will definitley look into it. Thank you for your advice.
canada,ezgavde,t1_ezg5fax,1567894256.0,Yup it definitely would be an adventure. Renting a car was our initial thought as well but was wondering if their were other options available. Going for roughly 10 days.
canada,ezgal74,t1_ezg9sx6,1567894130.0,Oh okay. Thought about renting a car as well but wanted to know if their were other options available. Thanks!
canada,ezg33tg,t1_ezg2onc,1567890301.0,Lol I Know. But are there ways of getting there by bus or train that's affordable.
depression,exadcnk,t3_crx3gz,1566105089.0,"Hey, I totally understanding what you are feelng right now. That feeling of things falling apart is the most shitiest feeling in the world. But things are still fresh right now, so it will take time to adjust and accept everything. Please don't be so hard on yourself. It's times like these where you need to push yourself even though you're totally mentally exhauted. Cry, scream,  do whatever it takes to let it all out but than give yourself some tougn love. When it feels like everything is falling that is when you start rebuilding. YOU WILL GET THROUGH THIS!  I wish you the best of luck! <3"
AskReddit,ex6xbyg,t3_crgd6g,1566052927.0,Sometimes I randomly wake up in the middle of the night and my body feels like it's vibrating.

depression,ewa9w1c,t3_cng1o3,1565239326.0,When you're literally exhausted and want to sleep but you're thoughts won't let you. It's the worst! :(
depression,ewa96hl,t3_cd6d58,1565238931.0,ALL THE DAMN TIME! It's the most frustrating and mentally exhausting thing.
depression,ew9woj8,t1_ew9se8r,1565232414.0,"Yeah I definitely agree that blaming our selves and feeling out of control is the cause of many people's demise But I don't want people to feel like that is the answer to their problems. Trust me, I've been through the whole self-harm and suicidal faze and it's not the answer. So a little bit of background story, my mom is extremely strict and very old schooled I guess. She wanted me to become a doctor since I was little and I got it drilled in my head that it was what I wanted as well. As I grew older and entered uni, I very quickly realized that it wasn't what I wanted. Psychology was never something I wanted to do, but amongst a mid-life crisis and feeling lost I stuck with it. TBH I would sit in class and feel very triggered by the things I was learning. I felt like a statistic. Like learning about people who come from broken homes and the mental health issues they face or sexual assault victims and the issues they face. I felt like shit learning these things because I felt like I was dealing with the  outcomes of those situations if that makes sense. So I don't know if I can mentally deal with mental illness related things on a day to day basis when mine is already fragile. I'm an EXTREMELY empathetic person. I'm very emotional and I make other people's problems my problems. So I don't know what to do about that."
depression,ew9fvss,t1_ew9edb4,1565224657.0,"Yeah, I definitely agree with you. I need to start taking actions and steps forward, But my thoughts and feelings just take over sometimes and it is the most shittiest feeling in the world.  I feel like only person in the way of my happiness is me because I do this to myself but I can't help it. My days are pretty unproductive to be honest. Just at home watching YouTube and TV shows, I stopped using social media all together a long time ago because it made me more depressed. I started to go for runs every evening so that's good I guess. I need to start looking for work but I don't know what I wanna do and I'm scared to get stuck in a job I don't like."
depression,ew9diam,t1_ew9c87d,1565223568.0,"Yeah it just sucks, because I feel like I envisioned a life for myself that I thought was attainable despite all the hardship. But nothing has been making sense. But also, I try to stay positive and think that life is so unexpected and it just might turn around. So you never know, you just might get the internship. I hope it works out for you!"
Ulta,esemtkw,t1_esemgyn,1561903974.0,Aww okay. Thank you so much for letting me know!
