LifeProTips,fb4b7ht,t3_ebaie3,1576505513.0,This reminds me of my former friend who lent about 5000 (and this came from a woman who always struggled financially to pay her bills and feed her 2 kids) to this man who she had started talking to only a FEW MONTHS AGO. Her justification? He was actually an old friend from loooooooooooong ago and trusts him. But they never kept in contact. They only recently started talking and although he says he will pay her back he already has asked her two more times for more money??? For what you might ask? The first time for a lawyer to settle a dispute over a ticket he got. The second time for lunch at work because he didn't want to go home for lunch. The second time to bail him out of jail when he failed. The balls this man had to keep asking for money blows my mind as well as my former friends stupidity.

She strung him along by not telling him she wasn't interested. She liked the chase though. Him and I began messaging each other mostly about her and he would tell me how much he was into her and whatever. Eventually he got over her when he realized he wasn't going to get anywhere with her and here we are. I generally don't like telling others how we met though, it makes me feel like I was the second option and may make others think the same."
