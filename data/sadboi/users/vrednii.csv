Stoicism,fr3gc6k,t3_gmdrk5,1589856817.0,"I am very sorry for your losses; first in losing him and second for not being able to share your grief with family through the service.

When we are hungry, we eat.  When we are thirsty, we drink.  When we are tired, we sleep.  When we are in grief, we mourn.

It is natural.  Let it flow through you.  Do not try to block or ignore it, nor fan or aggrandize it. The keen pain and grief that you are feeling will blunt with time.

Remember all that you learned from him, and continue to grow."

I can‚Äôt feel your pain, but I understand it, and I know that it must be intense and prolonged for you to contemplate this.  It is my hope that you will see through this and become a survivor.  You could easily be the reason that someone‚Äôs life is better."
SuicideWatch,febchqs,t3_eo9o49,1578957470.0,"Your pain and fear run very deep.  It‚Äôs unfair that someone so talented and young must endure what you are facing.  I can feel your agony through your words.

I think that everybody in this subreddit would dog-pile you with hugs, just so you could have the experience of knowing that we care.  We want you to be pain free, and we want to wipe away your fears.  We want you to be able to stand on your feet and face the world with unflinching confidence, assured that, even if you stumble, we‚Äôve got you.

Please, see what everybody here is writing to you.  We all are dealing with pains and fears.  It‚Äôs not a contest, there are no comparisons; everybody travels their own path.  But, together, we can help each other navigate the insurmountable parts; we can advise, we can encourage, we can commiserate.  And, yes, when I say, ‚Äúwe,‚Äù I include you.  You have experience, and your voice could save someone‚Äôs life.

Please, take a breath.   Then take another.  Hug your cat and feel his purr.  Let your dolls know that you will add to their numbers.  And, lift your voice ‚Äî sing, share what‚Äôs in your heart.  Do it for you.  If only 1 person in a thousand likes your songs, that‚Äôs still 8 million people in this world who would be your fans.

I would like the opportunity to get to know you better, and I think others here would, too.  And, maybe, together, we can all find the best path to overcoming the darkness.

I hope to see another post from you after midnight."
