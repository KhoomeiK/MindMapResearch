AmItheAsshole,fpg1hvg,t1_fpg1avb,1588591276.0,"I'm not going to act on anything, but it's been playing on my mind and where better to get clarity than a few brutal reddit comments. Isolation is taxing for the mental health, sometimes you need a sounding board."
AmItheAsshole,fpg1can,t1_fpg0vpa,1588591126.0,"This is true and I have thought of that, even before lockdown we were struggling numbers when we were usually packed, obviously I came to the wrong place to ask this and the hyenas of reddit have put me in my place."
AmItheAsshole,fpg0hex,t1_fpg0ex8,1588590295.0,"The pub is irrelevant, it was more pointing out how I didn't have a large amount of money, as some people on here have assumed Im priveledged and weathly I am far from."
AmItheAsshole,fpg0eps,t1_fpg099i,1588590222.0,"So if hypothetically if this plunges into the worse enomical situation we've ever seen, everybody loses the jobs, homes and the global economy colaspes, what then? There are other options other countries have tried and successfully used social distancing and other protocols."
AmItheAsshole,fpg09m9,t1_fpg02pf,1588590081.0,It seems overly extreme to say everybody will die from corona and sounds like the fear mongering. Rather than stating actual facts and figures about mortality rates.
AmItheAsshole,fpfzvnl,t1_fpfzqfk,1588589687.0,"It's not so much a concern about money but survival, I worked two jobs because I wasn't paid much. At this current time I can afford one meal a day and things aren't improving. I worked hard to be able to put food in my table, maybe go to the pub twice a week. But then to have it all fall apart around you from no doing of your own. I think it's understable to be upset?"
AmItheAsshole,fpfzlwy,t1_fpfzkqi,1588589411.0,Oh apologies I wasn't aware.
AskReddit,ffyn9r0,t3_evqtcc,1580350468.0,"I work in sales, and have to be bright and bubbly all the time, smiles, enthusiasm, all that shit. But in my personal life I have depression and bipolar but I hide it from everyone (except reddit that's my outlet). The person who's secretly unhappy is the person with the biggest smile, and the act never drops. Some people can be extremely high functioning despite what's happening in their head, not always easy to spot the problem till its to late. If you suspect someone is unhappy, maybe just speak to them and offer an place to talk confidently about it. People afraid to reach out."
AmItheAsshole,fc34mwx,t1_fc30bx1,1577381313.0,"I wouldn't say I was overbearing, I never multi text or harass. For instance the other day she text me asking to make plans, they were made, everything fine. Then the day came I text her asking if we are still meeting at agreed time, no response, the agreed time came and I admit I text ""guess not then"" not very mature but I was annoyed as had turned down other plans. I got a response saying I was being a pest, but I don't feel I was being pesty to ask about the plans we'd made at her request. Judging from the responses I'm getting I'm certainly not in the right but I feel I'm not in the wrong either. I think I'll take your advice and distance as much as I can."
AmItheAsshole,fc33g4a,t1_fc30znf,1577380537.0,"Any advice on ways to do this? I've never been in this position before, and worried I'm handling it poorly."
AmItheAsshole,fc331qm,t1_fc31pbi,1577380279.0,"I guess your right, I guess I've struggled with it as in every other aspect of my life I don't get doormatted, and have never been in the position of being the chaser. (not a brag, just never been that kind of guy that chases girls, usually pretty independent). Maybe sometimes you just need a stranger on reddit to set you straight haha"
AmItheAsshole,fc31bhy,t1_fc30w3i,1577379194.0,"I never made the contact when she moved back, I had no idea she was back until she asked me to meet. If I'm honest I had been hung up on her since she'd left but now Im worried she took advantage of that when she came back and I got the wrong idea."
AmItheAsshole,fc31587,t1_fc305xa,1577379085.0,"I understand this, but what's happening is she will be talking to me, saying all sorts of things about wanting to see me etc. Literally other day she text me asking to make plans, we made some then I heard nothing from her, text her on the day and she got mad saying I pestering her. Literally hadn't text her a single time between making the plans and the day it was meant to happen. All I was trying to do was see if the plans she'd asked for was still on. Surely that's not unreasonable? But you are right she doesn't owe me anything I guess and maybe just shouldn't let myself get involved"
mentalhealth,fc14fjz,t3_eflhq5,1577307964.0,"Ive felt the same since as long as I can remember, no matter what I do never seem to fit in with most people, have very few friends, and have always blamed it on being something wrong with me, because everybody was around me seemed normal and popular. But you ofter find they feel the same In there own way, the majority of people do operate in different ways to yourself. Why it's so electric when you find people who are on the same wave length as yourself, and you will if you look hard enough. Suicide doesn't just stop the pain, it stops everything, keep pushing, stay safe. The new decade could be full of possibilities, don't lose that. Happy holidays"
mentalhealth,fc11z6x,t1_fc0zswq,1577305962.0,"Thank you for this, I've saved the list to my phone and going to try and use these techniques to keep myself centered. Hanging in best I can, it's about to be the start of a new dexade who knows what it might bring"
mentalhealth,fc0r1y9,t3_efj8la,1577297555.0,"Depression can feel like it's sucked the personality out of you. I've been dealing with depression for a long time, I had a phase were it passed when I met my ex fiancee, I started going to the gym, making new friends and became. Outgoing again and got a hold of my substance abuse. Then we split, was messy, I relapsed back into drug use and my depression, now this year I've lost my dog, my house and my friends. It's going to be a long road to recovery again, and like you anyone I approach for help views me as weak or just not putting in the effort to be happy..but atleast now I know it's possible to come out of it and get better, your never alone, and it's never over till its over, you just have to push to be the person you want, and look for like minded people to support you, they maybe hard to find but they are out there I promise. Stay safe these holidays."
mentalhealth,fc0lkrf,t1_fc0kejv,1577293845.0,"I can't wait for the holidays to be done, it feels selfish as everyone else is so happy. Im doing the same with trying to stay sober.. Ive reached out to a couple of people but don't want to bring anyone else down on a day like today. So I guess it's soildering on through and trying to stay strong. I hope you are able to feel better by the time the holidays pass too!"
mentalhealth,fc0l7yu,t3_efety4,1577293558.0,"Holidays always make it seem like your the only one who feels this way, then you come on reddit and realise there's a whole world of people in the same place today. I hope everybody finds some peace and happiness over the holidays."
