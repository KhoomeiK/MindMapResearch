I am seriously fustrated by these effects because I struggle to remember things even doing with my wife and our children. I struggle to remember many things about our relationship as well.

It has made so many things more difficult in our marriage especially when I cannot recall important details of our relationship from when we met to other important events from our 2-year relationship.

The centre said that MAT programs are not closed atleast according to them and that they may be able to waive the supervised dosage for the COVID-19 period of measures so let me take-home right away and reduce to having to fill the prescription twice a week instead.

I think the pharmacy was concerned because my wife is giving birth tomorrow so they didn't want me going daily to the pharmacy with a newborn in the house.

The doctors made it clear that she shouldn't stop taking it for her own sale but also because the withdrawal is very mild for the child. She cuts them into halves(10mg) instead of the whole 20mg(lowest dose.)

Obviously these are completly different chemicals, but I thought I would share. Remember that withdrawal can be managed by the hospital. I can't imagine how it feels for a baby but do your best for your child. Your doctor knows more than I do so follow what they tell you.

OpiatesRecovery,fkcfe47,t1_fkbyj58,1584051925.0,"Thank you for encouraging me in this endeavour. I appreciate hearing from someone else who has been doing MAT. I am still on a waiting list for atleast a couple more weeks just waiting on the phone call to begin the process.

The only thing which made me a little sad is learning that I will have to walk to the pharmacy at the same time each and every day to get/take my dose infront of a pharmacist. I completly understand that this is a precaution to protect myself as an addict who might abuse the prescription if I was allowed to take it home with me. It is just an inconvience despite the walk only being about 10 minutes each way....

The problem is I often find it difficult to even leave the house for a walk or on my own, but obviously I would want to follow the program to the letter. I was told that after about 3 months I would have a less restrictive process for this Suboxone. 

Of course I was under a different impression based on my own research which I conducted. I was under the impression that with Suboxone I would not need to go to the pharmacy each day like I heard people do when using Methadone(going to a special clinic each day.) I was under this impression that because of how different Suboxone is I would be allowed to administer this at home myself.

It's a bit of a let-down that I will have to operate just like people taking Methadone have to...but whatever it takes to return to a sober lifestyle I will do."

OpiatesRecovery,fia1zxa,t1_fi9o5qh,1582290792.0,"I think this is a very accurate statement. Obviously there are things which can effect life expectancy. If you are shooting up it can certainly cause damage to veins, cause infections,etc. If you're not eating well and taking good care of your body because of the ""lifestyle"" then yes it can cause lasting damage, but it's possibly the body heals too.

I am not a doctor I just know how self-healing the human body is. I would say that not living ""that lifestyle"" as mentioned above would certainly negate most of the long-term damage.

I would say the most long-lasting damage could be to your brain itself. The hormonal levels of dopamine and serotonin that kind of thing.

Lastly, I do remember hearing(researching actually haha) that opiates can have an effect on peoples immune response/system and create a higher risk of catching something nasty and having it ravage your Boyd. Personally, I seem to have always had a great immune response ever since I was young. I literally only get dope sick but no other sicknesses.

Just be smart I think is the best advice, and stop using if you can. That's the only way to make sure you're not doing lasting damage. My wife has told me she doesn't want to loose me even though I don't see my habit as something that could even kill me since I don't shoot up, I never go higher than like 20-30mg per day, etc, etc

But now I am starting to get off the stuff because 1) I am tired of it atleast part of me and 2) I see the pain in my wife's eyes and I realized that even if I don't see a problem with my usage...it's making pain for her so it doesn't really matter how I feel...does it? It's hurting someone else. Big step to draw that conclusion.

sex,feoe3z0,t1_fei8obe,1579298870.0,"Thanks for letting me know about this ""healing can take around a year."" I certainly felt like it took me a couple of months after I found out the first time. SHe would get awfully mad at me shortly after I discovered the messages between her and this man. She got mad because for the first while after I found out about the cheating I would essentially call her a slut and bring up the fact that she cheated with this man and that I had walked in once and heard them going at it and hearing her obviously having the ride of her life. It was unbelievably painful to both hear her calling out his name and seemingly having the best sex she's ever also knowing that he's ALOT bigger than me from the photo I saw him send to her.

&#x200B;

The truth is that I have moved passed the cheating which happened back about a year ago. The problem I am suffering from now is the revelation she has made that her and him only ""broke it off - whatever she meant...I guess that she was formally dating him because she was ""afraid to raise the baby alone...?

I am currently struggling with the fact that she seems to have been sexually active with him again during this ""forced separation."" She has been telling me that she is completely done with him especially because he refused to settle down to be exclusive with her. Why I am havign trouble restablishing trust this time is because she has kept him as a friend on Facebook and I have seen her messsage list include his name AND because her best friend seemed like she was flriting with this guy and it BOTHERS HER SO MUCH. She brings up how she really doesn't want her best friend flirting with this guy and she gets upset when this guy flirts with ANYONE ELSE.

&#x200B;

I swear at times she sounds like she is madly in-love with this man. Those times that she hears or comments about this guy flirting with or sleeping with someone else and how she is frustrated by that....it just hurts me so, so much to see her get so upset over whatever this man is doing when she claim to LOVE ME MORE THAN ANYONE AND THAT I AM THE ONE AND ONLY...her actions aren't matching her words and I am hurting so much because I know that likely no matter what she does I won't ever leave her because I love her so god damn much.... SIGH"
sex,feiit3l,t1_feifsnb,1579139510.0,"I agree with you in regards to the first time that she cheated on me in our relationship. The more recent events between them which I have only heard about tonight as well as hearing that she ""broke it off with him last week."" At the ment the two of us are ""officially single"" which means that while we love each other and want to be together as well as discussing marriage in the past.....we are not allowed to see each other/be together in our relationship because of government intervention.

This means while I told her despite this ""forced break-up"" that I would choose to remain faithful because of my confidence that once we clear up this completly mental situation keeping us apart from each other. She never verbally stated that she would remain faithful without falling into a relationship or sexual encounters with me. She stated that during this seperation period she would find it difficult to not to sleep with someone if we cannot sleep with each other considering that this situation could take a couple of years to deal with.

As I said she never told me that she would remain faithful using her words in the beginning. She has changed her tune and has returned to having sex with me and seeing each other in secret to prevent making our situation worse for everyone involved. I certainly had hoped she would remain faithful and to simply let her desire for sex to take a backseat atleast for a couple of months while I see how I can tackle our situation.

She ensures me that the sexual activity between the two of them has stopped. She promises that she ""broke things off"" with him as of last week and choose to work on whatever it is we can have between us with this situation still on-going.

 I cannot say that I trust her completly after thinking back to all of those times in which I found out what was going on with her and this guy from our church. He even went as far as to tell her, ""that he wanted to be with her and to raise the baby as my own child. That there is no need to return to the father of the baby when he clearly cannot give you what it is you're looking for. But I cannot stop sleeping with other women, so if that's not something you're down for its over between us.""

I really don't like this guy and the way that he speaks with my girlfriend. I remember one of the messages that I had found between them a year ago read something like, ""I don't mind cucking MY NAME. I will treat you like the queen you are and give you everything you deserve and certainly more than MY NAME the cuck.""

😠"
sex,feieyaw,t1_fei6mx3,1579136945.0,"I cannot disagree with you. We had what I thought at the time was a candid conversation between both of us. I had comfronted her about the cheating once I was made privy to the details. In that conversation she expressed believes she is suffering from an ""addiction to sex"" and that is why she has made some poor decisions throughout our relationship.

I took that at face value and asked for her to look for some sort of support group or a doctor who could give her the help she needs to overcome her, ""sex addiction."" I don't think she ever did seek any form of support for this addiction which she claims to suffer from. The only assurances I got were from her when she would tell me that she was no longer experiencing the effects of her sexual addiction and the fact that she is madly in love with me and sees me as ""being the one for her.""

sex,fei92fi,t1_fei6dx3,1579133009.0,I suppose you could be right with your statement. I know for certain that these have been the only times where she has cheated on me and it has never happened with anyone else. In all cases where cheating was involved those moments were spent with the same man.
sex,fei8ugo,t1_fei63jo,1579132864.0,Yes because we already had genetic testing done due to some potential problems after our child is born.
sex,fei8pme,t1_fei663z,1579132778.0,"That's what I was afraid of hearing because I have developed serious feelings for this women. I honestly thought that she was the women who would lift me out of the crator which has been left by the cheating of every other women I went out with.

I have been very excited to be having our first biological child together and for this to be the last one for the both of us. I was perfectly fine with having two biological children that I produced during my lifetime.

It's going to be so difficult on our child and I if I have to choose to walk away....so sad indeed."
sex,fei8gj8,t1_fei5xrd,1579132617.0,I will certainly browse that book if I am able to find a digital copy of the book in e-book format. Thank you for sharing something that I can reference in my spare time!
sex,fei670j,t1_fei6248,1579131167.0,No it is definitely my kid. We had genetic testing done among other medical tests because my firstborn son has had a slew of developmental delays. The child is 100% mine.
sex,fei60ov,t3_ep440j,1579131054.0,"I honestly have LOVED when my girlfriend has gone down on me while I was playing games. It hasn't happened that many times since I haven't been playing video games as often lately, but she's a master of giving AMAZING blow jobs everytime that she goes for it.

I honestly think that she is the first women who manages to make me finish in her mouth while she's going down on me. Gosh, I really love this women haha..."

opiates,fdp6z9a,t1_fdp46tr,1578621457.0,Yeah I have no idea why they started doing that. Google is awfully evil these days though.
opiates,fdo4oqp,t3_emem7n,1578598848.0,Google is indeed censoring drug-related content. Fuck google use DuckDuckGo as their also provacy-focused.
OpiatesRecovery,fdln7nq,t3_em14jd,1578527848.0,Good job! I just hit 2 weeks and I .already filled with energy again which is wonderful! I can't imagine what 6months will feel like.
OpiatesRecovery,fdilfsn,t3_elka2r,1578445527.0,"Goodluck on your journey fellow Canadian. I hope things work out great for you and that your videos can serve as a warning and education,especially for the next generation coming up."

OpiatesRecovery,fdhrtkj,t3_elar0h,1578428937.0,"Today is actually going okay. I'm on day like 11 or 12. I stopped counting mostly. I am a bit more tired today, can anyone confirm whether it's normal that I might have a dip in energy after quite a few days or feeling very energetic?.

I figure it's just normal ups and downs people have if they aren't recovering but hey. Hope everyone else is reaching their goals!"
OpiatesRecovery,fdh3quf,t1_fdh2s4c,1578414733.0,"Yeah, no. I have never been that awful with alcohol. I have never once been physically dependant on alchohol. I might have had some trouble with it when I was a teenager/young adult running around moving weight and taking care of business, sure.

I was more interested in the depletion so that if I did get pissed on the rare occasion if it would deplete certain things and whatnot."
OpiatesRecovery,fdf6gyi,t1_fde6krl,1578354406.0,"Thanks for the reply. I don't plan on ever drinking too heavy. It's usually sharing a six-pack why a buddy of mine, or enough liquor to get tipsy but not pissed."
OpiatesRecovery,fde4xcs,t1_fde4rj9,1578331263.0,"Learn from your failures and improve. Think what caused your relapse, people,places,shows,movies,whatever it might be. You only fail when you fail to learn and reapply what you've learned. :)"

OpiatesRecovery,fdbcl68,t1_fdb6hs3,1578256026.0,"Interesting. I shouldn't need something like that since I am past acute withdrawal but it's interesting to say the least. I'm always fascinated by things like medical advances or new technologies.

Thanks for sharing."
OpiatesRecovery,fda20d9,t1_fd9jzqy,1578240776.0,"I basically do the same thing everyday on basically the same schedule. It's boring as fuck at times trying to derive pleasure from things. But now each day I feel a tiny bit better so it's motivating. The fist week is shear hell and I can understand why we tend to give back into the drug.

I am just happy to be free even if I'm not exactly ""happy"" per se."
OpiatesRecovery,fd9ioda,t3_ekamxn,1578233937.0,Congratulations on making it this far. I am also on day 9 and this morning I woke up with more energy than I have had for almost two weeks. I will likely dip in energy once I am awake for around 4hours but hey it is better than being high!
OpiatesRecovery,fd5shuq,t1_fd5c1bu,1578180998.0,Oh I plan to stick with it. It's interesting to FEEL again and not be constantly out of it. Sure I hate not being high at times but I have to remember all of the false promises opiates made with me.
OpiatesRecovery,fd5rlm2,t3_eji6ob,1578180703.0,"I am sitting here on day 8. To be honest almost all the symptoms are gone, except once the evening rolls around I totally begin feeling hit and sort of sickly. I don't really understand why but hey.

This is the longest I have had for a long time. I took a 30minute walk today, watched some TV, saw my parents, and think I am gonna play some video games for a change this evening :)

I can't wait to feel 100% and get truly free from these chains."
OpiatesRecovery,fd5ar10,t1_fd5aja0,1578175807.0,Okay thank you. I really am glad to be making it further than I ever have before. I imagine I'll be even better when I hit 2 weeks and more.
OpiatesRecovery,fd44j1m,t1_fd443p1,1578164372.0,"I've felt better. Still fairly fatigued during the day. My goosebumps/chills were already on their way out and/or at random intervals.

I've heard that withdrawals don't often come back with the same intensity if one accidently it purposely takes a significantly smaller dose than they're used to."
OpiatesRecovery,fcu0k14,t3_ehb1lj,1577968338.0,"How are you doing now? I am on day 6 and i know what youeam about relapsing around this time.

I hope you're keeping it up. Each day I feel an improvement even if it's as small as getting less tired less often."
canadients,fcqy2ns,t1_fcoi9ul,1577893941.0,It likely is. This province is corrupt as fuck.
OpiatesRecovery,fcp4gpv,t3_eiaf1l,1577850172.0,I'm like something around 4 or 5 days. Tonight I .grateful for the chance to spend the evening and last night with the love of my life.
OpiatesRecovery,fcp4cwa,t3_eibqja,1577850080.0,"Give your body what it needs. Eat food with the stuff your cells need. Take supplements if possible. You're older so your body REALLY needs the help. Omega-3 supplement could help your brain heal maybe

Time is the real thing though."
depression,fcn5ywq,t3_ehzmhj,1577804154.0,"I've heard that basically your neural pathways get stuck in a cycle of connections. There is more to it then that but basically that's it. We are stick in a cycle of neurology and purhaps some personal traits.

lSD has been shown to sort of ""reset"" those pathways. I am not avocating for the use of LSD simply stating that some research has shown why depressed people tend to ruminate more.

Obviously Serotonin plays a role and possibly dopamine especially if you might also have ADHD."
OpiatesRecovery,fcn57bw,t1_fcn4zn4,1577803578.0,Thanks. It means alot to hear from other people. I am glad that I finally came out to my family and friends. It makes it alot easier not keeping the addiction in the dark.
OpiatesRecovery,fcn4pwp,t1_fcn4jr5,1577803205.0,"I was taking hydromorphone. I'd take up to 50mg a day. Not shooting mind you. I never got into that.

Near the end I was down to like 10mg a day."
OpiatesRecovery,fcn4him,t1_fcn44cv,1577803021.0,"Honestly, this is inspiring atleast for me. Like I know there will be some ups and downs but I've ALWAYS had those. I plan to get my doctor to prescribe antidepressants since her and I have been considering it for some time now and she's aware of my addiction.

She has honestly shown me the most compassion out of any medical professional I have ever seen. She know the insane amount of shit I have dealt with for three...no wait five years now. She actually understood that I had been at a point where I actually said, ""I'd I die from this tonight
 Good."" That's where the addition started.

Anywho, I'm on like day 4 or some shit. I don't have any bloody advil left so I need to go get some at some point."
OpiatesRecovery,fcn3jtq,t3_ei3dlw,1577802286.0,Can I ask you at what point your mental state started improving? That has always been my downfall and I am wondering if 2 weeks would generally be enough to have decent improvement in that area.
opiates,fcn1osu,t3_ehv5yv,1577800731.0,"I cannot get anything for atleast two weeks. I did this on purpose. This HAS to work or I don't know what my options will be.

I am so tired of it. Sure I love it...but I hate it...I hate basically having two people inside of me as my SO out it. She said ""I love this you. I'm scared of the other you.""

I mean, fuck. That is some scary shit for someone who has always had your back for years to say."
opiates,fcn1asz,t3_ei2w2p,1577800387.0,"You haven't given a route you will administer. Will you shoot them?(please don't.) Will you snort them? Or are you gonna shove a liquid solution up you butt?

My advice? Just don't take them at all. They've been my problem for THREE BLOODY YEARS.

But, if you're deadset on it...my advice? Start low 2-4mg and ride it out see how you feel. When I started literally 1-2mg while heavily drinking was enough. After that sniffing 2-4mg was enough....until it wasn't. And I was up to something like 50mg a day."
OpiatesRecovery,fcn11zs,t3_ei2i8t,1577800170.0,"Congratulations for making it this far. I know the feeling of missing things you'd do with your SO. My SO was the first to notice I was getting high. Literally noone else knew until I was getting pretty fucked up and nodding at times.

I miss being able to just enjoy the little things or enjoy life itself. Luckily my withdrawals are physically mild beyond a complete exhaustion but NSAIDS help nearly 100%. The mental side is what bloody kills me...but hey here I am gonna have two solid weeks with no chance to get anything so here's to hoping it worksnout this time.

I hope things work out for you. YOU are worth life and YOU are worth something. Be so thankful you have your husband by your side because I am Ina situation where I cannot have mine by my side and it kills me all of the time."

OpiateChurch,fbmyi7e,t3_edvwqi,1576990410.0,Those are some amazing looking capsules. The 9mg blues have been my demise these last 3 years. It's nice to see the variety of colors!
BPD,fbls1x8,t1_fbkja07,1576968808.0,"Thank you for the kind words and acknowledging that I am in a very poor situation and might have just needed to let it out. I haven't always been that lucky with people on Reddit. I have been told off on a number of occasions and recently in my favorite online game. I have played this game since 2002 and people were telling me to shut up, kill myself, who cares if you're depressed this is a game! It hurts when people are like that and I happen to be rather sensitive to words. I think that's part of the reason I have such low self-image."
opiates,fblrtid,t3_edvxco,1576968635.0,"I am not going to lie this gave me a good chuckle. Mostly becsuse I am going through a situation right now where the concept of 'Ohana' and 'no-one gets left behind.',

Good stuff though."
BPD,fbkhei3,t1_fbk2819,1576950379.0,"Thank you. I would like to believe that they do too. I don't know that the will though. What I do know is I will likely be forced to jump through so many legal hoops, court rooms, court cases, therapies,social workers, and whatever else to prove that I am a good person/father....which I already know that I am. 

I raised my firstborn more or less on my own with very little support from his mother while we loved together for the first 7months of his life. She wouldn't get out of bed in the morning to help get my stepson/her son unto the bus in the middle of winter(she had a car and liscense while I do not drive, period.) I would have to leave our son alone in his playpen bawling his eyes out while I tried to take her son to his bus.

I would come home from the bus and hear my son bawling his eyes out having a complete fit from the parking lot outside our flat. It brok my bloody heart into pieces hearing my young child screaming for his father while his mother laid there sleeping. During the summer months she took off fucking other men and seeking a new man for her life and left me with BOTH CHILDREN alone having to move back into my parents house after she kicked me out, she had a mental breakdown and was sent to the hospital, and I took care of those kids with help from my parents the entire summer.

Then in September as a nice ""thank you for doing this for me while I was not doing well mentally"" I was rewarded by being falsely accused of abusing her son. I spent 3 years fighting in court having CPS involved and in the end CPS closed the file and now she still has custody of our bioson 5 years later and all I have is visitation. She still insists that I am dangerous and has forced supervise visits on me for 5 entire years as I struggle to obtain a lawyer to fight for my rights because she moved with the kids 3hours away knowing that I do not drive.

I apologize. I've got alot on my mind and it's been killing me keeping it inside. I certainly hope that your situation improves as well. Infact I hope that EVERYONE around the world who is suffering eventually sees the end of their own suffering."
