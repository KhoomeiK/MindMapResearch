SwedishHouseMafia,fjge23h,t3_fd1ua4,1583323597.0,"Copy and pasted from an old comment of mine - 'While I kind of agree with your first point, I also want to offer a different way of looking at the situation. All three had solo careers before, and had their own directions. SHM was getting huge, and there was really only one direction they could go in - a more commercial direction that clearly didn't resemble much of Steve's other work. If Steve objected to the new direction that much, its probably better that they all broke it off when they did and ended with a great legacy (before the re-union lol), as opposed to overstaying their welcome as a group and resentingeach other until they inevitably broke up anyways.'

Also

>why would they just leave it

Steve didn't just leave it, he (As well as A ^ I) had great solo careers in between iterations of SHM. There's a good chance they were all three doing better separately than if they forced SHM for a few more years. 

I know I come off as a contrarian posting stuff like this so often, but I value what the boys did as SHM up to 2013, as well as their separate directions afterward to the point where I think its probably good that they finished up in 2013."
