Life will beat the shit out of you over and over again. And to make things worse, depression has to exist. Like who the fuck wants to be depressed? Nobody! We get caught up in so many little things, that we forget to enjoy life, to embrace its beauty. Theres just so much going on nowadays you feel so overwhelmed and stressed. And I get that. But listen yo, you just gotta ride the wave, one day you'll look back at life and ask yourself ""How the hell did I get through that?"" You're stronger than you think. Don't give up man."

If you are still breathing and you're on the verge of ending it, don't. Life sucks now and I know you've been suffering. The negatives always outweigh the positives, but despite that as clich√© as it sounds, life will get better. Focus on the here and now, forget about the past and don't get too ahead in the future. God has plans for you, and in order to make it happen he has to take some pieces and move them around to make your life better. We all struggle. I'm right there with you. You may leave this sub but don't leave this planet.

depression,fc2maxb,t3_efj7ls,1577366900.0,"It really sucks. I remember not getting anything for Christmas but didn't complain because I was having fun and enjoyed how life was for me back then. Every Christmas I feel the same emptiness, like how everyone gets presents and what not and people in joy while I'm there sitting out wishing something would change. What tear me apart the most was when I realized that even when I was a child I didn't get anything for Christmas, it always bothered me because the other kids in class would ramble on about what they got and how happy they were. I felt like I wasn't loved by my family and it always brought me down. I didn't want to be greedy always asking for things but I've been working hard to change my life for the better. It just feels like my family hasn't treated me like everyone else when I was a kid and so I always had those thoughts that pull me back. Especially during holiday season it's just horrible. The sense of feeling not worthy, feeling like you never accomplished anything it's tough. Hopefully 2020 will be the year of growth. End of a decade, start of another.
