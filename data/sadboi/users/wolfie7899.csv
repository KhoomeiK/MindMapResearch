mentalhealth,ez8h40z,t3_d0a5n2,1567743247.0,I wouldn’t worry too much about it but I would sit there and every time you have a passive thought of suicide make sure you’re pushing it out so that it doesn’t linger. The thoughts can come and go you got to put good thoughts with those thoughts are.

mentalhealth,exq7c14,t3_cu0orv,1566498809.0,As someone with bipolar i know that feeling. I had to learn to expect the downs with the ups. Depression can be episodic as in it can come and go. I hope your isnt but its good to be ready incase it comes back.
mentalhealth,exq6uy7,t3_cu0yk7,1566498637.0,When you need the help being in the hospital isnt that bad. Better then the alternative. Maybe see if they have a partial hospital program where you go during the day but are home at night and weekends.
SuicideWatch,ev8gepq,t3_cipdqy,1564278805.0,I would be honest with the nurse tomorrow.

mentalhealth,euiv8is,t1_euiuw28,1563856041.0,Also if you mention the suicide attempt make sure you mention that you are feeling better are you are no longer suicidal when you do talk to a professional.
selfharm,euiv205,t3_cgnkor,1563855927.0,Why must they go deep? Just causing the blood to seep from your veins should be enough to ease the pain I mean at least it is for me. Making them go deeper and deeper only causes scars that will be more horrific when you get older and don’t want people to see them And pass judgment.I kind of used to be the same way were one of the cats to go as deep as possible but then I learn the more blood that came out to more relief the deeper the repeating of the pain.
mentalhealth,euiurtz,t3_cgnnyx,1563855759.0,First off talk to a professional like your primary dr. Then try to give yourself a break about the attempt.My attempt was almost 3 weeks ago this Thursday and Tuesday and Wednesday before that. I seek to see if your primary doctor or professional to get help with this because they’re the only ones that you can talk to you about it that won’t flip out I can’t tell anybody also. If you feel like your sisters might be of some support talk to them about how you’re feeling but might not be a good idea to mention The attempt. If need be feel free to message me I have read it on my iPhone my iPad and I plan on putting it on my iPod. Good luck.

selfharm,eufhhod,t3_cg8w25,1563774583.0,"You wont automatically get sent to the hospital for self harm. Be completely honest with the doctor. They will almost definitely ask if the self harm is to cause death or suicide. If it’s not tell them that. I have been a self harmer for around well as far back as I can remember. And its been yrs since they put you in for self harm alone. Plus i was just in last week after an attempt and self harm , but only because i was still actively suicidal........ now if you are a minor then your parents can have you put in, as they wont understand."
selfharm,eufgtx1,t3_cg8ydk,1563773840.0,"Now it’s best to try to push it back out.  The only time i let that demon into my life is when i can use it to stop a suicide attempt. That didnt work two weeks ago so for me it will be trying to fully obstain. As it is the only thing i can become addicted to, and i dont need that."
selfharm,eufg8xj,t3_cg90hm,1563773192.0,"Take up boxing or something like that,, even basketball can cause a lil pain. And it will make you tired there for not thinking about the bad in your life as much anymore."
