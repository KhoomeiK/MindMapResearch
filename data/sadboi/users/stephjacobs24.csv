AskReddit,fqvp2eh,t1_fqtsvsw,1589682003.0,This question makes me instantly angry. I can't physically have my own children. I've never even wanted kids neither does my husband. I tell people I cant have kids and then it's a shit ton of other questions and unasked for advice on things I could do to try to have kids or that I could adopt. I'm not infertile I can get pregnant. I just have a chance of both me and baby dying if I do. I really hate when people say things like oh you'll change your mind or you're still young. I'm 23 I can make my own decisions and do you really want my husband to go through possibly losing his wife and child in an instant just to feed your ego. People are so infuriating.

She and I got put in all separate classes for awhile and while I tried to talk to her like an adult to figure out what was going on a teacher she really liked came over and basically got in the middle of us like I was about to attack this girl. I'm 5ft 120lbs this other girl was twice my size. None of the teachers or principal believed me that I did nothing wrong and I had no idea what was going on. The only reason I didn't get kicked out of school was because the vice principal loved me and knew me really well. That girl was a cunt, she made my life hell for weeks."

He was dating this girl and she tried to break up with him at the end of a school day because he was low key stalking her and super controlling etc. He all of the sudden gets up and grabs her by her neck slamming her to the wall in the air and holds a knife to her throat. He's screaming horrible things in her face and it took three other guys to pull him off without being stabbed. She was okay I was actually the first person to get to her after she was let go. The police came and he left in hand cuffs. This was freshman year of high school.

When we got our new place he insisted on coming over and spending the night so he and my husband could stay up all night and party like 'old times' again. We told him he could come over but not staying the night cuz we both work six days a week and this guy doesn't have a job. So he comes over at 9pm with a bag of stuff convinced he's staying which already set me off. He looks around our apartment without taking off his muddy shoes making little comments about how small and weird it looks. (he still lives with mommy and daddy at 24yrs old) then he decides to go into our kitchen and start rummaging through our fridge without asking and taking small things of food again without asking. He took a can of soda, opened it, took one drink of it and left it on our table. The whole time basically ignoring my existence because he's always hated me, fishing for snide little comments about our marriage and how great the old times were when they were teens. Then we finally tell him it's getting late he needs to leave. So he tries to get into our alcohol to start drinking so he couldn't leave or trying to convince my husband to go to a party. That's when he got kicked out and he hasn't been back here ever since. That guys always been a lost cause and will never grow up.
