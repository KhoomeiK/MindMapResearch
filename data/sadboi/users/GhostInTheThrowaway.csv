texas,fczqbil,t3_ejh3tr,1578106745.0,"I got a DUI in July and while waiting for the blood work to come back still I have to get pee tested every court date. No drugs or alcohol or it’s a violation. 

Well a few months ago I tested positive for marijuana metabolites and the online activities listing showed a violation with the action from the judge listed as just “continued supervision.” Nobody said a word to me. Judge didn’t speak to me. Supervision officer didn’t say anything to me. My lawyer didn’t even know about it until I told him about it. Then just said everything is fine. 

I hadn’t touched anything with weed in it (edibles) since a month before the DUI...so that’s about 4 months prior to the failed test. I have some serious metabolic issues and I was seriously afraid I would continue testing positive for a long time because everything so read said that was too long to still be testing positive. And why did the court bother testing me if they didn’t even care? Just to cause massive anxiety?

My lawyer said he thinks it’s possible they’re taking so long on the blood work because I had only had 3 glasses of wine hours earlier while shopping a bazaar (I was dumb and told the officers that because I knew I was fine) so if I was under the legal limit they’ll send it back looking for any kind of drug to blame it on. Well, clearly I would test positive for marijuana even though I was not actually on it. 

I have no point at all. Just that it so random how we pick a handful of mind altering substances to outlaw and just ignore some really dangerous ones...then okay certain people to use the outlawed substances while destroying the lives of others for the exact same substances. All while saying it’s because “That substance is so dangerous” but the most dangerous impact most people ever experience is repercussions of crossing a cop while holding it."

AskReddit,f0movek,t3_d5kudg,1568749864.0,Having to put a thing I wanted back on the shelf to buy another thing at the grocery store. I always see items left in weird spots in the grocery store where you can see choices had to be made & the cost of the items was maybe a few dollars. Makes me sad. I always keep an eye out so that maybe one day I can prevent someone from having to choose between a pack of lunch meat and a pack of diapers. Sure would give me a shot of the feel good chemicals.

“Hi this is Nash Brown calling you from the Department of Social Security administration the reason you have received his phone call from our department is to inform you that there's a legal enforcement on your Social Security number for fraudulent activities so when you get this message kindly call back at the earliest possible on our number before we begin with the legal proceedings that is 858-519-9303 I repeat 858-519-9303 thank you and have a nice day…”

I don’t answer my phone to strange numbers & I didn’t call them back because I definitely couldn’t do so “kindly” but the accent makes me assume that the caller is actually the fraudulent activity."
