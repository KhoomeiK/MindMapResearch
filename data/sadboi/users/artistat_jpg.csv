CoronavirusUS,fnfd5zh,t3_g14vyk,1586905818.0,"I work for Potbelly Sandwich shop, and they’ve nearly cut my hours in half, cut all cooperate salary by 25%, GM salary by 10%, and refuse to let us wear gloves while handling cash or cards. No hazard pay. Nothing. Customers are still allowed in our stores, even though we have a drive thru. But even the drive thru has no glass panel to protect us. All these other fast food restaurants have the panels, and they wear gloves and sometimes even have a Tupperware to put your money in so they don’t have to touch you. But our CEO is too worried about “scaring the customers away”. I’ve gotten to the point where I’m taking my PTO, and not going back."
TooAfraidToAsk,fhzgd67,t3_f5bc7k,1581998804.0,"(Not my account but I won’t sign my girlfriend out just to refind this and post from my account so) Honestly I’ve been having the same thought recently. I skipped college because my girlfriend of six years was kicked out and needed me to help her find a place to stay. Since then I’ve held a couple little jobs but just got one that offers great benefits, okay pay (we could live on it for a while if we had to), and is in a relatively good location. We have an apartment that isn’t so bad. And now I’m stuck wondering if I’m going to just go through the same thing over and over again forever. I don’t want to do this forever, and the fact that I may be doing it anyway has me so god damn depressed. (I’m pretty sure my tag is YourParadise98 or something, I’ll probably delete this and repost it later on my account)"

So I was wondering what the general guidelines were as to what and what not to bring, and how strict security is, etc. I have some flow toys ( poi and a whip) that I want to bring too. Any tips would be appreciated! Thanks!!"
depression,eqs6tmm,t3_bzc9jt,1560278030.0,I’m going through the exact same thing. I have people who rely on me and I can’t let them down but I’m so exhausted that I can’t find the motivation to get things done.

depression,eq3qty7,t3_bx65d3,1559761230.0,"I’ve been going through the same thing. The stress of living on my own has driven me into a hole of repetition of just work, smoke, sleep. I spend almost every day alone except for my bf who lives with me, but he games online w/ friends a lot. I just lay on the couch and do nothing. And it’s even harder when people don’t seem to notice or try to help, even when you’ve stopped trying to hide it because you don’t have the energy and know you need help."
chicagoEDM,eotom5d,t1_emgqgny,1558845161.0,"Honestly, it’s comforting to me. Plus it’s great to keep yourself warm, and it’s almost like a layer of protection.  I wear mine everywhere, so going anywhere without it feels weird to me. It’s just a comfort/protective item to a lot of people."
