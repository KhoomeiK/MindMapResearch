Is he in good health? My boy will be 13 this year, and about 6 months ago he was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism... he has lost a ton of weight, cries when using the bathroom, drinks a ton, walks around the house crying out, etc. It's heartbreaking. 💔 He's on Methimazole, for the rest of his life, and they say that the hyperthyroidism can eventually lead to other serious problems. I'm so sad about it. 

The good thing is, that he acts like he is happy. Still loving as ever, plays with his toys, and loves his furry brother (Peaches) to pieces. I feel like he's got a good life as of right now, so we just have to have his blood checked regularly to see what his levels are like so we can adjust the dose if needed. It is expensive, but I don't care... he's my child, you know?

I was diagnosed in my early teens, and am now 35. I'm still looking for answers and acceptance. Still looking for the right med combo, therapist, and guidance. I tried to take my life in my teens, it obviously didn't work. I wouldn't do it now as I have kids, but I do self harm. I started picking my skin, as I was diagnosed with dermatillomania. It's a horrible thing to deal with as I've wrecked my skin, causing me to hate myself more, and be more depressed. I've also turned to drugs, alcohol, and sex... didn't find the right answers there either. 

I wish I had a magic answer for you my love, but I don't. I can only say this. You are NOT alone. Just know that nothing lasts forever. There will be a day when you will at least find a balance. Keep fighting, no matter what. Your life matters. All of our lives matter. Even if we don't think so. I wish you all the best, if you ever need/ want to talk, please PM me. I'd leave my email, but I don't know if it is allowed. Take care of yourself, you will get thru this, promise!

In my bed at the moment, eating some strawberry Haagen Dazs, watching TV, crying randomly, then raging, then back to crying again. Hopelessly and tirelessly wondering what my purpose is on this earth. My husband doesn't want to deal with me, my kids are mean as hell to me, they don't understand depression, my son asked me tonight why I want depression. I told him I'd give my fingers, toes, legs, and arms to have one day, even an hour, of true happiness. I'd spend every second of it with him, giving him the mom he truly deserves.
