relationship_advice,fmokm05,t3_fwixhv,1586261913.0,"I wouldn’t worry about the term “Normal” when you think about your relationship. Worry about the term “healthy”. 

I can give you my perspective from personal experience, but every relationship is different and can still be happy that way. 

I fully moved in with my boyfriend about six months into dating him. I was always over there about three months in, but I did have my own apartment at the time. I left for a month on a trip a few days after I had moved my stuff in and when I came back the issues started. 

We don’t get it screaming matches or curse at each other, it’s just not our personalities. However, we would argue over cleaning, cooking, running errands, working. The phrase “I can leave and take my shit with me” was used quite a bit on my behalf. My boyfriend made it clear he would not try to stop me or talk about it if I did. By our anniversary he said he wasn’t attracted to me anymore (I didn’t find that our until 3 months later). He would avoid coming home after work because he felt all I did was nag him the moment he came through the door. There was bickering over money too. Sounds like we aren’t right for each other? He never left and I never left and time passed on. I told him we are trying to squish to different lives into one. It makes sense that it’s going to be frustrating like this. To be honest I could be just convincing myself.

It stayed that way for almost a year, I think. Even Those fights slowed down and turned into conversations every few months about things we needed to change. He wants time to decompress when he get home from work. I can do that. I expect help around the house. He can do that. 

Our third year is in November and we’ve moved into a new apartment together. 

So to me yes, it’s healthy to be stubborn about changing your way of life, it’s natural. There are other red flags in my relationship that I acknowledge. 

IMO that whole situation was totally normal even for my parents who have been married for 15 years and so very in love still. HOWEVER, there is a red flag there. His ‘you should be sorry’. Over asking him to go to the store while you are working on a task. Everyone plays their role. Was he doing anything while you were working? You should not be sorry for asking him. There will always be a part of the story we don’t know. I apologize to my boyfriend for every argument and he will forgive me. Only more recently do I tell him I won’t apologize for things that aren’t my fault. That doesn’t mean it’s his fault. Sometimes it’s no ones fault and the world is a crazy place. 

I am so sorry this is so long. I really hope y’all talk it out and you ask yourself “Can I live my whole life like it is right now?”  If the answer is no, what exactly needs to change? Is he willing to change that (he needs to say it directly) or are you willing to give it up forever? If the answer is no, then you’re going have to break up. If not now, then eventually you will lose respect or love for him because your needs aren’t being met. 

I wish you both a loving life! 

P.s. my boyfriend and I are both introverts and we can stay in our one bedroom apartment playing games for weeks. If either of you are extroverts, this is a trying time. Stay safe!"

He should let her know that her insecurities can cause him stress during a time he needs to focus on his well being. He really was looking forward to her understanding his situation. They both were upset with the situation for different reason. Both of them deserve that.” 

The issue isn’t what happened it’s her self-confidence is based off of her boyfriend’s image of who she is. It’s not a matter of growing up, it’s a matter of talking about the real issue at hand. They always say you have to love yourself before you can love some else. This is a pretty textbook scenario for that."

You’re full of shit. I don’t know why you want everything handed to you. Hard working people make this country. We make ends meet and don’t cut corners. The phrase you gotta do what you gotta do. YOU signed up to be an Independent Contractor. You agreed to follow proper cleaning and food safety protocols since the moment you agreed to the terms and conditions. YOU have to provide those things for yourself. I have always kept hand sanitizer on me, I have always cleaned my basket, my car and my cooler bags. I shop at the same store for every single order. There is very little I’m having to change due to the virus. You ran out? They restock, so why don’t you wait in line to try to find some? Did you search all kinds of sites? They are restocking too. Your hands are dry? Buy lotion. My hands have been cracking from it, I know it’s a bitch. “Bigger than yourself”? Fuck right off self righteous. Do you help at the food bank? Do you donate to the homeless programs? Kids or old people programs? Probably fucking not. If you do, then how are you still so narrow minded. You know who fucking does. My ass. I know how life can knock your two front teeth out. And I’m not on any high horse about being a part of the “bigger picture”. I know what it’s like to worry about your gas, your family, your food. Yes, I went to the food bank from almost 6 months and still struggled with everything thrown my way. There’s a nice list of things I’ve had to give up. 

No one personally contacted us and asked us to participate or petition. No one said we were happy or complacent. Fuck, I didn’t even know till Tuesday we were even doing a fucking strike. Get off your high fucking horse, you don’t understand what it’s like or you would give sympathy to those who make the choices they do for those exact reasons. 

P.s. masks aren’t necessary, they are more of a risk of you touching your face. Unless you are the one coughing, avoid it. Gloves however can be very useful, just make sure you don’t touch your face, that’s the golden rule. I hope you stay healthy during this time, please be cautious."

I have trigger foods that tend to lead to excessive eating, pastas and pizza are the two big ones. If you have an eating/food addiction your trigger might be chocolate items. I am very verbal about this with my boyfriend, he buys snacks for work. I’m not a big fan of sweets, but if he buys them I’m going to eat at least one. If he buys soda or Gatorade, I’m going to have at least one. That’s what I tell him and that’s my limit to myself. Is it hard to keep? Hell yeah. Do I sometimes eat two and feel guilty? Hell yeah. So if I do I go buy him more or offer to buy the expensive snacks he likes. However, this is a two way street. My boyfriend tries to understand and I try to be considerate of him. At the end of the day I think your boyfriends going to have to stop using the “you’re an adult” excuse and try to understand that...addiction doesn’t work that way. Not with drugs, not with caffeine (soda and coffee, stop drinking them you will have withdrawal symptoms), and definitely not with food issues.

THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG POST I HAVE NO FRIENDS. 

-good oranges/grapefruit are meant to be stiff. That also taught me that most oranges in the store aren’t at that ripeness level. 

-All bell peppers come from the exact same plant, it’s just how long they have ripened. From yellow to orange to red to green. The hell?

-most grocery store meats have a small amount of chemicals injected to them to keep them red, since Americans associate fresh beef/ pork to have color. 

-unlike others, most of my orders don’t eat enough fruits and veggies. Those who do show interest in eating fruits and veggies tend to use processed instead of whole (which is preferred). They will get Cauliflower pizza, veggie straws, juiced smoothie drinks and the like. 

-eggs have a long ass self life imo 

-grocery store almost NEVER have fresh pineapple, they are always picked to soon. 

-you can ripen bananas and avocados quicker by putting them in a brown paper bag closing it and leaving overnight. I use brown bags and have lots of happy customers for this reason alone. 

-I’ve learned a lot about picking ripe produce. Eggplant, all the squashes, pomegranates, strawberries and garlic to name a few. 

-the pinker the tilapia, the fresher the tilapia. 

-most people don’t know what produce is in season and they don’t care. No I can not get you cherries in December, nor can you expect perfect strawberries in December. THEY. ARE. NOT. IN. SEASON. 

-I always know what’s on sale or when they get shipments in that benefits my shopping as someone mentioned. 

-Last but not the least, I have added many recipes and foods into my house because someone bought the ingredients for it or it looked interesting. I also try the samples at HEB in Texas they have cooking sections where they make a full meal to taste and take the recipe home. Totally bomb.
