It‚Äôs all algorithms. Computer programming but biological and organic base. What do you think DNA is? What is a cell?- a microscopic preprogrammed organic robot. We are just made of trillions of them. Thoughts can be broken down to a change in charges within neurons- essentially electricity. Electric impulses used to communication between robots of comprised of smaller robot comprised of- and so forth. That is essentially what human consciousness is. Would you now consider it to be consciousness. If it is all preprogrammed within dna. And evolving algorithm based upon the combination of two sources of data and code. Your thoughts, like all things from a computer based entity, are consisted of preprogrammed information and experienced/learned information. Everything you saw, spoke, heard, felt has all been broken down and translated into a language your brain can understand, your brains code. Then translated again into whatever language you speak. Your understanding is the association between languages. Your part of the brain that is not connected to what you consider your conscious self has its own code. Then their is your code - English, etc. In order to turn raw sensory data into English your brain must translate it into a language, raw abstract thought, that can be easily translated to English. This language between them is the most efficient way to think. You understand an idea conceptually without haveing to associate sensory data or English with the concept. Allowing you think quickly and connect thoughts together rapidly."
