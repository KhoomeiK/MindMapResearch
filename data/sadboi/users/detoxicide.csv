depression,fa6gs1q,t1_fa63cog,1575824571.0,"I appreciate you taking the time out very much but I really do just have to say you have no idea how absolutely grateful I am for everyone and everything in my life. I acknowledge how lucky I am in a constant way and try to remind myself. I really AM lucky and I am constantly expressing and feeling gratitude. I have a very specific and deep empathy. I also have a resolve toward postivity and try to maintain that as much as possible. I'm not lying when I say I give myself Stewart smalley-esque peptalks on the regular to keep myself going.

I also feel a very close connection to God and the subconscious spirit world and I feel very certainly that I am here to do good things.

I don't know what to say because there are times when I legitimately cannot feel anything but a deep depression that encompasses my being, and it is incredibly difficult for me to keep track of my psyche during those times. I am an intelligent person, I have been seeing therapists openly my entire life. I've graduated from a year long DBT workshop. I try to use all of the skills I've learned, not just from DBT, but from my years of seeking psychological treatment and practicing self learning. 

But try as I might from around thanksgiving time and up until a bit past my birthday (February) I am a legitimate hot mess of a person and it's very upsetting to me and those closest. I love these people so much, and I am nothing but grateful. Like when I was supposed to help my mom by driving her to the bank to settle an issue the other day, I woke up and was like, traumatized with anxiety about having to do that. Not even having to do that but... Just traumatized that I had to participate in reality. I was fucking hysterical with anxiety about having to do it, and hysterical with guilt about disappointing my family, hysterical with sadness in regard to my mother's condition and longevity, scared to drive since I was recently in a car crash. I couldn't even function. I had the tv off for 4 hours after I woke up and sat in silence just freaking out. When I got up the courage to call my sister and let her know what was happening with me I didn't get a guilt trip, she was kind and understanding and told me to calm down and not worry and that she arranged for her father in law to take them without any problem. The absolute relief I felt, I was awash with gratitude and telling her I appreciate and love her, how lucky I am. The rest of the night was kind of spent, alone and crying and feeling upset, feeling worthless, feeling like nothing... But being depressed does not necessarily mean a person has to be reminded to be grateful or be reminded that they are fortunate. 

I don't know if I can specifically blame SAD because I also had a time period this july where I went through a similar depression/anxiety but it was short and much easier to work through. In winter I don't stand a chance to combat it. I'm trying bro, but its... I can't even describe it. The stress in my brain, I feel like I can pinpoint the area of my brain where the pain exudes from is the amygdala, I can feel that thing in there throbbing with hurt and pain. I'm not even in THAT bad of a spot but I am in complete tears right now as I write this, acknowledging the constant feeling of pain and sadness radiating out of the area in my skull where that gland sits.

I'm going to start taking vitamin D and mabye get a light therapy lamp or something. It's very hard for me to meditate because my emotions are so over-stimulated. Im very overwhelmed and I know it seems like such a cop out to just hate yourself, and I think it is too (rationally speaking). But I don't feel rational with these emotions swarming around.  I'm really sick over this, I can be sick at any moment with grief. It's very hard for me to hold back tears going on several weeks now. On cue I can just sob at a moments notice, it's just sitting there. So idk."

I think writing it out helped in a cathartic way. My mood is lighter. I woke up my grumpy sleepy boyfriend to keep me company he's making us tea as we speak. Today we celebrate my sister's birthday, and I refuse to bring any of this there. I want to enjoy my family today. I can't let this dark cloud ruin that."
depression,fa45fpj,t1_fa3uf0t,1575801197.0,"I love and care so much through everything, for everyone. I help take care of my mother and make things best for her. I understand she has issues which is why she parentifyied me as a child, so when she calls me ""mama"" I call her my ""little baby"" to make sure her time left on earth is met with love. I go out of my way for everyone, to show as much love as I can. I give what I have so freely that I'm left with nothing. To assume I am not a loving or forgiving person isn't fair. I'm allowed to have any feelings I want in regard to realizations I am coming to about how I was raised. That is my right to have strong emotions regarding past trauma.

I dig your comment, and I see what your trying to say but to shut off my feelings and love everyone instead is A. Much easier said than fucking done and B. Doesn't always work. That is my life extending genuine kindness, caring, and love to anyone I approach and having to deal with an internal darkness because of it. 

So to just tell me to be grateful for what I have, to stop feeling sad and be happy and automatically stop having reasonable resentments (as if my pain and hurt in regard to those resentments doesnt count or qualify) is demeaning when I am seriously dealing with very heavy mental imbalances. ""Just buck up, be greatful, shut off all of your pain, since it doesn't count, and give all of yourself and your love and caring to everyone else all the time"". I do see the point of what you're trying to say. I appreciate your comment but fuck, if life were only so simple. Thanks for the advice."

ShaneDawson,ew88ksh,t3_clg08i,1565205483.0,"Its clear the process of getting some sort of ""insider"" look into establishing a makeup line would definitely be a long process consisting of months, possibly years, worth of time. Honestly I dont produce makeup so i cant tell you, but im assuming a multi-million dollar venture, in a subject you know nothing about, might be time and energy consuming.

We are Also assuming he has a lot of footage rip roaring and ready to go, which could be a possibility but may not be the case. The business world isn't always exciting. Shayne could just be googling ""makeup industry"" and youtubing tutorials all day and that wouldnt be too content worthy (or would it?). But lets say he has tons of footage that hes saving for a big blast, 6 part special consisting of hour long videos. Then why can't they be broken into installments and come more gradually? Why does everything have to be in a ""block"" format? 

I believe he is trying to establish himself as a more legitimate film maker, the first opportunity he has to leave youtube I'm sure he'll jump at. He's just cutting the cord early for a less frequent posting schedule as well as tailoring his content to be long form, to legitimize himself in the film (or more probably just Netflix) industry.

Real talk, hes been doing YT full time for how many years? Hes probably bored as shit with the format. Also, hes rich as fuck and lazy, and he has a right to be. He is rich enough to pursue any interests or work any schedule he wants at this point. And it's hardly a silverspoon, Shane is who he is from hard work and dedication. If I had that option in my life id probably take my time with stuff too.

But I feel (my personal opinion) like these blocks of hours long content are the wrong idea. It would be smarter if he befriended people in the documentary film or reality TV industry and work his way in that way instead of forcing large portions of media on us. Hes alieniating his core audience by not conforming to posting his content in a more precise way.

The simple issue at hand is people were used to him as a frequent feature in their consciousness and now all of his fans miss him. To use that energy as a way to get people to binge watch your hours long content, thereby filling your bank account, is sort of manipulative to me but not necessarily intentionally. I feel like Shane is at a standstill. He doesnt fit into the Jake Paul scene, and he's trying to fit in with the Jeffery Star scene but ultimately it seems like he's just bored.

Or maybe he just needs to up his adderall dosage, idk."

Mediums,eurbea6,t1_erqfw1h,1563991949.0,"You say ""wearing a wig"" man I have something to say about that. My great aunt who raised me visits me almost annually to her death date. During every encounter it's almost as if she is effecting trying to be back in her body. Like, shes always off in some way and every single time I see her something is off with her eyes, either they're whited out or almost emitting huge powerful rays of light.

It's like she's putting on a ""person suit"" of who she was to me. I noticed in my last dream she was looking fancy with makeup and a pretty outfit and I caught her looking at the mirror and talking to it, sort of play acting something she might say if she were alive and being social. I said to her ""you know I'm over here right?"" She says, ""oh yes"". 
 
In another dream she was dressed as my boyfriend except had her old purse. I pursued her, and said ""look at me, if this is really you look at me right now"" an intense sleep paralysis feeling occured at that point and she began turning her head to me and it emitted a light like I cannot describe and it woke me up in a flash, sobbing. I woke up sobbing, it was very intense.

I feel like it's not easy for them to travel to that space just like lucid dreaming and trying to maneuver and understand that dreamscape is difficult for us also.

Today is the second anniversary of her passing, it's almost like I feel her in my heart all day. I feel really lucky to have that, to still have her in this capacity is a godsend and it makes me really feel like there IS something else. It makes me certain. What it is, we dont know. I'd love to find out."

It's not taking him very long to record and edit, not as long as he says anyway. At least not for hour long eps."
dxm,eu545wk,t1_eu3prsv,1563469511.0,Do you think that was just 4th plat? Has 4th plat ever sobered you out?
dxm,eu3lhfv,t1_eu3in76,1563417916.0,And I wouldn't consider it redosing. Redosing is when you dose after your comedown or afterglow. I've had bad experiences with that.
dxm,eu3lek2,t1_eu3f7rx,1563417851.0,"The way I trip I wouldnt consider it ""redosing"" because there is no come down. I wait till the effects of the first plat hit then dose up to each consecutive plat. I've redosed after coming down and had awful experiences with it. But idk what to say. 1350mg at once is a huge amount, I would be scared to do that."
