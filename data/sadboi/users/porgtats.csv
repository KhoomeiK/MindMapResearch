depression,f1mhww4,t3_da0f6k,1569594302.0,"Generally as little as possible, even when I'm at work or college I will plug my headphones in to shut the world out. If someone talks to me I will often ignore it and say that I have bad hearing if they get annoyed about it and I will go out of my way to avoid having to start a conversation with someone unless I really have to. 

Probably about an hour or two are actually spent talking."
depression,f1mhp6z,t3_da0mvl,1569594159.0,"Like you said feeling no interest in doing things is often a really good sign of things. One of the ones you really need to keep an eye out for is change in your diet. Either you're eating more, or loads of sugary food as a form of comfort, or maybe you're eating less and enjoying bland tasteless food more.

Both are signs that I tend to get which show the underlying problem that I have, I either go between the two depending on the severity of my depression on that day, so days I'm a bit happier I comfort eat and binge, but days when I feel suicidal I tend to not eat much and only want things without taste. That might just be my eating disorders kicking in but diet can say a lot about how you're feeling."

I like being a vegetarian as it just agrees with my body more, like how some people do well on the carnivore diet, and I like the fact that I know that even by a faction too small to evrn messure I'm helping the environment by not supporting over farming of animals."

AskReddit,er1h3o9,t1_er1gpt3,1560431759.0,It's such an underrated album and it's one that I will always recommend whenever someone asks me about music.
AskReddit,er1dymu,t3_bzugn8,1560430514.0,"I would take a copy of Yelawolfs Love Story, massive classic for me and my all time favorite album. A copy of HIMs razorblade romance, that's an album I can listen to again and again on repeat without ever getting bored. Waylon Jennings greatest hits being my 3rd, I love outlaw country music and it fits the bill perfectly. The last 2 albums would be BG Knocc Out and Drestas Real Brothas and Death Grips No love Deep Web. While not my most favorite albums they are something I can listen to a lot and just enjoy for what they are."
AskReddit,er1dh5q,t1_eqwx8eg,1560430313.0,"I would still say Love Story was his best album to date. I had been listening to Yelawolf for about 5 years with him being my favorite artist, but as soon as that dropped he went to a whole different level for me. That album influenced me so much and really helped make me who I am today. It's such a huge part of my life and I'm so happy I preordered the collectors edition."
CasualUK,eqk2uj1,t3_bymbic,1560115267.0,"Here's a tip for all the people arguing whether own brand cheap tablets are better than expensive ones. They're all the same. Made in the same factory, exactly the same way. No added ingredients to make one better.

You're just paying extra for a brand name, and if you think the expensive works better its a placebo effect because you think it'll be better because it costs more. Save yourself some dosh."
buildapc,eoidyyf,t3_bs2qdn,1558617498.0,"Personally I would opt for a Ryzen at the moment since they're going really cheap, so you can get more bang for your buck, so probably the Ryzen 5 2600. While not making a massive difference in price it helps take it down a tad. 

You could also consider lowing the GPU to the Radeon 570 to save a little extra if you're willing to sacrifice some performance. You'll still be running games really well and at a good quality.

Have you already got a keyboard/mouse and monitor for this build?"
