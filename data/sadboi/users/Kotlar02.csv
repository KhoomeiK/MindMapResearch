depression,foiu44u,t3_g7o4nr,1587797067.0,"I get stomach pains when I am particularly anxious, I assume you get anxiety along side your depression like I do, but that's what happens to me,  I understand it's not that simple but trying to just relax, even if you can't relax your mind try to relax your body, I can't recommend enough listening to asmr, it has really helped me just listening to something quiet and relaxing, and most importantly DISTRACTING, even soft music might help if you're not into asmr, I hope this helps.

Stay strong bro"
