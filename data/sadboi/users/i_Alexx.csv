PlusSize,fq4bn2f,t1_fq4avr3,1589075732.0,That is true. Good idea.

PlusSize,fq3zr91,t1_fq3ygui,1589072130.0,"I totally understand where you're coming, and I apologize for them treating you this way! You deserve to be treated just the same as everyone no matter what weight. You've got a good personality and great work ethic, what does it matter if you've got more tummy than others?! I'm sorry once again that you're being discriminated against."
PlusSize,fq3w5yn,t1_fq3vc6i,1589070994.0,That sucks! I am so sorry that has happened to you.

PlusSize,fq3reqb,t1_fq3oorw,1589069330.0,"Ah, I see. Kinda lame when you can be the most friendly person with a pretty face, but if you don't have the idealistic body you're out."
PlusSize,fpinvzo,t1_fpimyyz,1588644849.0,"I usually get scars as well! It is super painful, I just want to look cute in something and sport bras aren't the most cute thing. I'm not too sure if it is my breast size or I'm just not wearing the right bra for me, or it's just the size of my stomach. I will definitely take the suggestions and look around a bit. Thank you!"
PlusSize,fpim0fn,t1_fpii7j4,1588643701.0,"The bra usually feels fine itself, it's just the wire part digging into my stomach. Thank you, I'll take that into consideration though! :)"

depression,fclermp,t1_fcleaae,1577746111.0,Thank you for saying that. I appreciate it. I'm just in dark times.

depression,fbmg6pl,t1_fbmeij2,1576983275.0,"Constantly. We actually argue over it sometimes, and as I said i tend to get irritated or angry over stupid things. He is just trying to have fun and do his own thing. I tell myself that all the time. He works all day and wants to come home and do his own thing, so I feel like he doesn't really want to do stuff. I bring stuff up occasionally, but he doesn't seem interested."
depression,fbme063,t1_fbmcy1r,1576982351.0,"I like to talk with him a lot, usually. We don't really go on walks but sometimes we take drives. Most of the time he likes to stay home on his computer. So. Most of the time we stay in the house. That kinda upsets me, but I just kinda want to do whatever makes him happy. I feel as if my opinion doesn't matter."

depression,fbm4c4y,t3_edpkii,1576978013.0,"Yes, I thought it was just me. Ever since my depression got worse, my anger increasingly got worse. It's like some kind of coping mechanism, or maybe a way for me to not feel sad anymore. 

I usually find myself getting annoyed at everything for absolutely no reason. I could be in the best mood and just get angry out of the blue."
