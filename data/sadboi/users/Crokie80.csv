ptsd,ffvurbt,t3_evdijk,1580273846.0,"I am by NO means mocking you when I say this....buy I recently came out to myself as myself, and my panic attacks have lessened.  

By this, I mean that I am being my total self.  No front to anyone about how I feel...I say it. (albeit with respect)  If someone is lying their ass off (which has happened twice now at work), I call them out on it.  I don't just keep my mouth shut anymore.

That being said, I still have flashbacks, but not as much as I did a couple months ago.  I have to believe that us being true to who we are, has something to do with it!"
ptsd,fby6cd1,t1_fbxsdvs,1577209168.0,"Yes!  There is a guy at work that is essentially a trigger for me as  whole.  I eventually had to go to the supervisor about it.  I normally would deal head on, but the guy is a really immature 25yr old.  The look I got from my supervisor when I said I had PTSD, seriously, and that this guy is a trigger, was interesting to say the least.  I also had to explain ""trigger"" as in not what the kids say when they get pissed about something.  He just looked at me and raised his eyebrows a bit.  He said he'd take care of it.  

I kind of feel like the supervisor was looking at me with disbelief. But whatever.  The guy is super professional and only speaks to me about business now, so all good I guess!"
ptsd,fby60wv,t3_eevxcx,1577208945.0,"I find it irritating in the sense that it isn't taken seriously, but at the same time, it takes away some of that stigma.  I guess I am 50/50 on that!"
