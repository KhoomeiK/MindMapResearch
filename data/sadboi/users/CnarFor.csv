Your face should be more than enough to find a good looking woman. 

As far a finding jobs and a girl, I have nothing but empathy for you on that aspect.

All you can do is hope, and keep on trying."

tall,ffufuid,t3_ev14qc,1580241076.0,"I would ask your doctor if it's possible to examine your growth plates through a x-ray. By 18 most males should have stopped growing, although I have heard some stories of some males growing in their early twenties, but no later than that. If your growth plates are closed, there's little to no chance of you growing taller, save for your spine. If your plates are still open, I would recommend keep doing what you're doing as far a sports and eating. Just make sure to keep eating right and to sleep as much as you can."
