relationship_advice,fqqltzf,t1_fqobut7,1589567775.0,"Gosh, it varied. I embellished and exaggerated stories a lot, which I assumed everyone did (and I know a lot do), so I never thought of that as lying, just making for a more amusing story. 

Other times I would fabricate an experience altogether. Those lies were usually in an attempt to relate to someone else and their experiences...which, clearly, is fucked up because how can I relate to an experience I haven't had? I guess I justified it to myself because it was usually when the other person was struggling with something, so I wasn't ""lying,"" I was ""helping,"" right? And I was creating a closer relationship with the person in the process, which was what I wanted more than anything (because obviously the way to create a deep, solid friendship is to start with a lie). Sorry if this is senseless, I've never tried to explain it before and I'm struggling to find the right words.

I also told ""white lies."" All day, every day. About nothing. I learned early (my mother is a master manipulator) and I thought that was just how things work. I know, I was 40 years old before I was diagnosed, and at that age I sincerely believed that most grown adults lied regularly throughout their day, for any and all reasons, and that it was just part of adult interaction. Again, I didn't consider it lying, it was as natural to me as breathing; I just never really questioned it.

When I started therapy for BPD and needed to keep a daily log of my symptoms and behaviors, when I saw a column for ""Lying"" I was like ""is that a thing?""  But suddenly I was aware of it. I had to mark it down every day. And I realized how much I was doing it; I couldn't keep track of how many times in order to check it off on my log each day. I would ask my therapist ""Is [blank] lying?"" and she would nearly laugh at me for asking such obvious questions. I had justified and denied it my whole life."
