Which might also be why she might be eating to fast, so getting a unique feeding bowl (A puzzle bowl) something that will make her work for her food slow down her eating can prevent her from puking it up again. It will also stimulate her in a very positive way seeing as cats like this kind of stuff, even if they will be confused and maybe a bit annoyed at the beginning that they can't just goulp down the food.  


Also changing a cat's brand or type of food will cause irregularities, for people it is best to have a varied food but that is not the case for cats, specially with cat foods which is a kind of superfood for cats. Best to stay to 1 brand they like and is good for them.  


An easy way to check if it's good quality of cat food is to check on the back. The first ingredient listed should be some kind of Protein Ie: Chicken, fish.. Now it should just say ""Chicken"" or ""Fish"" not ""Fish protein"" or ""Chicken meal"" or anything else. Just purely the word of the protein. This insure that 1: That will be the main ingredient of the food and 2: That it's not just garbage leftover of the meat, like the thing they can't sell.

So currently, in out timeline, we can project our thoughts on to a TV screen. Imagine the implications of being able to send a particle through time, specifically backwards. Our brain works on these electrical impulses, imagine being able to change someones brain cells by modifying their electrical impulses, as they do scientific discoveries, back in time? I am not even talking about ""Mind control"" but more like butterfly effect.. What if scientist from the future could help scientists from the past understand concept far beyond their timeline? Imagine how quick things could change..

There is a certain amount of years (So people say) that we could possible jump into the future before we straight up died from brain shock over the differences in technology and how the world works. But what if you could get people used to it slowly, through.. Oh idk, predictive programming? Showing it on tv, series and fiction, getting the brain used to the idea.

Wouldn't we technically be able to go a bit further back every year with our scientific advantages, thus bringing future tech a step closer to now tech every step of the way? The year we discovered time travel would technically be the year we could know every single piece of knowledge from all of future humankind.

Would also make sense with these ""Alternate timelines"". Because we didn't have this shit in some timelines...

What might cause fucking issues is the imbalance of matter and antimatter since you would be removing matter from one timeline and adding it unto another. But assuming the universe is able to solve paradoxes, which I kinda think it is, I just don't think we understand the paradoxes well enough, it might not be the worst.. It might be a ""Golden age"" but transitional. Maybe the reason mental health is in such a big decline has something to do with all the information we are getting that we shouldn't really be getting at this point and our mind has a difficult time catching up.

In the world of the insane, only the crazy man is sane.

And we really do live in the world of the insane. Because people who suffer do Mal-adapt only because Mal adapting is the only real response to a world where a ""Healthy"" mind is considered outrageous.

Psychology I don't really have as much an issue with, as it at least deal with the thoughts on a human level, not just stamping them  as ""Sick"".

Psychiatry is bullshit and only there to turn people against each other.

Ever wondered why the people who suffer most are most prone to having the ""Antisocial disorders"" that are so hated by modern society? Like sociopathy. It's because you hurt when you suffer and you find a ""Mal adaptive"" way to survive the pain. Mal adaptive being anything that isn't just ""Sucking it up and accepting you are a slave""   


And it works.. It turns friends and family against you under the ruse that those people can't think straight.. When everyone turns on you for voicing opinions that aren't in line with what society wants, you will slowly loose more of your ""sanity"" isolating yourself, thus furthering the distance between how ""Normal society"" and you think. It's a self-regulatory system and effectively shuts down any idea of different thinking. If anyone have any doubts about the dystopian society we look at, just look into the history of psychiatry and realize how much freedom we actually have.  


Realize that every ""Symptom"" of a disorder is distress over society and that any symptom can be put on any disorder which is why we have this anger against ""Self diagnosing"". Because there is no illness,  just a ""cure"" an effective booth to put you in to shut down whatever you might have to say about a certain issue. And the ONLY test is the personal belief of whatever fallible human is treating you. No real test, just an opinion that they have learned to spout decided on what you are saying and how that might be an issue for a well formed slave society.

They will usually always offer the cheapest version of it.  


If you need to go to the hospital, even with an ambulance, you will not be billed.   


If you need to stay in the hospital for 10 days, you will not be billed.  


If you have dentist issues, you will be billed quite heftily. If you need anything with eyesight, the same. Your own pocket. any ""Specialist"" is out of your own pocket unless it is emergencies..  


So it's kinda the same issue but on a not quite as lethal scale."

Second of all, you think white people don't get killed by people, get poor education and live in poverty? No? you know they do, and for a lot of other reasons than ""Being black"" yeah but you don't realize you are screaming at the white man in the ""Same boat"" as you instead of the one actually dishing out these injustices this creating more hate for everyone, black AND white people.

Watching youtube and reading newspaper does not legitimize SHIT for me. I know what I have experienced ""As a privileged white little girl in the slums"" and that was racism FROM black people. Now that stuck with me enough that I felt prejudiced for a long time until I realized that they probably experienced the exact same thing. And yeah growing up in primarily black school I can say ""I experienced being in the minority and I experienced racism"" as did the other white kids as that school.

But no.. I will never know what it's like being black and being called black slurs. But I know what it's like being white and called white slurs. Whatever you say about white people turn it around and if that shit is stuff you wouldn't wanna hear about it being said about black people because it's racist.. Chances are you are being fucking racist.

But yeah I am sure white little me had major ""White debt"" to pay off so that was justified. Right?"

Yeah I understand that the history of black racism is a lot larger, but we are writing history right now, and it's filled with racism against white people, whether you see it or not, just look at the original comment I posted on. You can say all you want that it's systemic, and you are probably very right that it is, but to say that someone else who get systematically oppressed for another reason they cannot help and should not be a negative could never understand how a black person being oppressed for something they cannot help and should not be a negative is just fucking insane. That is how empathy work. 

Yeah, it would be fine if that was what triggered you but it seems to trigger you that other could face systemic oppression too. Which is just a ploy from the higher ups too. DO you really think it helps anyone but your sense of personal social justice? Feel free to use this conversation."
LateStageCapitalism,ffilu7e,t1_ffi6x6p,1579976969.0,"I focus on it because any purpose of eliminating racism based on racism is going to fail.

I can give countless examples of ""Racism against whites"" but it looks the same as ""Racism against blacks"". When children are being bullied for being ""wiggers"" whenever an argument is dismissed due to ""White privilege"" whenever someone speaks of their misfortune and they are being told ""It's not so bad because they are white"". Whenever someones death is less important because of their skin color, whenever someone is told they, or they voice matters less because of skin color, whenever people are being targeted, because of their skin color. That is racism. And that is happening more and more to white people to the extend where its been normalized now for ""White racism"" because ""You can't be racist towards white people""..

Eliminate racism IN ALL FORMS. I don't get why that triggers you so much."
LateStageCapitalism,ffi21g4,t1_ffhu44w,1579962756.0,"I am not saying it does not exist. You don't know about my knowledge so refrain from commenting on it. Yes racism exist, and yes people are not colorblind but if you keep saying that ""one race is different"" than the other you are just perpetuating racism. Any difference there is is purely cultural. The amount of melanin in our body does nothing to change ""our race"". We are all one race, Humans.

Actually it is as simple as it sounds. Stand up to assholes and start treating people like they are people.

The fact that you don't know what racism towards white people is, tells me that you probably don't know what racism is."

That is why ""we"" are pointing out that when talking about racism and the issue, the ISSUE is DIVIDING BY RACE. Literally what racism is. And yeah, they SHOULD have realized that, which is probably why you should realize it as well.

And because anti-racism is usually just racism towards white people. That's what it is. No ""Anti-racism"" or ""Fragile white privilege"" 

Racism. That is what it is. And people who put forward these ideas try to hold some kind of moral high ground because ""Well slaves, so now you just have to take it"".
