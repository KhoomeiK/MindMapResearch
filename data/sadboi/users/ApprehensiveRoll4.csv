Wouldn’t recommend it though. I talked to someone on here and said he used DXM with success so I was intrigued, didn’t know anything about it. Lone behold, dosed up 6 days ago and woke up not withdrawing! It was so crazy. I woke up with some optimism for the day for the first time in probably a year. Ended up dosing once that day around 6pm but that was it. Did the same thing the following day and after that jumped CT. Bought a few other supps that maybe helped a little but that’s how I did it. 
*also note* I had some adderal I used to get me through the first couple days at work. It was really rough for 3 days but the 4th day I started to feel better. Lmk if you want to ask me any specific questions.
*disclaimer* I am not advising the use of DXM. I know it can be dangerous but if you do research and use it properly I believe it is a miracle to help quit. GOODLUCK TO YOU! Get your life back."

As far as the serotonin aspect, there’s definitely something to it. I’m hoping there’s not a rebound effect. Hopefully I find a balance where the now lack of exogenous serotonin stimulation is equaled out by the fact I’m suffering less from withdrawals. That’s in terms of just my overall well being."
