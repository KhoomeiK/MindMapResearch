I tried watching Fox news the other day and couldn’t last more than 5 minutes. Seems like we all have different realities now. Either left or right. Depends on what the algorithm thinks we like. News is just targeted ads now. That said, Americans cling onto their pre-existing beliefs more than ever. The same goes with their political preference. Anything can be denied. Conclusions can come out of thin air. The truth doesn’t matter that much anymore. It’s scary because I know I’m not an outsider observing this phenomenon. I’m also a part of it."

You gotta be able to stop clinging to those standards, look past some stuff and just choose the lesser two evils. Or it may never happen at all. I think this is the only explanation why there are so many people out there getting married while we here look at people and don’t see one worth liking (quoted There Will Be Blood).
