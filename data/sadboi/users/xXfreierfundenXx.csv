BPD,foqcc4c,t3_g8w2vt,1587989967.0,"I can relate.. I could have written that^^ 
But I also have advice. What helped me was writing down what I wanted to say. I made a list with all the things he did or said that made me feel bad and described how they made me feel. Then I sat down and rewrote the list trying to write it in a way that wasn't just blaming him for making me feel bad but understanding that he didn't maliciously try to hurt me. 
Something along the lines of ""I understand that for this might just have been a random comment and that from an outer perspective it doesn't seem important, but for me it was very hurtful because of x, y, z"". I also told him that sometimes I feel like I have to ask ""do you love me"" and explained that I didn't ask to start an argument but because I wasn't feeling good about myself. Explaining that helped preventing a lot of stress and made him response in a a lot more caring way. 
Maybe you can give it a try :)"
BPD,foqayd5,t3_g8ys89,1587988831.0,"This sounds sooo familiar. 
First of all, there is no need for you to feel unlovable or any of these things. 
Second: lockdown is a tough situation for all of us, being together without enough space and no room to be on your own can make people think funny things. Especially for couples it's a challenge. Try to communicate about you feelings and fears. Don't put pressure on him, try to understand his perspective and give each of you enough room to breathe. 
I assume you are both quite young? 
My personal experience is that moving together too soon can be a fatal mistake. 
For your own good wait until you know the relationship is as stable as possible and (even more important) make sure you are not depending on your boyfriend. BPD relationships are fragile, in case something goes wrong you have to be able to take care of yourself without your boyfriend. If you want to move in with him so soon anyway, then pls talk about each others boundaries first. Talk about skills that help you cope with arguments, agree on communication rules and think about what each of you needs to feel comfortable and how you want to prevent arguments."
