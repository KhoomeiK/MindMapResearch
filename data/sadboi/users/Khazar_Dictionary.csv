Fascist Italy created concentration camps in Libya with more than 100.000 inmates and the horrid treatment of their population caused over 80.000 deaths. 

Italians were relatively mild in Eritrea - as mild as a colonial occupation can be - but were barbaric in occupied Ethiopia. After an assassination attempt to the Italian vice Roy in Ethiopia the fascists massacrad all the monks of the monastery of Debre Libanos and unleashed the black shirts on Addis Abeba, destroying the town and killing over 30.000 Ethiopians. 

Immediately after the joint occupation with Germany, the Italian government ordered the execution 11.000 Greek civilians and treated Greece as its stomping ground. As a direct consequence of joint Italian and German occupation, 300.000 Greeks died in the famine of 1941-44. 

While at the beginning Mussolini was hesitant to deport the Jews or impose discriminatory measures, as his regime approached Nazi germany, he was directly responsible in ordering the deportation of the Jewish population of Italy and Libya - 8.000 Jews murdered in Italy, several other thousand in Libya sent to labour and concentration camps in the middle of the fucking Sahara, left to rot, starve and die.

Mussolini is depicted as a ‚Äúless aggressive‚Äù than Hitler but could be a butcher to any group that defied its reign, much more with colonial subjects. So fuck him, no tears for this monster."

Chile - In genera I thought that people were also very polite, but the Spanish was incomprehensible. I expected Santiago to be a more developed city than t actually was, with many parts just looking derelict. The food didn‚Äôt impress me.

Bolivia - The country looks like something out of this world. Potosi feels like a RPG city. Buses were not near as bad as I was expecting. People kept A LOT to themselves. Saw a lot of people with underground metal T shirts which impressed me, lol, I even saw a random graffiti that just said ‚ÄúMars Volta + Tool‚Äù. Country is ridiculously cheap.

Peru - People also keep a lot to themselves, but they are more approachable than in Bolivia. I wasn‚Äôt very impressed by the food either. I didn‚Äôt feel super safe in the country, comparing with Chile and Bolivia that are really safe for Latin standards. But the country has impressive culture and even more impressive scenery. 

Equador - I only stayed two days in Quito, but I was surprised by how more developed it was then what I was expecting. I‚Äôm ashamed to say I expected a much poorer country than what I saw - you could drive and not see a slum, at least not as the ones I see in Rio.  I hung around this shopping mall that was mostly goth/rock memorabilia and geeky stuff? So I don‚Äôt think I got a very representative view of the country.

Colombia - My favourite latin country. People are EXTREMELY nice and they feel genuinely happy that you‚Äôre interested in their culture and country, not for Narco or FARC shit but really to experience what the country has to offer. Almost all museums were free, quality of transportation great, food was mental and Cartagena is honesty one of the most beautiful cities I‚Äôve ever been. But mostly, it was the genuine warmth of the people that sold it for me.

Costa Rica - Lived there for a year...country is middle class but had horrendous infra-structure. Blackouts were constant, water cuts as well. It pours during half of the year and during the other half is dry. Tourism wise, I feel that the neighbours are much more interesting. Also, there‚Äôs a strong bureaucratic culture there. But now that I‚Äôve shat a lot on Costa Tica, let me say I genuinely enjoyed my time there and sometimes feel myself missing the parties at the UCR...

Nicaragua - Managua is so weird. It feels like downtown was destroyed in the 70s and nobody cared about rebuilding it...very depopulated city as well. However outside of Managua the country is beautiful, specially Ometepe island. No as have a strong rivalry with Costa Rica, they kept asking why I didn‚Äôt left Costa Rica and moved there. They were easier going people as well, but the country was sadly very poor. 

Guatemala - My second favorite country in Latin America. Such a small country with so much to offer. Climbing the main temple in Tikal and just staying there with nature surrounding you is an experience that I would really recommend anyone to experience. People are so nice as well. I was surprised by how many people living traditional lifestyles you could find meet walking around. 

Mexico - I certain need to return to Mexico, I stayed there 3 weeks and I don‚Äôt feel I barely scratched this amazing country. Chiapas is completely different from Guanajuato, and Mexico City easily rivals any great city in the world. So much to see, so much to do. If you offered me to move to DF now I would - making good money of course. Best food from wherever I was. It feels much more developed than Brazil in some parts. People are much more open minded as well, at least people that you randomly meet in the street. Sadly, I was robbed by policemen there and due to the fact that I am intensely white, I could understand sales people openly discussing about scamming me, while thinking I could not speak Spanish.
