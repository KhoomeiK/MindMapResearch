I think it’s also just really simplistic verbiage that gets the point across in a powerful way. And it’s less obviously cult-y. Family doesn’t sound cultish. But if it was called The Purveyors of Light and Love, or some shit like that, it would be more obvious to the victim that they’re involved in something beyond a group of likeminded people. The language is “safe”.  It took me two years of being out of that to even realize that it was a cult at all. Because it was all super subtle. And presented to me as absolute truth. We were told we were important and special and gifted. I believed every word."

Rumination being labeled psychosomatic ruined her chance to get help. 
I actually found it interesting how many people were angered by a psychosomatic label in general. Just because it’s caused by the mind, doesn’t mean it’s not real. I have so much body pain, migraines, dizziness, etc caused by my ptsd. That doesn’t mean it’s not real. Just means that the body and mind are not separate entities."
