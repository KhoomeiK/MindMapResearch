Really well supported club, and they were very welcoming to us Blues. They did really well last year getting to the German Cup semi-final, but they've had a ton of injuries this year and they're 4 points from safety.

[Here's a little diagram I made](https://i.imgur.com/cJaVER2.jpg) that shows the origin of the shot and the area covered. L is the Lowry Theatre, the circular building at the front of the shot on the right, the O is the old bridge in the distance, B is the blue BUPA building to the left of the bridge that's quite new, and A is the missing bridge with the Alchemist building on it.
