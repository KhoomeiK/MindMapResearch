sociopath,f20wrh2,t3_dbbgm9,1569865016.0,"I believe wonen tend to be less impulsive and are more likely to use finesse/manipulation, as opposed to brute force or intimidation, to get what is desired."
sociopath,f20vr5t,t3_d82um5,1569864681.0,I can definitely relate. And I’m not trying to be edgy. As for people saying it’s anxiety... it doesn’t make sense to me. Those daydreams make me excited.

police,f1bqmqc,t1_f18xu55,1569340762.0,"You’re right, deadbolts don’t really make it harder to pick. They are more about resisting kicking or using a credit card to slide in and raise the bolt. It depends on what kind of lock you have though how easy it is to pick, for example how many pins it has. The motion detector could be a good idea. You could also consider purchasing a camera for the front door.

Edit: as for explaining what happened, I don’t believe this was an accident. It sounds like a creep. There are some weird people out there."
police,f1bpih7,t3_d8ifi2,1569340036.0,"Is there anyone who could have some extra keys from your house or is your lock easy to lockpick? If so, change your locks. Consider getting a camera for outside of your house.
Next time a car follows you, if you are not alone, get close enough to take a picture of it. Make sure you see the license plate. If you are alone, do not engage.
If the calls keep coming, change your phone number."
