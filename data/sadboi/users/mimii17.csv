kaisamains,exoe7j6,t3_cttw2f,1566474914.0,"I think freezin is a good way to keep the enemy adc away from minions, but first of all you need a support who never bother your minions which is almost impossible. Poke supports hit them with their spells, some idiots hit them by aa just for fun (?). So commonly you can’t freeze the bot lane no matter what adc you play."
