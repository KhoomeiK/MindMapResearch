Breadit,fn1bvod,t1_fn1aiqm,1586558823.0,"That pizza is the most popular. There's awesome contrast between the acidity of the goat cheese, the sweetness of the apples and honey, the tartness of the apples, and the umami of the onions and rosemary. A lot of people also like to add bacon, giving contrast to the texture as well. Creamy cheese and crispy bacon. The bacon also adds to the savoury flavors."
Breadit,fn1bk1o,t1_fn1aiqm,1586558639.0,"I can't think of the brand, but it's a 50/50 mozz provalone mixture. Only our margarita gets the straight chunks of fresh mozz."
Breadit,fn1be3v,t1_fn19sio,1586558545.0,"Their sauce seems like it'd drip off. One of my coworkers and other people like extra sauce. Most prefer it to be just enough to keep the pizza from being dry. The prosciutto is tall in a couple of places, which will make it slip and slide around. Like when taking a bite, it'll bring the whole piece with it. If they would have cut it into smaller pieces, it'd be easier to eat, but not nearly as pretty. This was probably chosen to be more photogenic, and this pizza is very photogenic. A lot of contrast in colors and textures. Honestly, no solid complaints, just preference."
Breadit,fn0t1qz,t1_fn0rngf,1586548191.0,"Funny enough, my place is a craft pizza joint, so yes! Lots of interesting combos. Some of my favorites:

White sauce, mozz, provalone, asiago, goat cheese, bree, granny smith apple slices, sauteed white onions, and rosemary. Cook it up. Garnish with honey and parsley.

Red or white sauce, mozz, red onions, sun dried tomatoes, sausaged tossed in maple syrup, smoked cheddar cheese, and lots of oregano. Fire it. No garnish. 

Red sauce, mozz, bacon, sauteed white onion, gorgonzola crumble, rosemary. Fire it. Garnish with a balsamic glaze.

Breadit,fn0qo0z,t3_fyke5x,1586546911.0,"I work at a brick oven pizza place.

That dough is perfect in every way. Stretched perfectly (left the edges puffy). Cooked evenly and very hot. I'm guessing 700+ Fahrenheit. It'll be crunchy and chewy. IMO too much sauce and too many toppings. They avoided amature mistakes, though. The toppings aren't pilled in the center, they reach all the way to the crust.
