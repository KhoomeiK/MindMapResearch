They had a spouse they couldn't even remember meeting. It was fucked up. That was a particularly extreme example I'm sure, but it's a possibility. Both of these people felt they were not made aware of this possibility first (altho idk how the second determined that considering they couldn't remember either way), and felt their doctors were suspicious of them reporting this as a side effect at all. The first person I think found it somewhat helpful? I don't remember well tbh. The second was still struggling hard after, but I imagine that was part because their case was so severe, and part because they suddenly lost fucking years of their life.

Also my grandad has had it a bunch of times, it worked great, but it was for schizophrenia (he's...hard to understand most of the time anyway, so no idea if it affected his memory).

Survivors are often aware that confronting an abuser has no positive effect because the abuser simply continues to act manipulatively and lie, but it can have a negative effect because the abuser takes it out on their partner for making them look bad. So the best option is often to go directly to the partner. Whether it's something or nothing, this will just be one piece of many, for the partner to figure out on their own. Which she did.

I think NAH. Assuming there's nothing else going on that isn't mentioned here, the friend probably overreacted or overthought it a bit, but not hugely. This one comment alone won't damage the relationship, it's only informing her of a possible pattern. OP probably overreacted too, if they're yelling at her and freaking out over it, rather than calmly talking it out with her like so many in this thread expect of her. But again it's not in a huge way, so whatever. Cool off and talk it out. If this is the only thing she's done like this, find out why, be a friend and listen.

Disagree on the teenage bit though; I think mainstream society for some reason loves to play up how moody teenagers are, but I really don't think it's that normal. Some mood swings, maybe, but not horrible and not long. Assuming baseline""should"" be unstable or angry or something seems kinda ridiculous. And I suspect many of our parents had legit mental health problems they learned to repress or drink away unproductively but it's become normal for them so they assume it's normal for everyone.

 HOWEVER, most of the types of drugs used for mood, have a different effect on teenagers than adults biologically. And it's already hard to predict how they'll work on adults, it's literally just trial and error. So that sucks but hopefully it'll work out soon and you find a good one... Or you go back to one that was tolerable, and learn to work on it from there, like you said.

 It sounds like maybe you and your mom disagree on what therapy/psychiatry is supposed to look like, and it might be hard to communicate that (threatening to fake symptoms btw is not necessarily effective communication for her). Maybe ask your psychiatrist to talk to her about it, or find some articles to share about it, so it comes from a source she sees as more authoritative/experienced. Good luck with everything."

Chattanooga,fkvuacr,t1_fkrsqef,1584576861.0,">keep in mind which country is responsible for this pandemic as well as many previous ones

China isn't ""responsible"" for creating the pandemic. They definitely didn't handle it early on as well as they could have, but honestly they're handling better than we are right now. Pandemics are just part of life on Earth unfortunately. China is statistically more likely to be the point of origin simply by way of having literally 1/6 of the entire world population; it's a loaded die."

Haven't y'all seen the sti awareness kids in college wearing a normal sized condom on their head like a hat? They're made to stretch. Even *if* his penis is that big, he's wasting money on those things. Maybe present it like that? Bc NAH if you try to tell him nicely (you'd be an asshole if you think he's putting people at risk and don't tell him)."

askscience,fkt1rx1,t1_fkszneo,1584503868.0,"Geez now you mention it I just heard that from my neighbor. She had explained it as ""mild"" meaning anything from asymptomatic to pneumonia, with organ failure classifying it as severe. She's not a medical professional, I just like her and forgot to fact check. I'm falling for the same thing that's been frustrating me lol.

tldr: nope don't have a source"
