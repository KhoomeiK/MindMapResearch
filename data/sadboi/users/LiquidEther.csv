If the memory is never moved into long-term storage, that is an encoding problem and it simply doesn't exist in your brain.

If something goes wrong with the storage (analogous to corrupt hard drives on your computer), that's another way you could lose your memory. Important to note that we distort our memories all the time, losing details and sometimes even fabricating new ones.

And finally, you could have stored memories that you are having trouble accessing (like when you have a word on the tip of your tongue that you never manage to find again). That's a retrieval error, and corresponds to the scenario where a memory is lost but technically still stored."

You will meet new people. And you will lose them. That's just something you will have to come to terms with, although I know it's hard, I still struggle with it.

And yet there's also nothing wrong with craving community and connection and intimacy - there are base needs for social creatures, this is what our brains are wired to seek.

How come Heaven doesn't have overpopulation problems?) The show itself doesn't do a lot of moralizing and seems to agree with your point on how sin is defined. I mean, we are rooting for the literal Princess of Hell, so who really are our sympathies being directed towards? Not towards devotion to God, that's for sure..."
GradSchool,facta14,t3_e8k8lm,1575946509.0,I'm so sorry.
depression_help,fac1anf,t3_e8guyh,1575931992.0,PhD students working long hours are working ineffectively. You're paralyzed because you're putting too much pressure on yourself.
depression_help,fa8yiq1,t1_fa8xuyu,1575857846.0,"On a superficial level, I follow r/Aww and I enjoy cute animals. More personally, success at work, or friends when I'm not feeling too disconnected. 

You?"
depression_help,fa8xswg,t3_e81dzd,1575857344.0,"I can't promise friendship or that I won't disappear one day, but if you want to talk just for a bit that I could do."
depression_help,fa8xnoq,t3_e81t3t,1575857242.0,"Hey, I could listen for a bit. I can't promise you a lot of time (I struggle with abandonment so I'm careful not to commit to more than I can handle) but we could exchange a couple of messages tomorrow."
history,fa8gm69,t1_fa8fwur,1575845941.0,Yep. 'Greece' come from a Latin word; the Greeks called their land 'Hellas' so 'Hellenistic' is just the adjective form of that.
HazbinHotel,fa8fvbi,t1_fa8fo3u,1575845666.0,"I have mixed feeling on the sound effects - on the one hand, it's overwhelming, but on the other hand I've grown fond of it and it's just a part of the show's style for me now. I wouldn't mind if they toned it down just a *little* bit though."
HazbinHotel,fa7nx3h,t1_fa7bltu,1575836537.0,"Yeah, it's a show built for the internet age - this frame by frame discussion is exactly what they wanted. The show does toe the line on sensory overload, but overall I think it does a fine job at being coherent enough on first watch, and better when picked apart for slower digestion."
Android,fa72jsl,t1_fa71vz3,1575830809.0,That makes sense. I guess I'm just used to my setup where I have cables at all of my desks (cables are also cheap!) so I plug my phone in whenever I sit down at my usual spots.
freefolk,fa6ngwy,t1_fa6grqj,1575826477.0,I see you also appreciated Lindsay Ellis' takes. Honestly the community response to Season 8 was the only thing that made the experience bearable.
Android,fa5lu19,t3_e7rbf7,1575816192.0,"Can someone who prefers wireless charging over cables explain the appeal? I get why you might want to use your phone to charge your earbuds when there's no power sources or cables around, but why get a wireless charger for your phone?"
depression_help,fa0jqxe,t3_e7k7yc,1575756050.0,"I'm sorry you're struggling with this too. I also moved just over a year ago, and while I don't regret the move cause it was objectively the best decision for my career, it's made me realize that the feelings of loneliness and inadequacy stem from inside me rather than from my external circumstances - no amount of moving or meeting new people helps all that much. That's a tough thing to come to terms with."
