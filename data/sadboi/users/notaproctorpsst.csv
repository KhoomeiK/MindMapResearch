mentalhealth,fq6d4hd,t3_gh15og,1589129211.0,"Hi Janet! (I'll call you by your username if that's okay)  
28f here.

I am so, so sorry this happened to you. I read your other posts and it must feel heartbreaking and lonely to not have your parents on your team. It's so brave of you to open up to your mother about this, and I'm sorry that she didn't acknowledge what happened to you. It's difficult to not be able to get safety and reassurance from our caretakers, and even more when it's about a traumatic experience. 

It's good to see that you talked to friends about this, and I hope you keep in touch with them about how you feel. If ever your friends are at their emotional/mental capacity to process this, I'll gladly lend you an open ear.

I imagine it's disappointing, hurtful and disheartening to have your mother dismiss you like this, and even shifting the blame to you for it. It's perfectly understandable and fair to want support and sympathy. If you Mom so blatantly refuses to give you what you deserve, it's more than fair to protect yourself. Take all the time you need. I do suggest not simply shutting her out though, as that probably won't solve the problem that you two seem to have. It's possible that she just has a very different view of the world and will never understand, but I think it's worth a shot to try. You could, when you feel ready for it, tell her how her dismissal made you feel. You could try expressing the reach of her dismissal, that you feel left alone, that it was a leap of faith for you to even tell her at all. If she still reacts with dismissal, then it might be worth considering other options. If you can, stay with a different family member or with a trusted friend for a while so you can process."

I’ve always been more taken by women than men. Back in highschool I would literally follow girls with my eyes and be unable to take my eyes off them. Guys were not as interesting. I prefer a man as a life partner, but I am definitely sexually attracted to women as well. 

That being said, my taste in porn varies too. For the longest time I thought I didn’t like porn, but a while ago I figured out that I simply have to be turned on by both the guy AND the woman in the video. Which is, if I may say, pretty hard to find, PLUS the right kind of porn, huhhhh. 

Anyway, there are times when I concentrate more on the women or even watch FF porn, and other times where I’ll be more about what the men do and look like. Sexuality isn’t binary and linear and doesn’t have to be. Just enjoy whatever gets you going :)"

relationships,fja3ori,t3_fcbihj,1583165721.0,"It may help to give him a better idea of what your day will look like preemptively. Like ""Hey good morning! I'm about to head off for work, going to grab lunch with a colleague. I also have some meetings throughout the day... do you want to \[insert call, text, hang out, etc\] at Time X?"".

I'm in a long-distance relationship, so communication is a big topic in my relationship. If you don't have secure attachment (see ""attachment theory"") or abandonment issues it can be upsetting if the person you trust is unavailable. In those cases it might help to know beforehand that somebody won't be available.

I do feel that in this area, understanding and empathy are a good approach, but also it's not okay that he gets passive-aggressive/immature about it when you don't reply. You won't be able to always tell him every step you take, and you also don't want to start feeling controlled. He needs to learn to express his fears and emotions more maturely, i.e. ""I feel very anxious right now and need some reassurance that I'm still important to you. I know you're busy right now, and I know I'm being irrational, but I would appreciate if you could call me/get back to me when you're available again.""

It's probable that he has specific things that he is insecure about, i.e. things that he feels are more important to you than him. Maybe from a rational POV, he knows that he's important, but those feelings can be strong. It's worth finding out what his triggers are and then it's on him to work on those issues, with your support and maybe a shift in how you guys communicate plans and availability. Therapy is always a great starting point to sort these things out.

Wish you the best!"

* my employer says I should stay home 14 days at least and get tested for Corona
* the local hospital says I won't be tested unless I pay the 160 euros for the test myself
* the RKI updates their website saying people who have been in an area with growing numbers of cases should also be run through diagnostics
* the local medical officer says I should call my GP and ask for differential diagnostics, including influenza and corona virus
* my GP says I cannot come into their practice because they are not equipped, I should go to the hospital instead. I need a sick note for my work, GP says the hospital can give me that
* the hospital says ""your case isn't a serious case, go to your GP"", I tell them that both my GP and the medical officer say I should be diagnosed, hospital says ""we don't have time today, come by tomorrow, and we can't give you a sick note""
* calling back the GP, they don't know how they should give me a sick note, tell me to call my health insurance so they fax something to the GP so that the GP can prepare the sick note, to finish it once I've been to the hospital the next day
* health insurance denies faxing anything for data protection reasons

My ex was emotionally abusive too. Not in the same way, but my behaviour was similar, and there were some incidents with him that involved him trying to secretly be friends with girls instead of being normal about it. 

I've been in therapy for a year now and have made great progress together with my current bf. For him, jealousy is actually a trigger, so it was quite the unfortunate combination, but we both knew we just had sore spots. 

I'm always for communicating and being on the same team. You're obviously struggling with this, you're not happy feeling like this either and you want this gone from your relationship. What helped me was the realization that your feelings aren't about HIM. You would feel upset with your next boyfriend too, should your relationship break because of your feelings, and with the boyfriend after that, etc.  
I communicated with my bf and told him straight that it's an issue that I have, that I know it's about my own mind and not what he's doing. I told him the background story of how my ex made these things come up in the first place. Told him it's not an excuse, just to give him some background, and told him that I would need to ask a bunch of questions and that he shouldn't take these as jealousy, but as my way of easing my mind and slowly getting to understanding. 

You say yourself that you're lacking understanding for why he HAS to keep those friends around. If you feel confused or insecure about certain friendships, ask him for a sitdown where you can just ask questions that would make you feel safer with their friendship. Not ""are you attracted to her"" or things like that, but more ""how did you guys meet"", ""what would you usually talk about"", try to understand their relationship for understanding's sake. Jealousy can be very difficult for the ""target"" partner to deal with, so it's super important that you're both aware of it and have a lot of understanding and patience with each other. Don't let the fear take over. You got this."

Dogtraining,f7z1qyf,t3_dxy1b3,1574104000.0,"Hey there! I totally get you. I have had some trouble with my dog in the past too. It feels shattering to have your dog be aggressive towards you and it shakes your trust. But really, it was just a situation that was too much for the both of you - your dog is likely as confused by you as you are by him. 

What happened is a combination of a few things. Every dog has a different level of frustration tolerance. By the back and forth with him, his ability to tolerate shrunk more and more, while his frustration rose. That he bit you was solely based in this one situation of escalation! I know it doesn’t help now, but the course of action in a case like this would be to remove the stressor (ie the food) instead of asking your dog for something that he can’t handle, apparently. Again, every dog has their limit at a different point, and in different situations. Frustration tolerance can be trained, but from what you described, any dog would have had a really hard time dealing with it. 

I also strongly recommend feeding them separately and thus manage the problem instead of solving it, as I don’t think this is something that you should waste ressources on training. You can feed your dogs separately. Don’t make more work for yourself than need be. 

Try to find some trust into your dog again. This situation could happen to anyone! He did a great job by warning you first. He growled, he even jumped, and only after your aggression, he escalated. If something like this happens again, it’s always better to deflect and change the course and location than further escalate. If he jumps at you, instead of smacking him hold your hand down and lure him to get back on the ground. 
And get that bite checked out!"

Generally it helps me to break the more overwhelming symptoms down into ""see, this is your mind doing this, this is this common process, this is this common reaction that your body displays"".

It also makes a lot of sense. I bottle up my feelings a lot because usually i'm just overwhelmed and don't know how to respond, or even if I do anxiety keeps me from doing it. Like, I might feel overwhelmed in a room full of people, but I won't see a chance to get away for long enough to calm down, so I sit there and hope it gets better instead of communicating what's up and just dealing with people thinking I'm a bit weird.

Thanks so much, really! I saved your replies for later use :)"

mentalhealth,f7ogff7,t1_f7o2jb9,1573927022.0,">""Where in your body do you feel this emotion?""

Thank you so much! I usually am quite aware of what I feel and where, but I'm lacking ideas on how to process it. (Social) anxiety often manifests in my stomach, eyes and arms/hands, to the point where I might dissociate a bit, my vision will numb/zoom out and I won't feel my hands as part of me. I know where I feel it when it happens, but so far I just haven't understood how to counteract these things as usually first it hits my thoughts and then my body starts feeling weird. 

So taking the stomach/vision/hands thing, what would be the thing to do there, just generally speaking? So like, lock my hands together to feel them, or find a spot to close my eyes, or do focussed breathing through the stomach? I don't mean as a direct guideline for me, more so I can understand the process and sense in this mind-body connection process."

LongDistance,euh322j,t3_cgccry,1563819913.0,"Man, I (28f) feel you. I've been exclusively LDR with my bf for almost two years now. Did it before with an ex, also two years. Same conclusion: LDR sucks.

I was very young when I had my first LDR, but I can reflect a lot more now and I feel like what you describe is a common problem in LDRs. Once you get to see the real person, it's hard to merge the two images of the online personality and the live personality. I am very analytical when it's about psychology, and I found that a lot of the problems you could encounter in a LDR boil down to different attachment styles. Basically, as soon as you're not both equally securely attached, you'll have a discrepancy in either of the partners feeling appreciated. By what you say about how your gf needs those little crumbs throughout the day, I'd say she's more anxiously attached than you are. That's me in my LDR. I want intimacy, and I want the same level of intimacy when I'm not physically with my bf. But duh: it's impossible.   
Tbh, I don't like my bf as the person I'm texting with. He doesn't spend the time to read his texts before sending, sends typos, asks questions and then puts away his phone, so conversations drag out. He doesn't invest as much in the distance as I do. But, again, different attachment styles. Whenever I get frustrated with his lack of investment, I remind myself of who he is when I'm with him. Of the person behind the screen. I don't always feel like texting with him because it can be exhausting, but I do it anyway and I'm nice in doing so, because I know it's hard for him too - just that he finds his coping in distracting himself more and keeping himself more busy.

It helped me a lot to acknowledge that. I'm still falling back in old patterns, but it gets easier once you acknowledge that you guys do have a separate life when you're apart. Go back to being appreciative of every little sign of life you get from the other person, instead of waiting and hoping for more and more. Make plans to see each other, and save your asking for attention for then. Until then, concentrate on giving, and try not to fall into a pattern of expecting or demanding. Long-distance is hard for both of you, even if you cope differently."
BDSMAdvice,euh1mr1,t3_cgdrd0,1563819162.0,"Apart from the usual green, yellow, red, we also have a safe word for ""I need a quick timeout"" that's independent from the sexual act.

Tell him what you're saying here. How happy you were when he did text you, that you're thinking about him and want him to have a good time, but that you also miss him and are sad because you'd love to hear about how he's doing, especially since he told you he would do a quick check-in everyday."

relationship_advice,ess0y5y,t3_c8zmoq,1562242382.0,"Heya! Ex cam girl here. 

In my time as a cam girl, I learned a lot about ""that world"". One thing most of all: being a cam girl is a job. You're nice to the people who follow you, you have your cam girl separate life, but it's a job. It's industry. You're nice and welcomingto your followers. I knew quite a bit about a few people, personal information such as their place of work etc, because you're there (half-)naked doing something that is usually very intimate, and the people watching feel that intimacy even though it's just an act. If you ask me, most of my followers were pretty naive and playing a dangerous game. I could have easily blackmailed a bunch of them or destroyed their life if I had wanted to. 

That being said: If he follows a cam girl, it's the same as following a celebrity or a porn star, just that a cam girl does her marketing through direct interaction. But it's an ACT. If the salesperson at the car company is being nice to you, they don't do it because they like you, but because they want you to buy a car off them. 

I get that it might make you feel insecure and hurt. If you feel hurt, tell him that. You can't forbid someone from using porn, but you can communicate if it impacts your relationship (i.e. you feeling less appreciated/valued). If he doesn't want to change his habits, you can't make him and have to decide yourself what you will do with that."
mentalhealth,esmiq8u,t3_c8fk3l,1562106512.0,"Wow, we're basically congruent. 

1. I started to go run. And for half a year, I really needed it. I'd wake up in the morning and would HAVE to get up and blow off some steam while running

2. No drinking if I have to get anything done the next day, unless I have somebody around who I know can prevent the low. 

3. No drug use of any kind. 

4. Admitting feelings I have for what they are without judgement. Then look for the source and/or ""what would need to happen for this situation to become ideal?"". That question is really helpful because it tricks you into imagining the best outcome and then concentrating on ""how could i get there"", instead of focussing on what's horrible about it. 

5. Writing out whatever irrational thought I have, and adding sticker notes to what I write and feel would be particularly telling/important to bring up in therapy. That made me go from just getting it out for the sake of it vs. getting it out to approach it from a more therapeutic POV. It makes it important to actually write down the irrational parts so I can bring it to therapy, and by that, it makes me allow the thoughts with less judgement because something productive will come from them after all.
Allowing them to come and pass is so important because if you repress them, they'll become stronger until you deal
with them, plus you'll feel bad for having them.

polyamory,esjwyg3,t1_esjo8yt,1562044264.0,"I definitely agree. I've hinted at it in the other thread. I think by not being honest about who he is and what he needs, he's doing both himself and his SO a disservice.

If you haven't talked about it, I think it's high time you should. Whether that results in a break-up or you sticking together, you'll save both of you a lot of time and/or heartbreak. And maybe it'll be a nice takeaway for future relationships to bring things up when they arise, and not wait until you're knee-deep in an issue that'll just get harder and harder to adress."

Anxiety,er7zvw2,t3_c0t422,1560592317.0,"Don't beat yourself up over wanting sex with your boyfriend. Seriously. It sucks for him that he was uncomfortable, but you can't read his mind. And him acting like he did want sex makes it impossible for you to pick up non-verbal cues. So seriously: He should have told you he was uncomfortable. He should have communicated that he wants to wait, or what's keeping him from trying. I get that it's an awkward thing to bring up and he probably didn't want to hurt you, but he has to be honest. Communication is everything.

You're not gross for wanting sex. Your sexual drive is healthy and valid. 

For the anxiety part... I am absolutely ashamed of even feeling anxious in public. I hide everything because I want to keep up the facade. So I get you. I've been a lot better in the past few months, so this is less of an issue now, and by now I know that if I feel the onset of an attack, I will leave the situation as gracefully as possible, but definitely leave.

To sum it up: Don't base your self-worth on him!! You're not gross. Sex isn't gross. Wanting sex isn't gross. I suggest to try reclaiming your sexuality a bit, be proud of yourself, ENJOY yourself. It's amazing that you are so big on communication and I really hope you keep that quality. There are plenty of people out there who are just as smart and loving as you :)"
mentalhealth,er7yqqb,t3_c0tqey,1560591465.0,"Generally, there are two ways of dealing with problematic behaviours in yourself or others:

1. Management. With management, you do what you need to do to get through a problematic situation. If you forgot to pay a bill, you get extra fees for being late. Management would be to pay the bill including the fees to avoid the situation from getting worse.
2. Training/Learning. That means you do things to PREVENT a problematic situation from happening. For the bill example, that would be to set up a reminder system to pay bills right away when you get them, or to teach yourself not to just put the letter you got just anywhere, but to a dedicated spot that you sift through once a week. You change your own behaviour. You act instead of reacting.

So, with that in mind: Friends are usually great for venting, or for getting immediate advice when you don't know what to do. But talking to a friend will always only be management.

Therapy is there to actually get to the roots of a problem. Take low self-worth. The problems resulting from this manifest waaay down the line: you might feel neglected by friends, feel like you're too much, be jealous. Those are the problems that you'd usually be trying to take care of, one by one. Therapy looks at those problems, and then gets to the root of it. Those individual problems are just symptoms of an underlying cause. That was just an example; there are other problems you might be having that you don't even know have their root in a different, deeper issue.

I like that you said you're very aware of your problems. I've felt the very same way and still do. I'm great at picking apart what kind of irrational thoughts I'm having, but the emotions will still be there and poke me. Therapy makes me understand a lot more about the underlying causes of those thoughts, and it makes it a lot easier when you can ascribe certain feelings to the root of the problem, instead of just feeling inferior, guilty or pressured (because ""this shouldn't bother me"") for feeling the way you feel."
relationships,er6julf,t3_c0j40u,1560549433.0,"Before judging any of this, I feel there are a few questions that need to be asked first.

Have you two ever defined what you are to each other? Boyfriend/girlfriend? Casual?

Have you talked about how serious you are about it? Do both (!) of you see this as a long-term commitment or more as something nice on the side? No judgement here - both are completely valid, but it has to be figured out at some point and rather sooner than later so nobody gets hurt more than they need to.

Have you talked about whether you want kids or not? Marriage? (Those are all good things to bring up in order to spark a ""Oh. I don't see us in a relationship like \*that\*"")

&#x200B;

From how it reads, to me it doesn't seem entirely clear if she sees you as that serious of a significant other as you see her. She is also a few years older than you, which might (before our 30s) still impact your relationship greatly. The brain still shifts and grows up until you're about 25. You start to understand yourself and know yourself better more and more the closer you get to 30.

I'm a strong proponent of believing that people aren't inherently bad, so I'd rather like to believe that your problems stem from some unresolved communication."
