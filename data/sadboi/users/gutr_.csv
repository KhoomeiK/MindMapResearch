> just use regular PIR presence detection 

Gonna research about that.

>1. Only works if you'll be scanning the rfid at each place you go. 

Would it be a problem? (asking out of ignorance, don't know to much about rfid)

>2. You can create geofence and only use your phone if you get clear GPS readings 

Would it work to map inside of an apartment? Will research about it too.

>3.  Pir sensors 

Will research this one better too. Probably there is PIR sensor with different ranges out there to buy right? Because I would need one with small range.

Between Geofences and PIR sensors, what would you guys suggest, taking into consideration precision."
