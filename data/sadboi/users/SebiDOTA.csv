The fact that almost every new account playing dota starts with ""I have already played Dota 2 before"" combined with valve's incoherent patch policy comprises an obstacle for those not dedicating an hour or so each day to the game. I know many players that simply and literally forgot about the game because they couldn't keep up with the changes while they are busy with work. Yet the 3k mmr brain redditors put the blame on aforementioned fact that, there are no new player accounts, focusing on a problem that is not fixable; instead of one that is, because that would imply actually putting effort forward to making the game better instead of ranting. You are a prime example of that. If you want to get anywhere, stop blaming others, and fix the problem instead of falling to some tartuffery that offers an excruciating piece over the struggle that is change."

As for the suggestions, the methanol option is most realistic to me since it is not known to kill very quickly (would have to do some googling though to get a good idea of time-to-ld50). As for the other suggestions, ricin kills in days and is poorly absorbed orally, nerve agents kill quickly (<15 min) unless very diluted in which case there'd still be a lot of symptoms way before one dies, and they're also not easy to make. Carfentanyl is so toxic that it basically \*is\* a chemical warfare agent (a lot more toxic than VX I believe); I doubt it kills slowly because Fentanyl is known to be one of the fastest killers on the drug market. Radiation-poisoning (e.g. Po-210) is likely, too, not a good option since the ""death in 2 days""-formula would mean that ppl would show severe symptoms in the hours following ingestion. Cyanide poisonings are almost always either 1) Quick and Fatal 2) Non-fatal with relatively low side-effects."

toxicology,fms9wwo,t1_fms8me6,1586350690.0,"I get your point. On the bright side, phosgene oxime (Cl2CNOH, the compound in question) is a solid at normal temperatures, whereas HCN is a gas long before that. Additionally, I doubt that phosgene-oxime is as toxic as phosgene because of its high solubility in water: The reason why phosgene is so toxic is that it has very *low* solubility, advancing further into the respiratory tract where it can cause alveolar damage later. Overall, given that phosgene-oxime causes immediate irritation whereas HCN has no warning signs; if the compound doesn't possess toxicity very similar to phosgene (which I doubt it does), my risk assessment given the information available on the internet would favor it over HCN."
