insomnia,fmdpsxw,t3_freovt,1585974298.0,"They’ll stop working any time now. Benzo tolerance is INSANE. Once you’ve taken them long enough, you become physically dependent. Benzo withdrawal is one of the only detoxes that can actually kill you. Once you decide to get off of them, life becomes a literal hell for months. I never abused my Klonopin, but I was forced to stop it for a while. During that time I had such bad anxiety that I couldn’t (and didn’t) leave my house for six months. I had a complete psychotic meltdown to boot. Point being, the good effects you’re feeling right now are only going to last so long and then you’ll pay for it ten fold. That’s my experience and warning to you.

Now, Klonopin has a stupidly long half-life. It’s like 24-30 hours long. I find that if I take one on Monday, I can still get enough out of it on Tuesday night to at least make sleep a little easier. If possible, use it selectively. Take it when you absolutely must, take it every other day at times when you think you could make that extra mileage work and MOST IMPORTANTLY: DO NOT TAKE IT ON THE DAYS YOU DON’T NEED IT. If you’re off work on the weekends, it’s better to just suffer and stay up all night when you can afford to. Anything to keep distance between you and that drug.

Lastly, Klonopin has this bizarre, sobering effect. Well after you think you’ve actually felt the effects of it is when you’ll actually reach peak blood levels. You’ll still be majorly impaired even when you feel like the medication has worn off. That being said, you can and will get a DUI driving on it, or worse, wind up in an accident. Hypothetically, let’s say .5mg of Klonopin is the equivalent of being over the legal limit with alcohol. If you take 2mg of Klonopin at night, then go to drive the next day, you’ve still got at least 1mg of Klonopin in your system. PLAN ACCORDINGLY IF YOU HAVE TO DRIVE because you will not have the ability to determine whether or not you should. Nobody told me that when I first started Klonopin. If they had, I wouldn’t have totaled two cars in two months. 

Overall, it’s a helpful med, but it will fuck up your entire life if you don’t treat it very, very, very, very carefully."

That being said, I did a lot of research after this happened. As I mentioned in another reply here, there are many different manifestations of sleep paralysis. While many people are unable to move, there are some people that can move but simply can’t speak. Those aren’t the only manifestations, either. The tingling/numbness is also a common symptom of sleep paralysis. After hours of reading, I feel extremely confident that it was indeed SP. Text doesn’t convey tone so let me make clear: I absolutely do not mean this in a condescending way, but you should read some articles on it! Again, not discrediting you in any way, but there was a lot of surprising information. I always thought that the only experience people had was the one you hear the most: not being able to move, feeling of someone sitting on your chest, possibly seeing some kind of person/monster/demon. I found our that it’s super different for everyone! 

As for being able to grab my phone, I must not have included this thought in my original post. My only explanation for that is that I was fighting so hard. I was definitely still unable to speak and in an abnormal state. It was the most difficult task ever. I just *barely* was able to do it and then I was back to a place where I had no control again. I’m 100% certain I was in fight or flight, so maybe it was just a crazy amount of adrenaline? I don’t know. I’d certainly love to see some research on people that are able to recognize or even control it. I do know a friend that is able to stop it somehow. It’s all just weird."
Sleepparalysis,fjvu0bs,t1_fjq4vjm,1583631071.0,"I actually did a TON of research on it and there’s several different manifestations of sleep paralysis.

Sometimes it depends on whether it’s happening to you while falling asleep or while waking up. The tingling/numbness are also a very common symptom among other things.

When you think about the big picture, it certainly seems exhausting and not worth it. However, I’m certain you can look back and think of at least a few memories that were good. Those are what make it worth it to keep pushing. Also, mental health isn’t a death sentence. You will have to push yourself and put in hard work every day, but if you do that, you’ll build yourself a life worth living. I’m the same age as you and have also struggled with mental health my whole life. I’m posting this as I’m finally on the upswing of crippling depression and anxiety that was so bad I couldn’t leave my house for months. Nothing has changed as far as my situation, but I’m feeling better. The key to it is acceptance. Pain+resistance=misery. Accepting things the way they are does NOT mean that you agree with them, but rather that you understand you may not have control over some things at all times. 

Another thing that helped me a lot was some advice my therapist gave me. In my head, I had this idea that not being mentally ill and being happy meant that every day was exciting and fulfilling. That’s not the case for anyone. Everyone has bad or uneventful days. Learning to say, “I did enough just for today,” helps you understand that a bad day isn’t a pattern. If you wake up and all you do is shower, and you start to feel guilty about it-think about it. You’ve got the rest of your entire life to have a better day. Sometimes you have the power to make tomorrow better, sometimes you don’t. All you can do is the best you can and accept it. It DOES get better. Hang in there."
Advice,fiqwj07,t3_f99ng8,1582652917.0,"As much as it sounds like you should, you’d be crossing a boundary that’s really important. They don’t need to know you struggle to trust that you can help them. However, if they know you struggle, you then become one of them and lose credibility in being someone that can help. I’ve worked in mental health for years, and as hard as it is, it’s the best route to take. There are ways you can vaguely let them know you understand without flat out telling them. That’s the happy medium that helped me be a better helper."
Advice,fiqvzvv,t3_f97liu,1582652661.0,"I’ve worked in mental health for several years now and I feel pretty comfortable saying that’s schizophrenia. Psychosis is different. Usually psychotic people wouldn’t be able to be on Reddit asking for help in a rational manner. Schizophrenia sounds terrifying and like a death sentence, but it’s absolutely not at all. You 1,000% need to see a psychiatrist as soon as possible. Starting to treat and understand it early will help you cope better with it. There are so many people out there that simply take a pill once a day and they’re back to functioning the way that they always have. Please don’t blow this off as something supernatural. It might make you avoid getting the help you really need. Most importantly, just know that if diagnosed with schizophrenia, you’re not alone and it’s perfectly manageable. It gets blown out of proportion by the movies and media. I’m sorry you’re struggling right now, but help is out there!"
Advice,fiquvuq,t3_f9bs72,1582652113.0,"This has been happening to me for so long. I learned about Chronic Fatigue Syndrome a few months back and it makes SO much sense with how I’m feeling. You should look into it, but unfortunately it’s not really something that can be diagnosed with certainty and there’s no cure for it. However, there are support groups to learn how to cope with it better. In the meantime, I would suggest getting bloodwork done with your doctor to rule out anything like hypothyroidism and then maybe check with a psychiatrist to see if there’s medication to help you sleep better. I just kind of accepted that I need ten hours to sleep to function and I plan my day around it. It seems to have helped a lot."

However, any friend that would ask you to lie to police isn’t a good friend. Look how stressed you are over this. Is anyone worth feeling that way? If I were you, I would let your friend know that maybe you care about them, but that was a one time deal. Also, if your friend can get you to lie to police, they aren’t going to stop there. You’re showing them that you’re willing to do the favors they’re asking you to do, even if it’s something serious. I guarantee you’re going to find yourself in a similar situation again if you don’t set a boundary. I know it’s easier said than done, but it sounds like you need to phase that person out of your life until they get on the same healthier track that you are. 

Also, major props for choosing not to get sucked in to drugs and risky behavior. That’s a really hard choice to make and even harder to actually do. Make sure you pat yourself on the back for that."
Advice,fiqsuit,t3_f9979z,1582651117.0,"That’s kind of how jobs are supposed to make you feel. It’s not right at all. For example, I work in healthcare and they make such a big fuss about not coming in when you’re sick because you could spread it throughout the hospital. However, whenever you call off, they seek to contradict themselves and fuss even more. Employers want productivity. They’ll push you until you feel exactly how you’re feeling now-guilty for simply taking care of yourself. You have nothing to feel guilty about.

However, I have a couple pieces of advice. Try not to call out for anxiety as much as you can. With anxiety, the more we avoid the things that make us anxious, the more we learn that simply avoiding those things fixes the problem. Then it starts to become a pattern and you trap yourself in it. What helps me is knowing that I can leave my job at any time if my anxiety is too bad. I can simply tell them I’m sick and I need to go. If you can just get yourself to show up, most likely you’ll arrive to find that you feel better anyway. Plus, it looks better to employers if you can show that you did try to come in and do your best. As far as calling off three times while being so new, I do think it’s important that you give your boss or HR an explanation. You don’t have to tell them that it’s anxiety, but you can just tell them you’re struggling with personal or medical issues. Make sure you let them know how important the job is to you and how you’re committed to being a good employee. Just give them a heads up that you might need a little slack until this resolves. If they are very understanding, again I can’t stress enough the importance of not taking that opportunity to avoid going to work. Push as hard as you can through that anxiety and it will start to go away every time you complete a shift that you thought you couldn’t do."
Advice,fiqrry0,t3_f9b0ey,1582650580.0,"Up until I was fourteen, I had a horrible systemic allergy to nickel. I used to be covered in rashes (and when I say covered, I mean it was even on my eyelids). The rashes would often scab up or pus and people thought it was pretty disgusting. I was never a super confident kid, but I knew that my skin wasn’t anything I could ever change so I just decided one day that I had to accept it. Whenever people would ask about it, I would just educate them on what it was. Once people understood, they seemed a lot less judgmental. I’m assuming you have at least one friend that doesn’t care about your skin, right? So, remember that there are still people out there that will like you no matter what. Sorry for the cheese, but if you’re beautiful on the inside, you really do become beautiful on the outside. When you accept what you’re living with, you start to feel confident and free. When you’re free, your personality grows and grows and people get drawn in by your charm, not the way you look. Using humor was always a huge help for me. Being able to laugh with the people that mocked me was a hard skill to learn, but they suddenly didn’t mock me so much when they saw I wasn’t affected by it. Acceptance isn’t something that happens overnight, but what you can do immediately is stop wearing your hats. Just do it. Take the plunge. Spend time out and about being unapologetically yourself. Take note of the people that are kind to you throughout the day, starting with the cashier at the grocery store or whatever. Really pay attention to see that so many people will treat you just the same. Hope that helps, and I wish the best for you!"
Advice,fiqquti,t3_f9b3vh,1582650034.0,"There’s probably two ways to explain it. Assuming you’re a woman, so many of us have that maternal instinct to take care of the people we know are broken or “just misunderstood.” We have this overwhelming desire to and belief that we can “fix” people. Most of the time, we try to do that subconsciously. You cannot fix anyone, and trying only leads to your suffering.

Second, we all seek validation. You know that he’s not complimenting you all the time or acknowledging your strengths. Again, subconsciously, that can drive us nuts. We seek to have everyone’s approval because for most of us it’s hard to give it to ourselves. The more invalidating a person is, the more we try to seek it to prove to ourselves that we’re good enough even for the people that seem to dislike everyone."

That being said, you’re at a wonderful age where you’re able to determine what you’re going to be for the rest of your life.

Advice,fiqpfea,t3_f9bslo,1582649200.0,"This is a weird situation. I had it happen to me and I searched the house like the authorities search a house during a drug raid. I swear on my life, those keys were not in my house. I had left them in the door and someone took them. So of course, I called a locksmith and had all my locks changed. About two weeks later, I found the keys. It’s weird because you should take the time to search for them, but also it’s not like you have time to waste when there’s a potential for someone to break in. I’m not sure how close you are to a Home Depot or something of the like, but you can buy your own new door handles with keys and replace them yourself. It might be worth the trip if you could have someone house sit for however long you’d need for the trip. It was way cheaper than the locksmith and is what I ended up doing the second time I lost my keys."

The only thing I have is that I can tap out at any time, but once I do that, that bridge is burned forever. Unfortunately, at this event, the best sleep you can hope for is about four hours a night. It has always been exhausting. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that in the entire industry of performing arts, this is the most physically strenuous event in the WORLD to do. You push yourself through extreme heat, eighteen hour performances and four hours of sleep. There’s nothing I can do to prevent the toll it would take on me. At this point, it’s basically a question of whether I want to end my career with dignity by getting through it, or end it by tapping out."

cfs,fiqnx07,t1_fiqnldn,1582648308.0,"Oh, also my point in bringing up the art car is that I thought about emailing her and saying that I have medical issues, and I know I can’t choose my role, but could you make an exception and let me be an art car driver? If it were anyone else but me the answer would be yes. For me I have a 40% chance yes, 60% no, and that’s if she’s in a good mood. It’s not totally out of the question, but slim. The last show I did with her, she actually sat down and talked to me. I told her my body is failing me and asked her how she knew she was done dancing. She told me that I probably still have several more years in me and was weirdly encouraging (seriously, this woman has historically been horrific to me, though). I’m just so confused."

With this show, you’re not allowed to choose your role. You’re also not allowed to perform if you’re not physically up to it. My boss makes all sorts of exceptions for her “favorites,” but she hates me and definitely wouldn’t be understanding. There is a role that involves driving an art car around that would be probably the only thing I could handle. The only thing is, auditions for the year are coming up and I have to decide whether or not to go. My friend suggested emailing my boss BEFORE auditions to let her know what’s up, but if I do that it basically makes me like a horse with a broken leg-you’re cut. The point of emailing her before is to save the money on travel and lodging for the audition (it’s states away). However, if I email her and she says I can’t audition, then I’m out for the entire season, which makes me nervous because then I would be barred from performing the events that I might actually be able to do (a one day show on stilts is an example of something I might be able to push through maybe two or three more times). It’s such a confusing, sticky situation. Since you’re a performer and know how it goes, and now that you have this specific information-what would you do? Email before or after audition?"

Luckily, nobody would be relying on me physically. One of the number one rules we have is to never tap out. Never once in ten years have I ever done so. This will probably be the year that I do, but luckily it’s not like burning that bridge would be too bad since I don’t plan on going back. Also, there’s always about twenty alternates ready to replace performers at any given time, so I wouldn’t ruin the show. The “director” has hated me and been passive aggressive towards me for about 7 years now anyway, so I don’t really care what she thinks. This would all be for me.

I’m going to go out on a limb and say he’s probably not Brad Pitt (or whichever celebrity crush you have) attractive. But you’re with him because you love him. You love him for who he is, and you find him even more physically attractive than any other man because of that love. You can still think Brad Pitt is ridiculously sexy, and still want your boyfriend at the end of the day. It’s natural for humans to look at other humans sexually. My point is basically: there are probably men that you fantasize about but you would never compare them to your man or wish he was them. The same goes for your boyfriend. He loves you for you.

Advice,fhn4o3q,t3_f3uy6v,1581721935.0,"It’s a cognitive distortion. The best way to get rid of these thoughts is to continually tell yourself the opposite. It’s absolutely going to feel stupid and like you’re lying to yourself for a while, but trust me, it eventually becomes habit. When you approach a social situation, enter it non-judgmentally. Notice the thoughts of, “this is gonna suck,” or, “nobody’s going to like me.” Don’t listen to them, just notice them and let them pass. Every time something does go well for you, be sure to write it down and pat yourself on the back. Logging these things will give you a good list to look at when you’re not feeling confident and help remind you that there are situations in which you succeed and the next time shouldn’t be any different.
