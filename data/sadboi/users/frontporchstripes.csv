I've noticed the ones most accepting are the ones most self aware forgiving humble and willing to see from all sides... The ones that have been most unkind are the ones that have their own inner problems they kind of delude themselves in a way that they don't exist.. Kind of like a high horse mentality? 

I completely understand and have been in those shoes before because I did not want to see my own demons but let me say this whole experience has made me feel so much compassion and regret for every person Ive ever judged - one day they may too realize this.. One day maybe not

I was shocked - I've never stolen anything it hurt so much that he would assume that of me. I responded ""um no these are mine we all have matching ones.."" he seemed a little regretful but no apology. 
Perhaps I hold onto tiny hurts like this too much I mean I doubt he even remembers this interaction

The reason I wanted to separate had nothing to do with others it was because we got married at 21 and 23 because our son - I felt so much pressure that I was never good enough and after my brother died I felt life is too short to spend it with someone you don't feel loves you

I completely see his upset in this but not worth in my opinion completely putting me in a situation with no safety, food housing etc.

As the court dates approached I reached a point with the husband I was separating from that I truly deep in my heart let it go - all of it - I held my head high with confidence. I truly deeply believed and wanted us to drop it all and end this absurd war we created. 

All I'm saying is i believe that by surrendering to wanting goodness for all - believing deep inside me that peace would be the outcome. 
Feeling despite it all that I would leave that courtroom and see my ex as my friend not my enemy.. 
It was resolved where all chages were dropped - it has been expunged from my record (I have never had any record - this was from me slapping him after he said cruel things)

Anyway 

I hope this makes you feel less alone and that you can and you will overcome this and be better because of it! I will be thinking of you please keep us posted"

This is guilt that warps into a toxic emotion that will steal your joy and is NOT true. 

God, your loved ones or whatever you hold dear would wrap you up in a hug if they knew you felt this way - they would probably do anything possible to let you know just how loved worthy and beautiful you are.

This may not at all apply to you but this is something that I experienced and realized recently that has helped me a great deal.. 

I posted about it the other day I hope it helps you and I apologize if it doesn't resonate with your experience: 

My inability to forgive lead me here.. 

What if holding onto a victim mentality too long turns you into the ""villian""- 

I realized this the other day - for as long as I can remember I felt like a victim to the family I was born into (I had valid reasons to feel this way - verbal mental abuse and neglect) 

It took me until this year (30) and making and realizing my own terrible mistakes that all along I was using my ""victimhood"" mentality to not have to look at myself - to not hold myself accountable and to create a reality that fulfilled my own hungry ego. 

When I looked at the truth of who I was - who I had become - all my life holding onto this turned me into the villian in many others lives because I had not had the insight or courage to look at myself. I subconsciously just repeated the cycle because I wasn't ready to give up blaming everyone else. I wasn't ready to be responsible. 

I wanted to hold onto this hurt so that I didn't have to do the work. 

Instead of choosing my thoughts and reactions I went on auto pilot. 

I am finally doing ""the work"" and it hurts but it's real. I'm no longer in a false reality and finding I might be able to be in a place where I'm not constantly needed attention & validation - because hopefully I can grow to real self worth and inner -power security and peace"
spirituality,fpsp7t6,t1_fpqhmr4,1588877273.0,"It really is.. It's so sad because until you forgive and become aware of the cycle you are continuing by holding onto that pain - it will hurt others just like you were hurt.

spirituality,fpqbcg9,t3_gewzr8,1588819040.0,"Oh this is a mind bender that I often consider and I think it is extremely complex (or maybe simple depending on your perception) 

So each answer would have infinite possibilities of perceptions ""darkness"" depending on the vantage point the person is perceiving it. 

For example - your perspective on the music industry darkness of glitz glamour supporting materialism and sexual perversity another from different life experience or belief system may find it empowering or even hopeful to see potential for economic security and maybe even abundance. 

Even something that may seem universally accepted as ""goodness"" like altruism - has darkness. Many who ""give"" have alternate motives, use it to enhance ego self esteem or status. Some are ""givers"" because it makes themselves feel good and therefore can be considered a selfish motive.

I do feel guilt for the slap but I have never ever been ""abusive"" aside from that.. I also never ever intended it to go so badly and I feel guilt for how that has affected everything. 

Thanks for offering food for thought and taking the time to read / help"

relationship_advice,fpkw6rs,t1_fpkvcjr,1588702091.0,"Thank you so much for your feed back and help.. It was just so awful and I don't know how I will be able to recover. 

Of course there are three sides to every story mine his and the truth lies somewhere in the middle so of course I know this is just my perception and point of view.. 

I think I may also be wondering if I am wrong to believe this whole situation falls all on me.. It is so difficult to be the one blamed for every aspect and although I try so hard to make sure I am owning up to any wrong doing or hurt it has been so painful that he is made to be the good guy when from my experience so much of that situation was my reaction to a lot of difficulty he also put me through.. 

Is this wrong to think?"

bipolar,fpkgltw,t1_fpkbio0,1588694320.0,Absolutely agree with the ego things the thoughts would be things that I used to believe in manic episodes but now I don't know it would be comforting to feel like there is a spiritual reason behind it all though

bipolar,fpj23vh,t3_gdp8w3,1588654466.0,"I am so sorry I completely relate - coping is so hard keep trying - keep a journal and remind yourself of what you are grateful for every day. 

The best advice I've been given that brings me peace in low moments is - the past is gone no matter how good or bad it may have been. All you can do is try your best in every moment right now. The pain of the shame and the hurt you feel from it is so real and I still struggle but find any seed of hope you can within you. Forgive yourself and forgive others. 

If you keep torturing yourself for the things you cannot change it will help no one. You can do this.. Breathe and find little things right now you can appreciate in the room even a glass of water. 

Get out of your head - it gets too scary in there on your own with this disorder. 

My kids are all I'm living for too so I just cry when I need to and thank God I have them. I hope this helps in some small way - you are not alone"

Some days I self medicate with alcohol which is not the best but a few glasses of wine can get me out of my head - not saying I reckomend this it's just a coping mechanism along with some healthier ones like mindfulness and exercise

bipolar,fphtthw,t3_gdgajn,1588627684.0,"Wow girl I promise you I relate to every word of this post especially feeling like you don't deserve your husband.. If it makes you feel any better I have tried twice to separate from him during which I dated other people and half of his friends and family hate me and do not understand at all why we are together. 

When I am healthy we have a beautiful family and are wonderful together but I have had two episodes damage so many wonderful relationships we used to have. 

I question my whole life constantly and the only thing that gets me through is the support from him my in laws and my children. 

I understand this so much it makes me feel way less alone and wow I could go into more detail about how way worse I have been and how you are so deserving of his grace and love"

bipolar,fpdxrtj,t3_gcth5c,1588536363.0,"What a thoughtful loving daughter you are that you would reach out to understand her and make your relationship healthy üòä 
I personally have struggles with this in my family but I'm hoping that won't be the case as this is my first year medicated. 
I would say give her space when she needs it but also if she gets edgey or makes comments like that she is hurting and in her own head so much she likely isn't seeing how this is hurting you.. 

Just give her grace when you can but also set up healthy boundaries for your own mental well being 

I hope this helps"
