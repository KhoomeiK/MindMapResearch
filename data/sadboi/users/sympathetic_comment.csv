This is not to smear the word ""liberalism"" and it's pursuit of liberty, as many of the fear motivated peoples of this world are quick to do, but to emancipate your true purpose in this world. You know this to be true, because this is not how life is meant to be lived.


In America, there is a folk saying regarding the Golden rule of camping in nature, ""to leave your surroundings better than you found them."" And many amongst us try to follow this  adage to the fullest extent of its meaning and potential only to be disheartened by elder generation's unwillingness to confront that which makes them uncomfortable, that they were wrong. One could hardly blame them, after all, when they do hold themselves to have been the ""volunteer generation"" fueled by ""flower power"" and ""peace and love"" its hardly a message in its intent worth criticizing except for by only the most cynical amongst us. 


But the truth is, quite plainly, their movement failed. They failed to spur the revolution they had in mind to change the minds of many.  Undermined by fearful governments, fearful misguided followers of faith, or the debaucherous antics of they're own movement, the tidal wave of the culture failed to permeate all areas of the land, to sow the seeds of change in peace that they clamored so desperately for. The desperation of 


They had either only set the stage for what was to come only to cower in stage fright never to begin the play. Or, they had just loaded another bullet into the gun long pointed at their generation, while they awaited their turn to takeover and die as the gunman and not the one against the wall. Each round in that gun loaded today would be inevitably be pointed at future generations, their own children no less.


Whichever metaphor suits your fancy, take your pick. 


When it all came apart, the only thing to fill the void was the economic expectations for us who would come to follow. We were promised that if we spend a lifetime as a slave to the wages the powers that be do dictate as fair, then we too can escape the uncomfortable realities of life by excessive indulgence in creature comforts of exploitations. Allthewhile we must be padding the egos and pockets of a new aristocracy of owner and shareholder, to justify and enable psychopathy on a mass scale in the name of ""business."" If we do so, they promised, then we too may just have hope that we could be one of the select few to rise above the fray into society's upper crust, or at the least, escape the worst of poverty in a land of supposed abundance.


What good is technology's advancement in production if more and more become hungrier and more desperate by the day? Now you're asking the right questions. 


Babies will continue to come just as minds will continue to yearn for more knowledge.
Yet they've found ways to work the illusion of precious privilege into that as well, something so fundamentally universal and so human.


Right before our very eyes we've seen it all robbed away, bit by bit, and here you stand, awake for the first time, and found yourself at the same point so many of it's victims have encountered before. The bloodshed will not be televised nor will the revolution to stop it. It will be necessary to rid ourselves of the tyranny of a system fueled by greed and empty obligations to the selfish or long dead.


Each slice of the pie they remove for themselves is just less food for us all to fight over in the end. 


I want to remind you that this is not comfortable to read, not comfortable to realize and the fight is not going to be easy, but that does not mean it is not worth doing. 


I believe in you, as many others do.


Although their voices are muffled and near silent, you can be their amplifier or the shouter of a new message to scream and echo down the ages.

AskReddit,fkquxt3,t1_fkqrisc,1584456096.0,"Morals are personal values that one chooses to uphold no matter the difficulty of the task of doing so. Ethics are defined and differentiated when those morals cross the threshold to becoming action (or inaction).

I believe that as funeral directors along with providing cultural and religious final rites we have an ethical duty to be ministers of public health in whatever capacity that may shift into being. I'm aware that those who follow a particular leader of deathlings on YouTube would argue that a dead body is not contagious and 99 out of 100 times they would be right. But that creepy goth queen is flat out wrong in how she pushes that narrative and I can name half a dozen microbes which would love to have her over for lunch. 

But what deserves blowing the whistle on these directors I casually mentioned is that people are undoubtedly going to look to morticians for accurate and factual information regarding what may have killed their loved one. Not from a contagion standpoint of transmission from the deceased to the living but the living to the living. 

Let's say for instance that there is a stricter policy of social distancing in place, and funeral directors tell the grieving families that they're serving that it's okay to come in to make arrangements in person and have a gathering larger than county recommendations allow. 

Families in grief are not the best judges of right and wrong and need guidance, not to mention the fact that being in grief puts people at a higher risk because grief is immunocompromising. Without making concessions for such  circumstances (like a pandemic) they are knowingly putting people at risk (as a venue promoter or host to a venue) when they should've known better (regardless of the baseless opinion of whomever occupies the white house). Full well knowing that the bereaved are in a position of being disadvantaged in their mental facilities (as a regular, professional expectation) it seems to me like a lawyer could argue for a case of negligence under those conditions, wouldn't you agree?"

I've had nearly a lifetime of being told one thing by significant people in my life only to find out that they were signalling the opposite with unspoken cues. I have worked many years and s funeral director and have worked with many people in extreme emotional states. States that they don't have the capacity to hide the rawness of their emotions. I've either deprogrammed or lost that intuition of being able to read body language, tone, etc of people who aren't in the throngs of grief. Normally it wouldn't be so bad except for the reinforcing events and serial gaslighters who've come and gone through my life. 

So I have to play probabilistic thinking for what people's true intentions are behind their words, knowing that most people don't heal completely or healthily from their grief, and grief doesn't always involve death, I've found myself holding at least two or three possible outcomes of someone's implied meaning.

You're right to a degree, but the qualifier to that statement is that if he doesn't engage in the necessary work, then he'll repeat it over and over.  He's going to need to re-parent himself to unfuck that avoidant style of approaching conflict, because without it you, OP, are not going to be his lover, but his parent. It's highly personal therapeutic sessions and introspection that's going to have to take place, and while it can be aided by inclusion of a romantic parent as an adult, ultimately he needs to face it on his own. Be there as you can spare, but you need to be showing him and mostly yourself that both of your feelings, opinions, perceptions, and experiences matter, equally. Yes, equally. Because as someone who struggles with this personally, I don't value myself as I imagine your ex does something very similar to himself. He's going to need to learn how to be okay expressing his wants and desires from life, but he first needs to start with his needs being clearly expressed and respectfully received. Even if you two were both still together, you cannot take on the entire world's responsibility of being respectful to him when he learns how to be vocalizing his needs.

Granted, it's not going to be nearly as bad as the target the stream makes contact with either directly or by collateral spray, the effect of using mace at such a close proximity will be felt by you. The fumes and micro-droplets will become overwhelming quickly and if severe enough, may negate the advantage you would have had over your maced attacker. 

Main point is, to anyone carrying mace or planning to, when you find yourself in a situation warranting it's use, make plans to exit the vehicle ASAP after incapacitating the aggressor. Practice the self-defense mentality of placing emphasis on the follow through after using any force multiplers (i.e. weapons). If it's safe to do so, try your best to close your eyes the moment before engaging, best to cover them with your hand or another way of protecting your eyes. WHATEVER YOU DO, DONT TOUCH YOUR FACE AGAIN AFTER SPRAYING. Seriously, just don't.

Another note, check your local ordinances and state laws regarding the weapons classification of mace/pepper spray and the strength of the canister you intend to carry, if your area makes such a classifying distinction between differing strengths. Although perfect self defense sense as it only really makes sense having it be quickly  accessible, preferably in your person, that may be the same justification that police may use against you if you're pulled over and your vehicle is searched. It could result in something simple as a confiscation all the way to being placed under arrest if the cop happens to be an ass, having a bad week, is at the end of a long shift, has issues with racial differences, flat out doesn't like you, etc."

neuroscience,fb224xj,t1_fb1tcy6,1576444391.0,"In addressing the scale issue, it's explained, or rather, postulated by the Schrodinger's cat thought experiment.

Outside of the box, an observer's uncertainty of the quantum state of a particular particle triggers a condition for a larger observing system (next grander in the order of organization). That condition state evokes a reaction within that larger system, which satisfies another condition and again continuing so on and so forth, filtering through a however many number of systems until eventually, the cat is either dead or continues living unaffected. This is the proposed scaling of the effect of a singular quantum state's outcome having an effect that is observable by us without the aid of instrumentation.

To the outside of the box observer, assuming that the cat's death transmits no other information outside of the box than what was already it's constant and considered state (therefore of absolutely zero consequence), until there is an observation of the box's interior checking in on the cat, there is no meaningful difference. Meaningful here being defined as a means of having consequences (effect) on the larger system i.e. the universe. 

So if the box is truly considered wholely isolated from projecting influence and consequence outside it's constraints, then the only impact on the universe that is considered meaningful is the outcome of the observation. Based on our current understanding and capability to interpret quantum mechanics, it doesn't matter either way what's going on inside the box so it's entirely acceptable to assume that it's both dead and alive simultaneously, it's superposition of quantum mortality if you will. 

Where it all breaks down, and this is to lend credence to your point, having a coherent understanding of any mechanism's affect on the system above itself is where our logic breaks down. This is the decoherence observations of why we have different rules for classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. It's like tracing the lineage from the LUCA (last universal common ancestor) to today if the rules of evolution by means of natural selection were suddenly switched out and replaced by a completely different set of parameters. 

All in all, we have a lot to still discover and gain greater understanding about how our universe works. That's what I think is mostly Carroll's argument when he pulls the ""quantum indeterminacy card"". Until we're capable of radically different observations of the fundamental forces, just like the poor cat, there's no meaningful difference...yet.

As far as the emergence of consciousness goes, as time goes on and I learn more and more of the wave-particle duality and QM, I'm becoming more convinced of the possibility of the assertions of panpsychism. As woo as it initially sounds it chief claim is that consciousness is an inherent quality of matter/energy of our universe. It splints into different camps of whether as a fundamental force yet discovered or the yet to be known interactions between forces or something all together entirely different. The pet theory I personally like to believe is a combination of Dan Dennett's integral information theory and panpsychism, just that the information of Dennett's theory is actually a reasonable analog for a simpler conscious awareness, the experience of which we have no meaningful point of comparison to draw from.

Fun stuff to think about, shame that it's hard to have conversations like this amongst peers without them automatically thinking you're high or going insane."

ExNoContact,f98f7ez,t1_f978uik,1575177577.0,"The way you wrote this post it felt like I had personally had written it, the word choice was beyond accurate to describing my situation, my thoughts and how it kind of drove me nearly insane. 

 I just recently, last night actually, called her out went better than expected, felt good and like I didn't need resort to cruelty or pettiness or bitch behavior to do it. Here's the backstory:

My no contact period lasted nearly 8 months, after being dumped by the love of my life via text which bookended a six month period of subtly at first noticing that she was falling out of love with me and none of my efforts made any difference in the end. 

We've been in contact for about three months now and have had about a half dozen meet ups in that time, never once really getting far into the subject of the ""break-up"" conversation, either the one I was initially denied months ago, nor any sort of reconnection talk that wasn't heavily shrouded in ambiguity. Like yourself I wasn't given an honest and complete disclosure of what she felt like went wrong. 

(Stupidly) I went along with the being okay with the uncertainty and just prioritized having fun and spending some quality times together one on one or in small groups. So taking things slow, it was at the conclusion of the last time we met up that I had kissed her, she seemed to have been surprised but liked that I did. That was about a month ago, and I haven't been able to get her out since and her messages were a feeling progressively distant and cold with her showing interest less and less frequently. Even avoiding being the one to initiate conversation didn't seem to make a noticable difference when either she or I would reach out after a week or thereabouts passing (unusual). 

I finally got tired of feeling like it was all happening over again, and basically just decided that I'd had extended my patience beyond enough and that I wasn't going to tolerate a second round of that bullshit. 

After sending her a message of what I had already decided would be my last act of opening communication, We got to talking shortly after she responded and I got right to point of getting her out again. We scheduled a time to talk on the phone the next day, and I got right to the point of calling out that I've noticed her shift in her behavior and that if she's going to exit my life once again, without explanation, that I deserve to be respected enough to make the choice myself of how to feel knowing the truth. 

There's no need to get too into the details of the conversation but this part is worth mentioning: I calmly, flat out asked her what she wanted, after another wishy washy answer of maintaining contact in each other's lives and then she asked me what I wanted. I replied with showing no intention of just being her friend, that the way she left and has avoided acknowledging it doesn't grant her the privilege of being an awkward ""half broken up"" to ease whatever unresolved pain and emotions she may have about how it ended. 

I wasn't going to be another tally on her list of amicable exes just so she could maintain her combo streak of relationships. Her peace of mind in that regard was no longer my priority or concern and that I needed to assert myself to action to take care making my needs met prior to looking out for anybody else. 

One of my needs is that I don't want or need to be given dishonesty. End of story

She opened up after being taken aback, and we had a good, healthy, no bullshit but not too heavy talk. For a few moments it felt like we were back together and the past year was a bad dream. It was a good start, but now the dirty laundry has begun to be aired out, we'll see how it goes. 

I don't expect at first to get full disclosed honesty, nor do I need it. I've already questioned everything in the absence of having one thing, an answer. 

TLDR: 
When you lack answers, it takes away your power inner yourself. Only you can reempower yourself in the end, if you can do that, then lies won't matter, you're embodying your truth"
