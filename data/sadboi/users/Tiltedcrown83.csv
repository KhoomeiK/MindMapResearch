DAE,fpwapfm,t3_gfrjk0,1588960150.0,"OP, I didn't experience exactly what you went through but I sort of understand where you're coming from. 
I know the feeling when you find something you love to do and excel at only to have to put on the back burner for various reasons and now feel as though you're never going to be able to read or write like again, envision the words coming together so perfectly in your head.. you'd quickly jot them down for before the inspiration vanished.I miss that about writing where I could be anywhere at anytime when a sentence, part of a poem,etc would finally reveal itself especially after writer's block! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I can remember one of my elementary school teachers reading my poems to my class and telling me how talented I was.
I never received much attention at home,I was extremely shy and my self esteem was very low so, naturally I felt on top of the world when anyone noticed my writing.

 I had many journals and notebooks full of poetry..I continued writing until 19-20 that's when I started hanging with a rough crowd and over time became addicted to pain medication.
My use eventually spiralled out of control & I lost everything including all of my poetry and journals to add insult to injury I began having epileptic seizures in my 20's that combined with my opiate use impaired my cognitive abilities everything I had once learned in school is now difficult to remember...that once ""abundant river of words"" is now stagnate.
In some ways writing triggers shame in me as well,it reminds me of how much time I wasted,how much of a screw up I turned out to be.I'm extremely thankful to be over 3yrs sober 
I just wish I would've been smarter and went my own way instead of following what I thought was the cool crowd.

May I ask you why you feel so much shame within yourself because of your mother reading what you wrote? Did she read something taboo or private or is it because you feel like you let or are letting your parents down every time you start to read or write.
Do you feel any anxiety along with the shame and guilt? 
 
27 is still young you still have lots of time to get back on track if you can get past your inner turmoil. You sound like an incredibly smart and artistic person but we all only have so much time on this earth. 
I know your parents meant well for you at that time but now it's time for you to get back to your books and poetry!You can still have a job and write on the side but I understand that may not do you any good unless you get past the feelings that you're experiencing.

Naturally one might expect them to be screaming,crying or begging for mercy when faced with the inevitability of death but perhaps in some way,at that moment they welcomed it.
The constant physical and mental torture and the sheer depravity by the hands of the Nazis would've been more than I could ever bare so I can't say how I would react in that moment.I ask myself how anyone could have survived that but many did and went on to live fulfilling lives.


There aren't many survivors left and there are fears especially in the Jewish communities,that the Holocaust will be forgotten when the survivors aren't there,or that its lessons will be more difficult to teach. It reminds me of the quote ""Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it""


As you mentioned in your comment how you see a lack of humanity...I absolutely agree!
