LongDistance,estrox7,t3_c8fzq5,1562272483.0,"My boyfriend and I will have to wait 2 years (at the most) to meet. Neither of us wants to wait that long, but due to family circumstances and other reasons, we'll probably have to. We currently communicate a lot daily, and both of us have resigned ourselves to waiting and know that the other one is worth it. However, every relationship is different, so you have to decide how willing you are to wait and how much you want to be with the other person. Once you've established that, you just have to figure out ways to feel closer in the meantime. Hope that helps :))"
LongDistance,espjud5,t3_c88l75,1562185429.0,"My bf and I usually talk in the morning for me, which is evening for him, but sometimes if he's up early we'll talk in the evening for me. We're on a 10 hour time difference, but we'll also send each other texts, pictures of random things we encounter throughout our days, selfies, and Spotify songs that remind us of each other/that we want to share. It's really nice waking up to that. Sometimes when we call in the evening for him, we ""cuddle"" till he falls asleep, and then I go about my day and leave the call open. He loves waking up in the morning to me being there."
