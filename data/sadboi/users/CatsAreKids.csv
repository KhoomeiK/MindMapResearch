Either it isn’t available because their country lacks the proper resources, or a country *cough* US *cough* makes it impossible for people to get proper care because it’s so goddamn expensive.
People lose their houses, everything the have, because they owe $100,000+ that they don’t have because they needed medical care to save their lives.

I think this guy is isolating *himself* from the community, partly because of his obvious internalised homophobia and overall grumpy ass personality. 

You can’t be a dick to others and constantly hate on who you are and expect people to flock to you.

I wouldn’t want to date someone who was ashamed of their sexuality, that just spells a bad time in my book.

Hate yourself all you want bro, but don’t blame it on other gay men."
