Anxiety,fkumkpu,t3_fkq88w,1584552193.0,"Yes! I am worried about small business owners especially.

If anyone can, please purchase gift cards from local small business (local restaurants, hair stylists, esthetician’s, etc.) that you can use in the future and that might help small business owners to have cash flow now.

These are unprecedented times. And it’s scary. Let’s do what we can to band together."
Anxiety,fkc3pty,t1_fkbkur3,1584045189.0,"You can talk here on this subreddit and on this post. We are here to support each other through this. I’m sure you are already doing it. But take precautions with washing hands, avoiding large crowds if possible and try and stay safe. 

I understand how exhausting the fear can be. We are all here to help each other through this."
Anxiety,fkc3jsw,t1_fkbtj0i,1584045095.0,You are not alone!
Anxiety,fkc3hl5,t1_fkbkt4r,1584045060.0,It is very scary right now. I hope for the absolute best for your mother-in-law.  Do everything you can to keep her safe and healthy.
Anxiety,fkc3dof,t1_fkbezg5,1584044999.0,Yes. The fear of giving it to the vulnerable and older people in my family is so terrifying for me too.
Anxiety,fkbdmlc,t1_fkb519b,1584031052.0,"You will get through this. You have been through it before and gotten stronger because of it. It’s easy to feel helpless and controlled by the anxiety and the mental illness. Especially when there is so much going on, but you have made it out of dark times before! We will all support each other through this!"
Anxiety,fkau3xv,t1_fka3xzy,1584019502.0,"It’s a lot isn’t it? I understand that feeling of being close to that breaking point. It’s horrible. I hope for the absolute best for your family  in the UK. We all will be as careful as we can and hope for the best.
 
Stay strong."
Anxiety,fkatyx1,t1_fkabk30,1584019406.0,Stay strong! I hope everything works out okay with your dad.
Anxiety,fkatp8b,t1_fka4v2d,1584019219.0,"I so understand! I don’t want to keep reading everything but I also feel like I need to know. I also find it hard that other people in my daily life are still making light of the virus and not taking it very seriously. It’s really frustrating and scary. 

I hope your family in Asia are okay! Stay strong."
Anxiety,fk9wi1g,t1_fk9tohh,1583985319.0,"Absolutely valid. I’m not sure what country you are in, I hope there might be some support for people who are temporarily out of work. The emotional toll will be high."
Anxiety,fk9wfkh,t1_fk9ulxe,1583985269.0,That’s the hardest part for sure. We all will try and take all the precautions that we can. I have to hope for the best parts of humanity to come through and people to take precautions even if they are not high risk. To protect those that are. Stay strong.
Anxiety,fk9qvc3,t1_fk9ohrw,1583981549.0,"Yah it’s really not easy! There are 7 cases in my city and there was a rumor at work today that someone in the office building tested positive. I have no idea if that is true or not, I have been waiting for an email or company communication. 

My biggest fear is that I will get sick and then spread the virus to other people. The idea of being unintentionally responsible for hurting people is really really hard for me right now. 

Will continue to wash hands and try and take all precautions and just wait and see what happens. I have an appointment next Thursday with my therapist - would rather it be sooner but at least it’s booked!"
Anxiety,fk9ns2s,t3_fh86hm,1583979707.0,"It can be really hard to be in a relationship with someone struggling with anxiety. My fiancé can attest to that.  One of the things that he does for me is to hold my hands, sometimes he has to pry them apart or away from my chest when I’m really in a bad way, and he looks at me and says “I love you and everything is going to be alright”. He will repeat this calmly and slowly over and over.

Also trying to do slow deep breathing with her might help her calm herself physically and could be helpful. Acknowledging that her anxiety is okay and that it’s okay to be scared right now but reassuring that everything will be okay, even if we can’t see that now. 

I hope she is doing okay - I understand how scary things are right now. I’m feeling it a lot too."

CFL,f2o2aob,t1_f2o0amg,1570322200.0,On 2 And out podcast this week they mentioned that Harris has his own charity fundraiser. Which is why he is one of the only RBs not participating.
Enneagram,f1obh4n,t3_da9sfv,1569639961.0,I would also suggest reading about common mistyping. I personally found this helpful! [Enneagram Mistyping ](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/36-type-misidentifications)

Enneagram,f0ay6q3,t3_d48j3v,1568520255.0,"1. Yes insanely close with my mom - don’t know my father

2.  Reassurance from people I trust (select few). Familiarity and having information to deal with my ‘what if’ fears.

3. Looking stupid or doing the wrong thing - specifically being judged for doing the wrong thing. 

4. Yes about 5-6 very close relationships that I am super secure with, although I have ‘tested’ a lot of these relationships over time and it’s taken time to feel this secure. 

Goodluck :)

myfavoritemurder,erzm24s,t3_btys08,1561440809.0,"Got the book today (a little late I know)... my goodness it was incredible. It was so much more than I hoped it would be, and I had pretty high hopes. I so genuinely appreciated the realness and rawness of each chapter. I sobbed and laughed hysterically through the entire book, sometimes at the same time. 

Honestly it hit me in my feelings in so many wonderful and painful ways. Just wow. I’m so impressed with Karen and Georgia. And so grateful to them for being vulnerable."
