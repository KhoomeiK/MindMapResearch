Dominos,fjkz4zq,t1_fjf0z1e,1583436773.0,Look up the reviews for East Berry dominos in Fort Worth Texas. My store is located in (for lack of a better term) the ghetto where crime rate is pretty high and tips are scarce. They pay us drivers 10 an hour and $1 per delivery and even then we still can‚Äôt get drivers or keep drivers. And for the ones who do apply we turn away due to negative background checks.

modernwarfare,f7b2nt9,t1_f7b11ef,1573552399.0,I just find it funny that she has time to throw shit back and fuel the fire (the fire that they started mind you) instead of addressing issues even if she doesn‚Äôt know when it will be fixed. Right now I swear everything is falling on deaf ears.
modernwarfare,f7b1065,t3_dutxip,1573549720.0,Unpopular opinion: she is overly sensitive and will block you for almost any suggestion that doesn‚Äôt end in ‚Äúgreat job and keep up the good work!‚Äù Transparency is all I‚Äôm asking for instead of sweeping glaring problems under the rug.
