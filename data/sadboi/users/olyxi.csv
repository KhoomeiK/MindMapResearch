Putting guns in the hands of regular people is a stupid idea and there's a reason you Americans are the laughing stock of the world when it comes to gun related incidents. Its because whenever you have a mass shooting or something like it you lot just talk about god and send prayers to families, instead of talking about the necessary gun reform to prevent more incidents like that.

We've had one major mass shooting in a school, it was up in Scotland and we didn't sit around praying. We banned semiautomatic handguns over a certain calibre.

Now get off of your NRA high horse and see the light. The only thing your government wants from you other than your taxes to pay nessecities is your loyalty, let the professionals decide how to protect you.

The next person is this girl I have feelings for, she's been hit in the stomach and I try to stop the bleeding and I can't. She just looks at me and tells me it'll be okay she's just tired and she dies right there in the street. Then its her best friend, she's fine but she's hysterical so I ignore her and move to the next person. I get to the next person and roll them over and they have my face, I'm missing my left leg and my lower right arm is blown to pieces but I'm still alive, then I just ask myself why I couldn't save my friends. I usually wake up at that part but the odd time I don't I carry on down the street and find pieces of people all over the place.

Its a horrific experience but its one that I can't control  so I usually just tell myself its just a nightmare and go to sleep again."
