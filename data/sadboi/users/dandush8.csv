The other person who replied mentioned that we can’t change our name because of marriage anymore since it’s been so long, that we were supposed to do that when we received the marriage license. I just want to confirm that I understood you: we don’t need to go through the petition with the court using those forms and go through the hearing? We just go to the SS office? Sorry just trying to understand!"

Anxiety,ermo3nx,t1_ermgac0,1561031711.0,Suicidal ideation is a lot more common than people think. You are not alone. But I do hope that if it ever gets too intense you turn to someone for help. Feel free to reach out if you ever need ❤️
Anxiety,erlz1k0,t3_c2nh5g,1561000853.0,I feel suffocated by my anxiety. It consumes me to the point where I feel like my life is floating by and I’m too busy being anxious to truly enjoy any of it. My mind is constantly ruminating and latching on to something fucked and irrational to stress over. What’s worse is I don’t have sleep to look forward to given the intense nightmares I experience every night. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy
