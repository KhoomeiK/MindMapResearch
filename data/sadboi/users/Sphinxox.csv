AM - 
TO’s Natural moisturising factors + HA
TO’s Niacinamide 10% + zinc 1%
Spot treatment  - alternate every 2 days 
CeraVe am spf30 sunscreen 

PM - 
Alternate every 2 days between 

1. TO’s Salicylic acid 2% solution and TO’s Niacinamide 10% + zinc 1% 
 
And 

2. CeraVe foaming facial cleanser and CeraVe pm moisturiser 

Use TO’s AHA + BHA peeling Solution once a week;
use pm skincare routine number 2 when using the peeling solution.
Use CeraVe’s SA cleanser twice a week if it works well for you;
try not to use niacinamide or hyaluronic acid with the cleanser as it already contains both and might make the skin even more oily (I’m no dermatologist though)"

Without treatment bulimia can cause cardiac problems, ulcers, Boerhaave syndrome, your teeth could decay, you’re at risk for IBS, pancreatitis, diabetes, infertility, an electrolyte imbalance or a heart attack. Bulimia opens you up to the possibility of developing co-morbid (mental) illnesses including major depressive disorder, OCD, social phobia and GAD, to name a few. You might find it a blessing at the moment, the answer to all your problems but the deeper it sucks you in the more at risk you are of losing control, or so it feels.

Not everyone in an entire generation is the same and that goes for every generation. Becoming offended when someone swears at you in a video game is silly and I know some younger people will find it offensive but it seems more of a parental thing to get offended over something so minor as a curse word. Humour is subjective,  sarcasm and cursing can be taken differently depending on your culture but reacting badly to one of the 3 indicates your most likely highly sensitive, especially after something is explained to you. Most of the time when a person from a generation is offended it’s because of how dismissive another is of their opinion or feelings, no matter how real or imagined this dismissal is.

unpopularopinion,fpgr74v,t1_fpg969f,1588608026.0,"That may be true but that 1960s man could later go on to complain about the ‘ok boomer’ meme for being offensive. I’m not saying I agree with commenting ok boomer as a response to anyone’s opinion (no matter how condescending their comment may be) it’s just a wee bit stupid to be honest. What I’m getting at is the fact that someone may have reacted a certain way back then but that does not mean that today they don’t/wouldn’t react differently. An entire generation isn’t born offended or becomes that way overnight, those we grow up around have a play in how we react to certain situations. People now are more offended than in the 60s but when I say people I don’t just mean Gen z, I’m talking about every generation. Each generation has adapted differently to the 21st Century and offence is being found in every little thing but as all younger generations will experience with every change their generation brings there will be backlash. Most of that backlash comes from the older generations who disagree with the changes which were seemingly non existent while they were growing up or those in the younger generations who want the changes, who react negatively towards differing opinions. When people tear into these new ‘lifestyles’ using derogatory remarks it is expected that people get on the defence. However when someone gives constructive criticism or advice they will either do so and receive well thought out opinionated responses or personal attacks on their character by those who can’t accept opposing views. No matter your opinion have a conversation and talk about your differences. The first person who attacks another person whether it’s it’s in a post/conversation or in response to a one, direct or indirect, they are who I would see as unnecessarily offended. Stating your opinion in a calm and direct manner is not taking offence or being a ‘snowflake’, people have opinions it’s part of human nature. There’s a difference between the two."

These are unspoken thoughts most people with eating disorders experience at some point, like euphoria from a painful situation. Not everyone would say they like have an eating disorder but when your brain is sick others comments hit differently than when you are well. These comments right now almost validate your ed and makes you feel like the pain has paid off. A lot of people when deep into their eating disorder enjoy the attention, the sensations and how it feels because it’s not really about the attention it’s the validation. Knowing you have ‘full control’ over a situation, feels good, like it’s a success when others recognise somethings up. When it’s pointed out your brain sees that as something to celebrate and enjoys every minute of it. It takes fully recognising the severity of the situation, realising you’re not in control at all and getting help to leave that mindset. It’s when you lose that sense of control and put on weight or are at the stage of death that it becomes a lot less enjoyable. When you start to see that that and get help it you realise how much control you have lost and how much it has taken its toll on you physically and emotionally but eventually it will be a hell of a lot easier and less emotionally straining.

Not denying that a lot of this gen z are but I would dare say that it’s no more than any other generation or at least not much more than millennials, gen x and Baby boomers. The only reason we assume it is, is because we have social media now, something more popular now than ever. This gives a voice to the defiant or those who like to complain but we forget about all those others who say nothing, who keep to themselves and avoid controversial topics/conversations or making complaints. We see someone state their opinion and depending on how progressive their opinion may be they are labelled as ‘Boomer’ or ‘Zoomer’, a ‘Karen’ or a ‘snowflake’. Not everyone holds the values associated with their generation and are grouped in with others making it seem like wow there’s so many “offended zoomers” when really half of the people complaining are millennials, Gen X or Baby Boomers and vice versa.

Everyone grieves differently and it could be the case that your SIL is detaching herself from her feelings for her child she has lost. She might say they don’t matter as much but her living children should be looked after despite her grief. They should not be neglected and realistically her feelings and grief matters but putting her grief above them would only end in more pain. It’s important that she grieves but grief does not remove her responsibilities as a parent. As awful as it sounds life must go on, asking for help is important if it gets too much but there’s some responsibilities you can’t neglect. Projecting your grief onto your SIL is what makes you TA.

Other people fear rejection and would prefer to know that the other person is attracted to their looks and personality (through talking and dating).

I see how it can be funny when reacting to something silly (Baby boomer generalising anyone else) but I also can see how it can be used to offend someone or shut down a persons opinion/end a conversation. 

It’s stupid if I’m honest but it’s good to remember Gen z wasn’t the first generation to  generalise people. The amount of comments I’ve seen coming from Baby boomers and Gen X blaming Millennials and Gen Z for all of life’s problems, changes or struggles. No doubt the Silent Generation were as critical of Baby Boomers as they are of the generations following them. It’s likely went on for centuries only this time some of this generation have responded in sarcasm as a way to shut it down. When unrelated it’s irrelevant and completely disrespectful but when blaming the generations below you it’s to be expected that they react. 

Most but not all of Gen Z are ‘rebellious teenagers fighting back on generationalism’ only they’re using sarcastic comments generalising an entire generation or those of similar beliefs in return. I’m not condoning the comments and personally believe people need to stop especially when the topic is of no relevance to their response. I do however believe that this is a two way transaction, people need to either stop slandering and generalising Gen Z (and Millennials) the same way or take it as a joke/get over it. This goes for Gen Z, Millenials and Gen X too.

As someone who’s just made the cut for Gen Z I would like to say we’re not all this way and I sincerely apologise if it’s made anyone feel like their opinion is irrelevant or stupid."

changemyview,fi7njsa,t3_f6dkk9,1582224709.0,"If you're eating 4500 calories a day even cutting down to 2000 -2500 calories a week you should start to see a significant change in your body weight. Slowly cut down on your caloric intake until you reach 2000 calories should be enough to see a difference. If you can reduce it down to 1500 - 2000 a day, while exercising for 150 - 250 mins a week you should begin to lose weight in no time. 

Fasting yourself, unless monitored by a medical professional, can be incredibly dangerous especially when you go from 4500 calories to 0 calories in the space of a day. Cutting down on calories/eating a healthy balanced diet while exercising (and drinking 2 litres of water a day) can do the same job as fasting without the negative effects it can have on your health.
Fasting for more than two days can be very dangerous but fasting in general for prolonged periods of time can cause your body to go into conservation mode and will burn calories at a slower rate in order to keep your body up and functioning. This means when you ’lose weight’ during those days you are likely losing water weight so when you return to eating normally your metabolism will be a lot slower than it originally was and it may be a lot more difficulty losing weight in the future. Also when you return to eating your weight will likely go back to the way it was but you will find it difficult to burn it off. You may also experience some side effects from prolonged fasting like your muscles may start to break down, you may lack energy, feel weak and tired. Your blood pressure may drop and due to the lack of food your blood sugar should begin to drop meaning your insulin levels will begin to lower AT FIRST. Your body will then attempt to restore it's insulin levels and will retrieve blood sugar from your liver which can cause your insulin levels to rise...basically you don't alleviate the risk of diabetes but may possibly increase this risk when fasting for long periods of time. Reducing your caloric intake slowly and each day eating less sugary foods/cutting down on sugar (no sugar in your tea/coffee, a piece of fruit instead of a piece of chocolate, etc) will reduce your risk of diabetes, fasting for days won't. 
If you want to fast I would recommend you talk to a dietitian, nutritionist or your GP and set out a diet plan or switch to intermittent fasting instead (not eating after a certain time until a certain time the following day) but I would recommend you talk to a professional first regardless. Also always eat breakfast! If you're losing weight breakfast can kick start your metabolism and increase the number of calories you burn throughout the day in some (not all) people. Eating 6 small low calorie meals a day instead of 3 main meals also works for some people as it keeps your metabolism going throughout the day which may also help those with binge eating disorder as these meals may be often but less likely to cause a hefty weight gain. Eating your food slowly for 20-30 seconds helps reduce snacking and makes you feel fuller quicker. After you've eaten if you're still hungry give it 20 mins, drink some water (1-2 cups) and after 20 mins hopefully you won't feel as hungry. Drink green tea to keep your metabolism up and running and switch to teas (without milk or only with milk once a day, semi skimmed or alternative unsweetened milks are preferred). Use smaller plates and smaller spoons/forks. Keep your leg shaking if you can when home alone or when sitting around to keep your metabolism going. Not sure if it's a myth but that's an idea but just make sure you keep eating. There's so many ways to lose weight without fasting trust me, it's a long process but it's better than risking your health

Back on topic! Starving yourself does not mean you have anorexia nervosa, ’fasting’ is common in anorexia patients and is typically part of the disease. It also is a symptom of bulimia nervosa and when not properly medically supervised many people (especially those fasting for weight loss) will be put at risk. Talking to a therapist while fasting can help with that line of thinking but once you start it can often be hard to stop turning to fasting as a weight-loss tool. If you experience body image issues or body dysmorphia it is also not recommended. Fasting is dangerous but if you have low self-esteem or issues with body confidence it can be a jump start into a life long illness. If the thoughts are there I would recommend you get some help or talk to a professional before jumping into fasting or any crash diets. The thinking is the start of it and if you're experiencing any thoughts along those lines or are enjoying/craving a fast please talk to a professional (a psychiatrist, psychologist, GP/doctor or any medical professional who will listen) 
I don't know what way you're thinking, no one does but I promise you it's not worth it.

I've struggled with both anorexia and bulimia nervosa at one point or the other and now my metabolism is the slowest it's ever been (it used to be really fast), I risked diabetes, being infertile, having a heart attack, developing osteoporosis 
That's not even the start of it and it all started with fasting to lose a bit of weight 
Fasting is a risk when not done properly with the right medical guidance and when doing it for the reasons I did it for (to avoid diabetes or heart disease, for self confidence, to be ’skinny’, better self-esteem)  I risked death"

As you’ve said death effects us all differently, but almost everyone lives through the 5/7 stages of grief after losing a loved one. Many will experience these stages quickly (that is not to say their grief is any less painful or valid than another who experiences grief over a prolonged period of time)
For others it may take a long time to recover especially when they aren’t given an opportunity to say goodbye before their loved one passes. This is unfortunately the case for many who miscarry, but as I say not everyone grieves this way. 
It is likely that your friend is struggling to accept what happened and is traumatised by the experience, as a result she may feel trapped in a state of pathological grief; a state of depression. Your friend needs professional help or support to get through this, something she might find at a support group or through attending therapy. Something that might help her slowly accept what has happened and to recover from the trauma she has experienced. It might not be easy to convince her to seek help so personally I would advise that you speak to a mutual (or not) friend, her husband or a family member if you know any personally. 
INFO: have you ever spoke to her about getting help before? Is her husband

In relation to your question I don’t consider you an asshole, you’re obviously worried about her and her child. I can’t blame you for that. In her vulnerable state she has neglected to show her child the same love she expresses for his sister. Something that is likely unintentional but calling her out or at least bringing awareness is needed to ground her and although she may be hurt right now it is important that she is made aware of her actions. From what you’ve said you spoke clearly and to the point which may seem harsh but she needs a reality check to bring her back down to earth, sugarcoating it would only enable her behaviour. You didn’t call her names or intentionally go out of your way to hurt her, you said what needed to be said. 
You did the right thing! Your friend is struggling and she needs support now more than ever, her child needs that too. BUT you can’t take that all on yourself, INFO; does anyone else you know, know of the situation? Do her friends and family enable it? 
Bringing up the idea of therapy will be a process but likely needs mentioned sooner rather than later. You may need to have a sit down with your friend and to talk it out. Your concerns (her mental state, behaviour, neglecting child) and the fact that you are only saying this because you care and are worried about her. It may be a group effort so I would get advice from others close to your friend to avoid a crisis situation without sugarcoating everything"

They were polite about it which can be respected but you wouldn’t be an asshole for cursing, it would be curtesy to avoid cursing around the child but they are in an adult area and at 12 they’ve probably heard worse.

AmItheAsshole,fexu49r,t3_eqri9u,1579436276.0,"INFO 
What country are you in? In the UK/Ireland children are allowed in hotel bars with an adult, although they are not allowed to buy or drink alcoholic beverages. They’re also allowed in restaurant/bars with an adult until a certain time. 

Where is the bar? If it was a bar in a family restaurant/hotel then the man was probably in the right to say something if he felt uncomfortable. 
His daughter has likely heard worse from school or even himself but he asked politely so I don’t see a problem on his part. 

I also understand your point of view, a bar is typically an exclusively over 18 area especially in a night club or concert venue. 12 year olds aren’t usually at a bar unless with an adult present, even then it is expected that if they are mature enough to sit at a bar they are mature enough to listen to a few curse words. If it’s a family restaurant I would suggest toning down on the profanities especially if there’s younger children around(under 12) or if someone feels uncomfortable. If the bar is a strictly 18+ area or venue then I wouldn’t worry as much as there’s likely no children around.

PublicFreakout,feeijf6,t1_fedywy4,1579034455.0,"I understand your opinion and honestly I agree, it's nice to be able to have an actual conversation on the topic rather than a brawl. 
In my opinion I think if a child was to ask their parents to dress a certain way or play with certain toys I would say fire away, as long as it's not inappropriate for their age. I think people are too fast to jump to the conclusion that a boy who's interested in girl clothes or girl toys is trans or vice versa. I would say let the child be the one to make that decision. Calling a child trans or buying a child the opposite gender clothing just because they liked one thing is where I would draw the line. If a child seems to have an interest in the opposite genders clothing/toys/activities or little to no interest in something typical of their  biological gender I would say let them explore that interest. Maybe opt for unisex clothing or toys when buying for your child until they are old enough to shop for themselves. I don’t see a problem buying a girl/boy toys made for the opposite gender but some may disagree,I just think it’s common for a lot of kids trans or not to enjoy most toys regardless of who they’re made for but I know that’s not always the case. 

If they show interest in something ‘for’ the opposite gender maybe buy them something every once in a while or something they can play dress up in. I wouldn’t buy a girl interested in boyish clothing a dress or skirt for everyday use if they hate dresses and i wouldn’t buy a boy who’s interested in ‘girly activities’ such as my little ponies and hates sports a football kit. Some children trans or not enjoy both, sometimes neither. 

But as long as you allow a child to explore their interests, within their age range. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying parents should let their children run free and do what they please but I think to avoid confusing their child, putting a label on their child or pressuring their child to dress in clothing of the opposite gender/do activities done by predominantly girls or boys/play with toys made for the opposite, unless a child has openly said ‘I would like to wear that’ or stick to unisex clothing. I don’t think there’s a problem with the toy department but to make sure the child doesn’t feel trapped into a certain lifestyle (acting a certain way, wearing particular clothes, etc) or made to feel uncomfortable. 

I personally wouldn’t shelter a child from the fact that trans people exist for example if they ask why a trans adult is wearing something of their ‘preferred gender’ answer their question but don’t also say to the child “you’re trans because you wear that”. Plenty of trans people have known from a young age but for some kids just have certain interests at a young age or develop interests as they get older that are typically seen as something for the opposite gender while being cis/confident in their biological gender.

These people who say ‘I’m not going to tell my child their gender incase they’re trans or non binary’ take it too far I think. This opinion may be a bit unpopular or make no sense, sorry about that. I hope you have a good week too!"
PublicFreakout,feb3rio,t1_feavxwo,1578955171.0,"I agree it's wrong for anyone to celebrate a child, trans or not dancing provocatively or wearing revealing clothing. I think waiting until they're older but as a child, if that's being celebrated its wrong. 

I don't think it's just homosexual adults as I've argued my bit with heterosexuals on this topic as some people believe its ok if they're considered to be in drag (like that photo, it seems to be drag rather than a trans kid, I may be wrong) 

I would question where the child has seen this behaviour as they're likely copying it from a parent or guardian (homosexual, bi or heterosexual) which is the worry.

It’s almost promising that she will be homeless if you get into an argument which may make her feel like she's walking on eggshells around you.  Conditional living circumstances, conditional love, a ”my house, get out” kinda thing. If you live together it's both your house. Your names on the lease so the house is your property but it is the home to more than one person. A home is shared so you should work together to figure a situation like this out. This is where she lives! I would be a whole lot different if she was only staying with you. I have never said ”Im going to my landlords property”, I've only ever said ”Im going home” when addressing the house I live in. I don't own the house. My partners name is on the lease but more than one person lives in the house so we call it ’our place’ not his place. Our home rules are made between us and when needsbe we negotiate with the landlord or each other in particular scenarios. There has been certain scenarios in which our landlord has made a rule in which we have been able to negotiate. 

For example; the no-pet rule - we promised to pay for or replace any property damaged once we moved out if allowed a pet, we were then granted permission to own a pet. We also negotiated that we would have a quiet animal that we like instead of a dog due to the noise. You're both adults, you have the option of negotiating or she should move out. Although I have these opinions I also have to ask, does she have any source of income? You say she doesn't work but is she paying at least something? If you're paying for everything she either needs to find a job or find some source of income. She needs to do her part too and contribute to the household, you can pay for everything in the house, that's unfair on you too. If her pet is wrecking your stuff she needs to take responsibility and either replace these things or give you the money for it. Make the house cat-friendly don't blame an innocent animal for it doesn't understand what's right or wrong. Attempt to train the cat if possible or if you do agree to ’get rid’ of her cat make sure you either find a home which you can guarantee for sure is loving, has time for the cat and is not abusive or neglectful. If you don't know or can't find anywhere bring the cat to a cruelty-free animal shelter so they can find a loving home.
