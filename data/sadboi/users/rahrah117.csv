BPD,ff9g5cu,t1_ff9empo,1579712302.0,"I’ve been so hesitant to try medication. I’m just so scared that it will be more negative then positive, mostly based off of previous experience before official diagnosis. And I know that I can absolutely not handle a 40hour work week on a consistent basis but I gotta do something or I’m out on my ass in the street and that’s just not an option. I think I’ll try meds just one more time. It’s so good to know that they work for at least one of us ❤️"
BPD,ff9f5b1,t3_es4b8r,1579711687.0,"This seems to be a common occurrence. My 7 yo even recognizes it, (it usually happens in the car on the way to school) and she will politely ask if I am talking to “me, or you?” And usually i am talking to myself. It’s almost a self-soothing tool but can be strange to outsiders or even myself if I don’t realize what I am doing. All I know is that I listen to what I need to say and at the end of the day, it’s okay to be your best listener."
BPD,ff9ek0v,t1_ff9cewu,1579711316.0,"That is something I struggle with, being honest about my mental state to employers. It’s so helpful to know that being upfront about it has been beneficial to someone. Thank you so much for your advice. I will try my best to be honest and forthcoming from the get go. That is one thing I haven’t fully tried and it’s nice to know that it does work, with the right employer."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fcap5st,t3_eggjzi,1577573777.0,SHE spends 95% of the day time out of her KENNEL but since she is a puppy she sleeps in there so she doesn’t eat all my clothes/shoes/bed/anything anywhere during the night
atheism,fc6evlf,t1_fc6cpmu,1577478925.0,"Okay but you can forgive the people who hurt your family, I get that. But I agree, WHY THE FUCK STAY AT THAT CHURCH????  Move away, switch churches, or religions even! I would NEVER continue to be around an abuser OR EVER put MY children in the way of a KNOWN AND PROVEN dangerous person."
atheism,fc6eju4,t3_egd37r,1577478704.0,"I will never understand why catholic priests who commit horrible crimes like pedophilia never actually pay for their crimes. And it’s sad that some poor boy is going to spend his life in prison for simply doing what the justice system failed to do. And fuck every single person who looked the other way just because the priest was a “man of god” 
GOOD FOR YOU DUDE YOU DID THE RIGHT THING"

AskReddit,fazis52,t3_eauhhu,1576416496.0,"So far I haven’t seen anyone comment with this issue which is very sad for me because I’m always looking for new ways to cope or to commiserate ): 

I have Borderline Personality Disorder. (BPD) every single day I experience a huge spectrum of intense emotions that I often can’t control. If I’m angry, I scream and stomp my feet knowing full well the whole time that I shouldn’t be reacting like that. I’m 25 for gods sake. If I am sad, I contemplate suicide or self harm. If I’m happy, I experience joy to the point of tears. ALL THIS IN TWO HOURS. I’m exhausted. I struggle with alcohol addiction and most likely will die from it. (Yes I’ve gotten help several times and am actively in treatment) Not to mention, the paranoia and dissociation from reality that come with BPD suck. Half the time I’m not sure what is real."

AskReddit,ewv1d03,t3_cqb4ke,1565796476.0,"My very first memory, 3 years old. I remember my father had got me a Bart doll about the same size as me and I would sit with him to watch The Simpson’s. My favorite show at the time. Anyways, i remember that I got very upset with Bart because he wouldn’t talk back to me! I began to strangle the doll, (like Homer) and I shouted “SPEAK BART!!!! SPEAK!” My mom came in all confused and turned the tv off and I wasn’t allowed to watch the Simpson’s for a long time. And that’s my first memory."
