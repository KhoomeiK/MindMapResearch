IMEI numbers are not private. There are 3rd party sites with IMEI database that can tell you device specifications along with the carrier info of the phone. 

Its pretty common to share IMEI while trading phones on ebay. 

Fuck, this government can prolly download databases for free online. Will be more complete than whatever they put together. 

IMEI cannot be tracked from your home by some kiddo running Kali Linux with a parabolic antenna.

You wanna track a phone? tell every major telecom company in this country to report if the sim is used on their network.

It can only be done from their Base stations, police could always do it. Nothing much changes.

IMEI blacklist will cut down on stolen devices, you CAN change your IMEI number (illegal, android only) It is not exactly easy & your device still may not work with any network."
