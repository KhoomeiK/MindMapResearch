And the physical chemistry in the previous toxic relationship wasn't build in a day, everything takes time the way it took time to even get out of the toxic relationship. For now I am taking a break from relationships and using this time to explore myself physically and mentally.
If you already have a great relationship going on then maybe try and spice things up in it and let it happen slow and steady. Have a grip on yourself and don't lose something great for a past baggage."

You need to take a stand and call yourself out on your bullshit and stop yourself when you get these thoughts. If you get a thought like this, you can't help it but you can stop from thinking about it more and giving it life. You can try replacing these thoughts with other things to distract yourself or constructive thoughts. It's not easy, I really know and it doesn't always work but I am trying and it's snail speed progress."
