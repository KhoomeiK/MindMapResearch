husky,ezoybsw,t1_ezms8qh,1568030030.0,"This is my second husky! We currently have a 5 year old. My biggest piece of advice would be to start crate training young. We feed them in their crates and give them Kong‚Äôs in their crates, so for them it‚Äôs a fun space that they want to be in. 

Also, they must have an outlet for their energy. It doesn‚Äôt have to be just walks. You can take them on hikes, get some cheap agility equipment, enrichment (puzzles/other brain games), etc.

Andddd if all else fails, get your puppy a friend!! Huskies are social animals and do best in pairs!"

depression,exlvqjb,t3_cml6ni,1566420114.0,"I gained weight from my anxiety/depression meds. Now I‚Äôm fat, ugly, unmedicated, and depressed. If it wasn‚Äôt for my dogs I would end it all."
JUSTNOMIL,exilzf3,t3_crsq5e,1566331012.0,"Wowwww this woman sounds very similar to my MIL... if you don‚Äôt include her in a conversation, she cries. If you look at her the wrong way, she cries. My dog knocked over her lamp (didn‚Äôt break it), she cried. Once, I was walking down the hall after using their bathroom and she said ‚Äúyeah you better run‚Äù ?? When I confronted her and asked if she was threatening me, she went over to the wall and banged her head into it. So dramatic. I eventually blocked her on all platforms and now if she wants to see her son, I leave the house so I don‚Äôt have to deal with her. This kind of turned into a rant but OP, I feel your pain!!! Stay strong."
