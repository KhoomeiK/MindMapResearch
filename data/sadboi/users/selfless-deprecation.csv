After reading a post exactly like this on reddit I decided to stick with the book, and I was so glad I did.
I can only talk from my experience but after a few more chapters it just clicked and I got into the flow of the book (which at the start I found confusing and jarring.) I ended up loving it!
My advice would be to keep at it just because I was feeling the same and almost stopped reading it, I do plan on reading it again sometime soon!"

Social media is much worse, constantly seeing how much “better” of a time everyone else is having, compared to you just sitting their scrolling.
