1. I talked to my doctor and had to make some changes. Not to my medicine but to some of the ways I was living. Had to give up sex, drugs, all alcohol. They were interacting with the meds and the sex I was having wasn’t healthy. 

2. The smallest goals. Walk 1/4 mile today. Walk 1/2 tomorrow. Continue towards a goal. 

It really doesn’t last forever and I know it feels like it will. And nothing I say will help truly. You won’t be fixed in one day. But in time, this will feel silly because you’ll be so happy."

So once I wasn’t manic as often, I made a list of indicators that I’m going to be manic soon. 

Are you thinking about shopping? Are you making plans with old friends? Are you jerking off more? Etc. these are just the ones for me. 

Maybe instead of acting on the sex urge you can masturbate first? Or set a rule that if you want sex you just have to wait like 4 days before you have sex with that person. Get their number and decide later. 

Do what works for you!"

TheOA,ewegeld,t3_cme3wu,1565323274.0,"I did a thing, hopefully one of y'all sees this because it's strange: Netflix doesn't release data on how many viewers watch a show but there are market research tools available to benchmark. I used Google analytics to compare renewed Netflix shows like the OA. Well, the OA has outperformed 13 reasons why a number of times. That's so fishy to me. People are showing about the same interest in the two shows.

I asked him why and he said he has needs and that his boyfriend wasn't having sex with him enough... He is currently trying to get back with the guy after breaking up. He says he feels really bad and won't do it again. But when I was talking to him I realized he has no ability to put his boyfriend's needs and happiness above his own. He wants sex so he's going to go get it.

The lie: luckily, my parents didn't see my friend. I think he was dancing somewhere outside their field of vision. We get dressed before they come down to the basement and they send him home so they can talk to me. I then explain ""My legs were very itchy, so itchy in fact that I had to strip completely naked to itch them. And my friend was upstairs in the bathroom during so I was alone in the basement.""
