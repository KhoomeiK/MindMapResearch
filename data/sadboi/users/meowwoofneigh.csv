Weightlosstechniques,f84bczp,t3_dyry47,1574239368.0,"At your weight, there is no possible way you are fat. Whoever is telling you that is just wrong. And they are probably jealous of you. 

Instead of skipping meals, maybe try eating a small high protein snack like beef jerky, nuts, Greek yogurt, etc. Just something to keep your blood sugar nice and level while also helping your body stay fueled enough to keep you growing since you‚Äôre so young. 

You can‚Äôt lose weight in a specific area but you can tone areas to kinda cinch them in. Doing core exercises like regular planks, side planks and sit ups will build abs and pull/cinch in the stomach area. It‚Äôs also just really great for you anyway. 

Remember: you eat to be healthy and strong. I can‚Äôt describe how much more beautiful I feel when I am strong instead of just skinny."
