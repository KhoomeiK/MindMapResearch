That's amazing you didn't get sucked down that path when your ex started using. Maybe that part of you still being pregnant helped you not start using. It's sad how drugs can change someone who you loved, appreciated and cared so much about. That's why I left my son's mother cause she started using and I left her after 6 years. Only to start using myself 4 months later. I think what prevents us from wanting to use, is having gone down that road before and we know exactly how it ends either jail or death. The chosen few who have survived, can hopefully share theirr experience and save those who need it the most. It makes me happy that there is other parents out there who had faced my similar situation and chose life, chose their children over the urge to use. Sitting there in that front yard that day for hours holding my child thinking this is the last time I'm Gunna see him and hold him was the worst feeling I've ever experienced. I knew right then I was done and I would never put my child through this again. God gave me a second chance."

I think I got my karma and why I never had a date until I was 18. I found when I was looking for a women it was harder cause I was trying to hard and women can sense that. But when I stopped looking and just did what made me happy, kept busy and focused on my life the women came to me and it was a natural course. There were nights at buddies houses going there to just hangout with the boys and end up getting a girls number and dating. Girls in my opinion like guys who can show confidence, humor, and independence. Every woman is different tho. My experience with tinder is soley for hook-ups or being that break-up sex guy for some chick. I wouldn't go there looking for a deep and meaningful relationship.

She says the same thing about me just a love for us to be happy, healthy and prosperous. Nothing wrong with that in my eyes.

But anyway I lost everything cause of drugs and love and moved back in with my mom, first time in 10 plus years I've lived with her and now with a child. She knew about my relapse cuz of the weight loss, and I confided in her about everything. 
Ive relapsed a few times but it was just a weekend thing and nothing more, she never knew, she did joke one time saying I was tweaking cuz I was up all night but nothing more came of it. Idk if they know but don't want to bring it up to avoid conflict or wait to see if it becomes a problem. Either way they aren't stupid and know us and our sober self. Maybe it's just love that keeps them at Bay and knowing that we will come to them when we need them most.
Hopefully I don't have to go through this with my child, but if I do, I'll know every sign and symptoms of drug abuse. I won't let him go down that road."
