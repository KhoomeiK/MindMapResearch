Mania is not subtle. Hypomania is. The easiest way to tell is hypomania can come and go. Mania results in jail, hospital or death. You might experience a mixed hypomanic state. That means a mix of depressive episode and hypomania combined. It sucks. And it becomes obvious your brain isn‚Äôt functioning right. 


If you have a direct family member, it increases your chances considerably. A parent with the defective bipolar genes can pass it on, or they can pass on just anxiety disorders, ADHD, unipolar major depression, or a combination. 


Once someone‚Äôs bipolar genes go full activation, what they call ‚Äúonset,‚Äù it becomes obvious something is really wrong, no matter what meds someone takes. 


When this happens, someone with what they believed was unipolar major depression starts noticing their mood and emotions becoming a lot more chaotic.

They likely won‚Äôt kick you out after finding out your diagnosis (they will eventually find out). This info comes from 10 years ago when I was researching because I was hoping to hide my unipolar major depression:


As long as you‚Äôre not on psychoactive drugs and can do basic without them, then the military will yell at you but not punish you, as long as you‚Äôre a decent person and not some asshole running around screaming or a fat lazy shit.


Many people developed mood disorders, general anxiety, etc ... while in the military. And some said they got honorably discharged while others were allowed to medicate with their boss‚Äôs approval. Others said their boss reported them. Depends on your military boss and what your duty is. Many that took anti-anxiety meds listed office personnel. I‚Äôm guessing a combat soldier would be moved to a desk job if they developed anxiety disorder or their latent bipolar genes manifested or something. 


I can say no one was, not hear of, anyone who kept their diagnoses hidden and were then dishonorably discharged and prosecuted for lying to the military by keeping their diagnosis secret. Everyone said they just let you slide, as long as you‚Äôre not a shitty recruit, and that hiding diagnoses of depression and such are very very common."

Example: doctor says you have bipolar. Insurance - Denied. Try cheaper meds first. If he specifies bipolar depression correctly, then covered. Probably it‚Äôs an office admin that did the call.


At the end of the day, if you call the insurance every day, it will eventually get resolved for you. Prior authorization is a way to add a hurdle to keep fewer individuals from getting the newer, expensive meds. If you burn their time enough, the problem will get resolved.


My favorite tactic is playing friendly and stupid.
