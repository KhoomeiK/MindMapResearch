TeenAmIUgly,fe6b06a,t1_fe2spd9,1578885846.0,the mirror was too far so i had to crop the whole thing. you can ask a question without being rude btw
TeenAmIUgly,fe6avnz,t1_fe45j32,1578885754.0,"thank youu and yes i have done my research but i feel like i had to ask bc i think im still missing a lot of things.

i do eat unhealthy foods for gaining weight hehe. i eat pizza a lot lol i honestly think eating anything is okay because im trying to gain weight and it's already hard enough that i dont gain and it would be a lot harder for a beginner to start eating clean. i eat anything right now but i will gradually eat unhealthy foods less, i think it's a slow process. anyways thanks!"
TeenAmIUgly,fe6adwn,t1_fe1tg1q,1578885395.0,not loads of muscle mass but i have tried and i gained a little but i didnt gain weight that's probably where all i ate went lol thanks
TeenAmIUgly,fe6a61u,t1_fe1o6ce,1578885239.0,"yes im working on being the ideal version of myself, thank u!

i have already tried that bmi website and my result is underweight. i havent tried the calorie calculator yet but thanks ill check it out. and dw im naturally skinny i think it's bc of my genes from my mom and my fast metabolism, even back when i had a normal bmi and ate a lot i didnt really gain weight but i thought i looked fat then so i guess i have body dysmorphia bc looking at my photos before i actually dont look fat i looked like a healthy kind of skinny which makes me wonder if being thicc would make me think im fat or want to go back to being skinny idk i guess ill have to find out

it's kind of invalidating to say getting fat is easier because im having a really hard time right now but im sure you mean well. anyway thank u for suggesting things"
TeenAmIUgly,fe69k3z,t1_fe2eu9i,1578884807.0,"this is helpful, thank u!"
TeenAmIUgly,fe0bln8,t1_fe005w7,1578808833.0,i feel u it's so hard im just forcing myself to eat so i could gain but even if i exercised five times a week and count my calorie intake ive only gained very very little and i keep losing it. anyway thank youu that really means a lot bc i really need motivation right now ty i appreciate it!!
TeenAmIUgly,fe0b69d,t1_fdzyjj6,1578808415.0,it's sad but true i am underweight that's why ive been trying to gain weight
TeenAmIUgly,fe0b1sm,t1_fdzw09j,1578808294.0,yes i count my calorie intake
TeenAmIUgly,fe0b0ll,t1_fdzwylr,1578808261.0,"yes thank you this is very helpful. i eat rice everyday im asian lol and i try to make sure to eat 1700 or more per day though there are also very few days that i didnt i just feel too full x(

i always check my weight and ive only ever gained very little like .5 or 1kg i dont consider it a gain at all because i keep going back to my original weight it's so hard"
TeenAmIUgly,fdzq465,t1_fdzp50e,1578793217.0,ive tried exercising for a while now and my appetite got bigger and ive been eating a lot more so i could gain but sadly i didnt gain weight at all it's such a huge struggle for me x(
