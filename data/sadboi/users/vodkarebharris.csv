However if you get insecure about your s/o being a social butterfly, that may be something you could work on with yourself. Figure out why it bugs you if it does. Just be cautious and don‚Äôt let yourself get too invested without having discussed your feelings for one another yet (Unless you have discussed them, but im getting you probably haven‚Äôt)."

twinflames,fg0m4d1,t1_fg0c7xz,1580410550.0,"I definitely think false hope can be a thing but like I said even if the person your with isn‚Äôt your TF it doesn‚Äôt mean that relationship is destined to fail or there isn‚Äôt any unconditional love there. I think it comes down to what voice in your head is more loving. If you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúthis person is my twin‚Äù and a voice comes in saying ‚Äúno they‚Äôre not youre lying to yourself. Your saying that to make yourself feel better. Stop being so naive‚Äù then it‚Äôs probably your ego. Your intuition wouldn‚Äôt present itself in such a hurtful way. However if the voice were to say ‚ÄúNo they‚Äôre not, but that‚Äôs okay. You don‚Äôt need to be twin flames to be in love‚Äù or something like that then it very well could be your intuition. Or it could be a form of detaching and accepting that that person may never come back and that‚Äôs okay because you‚Äôll live and still be able to have a fulfilling life."

twinflames,ffva0no,t3_evdwxu,1580259221.0,"Another thing i want to mention is a lot of us have a fear of letting go, because holding on is the only thing we know how to do. So you sit there, absolutely dedicated to keeping the connection from severing, because you‚Äôre scared if you let go, you wont be strong enough to rebuild that bridge. You‚Äôre scared you can‚Äôt do it or that you‚Äôre too weak to. Because there‚Äôs already a bridge there supplied for you, despite the damage and unstableness of it, at least it still connects you to your twin. But here‚Äôs the thing, and this is important

!!!!if you are dedicated, committed, and determined to holding that bridge together, then you will absolutely have enough dedication, commitment, and determination to rebuild it.!!!!

Because YOU don‚Äôt give up. And because you don‚Äôt give up, you‚Äôre so so strong. It‚Äôs just about shifting mindsets. Instead of being committed to holding the rope and fixing what‚Äôs already broken, be committed to rebuilding that bridge and providing new things that will work, and getting yourself the things YOU need to survive. You may be committed to holding onto that rope, but without taking care of yourself, you WILL grow exhausted and have nothing to offer to the relationship besides the fact that you‚Äôre holding on. 

Once you let go and venture off and replenish yourself, it makes that commitment to rebuilding that bridge a millllion times better and much easier because you will be reenergized and stronger. 

Your twin may be yelling at you from the other side ‚Äújust let go! we can go find help!‚Äù But you won‚Äôt, so they might walk away themselves hoping that if they‚Äôre out of your sight, you‚Äôll eventually go do the same. Follow their lead in a sense. It‚Äôll hurt, you‚Äôll feel left alone on the cliff abandoned, but that‚Äôs not what your twins higher self wants. They simply want you to realize the other options and solutions while they work on finding them themselves. You don‚Äôt want your twin sitting there starving and sleep deprived trying to hold it together either. You want them to be healthy and happy on their own side too so THEY have love to offer you. and when you return, they‚Äôll be there smiling, ready to work, ready to build, ready to reunite. 

You guys GOT THIS! Go drink a glass of water, take care of yourself, reenergize, and come back stronger than ever with the right tools. There‚Äôs no rush. You CAN DO IT. 

Hope this made sense ‚ù§Ô∏è"

twinflames,ff74nev,t1_ff73n7g,1579641041.0,"I know that you‚Äôre right.. but the fact that theres nothing really PROVING to me that we‚Äôre twins kills me. all of this just has to do with faith in everything. Faith that he is my twin. Faith that i‚Äôm not wasting my time. And faith that this will all workout in the end including where i need to be. Having faith is so hard for me because i‚Äôm ALWAYS let down. I‚Äôm just waiting for something to happen to let me down for having hope that this situation could get better. I‚Äôm in so much pain right now. I know the only thing I can do is work on myself and finding that self love that I‚Äôve never had. Its so hard trusting myself that i can do it and get to a point in my life where I can maintain that self love, self reliance, and self respect without worrying about whether or not i‚Äôm going to give in to all the pain again. The pain is so easy to give in to because its all ive ever known. Being disappointed from getting my hopes up is ALL IVE EVER KNOWN. I‚Äôm terrified of having faith in this because what if its just like everything else ive gotten my hopes up over? What if i just don‚Äôt deserve to have something THIS good go the way I want it to just one time? Ive been wrong about so many things i just wanna be right about this so badly. Im so convinced we‚Äôre twins but everything else going on around me, including how he‚Äôs feeling, is tearing that certainty down and now questioning whether or not he is my twin is hurting me on top of already missing him and already hating how badly the situation got. I‚Äôm absolutely terrified of being wrong this time. He‚Äôs my home. He‚Äôs the light in everything. I wish i could explain how much i love him. I just want us to be okay. I want to be right so badly. That we are twins. That this was just temporary, and that we will have the beautiful life together that we‚Äôve always wanted. But everyone and everything telling me ‚Äúthat isn‚Äôt realistic‚Äù is really holding me back from taking any faith i have seriously. Im just so impatient and im so scared."

Codependency,fdfpdeu,t3_el4r4o,1578367016.0,"It definitely can be! I lost my dad at 2 years old, and because i was so little and didn‚Äôt understand death and that it wasn‚Äôt his fault, all my brain could conclude was that he had abandoned me. If anything it has less to do with the codependency itself, and more to do with the fear of abandonment that COMES with codependency. When we lose someone we love, ESPECIALLY a parent, we develop this sense that if we can lose someone so close to us, then in any relationship at any moment the rug can be ripped from underneath us. Thats why we desperately cling on to a person to save us from the fall. The idea of losing someone is so scary, but when we try so hard to make sure they stay, we almost always end up pushing them away. I know it‚Äôs easier said than done, but one of the most important things anyone struggling with codependency has to realize is that every time we‚Äôre in a relationship, we‚Äôre with a completely NEW and UNIQUE person, so it‚Äôs important to not instill past losses into them because that forces us to start believing that the same thing is going to happen with this new person when we truly have no idea. Is it possible they‚Äôll leave? yes. Is it possible they won‚Äôt? yes. Whether we like it or not, that‚Äôs life. We lose people sometimes, and other times we don‚Äôt. But when a new relationship just starts, the possibilities of what could happen are endless. It‚Äôs a clean slate. It‚Äôs our habits and our fears and our beliefs that determine the ultimate destination of a relationship so you have to make sure you‚Äôre not dreading the end from the very beginning or else you will lose them. Its like that saying, you‚Äôre thoughts create your reality and that is 100% true. Yes you have scars, yes you have past losses, but those were with different people and they‚Äôre in the past. All you can do is move forward and let go of all the doubt and fear that you‚Äôre gonna lose someone, because if that‚Äôs all you think about, then that will become your reality. You gotta have faith in your other relationships. I know the thought of losing someone is scary, but think about whats happening in the moment: you haven‚Äôt lost them. they‚Äôre here. they‚Äôre in your life right now. if you wanna keep it that way, then let go of all the ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù because they don‚Äôt matter. you can‚Äôt control the future, you can only control yourself in the moment. Stay positive. Make changes. Adapt to how a person acts and know that it‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt always understand each other. That its okay to have ups AND downs. That it‚Äôs okay to not always agree on something. Thats normal. Those things aren‚Äôt red flags or hints that your relationship is going to inevitably end. We have to learn to let go and not try so hard and to just accept things for what they are in this moment and understand that we are only in control of ourselves. Whether someone you love does something that hurts your feelings or upsets you, realize that there is nothing you can do to control THEM and their actions, and that in those situations you can choose how to respond rather reacting out of fear and hurt to make sure you don‚Äôt hurt them with anything you say, because that can create a toxic relationship."

He understood the promise he was making and he took it really really seriously because of how much love he has for me. So for him to break that promise, i had to have broken him. He won‚Äôt let me make it up. I hate myself so much now and I keep trying to think of things to say to him to maybe to come back but i know they won‚Äôt.
