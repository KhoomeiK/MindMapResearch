I have a friend who was recently diagnosed, and he also happens to have experience with cocaine. He explained to me that his manic episodes feel **a lot** like being on cocaine. Just not as intense (and obviously without all the physical health risks).

I can see it, honestly. I‚Äôve never tried cocaine, and I sure as hell don‚Äôt ever plan on doing so; but this definitely feels like what I‚Äôve heard about it. And it‚Äôs the brain doing it to itself. That‚Äôs so fucking wild."
