I want to get out of my town too. It’s like a black hole. I feel like and like to think of myself as limitless, yet this town is limiting me greatly"
lonely,fqtcy47,t3_gknw5c,1589636356.0,"Are you from a small town? If so, that could be part of it although I’m not 100% sure. I know you’re looking for advice instead of “I can relate” stories... but I’m 33 going on 34 in a couple months and I have never been on an actual date either. I had relationships in high school and that’s because I knew them. I was single pretty much all of my 20s. I met someone in an online chat at 28 and eventually met up with them in real life. The long distance relationship was much too hard. I’ve been single since that ended. Myself... I know that a bar is not where you find relationship or marriage material. Dating apps: there aren’t enough profiles in my area. Been so tired of it that I’ve been approaching girls in grocery stores and wherever. Always ends with “I have a boyfriend or married”. I’m lonely in my own house as well. Pets would make it easier but I’m so lonely that I find myself just trying to work my life away and I would need to be there for my pet. I’m sorry but I really don’t have an answer. I feel like I’ve tried everything. I workout and stay in great shape and even though that shouldn’t be what attracts someone I hope that it would help but hasn’t for years. I feel like I have great boyfriend or husband qualities. Sometimes it’s almost just like a curse. I really don’t know. All I know is you’re not alone. 

As for your question. I almost believe people think loneliness does define your worth. I think that people think if other people don’t want you then they shouldn’t want you either. The second other people want you, the ones you may have been trying to see all of a sudden start wanting you. It’s extremely shitty human nature. I’m not going to be the guy that sits here and is like “he’ll come along, be patient”. I’ve been patient for a long ass time and heard that shit way too much. I’m not going to be 50 and all of a sudden someone comes along. By 50 I will have given up caring about being with anyone. Anywho... best of luck"

Stay away from high sugar and high sodium foods. Sugar is explanatory and sodium causes you to store water. Stick with vegetables and lean meats and do some HIIT (high intensity interval training). Do fasted cardio. Go for a mile run in the morning and make sure you really get your heart rate up before eating anything. Then when it’s time to eat make a good portion of your meal protein. Drink lots of water. Water will flush out all the bad toxins lingering in your belly. Keep us posted!"
