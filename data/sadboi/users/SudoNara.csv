3DS,fqy2yn2,t1_fqy2izb,1589741743.0,Mostly joking. Wish my VCRs still worked. So much old shows and anime recorded.
3DS,fqxx9tx,t1_fqxwrah,1589739252.0,Maybe stop living in 2002.
Terraria,fqws9i0,t1_fqw0oca,1589715924.0,Here's the link for the program. https://ntcore.com/?page_id=371 Simply extract the zip folder to wherever on your computer. Run the program and choose the tmod.exe to patch it to use 4gb.
NintendoSwitch,fqws1c5,t1_fqvvy9u,1589715702.0,"Not to hard. I watched SpawnWave's tutorial. Just be careful to slowly split the two halves of your joycon because there is a small ribbon cable. The joystick is modular, so you can replace it very easily. It's not soldered down like Dualshock 4 sticks."
NintendoSwitch,fqvnajm,t1_fqvhpli,1589680893.0,Nintendo apologist everywhere. I got drift after only a year and I play mostly RPGs. I replaced the stick on my own. This drift issue needs to be taken care of once this pandemic situation gets under control around the world.
Terraria,fqvhxsa,t1_fqvhtzy,1589677646.0,Never mind. I have the 64 bit version and got the 32 bit version working by patching it to work with 4gb of RAM instead of 2 gb of RAM.
armoredcore,fqsxpja,t1_fptod3a,1589622717.0,Daemon X Machina is on PC. The gameplay is similar to 4th Gen AC.
Breath_of_the_Wild,fqsxb1n,t3_gkim7d,1589622284.0,Art style is great and with some cell shading this would be top notch.

ps3piracy,fq8hy1d,t1_fq8g986,1589166606.0,Thank you very much. :) I've been using mobile more often cause of the quarantine.
ps3piracy,fq8f53s,t1_fq8ewt3,1589164800.0,Having a sticky post for trusted site links would be a good idea like r/roms. A lot of sites that were being posted before the sub had died were either malware or just filled with broken links and corrupt files.
ps3piracy,fq8es5o,t1_fq8emhr,1589164565.0,"The previous mod had abandoned the sub because he/she believed that subs like these don't need mods. Although, that might have been a reason why this sub died."

DaemonXMachina,fpym717,t1_fplgrfi,1589006162.0,It wasn't that bad.

EmulationOnAndroid,fptvuwi,t3_gcwmgo,1588899301.0,Do you happen to know where ishiiruka's files are on Android? It's not in the internal storage. Do you know the default location that the files would be in.
DaemonXMachina,fptgdx5,t1_fptef7e,1588890762.0,Perfect. I'll pick up that version later.
DaemonXMachina,fpte60o,t1_fpmf80o,1588889606.0,Can the Japanese release be played in English if region is changed? Some Japanese Switch games change the wrotten language to whatever you current Switch region is.
DaemonXMachina,fptduuv,t1_fpt0cl3,1588889445.0,"This is a problem for a lot of modern games with silent protagonists. How should these customizable characters be written? One idea is just forgoe customization of the outer, but where is the fun in that. I'm not really sure what could be done without having to do so many animations for different player models and different voice acting."
armoredcore,fpr7iyj,t1_fpqczol,1588845237.0,"I actually kind of agree. ACV was spitting in the face of long time AC fans back when it came out. This is my opinion of course. I know there are fans of ACV/VD, but the two games took so many things that were staple to the franchise and I dislike how multiplayer focused the games were. These were the last two games and AC went out with a whimper instead of a bang."
roblox,fpqjj3p,t3_geojl6,1588824269.0,Is Catalog Heaven still a buggy mess? I've been trying to play the game for months now and nothing seems to work in the game for me.
SonicTheHedgehog,fpqjdal,t1_fpqja9e,1588824159.0,Brand exclusivity be a bitch. Everyone should be able to play games on their preferred system.
SonicTheHedgehog,fpqj42u,t1_fpqdr5s,1588823986.0,"In this day in age, I believe everyone should have a decent computer. Everyone had an mp3 player and disk burner back then. Same thing."

JRPG,fpjiq5x,t1_fpiarn4,1588670011.0,"Not really true, seeing as many of Nintendo's games run on the same of similar engine. I still don't understand why Square wasted so much time on the Luminous engine."
acecombat,fpjhuze,t3_gdjpbj,1588669073.0,Hopefully there will be more sales for this game because I can't afford it right now.
mkbhd,fpjhagr,t3_gdb7wl,1588668458.0,Looking more like Etika really.
SonicTheHedgehog,fpfmbgy,t1_fpffm8a,1588575742.0,"Yeah, especially that scene when Sonic got flung into space by Eggman and told Tails to take care of himself and Amy."
MMORPG,fpfaz5i,t3_gd0h5w,1588566132.0,"I'm in the same boat. I'm stuck playing old games, indies, and niche series. The new stuff just feels bland as hell and generic to me. There are good games coming, as I said niche stuff, but it's mostly cookie cutter IPs now. I can see many people getting burned out by gaming until something comes out that really revitalized the medium. BOTW and FF14 were close, but they still held on to current norms too much. This is just a my two cents. I'm probably talking out of my ass,  but I've been in a slump with gaming as a whole."
ps3hacks,fpf9kyi,t3_gcvfuq,1588565116.0,"It's an automated ban. You have the option of disabling syscalls, but then you can't use homebrew."

USPS,fp32nec,t1_fp326fb,1588272041.0,"I didn't get it, but I don't think there would be insurance for it because it was 18$. I more upset that USPS messed up. The seller was nice, so I would personally feel bad by charging back."
USPS,fp30iiq,t1_fp2zhdr,1588270999.0,I don't really want to do something like that. It's not the seller's fault.

USPS,fp2xrni,t1_fp2xj0o,1588269661.0,"Thank you, but I already did that. Now I just have to wait. I actually have two post offices with the same zip code.

ps3hacks,fp2rxsy,t1_fp2f6g1,1588266885.0,Yeah. A little expensive right. It connects to everything though. Even Android devices. Enjoy.

Got to check to see my mailbox is ficking empty. This franchise is fucking cursed. I don't know what to do about the package, seeing as my post office is closed. Contacted the seller and he didn't reply even once. I'm done with Armored Core. Fuck this."

I'm feel less depressed these days because I really think that this game was just sucking everything out of me. Things will never change with Nexon at the helm. MMORPGs could be so much better. There could be so many more options, but it's all mediocrity. One of my favorite genres in the past too."

armoredcore,fop0slf,t1_fop0ce4,1587950569.0,Thank you. Please stay safe and I will definitely pm. I don't want anymore cats to become road kill. Happened to a very sweet cat. My family named him Milky. He was old and we fed him. One day he was slowly crossing the road and a car sped past and ran him over. I cried for so long. My family and I buried him in the backyard. I asked the city to put more stop signs along the road and a light because cars would always speed by. They finally did when an old lady almost got run over in our neighborhood. Some people really don't care for the lives of others.

I got the game on PC because I've always wanted an Armored Core game on the platform. Sorry if I sounded harsh in the previous comment.
