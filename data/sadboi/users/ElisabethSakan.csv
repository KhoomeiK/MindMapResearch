depression,fpfk8r8,t3_gd2oik,1588573826.0,"I did want to at one point in my life, but it was mainly  to issues that I’ve been trying to get advice on from people. I never told them about wanting to die, but I did tell people that I was starting to do mild self-harm that I knew was going to escalate if I can’t get help. 

Sometimes... they just can’t help, they don’t know how to help, even those who want to. I had to decide for myself about changing my circumstances, to try to do things that scare me but gives me hope of a better life and future. And that took me months to get the courage to do things for myself after reaching the point of actually acting on my thoughts to hurt myself. Don’t do it- it always made me feel worse after. 

I’m sorry that you’re going through such a rough time now, please don’t listen to the thoughts or feelings in your head that urge you to do stupid things. 

It’s cliche, but please, even if you don’t believe me now, keep these words in your head: it will get better. I still feel empty and not good enough most days, but at least I don’t wake up feeling sad that I woke up for another day anymore. 

Please get help, get therapy. Psychologists and psychiatrists are people who are professionally trained to help people who are in great emotional pain, I hope that you can find some relief as I did after going through numerous psychologists."

He won’t change- especially since he thinks that you’ll stick by him in the end even with this sort of behaviour. Move on for good, and you will be doing the both of you good in the long run- you by getting the happiness you deserve, and he, the life lesson on how to properly be with someone."
mentalhealth,fpcfpe3,t1_fpcd4ve,1588498859.0,"I very nearly broke off my own friendship and blocked a friend who did this to me since it was triggering my rejection and abandonment insecurities and I was feeling very small. But if my friend were to have done what you’re doing after I unblocked her and started to try to make our friendship do-able again, I think it would heal whatever hurt and rift I felt from it, since I thought we were at the phase of friendship where she didn’t have to put on a facade if she felt horrible- now I know that it isn’t true. 

I wish my friend could do what you did, but I don’t think it will happen since she has other unresolved issues and is on a waiting list for therapy- and I think our friendship will never recover because I will never be reassured that she won’t do it to me again. I’m glad for you though."
