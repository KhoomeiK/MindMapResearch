AskReddit,fq3e5vf,t3_ggdivs,1589065558.0,"I'm still working with some reduced hours here and there, so I haven't been as affected as most. However I havent been able to go out to eat or go shopping for clothes/non grocery around my area so that has helped me avoid spending money frivolously!

Also I haven't been feeling social or like hanging out with anyone recently (due to something I'm dealing with that is personal and being in a depressive +very anxious phase) so I haven't had to worry about declining invites to hang out! Weird way to benefit from the quarantine I know but for me its a pro."
mentalhealth,fpcd4ve,t3_gcdan4,1588496046.0,"I start to shut down, ghost people, and completely isolate when I'm really depressed. I did it for a few months last summer, it was really bad... one of my friends broke down crying when she told me how it hurt her feelings, and I still feel bad about that. I started taking anti depressants finally and see  a counselor soon, I'm hoping to prevent myself from going into thar bad of a state in the future.

Know you aren't alone, and I understand how difficult it can be to fight those phases. You should reach out to your SO at least, try to explain the best you can. In my experience, some people are more understanding about it than I would expect."

It has been very tempting to throw myself off of high surfaces but I'm still hanging in there. Thank you so much.

SexOffenderSupport,fojfz9u,t3_g7q9el,1587819817.0,"My fiance opened up to me himself about his background and case after almost 2 months of being together, and it really hasn't caused us any arguments. There are retrictions for where he can live, so while looking for a place to live together I have to keep in mind we can't go just anywhere. He has to meet with a PO regularly, which causes me some anxiety (I get anxious pretty easily tho) and I don't like that when he he told his PO he had a new girlfriend (me) his first question was if I was at least 18 (fiance is 30, I'm 29) but I understand they have to ask that. 

As for my family, I feel it is none of their business so I plan on never mentioning it to them. If someone in my family somehow finds out and asks me, then I'll talk with them about it. A close friend tried to challenge me as to why I stay with him despite his background/having to be on the registry, and I basically told her there are many reasons I am with him (one being he treats me very well and we get along great) and pointed out that she hasn't even met him in person and needed to keep her opinions to herself. She crossed a line with me that made me decide not to tell any other friends about it. So be careful who you tell, because even when you try to explain your SO's side of the story, people can be harsh and judgemental as hell."

MentalHealthBabies,fnqsfst,t3_g37jhk,1587171226.0,"I'm having nightmares, anxiety, and many negative ruminations/thought patterns about my due date and its about 3 months out. I'm praying to be granted a c section, that my family and many friends do not find out about my situation, that the adoption process goes smoothly and I am not hassled down the road (yes I'm giving it up to adoption), that anyone that does happen to find out that I don't want knowing doesn't blab my secret to anyone and that they don't bother me in the future about it, and that my life/mind/body go back to normal ASAP. I hate this situation so much. 

I got on anti depressants but am still full of hatred, anger, and sadness. I have more therapy appointments coming up but I don't think any amount of talking will better my mindset until this nightmare is over. 

I'm definitely not in an average situation either... I have no idea who to even begin talking to that might relate. My boyfriend is getting better at listening to me but he doesn't have the thing growing in him and making him physically/mentally uncomfortable with himself. My female roommate likes to get drunk and give me shit for it being my fault and not using BC, etc. Which makes my self hatred grow more.

I'm small in stature/short as well. My dr is short/small too and tried to reassure me that she had two births that went well. That is wonderful for her but that doesn't necessarily mean the same for me. Also I'm very scared of being in labor for multiple days, not getting much if any sleep, and going into a really bad mindset.

If you don't mind me asking, was it difficult to get an elective c section approved by your doctor and insurance? I also have tokophobia and am struggling with depression. 

I asked my dr about getting a c section per request and the only issue they mentioned with that could be insurance coverage.

Im hoping if they refuse to cover it that i can set up a payment plan and cover it all myself... I really do not want to live with memories of childbirth, surgery makes me feel a lot more comfortable. I already have too many traumatic and painful memories now."
BabyBumps,fmdut8i,t3_fuawj4,1585978652.0,"Well for me, it is very unplanned and bf and I are not prepared. When i saw the positive home test, I'll admit I was drunk... so i felt a combo of ""oh shit"" not so happy but also thought ""maybe this is supposed to happen at this time?"" A bit of me was excited for maybe 24 hours, then I started feeling upser and angry. A week later at the dr appointment, it was confirmed, I was thinking it could only be 2 or 3 months max but guess what... it was a whole 2 months past according to the ultra sound. At that I felt angry, disgusted, sad, and all sorts of negative emotions. I was especially upset that I had much fewer options than I thought I would to deal with it.

Its about a month later, I'm at 26 weeks... and still very upset. Luckily I've been able to hide it by wearing baggier clothes even still and under my work vest. I'm not happy about it at all. Not prepared for a child at all, for many reasons. Already struggled with mental health. Luckily the bf is on board with me to adopt it away.

Sorry if this is more negative than what you'd expect to read or would care to read.

Anyways I've had several mom friends tell me they weren't overjoyed when seeing their positive and didn't feel connected to it for a few months. Everyone is different, don't feel bad for feeling a certain way."
BabyBumps,fmdtv1g,t1_fmdt9pb,1585977770.0,"Also, I'm going to add this because I am going through it: if she suffers from depression or develops depression during the upcoming months, please DO NOT make her feel bad for it. Do not call her weak, listen to her when she wants to talk,  and don't make her feel bad for sleeping a lot or being unable to do much of anything from being depressed. 

I hope your gf doesn't go through antenatal depression (depression during pregnancy, post partum depression after the baby arrives is much well more known). It is very mentally/emotionally rough.

If she does, you could suggest anti depressants and definitely suggest she tell her doctor and get a referral for someone to talk to."

She said there are a lot of times when only she can calm the baby (breastfeeding etc) and it has disrupted a lot of her sleep. 

I have multiple friends and acquaintances that are moms that end up getting stuck with the child more often than the fathers do while the fathers get more free time to do other things. 

Thia isn't the case for every couplw but it seems women get the shit end of the stick even after the baby is born."

I've noticed signs of wet brain too, which means her memory is getting weak. We've watched episodes of shows or movies together when she wasn't drinking enough to black out (or start of day when she had not drank much yet) and I'll talk about it a few days later/soon after and she'll have no recollection of watching the show or movie.

I'm seeing a doctor Tuesday and will beg if I have to so I can have a c section. I've read that many doctors might try to convince me to avoid a c section if possible but I made up my mind. I'm already living my worst nightmare so I hope the least they can due is grant my request to schedule a c section at 39 weeks (or sooner would be very preferred but idk how likely that is).

I stayed to myself for a week, was in my room most of the time and wouldn't answer calls or texts bc of the state of mind I was in. I'll call it having no energy to be social whatsoever. She ended up calling a mental health check on me through my county of residence, which I had no idea was possible.

 She claims she  thought they would only make me talk to a doctor/be seen for a few hours to make sure I'm ok, but guess what.. I got locked up in a  mental ward for 6 days. Didn't end up paying a dime of it thank god, but it was effing embarrassing and I felt like a trapped effing animal during that period. Originally she was going to have to testify in court as to why she thought I needed that but the dr seeing me said it wasn't necessary (thank goodness bc otherwise i could have been sent out of town to another hospital for up to a month...)

I can't believe she had that power over me.. she is not a relative, doesn't live with me, and for all she knew it could have been that I just didn't want to talk to her for a week and could have been living my normal routine otherwise. 

The mandatory hospital stay did not help me and has resulted in me not trusting her much anymore, and other people as well. It was embarrassing to tell family members about that fiasco. Several of them were upset for me and thought she had no right to go that far.

I guess I am lucky so far.. but im taking extreme measures to make sure this doesnt happen again. Never happened the first 27 years of my life. Way I see this is its another traumatic memory/experience I can bury after its said and done. I'm going to request a c section at all costs and will beg whoever I have to. No one will be in the room for me to associate with any memories of any appointments or hospital experiences. 

I've had so many awful thoughts on this situation that it almost scares me.

I had a friend get drunk and go on a rant about how my SO ( registered sex offender) could cause my life some difficulties with living situations, reputation, etc but I snapped on her and told her that is my business to worry about, not hers.

Fast forward to adulthood and I'll be alone, stressed out and upset with a huge urge to cry but can't, like a giant dam is hidden by my tear ducts.

My SO and I argued again tonight. He isn't helping me at all in terms of feeling great about my home and love life right now. I feel like I'm causing a lot of stress (mental state has been going south often the past couple of weeks and I've not been pleasant to be around..) 

I feel at this point that the road I travel after giving up the baby will not be near as rough as keeping it. Is it awful that I feel no connection to it over 20 weeks in?"

AskReddit,fkjggx1,t3_fiqjog,1584245192.0,"I don't consider myself a furry however I can appreciate a lot of the art. From what I've found after talking to a few friends that are furries, a lot of it is about the self expression and artistic renditions behind furry characters/fursonas.

Anthropomorphic characters are unique and interesting a lot of times, the furry artists usually have a lot of talent. People forget that characters like bugs bunny and Micky mouse could be considered popular furry icons. There was a post i read once where someone pointed out a lot of popular cartoon and videogame characters are examples of furry art/media, and that helped me understand the community better. Before i listened to a couple friends and read some furry blogs, I had a big misconception of what the furry community really is about.

A lot of the furry community is just wanting to socialize and make friends, its not all about a sexual tabboo and pornographic art. I don't care for that side of furry culture, but if someone else enjoys it I won't stop them, just be polite and don't throw it in my face or have it around me (bc who would do that with their porn preferenced and other kinks anyways).

I think there will still be a lot of judgement and harsh opinions from a lot of people that is aimed at the furry culture and community for a long while, unfortunately."

I experienced almost no symptoms throughout the whole first trimester except a missed period. Me being stupid and naive thought it was just coming really late (i went several months last year with no periods but at that time had not had any sex with anyone, period finally came after 4 months or so. I think stress/depressive state caused that) but now im 22 weeks in and hating myself every day i wake up. I tried taking a lotta vitamon c and some other herbs plus drinking a lot more when i started having suspicions but no luck. Even did some twisty exercises and other movements to knock anything loose.

I haven't dealt with this yet, but I've had fears and anxiety over my SO getting in trouble for something little since he's on probation, and whether or not the girl that lied about him in the first place will find out about our relationship and try to make him suffer more :(

I've imagined what I would do if that situation happens, andi would def try to keep busy in any way possible plus visit/call whenever necessary. Writing a journal helps me. I have lost loved ones in the past, my main coping mechanism was staying busy and being around other ppl pretty often. If you like exercise, indulge in that maybe.

Good luck and I hope it works out for you two soon. That is a difficult situation :("
mentalillness,fjgpki6,t3_fd7mtb,1583332712.0,"Thank you so much for posting your view on this and experience, I have ""ghosted"" (most refer to it as me doing a temporary disappearing act or the more understanding ones say taking a break) twice so far. Once i did but for only about two weeks and peoppe assumed I was busy with holiday season at work so it wasn't as big of a deal.

When I go through those phases and mental struggles, my mindset is completely different than the norm for me when it comes to being social and communicating. Parts of me seem to shut down and I lose hope about my future. Unfortunately I have let some things fall behind and I still feel the repercussions but I am just happy to feel better and have a better job now. 

Long story short i understand exactly where you are coming from. Some people  will never even come close to understanding those typea of struggles, and some unfortunately don't care to at all. 

We've all got each other in this subreddit though and can put ourselves into each other's shoes easier, I think.

Stay strong, take it day by day and when necessary hour by hour :)"
MentalHealthBabies,fjgp3um,t1_fjg1g3c,1583332408.0,"I appreciate that, if its a c section im fine with all the doctors. If anything might feel safer in case anything goes wrong.

Will my fiance look at me differently though  if he sees me cut up or anything? If so I'll ban him top heh its not like there's much to see. There's a lot more pressure for me if a lotta ppl are waiting outside even bc my parents are both dead and I'm not that close to my siblings (all half brothers). The half sibling i am closest with won't even call me back, and it has been about 3 or 4 monts since we last spoke. I know if i tell him this news he will probably give me some negative feedback so frankly i may not tell him until way after they're even born, chances are I won't see him for a year or mpre anyways. Sad but true."

MentalHealthBabies,fjgomnf,t1_fjfzwnr,1583332091.0,"Thank you, that does help. Is it odd if someone seeing my abdomen, chest etc operated on doesnt make me that nervous? I dont like my privates being viewed by strangers, add a clinical/medical room setting on top of that and it makes me want to cry a little. I can't help it, I've never liked the idea of showing certain parts of my body to strangers, not even doctors. It makes me feel weak and vulnerable.

I think im also getting anxious about money. I make a good income but my fiance is between jobs.. how convenient :/  

One other thing to add to all this... I'm anxious because my roommate/person who's name is on the mortgage is a depressed alcoholic with anxiety as well. I've been wanting to move out for a while but here is one of the cheapest options for me. I decided a while ago I wouldnt ever want to raise a child around her... however moving is stressful too plus i really dont have much of a savings built up at this point since I've struggled with my own mental health problems over the last 5 years.

FriendshipAdvice,fjachdm,t3_fbvzt8,1583170683.0,"It can be really difficult, I'm struggling to maintain and keep older friendships and I'm not even 30! I am close however (one more year). It makes me feel somewhat lonely at times, I feel like the only person who really takes time to spend time with me and wants to get to know me more is my fiance. 

I just recommend trying to message people you feel close or connected to at least once every other week. Maybe don't send them a long message, depending on if you know they get overwhelmed by that. I usually try to send periodic messages like ""I hope you are doing well!"" 

It seems remembering a person's birthday or any other big events for them helps. If there's a place you go to often, find other regular visitors for the same place and see if you can befriend them too. Joining clubs helps too I hear. Even a book club."
FriendshipAdvice,fjac0fq,t3_fc1up9,1583170407.0,"If they won't reply to you or reach out at all, that means they must be deeply involved with something or someone (sounds like their relationship) and maybe before that they were giving you space to enjoy your marriage. 

Maybe they have become.less social or went through a change or difficult times that has resulted in them not wanting or not being able to stay in touch with people. I know of several people with mental illnesses or that have gone through traumatic experiences, and they go through rough patches with communication with their friends/family.

Either way it hurts when it happens and typically causes me to feel confused."
FriendshipAdvice,fjabnym,t3_fc1dju,1583170233.0,"General conversations whether it is online, phone, or in person. Convos involve sharing experiences, memories, opinions, etc. 

Watching movies, taking walks/visiting places, going out to eat, etc. Thats my most common activities i did with my best friends before we all started working and now it seems near impossible to find good times to hang out.

Main thing with a best friend, for me, is that we feel comfortable telling each other even dark or unpopular opinion-ish stories/views. If i feel I am judged by a close friend for something I did or feel or think, I usually started distancing myself from them because they are showing me disrespect."

mentalillness,fj2s989,t1_fj2jucl,1582952303.0,"Definitely depends on where you go. I personally would never recommend any psych ward/behavioral health sponsored or run by St. E. My first experience was super awful... a few rude nurses and they had me in the same area as people with extreme anger and some drug issues, even though mine was for only depression/suicidal thoughts. I couldn't connect with anyone while I was there, mostly I felt fear.

The meds they prescribed me made me more numb and all I wanted to do was sleep, even after being on them for a while. Second time was at a different location, it was better and even the dr I had seen the first time from a few years before didn't have as bad or careless of an attitude. Still didn't help me personally but it encouraged me to better myself and some emotional aspects of my life/thinking styles that will keep me far, far away from.those places."
psychotherapy,fj2r16q,t3_favnh2,1582951230.0,"I burned out in my old work position, but i wasn't in it for nearly as long as you.

Combine that with trying to keep up with reports/emails, some of which has deadlines, plus phone chats, calls, voicemails, online tickets, and the needs for various managers. I left over a year after falling into pretty bad depression/being burnt out... I'm happy to say I waited long enough to leave with a really good reputation, however it took me a few months of me time, not working a lot, and getting plenty of outdoor time before I felt much better. 

Good luck, I hope you don't feel the after effects of extreme career burnout for very much longer."
