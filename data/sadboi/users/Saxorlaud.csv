Another thing is, Vinny said a while back that there was a song with vocals inspired by ""Something in the Way,"" so I wonder if the new single will be that one or not.

A March/April album release seems likely, since Vinny said it ""might"" leak into early Spring. I feel like this new single will be the final single before release, but that probably depends on whether or not the album needs to be delayed like AL was."

parents love their children because they're a mark of their own reproductive success which makes the evolution signals in their brain beep in a happy way.

girlfriends/boyfriends love the validation that they get by having a romantic partner -- they can believe that they are a successful living thing and have potential to complete their purpose as a machine of nature.

friends love their friends for similar reasons -- the presence of friends fulfills a social urge inherent in all people and makes them feel good. often people will also love their friends' company so they can have someone lesser to compare themselves to constantly assure themselves that they are doing alright. hell, maybe they keep you around because picking out all of your flaws is a source of group entertainment.

whenever somebody claims to care about how you feel or does something to make you feel better, it's just them acting on their desire to keep you in their lives so they can continue that self-fulfilling relationship they have with you. it's like a cute house cat that purrs beside your ear in a way reminiscent of a baby; they want to be fed and they've figured out the way to get your attention.
