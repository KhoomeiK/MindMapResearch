hyperphantasia,fqt2bwp,t3_gkso4f,1589627571.0,"Answers to the title questions.

1/2. Kind of, yes. I can fully immerse myself in my visions so much that I am completely unaware of my surroundings.

3. Yes. The odd thing is that it is kind of automatic. If you gave me a passage of a book I would automatically immerse myself. Yet when I’m aware of it, I can’t do it. I’ll explain below.

It does feel like I view my visions on a separate screen. But only two can run at once. The real and the unreal. I don’t have multiple screens. Only the two.

Most of the time I can only ever view one at a time. I can see either what is there or what is in my mind. But only if I do it without realising.

Say I fall into a daydream. I would only see what is in the daydream. I wouldn’t see the world around me. Yet as soon as I am aware I am daydreaming, I snap back into reality and find it hard to get back into that fully immersive daydream.

This is where the double screen comes in. When I try and force myself to see using my mind’s eye, the visions kind of overlay onto reality. This might not help, but this is how I see it: I see two separate things on a single screen. I try and impose a false view onto a true view.

The same but slightly different applies for reading. I can subconsciously read the words when view the ‘false’ screen. Yet, as soon as I know I am looking at the ‘false’ screen, I can then only see either the words or the vision. Which stops me from being able to immerse myself in that world.

So to be able to solely view the ‘false’ screen, I need to be in a flow state of sorts. If I do it while not in a flow state, it requires much more mental power for something that is half to a quarter of the quality of normal vision that is overlayed with reality.

I hope that made remote sense, I feel like I went on a bit of a ramble. :)"

MBTI: Introversion/Extroversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, Judging/Perceiving. e.g. INTP

The Big Five (also known as OCEAN): Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism. It's a scale instead of absolute letters like MBTI. e.g. O 89%, C 31%, E 14%, A 28%, N 41%.

16p tried to fuse the two together: I/E = Extraversion (Higher scores = E), S/N = Openness (Higher scores = N), T/F = Agreeableness (Higher scores = F), J/P = Conscientiousness (Higher scores = J). Seeing as one was left over they created (? I don't know about this) another category: Assertive and Turbulent. A/T = Neuroticism (Higher scores = T).

Now this in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing, but not only do they completely leave out Jungian cognitive functions, they deny their existence (go to the chatroom rules 'Jungian cognitive functions are not supported by our research').

ainbow,fnvq7ya,t1_fnvf1yu,1587301801.0,"I am agender. Maybe I can explain it to you.

Agender is when someone doesn’t identify with any gender. They don’t experience gender or believe it is irrelevant.

It is different for everyone but this is how I experience agender. I was born female. I grew up like to like things girls like (probably because of social pressures) but I never felt like my gender mattered. I could never see the point to gender. I identified as a cis female until roughly a year ago when I heard about non binary. I dug a little further and came across the term agender (people who don’t feel or experience gender). I finally found people like me.

Now dysphoria. Some agender people get a great deal of dysphoria while others don’t. I personally don’t get a lot of body dysphoria but I get a great deal of social dysphoria. While I do wish my hips were narrower, my shoulders broader and chest flatter, it doesn’t cause my a great deal of distress like some people. But I hate being seen as a woman in social situations. While I am not trans, I am *much* more comfortable being seen as a man instead of a woman. But best of all, would be people seeing me without gender at all. My pronouns matter to me a lot to me to help people see me without gender. My preferred name is very gender neutral.

Other people’s body dysphoria may come from the fact their body is heavily gendered. It reminds them of a gender they don’t have, or wish they could get rid of.

It could have stemmed from the fact I am pansexual as well. If I don’t see gender in other people (or believe other peoples gender is irrelevant to my attraction to them) then I also struggle to find gender in myself.

I hope this helped explain :)"

MaladaptiveDreaming,fjans0l,t3_fcekng,1583177124.0,"Yeah. I’ve kept a ‘daydream diary’ (if you will) since around 11. It contains the basic plot, characters and any triggers (music and songs etc.). I keep them arranged in date order and it is really interesting to see how my style has evolved even within 4 years.

When I was 11 it was about tv shows, movies and the characters within those that I was obsessed about. I would imagine myself with them.

Towards the later end of 13, I used to have many daydreams about my own stories. Fantasy has already been mentioned. I also had daydreams in sci-fi, dystopias and slice-of-life not including myself. The plots were complex; characters had complex relationships, full in-depth personalities, (mostly but not always) tragic backstories; and I would sometimes draw character concept art to ‘focus’ my design (they could vary wildly between daydreaming sessions).

Now at almost 15 I am going to be totally honest. I still have the daydreams I had at 13 but now they focus around myself and my better life more so. They are also starting to get a lot more erotic and sexual. Mostly these aren’t too bad, but often rape happens and other forms of violence and abuse. More often than I’d like to admit, I’ve had panic attacks because of my daydreams. They also tend to take a twist around what’s on my mind or what I’m obsessed with at the minute.

As for the future, I think they will focus more and more on escaping my shitty life into a perfect world I’ve constructed in my head.

pansexual,ffu1qcm,t1_ffta6po,1580232609.0,"How old is your little brother? If he’s younger than 8-9 you can teach him not to make fun of people who like the same sex.

There was a story on /r/lgbt about a teacher whose 6 yo student thought he was gay. Some of the other students made fun of him but the teacher told them there is nothing wrong with liking the same gender.

My brother is 12 and I came out to him about a year ago. He still doesn’t fully understand but I know he’s still supportive.

Depending on how close you are to your brother I would say tell him first. I would say the way your siblings react would be similar to that of your parents unless he is really different from them."

pansexual,fffwpz8,t3_etd0hn,1579893470.0,"It seems like there’s a small bit of confusion in the comments. I’ll try my best to clear it up:

Pansexual: Attraction to someone regardless of gender. Many pansexual call themselves ‘genderblind’

Polyamorous: Being involved in or have a desire to have *completely consensual* relationships with multiple people

Polysexual: Attraction to some, but not all genders. An example: attracted to women, non-binaries and trans men but not cis men, if that makes sense
 
Another one worth noting: Omnisexual. Similar to pansexual but you are completely aware of the person’s gender but don’t care.

Hope this helped clear some things up"

I’m pansexual myself with an aromantic asexual friend and she says that she doesn’t mind people asking her romantic preferences (she has none but at least it’s now known).

If he has preferences towards your gender then use that INTP honesty we are famous for. Tell him how you feel. There was a girl I liked, I told her how I feel, she said she wasn’t interested, it was fine and I said I’d cool it off (we’re friends).

Be honest. As an INTP this shouldn’t be much of a problem. Ask about his romantic preferences, if they fall in your favour, tell him how you feel. I know it’s a bit more complex than that but this is essentially what you need to do."
