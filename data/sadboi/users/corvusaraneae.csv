AoNoExorcist,fp5ibnd,t3_gb3koa,1588330423.0,"Interesting questions... 


1. I suppose it has something to do with the interest of the mangaka as well as the subject matter of their manga. Kato-sensei recently went on a trip to the Vatican just to do research so I can imagine that's one example. Other mangaka usually pick religions to work with their subject matter if it's necessary. As for why they blend multiple religious beliefs... well... because that's what's visible in the world? Japan has a combination of shinto, buddhist and christian communities, after all. 

2. I'm not religious, per se. Actually into demonolatry. It's a little funny seeing certain names from the goetia floating around (cue me screaming about how Belial is just another name for Satan and why is he just a butler I have very complicated feelings toward His Infernal Majesty) but I suppose it's the same feeling a Catholic gets from watching Saint Young Men. (Also that's a good watch I highly recommend it.)

3. Maybe? Japan doesn't have to deal with the backlash of the easily offended, at least..."

See, the difference between that and your autism example is that one is blatant and one isn't. Most of the headcanon surrounding sexuality isn't as overt as ""has sex with men, enjoys it, isn't attracted to women"". It's mostly stemmed from a character not showing any attraction to anyone. Heck, shipping two characters sometimes stems from them being close friends and far be it from me to rag on anyone's ships. They can ship whatever and whoever they want but the minute they claim it's canon and start yelling at people who disagree is when they're crossing a line. 

But isn't insisting someone is something because of certain traits just stereotyping? Some traits of autism can also manifest in someone who isn't well socialized, after all. Are they autistic or are they just awkward?"

Agreed. I just got it a few weeks ago and I feel it's less about Link's progression and more about your own progression. You emerge from the Plateau just swinging around a stick and whacking around fodder enemies. Eventually you pick up a shield and learn shield mechanics. And then you learn to time your dodges. And you mix up archery and paragliding. Then you take down your first guardian. Your game progression isn't tied to Link's level or picking up items. It's tied to your progression and your understanding of the game's mechanics."
