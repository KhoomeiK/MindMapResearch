Doomers,fiuel0h,t3_f9x7km,1582739912.0,Same and you too buddy
Persona5,fiu82os,t3_f9w51y,1582736734.0,I love it
weed,fi7aon9,t3_f6vvsc,1582217686.0,I will also say it * looks *like a drink. Possibly a drink mix like mio?
chubby,fd2s2nm,t3_ejxtbl,1578151125.0,Phenomenal. Plain and simple
BPD,fclytvy,t3_ehv6wb,1577759824.0,"It may have something to do with it!  Could be a sort of coping mechanism also.  Personally, however, I still love everyone I've ever considered my self to love in a way.  Aint no stopping the fierce force of that shit."
BPD,f81ey0z,t3_dy6vjt,1574164861.0,"I like how it looks, maybe I could keep myself using this one.  Signed up and eagerly await trying it out!  Thanks for all your work on this HeroJournal"
DBZDokkanBattle,f44mszu,t3_djeos4,1571355282.0,Lmao fantastic turn around
AzurLewd,f3iaikq,t3_dfx4q7,1570934211.0,I can't properly explain why I like Baltimore so much but this is glorious
BPD,f3eu4ah,t1_f3et43y,1570885479.0,"I appreciate you bot, but I was using a somewhat distant example from my past and am doing fine currently.  Keep up the good work"
BPD,f3etwcp,t1_f3etc7e,1570885389.0,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to imply not to be honest, just to be more tactful and avoid direct reference to wanting to die when possible.  It seems to startle people is all."
BPD,f3et3it,t1_f3eqq1q,1570885079.0,"Try to form it in to less dramatic terms, I suppose.  For example: Say you work six days a week and are having car trouubles or something that have caused extra stress.  You could be feeling like ""God if I don't get a day to relax I'm going to kill myself to escape.  I just want to die so I don't have to keep doing this"" but to say to someone who asks how you doing, maybe it could be ""My busy schedule has me stretched so thin I feel like I'm breaking.  It's a  real bad time lately.""  

That's something I'm trying to do, at least."
chubby,f3alq9i,t3_dgbmzw,1570779144.0,Judging from the angle imma help you have a seat and enjoy a snack lmao

DBZDokkanBattle,f39nr0r,t1_f39ggn3,1570752124.0,Good time to use the exchange command?  When Nappa gets to 50% health he can exchange for vegeta?  And by exchange I mean get murdered by (think Bojack in Legends if you play that too lol)
BigBootyGoTHICCgf,f39mic8,t1_f39ifp4,1570751352.0,Todays MVP!!! holy crap

AzureLane,f32nm8d,t3_dfdgw0,1570619412.0,"Anyone else unable to get past the loading screen?  Im stuck looking at the road trip gals and while i could admire Essex all day, i prefer her in action lol"
BPD,f1rgkeq,t3_daniz6,1569715398.0,"I hear you.  This is such a struggle and no one really seems to take the time to try to consider how difficult it is

smashbros,ezx4yie,t3_d2vzu3,1568232168.0,Yeah its really a pain.  I'll off myself to avoid this too.  Sans bringing the rise of Mii gunner made this so much more likely to run into it feels like. Agony!

DBZDokkanBattle,etgd21w,t1_etgcq9z,1562788413.0,Thanks for clarifying.  Sadly not the one i thought we were talking about.  I shouldve clarified my global only dokkaner status.  Maybe ill get lucky when he does come however.  Thanks again

afkarena,ersvt33,t1_ers8ped,1561225515.0,"I beg to differ slightly. I have a legendary+ lucius Belinda and Thane and the latter is doing pretty well for me in midgame, to the point of almost carrying if he gets a lot of luck. Hes in the middle of the others level wise."

BPD,eo8jv11,t3_bqxeu4,1558368237.0,Idk if its bpd but this goes for me.  Like... in a bad mood or a rough situation I can summon power if I'm dating someone by thinking about how amazingly lovely they are in whatever ways they are.  I'm automatically more confident if someone known to me finds me attractive in a given situation as well
