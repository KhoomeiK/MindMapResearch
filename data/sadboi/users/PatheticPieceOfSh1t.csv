How you ""move on"" might depend on you, but for me, it would mean to delete their phone number and never talk to them again. 

It really fucking hurts, but it's only worse if you delay things, especially if you watch them move on without you :("
depression,f9izeko,t3_e5c4ju,1575350397.0,"Sorry to hear this :( I can definitely relate. Loving someone who doesn't love you back is such a fucking pain in the ass (sorry for my crudeness). Especially if you've never actually experienced what it's like to have someone love you. 

And then the depression comes, and you get jaded, and angry like you said, and it feels like you're going to be alone forever because you're not even in a mindset where you could open up to someone and allow them into your life because your so scared of getting hurt again and that mindset just spirals into a never-ending cycle of self-doubt, pity, hopelessness, and loneliness....

I donno how much of this you relate to, but... I do get where you're coming from. Wish I had advice but all I can say definitively is that these feelings aren't abnormal."

depression,f9i30r7,t3_cml6ni,1575327065.0,"Cleaned my apartment yesterday and did a bunch of meal prep. I really want to get out of this rut I've been stuck in but I already know that any attempt to fix myself is so tenuous. I'm just going to fall back into old patterns...

I try to think about what got me in this position, because I want to learn from this experience and hopefully fix whatever's broken but the more I think about it, the more I feel like it's just my shitty personality that's to blame. Something intrinsic to who I am. Something that I couldn't change if I wanted to.

I don't think I'm going to grow from this experience. I don't think I'm even going to make it out alive, and maybe that's for the best."
