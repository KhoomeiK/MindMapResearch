My experience is that most people who struggle with their existence in this way feel they are a huge burden to their loved ones and feel the world would be a better place without them in it. This is probably the most selfless motivation I can think of for people that are extremely troubled .

AskReddit,erzv2hn,t3_c53eqa,1561453161.0,"I was on a long solo road trip and stayed just one night at a campground in New Mexico. I hadn’t bothered to scout out where the bathrooms were, because I had gotten into the habit of peeing outside, and it would only be one night after all.  Unfortunately, the next morning I woke up and urgently and had to do a doo doo. I was sad to realize it was going to be a slippery one, so I had to quickly improvise because I certainly wasn’t going to find the camp toilet in time.

This was the desert, so the landscape was filled with rocks and cacti, but not dirt. I couldn’t dig a cat hole in this terrain.

So I grabbed a couple plastic grocery bags I had stashed in my car, hid as best I could behind some cacti in the bright sun of the morning and start doing my unpleasant duty, squatting over the bags to catch my crap, 

Then I hear a car drive by and slow down not twenty feet from where I am. I hear some clanking and peek around to see a park ranger emptying the trash can from the adjacent campsite. 

I immediately squeeze shut as best I can while I wait for the ranger to empty the neighbor’s trash, and then mine. It was probably a minute, but it felt like a flipping hour. 

Finally he moves on and I can finish my sweet, stinky release as gracefully as possible (which of course is not graceful at all). I clean up, tie up the bag as tightly as possible, and drop it into the freshly emptied trash receptacle, to bake in the hot desert sun all day.  I felt bad for the ranger who had to empty the bin the next day.

Somehow I also got covered in cactus needles, despite my best efforts."
