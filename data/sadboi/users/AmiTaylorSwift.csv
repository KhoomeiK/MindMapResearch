unitedkingdom,fo2hxbe,t1_fo2glth,1587463101.0,I agree. You can't really account for ambiguity in your figures when carehomes are where the virus is thriving due to elderly and inadequate PPE from the beginning. Also older people being sent home from hospital to die at home. It isnt like the unrecorded Corona deaths are outliers.
unitedkingdom,fo2hs0l,t1_fo2fsdd,1587462939.0,No. My mom is a nurse in the community and she has been out to confirm loads of Corona deaths outside of hospitals e.g in care homes or at the patients home (sometimes people are sent home from hospital to die peacefully ) and on her first one when she registered the death she asked if there's a marker so that it counts as a Coronavirus death and they said no. It's counted as a normal death. Were in West Midlands so not sure about other counties. The government might say the exact figure but that figure is not necessarily accurate.
unitedkingdom,fo2hkk7,t1_fo2gjir,1587462711.0,"If numbers are lower, they can justify their lack of response. For example if the number was 5000 higher they'd have to provide more beds, resources, PPE, etc. And maybe more strict lockdown measures.  My mom is a nurse in the community and says the death toll should be thousands higher. Care homes are rife with it and if somebody dies outside of hospital from Corona it's not marked as a Corona death."

CatAdvice,fiy7rph,t1_fiy5ay1,1582834192.0,"Thanks so much for your reply! Since I read that if a cat hisses you should remove yourself from the situation because you 1) show them that hissing isn't a good way to make friends and 2) give them the space they need to feel secure, I've been doing that. When she hissed and bit me I left the room for a while.

When she bats at me, is it to see if I get aggressive? Or is it to see if I respect her boundaries? I've not stroked her yet, I want her to come to me and maybe rub herself on me before I touch her. I've held my hand out to her which she has sniffed and another time has hissed at."
Accutane,fi7unm4,t3_f6v2v4,1582228486.0,Me too. Just finished my third course and I'm waiting for the red hyperpigmentation to fade but I'm noticing so many ice picks.
yoga,fi7s068,t1_fi4wsup,1582227095.0,"I agree. Since getting back into yoga I see lots of recommended instagram posts where people will show a ""bad"" pose like downward dog with crosses everywhere like pointing to bent knees in down dog. It makes me so mad. It's better to slowly work on a pose and slowly build strength and flexibility than cram yourself into a position and injure yourself. That might look like knees bent for a few weeks or months, who cares! You're getting there :)"
