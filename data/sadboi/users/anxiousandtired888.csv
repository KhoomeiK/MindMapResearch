I loved the first season of GG (season one Derena was cute asf), but after that it became a bit too extra for me personally. I just couldn't root for many of the characters anymore. Riverdale is sort of getting to be like that for me (just my opinion, I dont mean to offend anyone who likes the newer seasons!). The GG reveal was disappointing to me, too. 

PLL was another big one (Haleb was my OTP). I watched the entire show (I was hooked), but man, the final A reveal was... well, it was something else. Like, for all people roast Riverdale, the final A reveal was laughably awful. Not satisfying at all."

riverdale,fo10rdp,t3_g50mo1,1587423451.0,"Tbh, I have always really wanted more of Jughead and Ronnie. Jughead and Veronica both come from shady families. I think having Jughead realize Veronica isn't just some spoiled rich girl, and that her parents actually emotionally abused her and continue to manipulate her, would be a really good plot. Jugheads pretty blunt, and I think Veronica needs someone to tell her how it is: just because her dad is sick, doesn't mean she has to forgive him for abusing her. And Veronica could sort of get a glimpse into Jugheads life as he is someone who has been poor, and made his own way in the world. At this point, Im not even sure I want Bughead and Varchie to be endgame anymore. I personally am not really a fan of Betty or Archie right now, but that could change within the next two episodes. I hope Veronica gets more character development - she has a lot of potential, and its so sad to see how she constantly gets shitty plotlines that result in 0 development."
riverdale,fnuutq7,t1_fntt103,1587271668.0,"I agree with a lot of your points! Before I share mine, I just wanted to say (in reference to your lead balloon comment), people aren't supposed to downvote just because they disagree with your opinion. Downvotes are for people who are being rude, disrespectful, or aren't adding anything to the conversation. So, with that out of the way, heres what I'll add:

RAS has allegedly said he always planned for a Barchie endgame (which sounds like it'll go over as well as the Ted/Robin endgame in HIMYM...), but I am just absolutely appalled he thought the right way to go about starting their romance was by making them cheat. Bughead, while it definitely isn't the healthiest ship, is the fandoms most popular. By having Betty and Archie cheat... I just think fans of Varchie and Bughead would have been more receptive had Betty and Archie not started because they cheated. Had Varchie and Bughead broken up, I think Barchie would have gone over better.

To me, Barchie is pretty unhealthy as well. I mean, the cheating aside (because thats just a shitty thing to do), it seems driven by nostalgia for simpler times. The Archie Betty is daydreaming about, and the Betty Archie is daydreaming about, both are gone. Betty is absolutely nothing like the person she was in season one, when she was head over heels for Archie. Archie is nothing like he was in season one, either (remember when he used to make music?). Betty and Archie both seem so overwhelmed by their trauma they ended up running back to eachother because that was familiar. Regardless, they both have developed into different people, and I can't see the relationship working out. Betty has much more in common with Jughead, and if Veronica could get her head out of her fathers ass, she actually was a very supportive girlfriend to Archie (with the gym and what not). 

However, I think Varchie needs to solve the Hiram problem before getting back together, and I agree with a lot of the points you made about Bughead (the fact that their parents are dating as well weirds me out). The ships were getting stale, though, so seeing Betty and Archie together might be interesting. I really hope we get more serious character development, and I seriously hope for once characters actually face repercussions for their actions (meaning Jughead and Veronica dont forgive Archie and Betty after two episodes), but given Hiram seems to be out of the woods now that he's sick, I doubt the cheating thing will be handled well. We'll see next episode, I guess!"
riverdale,fnute9y,t3_g3ora6,1587270593.0,"I think a lot of the kid/parent relationships are way more unhealthy than the romantic ones. 

Veronica and her parents... the thing that makes me unbelievably angry about this is that Veronica had so much potential. She could have developed from Hirams angelic, spoiled daughter to an independent woman capable of thinking for herself and calling out emotional abuse. Hiram and Hermione both have been incredibly terrible parents. Hiram literally tried to ruin her, not to mention he tried to kill her boyfriend. And Hermione stopped being there for Veronica after season one. She was childish, too. Veronica even says to Archie that her parents messed her up so badly she doesnt know how to properly emote. She couldnt tell him she loved him because of her parents. That was a good plot! The writers should have kept going with that. Have Veronica open up more about how her parents just bought her things but never spent any time with her or eachother, and have her realize that they emotionally abused her and abused Archie. But... No, that would take too much work, so instead, they decided on giving Hiram a ""get out of jail free card"" because he's sick in the show. Veronica was my favorite character in season one, she has so much potential. 

Also, Betty and Alice. Alice has done so many shitty things to Betty. She was controlling as all hell in season one, and the stunt she pulled at the farm was unbelievably selfish. She basically decided to abandon her teenage daughter and, not only that, she hurt Betty over and over again to keep up her act. Also, Alice dating Bettys boyfriends dad... Thats weird. Like, Jughead and Betty being together and sharing a sibling was already weird for me, but they work so well together I could look past it (they also didnt know about it when they started dating). Alice and FP dating while they're dating? That made it weird for me. If FP and Alice got married, Jughead and Betty would be in-laws... Not trying to bash Bughead, I ship it, I just think the family dynamics are a bit unhealthy. 

Archie was the only one with a relatively healthy home life, and his parents went through a seemingly rough divorce."

When I saw they were going with the affair plotline for Barchie, while I cant say I expected anything more clever from Riverdale at this point, I was still so disappointed.

mentalhealth,fnf82o8,t3_g15o9l,1586903136.0,"My highschool experience was literally like a movie. In the worst. way. possible. Seriously, it was the thunderdome.  My friends were awful to me. They belittled me, they would gaslight me, and hanging out with them always gave me anxiety. They even would say I ""used my anxiety as an excuse"" to not go to hangouts. 

I wasn't the healthiest friend either in highschool. I was dramatic and I had a lot of undiagnosed mental illnesses and a lot of issues in my personal-life that caused me to be toxic too. I'm by no means saying I was a perfect person, I wish I could go back and change a lot of the shit I said and did. At 15, cattiness and dramatics are normal, and a lot of what they did I can forgive and forget because I did a lot of shit too. But my friends decided to paint me as the bad guy when, in reality, a lot of the shit that went down was provoked, and they were just as bad. Something that my friends did that I would never, ever have done to them? One of my friends went to a party. I had broken up with a guy who really liked me because the spark had died, and I was emotionally unavailable.  It was unfair to stay in the relationship at the time. He was really torn up about it, but I still stand by my decision to break it off. Anyways, it shouldn't have been a big deal, but his friends made it one. They harrassed me and called me all sorts of names (ironically, because the one friend literally was a cheater. He cheated on so many girls). My friends had been there for me and said they were on my side. Then, we had a little get together and my best friend turns to me and tells me that she went to a party where my exs friends were, and all of them talked shit about me. She said she went along with it because she just ""wanted to know what they were saying about me."" I still cry about it to this day. I have never, ever been backstabbed like that before. Ever. And I would never EVER have done that to her, or anyone else. Its been 4 years. I thought we were going to be best friends for the rest of our lives. I havent talked to her since, and she never apologised. 

Sorry, that was longwinded. I had to get that off my chest. Just incase anyone was wondering why I had trust issues..."
socialskills,fnerpoo,t3_g10mna,1586894658.0,"I was in the same boat last year. I have really bad anxiety, Im a people pleaser who hates confrontation, and I have no self esteem so I never EVER think anyone would flirt with me. If you're reading this and thinking ""damn, she missed some obvious hints,"" thats what everyone else said too. I really was oblivious. Anyways, Im a girl, was working reception for a year to earn some money before going to University, and a guy started working in the summer who was my age and actually went to my high school (though we never bumped into each other there). We became friends, he added me on facebook and followed my instagram, and I saw nothing wrong with it (he followed a lot of other co workers as well). One day he left a note on my desk telling me to smile more. I thought it was a joke, and figured he was just trying to be funny, so I laughed and thanked him for the note when he brought it up. That night, he messaged me on facebook. He told me he thought I was beautiful, and thought we had a lot of chemistry. I messaged him back and apologized profusely for leading him on, but I was honest with him. I told him I don't like dating co-workers, and that I only saw him as a friend. The issue with that turned into him refusing to take no for an answer. He continued to ask me out and even tried to pressure co-workers into getting me to go out with him. 

Anyways, I would say the best thing to do would be to be honest. Tell her you just see her as a friend. Its really difficult, but its the truth. If she continues to pursue you, tell someone. A different male coworker actually told one of my managers about the coworker with a crush on me because he was making him feel uncomfortable (constantly pressuring him to talk to me and try and change my mind). I hate confrontation and am so anxious, I didnt go to my manager when I should have. If she makes you uncomfortable and doesn't respect your answer (that you just want to be friends), please tell someone! You deserve to feel comfortable and safe at work."

sleep,fn5dltg,t3_fzef15,1586662111.0,"Hey, I get this! Actually, everyone in my family does. Its normal, I believe about half the population gets it at least once. Its called confusional arousals. I get this sometimes paired with a panic attack, one time I started banging on my wall because I seriously had no idea where I was. Its like you wake up with amnesia. My mom once got on and she did something similar: she woke up confused and disoriented, and then she ended up tripping and falling down the stairs. My dad had one last night and scared the shit out of me. He came down stairs and was talking gibberish to me. 

Dont google symptoms - sometimes google comes up with much scarier sleep disorders! I was diagnosed by both a doctor and I got a second opinion from a sleep doctor. Im no doctor, however, what your explaining sounds pretty much verbatim as to what I get save for the fact you arent in a panic attack.  Confusional arousals tend to happen in times of stress or anxiety - mine are almost exclusively triggered by panic. (Thankfully, I have been 2 months +1 week free of them!). Also, alchohol can trigger them. Not everyone remembers them, however, a lot do, and also, it is normal to sleepwalk during them (though sometimes we just sit in our beds confused and then go back to sleep!) 

I have started sleeping with my door open. A light shines through the door. It isnt super bright so it doesnt keep me up, however, now I dont wake up in complete darkness. Like I said, I have now been free of my confusional arousal + nocturnal panic episodes for two months! 

TL,DR: sounds like confusional arousals! Maybe you're stressed about something? They are common and normal, however, they can be unsettling - take it from someone who knows!"

As an activist one of the number one rules me and my friends have is 1. We don't know everything, we need to be capable of listening and learning and 2.

I found it really ironic. People on twitter were straight up assholes to me. Like, people were actually bullying me and, because being an asshole is apparently funny on twitter, people were straight up rude to everyone. Just seems ironic is all. Like, the people who actually told me to ""shut up"" and, amongst other things, that I am an idiot for being a Taylor Swift fan (and of course, since people on twitter think roasting is the same as being a straight up prick, people started ganging up on me because I like Taylor Swift) are the same people who claim to be activists and allys... a girl shared the suicide hotline on her twitter but yet she bullied me, a girl with numerous diagnosed (not twitter self diagnosed) mental illnesses (and who used to be suicidal) off of twitter. Just a little bit ironic. 

And what you said about people being way too emotional is right on the nose. One of the things that happened with me was: a girl made a pretty rude assumption about something and I politely corrected her. She then started insulting me, calling me an idiot  and drug Taylor Swift into it too. Aside from the rather obvious logical fallacies, it just came across as really immature.

I can confirm, while reddit has the reputation of being all knowing, its not, and it is never a good idea to self diagnose from reddit, quora or any other website. Take it from someone who asked a redditor and self diagnosed myself with something I dont have! 

As far as advice goes, mine is he does need help. Im mentally ill, and I didnt realize how bad my OCD was until this year. I was having nightly breakdowns. It sounds to me like he, at the very least, needs a professional to help him process the tragedy of losing his mother. I obviously will not offer a medical diagnosis, but I definitely would suggest going to get help."

I dont want other people spending hundreds of dollars talking to different doctors and a sleep doctor just because of self diagnosis' on reddit.

I guess just recognizing that we are dealing with irrational thoughts is the firsf step. I am starting therapy this thursday, but if you cant afford it, sometimes just ranting to a friend or family member can really help. Journalling can help too.

Im not relying on fact, Im using google (which there are many articles on why google is NOT a reliable source)."" 

I cant agree with the ""is this normal"" posts being bad, though. It probably is bad for me to post and look at them. Rather than asking for a diagnosis, say ""should I talk to a GP about this or no?"" 

I over analyze everything. I over analyze the way I breathe when I wake up in the morning. Going to see my doctor for every ""symptom"" I have would mean I'd go see him every week. I agree, we shouldn't be offering any diagnosis what so ever. I can say from experience, being self diagnosed by another redditor with a scary condition feels like a false positive. I would just comment ""yes, go see your doc"" or ""I dont think its concerning, but you can go see your doc if you want to."""

I remember my friend decided to try running because I talk it up so much, she text me absolutely furious because she HATED it. It did nothing for her. She thought I was elaborately pranking her or something. I love running, but there are plenty of days I cant bring myself to run, and there are days it doesnt do much for me either. Fitness is a form of self care, but it isnt a cure. Also, everyones mental illness is different, what helps me might not help someone else, wish more people understood that.

You can survive this, and one day you will be responding to someone online and reassuring them they will get through their worst days just like I am you.

You dont have to be super graphic of course, just kind of explain your fears.
