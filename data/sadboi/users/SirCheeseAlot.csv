Trying to heal and go to therapy and exercise and do all the things we have to do, is like putting more bricks in the bag. Eventually the work will allow us to drop the bag all together, but until then...

CPTSD,fmvtrz8,t1_fmupvmq,1586430602.0,"The basic gist is, something in your past has conditioned you in a way that is causing you to have negative feelings toward being creative. Parts of you don't want you to find out what is holding you back. They have their own reasons. You need to address their reasons, and get them to co-operate by stepping aside and allowing you to speak directly to that part you hide away. The creative (perhaps child) part. 

I wrote about this process as an answer to another question someone else asked. The principles are the same no matter whether its fear of people or fear of being creative.

""I am still working on it, but I made some headway last night I could share with you. Im trying to think of how much detail to share, but context seems pretty important so..

I have been homeless for years. Do to the virus outbreak. I went to stay in my moms basement. Its actually been nice. Its been remodeled into a mother in law suite. SO for the first time in forever I can use the bathroom when I want. Shower every morning. Store healthy fresh food I have cooked and prepared in the fridge. I have a space to exercise. Access to power and internet. I have a bed, and a door to lock. It is quite here. All these things have been absent for years for me.

I have been here for a week and a half. The first few days I was kind of in shock, and couldn't internalize my environment. Then for a week I felt great! I was working on several projects I had been wanting to do, but couldn't. I was exercising. I was feeling confident and alive. Then last night, I heard my moms latest husband upstairs being critical of her. That confident healthy happy outgoing part of me, disappeared, and another part took over. That was a one of my child parts, that I keep in the basement of my mind.

Since I have been doing IFS, and mindfulness, and becoming more and more aware of internal changes. I was able to be consciously aware of the shift. I felt small, I felt frightened, I felt I had to step lightly, and be so quite. I felt a need to hide.

My first instinct was to try to rationalize, and speak logically to that part. Try to say, theres nothing going on, you are over reacting, stop being like this. That was another part of me. A manager part. I asked him to step aside. I knew I couldn't use cold logic here. My core self was aware at this time, so I was able to see all these parts trying to go online and push this exile back in the basement. The next part was dissociation. It tried to take the thoughts from my mind, and pull me out of my body so I wouldn't think about this stuff. I asked him to step aside. I said, ""we are in a safe place now. Its a good opportunity to talk with this part. If we get to emotional you can come back"". So he agreed to step aside.

I was sitting in the dark, and I heard some loud steps upstairs which made me flashback to the men my mom brought home, being drunk and pounding on my door. That child part jerked in fear. The dissociation wanted to step in, but my core self had this. The core self was able to see that scared boy alone in his room, and I felt tears in my eyes. I didn't stop the emotion. I just let myself feel immense empathy for him, and what he went through.

Then I went into his room and took his hand, and we went and got his sister, and I took them to the arcade and gave them a bunch of quarters to play games. I stood right by them, and guarded them, so they could just relax and play. Then later, I told them that if they were ever scared. I am always here, and I will come get them, and protect them.

Thats how I am working on inner child work. I hope that helps some."""
CPTSD,fmsbl0h,t3_fx619r,1586351865.0,"I am a creative person at heart, but I avoid creative things. It doesnt make sense, unless I start to think about why I avoid them. You are a few steps ahead in healing. You recognize why you are struggling to do what makes you happy. The next step is to learn to embrace those alive parts of you, that you keep locked in the basement of your mind. I have found IFS(Internal Family Systems) to be a useful approach to working on this topic."
