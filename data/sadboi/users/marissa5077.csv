Staying alive is the most important thing becuase it is true, like they say, that things will not be like this forever and you will get better. Probably not fixed, and that’s okay but better and healthy and happy. 

I’m rambling sorry I’m high (on weed, it’s my life save) please take care, take to a counselor, your supports, practice self care. You will beat this tough patch, I believe in you. Xx"

Advice,fqtkb1t,t3_gkveg0,1589640673.0,"Hey pal. First off, I don’t think you are a horrible personal. Yes, you’ve done some bad things when you were younger and you have to live with that, but that is the past. It is not your fault your mom got hurt. 

There is a saying something along the lines of “accept the things you cannot change and change the things you can”. Radical acceptance. You can’t change how you behaved in middle school and that you bullied kids a bit. It’s over. It’s done with. What you need to do now is assure that that never happens again. Work on yourself, it is okay to put yourself first and be “selfish” sometimes. Have you considered seeing a therapist? I’ve been seeing one for years and it has greatly helped me learn to love and accept myself and my past faults. You have the ability to change things and make things better. You control how you treat people and how you fill up your time. It may be beneficial for you to find some way to give back to needy people, it can be very eye opening. 

Again, I don’t think you are a terrible, selfish person. I think you are someone who is very very hard on themselves and feels incredible guilt for past events. If you felt no remorse you would not be as good a person. It is good to admit you need help so please don’t be afraid to do that, talk to a close family member/friend and look into possibly getting a counselor. Also check out www.7cupsoftea.com they provide people with free online support from trained (not liscensed therapists) listeners that could help in the short term, but it can’t compare to a real counselor. Best of luck to you man, things WILL get better for you. It may be hard to see that now, but trust me. I’ve been at rock bottom and things got better, they will for you too <3"
BPD,fqestdf,t3_gii4z1,1589313012.0,"Sending love and good thoughts your way <3. This horrible quarantine will end and things will return to normal soon enough, hang in there"
BPD,fqerk1r,t3_giiiuv,1589312418.0,"Hey friend, I’m struggling the same during this very difficult time. The key is to catch yourself when you begin spiraling and feeling lousy, and change *something*. Whether it be changing rooms, going outside for a walk, stretching, take a shower/bath, reading that book you’ve been putting off, Making a DIY project or planning a gift/surprise for a loved one, you gotta keep your mind occupied the best you can. I know than can seem impossible when you have no motivation, but baby steps, and reward yourself! 

Other things I do that seem to help me when I start feeling bad: online shopping/browsing, look up journal prompts, watch stand up comedy, watch family guy, make string friendship bracelets, play with my doggos, I reply with advice to people online that need it and call loved ones! That last one is very important, stay in contact with the people you love as much as possible. 

Remember that quarantine will NOT last forever.  Things will return to normal. In the meantime, keep your mind occupied, practice self love and self care and hang in there dude, I believe in u <3"

Talk to your teachers and tell them what’s going on, they can probably help you in some way!

Clean your room/workspace and make it your school related place, not your bed if you can too. This is important man, if you slip now it will be so fucking hard to catch up and succeed in high school.

After is (like I said) just peeing, often changing the sheets if theyre you know *wet*. I get dressed and then clean off the sex toys with soap spray. That’s about all the logistics of prep and cleanup for me haha"

iih,fp6lh6c,t3_gbm8qc,1588354378.0,"I went through it all. CT, MRI,MRV and lumbar puncture. It went fast and was mostly painless, I just worried I had cancer or something (I didn’t). After the LP they finally (about 2momths after originals going to the eye doctor for a checkup where they found optic nerve swelling) diagnosed me w IIH. They put me on Diamox. Nothing else was wrong and all the scans came back clean. Diamox is currently lowering the optic nerve pressure and all is well on that front. 

Try to keep yourself sane and not too scared (IK it’s hard not to) but the likelihood that it’s cancer or something very serious was very very low in my case and probably is for yourself too. Hang in there pal, it gets easier."
