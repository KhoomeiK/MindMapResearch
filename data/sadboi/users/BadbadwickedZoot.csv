skin,fqnslno,t3_gjrrai,1589500624.0,"I'm not sure if this helps, but I paint silicone skin for a living and a good tip is to press your skin with your finger for a few seconds and let go. The colour you see is usually the colour you pigment the silicone as your skin base. Thats how you can tell what pigment is best to cast as the base before painting veins, blushing etc. You should get an idea of your base colour. 
I actually inquired here a few weeks ago about my base colour , but I never thought of applying this technique to make up. Not gonna lie, I kinda feel like an idiot for realising this sooner. Then again I am usually painting a client or subject that I've never met, and it never a technique i thought about using myself.
Sorry for rambling."
