So instead of:

We actually have to do:
> SELECT vbeln FROM vbak.

That's because Sales Document : Header Data = Verkaufsbeleg : Kopfdaten.

ProgrammerHumor,fordz3j,t1_forbhy1,1588010605.0,"In SQL when you use the command BEGIN you can change the contend of tables but the changes are not definitive, so if you do:  
 BEGIN>anycode > ROLLBACK   


The database automatically undo anything you have done. Think on ROLLBACK like a Ctlr + Z. You can do (almost) any shit, like delete everything , fill every table table with your name and then use this ""Ctrl+Z"" to undo everything. It is a safeguard so you don't change information you should not.

  
The opposite of rollback is COMMIT.

So if you do:  
BEGIN>anycode>COMMIT.  


The database will assume that any changes are definitive. Think on COMMIT like the SAVE button from a word or excel document.  


The problem is that most databases use the ""COMMIT"" behavior as default. 

That means that:  
""BEGIN>anycode>COMMIT"" is the same thing than just ""anycode"".

What happened on my work is that I was testing something on production, so the data there was for real, i was using the recommend practice of always using BEGIN and ROLLBACK, so my changes would always be undone. When my boss came to ask I got lazy and I executed the code without the safeguard(BEGIN/ROLLBACK), which means my code was instantly SAVED ( COMMIT). You CAN'T rollback if you did not used the command BEGIN before.  


So I was screwed, i had to calculate what was changed and revert it back to original because I did not used the safeguard BEGIN/ROLLBACK.

And we are LUCKY that the price is ""localized"" because $20 is actually R$111. If the price was not localized the average guy on my country would need to work  24 hours to buy rimworld.

The first 2 battles are easy enough with non limited breaked 3*"
SAOAlicizationRS,fbycqme,t3_ef4hm2,1577213628.0,"I am not sure but the reset on my timezone is about 3-4 AM.

Right now is 4PM here. So if you do a new account before the reset I think you can still get it ( assuming the event actually ends at 31)

If the event is really ending on the reset of day 30 you are late regardless of timezone."

On a 11 pull you have \~29% of change of getting one 4\*. And if my math is correct you have \~9% of chance of chance of getting 2 4\*. The odds to get 3 4\* on a multi-summon is close to 2%. It is going to happen with some of us."

ProgrammerHumor,fbgarpb,t1_fbg3lf5,1576842870.0,"You see that's exactly the issue.

 I am an ABAP/JavaScript programmer. As far I am aware there is not a specific line where you are junior or mid or senior.

That's why I said ""based on my contract"". I started as a intern, got promoted to junior, later to mid and recently to senior. I was promoted based on the feedback of my technical leader or by the interviewer avaliation.I change companies twice in this process.

The difference between a senior and a junior is general expertise, how good they are at solving problems, how fast they can debug/solve issues. In my current company you also cannot be senior if you don't have some leadership skills."
