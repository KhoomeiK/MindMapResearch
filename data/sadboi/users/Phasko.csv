You wouldn't tell a lot of people what you were doing and it was definitely off-putting. People hanging your bike in a tree, throwing all sorts stuff at you, dumping the contents of your bag, dragging you to the wrong class and general bullying was pretty normal.

rpg,fr4bhts,t3_glsnp3,1589882699.0,"The only rpg I've played in person was a complete homebrew sci-fi prototype made for worldbuilding. The characters they made had absolutely no limitations, resulting in very weird characters (very low intelligence that couldn't read etc.)

When the characters started they had nothing so the GM left them items to find (crafting was a large part of the setting) but instead of using the sticks, string, Flint and feathers to make a bow, they decided to make flint knuckles, nunchucks, put the feathers in their hair, and finally use a metal rod as a pushing stick for their homemade sled that they'd use to slide down a hill and ram into enemies.

Ultimately it was the people who made the rpg fun, and these were people that fucked around alot. Doing this rpg with a couple of beers after a game of secret Hitler was definitely a good choice for the group. Some groups murder-hobo, some groups are all rules lawyers and some groups will be plain boring. It's all depends on the group you're with.

I've used virtually every antidepressant out there, anti-anxiety medication and even mild antipsychotics because I have had nightmares for two years straight without a break. I've lost my job, and also my passion. Between the panic attacks, mental breakdowns and the occasional extremely bad response to medication (conversion disorders) I found it pretty difficult to eat, sleep and the like.

That being said, to me advice like ""think positively"" or ""just go on a holiday"" feels a bit insulting because in that time that I've been dealing with this, I've definitely tried it every single day. Going outside, talking to people, writing about what you think went well/better than expected, exercise, planning your day, not sleeping during the day, opening your curtains, showering, eating well (and regularly) are all things that I fight for every day. 

I do believe it's very important to do all of these things, but having people that don't know anything about depression besides knowing that ""they're all downers"" tell you to think positively every single time you talk to them is very frustrating. Doesn't mean I disagree with them.

To compare it to something else; if every time a fat person talk to someone, they'd give you the advice to just eat less and exercise more, they wouldn't be wrong, but it's also something they'd already know, and isn't the entire solution to the problem.

fo76,fpow7kf,t1_fpoi5k8,1588791716.0,"I understand exactly what you mean. Before this all started I was also pretty frustrated that it was difficult to have some sort of interaction with people. After all, in shooters I've had some good experiences (and bad, but let's not focus on that) with a lot of players using mics.

I've hoped that in these cases (people not wanting to communicate) there'd be a single player option for the game (that isn't tied to a subscription) but alas. We're stuck with this for now.

In the case that I'm not talking, I always try to emote and most of the time give people some prepared food/drink for their efforts, but that's not what they're looking for, and u understand that. They're looking for an experience with other players, but people are way too spread out, and don't interact often enough. That's why I think there should either be a single player option, a way to select servers (perhaps some oriented towards social interaction with a mic requirement or something) or a better way to communicate for those not using speech at all.

The argument I'm making is that the game, combined with how servers work (and their numbers) doesn't work because there's a lot of people who are not talking and it's frustrating for a lot of people. 

If the player pool per server was larger, there were better non-verbal ways of talking (perhaps quick commands with audio lines bring played like other cooperation based games) or people would talk more (which is difficult to do, because this means changing behavior of a lot of players) the game would be so much better of a social experience. 

I don't even run into people that often. And when I do, we're going opposite directions or there's a 100 level difference between us. Even though you can definitely work together when there's such a big difference, it's not inviting. Doesn't matter how hard they want to carry you, because sometimes you're not looking to power level.

But yes I definitely get your point. This was also what I was scared of when they said the game would be always online. I know they can't easily up the server capacity, but it'd surely help."

I lost my job and isolated myself to such an extent that I've stopped talking to almost everyone.

Things are a bit better now but certainly not good enough to call/talk to people I don't know. My stomach turns, I start sweating and I close up entirely. Doesn't mean I'm not trying. I'm putting myself in the situation to expose me to more social people and eventually talk to people.

The armpits seem a bit more accurate (my anecdotal evidence suggests) but the ears are a bit easier to reach. Also the ears get really cold so I can see if it's too cold during winter."
dogs,fpaegj3,t3_gc91cc,1588446471.0,"A relaxed pace and stops along the way make it great for a dog. If my dog is running for 5, she's practically dead. A little lie down or a gentle stroll where she can sniff every blade of grass and she'll start zooming again.

I think it's important to look for signs of exhaustion and being too hot. I always feel the armpits and ears, and check if she wants any water. If she's tired, she has some indicators that she wants to rest, which I'm guessing you can see in your dog as well. It's difficult because every dog is different, but if you're careful then you can always experiment with how long/how intense."

thenetherlands,fp96tvh,t1_fp968fv,1588416576.0,"Vaak worden alle harde kazen met dezelfde vorm parmezaanse kaas genoemd in de VS, het beste wat ik je aan kan raden is om dan grana padano te nemen, het lijkt er het meeste op. Naast de parmezaan en de grana padano liggen vaak andere harde kazen met dezelfde vorm, vaak is dat wel redelijk te gebruiken als vervanging. Vaak is er veel prijsverschil per merk, dus ik zou dan gewoon eerst de goedkoopste uitproberen. Wel moet je vaak dan extra zout toevoegen omdat er vaak niet (veel) zoutkristallen in de goedkopere kazen zitten.

Geraspte kaas is het vaak niet waard voor mij (prijs-gewicht verhouding is belachelijk) maar er zijn van al die andere kazen soms ook geraspte of gesnipperde versies. Wat de Amerikanen doen met andere kazen ook is dat ze een Amerikaanse vervalsing kopen. Zo hebben ze dan ook hele vreemde ""cheddar"". Ik heb zelf ook nog niet precies hetzelfde kunnen vinden, maar ik denk niet dat ze gewone geraspte kaas zullen gebruiken."

Oils are (most of the time) not even 100% (or 80, even) the oil that's being named on the packaging. Most of those oils come from the same factory, just a different bottle/label.

Milk is being mixed and stored in giant containers, to be put in various different cartons. Sometimes the price difference is more than 100%.

Honey is the same as milk, except for the ""organic"" label which is a whole other can of worms. Basically organic doesn't mean the same in every country, so foreign honey can be sold as organic without question."
