And I forgot to add that with the questions, I may throw out a spiel I used to use in the earlier years or if someone isn’t as familiar with HSV and throw out some typical facts—such as how HSV manifests over time, transmission rates, antivirals, or the percentage of the population that does actually have HSV (where most don’t know and don’t have symptoms but can be carriers).

If I feel like we may become intimate fairly quickly and we seem to really mesh well, I may say something before the first date via text message—especially if there’s been any kind of flirting with sexual undertones. Typically after I disclose, I’ll let them know to ask me anything if they have any questions for me. Sometimes I’ll prefer having the conversation in person, especially if we mesh well after having had a first or second date.

AmItheAsshole,fnb4mps,t3_g0gzko,1586809131.0,"NTA. I could barely make it past your title.

Take this from someone (25F) who ended up being a full-time caretaker for their (at the time) 77 year old grandmother for exactly 1 year. She ended up passing away 2.5 days after I finally managed to move out. I had no idea here state of health until I was there 24/7. 

A lot of bitterness and resentment built up during this time and that sullied a lot of the memories I have of my grandmother. Our relationship suffered greatly and I didn’t even get to have the opportunity to rebuild it before she suddenly passed (she had COPD, and in turn, congestive heart failure, she we knew it was coming... just didn’t know it would be so soon). She was also incredibly stubborn and head strong, which didn’t help. Even the day before she passed, she never admitted to anything being wrong or off. She would not allow anyone to come in to help while also lying to me, her family, and herself by saying I was not her caretaker (I was). 

This would be your choice and your choice alone. Don’t let your family manipulate you or make you feel bad. This is a HUGE responsibility and something you should not go into lightly."

I had a guy 10 years older than me try to ask and I shut it down so quick. It’s almost like they throw a little tantrum because you won’t let them potentially disrespect you.

I saw a quote today that stated that “sometimes love isn’t enough.” You seem to be leaning far more toward being child free than being onboard with having children—you also have very valid reasons for not wanting children, let alone not wanting and regretting adopting a puppy.

I would hate to see you compromise your happiness by having children that you seem to not want, all in the name of love. Please think all of this through thoroughly before you go through with marriage. I would hate to see you harbor resentment towards your significant other for living a life that you didn’t wholeheartedly “sign up” for. You can love someone deeply but still not be compatible.

EstrangedAdultChild,fmw6nvn,t3_fxhxo8,1586440690.0,"No, you’re not wrong in feeling hurt. I think you need to enforce some boundaries though and step into your truth. Easier said than done, but why should you care about what anyone else thinks or about whatever gossip is spreading if it isn’t the truth? And as far as sharing personal medical information goes, that should’ve been squashed yesterday. Don’t let people disrespect you, OP. Stand up for yourself, please. Why does your mother in law think it’s appropriate to go over your head and meet with you estranged “parents”? Why is your spouse so passive about his mother’s behavior as it relates to you and the toxic relationship you’ve had with your “parents?”

None of this sounds very healthy to me, OP. And this is not coming from a place of judgement, at all. I think you need to confront your MIL and put boundaries in place to let her know point-blank that what she is doing and has done in regards to reaching out to your parents is unacceptable and that she does not have your permission to do so. 

Your spouse needs to grow a backbone and stand up for you, to his mother. He also needs to express how inappropriate it is that she is in contact with your parents. That kind of comes with the territory when you decide to marry someone, you stand up for and alongside your spouse against the world—you’re a team.

I also would suggest some sort of individual counseling, if you haven’t already tried that, OP. It sounds like you’re just accepting all of this and not really standing up for yourself. You don’t need people to believe in you to know that you’re in the right and being truthful. You need to believe yourself and either ignore or address/squash the petty gossip, and be more confident in yourself and what is your truth. I would honestly even go so far as to say that a start in doing that is telling yourself that because you care so much about yourself and your mental health, YOU made the decision to go little-to-no contact with your toxic parents, NOT the other way around. You deserve(d) better than to be treated that way, “family” or not.

Best of luck, OP."

Imagine if I hadn’t taken the last several years to heal from some health issues and build up my non-existent self esteem and confidence and someone had told me that? I also was always very small and probably underweight for my height—I actually am healthier and happier being “bigger” and loving the skin I’m in.

Not being able to work due to slow time of year and workplace prejudice regarding corona virus. Not having been offered a new job yet despite putting in literally 100+ apps over the last 4-6 weeks with 8 years of work experience. Depression and anxiety at a high. Grief pretty bad. Loneliness and heartbreak. Hopelessness. Oh, and I got very sick (not corona) the next day after the guy decided to ghost me and have been suffering from a persistent cough the last 3 weeks. Dating apps are shitty and the people on them are horrible and toxic (I chose to delete them all permanently again and pray I don’t download them again). Genuinely thought things were going great and “looking up.”

The list goes on and some of these things were present last month as well. I thought I’d be alright during this retrograde, but it was absolutely terrible and I honestly am having a hard time being hopeful for things to be better again."

Why are you already considering doing something you absolutely don’t want to do and have very rational, logical reasons for not doing so for someone with the exact opposite view as you? You can’t compromise with children. You’re so young and I think you could find someone else who is more compatible and is understanding—rather than dismissive—of your concerns. Anxiety or not, your intuition and your gut is in the mix as well.  It’s telling you that this is your dealbreaker, it’s getting to the point of being unavoidable, and causing you serious stress. You could wait 10 years to see if you’ll change your mind—but why put yourself through that? What if neither of you change your minds? 

I’m a fence sitter who is leaning heavily toward being child free. I also deal with anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Doesn’t mean that I’m irrational about every thing or decision in the world. Trust yourself and your intuition and let that guide you. If you’re troubled by that, investigate why. I wish you all the best and hope you make the best decision for YOU, not anyone else."
