And I feel like I love him so I feel like it will be hard to let him go when he gets out but I feel used.

Oh & some “friends” were like “They took care of you all these years just pay for his surgery” or whatever & like ummm.... me & him don’t even speak"

This is one reason I didn’t want APS bothering me while the payee stuff is being investigated. I definitely will with the CPS, do you know if there would still be reports of that? Most of those were in 2004. Just to make sure - this new one says MY NAME & then has the bone surgery listed etc. I found out online that AS LONG AS IM LIVING @ HOME my mom does not have to report anything she bought for me w/ my money. So here I just found bone surgery & the doctor visit but I have no idea why they would issue it to my name? Like how does that work, “Can you send the bill to my daughter”?"

I ended up being admitted YEARS later for suicide attempt/ideations, but that's why. I admitted myself 1x. & I was stuck & hiding in my room & traumatized & afraid. But I just clicked on your link & that was so so helpful omg. Thank you so much - I'm sorry but I felt you were turning against me. But I'm serious ... Call the main number. They ask what they can help you with - I said need representative - they told me one can't talk to me until end of Aug or Sept and hung up. I called again and clicked on whatever number it was for rep payee stuff, & all it did was explain things to me. I could ONLY get a robot. So it sucks it's so hard for me to get there but yeah the BS is from the govt then 🤣 But I'm gonna call a local one AGAIN tomorrow. Hopefully they don't say AGAIN that I have to call the main state customer service and be hung up on by a robot AGAIN. 😭 😡 Idk if God is real, but it seems like he keeps blocking me from doing this.

Not to mention the 2 private sexual assaults that he apologized for claiming he thought I was my mom and was disoriented. I have to see him EVERY DAY in the kitchen and main level. Thanks for making me think about that again. You wanna call BS on someone? Call BS on them.

I'm not allowed out of my house without telling her where I'm going INCLUDING the person I'm going with's phone number.

Again you are bullying and wrongfully accusing the victim who was subjected to Munchausen and a Symbiotic relationship which I have desperately been trying to break free from. I said MULTIPLE times that SSI has not been answering people until around September and that MY MOM is the one who told me that I do not have a case worker. I obviously have Stockholm syndrome I am not the one who is or was lying. I also have disabilities so if I was given wrong information - especially by my own mom - it makes sense that I would believe it. That doesn't mean I'm lying. I'm sorry that you both have such a hard time understanding victims of abuse. But you should NOT be shaming me for things that aren't in my control. You're just here trolling. At least block me if you hate seeing my posts so much.

Regarding my important documents - I don't have any of those lol - SHE has all of them. I actually have a brand new job I'm starting today which I've been binge eating all night about because I'm so not ready to do this kind of work physically (or mentally) right now but I ran off & applied because of pressure from my mom. So I called the bank about starting a new account and i have to put in a $25 deposit and then make sure to buy 10 things a month or I'll be charged - but as I'm disabled & need a rep payee I realized I'm not sure if I'm even allowed to do that myself. I wish I was like you and got all the help that everyone was providing me at age 17, but I guess I just suck. You're very brave. And also she made a COPY of my birth certificate for my new job, she won't allow me to have my own because I'm ""gonna lose it."" Lastly, shes 66 so in a couple decades I should definitely be alone - if I'm alive - because I have bad bone disease. The other day I said I really need a bone density test and she said ""for what? it's not gonna do anything"" when she JUST had hers. I haven't had one in like five years. But I do not feel young. I feel very old & miserable right now. People on here hating on me got me kind of upset...& please PM me whenever you feel like. I could definitely use a pep talk right now lol. I'm glad you wrote me at this time. I wish there was an explanation as to why these horrible people exist. But how can I call her horrible when she's helping pay for my dog & my phone etc? I'M obviously horrible right? She's abusing me, but I'm the horrible one according to ""everyone"". All I do is give her respect these days & she just shits on me. It's horrible & I'm scared. But people said don't be scared because I didn't do anything wrong. But she has lied to police before saying I was physically abusive & emotionally abusive, one time I pushed her out of the way when I was running away from my father who tried to kill me by strangling me, & she got a little bruise on her back, & the police said she could have me locked up if she wanted but she didn't. I did NOT physically abuse her, she was standing in the way because she loved to watch my father abuse me. She was always in the room laughing and smiling. Ugh sorry I just feel broken. Thank you"

I really hate these police and i HAVE to go to THEM! to me some of these police should be in jail - they left me all alone to be abused physically and emotionally and sexually as an adolescent, and theyre still mistreating me now"
entitledparents,ex0upjh,t1_ex0gclo,1565922674.0,"Thank you so much. I think I have no authority to ask for payment history but I'll try! I got the claims on my debit card but I don't care about those as much. I wish I knew how to send the statements to the govt, my mom should have taught me but she wont."
raisedbynarcissists,ex0uia4,t1_ex0gwe5,1565922534.0,Thank you. That's all I really wanted 💖🙏🏻
entitledparents,ex0bjtg,t1_ex0azkr,1565909014.0,I really don't have a trusted caregiver & everyone does say that =[ But I get so little I don't see why she would use it on her own stuff cause she still works a little & her job gives good money ? So I'm alive because she's also helping take care of me when I have no job/little job w/ the money?
entitledparents,ex0b7xa,t1_ewwd163,1565908800.0,😭😭😭
entitledparents,ex0ax6a,t1_ex07l0f,1565908616.0,"Well you can feel however you want about it, but it's my life & I think I would know. So yeah. And that's a concern. She always said that I'd be f*cked without her so I have no idea how these care agencies or ARPA works."
raisedbynarcissists,ex0aprf,t1_ex09w7i,1565908494.0,Thank you so much. I'm scared but ok everyone keeps saying it 🙏🏻
raisedbynarcissists,ex056f0,t1_ex04186,1565905270.0,"Thank you so so much. I've been getting bullied on here & accused of lying & stuff so I really appreciate your support. Wait though, so you understand about the rep payee stuff, I thought that's why I'm not allowed authorization because she's the one who has to do it for me? & for YEARS she said she has to tell them every month, then when I called them & found out how much I was actually getting she changed it to she has to tell them once a year. So I'm confused AF. And I just confronted her about my PIN number and she was like IDK what you're talking about, call them again & request another one. & I said check the mail better & she insisted it wasn't in the mail. I got it on voice memo, and I have the pictures of the opened mail/pin # ... No idea the point of that lie except someone said maybe cause she already opened it & knows that was illegal?"
entitledparents,ex04w6g,t1_ex03s1g,1565905117.0,yes thats why I wasn't using it. thank you. it looks scary and i hear rly bad stories so def need to be really careful or maybe theres a new app
raisedbynarcissists,ex01fxz,t1_ewzzwpn,1565903581.0,Yes the only thing is I have to do a $25 deposit it and then purchase 10 things a month to afford the $10 monthly charge and it’s $10 an hour or less for my new 8 hour job so it may take a while ? She’s already trying to gauge me with my own money like usual before even starting
raisedbynarcissists,ex01915,t1_ewzyk0o,1565903506.0,"Thank you!! I called them today & told them & they just said I have no authority over my card, not even to be told about recent charges if I have questions etc. But regarding mom, couldn’t she have just said she got it and give it to me because I wouldn’t have given her shit but maybe she thinks I would recognize it’s illegal"
raisedbynarcissists,ex00td5,t1_ex005ip,1565903345.0,omg!! yes they said they can’t tell me ANYTHING
entitledparents,ewzxzsc,t1_ewzsdlu,1565902290.0,So the only new payee I can get is an agency or the state. If I switch over to that she says that I’ll be way worse off because of the allowance she gives me from it. She’ll also kick me out. What do you think of agencies?
entitledparents,ewzxs5q,t1_ewztdue,1565902209.0,"Ok so I just talked to her and she said she had no idea what I was talking about, that I didn’t receive it in the mail & to call them again & request another one...then called me horrible for not believing her. I have pix, it was made out to my name & I even logged in with it. She has authorized use of my card though, she’s my rep payee for me SSI. I don’t know why she’s lying about this"
entitledparents,ewztjmr,t1_ewz1wa8,1565900564.0,Thank you. It sucks I have nowhere to go. I want to block her on everything SO bad but unfortunately I'm stuck here. Thank you for the subreddit I joined it. In the UK this type of abuse actually is illegal and I could have had her in jail a decade or more ago =/
entitledparents,ewzt93l,t1_ewwcurw,1565900448.0,Thank you and no I don't =\[ most of my friends still live at home or still have roommates or are dudes who don't want to room with me lol. I just got a small job I'm starting tomorrow. It'll only be 8 hours a wee and $10 or less an hour but it's something!! I'll look on craigslist maybe?
entitledparents,ewzt5es,t1_ewwj6vk,1565900403.0,"I'm scared. They don't take me seriously because they think I'm nuts from all the lies my parents have said and just the fact that I have mental illness and may say there's no proof, except I took pictures of it on her desk. She may say it's because she's my payee and I have no authority but I believe she still has to show me my own mail and the fact she hid my pin number from me was horrible, and I found out she's been charging some things on my card that she's been lying to me about but something small like bagels. But she uses that to hold it over my head like ""I bought you bagels and you didn't eat one I'm sick of throwing them out when I buy them for you. I'm only buying them if you're gonna eat them."" (I have a very bad eating disorder I'm recovering from) then I saw she was charging ME for the bagels! But she's my MOM & I feel horrible to report her to the police =/"
entitledparents,ewzsnur,t1_ewz7fhg,1565900201.0,"I have her stored on my phone as ""Egg doner"" lol. And thank you so much, it's exhausting but I'll do it. The police said they'll start writing down reports from now on but I feel like they don't take me seriously. Like I went in to them last month to report abuse and they wrote down what I said completely inaccurately and made me look retarded. UGHHH But yes I'll do that!! I also take a lot of screenshots"
entitledparents,ewzsghr,t1_ewwabgv,1565900110.0,"I think my replies to you were removed, I tried calling SSI today and they sent me to some crisis hotline and they had no idea and didn't think there was such a thing as a case worker on my payments so I'm gonna try calling the state again next week since I start my new small job tomorrow. I'm worried that reporting her again or saying anything is going to cause worse issues at home again and I'm seriously stuck. I have no friends that I can stay with, no relatives I speak to, the shelters are all booked and section 8 housing isn't accepting applications anymore. That's why I vent on Reddit a lot, but unfortunately I've been getting bullied on here now too with people saying I'm lying or not doing anything to help myself and loads of bullshit. I'm on medicare and I'm in NY. What's a payment stub?"
entitledparents,ewzs51f,t1_ewwcg74,1565899954.0,They're horrible. Literally one star & a half on Google. The last time I reported her they came here unannounced and spoke to her first and believed all her lies (at the time my dad too) and I called them recently and they said they were going to do the same thing & come unannounced so I don't want that to happen again. After that the abuse escalated...pretty bad =/
entitledparents,ewzrvl4,t1_ewzpwuf,1565899838.0,Omg give myself a bruise noooo I'm not lying
entitledparents,ewzrsu5,t1_ewx3o1w,1565899805.0,Thank you for understanding and LOL OMG
entitledparents,ewzrrd8,t1_ewx9tbu,1565899787.0,Too bad all my relatives are on my mom's side and I had to block them all. She lies to them about me and EVERYTHING. =\[. Thank you for your suggestion though!!!
