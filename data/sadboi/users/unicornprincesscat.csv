mentalhealth,f42yi24,t3_dizy4a,1571336777.0,"You can have bipolar 2 which is more common and less extreme.  This is what I am diagnosed as currently.  Living with this disorder is hard.  It feels like you are a child, you can't emotionally regulate yourself, just like a child you can't handle things and you feel very intense emotions.  An example is a car cutting you off... most people would give a beep of their horn and move on with their lives, when you are bipolar it feels like this random person is ruining your day and you get caught up in the emotion and freak out, maybe engaging in road rage. 

When you go threw a depressive state you feel extreme sadness, you kinda shut down and you feel like dying, you most likely have suicidal thoughts and a will to die because unlike normal people feeling depressed, you feel it like someone ripped your heart out.  These depressive episodes can last for weeks to months (in my experience)

On the other hand you also have a ""high"" but you are hypomanic meaning a less extreme happiness/ elevated mood.  You might start a bunch of projects, sleep less, engage in risky behavior, have an increase in energy, unusual behaviors and actions, and a markedly distinctive increase in talkativeness and confidence, commonly exhibited with a flight of creative ideas. Other symptoms related to this may include feelings of [grandiosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandiosity), [distractibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distractibility), and [hypersexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersexuality).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania#cite_note-1) While hypomanic behavior often generates productivity and excitement, it can become troublesome if the subject engages in risky or otherwise inadvisable behaviors, and/or the symptoms manifest themselves in trouble with everyday life events.on top of all this sometimes you aren't even sure if you are feeling better or having a hypomanic episode."
