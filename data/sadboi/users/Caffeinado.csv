   * I should note that I did see a derm recently - who took my fatty alcohol breakout as significant acne and immediately prescribed me an antibiotic, Dapzone, Adapalene, and Spiro. I haven't started on any of these products because he told me to start on all 4 of them immediately and that scares the shit out of me. Plus, my skin has improved since stopping fatty alcohol stuff, so...

Trying a new moisturizer after patch testing and I noticed a couple of new pimples in my usual trouble spots that I usually have under control with my routine. Is that one day enough to say ""nope this isn't working for me""?"

relationships,evcbje0,t3_cj8tt7,1564411348.0,"This will only make you miserable. I got to the point with my ex-partner where I was making lunches only for myself and taking them to work, otherwise he would always eat food out of the fridge but never cook. Any attempts to get him to clean more often resulted in fights because his logic was if it didn't bother him, it shouldn't bother me. 

It clearly brought up his inability to compromise early in the relationship and made me realize that I was compromising my habits, ethics, and behavior to suit him. I left him after 4.5 years. I now have a partner that helps me without my having to ask (and he doesn't even live with me). You don't have to be a maid to this man."
politics,escdkj3,t1_esbu5sj,1561827034.0,Thank you for giving me an actionable thing to do. I spend every day oscillating between hope and existential dread and my existing effort into reducing my own carbon footprint doesn't seem like enough. I signed up to lobby - I never had before because I just had no idea! Thank you.

Global warming and it being ignored by our government, our same government imprisoning children in inhumane conditions, abortion rights being threatened yet again. It seems like everything is getting worse every time I turn on the news. I've been struggling with the feeling that the things I do day to day don't make a difference to any of these problems."

intermittentfasting,epmrfem,t3_bubzwb,1559316595.0,"I've been trying to get to 16:8. I get super hangry so I'm slowly working up to it, about at a 14.5 hour fast now. Sometimes in the morning, I'll get to a point where I'll feel lightheaded and spacey (I say the wrong words, get spacey) but it's like once I'm past that point, it doesn't matter what I eat, I'm like that for the rest of the day. It's really annoying and makes it hard to continue my fast. Any tips about what this could be?"
intermittentfasting,ep62fda,t3_bu15wc,1559063800.0,"**Type**: Working up to 16:8 Eating Schedule

**Context**: Been working up to this for a few weeks

**Length**: 14.5 hours, 10:30 - 8:00 right now

**Why**: I'd like to be able to eat more in my eating window, reduce bloating, increase mental clarity

**Notes**: I am a hangry monster when I don't eat, so I have been working up to a 16:8 schedule very slowly. Right now I can comfortably stop eating at 8 and eat my first meal at 10:30 the next day (14.5 hours). I attempted to increase the size of my window from 11:00 - 8:00, eating slightly later, and  I noticed that my head felt funny (lightheaded, dizzy) and that feeling didn't go away even after eating. Will this continue happening? This tanks my productivity since I feel out of it for the rest of the day."
