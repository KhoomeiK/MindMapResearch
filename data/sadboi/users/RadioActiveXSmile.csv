Amazon shoppers are really good at doing this in the back room when I'm 14 feet in the air managing my back stock. Not. A. Word. Cheese dicks."

We have to make space for new and trending products. It's especially funny when the brand actually stopped producing the product and the guest still wants to wag their finger at Bezos.
You're welcome to express your disappointment in the partnership of AMZ and WFM, but it won't make the product appear on the shelf or reauthorize it for ordering.

""The website says you sell it!"" Most of these brands have product locators that I demonstrate for the guest to show them it's only available in California. I'm on the East coast."

Dealing with conflict among TMs

Prioritizing/Chain of Command: TL tells you to do one thing, ASTL tells you to do the opposite thing, and other ASTL tells you to do a whole other thing. How do you deal with the situation?   
Similar: TL does something that makes no sense without you knowing while you're off. You come back while your TL is off and store leadership hates it and questions what was done. Throw TL under bus? Backup TL's decisions on the fly? 

Managing vs Coaching vs Leading. Do some thinking/reading about those things to get you in the mindset.

Also remember why you're doing this and what you want in this position.

When they ask how soon you want to move up to a TL role they're looking for ""One year."""

I’ve convinced myself it’s mostly in my head and slight changes throughout the day are normal anyway.
