Ive gotten down from 120mg to 30mg and have not noticed any detrimental effects except for the 1st few days of each taper. Ill give it a few more weeks and then start taking .50 mg of Klonopin x2 a day. My biggest issue besides depression is anxiety.

benzorecovery,fo6vkvw,t1_fo6u57i,1587567543.0,Cymbalta (duloxetine) is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressant (SSNRI). Duloxetine affects chemicals in the brain that may be unbalanced in people with depression.

200 mg; and Cymbalta- which I have been able to cut that from 120mg down to 30mg. The thing is people need to realize that these meds are not a cure but a way to cope with your symptoms and allow you time to search for the root cause behind everything that is putting you through hell. My collection of doctors have been able to diagnosis me with things like low T, IGg deficiency, Adult ADHD, depression, extremely low vitamin D and Iron levels, RLS, Chronic Sinusitis among some other minor problems. Working on all of these things has allowed me to start cutting my doses down and getting better little by little."
benzorecovery,fo6rneo,t3_g5iec4,1587565402.0,I’ve been on the same thing for about 3 years when I started having panic attacks just about daily. They have improved significantly and during the last year I’ve cut back from 2 MG to 1 MG I couldn’t even tell a difference. I also take Cymbalta 30 MG a day and I’m thinking that the Cymbalta is preventing me from feeling the affect of cutting my  dose down. Now when I run out of the Cymbalta for a few days; I get pretty nasty side effects from not taking that. On a positive note I was taking 120 mg Cymbalta per day and have tapered down 30 mg per day successfully.

He has an unlimited hall pass at this point from what I understand. He can do whatever he needs or wants. Also being married and learning from past experiences/regrets, he has probably picked up a few pointers over the years.
