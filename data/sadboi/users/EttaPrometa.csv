It does take patience (would not recommend serious pounding the first round!), but with time...size doesn't matter as much as position. Scar tissue (way at the top) at top can still be a bitch sometimes tho..."
Divorce,fj6l0xt,t3_fbuchf,1583074602.0,"Best suggestion is to work through your thoughts/feeling with a therapist if you feel comfortable doing so. The perspective of an outside view (imho) was instrumental for me personally. 

If staying together is a viable option, both parties have to be willing to work through the hurt/anger/resentment etc - no matter how long it takes.  It will get ugly/hard before it ever gets better or starts to heal.  Is there a chance for that in your situation? 

There was a tipping point (after 8 months of intensive weekly therapy) where I realized I could not work on our marriage AND deal with my own childhood trauma (surfaced after 30 years) and a CPTSD diagnosis. So I chose 'me' and left.  It has taken a year (still fighting in court for paperwork), but I do not regret my decision. I still love him (and always will to some degree), but this Divorce is something I have to get passed.   

Only now, with hindsight, do I realize that it's not about the length of time together,  but about the quality of that time.  We were not healthy together.  I can't say the same for him, but despite all the frustration of Divorce proceedings,  I am in a deeper place of peace now than I have been in 15 years. 

Apologies for the long response, but there is no right or wrong answer to your question.  Everyone of us here wonders/ed the same at some point.   It is important though, that you make the decision (no matter which way) that is best for YOU.  

Best of luck, and hugs from me to you."

My only suggestion? Perhaps have the watch taken off at the beginning of your time together? If he is worried about not getting back to mom immediately? Tell him if it is truly an emergency,  mom will reach out to you. Frame it as a time away from technology/screen time. That way he focuses on you/the quality time you guys have with each other. 

It's awful for you to be in this position (perceived bad guy), but just know...this isn't about your child, it's about your Ex's need to control &/or sabotage your time together.
