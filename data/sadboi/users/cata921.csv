I feel like I was in a similar boat as OP yesterday. It was my bf's birthday and I decided to make one of his favorite Cuban dishes, ropa vieja.

We were sitting on a bench on an empty baseball field, passing a blunt, when my friend says, ""Guys, run!"" Now if someone says run, I'm gonna run! So I glance to my left and see the edge of the field that borders a forest and standing there is a man wearing nothing but a pillow case/sheet/something white over his head. From there, we all ran so fast and didn't even look back. 

To this day, I sometimes question if we actually saw that and if we did, why? Why was he there? Did he have a fetish? The world may never know..."
