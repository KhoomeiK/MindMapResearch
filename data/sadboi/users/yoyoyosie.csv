The fact that he pushed you off shows aggression and that he has something in his life that HE needs to work on not you, I know it may be hard but if you have a stable place else to go for a while, that might be your best bet. Try to stay calm when he wakes up and don’t let him give you a sob story. Let him know you’ve cried all night and are still very upset.
