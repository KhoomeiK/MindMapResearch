AskReddit,fishdv6,t3_f9b9x6,1582684862.0,"Probably the only one and most recent.

It goes back to April 2019 related to one of Etika's (streamer) mental breakdowns. I had heard and watched a couple of Etika's videos before this happened, but since I was a psychology student at the time I got interested as to what was happening to him. He was undiagnosed at the time.

I checked his official reddit page, right when he got into the psychiatric hospital (this happened around the time the police went to his apartment). He was doing a Q&A and I told him that it was okay to believe he was a God, but to please get better and stay safe, something along those lines. He actually replied and thanked me. Now, this was around May 2nd. I received dozens of downvotes, since his fanbase was calling him a clown back then and to me too, I suppose. 

I joined one of the biggest Etika discord servers back then to try to talk some sense into people since they were making some weird conspiracies, but his mental health was bad and he just needed some words of positivity back then. People started hating me for it too, but I actually met there my soon to be boyfriend.

I stayed on the server either way, but didn't talk much. Now it's June 7th, I started dating the boyfriend, because of Etika. End of June, Etika kills himself, and everybody starts feeling bad for calling him a clown.
I'm still dating that boyfriend 8 months later. I live in Central America and he lives in the United States. We are meeting in June :)

It's a bittersweet butterfly effect, but I will always be grateful that Etika left me with something positive in my life that I so badly needed.

Rest in Peace. We miss you."

2. All job positions in psychology involve working with other people. It does helps me be more compassionate, understanding and have more insight than other psychologists. Others can be more scientific than humanistic, and therefore can be rigid or close-minded regarding how they approach other mentally ill people, especially if they don't fit your text-book criteria.

3. In any religion, no. I do believe in God though.

4. It is worth living. It has been extra hard, but it's kinda fun. Animal Crossing is coming soon, I like the marvel movies, I like spending time with my boyfriend.

Basically, you can't control other people or ""change"" them. You can't. Not in that moment anyway. But when you change your response/reaction to the situation, then they might snap out of that state and react to you... and then they change their attitude as well.

It's about being the better person in the room. If they are on fire (aggressive/rude/mean) and you want to react to that same intensity, you are adding fire to fire... There's no benefit in that. If you respond better, with better skills and maturity than the other, you will at least be satisfied that you are sticking to your values.
