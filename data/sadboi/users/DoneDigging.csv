Most businesses are shifting their emphasis to be more online. Sex toys are a huge online industry, especially through companies like Amazon and AdamandEve. I like your idea of focusing on the niche of BDSM, as most of the time it is better to be great at one specific thing rather than good at many things.

Here are a few important questions to ask yourself:

1. What interests you more? Designing new adult toys, or building a means by which people can purchase them?
2. Do you have more of an entrepreneurial, risk-taking disposition, or would you rather have a steady salary?
3. Are you wanting to get involved in the business due to personal interest, a recognition of a need for it or both?
4. Would you rather work consistent hours, or are you okay with the idea of working 60-70 hour weeks to get your business off the ground, often making very little to no money in the beginning?
5. What is your knowledge of the market for adult toys? Is there anything that the current industry is not doing well, or any particular type of toy that you think you would excel at designing or selling?
6. Have you considered working for a company to build up the skill sets before branching off into your own business?"

JordanPeterson,f5jgq8n,t1_f5jcv5i,1572228063.0,"Thank you for your time and the thoroughness of your rebuttals. Let's go one at a time through your points:

1) Please provide me a link to a post on this subreddit in which you were downvoted despite the fact that you provided excellent argumentation and good sources.

2) Can you prove to me that shutting down white supremacists from speaking and removing their capacity to talk in public makes them change their views? Can you prove to me that forcing white supremacist Underground  has a positive impact on the overall societal acceptance or rejection of extremism? Have you studied history...at all? 

Hitler was an extremist, but things only became worse when he was thrown in prison and he took on the victimhood complex. In my opinion there's nothing worse than an extremist who is both highly sensitive and highly aggressive. Hitler was both. A lot of social justice warriors by definition are highly sensitive, and in the case of Antifa they are both. 

If you watch the work of the Sacha Baron Cohen, we see that comedy is an excellent way to shine a light on reprehensible viewpoints. A lot of people in the movie Borat rightfully received public scorn for their terrible words and viewpoints. Why can't we give white supremacist the rope to hang their own neck by allowing them to say terrible things and receive the public consequence? There is no logically sound argument for white supremacy. By allowing people like Stefan Molyneux to say pseudo-scientific bullshit in a public forum and then be destroyed in debate, we are more likely to change views than we are by banning him on YouTube and forcing him underground. extremism thrives when it is forced underground, it cannot survive in the light of day.

We must not encourage the victimhood complex that a lot of white supremacists have. I don't know if you know anything about the historical roots of white supremacy. I have studied it extensively. I'm fascinated by both white supremacy and the rise of individuals like Frederick Douglass, who are the perfect antithesis to an ignorant white supremacist who says that black people cannot be intelligent and well-spoken. Literally a long dead black man who was a self educated slave that continues to prove to this day beyond the shadow of a doubt that the intellectual presuppositions of white supremacy are absolute bullshit.

3) I was banned a long time ago, probably six or seven months ago. I'll go digging and see if I can find it. If I'm able to located I will message the post directly to you and I will probably post it in this subreddit for people to review and comment on themselves. I think it would start an interesting conversation because it was about one of Jordan Peterson's most controversial statements. I think it had something to do with the idea of Islam, feminism and the idea of women being dominated by men. I approached the statement in a different way than most. If you would like to know more, PM me about it.

4) From personal experience I disagree. I was on the debate team at UCLA and I found that people on the right generally were happy to debate and argue. People on the left were willing to argue, but generally speaking they were more willing to shut down discussions when they deemed them ""problematic"".

Ironically I think the word problematic is a problematic word, because it is often used by the academic left to argue that certain topics should not be discussed. I graduated college in 2010, but apparently UCLA has gotten a lot worse when it comes to not allowing or pushing back against controversial (usually right-wing) speakers. Ask yourself these questions. 

Who controls the social sciences in academia? 

Who controls HR departments at major corporations? 

Is Silicon Valley primarily left-wing or right-wing leaning?

Was James D'Amore fired for holding right-wing or left-wing views at Google?

What is more important? Diversity of thought or diversity of demographics?

Why is it that comedians are refusing to perform on college campuses?

I can provide a whole host of examples of comedians being shut down or censored for talking about things that were not deemed politically correct. I have never come across a right-wing academic who argued that someone's Free Speech should be taken away because their opinions were too dangerous. 

Here's a great clip from the Joe Rogan podcast with a comedian who was kicked off a stage for un-PC comedy. He made a gay joke and a black joke that was actually quite Progressive. But the organizers got offended and they decided that the comedian should be shut down because their feelings were hurt and they misunderstood jokes. 

https://youtu.be/3n9CsdcLP4g

Here is him getting kicked off. The organizers didn't even have the courage to initially say that he was being kicked off for his topics, they tried to weasel out by saying that there was a dance marathon coming up.

https://youtu.be/fN-3DByTq6k

Can you give me one example of a right-wing academic who argues that people on the left should not be given free speech because their opinions are too dangerous? There's no such thing as a dangerous opinion, only a dangerous person who uses that opinion to inflict harm on another. People on the right wing in America care deeply about the Constitution, people on the left wing seem to think that the constitution is inherently flawed because the people who wrote it were slaveholders. Do you agree or disagree with the First Amendment of the Constitution? I happen to agree with it, but many people on the left tend to disagree with it.

I believe that hate speech is just a euphemism for limiting free speech. Who defines what is hateful and what is not? Are you aware of what is happening right now in the UK? People are literally being arrested for tweets that are islamophobic or homophobic. A comedian had to go to fucking trial because he made a joke about hating his girlfriend's dog so much that he wanted to make the dog a Nazi just so that the dog was no longer adorable. I thought it was hilarious, but a bunch of regressive leftist thought it was illegal. Talk about not understanding context in a fucking joke. Give me one example of someone on the right wing in America who wants to send someone to jail for exercising there free speech. I'm doubtful you can. I can give you dozens of examples of people around the world who want to send people to jail for tweets. And these people are all on the left."
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,f5j9gqw,t1_f5gg88d,1572223060.0,"It's easy to get a subreddit to reveal its true colors. All you have to do is express a contrary viewpoint to the prevailing groupthink to determine whether or not a subreddit is worthwhile... 

If you get downvoted for no good reason, you know that the subreddit in question is ruled by ideology and not sound argumentation. 

The same can be said about /r/enoughpetersonspam. Some people are so uncomfortable with contrary viewpoints that they actively hide in online echo-chambers in the form of message boards or subreddits. It tends to radicalize them whether they are on the right or left. There's an interesting tendency for people on the ""far-left"" socially and/or economically to think that people in the center or center-right like Jordan Peterson are extreme right. 

This is a subreddit ruled by ideology, not good arguments. Being a centrist is a good thing and making the argument that anyone to the right of you is a fascist is a retarded argument that many people on the extreme left make. 

Fascists used to make similar arguments  about people on the left by accusing literally all non-fascists of being communists even if they were not actual communists. I have studied history extensively because I used to teach High School history. It doesn't matter what side you're on, you will always be seeking to find a common enemy, whether it be the Jews, or the Communist, or the fascists, or the terrorists or whatever.

I have made a similar observation by extensively going back and forth between left and right leaning subreddits. Both the right and the left have their boogeymen. For the right it is antifa and the socialists. For the left it is fascists and white supremacists. The reality is that both antifa and white supremacy are fringe movements, but both groups like to make it out to be a massive problem. The fascinating thing about people on the left is that they actively try and shut down free speech because they think it's dangerous to give a platform people..... 

What a load of bullshit (IMHO). 

The best thing you can do if someone expresses extreme viewpoints is to shine a light on it and to show them for the fools that they are (Sascha Baron Cohen style). 

The harder you try and suppress a viewpoint, the more fuel it gives for people when it inevitably goes underground. You don't defeat white supremacy by preventing white supremacists from speaking, you let them speak and then you show then the error of their ways through sound argumentation, or you allow them to be laughed off the stage. Depends on whether or not they are willing to change.

Right-leaning subs sometimes push people around, but they generally care deeply about freedom of speech. The clear exception of course would be /r/The_Donald, to which I was instantly banned for pointing out that  the subreddit does not allow freedom of speech, in perhaps the ultimate irony that I found quite hilarious. I wasn't even mad to be honest. And who wants to talk to people that extreme anyway?

It is possible to disagree with people on /r/JordanPeterson and still get upvoted. It is just difficult. You have to present a good point and provide solid argumentation.

I posted criticisms of /r/enoughpetersonspam on their subreddit and criticized their lazy argumentation and groupthink and I was banned instantly. I went over to the Jordan Peterson subreddit and criticized Jordan and many people agreed...
 
Go figures. 

I've noticed that many people online on the left have a very low trait of openness on the Big Five Personality scale. I think it's important to entertain ideas that you disagree with or even find loathsome. It makes you a better person to not instantly retreat from an idea that you disagree with. In fact it's a mark of intellectual maturity. 

I encourage anyone who has been kind enough to read this whole thing to do your best to read what your opposition writes and listen to what they say anytime you hold a strong opinion. Even if you hate what they say and think that they're terrible people, do your best not to judge them and you might be surprised what you can learn. Don't listen to groupthink, and when you get downvoted to Hell, use that as inspiration. Never let upvotes or downvotes on Reddit make you censor yourself."

depression,f1dj9hj,t3_d6dxpl,1569386097.0,"True love is not about finding someone who is perfect, it's about finding someone who is perfect for you. I don't know if you're a man or a woman, and whether you are heterosexual or not. The same holds true whether it's a woman loving you or a man loving you. There are people out there who are also going through pain, who can understand what it feels like to go through pain. 

Some people have reached a point in which they have overcome their depression by understanding that the love of others, the love of ourselves and most importantly the love of the journey that is life... it is all we will ever have. The reason why life is hard is because it's supposed to be hard. If all you ever felt was happiness, you wouldn't be feeling true happiness because happiness is not an absence of sadness. Happiness is the fruit of the tree, sadness, depression, grief, pain, all of these negative emotions...they are the roots of the tree. They are not bad emotions, they are grounding emotions that connect you to the very real suffering that exists in the world. They help you empathize and connect to the people around you, and they help you be more of a compassionate person. Believe it or not, going through depression often makes people into better versions of themselves than they would be if they had never felt depression at all. Pain can be good, grief can be healing, suffering can strengthen you. You are also likely more intelligent (on average), because intelligent people are more prone to mental illness like depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

I felt a lot like how you feel right now because of not only my bipolar depression but because of my mania. What woman would ever want to love me? I was blown away to find that, though there were perhaps fewer women who would willingly date me, the women that did date me are remarkable because they passed an important litmus test. They were kind-hearted women because they saw value in me despite my mental illness, and in many ways my mental illness made them love me more because it made me unique and it made me a deeper person.

You only want someone to date you if they love you for who you are. If you open yourself up to love and accept the possibility that you are worthy of love, you will likely find a partner who is profoundly compassionate and loving, in the same way that you can learn to be if you learn to love yourself despite your own flaws. 

Finding someone to love you starts with loving yourself. Don't ever let anyone tell you that you are not worthy of love, and never allow yourself to believe that, despite the thoughts that you have to the contrary. You are worthy of love and it will be a love that will open your eyes to the beauty exists in the world. Remember that depression is simply a broken brain that is unable to see beauty, that has limited function and can convince people of things that are not true. It is simply untrue to say that you do not deserve to be loved because of your depression. 

Please feel free to talk to me if you would like support because I have had success finding relationships despite the fact that I am bipolar, which in some cases is trickier than ordinary depression. I'm not going to say my life was easier or harder than you though, just different. Please reach out if you have any questions whatsoever, I'm here for you."

To his credit though, he seems to have done a good job at helping to defeat Isis, and I greatly respect  the fact that he has done a lot to combat human trafficking which is a serious issue. My criticism of the right is that they are often too closed-minded about suffering, it's not that they don't care, it seems like they don't understand.

My criticism of the left is that they often weaponize anger and feelings of victimhood. Cancel culture, Twitter mobs, outrage culture. It's all about virtue signaling and trying to shut down someone with a disagree with you by calling them alt-right or a Nazi.

You hit the nail right on the head. The institutional left have no moral grounding, yet they try the hardest to make the socio-cultural/moral debate into a question of ""Oppresser"" vs ""Victim/underprivileged"". The problem is that the duality is a false one.

You are only a victim if you cannot find justice and you are incapable of forgiving others. The left frames themselves as perpetual victims, the white as perpetual Oppresser, or willingly ignorant of oppression by the ""patriarchy"".

As a result, all straight, cis, white, protestant, non-disabled middle aged men are monsters. As a result, prejudice and discrimination against a plurality (no longer a majority) becomes inevitable. White men must be stopped and black women need help.

As a result:

-Women don't trust men
-White men are seen as cruel and greedy
-Straight men are seen as intolerant
-Christians who don't make gay marriage cakes are somehow breaking the law... 
-The snake is eating its own tail. 
-America no longer has a coherent identity or set of values. 
-We attack each other. 
-Divide and conquer 101

I have an inferiority disorder because I was bullied a lot growing up. As a result when I feel like The Outsider I get very angry like this woman does. I'm a white male in his 30s, but every type of person is the same. If you feel like you're the outsider and that no one understands you you get angry. It doesn't matter if you're older young, white or black, Hispanic, or green card holder, Foreigner or domestic, people have a natural tendency to fear tribal groups that are not the same as their own. Another word for it in modern society is culture. We do not respect each other's culture and as a result we yell at each other and get afraid of each other and hurt each other.

At the age of 18 I had a psychotic break and ever since then I have been dealing with a spiritual and existential crisis that has not gone away. Please be mindful not to go too deep into this stuff. It was 9/11 conspiracy theories and the belief that George Bush was the Antichrist that made me get hospitalized. 

Take things one day at a time and remember to breathe deeply anytime you encounter anything distressing or troubling. There are already many good people fighting the good fight and society and you don't have to worry. Good prevails over evil, it just takes a while but it will ultimately win. I strongly believe that and I think it's the ultimate truth. Love is kind and compassionate and strong. Fear is angry and vindictive and weak. Choose to love your fellow human being and choose to forgive those that wrong you.

I recommend that you look into the works of Paramahansa Yogananda. As someone who left a cult-like fundamentalist church, I realized that I needed to study a loving God, not a god that is vicious and wants vengeance on humanity."

JordanPeterson,eu1s2of,t3_cedlew,1563374123.0,"Fun fact. I was banned from there when I said it wasn't a big deal that Peterson thinks feminists secretly like to be dominated, because I'm a very dominant man in regular life and I like to be dominated by women. Lots of socially dominant men and women like to be dominated sexually and there's nothing wrong with that.

Apparently that was against the rules somehow because too many people were not happy or something. Or maybe it made too much sense for them and cognitive dissonance was no longer doing enough to shield them from changing their mind."
