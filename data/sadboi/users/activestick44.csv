AZCardinals,fpszw42,t3_gfbiqa,1588882453.0,I’m a Cardinals fan born and living in Philly. I’m a lurker on this thread but love hearing about fellow out of state fans!
Anxiety,f19m4ot,t3_d89eyl,1569274299.0,There you go! That takes a lot of courage so that's really awesome that you were able to make the joke and it worked for you :)
Anxiety,f18oms8,t1_f18lkha,1569261037.0,Yes! This also happens to me
Anxiety,f18ok1r,t3_d85862,1569261004.0,Yes!! Long car trips or even a sporting event or concert that will be long. I also have a problem with peeing at work when people are in bathroom talking. Then I sit there unable to pee and get more nervous and try to wait out the people talking. It usually ends up with me holding it in and making my bladder suffer because I simply cannot shake this anxiety.
Anxiety,f18mn97,t3_d898ss,1569260189.0,"Just came here to tell you that you’re not alone. I’m 26 and had my permit years ago and was driving a lot. I almost got into an accident while practicing and that near accident traumatized me. And I have not driven since. My mom doesn’t drive and has never had her license which I feel has had impact on me. I also lost a family member 6 months ago in a car accident.  (This has all added up to one overwhelming fear) My husband and I want to start having kids and while I can take public transportation to get myself to and from work, I can’t take an infant all around the same way. I absolutely need to learn to drive again. 

I hope you get the help that you need and I’m so sorry to hear what you went through as a child! That’s something that stays with you. I hope you don’t mind me piggybacking on your request for advice because I truly need some tips too"
