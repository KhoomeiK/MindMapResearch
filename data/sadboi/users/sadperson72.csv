SuicideWatch,fe1y3h2,t3_eieayu,1578832222.0,"I said to myself before Christmas that I wouldn’t see the new year, I’m in my early 20s and since my late teens have been striving for a nice comfortable happy life but every year that goes by nothing seems to change and I end up feeling more and more down. I only told myself I wouldn’t see the new year to make myself feel better, suicide is not an option for me due to the fact I could never do that to my family but they don’t know how I feel inside. So I spent New Year’s Eve lying in bed looking out the window so annoyed that I was now in 2020 and every day that passes just feels pointless."

I have good days and bad days, the day I posted this was a bad day. But seriously thank you for taking the time to tell you story ❤️"
