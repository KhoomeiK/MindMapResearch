Now don’t get me wrong, you have to learn to love yourself at your worst weight before you can love yourself at your goal weight, but you’re not just “teaching her to love herself”, you’re insecure over the fact your daughter looks up to her aunt right now more than you, and deep down you know that. I don’t think you’re a terrible mom but right now you are failing your daughter. My own mom makes fun of me for cooking healthy and meal prepping (I am the only women under 140 pounds in my southern fried family) But I wish more than anything that my mom would support me. My advice is seriously ask yourself are you happy with what you see when you look in the mirror? No? Then change it and be an example for your kid. Start going on jogs with your daughter, start looking up and cooking healthy recipes on Pinterest together, take her to get a few new workout shorts or shirts, BE HER BIGGEST SUPPORTER AND CHEERLEADER! You guys will spend more time together and you’ll BOTH start feeling the affects of a healthier diet. Oh and for the love of god, cook some vegetables"

You ever think some stereotypes are stereotypes because there’s a minor truth to them, you literally exploded because I stated a fact that every keto enthusiast I’ve seen IN PERSON or came in contact with makes bacon wrapped everything for dinner.

Totally healthy hope this gives you some perspective” you chose to act like an ass, hope the up votes were worth it bud.

I focus on foods that benefit heart health the most (the heart disease in my family is severely high), but I would say my diet consist of water first and foremost, chicken, fish, ALLLLLL the veggies like sautéed spinach, with mushrooms and chickpeas, asparagus, etc. usually breakfast consists of 4 scrambled eggs and a slice of whole grain toast. I’m not vegan but I do love meal prepping vegan meals because they’re the easiest meal to make if you’re trying to focus on getting enough greens in your diet. I make a vegan jambalaya that’s pretty amazing and only 167 calories per bowl (and there’s alottt in a bowl). Idk man I just feel like dieting doesn’t have to be that complicated in MOST not ALL circumstances , when it comes to knowing what foods to steer away from I say just read the ingredients.

If you were my BIL and that was my daughter, I would’ve thanked you for bathing your niece but politely said “hey I know you would never do anything to your niece, but i prefer her dad be the only man that showers her.” That would have been a completely understandable way to approach the situation instead of making YOU feel like some weirdo by telling you “that’s just creepy and weird.” 
God this kind of infuriates me, I was sexually abused by a close family member in plain sight and no one had a suspicion but an uncle putting his daughter and niece in a quick shower so they don’t sit in filth, that’s weird?

We have this regular, white woman in her 50s, wears big cat eye sunglasses inside, and every ring on her fingers could pay for my college tuition - you know the type right 

She NEVER comes and sits at the bar and gets a drink, she always gets a table in the dining area with who ever it is that she’s with. She has this routine where she excuses herself from her table to go to the bathroom, walks into the bar area (restrooms are right beside my bar) hunches down behind one of our computers at the end of the bar and waves the bartender over to order a vodka on the rocks, and pounds it before she returns to her table. 
(Closet alcoholic right) 
Last time she did this she was weirder than normal. She asked me if I could put her vodka on the rocks in a plastic Togo cup with a lid on it 
I said “no mam legally we’re not allowed to put alcohol in a Togo cup sorry.” 
Oh boi did she lose it 
“I am in a rush and I need to leave but I’m not leaving a drink I just paid for.” 
It took every part of my being to not say “I’ve seen you slam those babies in 5 seconds and then stumble back to your table, take it to the head and go.” 
Instead she ended up arguing with my manager over it for about 10 minutes - as they’re arguing one of the women that vodka lady was sitting with in the dining room walks over and her face was priceless. Confused and embarrassed all in one as my manager is telling the vodka lady “mam I can not let you leave with alcohol it is a LAW.” 
The vodka lady turns around and sees the lady she’s with looking at them in horror - I shit you not without skipping a beat the vodka lady turns back around, with the biggest smile on her face, looks at my manager, and goes “have a lovey evening” THEN HUGS MY MANAGER AS IF SHE KNEW HER ,turns around and ushers the lady she’s with to follow her. 
I can only imagine the backward ass story she told her friend, but in that moment I realized I don’t get paid enough to babysit alcoholics."
