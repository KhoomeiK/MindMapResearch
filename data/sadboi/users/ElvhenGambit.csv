AskReddit,ffwh5th,t3_evb8of,1580300854.0,"**Alcohol and illicit drugs don't actually make people happy and may not numb emotions--they can actually magnify emotions you're already feeling.** If you drink while angry, you might get belligerent. If you use drugs when you're upset, you might have a bad trip. Obviously, everybody reacts differently within that and there are countless other factors that determine someone's reaction to drugs, but many find that the emotions they experience while sober are magnified.

If you've ever had an alcoholic relative, for example, you may have seen this, even if they deny it. Many people that abuse alcohol are looking from an escape from negative emotions. Many of those have diagnosable depression before abusing the drug. I definitely do not mean to imply that people with depression or those battling addiction are inherently aggressive. That is not true.

What *is* true is that alcohol especially affects us in a top-down fashion while decision making happens through a bottom-up procedure. When drinking, the first functions to go are those that are most sophisticated. In this case, that would be in the neocortex, responsible for higher order thinking, decision making and inhibition. If you don't have that rational part of your brain to calm down and make better decisions, you're more likely to act in ways you wouldn't while sober. Your most complex brain functions are the last to be consulted when making decisions. Your limbic system (system responsible for processing emotion) is the first line of defense when making decisions and is the highest-order function you have when intoxicated. In this case, your decisions most closely reflect your emotional state and will likely magnify whatever emotions you're feeling. 

This specific example isn't necessarily the case with all drugs, but pieces of it remain similar.

aspergers,ff3hic9,t3_era62b,1579541149.0,"Disclaimer: I'm only sharing this to corroborate everyone else's stories/comments and am not trying to complain about my life. 

I feel like I've had to walk this fine line between having and not having a disability my entire life.

When I was a kid, it was very clear that I was intelligent and everyone around me had really high expectations of me. They said I was destined to be the head of the family, be super successful (and rich), get my doctorate, and basically become a celebrity. I will be the 1st to get a bachelor's on one side of my family this May...and I can't admit to anybody how much I've struggled and how much I'm currently struggling for my degree. It took me 3 years to get accommodations that I'm just now able to use. Apparently, I was masking so well at intake interviews that they didn't believe my paperwork was legitimate. It took me almost killing myself and having the worst term of my life for anyone to believe me. 

I can't focus on anything. If I feel like I'll mess something up, I can't touch it, think about it, or talk about it without having a panic attack. I really, really suck at regulating my emotions, despite years of therapy and drugs. It's extremely hard for me to get up in the morning (anxiety, depression, fatigue). When I do, I can dissociate to a point where I can't really tell what's going on even if I was totally with it a few seconds before. I can't be as neurotypical as I looked in the interview, I guess, and that totally fucks with people.

And I still feel *extremely* guilty claiming I have a disability because I'm physically able, I graduated high school in the top 10% of my class (nowhere near that in college ngl), and I've grown up having to be amazing at compartmentalizing/masking and completely neglecting my own needs in public at all times.

Usually, I have to explain these things to people that don't get it. Here, I'm just glad to be able to share with people that do. Thank you for being an awesome community."
