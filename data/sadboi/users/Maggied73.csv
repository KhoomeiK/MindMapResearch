People who can‚Äôt see well get glasses, people who cant hear use hearing aids. If you struggle to feel happy, if your brain doesn‚Äôt produce as much serotonin as other peoples, that‚Äôs okay you can remedy it. I tried so many other things before going to SSRIs and a bit of CBT, and found that this was the most effective solution. Just try it, what is there to loose right?"
