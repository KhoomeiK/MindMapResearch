DepressionRecovery,fp4rmf9,t1_fp4bdlp,1588305666.0,"That’s a hard question to answer because when I was a child/teen I didn’t put much effort into things.  Now that I’m older I could be a perfectionist.  I don’t like to do things poorly.

Yes, I don’t know if it’s an easy question for me to answer.

Did you do anything specific to try to get over the perfectionism or did just knowing it seem to help?"
DepressionRecovery,fo15f93,t1_fnva1vo,1587426114.0,"Thanks for sharing your story.  I’ve been tested for celiac and don’t have it, but I try to keep gluten low to help my IBS symptoms."
DepressionRecovery,fnv0kjp,t1_fnur4gm,1587276390.0,It usually is criticism but it’s hard because that same criticism doesn’t bother me at all at other times.  The inconsistency is maddening.
DepressionRecovery,fnv0ilk,t1_fnukjfs,1587276342.0,Thanks for sharing.  I’m so glad to hear I’m not alone in this.
DepressionRecovery,fnv0h8u,t1_fnukgo2,1587276309.0,Wow!  This is me to a t.  Will build habits and then drop and lose all the progress.  It’s an exhausting cycle.
DepressionRecovery,fnv0f30,t1_fnst436,1587276256.0,"Sounds exactly like me, especially the low profile and impulsivity.  I have made impulsive choices (took medical leave once) while in the state."
DepressionRecovery,fnv0cay,t1_fnthpau,1587276189.0,"This is what I’ve been exploring with my doctor.  I do feel very anxious, particularly with social stuff when I have pms.  

However, sometimes it is mid cycle though my doctor says there is a changeover of hormones mid cycle that could be contributing.  I’ve been working on tracking a few different things."

depression,f9p0uz1,t3_cml6ni,1575518530.0,Couldn’t make it to work today.  Feeling very low and start of cycle.  Thought I could at least do dishes or cleaning but couldn’t muster the energy.  Basically just a waste of space.  Going to bed early as can’t miss another day of work.
depression,f850v58,t3_dz1kju,1574265176.0,"Don’t take out those student loans.  You will regret it.  And pursue consistent therapy rather than calling someone when you can’t manage, stop when you can and repeat continuously."
depression,f839bbi,t3_dyorge,1574207159.0,Today I made it to work ten minutes earlier and took my medication.  I tracked my food thus far.  I’ll track my finances this evening.  I’m also going to make it to a support meeting tonight.
depression,f8084cx,t3_dy9fou,1574122666.0,Therapists aren’t qualified to give a medical diagnosis.  They are masters level trained.  You need a PhD.  A psychiatrist is the one that gives diagnoses.
depression,f7w2koh,t3_dxp0co,1574029225.0,This describes me perfectly except my concentration is so bad that I can’t read anymore.  I used to write but can’t manage any words nowadays.
depression,f7jx5ow,t3_dwc31q,1573788763.0,I put on weight.  Now so heavy can’t have anyone touch me.  Figures I got it the wrong way *sighs*
dysthymia,f6o8j6p,t3_dnqm28,1573010338.0,Work as a teacher for many years.  I’ve had a couple breaks (couple years and few months respectively) due to mental health but generally been employed for 15 years.  Fear of homelessness gets me up each morning and off to work.
depression,eqdcfei,t3_by5b3v,1559987054.0,"This is exactly how I’m feeling tonight.  It’s 2:40 am and I am just lying here thinking about how much of a waste of space I am and how I would be better off dead.  I won’t kill myself or anything.  

Will try to sleep again.  Sigh!"
DaveRamsey,ep2s2jn,t3_btr40l,1559012140.0,Can I make a suggestion.  If you live in an area with a good transit system then I would delay purchasing a car for as long as you can.  I pay one average $600 between gas and insurance (I have a long commute).  I wish I could go back to bussing.
