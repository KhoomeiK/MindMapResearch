sex,fpp0wfj,t3_geqri5,1588794026.0,"Man, it sounds like you just think too much. Someone can be overweight and be actually healthier than someone with a ""normal"" body. Just because someone is a overweight, it doesn't necessarily mean that they're living an unhealthy life; for example, for me, it's ridiculously hard to lose weight because of my metabolism. I'm not *that* overweight, but a little bit. Even if I tried to lose weight by eating right and exercising, it would take me a lot of time to reach normal weight. Been there, done that.

It's okay to like what you like, as long as you don't push anyone to fit that ideal of yours. There are curvy women who are 100% confident with their bodies and wouldn't like to change. Maybe you should just find someone like that. Don't think too much."
