If it’s a bestie, we’ve already sent nudes to each other to ‘check them’ before sending to dudes soooo I’d probs just compliment and hype her up!! 

If it’s just a girl I’m friends with but not bestie and we aren’t that close- I’d just say it’s cool, don’t worry bout it. I wouldn’t think nothing of it

If it’s a guy... this would depend on his personality and our friendship. If I trust that it was a mistake, I’d have the same reaction to a girl doing it. If it’s like a fuckboy, I’d have a stern word bout it"

16?!? You want to possibly wait until 16? 

I understand you’re coming from a place of concern and care. And your points are definitely valid. However, that’s the reality of puberty. None of us were ready to stand up for ourselves at 12. None of us knew what to do with male attention at 12. 

But consider the alternative. Your daughter is stuck in a preteens body until 16? When all the other girls are starting to look like young women? How will she feel toward you? Toward other girls? I’d be pretty envious if at 16 I still looked like I did at 12. We already have enough self image / body issues as it is. 

I think you and your wife need to have a discussion and really take into consideration that your daughter is only asking for normalcy. She isn’t asking for a new phone. She’s asking that her body works in a way that all the other girls in her class. For such a young age, she’s had a lot taken from her. She may be quite mature for her age. And her request, imo, is pretty mature as well. She wants her body to do what everybody else’s body is doing. What her body would be doing if that didn’t happen with her ovaries."

If your husband wants time after work to decompress, he can take on the nighttime care. 

The way I see it- you both have work. Except your job includes childcare. Plus you don’t sleep. 

Big deal if he has to do for 3 hours what you do for the remaining 21 hours. If he wants to switch so badly, go ahead."

AmItheAsshole,fneeypr,t1_fnedpt6,1586888169.0,"I understand but that’s kinda the reality of hanging out. You don’t set a time to go home, at least I don’t. 

When my bf is out with friends I’m not hounding him for a schedule. If it’s time for dinner, then a simple “you gonna come home soon or should I eat without you?” Would do. Because when I’m out with the girls, I don’t want someone being all “what time you coming home” every couple hours. 

Plus she could’ve very well meant to come home but tbh time passes you. How many times have you been with a friend and were about to leave, even said goodbye, only to continue talking?"

It’s about combat ptsd but the author describes ptsd in a way that made me feel so so so understood. I couldn’t finish the book because it was such a hard read, I ended up giving it to a friend that’s a vet. And I don’t think he’s even opened it yet tbh. 

I do plan on buying it again and finishing it. But it just understands you in such a way that is truly remarkable. I recommend it completely but definitely know that it’s rough going in. I took breaks every couple pages to just breathe and ground myself."

I understand why you feel that way and you are certainly valid for it. 

However, I know me personally, if I randomly saw an old friend I could talk for hours with them. Just this year I ran into someone I knew from last semester and we talked for about 2 hours on a bench by where we ran into each other. And I knew them literally from 1 semester ago. Imagine if it had been years? 

She was messaging you and updating you. She didn’t seem to ignore you. She seems pretty transparent about the situation, I’d give her the benefit of the doubt. 

I do recommend talking to her about how you feel though, in a non accusing way. You shouldn’t hold on to feelings like this in a relationship."

I can feel how fed up you are. And what you’re doing is petty but I get it. Sometimes people push too hard and you’ve had enough. 

I recommend either having a talk with them about communicating less often or just only pick up when you feel like talking. Ive had to do the latter with family before. It’s hard, but some people don’t really accept any other way."
