There is a number for setting up appointments, some hospitals have English translations on their site, some do not-just use google translate, or don't, since there is usually just one number available, so it's easy to figure out.
Most doctors speak English here, so you shouldn't have trouble with this. Unless you don't live in Prague or a bigger city, but I'm assuming you live in Prague.
