AmItheAsshole,fnigebt,t1_fni7zbf,1586979545.0,"Uh, because in my eyes they are? You're still being really aggressive and rude. Please stop commenting on my posts."
AmItheAsshole,fnfzqq9,t1_fnel5am,1586918996.0,"Uh, you don't have to get rude. That was unnecessary. You don't know the situation like I do, therefore you can't act like you do. I don't know what makes you think you have the right to not only talk to me like I'm stupid and then act like you even know what's going on within their divorce as if you were apart of it. And, might I also say, I made a typo. They DIDN'T finish the papers, they're technically not LEGALLY divorced, my dad just doesn't live with my mother anymore. Either way, you have no reason to talk to me like I'm less than you. It was not cool."
AmItheAsshole,fneidix,t1_fn7kvao,1586889908.0,"They finished papers, they never went to court, nothing went through the law enforcement. It wasn't at all amicable, and no decision was made other than my father had to leave and me and my siblings never got a say in who we went with. It may be her house, but nothing, by law, is hers that they bought together. Unless it goes through the courts, where a judge says it goes to her in the divorce, last I was told it does not belong to her."
AmItheAsshole,fnehs8k,t1_fn7l3r8,1586889607.0,"According to my friends with divorced parents, it IS normal. Also, I don't switch houses. I will be living with my dad from now on, and solely visiting my mom. I do not feel like there is the need to keep it there. No one in my family does, my mother even admitted it. But she says it will stay there because it's ""hers."""
AmItheAsshole,fn6xdgy,t3_fzvxw7,1586709199.0,NTA. Most people probably would've reacted that way.

AmItheAsshole,fn6w11d,t1_fn5pzpl,1586708454.0,"Just a little note- It's furniture THEY both bought for me, therefore she has no full right to it because my father put in money for it. Not to sound rude if I did, I just wanted to add that little bit in case it was something I left out in the story. She didn't get anything through the divorce, she just never let my father have a say in it. (It wasn't a legally settled divorce.)"
depression,fd0bjrd,t3_eczhm3,1578116492.0,"Your family doesn't seem like a real family to me. Whatever your heart tells you will benefit you now, later, 50 years into the future is what you should do. Personally I would go with the friend. But it's up to you, and no matter what your decision is you aren't a bad person."

No one knows but my friends."
lgbt,ewgno1o,t3_cnx4ab,1565386029.0,I actually love this! You should be hella confident in yourself!
AskReddit,ewgm7ev,t3_cnuawn,1565385040.0,"I do it mainly for self conscious reasons. I don't want to make myself look stupid or bad in general so I type it and then delete it thinking how dumb that could sound.  
*I'm very introverted too-*"
