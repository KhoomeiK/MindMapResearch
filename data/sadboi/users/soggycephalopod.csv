I've had some native/fluent speakers tell me that my accent was really good after doing Pimsleur. My accent was terrible before that, mostly because I was apathetic in HS. I also used Pimsleur to learn enough Spanish, German, Hebrew, and Vietnamese to have basic conversation. I don't know how my Hebrew and Vietnamese accents were, but after a few months I was able to speak and understand well enough that I could hold a basic conversation with native speakers. I feel like I did better with Vietnamese--the Hebrew pronunciation was really hard for me. The problem with Vietnamese is that Pimsleur and a lot of courses are North Vietnamese and all of the people in the US are South Vietnamese, but most older people can speak and understand both. I was actually really surprised when one day I had a short conversation back and forth with a Vietnamese monk and we could both understand each other pretty well.

One of the interesting/funny things about learning entirely by ear was that in Spanish I picked up the b/v ambiguity with words like vamonos and the sort of softer d sound in de nada and didn't realize it until I tried to read Spanish and got confused by how it was written. There are probably more glaring examples of that kind of stuff with other languages, but I never tried to read anything other than romance languages.

No experience with Japanese, but I'd recommend the Spanish courses. I've heard a lot of people echo what I'm saying--that Pimsleur is really good for learning pronunciation, grammar, verbs, and just generally getting a feel for the flow of the language, but then you need something like Rosetta Stone or Duolingo to fill in all the vocabulary (especially nouns) you don't know."

BPDrecovery,f44egb5,t1_f409lnx,1571351107.0,"I'd never heard of ""emotion permanence,"" but I looked it up, and one of my therapists basically told me the same thing. She was saying that the struggle I have with love isn't lack of love, but an inability to hold experiences of love inside. If I could learn how to allow the love to fill me up, then when I'm alone or it feels like there's a rift in the relationship I could touch in on that love in me and know that I'm still loved. Or, if the intensity drops, I can touch back in on how I felt before. She said it was the same for anger. Not that we should hold a grudge, but allowing the emotional experience to stay with us would help with not forgiving and forgetting too soon and making the same mistakes again... which I'm seriously guilty of.

From what I understand I think this is the same thing as identity. It's lack of identity and lack of self-love that puts us at the mercy of whatever we're experiencing in the moment. From what I've learned about myself I feel like this is the most core thing of this whole BPD thing. I don't really know what to do about it, though--I'm going back into therapy with a new therapist in a couple of months with the soul purpose of working on this.

BPDrecovery,f40988p,t3_dihrpo,1571289608.0,"I've struggled a lot with this too.

I can fall in love (way too easily), but it only *feels* like love to me when it's an intense, passionate whirlwind. I'm seriously guilty of ""love bombing."" I know that this isn't what a long term relationship is really like; I know that the dopamine settles and that love deepens over time, but that feeling of deep connection feels like something other than love to me.

I have children too, and it's the same for them. I'm sure I love my children, but when I try to connect the feelings I have for my children to ""love"" it feels like there's a wall of confusion between how I feel for them and how I should feel, or how other people seem to feel.

It's like love is intense and all-consuming and anything that isn't like that is... confusing?

I've worked on this in therapy quite a bit, and my best understanding is that there are a couple of things going on. First is identity. I've been told you can't *really* feel love when you're empty inside. Your own identity is part of loving others--it's *you* loving *another*, not just emptiness and love, if that makes sense? I've been given some exercises to work on identity, but it's still a big struggle for me. I still have a lot of work to do on identity.

The second thing is that I've been told the way I'm approaching love is actually selfish. It's an attempt to fill a hole inside of me, for me, not for the other person. It feels intense because it's proportional to how intense the emptiness feels. I hated hearing this, but the more I've settled on it, the truer it seems.

I feel like practicing intentional empathy helps. You can't empathize when you're in full self-preservation mode, so, for me, I have to be intentional about empathy to really feel for other people. I use imagery to consciously imagine myself in their life. I've noticed that if I do this with my SO or my children, I *feel* for them. I want the best for them. I don't want them to be hurt.

weightlifting,f3vyda1,t3_dif74q,1571187648.0,"There's a lot of stuff to work on, but I think these are the most glaring problems:

1. The bar should go to a certain hight after it leaves your hips and then **pull yourself under** the bar. Don't press it out overhead. As a starter it'll feel like it propels up from the pull at your hips and you drop under and catch. As you get better it'll become less ""drop under"" and more aggressively pull yourself under, but to start with just let yourself get under to catch it.
2. Speaking of pushing yourself under the bar, the position your body is in when you press this out is not at all ready to squat. You should be catching it in an overhead squat position. Think about a squat position--feet shoulder width apart, butt back, chest up, etc. What you're doing is more like a limbo under the bar. If it's a light weight you can catch it high (power snatch), but your body should always be in position to squat. As it gets heavier, the only option will be to catch it lower or miss.

Practice this with just the bar. Snatch it, catch it overhead with no overhead pressing (lower your body however much you have to). Once you catch it go ahead and overhead squat all the way down. If you have to adjust your feet or push your butt back before you squat, then you didn't really catch it in the right spot. Adjust and do it again.

Go up in weight *slowly*. Post a form check with an empty bar if you have to, then one with the lightest plates you have. Check your ego--the best weightlifters in the world have done tons of work with the empty bar. You'll lift a heck of a lot more weight in the long run by mastering the skills first.

I'm assuming you don't have anybody to work with who knows how to lift? If you can even get once a week coaching for a couple of months and then just practice on your own that would be huge."

Basically techniques for challenging our automatic thought processes. For example, my SO doesn't want to spend time with me.

CBT would have you break it apart. The only fact in this whole situation is ""my SO needs alone time."" What are some other reasons this could be? Everybody needs alone time sometimes--maybe it actually has nothing to do with me at all. What's a different way I could interpret this? What different way can I respond?

It happens with bipolar and schizophrenia too, where it's all sympathetic and not the person's fault that they have delusions/mania/whatever, until they do something harmful, and then they get categorized as a bad person. Depression and anxiety are more of an inward crash, so less threatening to others and more sympathetic.

I kind of get it from a psychology perspective. We assume people are capable of self-regulation and hold them accountable for their actions. Mental illness is hidden. We can't see the mental illness--all we can see is that someone is acting out, which triggers our natural inclination to blame them. It's even worse with personality disorders, where the illness is all woven up into who we actually are. It doesn't make it remotely okay to blame people for their own suffering, but I get why people do it.

Not sure how to quantify how ""lopsided"" they are, but they're definitely lopsided. Women were basically property in not-to-distant history. They're still treated like property in some parts of the world, and more or less subjugated in various subcultures. Women in the US couldn't vote until 1920. Female ""firsts"" are still happening all the time where men have been doing these things for centuries.

How would admitting power address this? We just manipulate men with sex and everything would be okay? The entire purpose of feminism is for women to be valued for more than their bodies. Do you think using sex as a power dynamic would further that goal?

&#x200B;

>However, by vilifying ""nice guys"", feminists are flipping the script and place the full blame solely on the guy in order to deflect from female shittiness.

Women don't vilify *actual* nice guys. Authentic ""nice"" doesn't have an ulterior motive. Being nice in order to get something and then dropping the facade is more than a little manipulative. I can empathize with the confused experience of guys trying to learn how to ""get the girl"" and I'm not trying to vilify guys that don't know any better, but they've been grossly mislead on how women work. If you want a relationship, pursue a relationship. If you're nice, just be authentically nice. If you pretend to be nice to get something and don't actually communicate what you want, don't get upset when she mistakes your nice act for nothing more than actual niceness.

&#x200B;

>Think of it: one of the biggest issues of feminism is that looks shouldn't matter.

The specific issue you're thinking of is that the value of a woman shouldn't be measured based on her body. She should be able to perform in her job and various other roles without being sexualized. Of course looks matter, but looks shouldn't define value. Despite what you might think with SMV theory and other things like that, men are not valued based on their looks. Feminism isn't a hive mind, but this is what feminism means to a lot of people. Value me as a full, proper person. Simple as that.

&#x200B;

>Ultimately, it requires realizing that a lot of the value women have for men comes from them being potential partners (which ultimately includes having sex with them, i.e. objectification); and that women would have a hard time generating male interest absent that fact, just by virtue of having a sharp wit or a winning personality.

I don't even know what to say to this. Women are just sex objects and all they have to do is realize it? The ""truth"" is, our only value is sex? This is your ultimate seppuku. Women are actual people with brains.

Have you tried thinking about what ""friendzone"" actually is? Friendzone without the misaligned expectations is just a friend. Friends are extremely valuable. Women are human--women value friendship. In order to even come up with the ""friendzone"" concept, guys are basically devaluing friendship. They're using friendship as a strategy of getting at romance or sex, and then saying they're not satisfied with the achievement of her friendship. If I matter as a person, then why is my friendship not of value to you?

I pretty much agree with everything you wrote. I'm a weightlifter, which is a technical sport, but also obviously a strength sport. As expected, the elite men in weightlifting eclipse the elite women, but to your point (and mine), the top women lifters significantly out-lift what even an experienced/trained intermediate male lifter can accomplish. The difference in genetic potential isn't enough to make mixed-sex competitions fair, but it's enough that the best women outperform a significant number of even athletic, trained men, let alone probably *everyone* who hasn't.

On OPs, question, I don't really know. It's complicated. My sport is important to me, and I feel like trans people should be able to participate in sports if it's important to them. I don't feel like it's right for them to have an unfair advantage or to punish women for the sake of inclusion. I think we can write best-effort policies, use our best judgement, and mostly figure out what's appropriate. Since it's the one sport I'm most into, I've read the USA weightlifting's guide on trans people, and it's pretty much what I'm describing here. Transwomen have to be three years post gonadectomy, hormone measurements, doctor's report, legal sex changes, committee's judgement, etc. The rules seem strict but also with a clear intent of inclusion and fairness.

BPD,f2evk0z,t3_dd45an,1570204782.0,"So, this.

I stayed in my marriage way too long, all because I *needed* to be loved. I don't know if it was that I was afraid to be alone or that I thought I'd never find anything else, but I ignored the signs for years.

My marriage was emotionally toxic, but at least it was physically safe. When that finally reached the nth breaking point, I left and immediately shacked up with an abusive a\*\*hole. This was way worse. They would cut me down verbally, gaslight me, and break my things in fits of rage.  The warning signs were there in flashing neon from day 1, but I didn't feel like I could stop. It was like I was being pulled forward by an invisible force, compelled to make bad decision after bad decision.

I'd never been involved in a domestic violence call for my entire life before that, but the police were called for domestic violence at least three times that year. During one of the breakups, I tried to take care of myself and bought a couple of things I loved. Then, when we got back together they got pissed and guilted me because I was trying to move on and do something healthy for myself.

The craziest thing is that even after we broke up I would downplay the bad parts, idolize the good parts and keep going back. We ""broke up"" more times than I can count. My friends kept trying to warn me, but I wouldn't listen. I finally stopped going back when my ex spent the night in jail for assaulting me. I came the closest I'd ever come to killing myself that night, not because of anything physical but just because I felt more worthless than I'd ever felt in my entire life. Even now, after everything, saying ""abusive a\*\*hole"" feels unnatural, like despite everything, some part of my mind is still trying to say ""it wasn't all that bad. It could have worked."" Yuck.

I'd had lots of therapy and was trying hard to be a healthier version of myself through all of this, but I wasn't even diagnosed until after this whole thing. In some ways it was a huge relief to finally understand why I'd made such horrible decisions.

Sorry--that was a bit *all about me* on your post. I don't think I've talked about any of this enough. Anyway, you're definitely not the only one to feel like this.

GCdebatesQT,f2b1c6i,t1_f29s8h7,1570120490.0,"Different user, but pretty sure I get what /u/deadloop_ is getting at.

I teach personality analysis and this is something people often get confused about. The personality tests provide different personality metrics, like assertiveness, etc. Say you score a 30 on assertiveness--that, by itself is meaningless. The metrics are given meaning by rating them on a bell curve in comparison to all the other people who've been measured in the past, which lets you know how much higher or lower 30 is than other people.

Some people have a kickback to the comparison part of this--they'd like to know what their personality is in isolation, not in comparison to other people. I have to explain that there is no such thing as personality in isolation--personality is entirely how we relate to other people, and as a mirror of this, how our inner voice relates to ourself. If I was the only person on earth how could I be an assertive person? Being particularly assertive means there are people out there who are less assertive--it's *always* a comparison of where you fit into the social structure.

Not sure how I feel about the analogy of using the same concept for gender, but I think /u/deadloop_ is saying that gender also doesn't exist in isolation. My only confusion with this is what it looks like in a practical sense. We already have words like masculine/feminine for comparative gender expression. Would this imply you could be varying degrees of ""woman?"" I think I get what ""is a relation"" means, but the practical implications of this are pretty confusing."

1. Self-sufficiency is about so much more than money. Are you responsible, confident, competent at something, can take care of yourself, etc? These are all attractive traits.

You don't really, fully develop these things until you've had some time to settle into adulthood.
2. For most adults a man in his 30s is in his prime. He's old enough to be fully matured and comfortable in his skin, and young enough to have the physical attraction of youth. If you're older than your 20s yourself, which most adults obviously are, early 20s is still *usually* a kid.
3. A physically attractive 30 or 40 y/o says a lot more about a person than an attractive 20 y/o. Lots of people are fit in their 20s, but that gets less and less as a person gets older. Staying fit as you age usually means you're a healthier person overall.

She had me do a visualization exercise where I imagined someone sitting across the room--someone I could imagine feeling love for. Not a real person, but sort of like a fantasy FP. She asked me to think of all of the things I'm good at, and to imagine the fantasy person has those same interests, same personality traits, etc--to close my eyes and *really* imagine that this person is sitting right there AND to keep feeling my love for them.

Doing this I realized I could love ""myself"" pretty easily if it was over there, in someone else... just not when it was actually me.

That's a wholesome, family-oriented perspective, but there are a lot of different reasons relationships break up. It's not always possible, or even a good idea to try to force a relationship that doesn't work. It could be abusive, or a drug/alcohol problem, or the father could be in another relationship.

Sometimes maybe they should get back together, have therapy, or whatever. Some people just need to learn how to communicate better.

Even when it feels frantic and unmanageable, it changes things to know you've handled it before. It's incredibly hard sometimes, but it's worth it to keep working at it. You'll be happier and life will be easier.

This is really good that you have this. One thing my SO does is tells me ""I still love you.""

""I love you today and I'll still love you tomorrow.""

""I'm mad at you because \_\_\_... but I still love you.""

""I just want to be by myself, but I still love you.""

""I'm not going anywhere. I'll always love you.""

This is huge for me.

I know what I should be doing to contain myself, but it feels impossible to do it in the moment. ""I still love you"" is like a reminder. Like, oh, okay... I still *really hate thi*s, but maybe the world isn't crumbling down around me. It *will be* okay again. It gives me just enough security to do things to calm down and contain myself."

I don't know the history or the reasoning, though--maybe there is a direct link to real-world harm. \*shrug\*"
