So initially there were external factors causing the depression and they disappeared and your depression lifted. I relate to this however, sometimes it is difficult to see the wood through the trees. Maybe that is similar to your current position? Maybe you have got rid of what you thought was causing the depression again but it is actually something else?

The main supplements which there is evidence for are omega 3 and B12 (for low energy), if you have omega three in your diet there should be no need for supplementation, although there is no guarantee that you will get the amount on a regular basis without supplementation."

depression_help,eswo816,t3_c9bxg6,1562318028.0,"Wow looks like you are doing everything right. I believe neuroplasticity is a thing when you are young and gets difficult to achieve the older you get. I think neurochemistry is at the heart of many cases. Typical antidepressants work in around 40% of cases but Im not sure they cure anything only they lift the fog enough so you don't commit suicide and have enough juice to change your behaviour patterns. They say entheogens can help cure depression but there's mixed data and a lot of hype but it looks promising. Other than there are five things which are 100% proven to lift depression. 1. Excercise, I have had luck with this, at a minimum you should aim for 1 hour a day for at least three times a week. 2. Reduce ruminating - the brain enjoys chewing the cud of the past, try cordon this off and look to now and the future only. 3. Counselling - you seem to be doing this, maybe look online for Skype therapy? It's cheaper... Maybe look to friends and colleagues and be more open with them = free counselling sessions! 4. Socialising this can be difficult and excruciating at times but like excercise you have to push yourself into it. 5. Supplements for me omega 3, vitamin d and b bits seem to help. 

This won't cure it but it will help somewhat. What have you done for you which you think has been effective? Like if you cut out all of the fluff what do you think worked for you?"
