awakened,fq8zpzf,t1_fq8z6w4,1589180533.0,"And to address another part of your question, sometimes it's hard for me to tell how much is or isn't changing but I've been getting a ton of reflections from people who've known me a while. They can tell that I'm different.  And there are some empirical differences too.  After decades of needing prescriptions to basically function in the work without going into a debilitation anxiety attack, I'm pretty much off of all of it. I don't need it anymore. When I feel like shit now, I just \*compassionately\* let myself feel like shit instead of arguing with my reality or repressing it or medicating it, and the craziest thing is that it passes. 

The awakening experience was like, this huge affirmation that I was doing something right and also just showed me what my path is going to look like for the immediate future, but I'm still back in the muck. I just saw the light, and I saw the map that gets me there. Its cool shit."
awakened,fq8z6w4,t1_fq6dokm,1589180043.0,"It didn't last, but it showed me what it looks like. All of this work feels like a few steps forward, a couple back, over and over.  I was thinking about your question today when I was walking around and I thought of one aspect of it that revealed itself for me. It takes a while to work with trauma when you're on the path, not because there's something you need to ""get through"". It's more like you're learning how to ""be with"" your discomfort and pain. That's the key. And eventually that means being willing to be quiet, still and compassionate towards your pain, without avoidance, deflection, minimizing, catastrophizing, any of it. That was the key. For me it felt like lots and lots of surrender and acceptance towards the entire picture, the parts that feel strong, the parts I think are unloveable, the parts that aren't healed yet, and learning to just... be with it all. I'm practicing it a lot these days but it's been a pretty powerful tool that's created a lot of change for me over time. I think at first, being totally present with one's own trauma is too painful for people to get the hang of it right away and it's not necessarily intuitive initially how to allow for discomfort and pain and shadow. It takes a bit of babystepping into it, but then for me I saw myself getting stronger as I was willing to acknowledge and accept and care for parts of myself that I had pretty much exiled. These days I'm a bit of a detective for that stuff. Jealousy? Anxiety? Feeling fucked over? Time to go back in and radically accept and care for myself and reallly realllly listen to my unmet needs and see how to meet them internally."

One of the big reveals was that all of the trauma was PART of it. I always was trying to get through the trauma to the other side, but the trauma itself was actually fully integrated into the awakening experience. There wasn't a single moment of my life that wasn't important. In fact, the bedrock of the whole thing was finally fully accepting myself completely, as I am, as life has happened to me, in full, with total compassion. The good, bad, ugly, unfair -- everything got a seat at the table of my is-ness. It was the most incredible experience I've ever had by a factor of 100."

editors,fovy1ug,t1_fousgwc,1588109532.0,"When I started in Premiere I used to do that but now basically every edit sequence has a version number, say v1.0. If I make a substantial change and want to dupe the sequence so I can reference back to the earlier one, I’ll up the number after the decimal, so v1.1, v1.2. If the client gives me notes, the number before the decimal rolls over, so we’re now onto v2.0. I’m so used to checking my version numbers as I start, i don’t get it twisted anymore.

I use timelines to lay out ENTIRE batches of footage for various categories so when I’m looking for b-roll on a specific scene, say, I can bounce over to my b-roll timeline and scrub it. I’ll bump favorites up to v2 sometimes so I can instantly see them. It’s just faster and more intuitive for me than clicking on icons to see b-roll. I’ll even begin breaking down interviews by laying the entire thing on a timeline that corresponds to the transcription time code, and bump my selects up to V2.
