Alcoholism_Medication,f1a1t94,t3_d51sxl,1569283332.0,"I have been taking Antabuse since mid July,  and so far it is working for me. The cravings are easing, although I still have my moments.
The fear of suffering the affects of drinking while taking the medication has stopped me having alcohol, but I wondered if it was actually going to do what it said on the information sheet that came with it. So I went days when I “forgot” to take my meds and thought I would try and have and have a little drink. Biggest mistake ever... within 10 minutes my face started heating up and turned bright red, it felt like someone was poking hot needles in my eyes, they were burning, my head was on fire, I was shaking all over, my heart was racing and i felt like I couldn’t breathe, I felt like I was going to die, it lasted for over an hour then slowly eased off. I’m never, ever going to try that again.
I’m glad that I did it now, when I think about alcohol or go somewhere people a drinking I know that there is no way I’m going to be tempted to have a drink, it is just not worth it, I’ll happily stick to my ginger ale!"

It has helped with the physical side of not drinking, but I still have mental cravings.... I’m hoping that with time I will over come the mental side also.

stopdrinking,f19xct4,t3_d6pc37,1569280528.0,"After many years of not admitting to being an alcoholic I finally have, my close family are the only ones that know, I tell everyone else I’m on medication and can’t drink (which is actually true as I’m taking Antabuse - which they don’t know).... it’s like it’s embarrassing to admit to alcoholism. I wish I wasn’t so ashamed of myself. So yes, I will try to remind myself that I am kicking ass, i am kicking alcohol in the ass."

I’m crying now just thinking about it, damm it!"
