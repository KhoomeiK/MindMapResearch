Read The One Thing by Gary Keller. Or 10 Steps to Earning Awesome Grades (While Studying Less) By Thomas Frank.
You can read these books to achieve what you want. In case you don't have money to buy the book you can also enroll yourself in a free Coursera course on How to learn.

And if you don't want to waste time on these things then just study in 25 min blocks and take a 5 min break. During the break, quickly explain yourself what you've learned. (Lookup for pomodoro technique). And just don't panic. That shit is only going to fuck your mind. And I wouldn't suggest you to study for 8 hours everyday. 4 hours (as science say) is the average amount of time a person works as its peak. Do this and you will finish the courses.

Feb 2019. I thought I can't focus on reading. I had bought a couple of books but it was a struggle to read it for even 1 minute. I thought it's not my fault because the books I bought aren't interesting. So I bought a couple more. Still the problem wasn't resolved.

July 2019. I read a lot. This morning I read around 50 pages of fiction and last night read a little more than I decided I would. And after a few minutes, I am going to read a couple pages more. What has changed?

I promised myself I would read. Even if it's for 10 seconds. I didn't said I would read 1 page, I said I would read for 1 minute. I was too lazy to read even for a minute so I shortened my goal to just skimming what I read and that would take around 5-10 for me. I did it over and over again. Started journaling. Made a to list to read. Repeated it everyday. Sometimes I missed but never gave up. I made reminders to read. I prioritized reading. Heck, I even deleted all of my games so that I can take some time off for reading. Yeah boy I'm now obsessed with reading. I guess you know what to do to create an obsession like this?

TL;DR: remove the friction as much as possible. Wanna read a book. Read for a minute everyday. It's 11:58 PM and didn't read yet? Read for the remaining 2 minutes. Everyday. Just do it. Even if doesn't make sense. Train your brain. Make it a habit.  That's how you become consistent. Commit yourself. Write down what you want to do. It will help.

I can help you. I started exercising like months ago. I had never exercised before. How did I convinced myself? I changed my attitude. I looked at my father and his belly. I didn't want to end up being like him. And that made me do exercising everyday. Well not everyday because I sometimes miss it but that's fine. I checked what do successful people do and the most common thing was working out and reading. So that motivation that I later converted to my inspiration.

You hate reading books? I used to hate reading too. I started reading books in Feb this year. The first book (Think and Grow Rich) took me 28-30 days to finish. The next book I read was The Alchemist and I read it in less than 2 weeks. The reason? I enjoyed the book whereas in Think and Grow Rich, the author talked about things that didn't mattered to me that much. 

Then I started reading Sherlock Holmes but quit in middle because that book wasn't for me.

You wanna sleep early? I used to sleep around 1-2 am everyday and wake up at 9-10am. How did I changed that? I read the 5 AM Club by Robin Sharma. The book was good at some points where I read slowly and tried to understand everything but when it got boring I just skim over words. I finished the book in 10-13 days. I changed my attitude. I thought waking up early and going to sleep are kids stuff and I don't wanna do that. But that book gave me an inspiration to start sleeping early. I remember a quote from it which may inspire you too: ""Every change is hard at first, messy in the middle and glorious at the end"". 

Nowadays I automatically sleep around 9:30 PM. The first few days were terrible. I always thought why the fuck am I torturing myself. But I didn't gave up. After a week or two, my sleeping pattern changed and sleeping early become my new ""normal"". I sometimes snoozed my alarm and that's fine because your body doesn't want to change.

I think it's all about attitude. Well, how can you change that? Fuck motivation and find inspiration. My family inspired me to become responsible. My dad doesn't earn money, he is a gambler and he never paid for our (me and my sister's) study but I took it as an inspiration. I decided I don't want to end up becoming like him. And it inspired my everyday. I had an attitude of doing what others are doing and trying to impress them. But now, I just care about myself. I want to grow. I want to learn. 

TL;DR: Read books. Take inspiration and fuck motivation cause that shit doesn't last forever. You sleep late? Change your attitude. 

Action steps #1 Download Kindle or buy a Kindle. Don't read physical books because if you don't enjoy the story, you can't do anything about it. Get Kindle Unlimited and try different books until you find the one that interests you. Read one page a day and increase it gradually. Tip: Read short stories first. 

Action step #2 Put a timer for 5 minutes and start exercising. Can't exercise? No problem. Just wear your gym clothes. And 99% of the time, you will end up exercising more than you would have thought.

Action step #3 Read something 'boring' before sleeping. It helps. You will immediately start yawning and the next thing you know is that the next day has come. Or maybe do something tiring throughout the day. So you won't have energy to stay awake at night.

Bonus tip: Associate these tasks with something you enjoy. For me it was music. I exercise while listening to music. I read while listening to instrumentals. When I can't sleep, I listen to music. It may help you as well.

NonZeroDay,es7sybs,t3_c6cfk6,1561678977.0,"Learn to forgive yourself. I sometimes don't feel like doing my task. But as Ryan (the inspiration to this thread) said, you should just start it. No matter you finish it or not.

You didn't work those extra 2 hours? What were the reasons? You didn't feel like doing it or you wasted time on something else? Just forgive yourself. If you realized that you didn't finish the task. Start it now. Do it for as long as you can. Doesn't matter if it's for 1 minute or 2 minutes or whatever. It gives your brain a signal that you have done all of your tasks and feeling the sense of accomplishment, your brain will release some chemicals which will later help you NOT miss that task entirely. 

I have had these days when I didn't did what I planned. Yesterday, I didn't meditate for 15 minutes but when I got the opportunity, I did it for just 4 minutes and that was it. And now, I have got enough motivation to not miss my today's meditation session. Hope this helps."
