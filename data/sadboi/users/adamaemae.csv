People are so abrasive now a days too, they think they have the right to just be in our personal space so that they can pet the dog or test the dog and see if it will react to them. Thanks OP for this post! Hope you and everyone else on this sub is doing well with the covid-19 issues."

I've learned for me, the night sweats are less frequent when I smoke some weed before bed to calm me down and deter my subconscious from being too hypervigilant and to help reduce the nightmares. Maybe you could try that if it is possible for you at all. Hope some of this helps in any way. Stay frosty OP! :)"

CombatMedics,ff768kg,t3_erjugk,1579641934.0,"Run a lot more, that's a failing time for males and barely making the cut for females, and once you get to San Antonio, you will be doing A LOT of physical training after the first part of the course. Not to mention the hardest part of the first part of the course is NREMT. That's a computerized test that asks you questions medically and takes what you get wrong and asks you more questions about what you got wrong, questions can range from 70-120 questions in 2 hour max time and the test can cut off at any time the algorithm thinks it's done with seeing if you are competent on not. I suggest running a lot and also start rucking with weight to get used to it so that you dont stress your body and get shin splints during training. Also get used to carrying heavy people as you are pretty short, they will single you out and make you carry the big people. When I say carry I mean on a stretcher, or the different types of ways to carry a person e.g. firemans carry, etc. You're going to be constantly exhausted physically and mentally but all in all the training is great depending on which company you get. Some companies don't give a shit like the one my husband was assigned to and some are hard asses like my company. Goodluck OP :) if you need more info, feel free to DM me"

Dinnerly is just a cost effective brand and customer service is always on point if something in your box is messed up, they most likely always refund you or give you credit for your next box. I highly suggest Dinnerly or Hello Fresh to anyone who is tight on money and need easy meals to cook!"
