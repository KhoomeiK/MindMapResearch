I don‚Äôt think Harry ever thought of leaving as much as he may have wanted ‚Äúnormal‚Äù per se, but once he saw that MM and her media and public skills weren‚Äôt enough of a shield for the behind the scenes stuff I can see him agreeing to the suggestion to leave, esp if he thought they were going to get Sussex Royal and be family-adjacent.

Anecdotally, my high achieving ex suffered from gout, with a diet heavy in meat and drank 2 - 3 bottles of wine each day.

The ~~consul general~~  ambassador and political secretion head would not have allowed the cable to have been submitted if there were doubts about its veracity.

Today, cables are formatted emails and all the US embassies and consulates worldwide are constantly sending cables into Main State as part of the core foreign service role of information gathering and reporting.

People who suffered PTSD like trauma as kids tend to be like you are; also kids who were well taken care of in every way but emotionally (childhood emotional neglect) tend to be like you are too.

Or maybe she‚Äôs this way because no one helped her early on and she really thinks she‚Äôs being helpful but your ego prevents you from seeing her good albeit ham-handed intentions.

Just be decent to her and let her insecurities & personality that you don‚Äôt like wash away like water on a duck‚Äôs back. Unless she tries to take credit for your work, if that happens then the gloves can come off and you can slap her down."
Divorce,fa62f1r,t1_fa1nk10,1575820312.0,"The article you link to highlights other reasons than just ""baggage"" for second/third marriages not working out.  If we were all doomed to failure in second chances because of the emotional dreck we cart around with us, then new jobs, new careers, etc. wouldn't work out. 

The other reasons listed are:

1. divorce was an exit strategy once so it's easier to deploy it again
1. choosing the wrong person (which is both seeking out the same type of person you don't really get on with & the person you choose isn't honest about who they are until post-marriage)
1. the purpose of marriage (to raise children that does up the investment in the relationship)
1. time investment (in 2nd and 3rd marriages, less time has been invested making it easier to walk away)

And then not listed was random unknowns (which can dovetail with the broad umbrella of choosing the wrong person).  My second marriage is imploding because of this. Turns out my stbxh is a violent drunk and I didn't learn this until several years into the marriage.  I look back and I can see no signs that he would be this way, I see no red flags that I could have missed.  Either he didn't know he was this way either or he put up a good fake facade for several years.  At best I can see aspects of his personality that set him up to react in an authoritative my way or the highway manner to stress, but even still, that doesn't auto-imply drunken violence.  I think even he is surprised by it.

Not sure what I'm really saying here.  Otoh, I'm proving the statistics true but oto I don't think what happened has anything to do with my baggage or his."

slatestarcodex,f8v85r9,t3_e2bbi1,1574862591.0,"My background is economics, game theory and political science, so you can take my thoughts in this context.

**Mental mountains exist because of how very very useful they are more often than not.**
The term mental mountains to me is akin to heuristics, i.e. the mental models that allow our brains to take short cuts, so to recognize things and process them with minimal energy so we can pay attention to other things.  Think about those times you drove home from work on autopilot barely registering the drive, your brain expects it so you're free not to consciously notice it.  And then compare that to when something unexpected happens in the drive and you don't see it because you're brain wasn't expecting to see it.

Mental models/heuristics are also a sorting/coordination solution.  In the US, we expect everyone to drive on the right hand side of the road, we ourselves do it without applying any thought to the fact and we trust day in and day out that everyone else will too (so much so that when someone does try the other side, the mayhem that ensues invariably winds up in the news and you hear about it).

**Rational vs. irrational.**  I have a beef with behavioral economics because I think irrationality (as we describe it, a suboptimal outcome) is perfectly rational.  And this is because beliefs are part of making a rational decision.  If your beliefs are faulty (the effect of the so-called mental mountain) then that impacts what you perceive as rational in the moment, and hence you make perfectly rational decisions that look looney-tunes to the observer (e.g. the abused person staying with their abuser).

[As an aside, information is part of a rational decision, if you have imperfect information or asymmetric information, you can be led to a suboptimal outcome that feels rational as you make the choice.  In this instance, learning that say if someone gossips to you then they gossip about you as a rule of thumb, where it may not always be true but is so often true that the smarter choice is to assume it's true, is a heuristic that would create a mental mountain that again, does more good than harm.]

I didn't think the Richard speaking up example from a therapeutic perspective would work on me.  I am autistic so I actually work very well with being told ""the guys in the red shirts will always die"" and then ""the guys in the red shirts will always die, unless they don't join the away team down planet"" and adjusting perfectly for the new information.  Granted of course, I miss a whole host of other signals along the way, but my point is that Scott's critique of this therapeutic technique implied that you can't overcome someone's ingrained emotional response with merely telling them what is true today and my personal experience is that merely telling me what is true today works very very well to overcome an emotional response.  But then granted, despite the news telling you that autism is everywhere, the reality is I'm still an outlier messing up the data hewing to the line of theory.  I mention this only as a point of consideration on the off chance that perhaps there's another piece as to why some need more to put an old emotional response to bed than others do.

That said, the idea of using psychedelics to interrupt well-trod pathways in the brain to me sounds like a fantastic route of inquiry and I've been pleased to see it addressed both in academic circles and in the general media (and I'm including things like the Joe Rogan podcast in that pool).  There's even a facility in my town that treats depression with ketamine, no referral required, but oof it's pricey.  12 step groups note all of the time that overcoming addiction (which could include bad habits that are ingrained emotional responses) requires ""changing the tapes in one's head"" [dating myself to the Goofus & Gallant era by thinking in terms of cassette tapes lol].  That is, you have to consciously force the narrative change again and again and again until it sticks.  How long it takes is individual to the person, the only commonality is that it takes practice and it won't happen without conscious practice.  Have you ever seen a neuron in action? It's like a splatter of paint where each tentacle is desperately reaching out to communicate, so why wouldn't it grab the nearest hand that is always there?  Something has to force it to choose a different hand.  There's also some evidence that breaking the addiction cycle (where I'm making the assumption that any addiction is a reaction to hiding from an emotion) includes practicing self-care (getting enough sleep, making sure to brush your teeth every day, slowing down and breathing whenever anxiety ratchets up); I think the newfound popularity of meditation as treatment for depression/anxiety is getting at this aspect.

So for depression as as example, I think of it as it is always unhelpful to chase negative bunnies down dark twisty trails, nothing good ever comes from it.  And once I realize I'm doing that, I know rationally that nothing good comes from it, I consciously tell myself that my negative perception is likely not true, and repeating that has allowed me to move from having an negative outlook most of the time, to having a positive outlook that is peppered with occasional negative moments (trust me, I am a much more pleasant person to be around today, much more relaxed, and despite the pedantic way I express myself in writing, much more open and compassionate to others' journeys than in my early adulthood - in fact dare I say it, I'm more open in the way that a child is).

It makes me wonder, coping with my autism means I have become very attuned to grappling with my deep emotional condition (those emotions behind the surface one's that are expressed), so for someone like the Richard example, perhaps the disconnect is that he's not attuned to his deep emotional condition? It would make sense then that merely saying ""oh hey, look you have emotions behind the one of the shame that you feel that you can't speak up in meetings"" wouldn't produce much in the way of change.

tl:dr As always, just pondering aloud on my keyboard here, I could be wrong about all of this and if you bothered to read it all bless you."

slatestarcodex,f7dzgh0,t3_dvbh3e,1573638368.0,"I‚Äôm assuming this article was done in reaction to the replicability issue plaguing the social sciences and psychology in particular.  Asking why social scientists can be gullible is a much nicer way to phrase the question ‚Äúwhy do social scientists publish so much schlock and fervently believe it to be true?‚Äù

Still, it was an interesting read in light of the most recent SSC book review (The Body Keeps the Score) because one of Scott‚Äôs criticisms was how Kolk refused to acknowledge what we know about the links between genetics and mental issues and also how Kolk doesn‚Äôt have a good grasp on how the APA assesses information in order to have some sort of necessary systematized way to categorize symptoms. So that supports that gullibility is associated with bad data and hewing to an outcome agenda.

Otoh Kolk is onto something with his everything and the kitchen sink approach to treating PTSD caused by childhood trauma. It makes me wonder if there is a certain amount of refusing to accept what‚Äôs known (in a crazy denial kind of way instead of a mere challenging the paradigm way) that is a necessary condition to posit and pursue outlandish theories that turn out to be true too and would otherwise be overlooked.

ArmchairExpert,f7b6z9e,t3_duw5wd,1573558919.0,"ArmchairExpert is now successful enough that it's part of the podcast tour anyone promoting something goes on. This is why Dax, Sam Harris, Joe Rogan and so on tend to have the same high profile guests at the same time.  The cannibalization is sometimes good, sometimes frustrating because at some point, I can't be interested in listening to another hour of Ed Norton even if I like him.  When this happens, I generally pick one host and skip the rest.

Anyhoo, publicity tours come with stipulations and agendas because the conversation needs to highlight the entire reason the person agreed to be on the podcast in the first place.

But idk about the tour through life perspective as a standard, it's interesting when it's someone like Justin Long who I knew nothing about versus maybe not so much when it's someone who I already know their story more or less because of how famous they are.

slatestarcodex,f6i0plv,t1_f6hs3yg,1572869609.0,"That's interesting that you say ""countries where street politics are taken more seriously.""  I've always thought that protests and rallies as such are only useful to achieving action by a government when it's the only way for a specific group to be heard or a specific political point to be made.  

The US for all that may ail it at times, has so many routes for civic engagement and to have your voice heard, that protests here have little meaning (beyond what everyone is noting, it's a solidarity moment).  The times protests have worked here (e.g. the Civil Rights Era, Shays' Rebellion) were when only through such actions did government recognize that it *had* to act, and only through the route of protest could that group have any political agency; compare that to say the Women's March in DC a few years ago that did nothing in terms of changing government policy about anything because women have an incredible variety of routes to be heard politically.

I do think that rallies and parades can play a role in cultural acceptance, e.g. gay pride parades that helped the nation see that a small percentage of the population is still quite large, but the real achievement of shifting US culture to accept homosexuality as part of the norm occurred because gay people took advantage of all the routes to civic engagement and having your voice heard that we have in the US. 

I don't mean to discount the value of feeling part of a larger group, after all, no matter how asocial any of us may be, most of us enjoy knowing that we are part of something bigger than just ourselves.  In terms of civic engagement that is nothing to sneeze at because it can motivate people to then turn to concrete actions in their own communities to effect change/support those issues that they care about.  I'm turning this question over in my mind as I'm typing, so I think that's where I'm netting out on this question: political rallies are valuable as a motivation point to encourage people to pursue civic engagement opportunities in their own communities and recognize that that is how they can be part of the political process beyond merely voting.

I've never been to a political rally by a major political candidate, but if the opportunity arose I would go, I think it'd be a cool experience."

slatestarcodex,f60vl0s,t3_dq3pa5,1572627027.0,"Hollywood is a formula seeking business. Movies are incredibly expensive to make with a lot of moving parts that makes coordinating the actual making of it difficult, so anything a studio can do to ensure ease of coordination and a return, it will do. Thus it will leave theoretical money on the table in favor of the sure bet *even if* the sure bet dollar amount is lower (bc duh, the theoretical money could be larger but most likely will be smaller given unknowns are a hard sell to moviegoers).  An actor who gets a franchise movie is making the same calculations (because no matter how famous an actor is, he can go from known to whatever happened to .... overnight). A power producer or writer can face the same fate if their expensive to produce movie bombs, so they are making the same decision calculus. A successful franchise means consistent profit and all that flows from that for everyone involved so a studio/producer/actor etc. will not abandon a franchise until it demonstrably fails.

In contrast moviegoers are only demonstrating their preferences among available supply.  How big would the movie going population be if there were a greater variety of genres produced? We‚Äôll never know because meeting all of the genre wants is a much riskier path with too much fluctuations in profit (and as noted earlier, fluctuations in profit can kill Hollywood careers so it‚Äôs not worth the risk).

Thus imho the comic book movie franchise is a solution only in so far as it‚Äôs a franchise and Hollywood knows franchises work. It will stop at some point and be replaced by a different franchise in the future, the only open question is when, not if.

For those of you thinking that the Marvel franchise is somehow different, imho you are displaying the effects of prospect theory; you think it‚Äôs different because you are emotionally invested in/delighted by this franchise in some way.

Ask_Politics,f5fgd8q,t1_f5cu676,1572182234.0,"In support of your point but with a bit more texture, just now I went to both Wapo's and NYT's US sites.  Neither have anything about Chile on their homepages; NYT has one article about Hong Kong.  If you click on World, Wapo has one article about Chile, and the NYT has 2 about Hong Kong, nothing about Chile.

So yes, they cover world news, but their US sites are very US-centric meaning that to get so-called world news (that doesn't directly involve a US action like say Syria), a US user has to be looking for it because they care about it.  What's on these sites' homepages shows what their news to push interests are.  

For grins, I checked Google News.  The main feed had nothing on Chile, I had to click on world and scroll (past an article on Rachel Maddow???) to find it.  Yahoo News is more obvious about how it's pulling from my location because local to me stories appeared both on the homepage and when I clicked on the world feed, but there was nada on Hong Kong or Chile.

This was all done on my laptop.  The smartnews app on my phone has both Hong Kong and Chile in the world feed, but not in top news (although that is probably displaying the results of my preferences over time).

Personally, I've been very aware of what's happening in Hong Kong and Chile because I don't rely on news aggregators; I have an old school read all the papers approach to how I consume news and I visit a bunch of news sites and quasi-academic blogs daily. 

I think there's a difference in the current events awareness of someone who is passive about how they find out about news (they wait for it to come to them) versus someone who is intrinsically interested and is directly visiting news sites because staying abreast of what's going on in the world is important to them.  No shame on the former group because to each their own (there are certainly things I'm ignoring that are likely quite valuable to have or know after all), but I don't think you'll find anyone in the latter group saying they didn't know about the protests in Chile or complaining about stories not being reported about."

Sometimes he misses the point and succumbs to explaining your feelings to you like he's doing now.  He's not wrong per se, but what he's saying is not in any way helpful to the issue/problem you've posited.

Here's what's going on.  You have unprocessed aka not understood feelings around an event that is typically seen as trivial/not a big deal in real terms.  It is especially seen as trivial/not a big deal by those who are clear on their boundaries and feelings.  When you aren't, when you are still struggling to figure that shit out, you will find yourself going over and over and over an interaction with a guy/person that is still very present in your mind because the cognitive dissonance between what you thought was happening and what actually happened is screaming at you.  Sure, it's not the trauma of rape. Sure, it's not the trauma of a real relationship imploding.  But fuck that, it's a type of trauma to you because YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED and you talk about it again and again because you are trying to understand. 

That is what therapy is for.  To understand.  Yourself foremost, but others too.  So it's imho f*cking trite to say oh it's not society when in fact it is your entire world that is telling you that this thing you ruminate about is a nothing.  And it's society because come on, you're in your 30s, you're supposed to have this shit figured out!  Well maybe, but not if say ... like in my case it turns out you have autism that explains so much about how for sure most neurotypical people wouldn't respond like I did ... or if you grew up in a severely emotionally neglectful home as a child (i.e. you got all of the material stuff but none of the emotional stuff) and have been careening around trying to figure out why you react so differently from others ... or whatever is unique to you that has put you behind the 8 ball a bit later in life than is seen as ""typical"" or ""normal"".

So what you want is your therapist to acknowledge this.  To acknowledge why this thing that is trivial is not in your head.  Why you hear the same message about this supposed trivial (but not!) thing from everyone you know.  You've already thought to yourself, ok, well everyone disagrees with me so it must be me, but WHY?  Society tells me I'm wrong (books, movies, news stories, friends) so why am I still suffering? Why does everyone tell me it's nothing when it feels like a huge f*cking something?

My .02 is you need to go therapist shopping to find one who can see that just because perhaps you are stuck on something that isn't earth shattering doesn't mean it's not a worthy topic of exploration to help you move forward.  And as well one that will work on the black and white thinking of ""society vs. me"" that is both real and not real at the same time."

While it's true you can hunt with certain types of handguns, if NICS sees a foreign national with a hunting license trying to buy a G20, they are going to deny it.  I suppose you could try to get a revolver that way but I still think it'd be denied because long guns are standard hunting firearms and handguns have a more commonly associated use.  Since you don't get arrested for being denied by NICS, if the OP wants to try this to see what happens, it'd be interesting to find out.  Still, my guess is that in TX, NM, AZ and CA, he'd get denied.

Re: temporary foreign worker, this classification is for time-limited of short duration.  It brings to mind agricultural worker visas that are valid for 3 or 4 months.  It doesn't mean someone with a work visa.  The TN part is the part that likely hasn't ever been adjudicated against the language ""temporary"" which is why I said it probably would work, but if someone came looking it might not, i.e. don't give anyone a reason to come looking and it should be fine.

Re: does he have a visa.  This is a semantics argument and ATF language is covering both interpretations.  He does have a visa, he just didn't have to interview to get the visa, he got it automatically by virtue of his nationality.

I‚Äôm a former US Vice Consul (so I interviewed visa applicants outside the US) i.e. I worked for State. I've also worked at a border post, so I understand how CBP defines it, and I am married to a FFL so I understand gun laws and how the ATF looks at things.

And therein lies the reason you find this issue impenetrable, it involves not just the law but 3 different agencies (4 including the FBI actually) and they interpret the law differently depending upon their mandate. Also, here's the thing about US law and the intersection of it with various agencies: when it comes to interpretation, it's the totality of circumstances that ladder up to what the law says, not just the strict interpretation of the law. 

You've posted a lot to respond to, made a lot of incorrect assumptions, and confused yourself as to who is responsible for what, so I'll make some specific comments on what jumped out at me, but ask me about any specifics if you're curious on my take.

*Defintion Confusion:*
Immigrant intent has no concrete definition (and woe to the applicant/entrant who believes a lawyer can tell you). The definition is what I think it is in the moment when I‚Äôm interviewing you. Do I think you‚Äôll go home before or when your visa expires? That depends on what kind of visa you want, your nationality, your age, your sex, your reason for travel that day etc. and the typical fraud pattern for your nationality in comparison to how all the data I'm taking in while speaking with you compares to that.  This is why defining immigrant intent can't be written down into a list of dos and don'ts. It is also why you'll get variability when entering from CBP - they are making the same decision calculus that I would have made in a visa interview mediated by their own agency's perspective on granting entry.  So a photocopy of a document can be ok one day and then not the next because that official is thinking ""maybe when my fellow officer let this slide, he created a window of opportunity for fraud and it'd be a good thing to double check that.""  You can't know all that goes into the decision because no one, not even me, is going to help you game the system.  (That said, there are some jerks that work at CBP that really sometimes are just jerks because they can be; the equivalent at State is the young officer who has so little life experience that they make weird judgment calls about things that those of us with life experience know are just wrong.)

The Visa Waiver Program is a program by the US State Department where people from certain nations can enter the US on a tourist visa for 6 months without applying in advance for a visa (i.e. having an interview with State); they still have to meet entry terms and be inspected/interviewed by CBP at the border.  CBP at that point can deny entry.  Citizens of countries who are not part of the Visa Waiver Program HAVE to get a visa (i.e. be interviewed by State first).  Both groups look effectively the same at entry in so far as they show up on the same plane and go through the same point of entry, fill out the same I-94, and can be granted or denied entry by CBP.  All a visa is, is a document from the State Department that gives you permission to approach a US port of entry and ask CBP to let you in.  Visa Waiver Program country residents can skip that step and are allowed without a visa to approach a US port of entry and ask CBP to let them in.  The reason you found both categories addressed by the ATF memo is that they are two separate legal categories. That ATF memo is telling you that if you entered under the Visa Waiver Program you can buy a firearm ""without a visa"" because if you entered under that program, then you did enter without a visa.  Because Canada is a Visa Waiver Program member country, you are allowed to skip getting an interview with State and can approach the border and ask CBP to allow you entry with TN Status (which means you can enter for 3 years and work, instead of just for 6 months (compared to Mexico which is not a Visa Waiver Program country so they have to get a TN Visa from State first).  

*Staying/Living in a Home with a Gun:*
No ATF or local LEO is going to arrest you because you have a TN visa and your GF owns a firearm and keeps in the house where you live.  Constructive possession is meant to address felons and those convicted of domestic violence.  Because these two groups usually cannot own a firearm, if the person they live with does, then yes, the ATF or local LEO will assume ill-intent/possession IF they have another interest in the person.  Neither has enough time to go around looking for situations where this is occurring.  But if they've drawn a bead on you because they suspect you of something, then this aspect will aid them in getting to you.  For example (fudging some details so you can't ID the person place), a guy and his GF came in to buy a gun.  From every aspect of the purchase, it was clear that the GF was the buyer.  She asked the questions, she explained her preferences, she handled the firearm, she made the firearm purchase choice.  The guy was there and gave her the money.  It wasn't a straw purchase because she was the buyer, she completed the 4473, the money was the gift not the gun.  Great. So far so good. But the guy had been convicted of domestic violence in the last year (turns out she had been the victim in that incident) AND local LEOs thought he had skated on a murder charge because a few years or so prior, he had killed someone in a home invasion robbery.  Add into the mix, this guy is well known in the area for the sport he practiced, so quasi-famous, maybe a bit more so if you like his particular sport. So the LEOs thought this guy had intentionally murdered someone but because of his ""fame"" and lack of evidence, he was not prosecuted.  Another customer that day was a retired LEO, recognized the guy, reached out to his buddies, and they started nosing around because now they knew this guy was living in a home with a firearm when he was not allowed to own one.  That nosing around led to their finding a social media post of him holding the firearm at a shooting range, and add in his coming back to the store to pick up an accessory for the firearm, led to his arrest.  THAT's what constructive possession looks like.

*Non-immigrant Visa Holders and Hunting Licenses:*
Hunting is rifles, not pistols.  Your background check will be denied if you try to buy a pistol. The way this one will be interpreted by the ATF and local LEOs is ""did you enter the US with the intent to go hunting"" and ""what type of rifle did you buy""?   If you buy a firearm for hunting and then do something else with it, that will trip you up.  Note how these interpretative questions come after the fact, it is immaterial in terms of making the purchase. You will only face this if you do something stupid with your rifle and have the ATF or local LEOs coming to look for you on the basis of your stupid act.  The Chinese students in Arizona were prosecuted for fraudulently obtaining a hunting license, not for the fact of their gun purchase.  Somebody noted the Chinese names, that made them look at the details, the details were clearly fraudulent, and that led to their interview and arrest.

All in all, yes you can live in a home where another occupant is a gun owner and not be violating the law.  Yes, you can get a hunting license and buy a rifle (i.e. a long gun) but not a handgun because you are from a visa waiver program country and your TN status classifies you as a ""temporary foreign worker"" (see 12d on the 4473). However, that you are in the US on TN status does open you up to a risk if you somehow do something stupid with your rifle because the ATF has not defined what it means by ""temporary foreign worker"" on the 4473 because they could try to argue that three years does not constitute temporary (the lesson here is don't do something stupid and ruin it for yourself and all the other Canadian TNs). You will need a copy of your I-94 to make a purchase AND you will initially be delayed on your background check so you won't be able to buy a hunting rifle and walk out of the store on the same day (i.e. someone will actually look at your information). (Also fyi, background checks are done by yet another agency, the FBI)."

slatestarcodex,ezpob4k,t3_d1p01b,1568044744.0,"These examples are also examples of how all public policy creates negative externalities and incentivizes basic rent seeking. While you can solve a problem with a new law, at the exact same time the pool of winners and losers is redefined so that any new law will also create a new problem for a different subset of people.  So is the fact of a negative externality and/or use of the policy for selfish gains proof of subterfuge?

Thus I'm not sure how much covert intent there really is in this. Per the Austrian example mentioned by u/hateradio, the secondary intent seems meant overtly, if you think banning one group you don't like is ok then you think banning any group is ok, and you like the idea of putting all groups on notice that they are beholden to your opinion of what's ok and what isn't. This isn't seen as problematic because you think you are right and therefore they should trust your judgment because you have their best interests at heart.

But whether overt or covert, I like the descripter a ""trojan horse policy"" that others mentioned in cases where there is an obvious immediate second outcome despite it not being the stated intent."
