i could help you figure out basic needs that cats have if you want to :)"

MDMA,fc5h4z5,t1_fc5giwi,1577457447.0,"everybody's brain is different and therefore drugs will affect different people in many ways. i guess my serotonin tanks (i don't know how to say it scientifically in english sry) weren't filled all the way, and it's not that i don't feel good when i take it, it's more like the comedown isn't worth like 1 and a half hours of fun"
MDMA,fc5ab8a,t1_fc4thaq,1577450860.0,"me too :( 
i wish i had followed the advice, cause i did my research and still here i am, havent taken anything in a year or two and the magic aint coming back"
MDMA,fbtkydo,t3_ee9b5f,1577082904.0,"hello! i hope you're doing fine, your story is kinda like mine. i've recovered and started to enjoy life in many ways too"
MDMA,fbgso2z,t1_fbglvbk,1576857669.0,"well maybe if your life is already perfect and you had a perfect childhood or you are just an amazingly strong person you can roll just about every weekend and not feel a thing. either way neurotoxicity is real, and i have had friends who haven't beem affected by drugs for 10 years, but they haven't achieved anything either. most of them sell drugs to do drugs and get by. some of them go to jail, others don't have a home. 

i love drugs, i think if you make good use of them they can be wonderful and not have any terrible side effects, but you have to do your research and stay safe! 

i don't want to grow old, but since we have to anyway i would rather get to that stage as helthy as i can, at least with a right mind"
MDMA,fbgqxdt,t3_eda89q,1576856520.0,"i posted something similar here a few years ago. i didn't get many kind responses, most people here will tell you you are damaging your brain, body etc. 

honestly they are right, i stopped taking molly and let me tell you a silky road to being sober doesnt exist. it will be really hard at times, and since you are not really experiencing any horrible side effect you most likely won't come to terms with quitting for a while until you get them. you will get them eventually, and maybe you dont even realise as you also said. i didnt at first but it didn't take too long for me to notice i was worse than ever and it wasnt because my family was shitty or my life was miserable, it was mostly drugs and mental health issues i had beforehand.

so yeah, i think i didnt taste a drop of mdma in pills or rocks in 2 years probably. i do smoke marihuana or hashish daily, also from time to time i like to maybe go for 2 lines or a little more of speed. the recovery with speed alone (also mixed with alcohol is fun but dont overdo any of them) is amazing because you may lose some sleep but you know just smoke joints until you start to get sleepy hahah

i really hope you take my advice into consideration and just know that many drugs exist if you really cant live sober like myself"

MDMA,ew1pipk,t3_cm8lh7,1565028548.0,"i dont know if i can help you, but i live a similar situation with my mom, and im sure you mom loves you. you just need to understand why she's like this. maybe her family didnt treat herthe way she wnted to be treated or has had an incident that evolved into this.buthonestly yo can become so much better than her if you just let things be. 
i know its really hard, but understanding why someine is behaving a certain way can help you grow as a person. 
im dont think im getting the point across,and it could be that your mum is plain evil, but most people just werent given the chance as you also werent. so just try and accept your past, know that it may have had an impact onyou but with the help from a therapist (if u have the money) or even by yourself with some time you may be able to turn things around. but you have to really want to become a better person.
anyways i hope i helped to some extent and you can reach out to me whenever you feel like it. good luck in life"
