That's how I decreased the amount of cigs I smoke, at least. Hopefully someone else will provide a more useful answer, but regardless, good luck bro 🙏"

ptsd,ezja33n,t1_ezf83fn,1567941265.0,"It's ok to feel that, but you're not weak, and it's not your fault that you react to abusive behaviour. It's perfectly reasonable. You aren't the reason she feels this way, and she's in the wrong for treating you like this. You aren't denying her pain by acknowledging your own.

Your story hits really close to home for me, because I've also acted badly (although thankfully not as badly as her) to my boyfriend, and I've finally actually started dealing with it. We've decided to live apart for a short while right now, which obviously sucks, but I am so grateful he told me (not to say that she definitely will, but still). It's been pretty hard for me to accept that I've acted badly to him, because you get so caught up in yourself that you don't really notice or choose to disregard how your behaviour is hurting the person closest to you. If he hadn't told me the seriousness of it, I would just have continued justifying my behaviour and our relationship would probably have eventually failed.

But to repeat something another comment said, she does seem to have something else going on too, considering how abusive she is being. She might just be abusive in ways unrelated to unintentional shitty abuse that can happen because of PTSD, but I hope she can change. Otherwise, you should consider leaving. Abusive is never ok, no matter the cause.

I really hope things get better for you."
ptsd,ezcmep8,t3_d0qqx1,1567837242.0,"I can imagine it can be really hard for you, and I'm sorry you both have to go through this. Based on the experiences of my partner, I can assure you your struggles are not unusual. I know you care for her and want her to feel safe and happy, but in order for both her and you to move forward you need to set boundaries. Make sure you tell her she needs to seek out professional help in order for your relationship to work. It can be hard for a person suffering to face up to the facts that their struggles negatively impact the people close to them, and she might feel it's unfair, but it's necessary. You need to care for yourself too, and it won't help her for you to just put up with it as it is. You have to try to set boundaries, and make sure she knows she's acting out her problems on you. Trust me, it's necessary for the both of you. Admit to yourself that it hurts you, and remind yourself to not feel ashamed because of that. And let her know how her actions affect you, and that she needs professional help. No matter how bad she feels, it's not ok to take it out on you like that.

Good luck, and take care <3

(and sorry for the long post)"
ptsd,ewzyo5i,t3_cqunat,1565902532.0,"I'm so so sorry this happened to you. I know how hard it can be to tell something like this to your parents, I still haven't. It's especially hard since they know about one of the things that gives me PTSD (a kidnapping), but not the rapes. I'm trying to build up strength to tell my mom, but it's hard.

Considering how bad it's gotten for you I'd try to tell him as soon as possible. As you said, it's never a right time. I'm not sure what you should do either, it's really all up to you. My guess is that him and your mom are already pretty rattled from your almost- suicide attempt, so telling him as soon as possible is probably for the best. It might get harder the longer you wait. But then again, I don't know your situation, and it's ultimately up to you. <3

I hope you feel better soon, glad you're still here <3"
