When employees want to use their ID badge as payment, their available balance is shown on the bottom of the receipt (which is what‚Äôs left of their next paycheck). Btw, we would get payed every Friday. One time the store manager came by to just get a candy bar, and I took a quick peak at that part of the receipt.... it was at least $18,000. My eyes nearly popped out of my head. Especially because he didn‚Äôt know how to do anything. Didn‚Äôt know how to use the register, the gate, the intercom, the radio, the store procedures, the return policies, anything.... and one employee told me that managers receive a 10% raise each year. No idea if that‚Äôs true... but if so.... just howwhywhatdafuck. Meanwhile I was a full time student working two jobs creating commissioned art on the side.

The son is in a room and you can see the mom clinging to the corner of the ceiling. Then the jump scare for me is now a different angle of the son looking around, then you see the mom running in mid-air out of the room behind him. No sound. But it freaks the living shit out of me."

But even the Simpsons Treehouse of Horror episode would scare me shitless. The first few movies I saw in elementary school that freaked me the fuck out were Jaws, Psycho, Signs, and The Shining (all between ages 7 and 13). Then I saw The Exorcism of Emily Rose when I just turned 15 and I was too afraid to get off the couch (the movie ended at 3:15am, and the whole paranormal activity around 3am is huge in that movie). That Halloween, I watched The Exorcist for the first time and then The Blair Witch Project (which I still thought was real footage while watching it). Since those two movies, I feel like I had finally desensitized myself enough to not be freaked out by ANY horror movie. It was a process but rarely any horror movie genuinely terrifies me. Two exceptions: 1) the clown doll in Poltergeist, and 2) all of Hereditary."
