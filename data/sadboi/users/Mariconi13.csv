My babysister was born premature and my mom was supposed to be due for another 1 or 2 months. It didn't felt like deja vu but I did have another dream where I did get that feeling when i was awake. Its quite funny. Its about target.. i used to work there lol and I dreamed of waking up super late for my shift. I remember the time was specifically 9:45am when I arrived. I was begging for forgiveness and then I woke up. Luckily it didn't happen to me but when I was at work my coworker arrived supper late and exactly at 9:45am and said the same thing i did in the dream she begged for forgiveness. It was trippy because I bearly knew her too and why would of dream of that.

dating_advice,fmvf0k3,t3_fxklov,1586414720.0,I am kind of in a similar situation. I'm just a year older than you. I don't have the best love life either. Only had 2 very short relationships (not serious) I realized I'm scared of commitment. So been single for a long time because of it. I get frustrated too when I see other friends or relatives in relationships when they are just as damaged or more than me and wonder why can't I find the right guy. I know I'm not perfect but most people don't find their future partner at their best either. So I think its not a problem you have. You seem confident in what you want and know your self. I think its the people you meet. And maybe not duell on the thought you are a problem. It might lead you to give out that vibe or worst and believe it. Have you tried meeting people from a different city?

Dreams,fl210rl,t3_fm37o4,1584740539.0,"To dream of your clothes is symbolic of your public self and how you are perceived. It is indicative of the act you put on in front of others. Clothes are also an indication of your condition and status in life.  Thus, if you wear clothes that do not suit you or that you normally would not wear, then it suggests that you are putting up a front and trying to deceive others. Something in your life is ""unsuitable"". It may be a symbol of hypocrisy and being someone that you are not. Alternatively, it could also mean that you are revealing a hidden part of yourself to the world.

To dream that you are wearing only black clothes refer to your desires to blend in. You may be representing your shadow persona and expressing your subconscious thoughts. If you normally wear black clothes in your waking life, then the dream may simply be a reflection of yourself.

I do genuinely think you will get those days where you have a relaxed day and wake up happy again. It will take time and it won't be easy.

My parents and family members were drinking and I felt like that day wasn't really to celebrate my birthday but to party and get drunk. I have always felt this deep loneliness and sadness as a kid even though I had a lot of family members around me all the time. On my birthday I just felt more alone than usual. I didn't want to feel anything anymore and was debating on jumping off. I was getting closer to the edge. Looking down to the ground full of plants. Asking myself is this it..Then luckily my cousin went up to the roof looking for my sister. It was dark so he couldn't tell if I was crying. He asked and I said I don't know, she might be in the room. I quickly backed up from the edge and he left. I got scared from him coming out of nowhere. I realized if I were to do it. One of my younger cousins could come and see and be traumatized from it. I then started to think how my death would affect my family. I decided not to do it. I told myself no. I went back down and tried to shrug it off. I still feel this wave of sadness/loneliness on my birthdays but I am glad I am still alive."

My mom is a very intuitive person and animals always love her or are very comfortable with her and same with people.  She can tell when someone is bad or going to do harm. She sometimes predicts stuff. She says it's her gut or knowing. Like an instinct. My younger sister is the same. She can tell when something bad is going to happen not too specifically. She is always right on people too like if they give off a good vibe or not. I am a little intuitive but more of an empath. I can feel people's emotions as mine. Sometimes it confuses me and can't exactly listen to my intuition. Anyways take advantage of your ability to heal others and guide too.
WomensHealth,fiwiiz8,t3_fa0wk6,1582787327.0,How about look at your vulva and get to know where your clit is. If you are comfortable with knowing your vulva is it might be easier to masterbate. That's how I started. Then start to where clothes that turn you on like lingerie or think about someone who does turn you on. Put music on that get you in the mood. Even erotic foreplay might help. Porn can help too. Go into it slowly and touch gently in the beginning. Reassure yourself this is pleasure and your own body. You are aloud to pleasure yourself anyway you want. Then with time you will know what feels good and start to orgasm.

Sleep with a loose braid or bun to prevent split ends. 
If you shower every day just use conditioner if hair isnt oily.
If you do use heat on your hair use oil before and after if it looks dry. And use that heat style for as long as you can. Make it last for 4 days. 
Try heatless hairstyles or heatless curls.
Silk pillowcase also helps with less frizz and split ends.

If you can still have your service for longer. Than I would do it all online. What carrier do you have? I know boost will let you have service after a week without paying. If you can't I would just do it in store. They still have pretty good deals too."
CricketWireless,f8pavvt,t3_e1hwcc,1574698519.0,"Well the price will be different in store but you'll have the phones arleady. So it depends if you want the phones right away or don't mind waiting online. I know that if you wait you will still have service from your other carrier til you activate the phone once it arrives. I think it takes up for a week for shipping but I might be wrong. 

If you want to save money I would just do it online, but if you want the phones right away then go in store."

AskAstrologers,f7nadq4,t3_dwtxv6,1573892055.0,"Omg I do this too!! I got a pisces moon with sun, Neptune, and Jupiter sextiling it. I either create a ""music video"" that goes with the song from my life experience or from movie scenes or imagine one up. When I hear old songs I remember exactly how I felt in that moment and the whole scene I created in my head for it. I tend to keep track of time/history with the songs I listen to. I can only remember important events in my life with music.  By the way I have a capricorn sun. Scorpio rising too"
AskAstrologers,f7kamy3,t3_dwd9op,1573800800.0,"I usually write and cry while lstening to music. If I feel like I can't . I either exercise or go on long runs/walks, listening to music.. Now that I think about  it hearing music helps me just escape or go into my feelings more if i need too. I tend to bottle up my emotions (sadness or anger) away, so music helps to reopen them up  again. I got lots of capricorn in my chart..I pray too if I keep stressing too."

I mean you got Keanu Reeves, Mother Teresa, Johann Goethe, Beyonce, my sister Martha and many more sharing the same star sign! You guys have such a deep heart and are our little heroes. You guys keep us (other astro signs) on track."

drivinganxiety,f4vedxl,t3_dlgqhz,1571841153.0,I get the same feeling and that's why i try not to drive. The fear of crashing and being out of control is too much. My dad always tells me its so simple to drive but he has been doing this since he was 14. He lived in Mexico and has had his accidents. He learned to drive early to help his parents and to get his job so that fear went away quickly. It was more of a need for him to survive. My case is that I am able to get a ride anywhere I go so it isnt as important and my fear also gives me an excuse to not want to drive.

science,f425mnt,t3_dj4z87,1571327752.0,"I think it's been harder to really connect with each other. Weather its with family or withourselves or others. It's so easy to loose yourself with meaningless things like watching Netflix or your phone instead of having a meaningful or deep conversation with the person next to you or in the other room/house. We don't socialize like we use to. We became lazy in having deeper connections with the people around us. We connect with strangers who bearly knows us. Social infuencers, YouTubers, Celebrities, and people we don't see face to face. The people around us are either the same in loosing themselves with social media, television, work, or other activities that loose your time to really spend getting to know eachother."
hangover,f2uwx0b,t3_cyzofs,1570433247.0,"Yes. It might have been from not eating before drinking. I usually sleep it off even if it takes all day and not eating at all if I'm nauseous. I hate vomiting so I don't even risk it but if you are hungry. You can try to eat banana or bread if its been more than 3 hours since your last vomit. I also have been getting horrible hangovers too this year. I think its because I am getting older and because  I mix my alcohol. Like I would sometimes drink tequila, vodka, beer, and whiskey all in a few rounds and smoke weed too. So now I'm sticking to one and now I don't get huge hangovers as much."
