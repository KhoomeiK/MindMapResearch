Didn't help I was a hot headed kid used to fighting anything and everything that came my way.
Now, I'm homeless again. Tried not to let this happen again but c'est la vie. Thankfully now, I don't always have to sleep outside. I've got friends that let me couch surf and a boyfriend who will let me come at anytime of night. Do I enjoy my life? No, but it's better then last time at least."

First step for me, was admitting it to my boyfriend. Admitting the shame and the fact that it was a chore for me.

Next thing for me, was just having an orgasm. I'd never had one before, I'd faked them with everyone I had been with. Lucky for me I was dating Mr Magic Tongue. But it still took a few weeks before I was able to. It took me stopping him anytime I felt like I was dissociating, everytime I felt bad for asking him to do this, Everytime I wasn't in the mood anymore. Be vocal. We weren't given the option to be vocal in our first times so it'll take some work. But be vocal about what feels good, what doesn't, what hurts, and when you just don't want to, which was the hardest part for me.

After that, we came up with a system. He'd eat me out till I'd had an orgasm, then he'd make sure I was still in the mood and we'd try to have sex. There were some days I struggled to just stay in the mood, so we'd stop, and there were some days just his eyes would keep me right where I was. 

It took a while. I dated the guy for a year and there were still days I just couldn't do anything. Unfortunately, my inability to fully please him lead to the end of our relationship. But i have found someone else just as good and if he leaves, I will find someone else. 

I am still trying to not feel shame. I still feel it and it's been 3 years now since I acknowledged the problem and started fixing it. I can't give many pointers there. But I enjoy sex now. It's a start."

So I started just dumping my food in my locker before I left so my friends wouldn't see me throwing away the food. Flash forward a few months and my locker smells to high heaven. A janitor reported me and the led to my grandmother getting called to school. By that point I had stopped using my locker at all and just threw everything away the moment I got to school. I didn't know that my locker smelled. But sure enough when they opened my locker, everything had molded and my grandmother finally realized how bad my ED had gotten.

I love my bushy brows and don't midn them thick. But sometimes girls will over wax making them thin and a weird angle in the tail.
