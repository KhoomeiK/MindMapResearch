I haven't been left alone for a very long time and I avoid this like the plague but something important to remember is that monophobia is an extension of agoraphobia so if you work on and process some of your agoraphobia, the monophobia will lessen.   


As for coping, if you have any animals, keep them close, do you have any neighbors that you're friends with that will be home? Take comfort in the fact that there are people around - even if they're not the exact people that you need - if serious shit went down you would not be alone. 

  
Podcasts are good to listen to while you're trying to fall asleep - preferably something engaging enough to keep your attention but boring enough to allow you to fall asleep, I listen to history podcasts but here's some suggestions:  
The Moth   
Myths and Legends  
Nocturne  
Philosophize this   
Sleep With Me (designed especially for this)  
Snoozecast  


A radio or TV on in the background can be just as useful, depending on the kind of person that you are.  


Cuddle a teddy, light some incense, make yourself cups of tea and try your best to maybe even enjoy a little time alone, but if all you can do is survive then that's more than enough. <3

He's probably trying to avoid that and trust me, it's best for both of you if he does.   
What you're doing right now is perfect, there's a fine line between helping your partner and enabling his mental illness so it's important to keep that balance in check, for example, you guys need to go to the supermarket, assuming he's not having a terrible day, encourage him to come with you, going for him all the time will just lead him to depend on you for that certain activity and make his comfort zone smaller, that's just an example though.   
The big thing with agoraphobia, is it is literally a fear of anxiety, do not forget this.   
Encourage him when he's struggling, applaud him when he's smashing goals and making progress and NEVER yell at him during a panic attack.
