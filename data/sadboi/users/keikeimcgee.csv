I suffer from mental illness (bipolar 2). We kept my daughter home for 5 weeks. Daycare didn’t close in my state but we choose to keep her home. We both worked from home while taking care of her. While my husband is great his work is intense and he focuses and gets stuck in concentration a lot, so most the childcare fell on me while also leading a huge project with a mid sized team. I was on the verge of an episode. We made the tough choice to send her back to daycare. Cases are down and they’re taking extra precautions. She’s been back three weeks now and honestly it’s been great. We’re all happy and healthy and doing great. It was what we needed to do for our family. 

It takes courage to recognize you need help. You did the right thing. Virtual hugs"
