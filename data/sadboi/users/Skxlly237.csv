Doesn’t matter how big of an issue it is because to me pain is pain. Everyone needs to give off that love frequency and be connected within themselves. We’re all one at the end of the day, spiritual beings."
socialskills,fqg5xt5,t1_fqg0h06,1589338678.0,It really is common sense thats how sad it is for me to barely be learning how to communicate better. Ay at least I’m improving everyday. I used to always talk and just love to make people happy tho but due to some circumstances in my life I just totally isolated myself and didnt really care anymore about anything.
depression,fqg5ogu,t1_fqf4r4k,1589338520.0,Haha same here man. Im like “yeah I guess some of us just been through shit earlier in our lives” but they take it as a joke sometimes. I understand cause people don’t really like hearing negative things. But for me I like helping people and understanding them. I know im a good person but sometimes I say to myself if its a bad habit because nobody does the same for me. At end of the day I got myself. I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for myself being strong you know.

depression,fqbrlz2,t1_fqbg3lw,1589242568.0,"I relate to that. When I used to smoke tree with some friends I start to laugh and be happy but I felt ashamed for actually feeling good about myself and I stopped immediately. I was used to being sad and not confident in myself that change was so weird to me. Everyone had a perception of the old me and it gave me a hard time to truly be who I wanted to be. Thats when I had pain within myself, I didnt love myself at all. Your life changes once you change and give yourself that love and self care that nobody else gave you. It all starts from you."
spirituality,fqbr05i,t1_fqbeqss,1589242241.0,Facts. Cant hold in that anger and hate. Not good for your soul. You have to be at peace within and realize we’re all connected. If they did something that was wrong its because they have pain within themselves. At the end of the day evil doesn’t actually want to be evil. Good always overcomes. Change your frequency to being pure love and see how much changes in your life.

depression,fqbqf2u,t3_ghvz5k,1589241915.0,You can’t keep being upset when a friend doesn’t invite you somewhere. Stop being so dependent on others cause you will just feel like shit constantly. Learn to love yourself and be at peace within. Friends are temporary anyways. I used to be like that. Always noticing how people never put effort to message me first. After awhile I stopped giving a damn. I worked on self improvement and meditating. Connecting with my higher self. Evolving myself spiritually.
Buddhism,fqbptwk,t3_ghodxk,1589241594.0,That looks so peaceful
Meditation,fqbpmzz,t1_fqarnio,1589241490.0,Yeah so many people live with like depression or anxiety and they don’t truly care for themselves like others do normally. They have to put in more effort for such basic things. Its hard but it can get better.
Meditation,fqbpg0s,t3_ghm2tc,1589241386.0,Thank you. I always forget that this is my body and my thoughts. Im with myself everyday. Why do I forget to love myself you know? Treat yourself with respect.
depression,fqb6x5z,t1_fq936lm,1589231643.0,"Facts same here. I only fw people who understand and been through it. If im around people who are too extroverted and happy, never had troubles with depression or any serious issues in life I cant really relate to them. I mean yeah I still like to have fun and all that but like I can’t communicate and be open about the deep thoughts I have. Idk I suffered a lot but I came to accept all that pain because it made who I am right now. I got into meditating and became such a more spiritual person. Im only 19 but my mind and soul feel so much older when im talking to people my age. Its weird."
depression,fq6f0wl,t3_ggzzpd,1589130256.0,"Yeah you were the type of people before that would make me feel worse for saying shit like that when I was going through it. All good tho now you understand. Just gotta work on it and focus on self improvement. You got the potential in yourself. We all do. We’re all connected, we’re all one. Spread love."
depression,fpzc2it,t3_gg5o3r,1589016337.0,Relatable bro. Its hard sometimes. Everything is so meaningless and I feel like im in a dream. I force myself to just survive and do the most basic things everyday.

These are your thoughts and emotions not anyone else’s. You are capable of doing so much. You already have the potential within yourself.

I guess I had to let go cause im not doing shit in my life and its sad. I barely started to get myself situated, finally getting a job and all that. Just tryna move out thats my goal. I spent years playing games and smoking avoiding my problems but now I have to be strong for myself and face them. I know im a good person but I was just lost and didnt have support from any family or friends. I stopped having that toxic mindset where I was waiting for someone to notice that I was in pain and needed help so I decided to give myself that love I didn’t receive yet I gave to others despite my pain. It all starts from you. No one can change you but you."

selfimprovement,fmb8va8,t1_fmb3n0y,1585921270.0,Thanks bro. But yeah I actually do meditate and workout! Its the reason why I feel better about myself! I was in a dark place mentally and had some unresolved stuff I ignored. I used my addictions to escape it but I finally let go and made that change. Im a very spiritual person.
depression,fmag5ni,t1_fm8yc8r,1585893042.0,Speaking facts. Thats why so many dudes are addicted to games. To have that sense of purpose. Shits sad. Reality is disappointing. It could have some good things tho. I love music and working out pretty much it lol

I guess its because I spent most of my life alone. Ive gotten used to it. I have a few bros thats it.

Or even have the slightest care to even listen. You have to give yourself some self love. I had a toxic trait of thinking others will notice im depressed and suicidal but no one did. I know no one reads minds but idk I just felt it was so obvious. So instead I just focused on myself. For starters I gave up my addictions and started to actually care about my well being. I started to work out and I finally got off my ass and got a job. I was okay with rotting away. Im still sad dont get me wrong but at least im starting to have a little purpose in my life right now. I know its hard for you and I dont know your personal life but just day by day. Try to meditate, eat healthier and have a hobby to keep you busy. All love."
