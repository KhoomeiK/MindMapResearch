OCD,fc1rsle,t1_fb9fzkd,1577327686.0,"
I am not a professional but i will share my experience and advice. You can also ask me some questions about my own recovery.

Alright first of all i would suggest you obswrve the thoughts and not react. Reacting distracts you from the experience and answer in fact you are missing something then. The thing is while you observe, you have to observe what you feel. And what you feel is anxiety lile ever sufferer. Now even the thought of being afraid of ""not being anxious enough"" is fear. And the fact you are afraid of these thoughts means you have nothing to do with them and that you are actually so morale and kind that this is more difficult for you than many. Also remind yourself that it is only in your head. Ask yourself: Can you actually do something by thinking about it? No so it is not an action. Now after finding out that they are just thoughts and fear, you have to be positive and ask yourself like sure it is painful but is there a benefit? Well the thoughts actually increase ypur morality and values even more because OCD is a reminder of what your values actually mean to you so the fact that these thoughts are distressing proves that they would never come true and have anything to do with reality.

Now i am not a professional so ask your therapist but i try to give advices about my experience. Now the healing process is alwayd though but you need patience. Just try to actually allow the thoughts tp happen and then remind yourself that they are only thoughts and not any type of reality or action. As you keep teeling yourself that, the anxiety and the thoughts lesson. After ERP lasts long like with me, you won't even remember most thoughts. But yeah work with your therapsit.

>theyâ€™re"
OCD,f721t1f,t1_f6z9cga,1573352155.0,"Exactly and this is a sign that we need to keep doing ""Exposure Response Prevention ERP"" and also ""actively choose to disregard"" the thoughts. Fact is we need to do work. The cure is not coming from nowwhere. It is in our power. I notice with each time the thoughts weaken. It improves and improves. I just feel like it gets better."
OCD,f6y3w5l,t3_dtmm42,1573266882.0,"First of all it does not matter what tyoe of thought you get, it is OCD and the fact you are afraid of it proves that you are the opposite. You are so much like extremely far away from the pedophiles. Pedoohiles see pleasure in their sexual abd twisted views however you are afraid of children potentially being harmed so you actually have a very high morality but you also care very much for others safety especially children. So you have POCD but if you try to inform yourself on OCD Recovery and do it you shall find a way how to deal with this."
OCD,f6sdehp,t3_dsvbob,1573132197.0,That scenario just happened with me XD
OCD,f6s031s,t3_dskesf,1573123732.0,"Well depends on if we allow it. We can actively choose to ""ignore"" and ""disregard them"" and push forward."
OCD,f6k9xv8,t3_drli5z,1572908372.0,"Sure we can talk. Pure OCD is something i slowly learn to master but yeah if you like, we can talk."
OCD,f65qlcb,t1_f65ke8a,1572704405.0,"I can understand you clearly. I myself still struggle but here is what i suggest you to do:

Do not look at your past at all. Close the door to it completely and live with that uncertainity. I hate it myself but that is the first step and then try to be in the moment. Next step is to switch your thinking to psoitivity and have true faith that you will overcome this no matter how hard it will be. And while doing so, think of a beautiful wish you had as a child that motivates you more. And then you need to train your brain to be more optimisitc. 

And yeah we won`t recover instantly. It takes some time. Maybe even a month but that is why patience is needed. Don`t give up if you have some backlash. I started and worked on recovery for 2 weeks now and in this time i had some massive backlashes including strong panic attacks where i believed i would commit a crime but i always reminded me that is is just OCD and not real. And thoughts are not actions.

Fact is: Try to develope yourself to a state where OCD is irrelevant to you and just a little fly. And since we always ""think"", we humans need to get a lot of activity and hobbies or else we will develope these issues. I thought i could heal by being in the house the whole time but it makes everything worse. Go outside and have trust in yourself.

And i am not a professional so ask therapist and professional first. I am just a fellow OCD patient like you guys. But yeah what helps me is to fill my head with constant activity and at some point i will not remember OCD. I improved so much and so i need to keep going. I actually recovered from OCD once and then fell back into it recently but i instantly worked on recovery myself so i get out faster. 

OCD usually returns when we have not much do or it comes randomly back. But whenever it pops up, i know how to handle it. I definitely trust myself more than my thoughts. It is though but i have faith i can grow out of it.

But i think we should not wait for the moment of recovery. We just need to keep moving and then we will eventually forget. Just never give up."
OCD,f64wkb2,t3_dqfqio,1572696834.0,"The best answer to the issue is to just occupy yourself with something productive and do not even try to ""want the thoughts dissapear"". Just put your attention fully on something you like to do and you atuomatically will forget and not even return to the Internet and read about it. I think i may even forget that i had OCD and so i just choose to put my attention on something without the intention of getting rid of the thought but just doing it."
OCD,f61ujok,t3_dpr7jg,1572647411.0,"I myself currently struggle on doing this. It really is a challenge. Just yesterday, i saw your post and felt about moving on but a panic attack brought me close to ruminating again but now it is close of being over."
OCD,f5wplmf,t1_f5wgfmf,1572528410.0,"I felt like you some days ago and years ago too. And trust me i had every type of horrible image possible or beyond that. Just let me tell you one strong advice i wish i had sooner: It is all just temporary. It will pass. You need to let the thoughts go through and not engage with them. By reacting to them as i still do, you cause the thoughts to get worse, stronger and you keep them alive. I think it sounds weird but i think if we OCD sufferers did allow the thoughts at the beginning, nothing happened.

&#x200B;

But sounds easier than done. Our brains function different. We do not see things like others. In the eyes of others we are normal which is true. In our clouded view, we were near to commit crimes. But it is our brain playing that trick on us."
OCD,f5tb8wx,t3_dp7cxr,1572454602.0,Happened to me.
OCD,f5si50n,t1_f5sh4kz,1572431603.0,"I don't know. I always repeat to myself that i swear on God/Allah and everything ic are about that i would never harm anyone however yesterday night it was scary. I tried to resist but it was so strong that i was in a full state of anxiety i no longer understand.

I shaked around and my mind questioned myself and my whole life decisions constantly. I repeated constantly that i am responsible for each of my action and that i want to choose the good side in life. However the force was so powerful and i instantly forgot why the whole anxiety attack happened and what triggered it before i slept."
OCD,f5q75jf,t1_f5q5e2e,1572373492.0,"The feeling of ERP is ugly as hell but works. The worst is my fear of ""forgetting that it is ERP and that i accidently could act the thought out"" ((which is also OCD))"
OCD,f5q4hqx,t1_f5q24en,1572372415.0,"Good gried. Yeah i probably just still fear that doing nothign results in terror but did i ever try? No. So i should really try not doing anything. However my mind tells me ""The last time you had an anxiety time should have been the moment where you should have gotten aware of this. Now it is too late"" but yeah.

I just feel guilty on a large scale. I did absolutely nothing, Never intended absolutely nothing and yet i feel like i murdered, raped and tortured people by ""thinking it"" but the ""thought"" is not even my fault. I think subconsciously i still blame me for my thoughts however a feeling tells me that the thoughts come as fast as they go so i just need to do nothing and stay on track."
OCD,f5n63r5,t1_f5msxkj,1572297011.0,"I know right. I had this situation thursday, saturday and today where for a moment my mind is totally out of control so in that which i call ""abxiety shook or shower"", i am incapable to do a move, to go against the thoughts, technically i am paralyzed and well i am not in my body kinda ((this is also why i always believe i could have done something bad in that state later on which is not true)) however this anxiety lessens as i allow the thoughts flow. 

But the uncertainity of this moment i totally forgot about is surely is something frightening. For a normal person, it is fine when they know that the outcomes is fine. In my case the outcome is actually greater than i hoped however as an OCD sufferer i often hate it when one part of the process is filled with uncertainity. I now slowly start to accept everything as the outcome is something i should ve grateful and happy for. 

I may never find an answer to this lost memory and perhaps it's better that way."
OCD,f5lszzv,t1_f5je9hj,1572282921.0,"Yeah. I usually think something, then think why i thought it and then think why i did even allow it? Then i think why i did not just ignore when i know it is OCD? Then i think about if it really was OCD? And so on goes the mind game."
OCD,f5gsxqm,t3_dnw4j8,1572196797.0,ðŸ˜­ I can recognize myself here
OCD,f5d30dq,t3_dnjaes,1572147835.0,"It annoys me. Especially after all the times OCD made me feel like i slaughered all of humanity in my mind because of ""action-fusion"" thinking, i hate when people take it lightly. It isn't. OCD chabges everything in your life. Even if you can habdle it well, it's appearance turns everything aroukd entirely."
OCD,f59wnuo,t1_f59urub,1572096660.0,"Yeah i will do my best work. I feel like i will laugh about myself when i get out of this cycle. It really seems bad but it passes and yeah resisting in itself causes the story go on. I feel like an idiot but in fact i could have stopped my whole OCD suffering by not reacting so hard to the first thought ((well i did not know better)). To me OCD is a parasyte that does want to feed of your compulsions by triggering you with what you hate. But i figured out in order to win the battle i mustn't do anything at all. The moment i just allow it, my head feels like dark spirits or something inside of it is cleaned away and suddenly i see more clear. It will be alright."
OCD,f57sjy0,t1_f57kbxz,1572042702.0,You have to try and live on. Seek professional help in this case. If OCD already reached this level where you consider to die and trust me i know how you feel because i did feel like you and sometimes i do recently wonder how death is freedom however i choose to live on.
OCD,f56ntvb,t1_f560r06,1572025517.0,Thanks and yeah it is difficult. Especially with these messed up thoughts. But i try my best to get better.
SuicideWatch,f55fie5,t3_dmqav9,1572006510.0,Do you intend to kill yourself? I hope not.
OCD,f4z3rwr,t3_dm7x03,1571893699.0,"I don't think so. It always differs from individual to individual. There are people who did think too much but still lived long.

I stopped overthunking but i did in the past and when i had paranoia, checking doctors it was always all fine. Don't believe this or you get another intrusive thoughts.


Kill the ""what if"" inside of you. It is what creates OCD thoughts. Kill the reasurance. Try to allpw to live with uncertainty. We sufferers of OCD have the issue that we think of billions of scenarios but hey only one scenario will happen and you have to choose that one scenario and only think of that."
OCD,f4vrqgl,t3_dlyfrx,1571846839.0,I choose that sex cannot happen for me because it would make me feel like a rapist. I am very extreme with this.
OCD,f4vr84d,t3_dlyl1a,1571846634.0,Yesterday i tried and i suffered for a long time. It was horrible. I hope today i will succesfully sleep.
OCD,f4vp8mx,t3_dm0nz9,1571845815.0,I had the same but i know now that i am a good person. It takes some time.
OCD,f4uhu25,t3_dlpun7,1571811282.0,That just looks like me all the time.
OCD,f4rfbuq,t3_dlip92,1571766802.0,"The moment i got random thoughts about sexually touching people because i swear i never had any thoughts like these ever. It was not something i would pay attention torwards. The first time i had these thoughts i was like ""What? What the hell is going on?""

Horrible. It just came out of nowwhere. I was terrigied to the core and too be honest i first was worried if i had some dark thoughts but i refused to believe that i am in any way a bad person i first believed it would pass however it got worse. ((Too be honest if i would have known that allowing the thoughts is all i need to do, i might have avoided a lot of suffering but anyway i discovered online OCD and after so much disgusting thoughts and horror i felt, i just saw that everything in OCD matches my case. So yeah."
OCD,f4nevu0,t1_f4nbpqy,1571688736.0,"Thank you. That's true. It just feels so real. Yeah OCD kinda picks what i love the most. Recently 

1.Morality = OCD sends me all the things i hate lile murderer, rape, beating someone up and all hprroble stuff because that's what is opposite of my morality.

2. The love and care for my hairs = OCD tried to tell me that i would like to destroy my hairs on purpose all the time. It was annoying but i know there is no guarantee but well i can feel that i am a candidate who will keep his hairs very long so i take care of it everyday and OCD kinda also bullied me in showing me pictures of me destroying it on purpose or wishing for it's destruction even though i did nothing.

But i tried one thing now: Exposure. It feels ugly but somehow allowing the thoughts and accepting, gives me an awakening in the head proving me how absurd and untrue the OCD thoughts are. I just try to let them flow. The reason why i fall back is my brain tells me allowing and accepting the thoughts is like admitting they are true which is wrong too so well."
OCD,f4mturd,t3_dl0akf,1571682376.0,"1. My biggest issue is my mind is in an ""all or nothing state"" meaning the moment my mind thinks something and it even feels real, it is confirmed to be true no matter what so i expect from myself to defelct the thought in 0,00000001 seconds as fast as i can. Allowing the thoughts feels lile agreeing to them in some way.

2. I wish that i can do everything like i used to do. Calm, Free, Conscious. Well the times before OCD hit me. Just be free from this struggle. I wish for answers about myself."
OCD,f4at5li,t3_dk0pae,1571500979.0,"The one thing that seems most difficult to do fpr us but the only true way as mentioned above too: Move on and let these thoughts just flow.

I myself and you my fellow sufferers ((I am no professional)) would never do wrong or what these thoughts show us. We are decent goos human beings and we always fight against these thoughts. We hate and fear these thoughts. That past of OCD battle in itself is a prove that these thoughts have nothing to do with us. They will never ever happen and they are just thoughts. A tiny thing. They are not part of reality. By us taking them serious and fighting them, we make them stronger and only put more burden on us and by avoiding life because of them, we give them power. 

We have to always strongly remember that they are not equal to actions. They are thoughts and they do not exist. They appear strong and overhelming however they are all lies and fake. We need just to do hobbies and get active in order to move on.

They stay thoughts. Thoughts are not actions. Thoughts are not actions ((I r
Write this comment to myself as well and repeat this as reminder)) and just a moment ago, i thought something bad and i just believe i did it in less than a second however nothing happened. These thoughts like a devil appear to be very real but they are not. Absolutely not. 

We need to let them come and go. Because everything is actually fine. But they cloud your vision but by kot taking them serious, they lose their power again so yeah. We need patience and endure them all. Over time they pass away."
OCD,f4ap35s,t1_f4am3la,1571498766.0,"Yeah i i know. I should do the same as you. I mean my OCD thought even comes up with things like ""Do you prefer to stab yourself or someone else? And i then say ""I normally do not wanna die but i would kill myself and then OCD says ""So you do not want to live? How ungrateful of life you are"" and me ""NOOOOO FORGIVE ME GOD!!"" or question Would you rather have this or that thought? And unfortunately after my mind is rustled beyond reason, i actually just pick a choice only to be upset about it because i don't like questions like these. 

So it is a pretty tricky thing. But yeah i know OCD is like the whispers of the devil. I kinda start to believe everyone who suffers from OCD is actually very blessed and highly sensitive of the devil ((i know sounds mad but helps me to get some positive energy in my battle with OCD)) 

So yeah i need to stop answering these questions. I do not have to make a choice."
OCD,f45zfij,t3_dji45l,1571401384.0,I feel like you. I did even wish at some point that children no longer exist and that every human being is already born in adult form. That's how much i wanted to avoid it.
OCD,f40d6jx,t1_f3zh70c,1571294545.0,I had the same. It is psychosomatic. Youbare thinking about it so the nerves in your body are affected at these mentionend specific areas.
OCD,f3z8k9g,t1_f3z7sh1,1571264182.0,"Yeah but the fact that you must puke proves that you are against these dark thoughts. If yoi were a bad person, you would not even write this here. A bad person would not care and just go on like it's nothing special. So your pain of this is a good sign. The dark thoughts are painful to you? That means you are good. Now OCD to all of us only exists in our mind only. What is produced in these thoughts is not you. It will never ever happen in reality. You need to keep remember that the thoughts are lying. You are a good person. It is just difficult to understand things when the intrsuive thoughts mess around with you and torture your mind. But it will get away when you recognize that they are just thoughts and not actions. Thoughts are only thoughts."
OCD,f3z722p,t1_f3z6h6k,1571263601.0,"The fact that you are stressed and uoset about this proves that you are actually a good person and that you don't like the thought. Sometimes we are as humans ""overhelmed"" ""tired"" and i mean at some point you are powwred oit where you cannot supress the thought anymore and let it flow. Trust me nothing will happen. You are not bad. Your mind tricks you. I was also tricked by my mind today again even thougj yesterday i have sworn to not let that happen but yeah."
OCD,f3z6lp6,t1_f3yps1w,1571263391.0,"The difficult thing is that they don't really have any idea how that feels. When you tell them about the thought coming unwanted in the mind, they still kinda may not truly be capable to imagine ""how"" that exactly feels. It is really hard to imagine. But well it should still be good to teach them."
OCD,f3yk23f,t1_f3xxvwu,1571255148.0,"Thank you for those words. Yeah it is true. In the end no matter how often it happened, nothing actually happened at all. Only in my mind and it lasts only a second but it feels real but i hahe a long experience so i no longer believe the thoughts that much. I just hate the experience of the thoughts. It feels just disgusting and horrible.  But yeah the fact that we worry so much about it proves we are the LAST people to harm a child. Right now i am better. I still feel like i should have resisted the thoughts back then because i always still fear in a small way things could happen. I know for a fact my thoughts used to be worse and now they are no longer that bad. But it kinda still bugs me.

So now i know they are liars like the thoights however somehow they try to bring ridiculous phrases in like ""You commit the worst crimes just for no reason so you can make yourself a bad person and cry about yourself"" and i am like ""Ok now the thoughts start to become try hards"" so the good sign is i know them and they are also starting to slowly die because they only can bring a very few tactics to confuse me but usually i watch through it fast. 

Today i was a bit exhausted. I think that lead to this mess in my mind."
OCD,f3xl0x3,t1_f3xjulu,1571240012.0,I have been in therapy once and know that it is all false however my mind lately was again overhelmed by it.
OCD,f3v43eb,t3_di3snp,1571171336.0,"My OCD started when i was 19 in 2017 and until now i improved but the thoughts recently got stronger again.

Now before OCD, i was entirely different. I can see it in two ways: OCD may have brought me into trouble but somehow out of this storm i emerged stronger and more confident in myself. So yeah."
OCD,f3v3h6x,t3_didff5,1571171147.0,"You are not a monster. The fact that you even consider the thought prove your morales and integrity. We as sufferer from OCD have to keep strong until the very end and hold on hope. I know it will get better at some point. I myself have a hard time right now but i know deep inside those with OCD are actually one of most morale and blessed individuals. Perhaps because we are so morale and full of integrity, we are more sensitive torwards danger than other people. So yeah."
OCD,f3rvbyf,t3_dhu5j2,1571092490.0,"That's OCD and you know that. Now why the erection? Because your body is psychosomatic and like when the intrusive thought comes, it comes. Also the fact that you feel anxiety about it proves that you are not a pedophile. A pedophile would not even feel anxiety or any bad feeling because it is their sexuality. Now the fact that you did not move your leg away was probably because you were overhelmed and frozen in fear. Your OCD then said: ""LOOK LOOK YOU DID NOT MOVE AWAY IN 0,00000001 SECONDS. TOO SLOW. YOU ARE DOOMED TO HELL"" but it is a mind trap. Your brain fools you. Also erections sometimes randomly come. It is not always sexually related. Go to a therapist and treat it. No need to call police or kill yourself. That's not the solution and yoir situation is harmless. Well the fact you already talk here and see it as wrong proves that you are one of the people who are absolutely impossible of being a pedophile. The fact you are worried proves your high integrity and concern. You are definitely not a pedophile. Your mind wants you to believe this. Don't fall for the trap. Seek professional help.

It was just yesterday that they came back however i can easily identify them as lies and nothing related to reality. In fact i know the stuff my thoughts project are never gonna happen in any way. But i am afraid of the thoughts themselves. To me a thought still equals an action. I know had a sleep and i probably need to start doing more activity.

Also in the end one friend who you can trust and rely on and who is standing besides you in hard times is better than an army of friends that only stand with you in good but not bad timed. You may not have a friend now but the best frirnds usually are difficult to find and will come with time. Please don't do it. You will regret your decision definitely.

Also we all will die one day so why not try to see until the end. No matter how mucj hard comes, keep going so you can make sure that you won't regret. We do not know the future. Something great may wait for you.

Also God is all knowing and most loving and most merciful but god unlike us is the only one who is perfect and so every creation he makes has a meaning. There is no miscalculation in his plans. We humans are just inferior beings and do kot understand the plan of god at first. Sometimes waht you perceive as bad is actually a blessing.

Perhaps you shoild start being your best friend. Love yourself first before trying to get friends. Learn yourself. Meditate. Observe. Never give up. Try to do hobbies. Something that makes you happy."

AMA,f16oe4q,t1_f15e0cd,1569218513.0,"What i meant with random is that i did not think much of it. It is hard to describe and i personally myself can't believe that i did buy this stuff and did a few things with it. I was not like a guy that prepared some fire attack for certain date. I just randomly lighted some stuff when i was frustrated and angry but instantly afterwards i had no idea anymore why i did it and just moved on with the day and thankfully my materials were very cheap and only could create tiny flames because after each time i kinda just talked with my classmates and everyone in a relaxed way. 

I can safely say that should the school really be on fire because of me i may have committed suicide or not but i definitely would not be able to live on because i was a ""dreamer"" who imagined like inn fantasy. It even scares the hell out of me that until yesterday i did not feel any scared about myself back then. And i just randomly got the idea so of course my bully triggered me but it was not truly revenge but well i hated that school so maybe but i feel like i just randomly picked this style up. But at some point i stopped doing it. It was a phase in which i was not pretty right in my mind because out of all my life stages, this one is hard to remember. It does not mean that i try to not be responsible or anything but more that i am confused but no one knows. None of the school. I told my mother later and she was shocked but she told me not to dwell in the past because these actions haunt me a bit. It was definitely irresponsible. And to some point i hate myself for engaging in stuff like this.

Also i remember that i just tried to create fire and instantly when it did not work i was like ""Ok whatever"" and then i just moved on with life and did not feel like i ever tried to do anything. I am really scared remembering that now and just thankful that my materials were incapabÃ¶e of creating a big fire. But it was insane."

It should not matter if people get upset over you telling your parents or teacher. You have a right to enjoy your class and bullying should not happen there.

Like i fought back with words and rage but usually pnce you do that, they act like you are the bad guy or bully but when you let them run you over, they kinda push you to destruction too. I think the teachers and parents have to be more aware as children and teenagers still lack a certain ability of rationality. I am 22 now but when i was 17, i really escalated into imagining how tp torture my bullies and i am not the tyoe to even fight. I hate any form of conflict even the tiniest arguments so me having such an image triggered speaks a lot ((and i am not saying i am all holy and purr but i really was never a guy that wanted trouble to anyone)) and i  countries like the USA bullying can end deadly with the victim either commiting suicide or shooting the bully but look i tell you what the best thing to do is: Get help. Somewhere you will get help. There is service to help woth bullying. Search for help untio you find it. Going through this alone like i did is risky. I got out of my past save but it was really some kind of hell with these bullies that keep trying to mentally break you. Don't take all of this alone. I mean i assume you are not an adult. Adults can take it but as for younger proplr they still grow and develope so you could end up getting paranpia or some mental issues when you fight the bullies. It is a waste of time but of course they will keep picking on you so best thing is to dit back, get help like here in reddit posting is the first step. I did not do that during my times of beong bullied but in real life look for help and think this through calmly. Don't do something you could regret later on."

NPD,ezk6819,t1_ezjwlky,1567955561.0,I see. It is nice that you discovered this. Well Narcissists exist on a spectrum. Each one of us humans have some narcissistic tendencies. I admit myself to have adapted a little bit because my father was some kind of narcissist but i would say i am not a narcissist because i have this empathy for others. I would describe narcissism as a problem once it goes over 50 % so narcissism in itself becomes bad when it is too much and defines a person. Just my view. Well i am not a narcissist but i have OCPD and Paranoia which is personality disorder that also likes control and has issues accepting not to be in control so i understand some part of the narcissist. I think the only thing i do not understand about narcissists is the lack of empathy because i have a lot of empathy but self awareness is the first step to change so i wish you good luck with treating your issue.
SuicideWatch,ez6tnhs,t3_d02wvf,1567715115.0,It is hard for you. I can imagine but don't do it. There is always a way and reason to fight to keep living. It is never too late once you are alive.

I believed that just ending myself is corwardice so i have to just wait for it)) but today i am 22 and optimisitic. Myself now and when i was 17 and 18 are polar opposites.

I may have a different path and past and today as a 22 year old i come close to full recovery after series of self torture, depression, paranoia, severe OCPD and so on maybe even OCD and i was many times visualizing my death. I somehow backed out of the 2 times where i felt like hurting myself extra but perhaps it was my beloved mother and family that kept me away from a real serious sttempt and the 2 times i tried something were in unconscious mind as i obsessed over the interent and got kinda insane but i went through a lot and i never believed my life would turn around like this. More positive than i hoped it would be so yeah for now try to look back at your life and think of something i  the future you would like to do or look forward to. Of course your anxiety and all depression will not disapear i  days but longer time but have passion. Once you are alive, it is never too late for a change. Try to keep dtrong until the natural death comes because it is better dying while having used and tried all chances instead of ending it without having tried something because there might be something waiting for you."

I am a living example of how a bad state is just the preparation for the best state you could ever have even better than you wanted. Letting God and Fate handle the things i can't control ended up being worth it.

I had mental illness in a very paranoid and self destrucrice form and i understand the thought of feeling like a burden and seeking death but i think every human should keep trying to push the good out of life.

SuicideWatch,ew3u3ka,t1_ew3tb9o,1565094874.0,I think it is good you failed. You need professional help. I myself as a child and teen used to be a though guy who said proudly that nothing would shake him down and that i confirmed to myself that i would never come close to suicide but in the end i still did in a unconscoous state of mind probably like you. In my case i recognized others to be depressed but i never believed i myself was depressed. I should have seeked to get help much earlier. Would have prevended much suffering and pain. Suicide is an action where one  individual is not capable to think rational and not in their right state of mind. It is the result of an untreated depression and mental illness. They are treatable.

SuicideWatch,ew1dquo,t1_ew090l3,1565021187.0,"Yeah i am convinced that had to happen to make me see my purpose and value. I just don't wanna feel alone because my version is something i would call pretty strange. I know god wanted it. But no it is ok. You can make comparrison. I really just want someone to talk to. I feel this shame. But yeah my mind was so clouded and delusional that maybe these low point hits were neccesary to wake me up and yeah when a depressed person has to change, they need and will chabge everything. I currently check out stories of people that survived worse. I mean i never wanted to inflict pain on my family in fact i believed everyone except my mother would not care but they do. I know all my relatives still care. Even if my father is emotionally distant, i think he does but i still say my mother is the main reason and motivation alongside god and the afterlife why i keep hanging on. 

I try to see what positives i can get from these. First i never ever consider suicide in anyway. I am not even suicidical and i am incapable of that state completely now. But i still feel empathy for those who are and try to prevend anyone else from doing it. Then i want to make things better with children of my own. 

But fact is the shame for my action remains. It is hard for me to believe i considered death at one point. I don't even remember what got me into this hell. But mental illness really can cloud ones judgement. I see that now. The difficulity of carrying such experiences is terrifying and overwhelming. The fact that i myself was my.own enemy and danger to myself is hard to believe because i know i never really wanted to die. It is complex. Suicidical mindset and behaviour is very complex. It is not easy to explain"
SuicideWatch,ew1dmm4,t1_ew0sxtq,1565021111.0,"But now after knowing this, you cannot just choose death. You actually need to trust in God that everything will be better and that you need to hang on there."
SuicideWatch,ew04vrq,t1_ew0301b,1564975865.0,"Rape victims? But i don't remember being raped. I sometimes questionend it because of something weird about my sexuality but i personally don't recall anything. And i see. Well i guess that i feel very weird. I wish i would never have done the attempt. I can't believe that i am the type that would come close to it. I mean it was spray and i am alive right now. I am very happy with my current position and potential and my mind likes to look for what if scenarios in the past. But i believe in God and that he saved me.

Now i was never raped...i hope at least...but i was bullied and beaten up in kindergarden and at the same time my narcissistic father blamed me for being too weak or crying or like i was punished for stuff children cannot control like pissing into my pants....apparently my father until this day has this high ego and makes it always extra difficult...which is why i blame his influence too....I was bullied but i could have had my family as support and my home but nope my father was always there and i guess i turned impulsive and very agressive over years. Later i ended up being bullied and then falsely accused for a darl joke and i think i learned that the world in reality is bad....i choose to succumb to the obsessio  of the Internet and i ended up believing things in there really matter.....My suicide attempts were happening because of something fictional but during that time i always said ""Someone who commits suicide over a cartoon is insane and kinda...well i could not understand someone like this"" yet i was in that moment totally posessed by something. But if i am honest i do not know the reason at all why i snapped out....i guess after this time, things were never the same again....i feel like my soul...heart has a really big scratch....i feel still Ã¶ile death is beautiful but bexause of my religious belief and my family i wanna do grest work and have an impact on the world and after this i wanna die as i believe in a word after death but i wanna die natural as all lofe belongs to God in my view but it makes me sick that i can only live because of my belief....maybe the food....but i really wanted to be happy....i also fear that my dream of being i  love with a woman cannot come and even if the feelings of me may be blocked and sabotaged by the bullying, my father and myself too. I spend most of the time ruminating and alÃ¶ i can ask myself is: How the hell could this happen? I was a child looking forward to the future. I was always trying to be safe and do good yet i ended up here. How? I don't get it. I just see myself as a tool somehow.

The positives of these things although are: I am much much stronger. Not much can shake me and also i am so far away from suicide than ever before. Like i know i will never even visuslize it. It is over and i can handle my emotions better but i still feel a bit like some empty host as if all things of the and own impusliveness beat the life out of what was inside and now i have to kinda try to act as if i am a new reborn person. And yeah my religous believe and spirituality increased beyond what i can describe so i received good things as a result. I mean good thing is next time something traumatic happens, i will not go mad but handle myself."
SuicideWatch,evzvet9,t1_evg12fd,1564968326.0,"Depends on what kind of suicide.

God would punish suicide bombings and people who commit suicide for the sake of terrorizing people or to rebel against God.

Bit suicide that happens when someone is not in their right mind because of mental illness or traumatic events is forgiven. It depends on the cricumstances and what went through the mind of an individual. That goes for all sins. The intention matters more than the act itself."
SuicideWatch,evzul12,t1_evip2vj,1564967693.0,"Dying through illness is natural and as for those killed by others they are innocent. I mean it depends on what kind of guy you were in life. An innocent good man who is shoot goes straight to heaven meanwhile a rapist and murderer who gets shoot by another criminam will face consequences for his crimes and could go to hell but the guy who killed him also faces trouble.

But in the case of suicide yoi see the ""intention"" is the deal. A guy who is oit of control and shoots himself in impulse is forgiven without a doubt because he was not in his right mind. Suicides that are not planned and happen out of being too overhelmed will be forgiven. Suicides that are consciously planned and also with the belief that one reaches paradise instantly and also for the sake of making things easier have a problem bit these types of suicides are rare. Majority of suicides happen unconsciously after a series of inner suffering. The suicides that are forgiven without a doubt are the unnanounced ones. The ones that were not planned but happened out of frustration but a planned suicide can also be forgiven because the person migjt be very depressed and out of his or her mind. I think most people who commit suicide because of mental illness are forgiven but like the punishement for suicide refers more to people who consciously wither think they can go to paradise fast, do it to punish relatives or attention or those who just randomly choose to take the easy way but those guys are very rare. Majority of them are not in their right state of mind. You het what i mean? It depends on what is in the person's heart and mind at the moment they do it. In general it is never the sin itself but the intention and agenda behind it. For example a guy who is out of his mind and kills someone in a state of where he had no control over him is forgiven meanwhile a guy who consciously with full awareness kills is potentially going to hell. Each single lifeform is judged individually. You can't just overgeneralize when it comes to Gods/Allahs judgements. Not every suicidical person is the same. There is a difference between an innocent woman that was raped and tortured and killed herself and a terrorist who blows himself up to take others down with him. And there is a difference between the bipolar guy on one side who shoots himself in frustration and impulse and the guy who jumps before a train with the desire to punish all those that in his eyes wronged him and to get attention. See it is always different."

SuicideWatch,evreqx0,t1_evl2axi,1564706771.0,"Let me ask you one question. What exactly lead you to your suicidical or negative vision? You were not born suicidical. Babies and little children do not kill themselves unless ""someone"" influences them. It is not God who did anything bad. God gave us free will and choice which is why we can even talk and argue here. If we had no free will, God could make us robots without a sense of seÃ¶f that just follow orders but God did want us to have free will and choices so we have a meaning. So the negative view on life was caused by society and your environment. You need to really pay attention now on what exactly drives you mad. You do not know the entire world and everything of life. There is much more unknown to you than you think. You only know what your experienced so far. 

You need to question yourself and dig deep for an answer individually for your case. Suicidical people are not a group. Everyone individually has a different reason. Some are suicidical but find reason to stay alive. Some attempt it and then suddenly back out of it. While some succeed with it unfortunately. Some do it unconscioisly not in their right mind but i think everyone of them has a certain ""element"" of their life that lead to this. Nothing happens without a reason. No one just grabs a blade and impales his own stomach because he feels like it. A rational mind which i had before and now after my suicidical time would not even consider it an option. Suicide mentality is an illness and a temporary state but it depends on. Some are succesfully talked out of it as they are aware of it more and seel help. Some are in believe that no one cares and recklessly rush torwards it. Some are planning but i never was like that. I never planned suicide or any suicidical things. My self harming ways where i brought myself in danger as they were impulsive acts. I am glad that i instantly backed out of them because the moment i pushed for it, something intervened in my mind. You need to know a suicidical stage can be easily made into a temporary stage. You need to somehow get out of that clouded vision. I myself never believed everything gets better but damm i feel sp great today and feel so stupid for actually having been once so self destructive but that's just how it is. So yeah you need to recognize that you need professional help and support. Don't do the same mistake i did once."

I know what i am talking about. You should stop thinking that all is your fault and that you are bad or wrong because you are not. Open up to someone and talk about this. And seek therapy. Believe it is better to avoid all the harm. I am lucky and blessed to have lived through my self destructive madness but not everyone gets that chance. So it is always neccesary to avoid such path. You also should question yourself. What do you really want in life? It is possible you choose the wrong path and seeked the wrong thing. It is definitely not your fault at all because we cannot see the future. You know what my mistake was when i was in the mode of self destruction? I swallowed everything down and denied that i am depressed and have mental illness. I thought i was right and i choose not to open up but consequences came that changed my life and left scars. I ended up growing out very strong of that but i could have went a better path as well. You need help from people. Don't isolate yourself. Isolation strenghens suicidical behaviour.
