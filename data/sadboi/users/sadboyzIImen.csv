You can’t look at someone worse than you through your own lens because then you think people are intentionally ignoring the “facts” of the game in order to play the way they do. If they knew the things you know or knew how to play the game the way you do, do you think they’d do the things you see them do?

In case this is a serious question, sportscar racing is absolutely dependent on Amateur drivers. Think about how much funding they bring. An amateur buys a car and funds a team and gives two seats to pros who share the car with them. If amateurs are banned, there is no more series or at least the grids would be tiny. To say that amateurs take seats from professional drivers is a fundamental misunderstanding of the reality of sportscar racing. Without the amateur driver, that particular car just wouldn't run. Which means that two seats that would otherwise be taken by professionals wouldn't exist anymore. So instead of taking opportunities away from professionals, amateur drivers are actually funding seats for pros to race in. 

Who do you think would pay for those teams if not the person who wants to participate in racing and has the means to do it?

Besides that, if someone has enough money to afford a car / team and wants to go racing, who are you to say they shouldn't be allowed?"
