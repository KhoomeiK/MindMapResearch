I have a lot of people but I always somehow cloud the relationship to be superficial in my minds eye when I need them the most. My partner is phenomenal but I know that I take more out of him than he can handle. 

My mother reminded me recently in a falling out that I have nobody and I’ll always be alone. Mind you, she’s a fucking NPD but some of what she said struck true. 

I’m always too confrontational and I don’t tolerate anything I consider disrespect and so it leaves me in shit ass, self righteous positions."

My diagnosis has completely changed my life and has opened up the right resources for the help I need. You cannot get DBT without a diagnosis — and it is the only treatment specifically for BPD. 

I relate to this so fucking hard, dude. My entire life I was emotionally fucked up, always feeling depressed; I tried killing myself before the age of ten, multiple times. It’s so goddamn detrimental to a child to feel so fucking misplaced their entire life on top of constant emotional and physical abuse. 

Your diagnosis absolutely matters and I understand what you mean about the identity thing. It’s hard as fuck to find a core within yourself when nothing you do makes fucking sense."
BPD,fj0xydp,t3_favtt5,1582909578.0,"As a woman who struggles with BPD and my partner is like you.. I really just have one question for you —— is she trying to be better for this relationship? Or has she decided that you are so accommodating that she is allowed to stay stagnant?

My partner is a lot like you, he tries very hard to keep me happy but it is not his job. While his support has made such an impact — it is still up to me to put in work where I see it is needed. You should not have to accommodate her. You are a team, not her coach. 

I find sometimes I take advantage of my partners kindness and I have to remind myself that my behaviour is not okay and I need to work on “x” behaviour. 

I have attacked my boyfriend before — however it made me feel so much remorse, anger and guilt that I have actively worked on not doing it ever again. 

I’m sorry but it sounds like you have given her a comfortable place to abuse you, and that is not okay. (Not your fault, it is on her to recognize and make changes)

I hope you consider that you may need to leave. Safely. She obviously is unwell and I find the ones who are intentionally ignorant to their disorders are the most dangerous. Be careful. take care of you. 

You can get CPTSD from relationships with people like us if we are not actively working towards our own healing - remember this please. Your mental health is just as fundamental and important as hers is."
BPD,fj0te09,t3_fatghd,1582907354.0,"Your mother sounds like she would lean further into the NPD realm. Regardless, I wouldn’t push any mental disorder diagnosis. You need to seek out your own therapy as it sounds she’s done a lot of damage."

BPD,f8o1cjf,t3_e12gy9,1574659127.0,"I never wanted to have kids as I wasn’t raised around them and I really did not feel I was capable myself. I have had my struggles and I absolutely have things that I wish I could do again - but I have two sons now and they push me to be the best version of myself. They are all the good pieces of me and when I can see the uglier pieces of me coming through - I can correct it to the best of my ability. 

this isn’t to say “have kids - you’ll be better for it”. But being BPD is not hereditary - they would be genetically vulnerable to develop it but with awareness it wouldn’t likely occur. That being said - just do what you feel is best. Therapy, medication and being aware of your condition are fundamental with or without kiddos but for me - my kids make my life worth living and the bonds I share with them is really incredible. 

I struggled the first year of both their lives - the post partum hit me very, very hard but as long as you have a good support system - it’s doable. Best of luck x"
BPD,f8hn0ko,t3_e0ufqc,1574577108.0,"From what I’ve been learning about splitting is it is our minds defence so you are trying not to react poorly to avoid an issue which is causing repression. You detach yourself emotionally. 

I can’t speak for your relationship and what will work; but if you haven’t tried already - just be honest with her about how you feel about the sex, that you’re frustrated (and you understand it isn’t her fault) but that you need to talk about it. 

I find the more openly I communicate, the less I split on my partner.

If you do she immediately splits and pulls the rug out from under me. 

Fuck my mom. I am always thrown into hyper vigilance when I visit her especially if she’s been drinking or getting high. 

Don’t even feel bad - we are allowed to love them because they are our mothers, but we are also allowed to stand in our feelings and they are still our abusers - whether they are accountable or not. 

Give yourself the recognition she will not. Easier said than done; but in the end you will learn to give yourself something she never will. Reassurance. Forgiveness.

My mom comes through in my parenting more than I wish, but the best thing I find myself doing as a mother that I am sure will be useful if you ever become one - ask yourself what did you need from your mother in that moment? 

Splitting with my kids is far different than when I split with my FP or anyone really. It’s like you fucking hate them but your core being fundamentally loves and cares for them."
