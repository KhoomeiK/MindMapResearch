AskReddit,fqj218o,t3_giz37i,1589403975.0,"Kung Fu Panda is a masterpiece, Kung Fu Panda 2 is trash (besides the character design of the peacock villain, which was excellent). Some of my friends think it's equally good, but I've established this hill as the one I will die on.

I feel like the first movie said so much in such few words and has a strong but artfully subtle theme, and then the second one said HEY BOTH PO AND THIS PEACOCK THINK YOU CAN TAKE HAPPINESS/INNER PEACE BY FORCE BUT ACTUALLY IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT. Rather than using nuanced symbolism, the main characters blatantly say it multiple times, really beating you to death with it. Like BRO, in the first movie Oogway tells Shifu that he's had a vision of Tai Lung's return, and it's the fucking FEATHER of the messenger bird he sends to the prison (to tell them to double the guards, et cetera) that allows him to unlock himself and escape. Besides portraying the theme of fate so beautifully, that scene is just SO fucking cool regardless of context. Also, while you obviously couldn't call it ""realistic,"" all the action in the first film feels weighty, like each impact means something. In the second, yeah there are some cool action scenes, like seeing the Furious Five fight with each other, but idk it just didn't grasp me as much. But that's also probably related to the fact that nothing ever felt dire. There was an inevitable happy ending, and all of the ""threats"" to that the movie placed as roadblocks seemed like cardboard cut-outs, placed there to throw some conflict into the story or as convenience. At least twice, all of the Furious Five members were bound by their enemies (using apparently ""top-of-the-line"" handcuffs and then TONS of chains with padlocks), and then one of them gets free/someone comes to save them, and they just punch them off instantaneously??? The short-lived, inconsequential problem-resolution thing felt so formulaic and predictable, contributing the the tiresome feel of the film. Oh, and the moment Shifu joins the big fight at the end of the second movie to fight for literally one second felt so fan-service-y, contributing absolutely nothing to the movie or the fight.

Thank you, if you wasted a portion of your life reading this."

When my partner makes comments or touches me in ways that make me feel desirable, getting dressed up, feeling confident about myself. I know that wasn't particularly relevant to your comment, just a thought I had. Making an effort to make your partner feel sexy often has a big impact on their drive. 

It sounds like more quality time together would be good, in a context other than home. When you're partnered with someone for a long time, you can associate them with mundane daily life such as chores and other not-fun adult stuff. Get out of the house (at least after covid üòÖ), and get out of your comfort zone! 

Socializing with other people in flirty ways is another big aphrodisiac for me, but my partner and I are non-monogamous and I know that sort of thing doesn't work for everyone (but I find it super exciting and sexy to talk to him about encounters afterwards-- that and having the freedom to flirt is honestly most of the fun)."

I think for women in particular, because we're basically taught that sex is ""for men"" through porn (appeals to male gaze, over when the dude cums) and advertising (using women's bodies as ornaments because ""sex sells""), to name just a couple specifics. 

I didn't realize I'd internalized all that shit until fairly recently, although I've always been open and sex-positive. Being comfortable receiving pleasure is a big one I'm still working on. I often get in my head about taking ""too long"" and thinking more about how I look/sound than actually focusing on my bodily experience.

Esther Perel does brilliant work on the subject, I'd recommend you both read her book ""Mating in Captivity."" Reading it together would also allow you two to have open communication about this so you can work on things as a team.

A phrase she uses that I think is a good, simple summary is ""fire needs air."" Desire needs some degree of mystery, excitement, whereas long term relationships breed comfort and safety. Things we need in a partner, but they don't lend themselves too much to sexual desire. I think a big part of getting away from this is to really make sure you're whole, separate people who each have their own life, hobbies, etc. You need space for passion."

nonmonogamy,fol8w73,t3_g81ijv,1587857200.0,"I'm also fairly new to non-monogamy, so am the expert by no means! But feelings of jealousy and insecurity are totally normal, especially as you're just figuring out how to navigate this change in your relationship. There's certainly a learning curve when it comes to dealing with emotions in a newly non-monogamous situation, but communicating these things as soon as possible (after you figure them out yourself, of course) gives your partner the opportunity to comfort and reassure you. 

As for asymmetry, people practice non-monogamy in SO many ways, and what works varies hugely for each couple/person. I just started listening to the podcast ""Normalizing Non-Monogamy,"" which I'd really recommend! It's interview-style, and each episode focuses on a different couple who practices non-monogamy in their own way (threesomes, swinging, FWB, DADT, polyamory, etc), and they talk about their journey and potential bumps they've dealt with along the way. I'd also add a note to not knock online dating for meeting new people! Personally I've had a lot of fun talking to people on Tinder (and have met up with one guy, who's great), but if you're looking to be more discreet there are apps and websites specifically for non-monogamous people (but you'll have to look up what some are!). 

Is there something you're looking to get out of being non-monogamous, or is it more about allowing your girlfriend to explore? Even if you're not that interested in hooking up with other people, going on dates is a great way to meet people, and having the freedom to just flirt can feel very liberating."

relationships,fo5729q,t3_g359sx,1587518915.0,"I think a lot of the differences you mentioned can actually be viewed in a much more positive light-- if you both freely communicate and are open to the other's opinions. You should both be looking for  balance... his easygoing attitude may soothe some of your anxieties, whereas you may push him to be more organized and driven. He may be the penny pincher and help you both accumulate savings, and you may encourage him to explore more of the world (or you can go on solo trips with your money if he's really that uninterested). Those two things are both reflected in my own relationship, actually! I'm more anxious and ""naggy"" (but really that's just me bearing more responsibility of organizing and maintaining the household), he's more relaxed and money-conscious. We both recognize each other's strengths and what makes us a strong team. 

In terms of drug use, that's something I'd consider to be a ""price of admission."" If it's a deal breaker for you, you have the opportunity now to walk away. If it isn't, you can't constantly get on his case about it in the future (because that's what'll breed resentment). Of course, that's not to say that certain ""rules"" can't be discussed surrounding drug use, especially when there's children in the picture. Family responsibilities would come first, and I'm sure that's something he's aware of already. 

I think perspective is the biggest problem here. Rather than arguing about your differences, be open to them and how they balance you out. Decide what your deal breakers are, and what things you're willing to put up with (because there's always something). Good luck!"

AskWomen,ffxfq63,t3_evnwjk,1580324230.0,"For chores I find it works to split up tasks we each *usually* do, but to be flexible when needed. My partner usually takes the laundry downstairs (we live in an apartment building, laundry involves going outside and a flight of stairs), I usually hang it on the rack to dry afterwards. I do the sweeping, he vacuums. We split things up pretty equally based on our chore preferences (I hate vacuuming lol), but things are never exactly 50/50. I do almost all of the cooking because I enjoy it, whereas he doesn't. Cooking all the time is a lot of extra work, but I don't mind because I'm not treated like it's something I have to do. He always voices his appreciation and doesn't expect dinner to be ready at a certain time (or at all). We thank each other constantly when we notice the other contributing to the household.

Emotional labour can mean a lot of things. If it's talking about the household still, I find I definitely do more of organizing and planning things. I'm quite a bit better at it than him, and get an odd satisfaction out of it most of the time. Honestly I enjoy the caretaker role (as an outspoken feminist who realizes not all women do and it's not our job). For emotional labour as in supporting each other, we're pretty even most of the time.

Or thinking mean things about myself when I'd be unsatisfied with my work, or fuck up something, or say something I thought was stupid. Something that's made a big difference for me is catching negative thought patterns and replacing them with something more realistic and positive. Rather than thinking ""Wow I'm a fucking idiot. That was so stupid of me and I should have known better"" when I fuck up, I catch myself and think more along the lines of ""Ugh that sucks but it's not that big of a deal. I'm going to make mistakes sometimes. I know I judge myself more harshly than anyone else does. And there's nothing I can do about it now anyways, so I may as well not dwell on it."" It's difficult but it's all about training your thinking patterns"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fftz02f,t3_ev6zjh,1580230801.0,"I think framing is a big part of how you view yourself. When you go throughout your day and catch yourself being lazy, do you think something like ""I'm going to relax for a while"" or ""I'm a lazy, useless slob for not being productive right now""? How you talk to yourself hugely affects self esteem. You seem to be placing a lot of blame on yourself. You say your money habits are ""cheap,"" but I'd say that's incredibly smart and responsible! Millions of people ""can't trust themselves"" with credit cards but use them anyways and aquire mountains of debt. As clique as it sounds, I've found examining my childhood and surrounding culture helps me figure out why I am how I am. I wasn't born with the tendency to use substances to avoid feelings I don't want to process, but we didn't discuss emotional things in my family much so maybe that has something to do with it. 

You talk about how your friends don't see all these negative traits in you, but do you see such traits in them? You don't see their constant internal battles either. Lots of people hate themselves, and everyone hates some part of themselves. You seem to separate yourself and people you view ""like yourself"" from the larger society. Your bad habits and traits are no worse than anyone else's, as much as you might believe otherwise. And from the sounds of it you're taking conscious steps towards bettering yourself, which is SO respectable and more than a ton of other people are doing (especially the support group, that takes guts!!). So give yourself some credit. Loving yourself is fucking hard.

Also never feel afraid to bring things up in therapy! That's what you're paying them for. If they say ""jUsT lOvE yoUrSeLf!"" (which I doubt they would honestly), tell them everything you wrote here. Therapists don't spout the word of God, you can challenge what they say if they're interpreting something wrong or not understanding you.

ballpython,fenupau,t1_fengipi,1579291093.0," I disagree with this, there's no reason to ""bathe"" ball pythons unless they have stuck shed (in which case a humidity box would be better still). But exercise is for sure important! Give her climbing opportunities both in her enclosure (sticks and the like) and when you bring her out. Mine loves to climb on our laundry drying rack lol, and it's great for her muscles!"

Anxiety,feadq1y,t3_eo8ep9,1578947402.0,"Fuck yeah!! I was quite the same, extremely anxious and quiet in high school, didn't really have friends. When I started uni I found a group of amazing friends I'm so comfortable with, as well as my lovely SO I'm very grateful for. My life did a 180 and I'm so happy I put myself out there. 

Go to events!! Besides the orientation week things, schools usually host a bunch of stuff that encourages socialization, and that's how I met a lot of people. Also, ""stepping stone friends"" are a thing. Meaning the people you hang out with for the first week (or however long) don't have to be your new best friends, but can be great ways to meet people you mesh with better. Congrats!!!"

Petioles,fdo5kvg,t3_emdp12,1578599288.0,"Hey man, the mental clarity doesn't have to be a negative thing. While therapy can be really helpful, they mostly just prompt you to reflect inwardly. By taking a break you're really just giving yourself the chance to dissect yourself and make efforts to improve your mental health (no matter how small) rather than avoiding it. I know you said you're not looking for advice but that's my two cents anyways lol. Good luck!!"

I was surprised you bothered mentioning that he heated up leftovers for you, and that it was ""super nice."" It's your birthday!! He could have cooked you dinner, given you a massage, made plans to spend even a bit of quality time together after you got home. You don't need extra money to make an effort into making someone feel loved and appreciated. It sounds like he is doing less than the bare minimum for what it takes to be a good partner"
ballpython,fdnljx7,t3_em9w26,1578588328.0,That's so great! üòä One of my favourite things about having a snake is helping people get over their fears. I think a lot of the fear comes from the unknown as it can be hard to read a snake's body language (as well as media representation... and the Bible lol). So exposure definitely helps.

relationships,fdl991v,t1_fdjwgu9,1578519207.0,"Don't worry about things ""being a hassle."" You know what's a huge hassle? Breaking up with someone, especially when you live together. It's a hell of a lot easier to stay in a relationship you feel ""meh"" about (which may be where she's at...).  You didn't mention anything positive about your relationship, could that be where you're at too? Far too many people stumble into relationships and keep taking steps because it's ""just how it goes,"" and find themselves in an unsatisfying marriage years later.

If you're not satisfied by your relationship, you NEED to talk about it and make conscious efforts to resolve the problems together. Healthy, fulfilling relationships take a hell of a lot of work. A lot of conversations are hard to have, but the results are so incredibly gratifying. Bring it up gently to avoid her getting defensive (""I feel"" statements, using language that suggests this is You Two vs The Problem and not You vs Her, rather than ""You always/never...""). Either she'll be glad you told her and feel bad for causing you to feel insignificant, leading to you two to make changes and have a much better relationship, or she's not the person you want to spend your life with."

relationship_advice,fdaxpo4,t1_fd7hccb,1578251618.0,"Having a pregnancy/impregnation kink is one thing, which is totally fine to have as long as BOTH partners consent to all dirty talk and play. But what he's doing is wayyy beyond that, taking it out of the sexual context and trying to force it into your whole life. OP thank god you're on the pill, because if you were relying on condoms I believe he would be poking holes in them. 

I know reddit likes to jump on the ""dump him!"" train more often then not, but he sounds very manipulative and dangerous. At the VERY least sit him down and tell him that you're no where near ready for a baby, and are made extremely uncomfortable by his actions (sexual assault would be a good word...). But please, please get out of there, for the sake of your physical safety."

sex,fckjrdf,t3_ehmvqk,1577726853.0,"Uhh how is sex usually? Is it fulfilling for you? You are absolutely not a bad person, it sounds like he's a poor partner because he doesn't give a fuck about your feelings or YOUR sexual needs. Don't EVER feel like you're a bad person for not allowing him to use you like a fleshlight. Sex is a two (or more lol) person activity, and you should be getting as much out of it as he is. Next time he begs you (""What about anal?"" seriously???), ask him when the last time he made you cum was."
