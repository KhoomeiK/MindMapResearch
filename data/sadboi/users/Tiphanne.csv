realwitchcraft,fhaenkd,t3_f1qrl0,1581407045.0,It could be completely unrelated but I had three terrifying dreams last night and I’ve been trying to lucid dream without any aids.

ptsd,fh5weeh,t3_f18z9g,1581292898.0,"First of all, love the username.

Second of all I agree completely. I think the survivor aspect is very damaging because if you “survive” someone’s  “violence” it feels like to me and I feel you share this opinion in that all of a sudden it lessen the “violence” like the perpetrators actions no longer have validity. My quotations may be incorrectly placed but I used them to emphasize what taking away the word means to the situation. The solution I believe lays in treating the person acting violently and supporting the person who was victimized with care and acceptance. 

I think about the Heard vs Depp debacle. I think they are both victims in this case and both sides are damaged and need help. Depp with his abuse of alcohol and Heard with her manipulative ways and violent out bursts. Antagonizing someone to elicit a response isn’t healthy either and responding to it doesn’t make your actions to it excusable. Two wrongs don’t make a right. 

I too see the perspective of 13 reasons why from this perspective; hurt people, hurt people. Morally unchecked neglected kids turn into irresponsibly hurt teenagers who act completely unchecked and harmful towards others because they’ve never been shown love. Bryce in this case I feel was more understood by Hannah and she truly was desperate for someone to act in a way that helped everyone. So many people had a part in her creating the desperate final act that she took.  There has to be a more complex solution to the acts of rape and domestic violence it’s not about playing victim or survival. It about treating the root cause and healing as a whole rather then just one person. It takes two to tango so to speak and in this case one event had a waterfall affect on an entire school and community."

ChronicPain,fgu1v4a,t1_fgtzvxh,1581112228.0,"Ugh I have those family members too. I’m so sorry. I can only imagine as I’m a woman but with how society holds men to such a high standard of strength to ever feel weak must be so difficult so I get how isolating feels like the only option. And I feel that too. I get flushed and red in the face whenever I’m confronted with the question of “what have you been up to?” By someone I haven’t seen or heard from in almost a decade, which leads to less and less trips out of the house. I hate the pitty in their eyes. I hate that I’ll likely never hear from them again but I’ll be a topic of conversation later. I only recently stopped going into any details, just a simple “oh not much, how about you?” Still got flushed and red but I felt a little better knowing it wasn’t an in detail explanation that really they don’t deserve or need. I too live in a small conservative town, I know a large amount of people so it’s tough. I want to move so badly."
ChronicPain,fgtxs7n,t1_fgtv60a,1581110839.0,"Thank you. That’s exactly why I’m still here. I have things to stick around for. I’ve gotten better at not focusing on it, I recently just had surgery so it’s made that tough. I’m sorry to all of us who’ve had to suffer this very invisible pain. I’m a grin and bear it type due to my upbringing and through therapy I’ve learned to be more present and allow it to flow more easily but there’s usually outside factors that are beyond my control that make it flair up. Driving being one. I used to love driving and in someways I still do especially if I have a destination to go see my sibling. But short trips to the doctors are sometimes huge set backs. I come home with shoulder tension that makes it seem like my heads going to pop off. I’m out for days after. My pain is the result of an MVA so dealing with even just lawyers alone is triggering not to mention the insurance company. In the province I’m in it’s a nightmare right now."
ChronicPain,fgtua8n,t1_fgsnsi6,1581109458.0,I cry. A lot. And see a therapist regularly. I sometimes spend days in bed. I’ve been at this for six years. I have extreme social anxiety so group therapy is too much. Talking here seems to help with the loneliness of it all. I don’t know how to wrap my head around it either. I tend to get overwhelmed thinking even a week ahead. As cliche as it sounds going day by day is really the only way I can function in any capacity.

They can’t ignore it forever. I strongly believe it’s older and even passed generations attitudes of suck it up that has a hand in creating this issue to begin with. I tend to hide my pain a lot out of shame and that makes things so much worse. I too am programmed to grin and bear it.

ChronicPain,fgs6qjs,t1_fgrxbtt,1581074256.0,"Yes. I had this issue as a teenager with both Advil and Tylenol. Back then I was treating pms symptoms. Now years later after an MVA, my doctor is one of those terrified of opioids and I basically just suffer. Sadly nothing has worked for me yet and at first Flexiril (not sure on spelling) helped but that too only effectively worked for a few weeks at best and can be harmful if taken long term. I personally have never experienced any tolerance decrease over time and at best I get maybe some relief but I find it hard to tell. I’ve been hospitalized with pain and morphine administered there and it only gave me mild relief. I have a very sensitive stomach as a result of my early days taking Tylenol so I’m very hesitant to take anything. I hate that I don’t have anything more helpful to contribute"
AnxietyDepression,fgs5bz9,t3_f07o24,1581072360.0,Talk to a pharmacist. Or several and then bring this to your doctors attention. I too have had problems arise from my GP prescribing meds they weren’t properly educated about. Pharmacist deal with these medications daily so they have the most up to date information. I hear you about wanting to be kind and helpful so simply just coming to your GP with information and having an honest conversation about your concerns is all you can do. I recently had to be blunt with my own doctor and it went surprisingly well.

CBD,fgi8nix,t3_eymto1,1580811399.0,"Consult your GP first! Especially about coming off the SSRI. Coming off these drugs can be awful if you don’t do it with help. I’ve made the switch but my mental health is far worse then what you’ve described. CBD is something I’ve wanted to do for a very long time as I also have awful side affects from pharmaceuticals. I’ve been at it now for a little over two months. 

 I can’t stress this part enough but please consult with  your doctor. Some are very unwilling to go this route but don’t get discouraged if they are. Depending on where you are in Canada there are lots of clinics available to aid in medically getting the dose right along side your GP without them having to be the prescribing doctor. 

I’ve personally gone through Greenleaf and had a very unwilling GP. It’s a bit of a process but it’s worth it because they give you lots of information and follow up but there are bi-annual fees (every 7 months) associated with having a medical cannabis prescription. 

With that being said: Anywhere that sells it should be fairly knowledgeable on what they sell and if you’ve never smoked or ingested any cannabis before you will want to start with a very low dose. Also please note as well that THC will always be present and anything advertising that there is 0% THC is likely not reputable or following the guidelines set out for legal sale. In Canada these products are supposed to be tested thoroughly if it’s a legal product. 

Hope this helps and good luck. There is lots of more detailed information on dosing available with a little light google research I’m sure but I would recommend dealing with your SSRI with your GP before trying this."

ChronicPain,fg7khsa,t1_fg6h2cs,1580594713.0,Don’t scratch what ever you do! Before I went to the doctor mine had spread in a nice big patch from my ribs under my right breast all around to my back. Get calomine lotion! That’s the only thing that gave me mild relief! It’s typically in a pink bottle. Try not to be offended if no one wants to touch you. It’s terrifying for anyone who doesn’t have it. It’s technically the dormant chicken pox virus coming out so anyone who has had them can get shingles and anyone who hasn’t is at risk of getting it. Specifically babies and elderly but pregnant women can also be at great risk because I don’t believe they can take the meds for treating it. When I got mine a first aid attendant touched it without gloves on and she also ended up with it. The doctor who diagnosed me wouldn’t even touch me with gloves on. I experienced nerve pain afterward that felt like I had it all over again for months after the rash left. I tried anticonvulsant drugs but had a bad reaction to them so I just had to suffer through it. I saw a naturopath after and she straightened me right out. I suffered from mild depression during this and after but her recommendations helped and set me right back up to succeed! It wasn’t cheap but it was worth it at the time. It wasn’t until 3 years later after a car accident where I developed ptsd and chronic pain and currently am reliving my nerve pain site due to a recent breast reduction where I feel the nerve pain now in my incisions. Now I’m suffering more then I would have had I not had shingles but who knows. I’m also super paranoid about blowing a stitch because of an old injury when I was a kid where I cut myself at my knee and it ripped open and I now have a big scar on my leg. I half regret doing the surgery because I normally do everything I can to avoid aggravating my pain and my neck and back had seized up just prior to going in for surgery and has done it twice since. I’m currently suffering with a seized neck and back and wasn’t able to get myself out of bed this morning. It’s a struggle. Thanks for letting me rant. I really hope you recover quickly from this! If you’ve caught it quickly you’ll suffer less. I still to this day get panicked the minute I see any kind of rash or pimple or anything around my trunk.
CPTSD,fg5y1tc,t1_fg5rb63,1580543869.0,"I’ve struggled back and forth with this idea. I’ve explored all kinds of things (media’s and ideas) and the majority of them never materialize. HOWEVER! I do not hate your answer. What I’ve started doing is just writing down as quickly as possible the idea if I can hold onto it long enough. I find a lot of the time I have the ideas but they don’t stick around long enough to even remember or put into action. I have yet to take an idea from this journal I’ve started but it’s a start in my mind. 

I would love it if you could elaborate on what you felt before you forced yourself to sit down and just do it? 

I too have experienced this relief by just having something completed in front of me but it was immediately followed with an aching back because if I’m honest I don’t know my own limits and at best I describe my pain in this way; I feel like a child trapped in a decrepit old persons body, twisted up with crippling arthritis. I want to do art but it takes a lot out of me physically and mentally I’m just not able to maintain focus."

CBD,fg1zxzz,t3_ewdsjr,1580435772.0,"I don’t know if this is medical grade or just recreationally used (self medicated) regardless no judgements here. Interestingly enough all CBD products contain Some level of THC, it’s false advertising to say a CBD oil has zero THC because ultimately CBD is an extract from the cannabis plant. Here in Canada they have to regulate and test products and label accordingly. I myself am a medical user and haven’t experienced a high ever but I have experienced a lack of consistency in products working effectively and have noticed lately that the bottles have a residue in the bottom....

Just a suggestion and also a question and something I’ve considered doing is vigorously shaking bottles before dosing myself, just to see if there is more consistency with each dose? Is this just a random dose mid bottle or is it a bottom of the bottle dose?

Edit. Didn’t see the other comments on this....repeat. Sorry"
ChronicPain,fg1yoyw,t1_fg1lvel,1580435219.0,Thank you I hope so as well. Mine stems from a car accident so it’s hard when I know what a before and after looks like for me. I have done everything suggested by multiple specialists and all I have is a chronic pain diagnoses and PTSD. So it’s something I guess but it feels like theres more to it then just those generalized diagnoses. It sounds like for the most part you have a good understanding of when your body is in pain and what generally works to relieve it and I hope that continues to work. I may be wrong but it sounds like the loss of your career must be the hardest part. To hear you’ve put so much effort into education for a career to have your body limit you from doing it seems heartbreaking to me. I too was about to embark on my education when I was struck by an 18 year old distracted on her phone.

I was deemed unstable and unreliable as a witness and the jackass got off on all charges. Even after his defence lawyer questioned me repeatedly about having another mental illness altogether which I corrected immediately. 

Having mental illness does not mean you are unreliable as a witness or undeserving of a fair trial. It means that the predator sitting in the court room used this to his advantage as a malleable easy target that he can abuse and likely get away with anything in a court of law because mentally ill people are considered unreliable in some judges eyes. Which he very much could have claimed PTSD was why he abused women and others for 20+ years of his 40 pathetic years life.

I’ve had every imaginable scan (that I’m aware of) and every time I have a complaint it’s never answered by any of the scans. One showed bulging discs and maybe a pinched nerve but the scan was so blurry to say for sure.

You’ve been conditioned into questioning your own truth so of course your answers are going to be riddled with doubt. Again, that’s a them problem and not a you problem. And sadly therapy can help with that but I will reserve that bit of advice because it honestly takes years. As to the text messages regarding therapy requests to your pos father, how disheartening to think those could be used against you. He’s on trial! Not you!!! Oh hunny I am in tears for you. I wish I could offer my shoulder for you to cry on. This stuff is heartbreakingly horrible. Here’s a few more little bit of information I’ve learned in therapy that might help;

Box breathing!!4 seconds in 4 seconds hold 4 -6 out and four to hold again. Repeat. At least three times. Do as often as you can. And breathe from the belly. Stick that sucker out and fill those lungs! 

CBT - this one is a lot to explain but google it and find a triangular chart that feels best to you, I’ve received a few different ones in therapy that never felt easily understood but I’ve found many on the internet that make more sense. Repeat this as often as you can but do not beat yourself up if you don’t find it useful or successful at first. Try writing it out in a chart style and doing as many different scenarios as you can. Like anything practice brings improvement! And this also takes time. 

Epson Salt baths or just a bath. Do everything you can to relax!! Meditate and often and for like 2 minutes if you can’t stand it at first! Try an app called Insight Timer! They have short guided meditations to follow! 

Please send updates! You always have a place to vent and talk here!"
CPTSD,feno26h,t3_epyre0,1579288451.0,"I respect and believe you! Remember this regardless of what anyone else says. You are doing the right thing by standing up against him. My heart goes out to you, I’ve testified against an abuser and it didn’t go the way I thought I wanted it to go. I wanted him to pay. I wanted him to be locked away. Before trial and before I even went to the cops I didn’t want this. Strange I’m sure but I also understood he was also very sick. Hurt people, hurt people... Jail just becomes a place for them to work on being better at hurting people. This is just my opinion. I believe in your case he should 100% not be aloud around children so thank you for thinking of potentially new victims and taking a stand. I am so sorry you were ever made to believe you made anything up. People sometimes have a hard time seeing the evil in the world for what it is and it’s easier to believe the opposite of that truth. This is a them problem, not a you problem. Be selfish with your time, take lots of time to yourself, don’t be afraid to speak up and take breaks if YOU need them. I powered through my testimony and felt extreme relief when it was over but also extreme defeat when I was told he’d been acquitted due to police error and inconsistency in my testimony because having to face him was completely destabilizing for me. If you feel any of that, ASK FOR A BREAK! collect yourself and try again! No one will hold this against you.

There is another to consider here as well, Mother Nature herself! Which of all religious communities I feel pagan and aboriginal of any kind respect and pay tribute to the most! With that said I would imagine if something was to become unavailable we all would adapt and main stream markets wouldn’t probably even flinch. 

Mother Earth I believe has lessons to teach as well which we ultimately have no control over other then to respect her and not damage that relationship by way of things like packaging.

Teaching people to cherish what they have now with respect to where it came from and change how they go about their practice in the future is important in my opinion. I sought out a First Nations woman to teach me. Reach out and giving these marginalized cultures a platform is important to prevent cultural destruction as well as the tools and materials they use for ritual. I treasure all of the information and tools I have gathered and done a great deal of research into both sides of the argument and personally I don’t believe in everything I read. 

Edit ( I don’t believe everything I read online, because I had a school teacher as a mother and I regretfully admit I am becoming her 🙈)"
Wicca,fekm7he,t1_fekkedf,1579202956.0,"I know and I’m sorry I was combative in anyway. Full moon had me bugging out. There is definitely a lot to this subject. I’m from Canada and was taught by First Nations the ritual of smudging but I felt called to make it my own after. I had no idea the appropriation that occurs else where in the world just around the word smudging and I will definitely be holding our local natural health and foods stores accountable for their products now as this is clearly a global issue and not just local. Even though I would never buy from some of the company’s you sourced in you video as examples of what not to do (I stay away from big box stores as it is) not every health food store is automatically ethically sourced either, doing your research locally is important as well. Looking forward to palo santo video! Again well done. We are all only as accountable as the individual research we can do with what we have in our hands before we support with our money!! Blessed be! Education is key!"
Wicca,fekjmlc,t3_epl5dl,1579201422.0,Thank you for doing the research. Video is well done.
ChronicPain,feffh50,t3_eofpfj,1579055217.0,I feel like adding extra pain on a regular scale of 1-10 question on those forms. This is great! Thanks for sharing!

ptsd,feedqww,t1_feecily,1579031657.0,"What whoa, no?! Sounds a bit far fetched so maybe that’s why he didn’t believe in it. Technically they target the chemicals in the brain, but I meant to say psychiatrists are one of the very few specialists who don’t actually LOOK or take scans of the organ they treat. Which seems WILD to me. I watched a TED talk I believe where a guy saved his nephew from a life on these meds and worse because he actually scanned his brain and found a tumour, had he not had an uncle who was a doctor he would have likely been put in a mental institution until he died. I also had no idea the dangers of Advil and Tylenol when I was young! I developed ulcers at a young age also due to neglect and stress but obviously tons of this stuff didn’t help. They severely hurt my stomach now any time I take them, which doesn’t help having chronic pain. Meds numbed me right out, I also couldn’t take NSAIDS on them either. Double screwed. Smdh."
ptsd,feecq6o,t1_fee2cio,1579031059.0,"Well said. I’ve definitely had 1 out 4 specialists I’ve seen say one thing and it’s made me personally question myself, even though I’m in some level of pain daily and had been previously diagnosed with chronic pain after PTSD. Before I even saw the guy I looked at his reviews and saw an overwhelming number of people reporting him being dismissive, so go figure. But do you think I’ll likely ever forget his comment? Sigh"
ptsd,feec0sr,t1_feeb9dp,1579030647.0,Absolutely. Pharmaceuticals treat symptoms not the actual problem. Not to mention the negative side affects. Maybe this will be different. What I’ve never understood is the lack of looking at the actual organ psychiatrist treat. I’m not a doctor but that seems like shooting a fish in a dark barrel...with your eyes closed.
myfavoritemurder,febs8p4,t3_eo4h5z,1578962100.0,They’ve made such impactful statements in their work.  Love MFM
witchcraft,fe62wor,t1_fe62flo,1578880571.0,Absolutely! I did a deep cleaning and found things after I’d done my original burn and once I added it to the box I immediately noticed a sense of relief after feeling disappointed that my original burn left me feeling like something was missing. It’s just a standard legal file box but I’ve painted it and put a protection spell on it to seal the contents within until I can deal with them properly at a later date. Or whenever I feel my energy start to stagnate.
Wicca,fe5ywwq,t3_enuuui,1578878035.0,This is amazing! Thank you for sharing 😍
witchcraft,fe5jbx0,t3_enmm11,1578870145.0,I have a “Burn Box” that I’ve done something very similar to this with! I love that you shared this! I add to the burn box anything that I can’t just throw away and honestly I feel like I have more to do. I thought I had gotten all the gunk out but this has given me so many more ideas. Thank you!! The box is just a temporary place I put things to remove them immediately. Then I burn them ceremoniously in a big bonfire during a full moon.
Crystals,fdzs6wb,t3_encqx2,1578794543.0,Beautiful!!
witchcraft,fdpum7u,t1_fdpp62f,1578641142.0,Thank you for writing this. It’s both enlightening and reaffirming of how I have been coming to understand my own mental health struggles recently. I immediately clicked on this post and I too feel teary eyes and warm inside. I’m both relieved and saddened but grateful to feel alone because I’m really not alone at all.
CPTSD,fdp4wss,t1_fdnicnr,1578620071.0,"Oof, wow thank you. I too crave physical touch but don’t like being touched mostly due to trauma. It seems so backwards...Glad to know I’m not alone in this."
AnxietyDepression,fdohyee,t3_emedhb,1578605510.0,"Just be honest. What you are experiencing is real. Trust your intuition, if something doesn’t feel right it’s likely not. Don’t be afraid to speak up and advocate for yourself. You have parents that care for you as they are obviously here for you and many parents would just let their kids go on without ever addressing the situation. I know it may feel like you are about to be punished but you have people who care and want the best for you and I know from having been in similar situations that they just want what’s best for you. Even if they don’t know what exactly that is. School systems aren’t designed to fit everyone. What works for one doesn’t work necessarily for another and that’s okay."
ptsd,fdoaqcz,t3_emapgp,1578601809.0,"I’ve had Physio specialists say before asking me anything or really having any concept of who I was “Has anyone ever told you you are okay?”  And then proceeded to do his full medical examination on me after a brief interview where I told him I had recently been assaulted. I cried the entire time. With a female secretary in the room. (I’ve seen multiple male doctors prior none who had a “witness” come in during an exam) I was in extreme musculoskeletal pain and he ignored all my recoil as he moved my body to test my range of motion. He later told my lawyer ( I was in for a legal medical assessment) that he would not write a report because I was inconsolable and unresponsive even though I answered all of his questions, and that there was nothing physically wrong. What he did get right was that I was suffering physiological distress, which was not his area of expertise. Clearly. His stupid exclamation that I was perfectly okay haunts me still. I want to be okay but fight flight and freeze is all I know. It was a totally triggering event and I still to this day get terrifying dreams about male doctors. I refuse to see any male doctors going forward. Doctors/EMT/police are just people. They aren’t super human. They are just as susceptible to being stupid, ignorant and disgusting or all three or worse even with taking sworn oaths to serve and protect. They too can be monsters hiding in plain sight. I’m grateful for your courage to speak about your experiences. Thank you.

Edit: I should note I had been assaulted just prior to this appointment which had been scheduled due to a prior MVA which fully triggered my own PTSD."

ArtistLounge,fdl9v5q,t1_fdl7lx8,1578519523.0,"Haha word vomit fear is real!  Thank you for expressing that first of all! Secondly, that’s a wonderful explanation and again thank you for clarifying. 

 I wasn’t seeing the con being conversation abbreviated and more the “long con” like an “Oceans” movie plot line giving it a more sinister/criminal feel? Just my initial thoughts but obviously now this makes sense. 

Please word vomit about critical authority (in my mind that would be baby boomers) and what “real” art is. Personally to me art is whatever the artist and viewer/consumer says it is. And are we talking on a career level (starving artist vs successful artist) and what that means as well?"
ArtistLounge,fdl67ks,t1_fdksj07,1578517732.0,Yes this! Couldn’t have said it better myself!!
ArtistLounge,fdl34fo,t1_fdkvcvy,1578516243.0,"I guess off the top of my head could you explain the name of the magazine in some detail? I’m curious where the inspiration for the title came from. 

And are you getting a reasonable amount of traffic? 

DM might be a better form to communicate but I think these are the most broad questions everyone may benefit from knowing the answers to."
astrology,fdl2le7,t1_fdl0wfc,1578515993.0,Sooo I guess that would mean that it’s very individualized as well. Hmm interesting. Thanks for sharing that! I’ve always been upset when someone refers to me as a millennial. Maybe more so when it’s in a negative light.

depression,fdksexo,t1_fdjzrj3,1578510182.0,"Jokes aside, wasteful as well! But I also am guilty of the shower so long it turns cold and you’re literally and figuratively frozen. So yes depression sucks. For everyone."
depression,fdkr1lj,t3_elpxkm,1578509365.0,"This could be the result of parents saying “Stop crying or I will give you something to cry about” or “Big girls/boys don’t cry” or any dismissive neglectful behaviour realized or not. However, that may have also been their upbringing as well so before you start blaming mom and dad for this, try to be kind. As kind as you need to be for yourself! First! Neglect is still neglect even if it’s completely unconscious. I feel your pain of needing to bottle up emotions and almost a denial that anything is wrong but yet you feel it. You know something is not right. Trust that. It’s likely just because you were never shown that feelings (good, bad and ugly) are all normal and perfectly okay to express. When you don’t have examples in early development of healthy emotional expression, it can have negative impacts later in life. We as humans need to express and release our emotions or it becomes a festering train wreck of confusion and pain. And in this case also guilt. What you are feeling is okay. Get out as much as you can. It takes time. You may be literally reparenting yourself. Therapy can be very beneficial in helping you make a lasting change. Best of luck! Be kind to yourself and don’t hesitate to reach out when you feel a desire to express ALL your feelings. You are not a burden!"
astrology,fdkowvm,t1_fdk1ofv,1578508097.0,These dates also range and change from source to source. My mom (born in 64’) refuses to accept she’s a boomer but now everything makes more sense! Still frustrated just confirmed that it’s not just me. Thank you for sharing
ptsd,fdij7wh,t3_elghj0,1578444128.0,Definitely consider going to therapy for yourself too! I know you want to help him but you are dead right about not being able to force a horse lead to water to drink. Sometimes leading by example is the way to start small. If you equip yourself with ways to cope with what you are also going through then it will be easier on both of you. I’ve had to get very frank with my loved ones when they suggest “just getting out of bed” or something else that is realistic to someone not suffering with PTSD. It’s a hard thing to have to do but abusing alcohol takes a tole on not just him but you as well obviously as you aren’t able to live with him. I know he’s important to you but you should also be important in this as well. Take care! I wish both of you nothing but the best!

depression,fdfn7ci,t1_fdedpes,1578365587.0,"Yes saying nothing is better then saying something hurtful or something you don’t actually mean. What’s her dad doing in all of this? Not pointing fingers but I bet both daughter and mother are equally scared he could die due to stress of any kind but is he eating healthy and is it just old age and genetics? 

Sorry I’ve had friends tell their parents they’ve hated them and then they were killed 20 minutes later by a drunk driver soooo... some things are truly out of our control but our words are always in our control and it sounds like the mother in this case is very afraid to loose her husband, and isn’t using her words to explain that in a way that’s helpful to anyone."
