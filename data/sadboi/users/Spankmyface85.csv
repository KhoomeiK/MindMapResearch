You make a very good point in that my life is just work, AA and sporadic meetings with still drinking/using friends. I find it hard in social situations to relax as I was always out of it before to cope.

I think I'm scared to socialise outside of AA incase I am put in a position where drink might come up. 

What is the website meet up? Did you find figuring out what your interests were (outside of drinking) hard in the beginning? It's like that was my whole life and now I'm sober I've no idea who I am or what I like."
