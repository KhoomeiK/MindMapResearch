jmu,fr1fmpm,t3_gm1486,1589818887.0,I think phase two (June 10th) in Virginia includes the reopening of the gyms with 50% capacity.
jmu,fqynbmh,t3_gln4ek,1589751380.0,"The deadline for the Housing Accommodation process for 2020-2021 for returning students was February 14, 2020. The deadline for new students is June 19, 2020.
If they do let you sign the contract, You’ll probably get space, East don’t fill up as quickly as Bluestone."
jmu,fqvv5e8,t1_fqvv4gy,1589685893.0,Russia :)
jmu,fqvmwm5,t1_fqvlpxw,1589680655.0,I mean it’s a valid point but walking to Walmart from Devon lane would take me 40 minutes in humidity while riding a bike would take me 20 :)
jmu,fqjuq1a,t1_fqjuhw8,1589415480.0,"Some Geneds were always offered online, but there is usually also in person classes in addition. When it comes to classes specific to your major it’s usually in person classes and some random online classes... sorry, it just made me panic"
jmu,fqjp8we,t3_gj6w37,1589413203.0,"It might be specific to your major. I have no online classes whatsoever, looked up other majors and they all seem to have an in campus location."
jmu,fqbib94,t1_fqbi8tc,1589237512.0,You meant to say all colleges but still said JMU specifically.
jmu,fqbhgwd,t3_ghxak1,1589237060.0,Yeah because in other colleges students obviously don’t do any of that
jmu,fq8dno6,t1_fq8bj4k,1589163837.0,Yeah it’s not really about you only though..? Some of us are stuck in bad households and care about something more than just “rocknrolling” through classes...?
jmu,fpm57j2,t1_fpm54yg,1588725807.0,"I did but I am not sure that everyone is getting it. The cares act only talks about pell grant students getting financial help but again, I’m not sure about that..."
jmu,fpm52ql,t1_fpm51ep,1588725727.0,Which one?
jmu,fpm4cu2,t3_ge963y,1588725306.0,"It doesn’t really seem like a source that guarantees that we all will get something, all the information that was sent out was really vague"
jmu,fpiywus,t1_fpiysyk,1588652087.0,Thank you so much! I thought I was the only one who was kind of confused with the really vague email they sent out haha
jmu,fphmljx,t3_gdgiei,1588623943.0,It does. I’m on campus rn
jmu,fp6vrm9,t3_gbldqm,1588359433.0,It will only be there for 14 days then they send it back. Ship to your friends address who’s still in hburg and ask him to pick it up
jmu,fozepj6,t3_gadk9e,1588189412.0,You can call them and ask them to forward it to your home address
BPD,fox3mhz,t3_g9ygk4,1588133277.0,I know what you feel like. For me it’s just running away but with no particular place where. Just disappearing
jmu,fo1qn5y,t1_fo1qj17,1587439228.0,Thank you so much! I absolutely agree that it’s a wonderful program it was just a little bit frustrating for me when I firstly enrolled in class! (I dropped it the first week of last semester so I went to a couple of classes) and thank you so much for your advice ! :)
BPD,fny3zwd,t3_g4l4z1,1587352854.0,"He probably broke up because bpd gets in your head and makes you do really irrational and impulsive things. so judging by his current behavior and the fact that he tries to keep talking, I think he regrets what he did and I doubt he would lose feelings over one comment. I am sorry for overexplaining lol but yeah I think it was just an irrational behavior that bpd causes. I advise that you talk to him about his and yours feelings and your relationship"
BPD,fnq9fjo,t3_g37inw,1587160237.0,I really like to hold everything under my control starting from smallest things like which side of the bed I want to sleep on and if it doesn’t go according to scenario in my head I’m extremely uncomfortable and unfocused :\
BPD,fnq985o,t3_g38y2a,1587160122.0,"I don’t either but it’s just because I’m not that easy to offend or make me upset. I get extremely angry in situations when I’m really triggered which I think is normal. Don’t really react with anger to everything and even if something does make me mad I hold it in most of the times cause i realize that I can’t just let my rage out on the person who didn’t do anything wrong, it’s just my inner fears and insecurities etc..."
BPD,fnnb0g4,t3_g2sk6f,1587088312.0,"I’ve been in a more or less stable relationship for 3 months now, without me going absolutely crazy like before in other relationships cause I eventually learned a lot from my mistakes. I think staying in a relationship is hard and it requires some hard work both from and you and your partner (!). I advise sharing with you partner what’s on your mind and let them know you never mean to hurt them but your disorder makes you feel like everyone is against you and they hate you etc (or whatever you’re experiencing). But it is certainly possible and worth it. Just takes time and certain coping skills"
BPD,fnjzxh8,t1_fnjzw0e,1587011092.0,I feel a horrible need in treatment that I can’t get right now as well. Please take care of yourself
BPD,fnjuvei,t3_g260r9,1587007541.0,"I was on seroquel when I was misdiagnosed with bipolar. It DOESNT work for BPD in most people, can’t remember where I read about it but it is not meant for people with BPD (you could probably google that) cause it is a crazy serious medication. Seroquel messes me up really badly"
BPD,fnjnsee,t1_fnjnqzn,1587002909.0,I appreciate that so much. Have a great night and take care!
BPD,fnjnj6d,t1_fnjndqp,1587002746.0,"I was sadly misdiagnosed for few months and stopped seeing psychiatrists because of that but I believe therapy would really help. Sadly, no resources right now.... I will have to look around again though."
BPD,fnjn5a8,t1_fnjmyd0,1587002502.0,"That’s what I’ve just started learning about honestly, I had no idea until I saw another post where someone was feeling that disconnection between feelings / thoughts that just happened. I am just frustrated because it happens so often now and I just go in and out of it within 20-40 minutes so I was questioning this state. And thank you for remarking that"
BPD,fnifeo2,t1_fnif6fk,1586979065.0,This is almost exactly what I’m thinking in moments like this too!! It doesn’t necessarily happen when I’m upset but if I am it is a brighter and more exaggerated feeling I would say
BPD,fniejar,t3_g1xfoq,1586978649.0,"I always feel like my problems aren’t bad enough to talk about them and that I really should shut up about it... so yes, a feeling of “lying” persists because I feel like it is not actually bad, just a normal thing that happens to everyone.  I think it might be kind of similar to what you experience."
BPD,fnie6uv,t3_g1y75q,1586978484.0,"I haven’t experienced it to the point that other people may be describing it (loss of memory etc) but I do have a slight form of it, like feeling disconnected/spacey enough to kind of stop comprehending the world around you. For me the surroundings sometimes get almost distorted (not physically but... I just lose the feeling that I’m in a real space) and my body becomes lighter. But just for a few seconds and I’m usually able to drag myself back in reality. Even if you don’t get that it is in no way a reason to invalidate your BPD. It’s just different for everyone."
jmu,fnhwbee,t3_g1vk29,1586969934.0,"I had a class like this and I had it at one time on Mondays and different time on Wednesday, I think it’s the same for you (Monday 2.30 and Wed 4.30)"
BPD,fnhkaa5,t3_g1rw1b,1586963967.0,I have this too. I feel like I can tell right away what the person is about and whether or not I can connect to them. Also feel above them because oh I am so much more interesting and special. I definitely see and know more than other people. It’s  a weird feeling but I also think it’s connected to the narcissistic nature of bpd in some people.
BPD,fngcutb,t1_fngcrl0,1586928404.0,Lmao same
BPD,fngavdc,t3_g1hrud,1586926787.0,I just had it today. Had like a 20-minute crying session and then just started laughing 5 minutes later and just taking care of stuff etc even though I felt like I was barely able to stand up while I was crying and wishing death upon me
BPD,fnc0mqx,t3_g0puu9,1586826129.0,"I get that too. It’s an internal grief for me, grief for nothing and being so mad and wanting to be left alone. I started calming down in a few hours but something triggered me and set me off to storm out of my boyfriends room with an absolute inadequate reaction
I also can’t cry sometimes for some reason even though i want to"
BPD,fn5v8sb,t3_fzrk8b,1586677084.0,"I get that all the time. It is an uncertain feeling of wanting someone’s presence but wanting to be alone and isolated from them at the same time. What soothes this feeling a bit as if me and my partner stay in different rooms but I still know he’s there. 
I even get that in companies of friends too. Random impulses to just disappear when nothing really should trigger that, just wanting to suddenly be out coming out of nowhere..."
BPD,fn5p3c3,t3_fzit1a,1586671201.0,Yes yes yes!!!! Didn’t know it might have been a BPD thing. I started crying and getting so frustrated and upset once when we were talking about his childhood.
jmu,fkcwi9v,t3_fhrg5z,1584062773.0,I have to so yes.
jmu,fkbkmrx,t3_fhjtzr,1584034743.0, Facebook group of Residence Life just posted an update: You can get your things starting 10 am on Saturday but if you’re planning to stay in your dorm you can’t return until Sunday!
jmu,fkbjyqm,t3_fhjtzr,1584034389.0,My Hall director in Gifford said 10 am but it initially was 12 pm so I’m a bit confused too.
jmu,fk8boqm,t1_fk8bnx5,1583953057.0,Not yet
jmu,fk86snc,t3_fh1bce,1583950429.0,Nope
jmu,fk85f4q,t1_fk855v6,1583949692.0,"I absolutely agree, I don’t have any opportunity to go back home right now (My family isn’t in the states atm)  and if I don’t, I will have to somehow figure out a place to live and the way to eat, I lose my job as well cause I work on campus. Like what am I supposed to do, I’m sure I’m not the only person who’s concerned about the place to LIVE, especially considering JMU has like ~500 international students"
jmu,fk7zpun,t1_fk7znwb,1583946641.0,I’m a theater major so I feel you.. the whole purpose of acting is in practice...
