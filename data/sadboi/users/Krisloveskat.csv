EatingDisorders,fjsb8ns,t3_feu1e7,1583595329.0,"Are you in the in the U.S. ?  Because I am quite confused by the statement that there is only one treatment center???
But I truly applaud you for fighting for care. Others who don’t fight for care never get it and it is not their job to do that and that fact makes me very sad. Keep up the fight, you have many people cheering  for you!"
transED,fjs1dei,t3_fe88en,1583592738.0,"I honestly don’t know exactly how I identify, but the purpose of my post is to let everyone know that I am an activist and advocate for people who identify on LGBTQ+ spectrum and have eating disorders. I have been working in this field for about 6 yrs. I am not a therapist nor doctor. I am simple a queer, gender non conforming human who had to suffer with anorexia for 20 yrs due to how I presented and the fact I wasn’t well off.
After almost dying for a second time I swore I wouldn’t let anyone from my community go through what I did, and this is what I have done 

If any of you get to the point where you need to go into inpatient or residential eating disorder treatment please let me know.  I have put many treatment centers through a rigorous test to assure the safety and effectiveness for the LGBTQ+ clients.

I charge absolutely nothing, I just want to make sure EVERYONE gets the treatment they need with dignity and respect."
EatingDisorders,fjnq7qv,t3_fef50e,1583512450.0,"I am sure you don’t know me, but I have been an Activist/Advocate for LGBTQ+ identifying people with eating disorders for quite sometime. Actually I founded and ran a nonprofit all on my own, Mira Alto Foundation, that’s purpose was to vet all residential and inpatient Eating Disorder Facilities to make sure they new how to properly care for this group of people and that it was done with dignity and respect.
You would think this wouldn’t be necessary in 2020, but we have a long way to go!
Unfortunately I had to shut Mira Alto Foundation down due to lack of funds and broken promises.
Just contact me if you need help!"
EatingDisorders,fi7ku9l,t3_f6r2yb,1582223274.0,"I have been working as an Activist/Advocate mainly for people who identify on the LGBTQ+ spectrum, but also for those who don’t fit the antiquated Stereotype type.for 6 years now. So many of us have tried to make this happen. But when it came time to actually implement such a thing, either they didn’t have time or the budget didn’t did not account for it.
I am willing to do what I can if you trust me. Please contact me."
EatingDisorders,fhyalu5,t1_fhwapi5,1581972031.0,"I love your spirit and you are doing incredible, but at some point in time you will have to lose the word “diet” from your vocabulary. There are no good foods and there are no bad foods! You must eventually learn everything is fine in moderation. I know you might not be there yet, but keep this in mind. I am so proud of you!"
EatingDisorders,fe571no,t3_enm5k9,1578866208.0,"I used to run a nonprofit that vetted treatment centers for LGBTQ clients. That might not fit you, but with more info about yourself I and yourself ?I would gladly help you.  This is what I do.  The nonprofit I founded and ran was called .Mira Alto Foundation.
I wish you luck, this is a big decision."

EatingDisorders,f9iirvn,t1_f8uobsz,1575338154.0,If he doesn’t get help realize he faces the chance of dying. I don’t sugar coat the harsh reality of eating disorders. You might have to sound like a bit of a bad guy to get the point across. You could be saving his life.
EatingDisorders,f8tyugd,t3_e1w97i,1574814712.0,"First, good for you for fighting your demon. Does your friend’s parents/ guardians know about his issue? If not, step one is to either get him to tell them , his doctor or trusted adult. Talk to him about this. I don’t know what type of eating disorder he has, but it could be deadly. After he takes this step, the hardest, scariest step, hopefully he will be able to walk the road of recovery with you!"
EatingDisorders,f8b95l1,t1_f8b0tk3,1574430885.0,"Just want to clear up one point. ED’s do have a genetic component, but are not be ANY means a sole factor of  developing an eating disorder, there are behavioral and environmental components as well. I am sure that didn’t help you feel better, but wouldn’t you rather hear the truth?"

EatingDisorders,exj825o,t1_exidd7i,1566344029.0,That is absolutely not true. I had anorexia for 20+ years and have completely rid of it for almost 6. If you don’t believe me take a look at the study Mass General did.
