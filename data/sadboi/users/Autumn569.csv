AskReddit,fazpg8m,t1_fazn84x,1576418381.0,"I told the doctor that I need something to focus and some of my friends have recommended Ritalin. After asking me some questions he agreed to write me the Ritalin along with sertraline. I took 5mg Ritalin at first n didn't work, six hours later I took 10mg n didn't work. I told the doctor n took 15 mg n didn't work. I was so anxious about my medicine exams, I even started thinking of snorting 30 mg but the doctor warned me not to snort. I told him that this time I'll try swallowing 30 mg today. I took 3 pills n I felt my heartbeat fastening n getting dizzy  but it didn't really affect my concentration on studying despite feeling a little more alerted n less anxious."
