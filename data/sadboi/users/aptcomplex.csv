It seems it really struck a nerve with this community. I don't think OP was calling everyone bad, but the mindset regarding advice posts on this sub. A lot of the time lower ranked players are much more self righteous than higher ranks and often take themselves too seriously. I have been hardstuck low gold and now I'm high diamond. When I was gold I convinced myself it was everyone else but myself, I didn't think I belonged in gold and was always upset at the game when it all really boiled down to me not being good and being in the elo I belong in. Don't really understand the animosity in this post.

So I came home at 11pm after being out with a friend. I'm 20 btw, in college but on winter break atm. She was supposed to drive me to a surgery today and pick me up. Since it was under anesthesia I needed the ride. I told her I was anxious when I came home bc she was still up. I was really shaken up to the point where I felt like I was going to die if I had the procedure. Got yelled at so I just went to my room and cried and went to bed. This morning I woke up and got yelled at again for being abusive towards her. Last night was maybe a 5-10 minute interaction. I didn't yell once. This morning she told me she has more important things to do and refuses to drive me to the hospital. I end up having to call asking if I can uber there and back or somehow drive myself. They say no and I have to reschedule. Mom comes home and yells at me because I made this ""all her fault"" and tells me to get the fuck out of her life. (:

AmItheAsshole,fccj0ry,t3_egwqp2,1577598951.0,"I'm leaning more NTA but slightly ESH. NTA because I don't think people realize how expensive a 1tb pro is, and how expensive a repair would be. The ipad itself would cost ~$1700 for just the device, if you don't have apple care it would cost ~$700-1000 for the screen repair alone, not to mention any other damages they caused. Another thing being if you go to replace the screen and apple doesn't offer you a replacement they either send it out or keep it for a few DAYS. This means you are losing profit by not being able to work. The reason why its ESH is because a payment plan sounds like a reasonable alternative and instead of dropping thousands on court fees/lawyers you could just have her do a payment plan at any store that sells this."

You're just setting yourself up for resentment.  Reading this actually frustrated me because if my mom had this mindset when I was in high school I wouldn't have tried at all, and probably worked my ass off to save for the anticipation of being kicked out. Instead, she wanted me to focus on school and things I liked, and now I have a full scholarship to my college. I have a job, and pay for internet at my house, as well as my car stuff (gas, repairs, etc). This isn't because my mom forced me to, but because I didn't have to be worried about my mom calling me a freeloader, and having a good trusting relationship to the point where I chose to help with paying stuff like the internet. Maybe focus on have a good relationship with your kid instead of focusing on how you're going to drain money out of them the second they turn 18..
