ExPentecostal,fr1zo6x,t3_gm6h3u,1589828663.0,"Yes. I lead sunday school ministry and I've had a friend who keeps bringing up the kids. Before I actually left but the pastor pretty much knew I was leaving he preached a message pointed at me and made sure to mention that I was dragging my own children against their will to hell with me. My sisters mom wont let her hangout with me because the pastors wife told them not to let her. This was the first year I didnt get to be with her on her birthday.

 I know it's difficult. They are gonna do anything and everything to make you feel bad. Just stand your ground. You have no control over who does and does not follow you and that's not your responsibility."

ExPentecostal,fr02jdu,t3_glunxv,1589781849.0,I have been told non-stop since I left that I'm not supposed to seek sources outside of what pentecost teaches because they are teaching false doctorines and they've confused me which is the only reason I left. If they are so sure they are correct and everyone else is wrong then they would they be so afraid of outside sources.
Christianity,fqzfujp,t3_glrlpz,1589766485.0,"My husband goes to his family when we are having problems and complains about me to them. Because they've only known me for a short while with little face to face contact this really skewed their perception of me and did not give me a chance to leave a good impression.

They now dislike me and there's nothing I can say or do to change that. If you are having problems and need to vent it needs to be to someone who already knows them well enough for their perception not to be skewed by it like his parents, siblings, or friends. I know that doesnt sound as comfortable but as someone who has been on the other end of this it hurts when someone does this and it's difficult to trust again when it's been done to you."

ExPentecostal,fqy1ztk,t1_fqy19uy,1589741295.0,Well even IF he were to get a divorce flings are unhealthy methods of coping. Probably best to just stay away from women in general until he finds himself.

I never felt comfortable inviting people to the church because it was such an unhealthy environment for people to come to God.

I'm going to hopefully be looking for a denomination (or non) that aligns with how I believe Jesus would want us to live and serve."

This is completely spot on. The love and acceptance factor was the biggest problem I always had with the church. Once I found flaws in the core doctorine it just sealed the deal for me.

I have no one except this reddit thread and that was a big mistake on my part cause I've been suffering for it."

ExPentecostal,fqos2p9,t3_gk0vab,1589523196.0,"Hey sis I just left about a week ago. If you want to message me feel free to. 

I haven't been doing too good and I would attribute it mainly to not making sure I had someone to reach out to. I've felt very alone so if you have a friend or someone outside of the church you can talk openly with about it make sure you stay close to them.

I left over doctorinal issues. I think I still believe in God but the largest issue I had was I genuinely believe the strict standards is idolatry. You will not find any biblical scholars that support these interpretations of the passages. Which means they are following man not Jesus and man is making himself the arbiter of heaven or hell. This is the opposite of what Jesus teaches so it's good to get an understanding of how the scholars interpret the meanings of these passages. 

It really took the fog away when I realized there is only two common interpretations of deuteronomy 22:5 and neither one imply women should only wear a skirt all the time."
askphilosophy,fqoah9s,t3_gjywjp,1589510954.0,"The only one I've heard is the argument that you have no idea what kind of life the baby will live. They could be the person who fixes the world or cures cancer.

I personally think there is a very strong moral argument to be had in the case of deciding if others should have children in order to purposefully extinct the human race but I have no problem if someone decides for themselves not to have children.

I find anti-natalism to be somewhat of a result of nihilism, as a naturally nihilistic person we need to keep in mind not everybody believes life is meaningless. The very fact there are people who think life is worth living we need to tread carefully when deciding if our opinions overrule others."

Starting over sucks. It's all about taking one day at a time and finding something that can inspire us. I went and got a 360Â° camera just so I can have an excuse to get out of my house and go places. 

I got fired from my job and on top of it developed feelings for someone I can never be with. I cant bring myself to get up or do my homework. Even getting up to get my kids fed is an absolute hassle.

ExPentecostal,foc40l6,t1_foc1x3m,1587666854.0,"My husband grew up and breathes pentecost. He is probably the most judgemental person in the church constantly commenting on how hes never hear me spoke in tongues and how I don't pray enough even though I read and study my bible everyday and he only opens it when he is in front of people.

Yes my Aunt is a therapist and I've been thinking about starting with talking to her, She's Buddhist which is irrelevant but I think she'd be a good place to start. I just didn't want to come out to my family until I knew without a doubt I was leaving because they already don't like the church.

My kids are 6 and 2. The oldest one loves going but literally only to play games with other kids. They don't really have much of an understanding of what is going on there because it's all they've known. He has friends at school who play sports and he has said he wants to be in them with his friends. The holidays were rough too, his teacher was really cool about it but I basically told her we don't celebrate though I couldn't care less if he participated and she went out of her way to be overly accommodating and sensitive to shut down their ""Christmas party"" and instead make it a winter party. He ended up in the library on Halloween hanging out with the librarian while all his friends got to watch the costume parade. It broke my heart to know his first year of school he was basically excluded from everything all in the name of religiosity."
