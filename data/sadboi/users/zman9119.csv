Even though they had multiple signs all over the place stating you have to wear masks, no one was wearing one nor were their employees or any other PPE except for what basically looked like food-grade gloves. No other checks or questions. 

Did the blood draw and was out the door in about 15-minutes (they had issues with entering some of my other test codes and blew the vein halfway through the draw so they had to do a second stick which was fine and am used to as I have lab work every 6-weeks, hence why it took longer).
