AsianParentStories,fqre1qt,t1_fpx11cx,1589582537.0,"I think Asian moms weren't built with the ""thank you for thinking of me"" which seems to be installed in other moms across the world. My mom is similar in her reaction to gifts so I quit participating in the mother's day show altogether.  Of course, when I stopped, that's when she says ""It's Mother's day but you didn't get me anything..."" -\_-"
AsianParentStories,fqrdfgc,t1_fq5zv05,1589582188.0,"I find it easier to disregard the swarm of Mother's Day pictures by questioning people's intentions behind posting declarations of love for their mom on a platform she most likely doesn't even use. It's just everyone saying, ""look at me- I love my mom, and therefore am a decent child/human being."" That's my cynical take on it. The fact that we designate a day to be intentional in our gratitude for mothers is...beyond me.

Most people I know would never admit they have a rocky relationship with their mom, (in fear/out of shame that it would deem them as an ungrateful or an altogether shitty human being) despite the fact that they indeed DO have a rocky relationship with their mom. This sucks, because sometimes those people unintentionally gaslight us for feeling the way we do (my friends have said, ""but your mom is so nice to me, she can't be that bad"") and then we start thinking we're the problem, when...in some situations...our mom is the toxic one.

I believe if we were more honest about our relationships with our parents, you wouldn't feel so sad and alone in your experience!

Long story short, I also don't feel close with my mom and every interaction is forced. I can't remember ever joking with her, or experiencing a typical ""mother-daughter"" relationship. As I've grown older, I've met healthier female role models who I consider mother figures, which suffices. You're not alone! <3"
Hmong,fpqiq8r,t1_fppy115,1588823728.0,Agreed. stay six feet away and definitely dont touch us
AmItheAsshole,fplo1ri,t1_fpll6vj,1588716223.0,"Yoo...this is EXACTLY what it is. 🙌🏽

Yeah, I'll have to discuss with her what ""being kind and compassionate"" means and perhaps its besides the point but I believe its impt to distinguish that being kind and compassionate is not serving as a doormat just to avoid conflict. 

At the same time, like most ppl mentioned, we're both really sensitive right now and may have to part ways for the time being and reconnect when either one of us are in a better place. I'm leaning toward this as I understand she and I have a lot of healing to do on our own."
AmItheAsshole,fplikik,t1_fplhlg1,1588713349.0,"It was such a trivial exchange. It was as if we were having different conversations...her responses  suggested she saw a parallel between ngos and herself...as in...I shouldn't challenge her, because she is person too and it would hurt her feelings. I was thinking this throughout our interaction but figured if I called her out on it, I'd be the bad guy"
AmItheAsshole,fplgniw,t1_fplfg6b,1588712365.0,Haha yea cause the conversation is so dumb
AmItheAsshole,fplgjmt,t1_fplesqq,1588712309.0,"Nah I havent reached out to cause I'm uncertain how to engage with her. She hasn't reached out to me either. 

I've discussed with her before in regards to our conflicting healing processes and how sensitive we are atm and told her it's ok if we need space from each other to recollect ourselves. We didnt discuss that any further tho. 

If we speak, we have to discuss the elephant in the room, but atm she shuts down during any confrontation. 🤷🏾‍♀️"

I read a bit of the manhwa prior to watching the drama and I couldnt read past the 4th chapter. Rude, entitled, and emotionally abusive to people he doesnt find useful to him. 

WWWSK def fails the 'Steve Buscemi' test mentioned above- had PSJ not been the aesthetically pleasing human being he is, I'm gonna go on a whim and say most of us would have not given his character in the drama a chance. 

Now I'm just projecting my personal issues onto this drama 😅, but I was in a toxic relationship with a narcissist where the second I wanted out- the love bombing began. In WWWSK, SK planned on leaving  which is when PSJ freaks out and immediately starts love bombing despite having been largely emotionally unavailable for the majority of their relationship. Yeah I get it, they try and make up for this by later depicting PSJ as a fragile person who has been watching her all this time but like u mentioned...is baptism by fire in the workplace necessary? Seems to romanticize narcissist abuse to me. 

I had mad respect for SK for maintaining professional/personal boundaries in the beginning (before she found out their shared history 🙄). That was refreshing as hell! Everything else was just fan service to PSJ fans"
AsianParentStories,fpdweg3,t1_fpdvpzs,1588535580.0,"I make sure I have as little facetime with her as possible by not sharing the same physical space as her. Rude, but i gotta survive. Fortunately my mom farms for a living and its finally spring so she's been occupied."

I returned to the u.s this past jan after a 3 yr job stint abroad and camped at home to look for a job before moving (which never happened cause my job offer fell through due to pandemic).

While I appreciate and am grateful for having a safety net during the pandemic...I also am so sick of living with my mom. I'm extra careful about accepting any help or money from her cause I know she's gonna throw that back in my face in the future via guilt trip...
And I'm pretty sure I'm going thru a depressive episode lmao but ya know asian moms dgaf if mental health experts and the general public is saying it's okay to be a bum cause theres a fucking pandemic going on 😂😂🙄 

My mom mad my sleep schedule is off and I'm like...is there somewhere I should be?????!!! The world is falling apart here!!"

mentalhealth,fpcawve,t3_gcdan4,1588493708.0,"Yup. In a similar situation rn. Came back from living overseas for 3 years and was in the process or reconnecting with old friends until the pandemic happened. 

I think the pandemic is affecting more that I imagined, and despite being able to use internet to maintain connections with people- I've isolated myself even further...to the point of ignoring phone calls and messages. Guess this is an episode I'm going through. 

I've experienced depression while living overseas where I ddint speak the language and was surprised to find myself rejuvenated after engaging with neighbors...and humans in general. I suspect that might do the trick for me here as well, but I can't get myself to do that either...🤷🏾‍♀️"
Hmong,fpbrqcb,t3_gbaz23,1588477066.0,"I used to believe the bride price inherently objectified women (as in...it was a sinister plot by hmong men to claim women as property). Now I understand my flawed view bears unmistakable signs of projecting meskas (read:white/western) ass feminist views on a complex indigenous cultural practice.

Hmong ppl put some thought into the bride price and back in their villages it more or less served its purpose. It appears the problem today is the bride price is becoming less and less relevant to westernized hmong couples, but because its rooted in culture- elders hold onto it tightly. 

Not sure about you, but I'm in the 1.5 generation- born and raised in usa with refugee parents. I dont believe my traditional mother knows any other way to have a wedding but with bride price negotiations. Think about how short the hmong wedding if there arent any negotiations?! And drinking while negotiating! And the beer industries! Shitty beer industries in close proximity of cities concentrated with hmong ppl will collapse, but I digress. 

Our generation will determine whether this practice is enforced upon and passed down to our children. I suspect it won't be because again, nowadays the bride price is more symbolic than practical. I could be really fucking wrong tho. 

In short, while I find the bride price is problematic in that it may inadvertently trap individuals in abusive relationships or make it challenging for individuals to divorce- I no longer see the bride price as objectifying me...and therefore am not against it for myself. I cant say for sure whether i'll choose to pass it on to my children. I suspect I'll do what some parents have done and pay a bride price but eventually give the money to the couple as a khoom phij cuam/dowry."
