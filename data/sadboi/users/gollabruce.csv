One thing to remember is that it‚Äôs a plant and it is always going to be there. It has unusually strong powers of addiction over some people so if you are trying to quit, give yourself some due credit because you are self aware. Not everyone is self aware. If you go longer periods you will notice you sleep better and feel more rested. Dont be too hard o youself. Things will go your way the more you stay off it.

See  if there is any kind of brain injury association in your area. I have received help and support from the one here in Denver Colorado. It helps to have job coaching and any kind of support from other people who have been through similar things. Let me know if there is anything I can do I would really like to help.

CyclingTech,fho3nxi,t1_fho2zdq,1581740406.0,Not true. If you do 10 to 14 hours a week in your zone 2 for multiple weeks this is not junk. You really have to take it up slow and then add in intervals. Think of it like a pyramid. Once your body is used to the every week consistent load it learns how to recover without doing damage. Then you add in more specific harder loads and the body can handle and recover better than a body with no base training
CyclingTech,fho2sgp,t3_f3vy37,1581739610.0,The bigger base you have the more explosive power you will have when you need it. My coach used to tell me never dual with anyone on a commute or in training rides in winter. Wait wait wait. Build build build that base. Then start interval training. Then when it really matters you will unleash the rath of god almighty and leave eveyone in your wake. I can tell you this really works
CyclingTech,fho2cop,t1_fho2114,1581739210.0,"Base miles~the training miles of cycling you clock up in the off-season or over winter to increase your base fitness level. These are usually gained through long distance, long duration rides taken at a steady, low-to-medium intensity."
CyclingTech,fho1osz,t1_fhnutkq,1581738629.0,What matters is that you ride a bunch at base to build power slowly. I don‚Äôt think a meter is the be all end all of training. I was most succesful at winning races before power meters were even invented. I‚Äôm old (53). Heart rate is still my go to numbers to see how I‚Äôm feeling. Maybe because I know the numbers so well. Some of the new meters are a bit finicky and I wonder if sometimes we are just overthinking the equipment. But marginal gains I guess
