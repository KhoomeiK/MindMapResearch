wsu,fqg91ws,t3_gikgwk,1589340612.0,"Shit. I saw in some covid announcement email they said they still are using funding for building costs for some reason... I can't remember. Forgive my laziness. But yeah, bullshit nonetheless. Just saying they had an excuse. Is this just for Pullman? Where did you find this comprehensive list? Thanks in advance"
uber,fqbwpse,t1_fpeaum5,1589245423.0,"I think it's just to increase the amount of people that tip at all. I can think of a few times I have totally spaced tipping because I just started eating my food and totally forgot. Without the physical interaction with someone like a server in a restaurant, it's easy to just overlook a pop-up notification telling you to consider a tip. 

So, how they combat this (in their mind, I'm sure) is that you can adjust your tip amount after the food has been delivered... so I GUESS if you tipped high to begin with, and the driver delivers your food and is a dick, then you could delete it or lessen. That's all I know lol. Hope that helps."
wsu,fqbu8h0,t3_ge1m8z,1589244019.0,"Hey, not sure if anyone will have answers for my situation but I am having so much trouble with financial aid and CARES act funds that I don't know if I'll be able to finish school... at least for right now. 

Basically I got an email from student financial services that said there is some kind of 'hold' on my account (apparently not an actual hold because it doesn't show on myWSU) that is preventing them from determining if I am eligible to receive my summer aid. For summer, I received the WA College Grant and the Federal Pell Grant, (pretty low income) 

 oh, and the parent plus loan which we won't talk about because I have denied the parent plus loan the past 3 years, so to be offered it every year is really obnoxious because my parents aren't helping pay for my college at all and are not interested in taking out a loan for me. 

I called a while ago and talked to someone from financial services about if they can tell whether or not I'll get summer aid grants because I dropped classes which violated my Stupid Academic Plan (SAP) and so they hold state aid when that happens. She said there should be some forgiveness going on due to COVID-19, however, that I will probably have to pay a late fee for paying tuition late because they have to wait for grades to be posted and the day grades are posted is *after 2 of my summer classes start.* Today is the first day of summer class and I have not even bothered to log in to blackboard because I don't even know if I will receive the money to pay for it. It's shitty because like, I don't want to put in the work if I end up not getting any money and having to drop the class because the work won't have earned me anything, but if I don't do the work and then find out I can take the class then I'll have tainted my grade UGH.

OK- the CARES act. I should be eligible based on the list of requirements they've sent out. In fact, I'm probably part of the most eligible. I haven't received anything saying I'm being sent money or to check off my to do list. I'm not sure if I am just getting it really late because my last name starts with a T and I saw some of you said you noticed people at the beginning of the alphabet getting theirs.

Last, I haven't gotten a stimulus check or my tax return refund. So, just putting it out there if anyone knows a lot about that. 

Fucking frustrated to say the least."
box5,fqb3amp,t1_fprdk9n,1589229834.0,Yes! That's what I was thinking about the phantom and his son too.
box5,fqb328n,t3_gdd8b4,1589229717.0,"I remember the first time I heard that LND was set in Coney Island I was really weirded out. HOWEVER, after seeing the musical live and also seeing the filmed Broadway version, I kind of like it tbh. Think about the mentioning in POTO of Erik being the devil's spawn as a child, he was surrounded by ""freaks"" of nature. He clearly considers himself also a freak of nature so it seems like it makes sense he just surrounded himself with people and characters he relates to. I think about this more during ""The Beauty Underneath"" where he is pointing out to Gustave all the weird and creepy things in Phantasma but he finds them beautiful. Also note that he'd been getting paid a shitton from the managers at the opera house, don't you think he probably bribed or just bought his way to own the circus? It seems odd he would own it but I imagine he just conned whoever he had to convince. 

Also, I want to point something out that I haven't noticed in the comments. A lot of you in this thread are not convinced that Erik and Christine could still be in love, mainly Christine. But don't forget, the Phantom was NOT just some creepy dude that kidnapped her... her father died, who inspired her as a child to find the beauty in music and she was told she would be visited by the angel of music. She believes the Phantom is the angel of music and she has been visited and he trains her to sing to his liking, but she feels like she's in a trance when singing for him. (Whether or not he in fact IS this ""angel of music"" I don't know if that's canonically correct or if it's up for debate, I know that's what they say but I have never understood what he really is honestly) but the point is there's mystery and mystical feeling. 

So, even after 10 years of raising a son with your new husband, wouldn't you still remember how you were TRAINED BY AN ANGEL and have leftover trauma and sticky feelings??? Especially if you knew your son is not genetically your husband's son, and your son is a constant reminder of her past. 

I agree that I think the story needs to take advantage of the family aspect. It's touched on but I don't really like how. Erik is realizing how similar Gustave is to him and they have the whole song where they're looking at creepy shit. But like I think it would have been cool if Erik truly changed because of the father-son bond he felt when he met him. He feels for the first time a fatherly love instead of a romantic love only for Christine and he thrives on it...  ok... I had more thoughts but my brain is mush now"
depression,fpjnobr,t1_fox841q,1588675224.0,Reading this shook me to my core. I hope you start to find joy and clarity in your life soon
uber,fpea1u4,t3_gcy7xm,1588543365.0,The driver doesn't actually get the tip until about an hour after delivery in case something goes wrong. I'm pretty sure they expect you to call uber support and tell them you never received your food and you will receive a full refund including the tip. (Source: I drive for uber eats)

It's not typically my thing to be ordered around. Nonetheless your voice is really cool"

I just wanted to post a selfie and mock girls that fish for compliments. But it doesn't matter lol that was just rude af. Congratulations you're one of the many Reddit Assholes. I feel like it's kinda weird to tell a young woman to grow up unless you're literally my fucking dad"
uber,fliohkj,t1_fler6jh,1585187012.0,"I know it's obvious but I was also wondering what the reason might have been like if he actually did have no ill intentions you know? Or if someone has experience with a driver doing that... I just wanted to put it out there. Also, later I wondered if maybe he meant I could have his number to be able to text or call before I request a ride on the app to find out if he is nearby, and then if he is then go to the app and request a ride. That would actually make sense and I misunderstood, idk, it was hard to read his body language because of the language/cultural barrier, so that was another reason I had no idea his intention. Like people with similar traits and cultural norms as me, I'd be able to read their vibe a lot easier."

It must have been what I think you said in another comment, like your physical self was playing along with the surrounding reality and people...but to think about that happening without consciously knowing you're doing it is hard to fathom. Anyway, I'm glad you're ok and that nothing too bad came out of the situation. 

Also, no one ever told me vape stuff doesn't show up in testing. What about edibles? Is it only if you smoke? (Sorry in advance for my naivitÃ©)"

And yeah, I probably would say the same thing if it never happened to me ""I'd do it immediately"" but it's actually terrifying, well it was for me, I've never been involved in a case with police before. I didn't know what to expect at all. I don't think we have any texts like that, a lot of our texts are gone anyway (snapchat). I've reported it and they're investigating it actually seems to be going well from what I can tell."

This is one of the scariest things I've ever done, but I just got off the phone with the officer who interviewed me for my case and she was very calm and just trying to understand what happened. I'm meeting with her in person on Friday. I can't believe I just did that but thank you. Like you said, even if he is not convicted, at least I reported it."

I'll be honest part of me was mad that he broke up with me and the chain of events ended up with this happening. But I didn't think it was his fault. And I hope you understand this was very fresh after the break up. Looking at it now I completely understand ending our relationship and the timing and events that followed were just very unfortunate. Please don't feel guilty for what happened to your ex. As someone who can relate to her experience, that is the last thing I would want my ex to feel. Although, we didn't end it with bad taste, so it might be different. But I still highly doubt she thinks it's your fault whatsoever. The only person to blame is the rapist. That should ALWAYS be the only person at fault. Not the victim, or you. I feel like it's too late to go to the police, I don't know. Maybe you guys can help me figure this out on this thread because a lot of you guys are saying to do that. I just don't want to relive it anymore than I have to, and I'm worried that I won't be able to prove it if he denies everything. Also I just don't really have time to be dealing with a case with police. I'm in college pursuing a career and almost graduating. Idk."
tinderstories,fdi1md4,t1_fdgevjw,1578434132.0,"Thank you, I have tried a couple therapists and have been taking care of myself for the most part. I know it's rape, idk sometimes I just feel weird actually saying ""I was raped"" because some people don't want to believe me. My friends felt really bad, they were just drunk and went to some pub instead of meeting up with him and I. I don't blame them for what happened. But as you can probably imagine I did still feel a bit of resentment towards them because if they had shown up and not flaked this probably wouldn't have happened to me. My friends have supported me through it and helped me navigate my emotions. I considered filing a police report, but I was scared shitless. There's more to the story, he made himself out to be the victim in this when we talked the next day. He kept saying to not make him out to be a rapist because ""I'm the guy so it looks bad"" and begged me to not ""twist the situation"". I didn't know what he would do if I went to the police, so I just decided to focus on myself. I'm in college and there are resources for this type of thing there and they helped me get extensions on projects, etc."
