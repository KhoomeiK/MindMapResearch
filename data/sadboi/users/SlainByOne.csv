No, he is only concerned about Lily. He only mentions them because he is trying to get Dumbledore to save Lily. When he finally asks for all of them to be saved it's like he realised it's what he should have done from the start. You should read the quote again about him finally asking for the entire familys protection.

> Ok. You think D is really disgusted. If he is, he's a huge fucking hypocrite, because he is putting a price on protecting his own people, so his disgust is meaningless and his opinion doesn't count.

Yeah he probably is a ""huge fucking hypocrite"" because what Snape did was disgusting and it was a pretty fitting reaction to it.

> He does love her, hence asking V to spare her and then going to D to save her and her family. Whom, again, he has no moral duty toward.

He came only really to ask for her life to be saved and only after being met with a strong reaction asks for the whole family to be saved. If he was a good person it would have been natural for him to be more concerned for Harry originally. But he really didn't care much for Harry or James so he was not concerned about their lives. I do get not giving a crap about James considering their history, but Harry was an innocent.


>  Yours is hinged on the belief that Snape could have asked Vold to not act on the prophecy

No, there are many things he could have done before begging Voldemort to not kill Lily. His desperate move here tells a lot about him, instead of finding alternatives he goes straight for something really grim. If he had real goodness in him he would have gone for a much better alternative to start with, not the death of a child."

To endanger yourself to help anyone who isn't your own child/brother/whatever is insanely altruistic. Snape was in no position to get V to not kill Harry after he unfortunately gave him the prophecy so saving Lily has nothing to do with it


So Snape is supposed to love Lily? The love of his life and also his best friend. 
And her baby is apparently just a random child to him? Even if he ended up with Lily at this point he would have been this random childs stepfather. Your argument makes it seem he really have no idea what love really is.

Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore.
