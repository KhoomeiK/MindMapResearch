politics,fo9gyh8,t1_fo8u8m6,1587619240.0,Completely agree on the right v left. That’s bs. I hope your wife can get back to doing what she loves soon. Stay safe and healthy!
politics,fo8lvdl,t1_fo12vd0,1587599111.0,"That wasn’t my intention and your right, in the grand scheme of things not being able to do that is not even close to what your dealing With. I hope that we get through this quick. Good luck to you."
politics,fo8kt8x,t1_fo12kjt,1587598506.0,"Never thought of it as a hitler ban nor did i say that. Not even in the slightest. I was just pointing out that there is some frustration with the extent. Again, I don’t understand why I can walk into a Walmart and buy bread but one isle over I can’t walk down for seeds. I adhere to social distancing and to be honest I rarely leave my house because i don’t want myself or my family to get sick or spread this. You have to admit, it’s kind of messed up that I can go play golf at my private club right now but playing at any public(privately owned as well as municipal) is banned."
politics,fo0hhcw,t1_fnzkigw,1587413223.0,"Michigan guy here. We are pissed at her. We can go to Home Depot and buy wood but we can’t buy seeds, (they literally have the home and garden center cautioned off) we can go on the lake in a row boat but can’t if the boat has a motor.  If we have a cottage somewhere else is the state we are banned from using it. Most people are out of work because they are considered non essential but liquor marijuana and the lottery are all considered essential. We understand the importance of quarantine and social distancing but she has just gone to far with this. 

Nothing to do with politics on this either."
Coronavirus,fnlr1r9,t1_fnlltj4,1587058246.0,Let’s hope. Ever since Covid started becoming a thing in the US my asthma has been in hyper drive. I’m hoping to chalk that up to Anxiety and Allergies now.
Anxiety,fnjqnl3,t1_fnjnrbo,1587004749.0,Ty!!!!
Anxiety,fnjcbe4,t1_fnjbynq,1586996101.0,I hope the same for you too!
Anxiety,fnjc6rf,t3_g1xy0t,1586996029.0,Honestly I had a real hard time with taking multiple meds too. I was always nervous about interaction. I talked to my therapist about it and she told me call my Pharmacist and ask them all my questions. After that I was ok.
Anxiety,fnjbmur,t1_fnjaypx,1586995721.0,Thank you I really appreciate you sharing that. I just found this thread today and I happy I did. It’s nice to knowing other people have gotten through it.
Anxiety,fnja0ql,t1_flf4s1z,1586994824.0,That makes 4. I have all the same issues been going on for 3wks plus. Xanax works so I have to keep telling myself it’s in my head. But just like you it’s really hard to be around people. Hardest is with two kids 3 and 1 1/2. When they loose there minds it immediately sends me through the roof. I feel horrible and I try to remove myself from the situation.  Anxiety fucking sucks. And this bullshit virus has brought to the extreme.
politics,flc33am,t3_fnu41d,1585018674.0,I don’t particularly agree with AOC that often but this seems like a no brainer.
politics,flbk5ge,t3_fnpcjr,1585006312.0,What a fucking Dick
