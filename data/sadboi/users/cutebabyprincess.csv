No, it’s really not. I understand saying ASIDE from rape but implying abortion and rape can be easily separated or don’t have any correlation is inaccurate.

Sometimes condoms break
Sometimes people miss a pill
Sometimes people (rightfully) don’t want to get IUDs

There are countless reasons really but sometimes things just happen, and it’s better to have them as an option to make a woman carry a baby for 9 months to teach her a lesson for a mistake.

Honestly, as a girl, from the way things are sounding, she might have told a friend you were coming over and asked for them to make a couple disruptions as she wasn’t completely comfortable. 
That might not be the case but judging by her lack of reciprocation and the awkward sitting/ the makeout lasting 15/20 seconds, the whole thing sounds like she was really uncomfortable.
