relationships,fajmn2v,t1_fajmdey,1576145666.0,"I really enjoyed our connection. And honestly I've been trying to make new friends but like. I don't mean so sound like a pile of shit but. I really have a hard time finding valuable people that I can connect with.feels like Everyone I meet are fake, lost, depressed or really struggling. I'm not hating on people that are going through tough times, I've been there myself but I'm looking for a friendship or relationship where both parties work together and help each other instead of what it feels like. Me putting in so much effort or just being other peoples bucket for others to throw their problems at. Ik it's rare to find but Damnnnn am I struggling to find that."
relationships,fajkgje,t1_fajkdob,1576142346.0,Point would be to have someone to talk to since I've just lost many friend and would want someone to talk to. I'm truly over her. I figure theres a chance she might not wanna be friends and at that point I wouldn't bother.

offmychest,epjldly,t3_buykne,1559255531.0,"Ok, Imma give you my opinion and then a small piece of advice and I hope it helps you re-evauate your emotions  


Personally I could not agree more with you with ""  everyone tells me I “have my whole life ahead of me” but I want a life with someone else. I want a forever person. I want to be in love and to be loved back. "" Because everyone I know has a SO and their all so happy and seems like because everyones busy with theri SO Im getting less attention as a friend and i dont wanna be a selffish dude who wants all their friends attention, so ya. It would be really fucking nice to have a SO myself for someone to enjoy my love and to receive the equal amount back.   


However this part where you say its impossible to find guys...etc part. That unfortunately is just a bad case of bad odds. Its unfortunate that the people in the past have said really negative things about you but It never ok to tell yourself its ""impossible"" for anything. Take me for example, I find all black women so attractive, even those who my friends dont agree are attractive. I love all black women, and yea it seems as if people are subjective towards their race of preference but thats a different ugly hole to jump into for another date. Point is, there are people who like black women and yes, they exist.   


Also I believe that many girls struggle to keep their eyes open for good guys, not sure if this applies to you but lemme explain. I am the type of guy girls always call nice, and sweet. But ive never had a girl actually take me serious when i really mean nice things to them because I really like them. Countless girls say ""I didnt know you liked me that way"" when i admit my feelings because all the girls ive always liked have been blindly chasing after jerks, and assholes. And many of them overlook the actual decent guys, Why? i have no fucking clue. But....just be aware of this and if it applies to you then. Take a moment to go over the list of guys you have liked and guys that have liked you.   


Finally. I strongly believe that its okay to really want a relationship but. I cant stress this enough, Nothing is more important in a relationship than simply loving yourself. Relationships that fill in the holes of your insecurities are the ones that end with the most pain. When you break your leg, you dont just apply a bandaid then keep walking the next day. This is the same with relationships, because after they rip off the bandaid off, not only it sting because its sinked into your insecurites and other things. YOU STILL HAVE A BROKEN BONE.   
My point is, dont be asking for a relationship if you have personal issues that need to be addressed first. And if you do love yourself truly. Then its just a matter of time and getting yourself out there. Cheers"
offmychest,epjizm7,t3_buyu3x,1559254582.0,"I'm about to give you advice you probably wont want to listen to but, ultimately will be the hardest  pill to swallow for you to move on.  


You must not say, ""I can't"" and start saying ""i am having troubles""  
You must not say ""Why can't I get over you"" and instead say ""How can I get over her""  


Only until you come to the facts that you need to move on, you will need to change your train of thought to help you collaborate with your brain to start working on yourself. And only then will you start working towards moving on and getting over her."
offmychest,epji0b8,t1_epjhdt6,1559254194.0,"yea your totally right.  


Check out this ted talk, and listen closely to the failure part. This changed my life

offmychest,epjhnyn,t1_epjgsb8,1559254066.0,"IDK if you believe in the subconcious, since theres very little scientific evidence to it. Anyways Personally I believe that theres a mind, behind out conscious mind that is always on, listening and paying attention. Im no expert but im sure there has been a build up of things that have caused you to all of a sudden miss her. Could be litereally anything, for ex. visiting any place you guys liking going to, or listening to a song you both liked.  small things like this subconsciously make you think of her because there was a correlation between a ""thing"" and your ex. Believe me i had to cut out so many things out of my life to just get over this girl I loved. And shit still makes me think about her.   


I think what you should be doing is not focus on why you miss her and just avoid the whole topic of your ex completely. But hey good for you for gyming and working, at least your doing something for your self. and something is better than nothing. Cheers"
offmychest,epjglcc,t3_buz2qv,1559253638.0,"Thats rough, sorry that it didnt work out.  


I similarly wanted to become a twitch streamer, Back when i was in high school I put a lot of effort into it and I probably would have been able to start a career in it, had my parents not forced me to focus on school, which i still failed at and barely graduated.  


Ive always considered youtube to be such a fragile platform, since its changing to often and Its hard to stay on top of the game. I still believe that to be successful in youtube you need 40% of good content, lengthy content, quality and unique content and hard work, and then 60% is luck/a shit ton of friends, that help you build a audience. Sometimes people just find your content which you can get lucky with. Or you can have the advantage of having many friends.   


Anyways. Make sure to always take care of yourself. and dont be too hard on yourself. Cheers"
