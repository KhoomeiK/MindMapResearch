ladycyclists,fow5qth,t1_fovxets,1588113514.0,"It isn’t really about the firmness vs. softness as it is about shape and support. Those bulkier gel saddles can get in the way of your pedalstroke and may not actually support you in the right places. In fact, it can put pressure on places where you don’t want it. Personally, I need a saddle that supports my wide sit bones, but has an appropriately placed cutout or depression as not to put pressure on soft tissues. For me, that means having a Selle SMP Avant on all my road bikes and a Specialized Mimic on all my mountain bikes. I would love to ride the Avant on everything, but the nose shape is not MTB friendly for me as it gets in the way. The side bonus to these less padded saddles is that they are lighter, but that is not why I use them. 

If you go to a good local bike shop, they will usually have a tool you can sit on that will measure your sit bones (which have nothing to do with how big your rump is). That will help them guide you towards a saddle that will fit you well. Some saddles are expensive, but if you tell them what you are hoping to spend, a good shop will find something that will work within your budget. Some shops even have test saddles so you can try them before you buy. One caution with that is that you may need several rides to get used to a new saddle. It will feel hard and strange and you might be a little sore (it should not chaff though). 

Really though, don’t be embarrassed to go to a shop and seek guidance. Just ask if there is someone that can help you find the right saddle. They should  ask you how far you like to ride, about your position on the bike, if you get any pain from your current saddle, goals, etc. My husband is a bike fitter and he has heard it all- including from me. He has heard about every part of the female and male anatomy that can get chaffed, pinched, numb, and bruised.  It is his job to make riding comfortable for folks. 

Just a note on bike shorts- if you do decide to get something with a chamois (I highly recommend it- I never ride without one), never wear underwear underneath (except to try them on at the store), make sure they fit snugly, and as with saddles sometimes thicker is not better. Really great chamois often have different densities of padding in different parts, but you don’t need the Rolls Royce of bike shorts for 10-20 miles rides."

Interstitialcystitis,foqab7v,t1_fopco5a,1587988291.0,"It’s been a few years, so I can’t remember exactly, but it started with a 20 minutes or so. We would generally do 10-15 minute jumps twice a week if I could do it, with the expectation that the time given was a minimum. So if I didn’t have to pee, I wouldn’t go just because it was time to. I do remember plateauing at one point, so we increased more slowly for a while. Sometimes I felt like I really did have to pee sooner than scheduled, so when that happened my PT told me to wait 2 minutes and if it still felt like I really had to go, then I would. Most of the time though, after two minutes the extreme feeling would have subsided. We stopped actively extending the time when I was happy with my progress which was less of a time thing and more of when I could tell when my bladder was legit full and when I could wait long enough for it get to that point. One strategy I use to double check is pressing on my bladder, if the urge increases significantly, then my bladder is actually full. All that said, I do not have capacity problems, just frequency when flaring. Now that I can identify a full bladder, I just go when I need to, but just by habit I find myself waiting a few minutes after I get the urge just to check if it’s legit lol. This was a game changer for being able to sleep through the night for the most part. I do still wake up when my bladder is feeling sensitive, but I can quickly figure out if I need to get out of bed or not.

I make my own electrolyte replacement drink for long training rides. I use maple syrup to replace some calories and then the electrolyte liquid linked above mixed with water. Sometimes I add blueberry juice to cut the sweetness of the syrup and add more flavor. I water it down a lot, but it doesn’t hurt me. The caplets are also OK if I drink enough water with them if I don’t need the calories at the movement.

Edit to add- the caplets might be a better option if you can’t handle any citric acid at all. The liquid has a small amount. I usually go half strength and am alternating drinking that mix with plain water. I only use this when I’m on a hard ride and it’s wicked hot or it is a very long ride and I just can’t eat enough to stay ahead of bonking, so I’m not sure how this works as a stand-alone drink."
Interstitialcystitis,foo10ut,t3_g8iswz,1587930386.0,"So that was not how bladder retraining worked for me. My PT helped me come up with a voiding schedule. I would wait a certain amount of time after urinating before going again, even though I felt like I needed to go sooner. Gradually we increased the time I would hold it. I was not instructed to drink large amounts of water beyond my normal (which was admittedly a lot). This was paired with regular physical therapy. I started to see results in a few weeks, not months. Years later, I still do the exercises my PT taught me when I am flaring, but’s that’s rare now. I don’t think the point was to just stretch my bladder. My PT explained that it was really just teaching my body and mind to work together again to identify when my bladder is actually full rather than sending signals that I need to pee when my bladder is nearly empty because of discomfort. For me, it was 100% worth it, but YMMV. Like many things with this condition (like sticking with the diet or being good about taking meds or listening to your body), bladder retraining takes perseverance and hard work, so don’t give up too soon if you decide to try it.

Interstitialcystitis,fo91pnb,t3_g6bt7o,1587608560.0,"I’m copying my comment from an old post:

I’m in my early 30’s and have officially had IC for 3ish years (4+ now). I’m pretty lucky that I can manage my IC by following the IC diet (I was SUPER strict in the beginning, now I can eat many more things), drinking lots of water, bladder retraining, PT, and other self care practices to manage occasional flares (heating pads, taking Prelief when I eat/drink something acidic, knowing how to determine what is causing the flare and treat it appropriately, etc). I live a pain/urgency/frequency free life 95% of the time. Most days I forget I have IC. For every story that you hear of someone that is struggling to find relief, there are probably 5 ICers like me- you just don’t hear from us much because IC is just a minor inconvenience most of the time. I’m not saying that I don’t get a horrible hormonal flare now and again. I’m also an idiot and try foods that I know may cause a flare because “this time might be different” (I clearly have an abusive relationship with chili- I know it hurts me, but I just keep going back). Finding the right treatment for you might take a long time, with lots of trial and error. My doctor is a rockstar and she and I found a drug-free (not that drugs are bad) option that worked, but it took months for me to feel a significant improvement. That first flare was a doozy. I was so sad. I felt robbed of a happy, active future. After a few weeks of pain and so many tears, I buckled down and committed to my treatment plan. Within 6 months, I had my life mostly back. Now I do all my favorite active hobbies (cycling, skiing, CrossFit, etc.), I can go out and have drinks with friends every now and again (within reason- no more Cape Codders or wine for me, but some beers and other mixed drinks are fine in moderation), I travel, and I basically just live normally. So yeah, it gets better. All ICers are different and your mileage may vary, but there is hope. I wish I had seen more folks saying that in the beginning when everything seemed so bleak. Things are going to get better."

They were both army officers, so they spent the first years of their marriage stationed in amazing places together and deployed in war zones together and apart. They went through some very trying experiences together and it only made their marriage stronger. Unfortunately, my brother in law was tragically killed just shy of their tenth anniversary, leaving my sister and her 18 month old daughter with a gaping hole in their world. Losing my brother in law really made me realize that he and my sister had a perfect marriage- it’s not like they never had disagreements, but they were there for one another when it mattered. My grandparents were married when my grandmother was 17 and my grandfather was 20. They had a happy 60+ years together. I guess when you find the right person, being young doesn’t matter.

Friday and I’m just going to see my staff and our regular patrons? Jeans and a fun top."

I would rather be there in the relative safety of the North East Kingdom, but there is no internet on our mountain so I can’t work. Also, there is very limited medical care up there and we wouldn’t want to add to the strain on the system if we were to fall ill. BUT that is pretty different than the Cape, where high capacity medical centers are not far away (the islands are a different story). Either way, I totally agree- take precautions and quarantine for two weeks. The important thing is deciding where to hunker down and then staying put."

I got what felt like every side effect on the label- headaches, stomach issues, increased anxiety, feeling really tired, feeling fidgety, constant thirst, excessive yawning, etc. My general mood and baseline anxiety started improving after about 3 weeks, but I was still feeling MORE panicked than before. At this point, the only significant side effect I have are really vivid dreams. The rest have largely faded and I do feel better. My baseline anxiety has definitely improved and the occasional panic is uncommon and manageable. I’m still not feeling anxiety free and am not sure if this is the medication for me, but I would recommend sticking it out the side effects. Most will go away from what my pharmacist said when I called her after feeling so off. She was right."

There are tons of flavors. The vanilla nut is my favorite. Caffix is an instant alternative that’s pretty good, although I think Teeccino beats them all. White hot chocolate is another favorite. I get the Land o’ Lakes kind (yes, the same brand as the butter). I can do regular hot chocolate if I make it weak, but it is a trigger for a lot of people and the white hot chocolate is so good that it’s not worth the risk to have meh hot cocoa.

RedditForGrownups,fnf5mhu,t1_fnf1240,1586901837.0,"I think it might be regional? Our town doesn’t even provide a bus to students that live close by, so many kids walk and ride bikes. We also live in a small neighborhood on a lake, so the kids are always out playing on the trails, swimming in the summer, and playing hockey in the winter. It’s nice to see that the kids in our neighborhood are enjoying the same stuff I enjoyed as a kid even though this is suburban Massachusetts and I grew up in more rural New Hampshire. I also am a librarian in a town nearer to Boston. Kids 4th grade and up are allowed to visit the library alone after school- they walk and ride their bikes over. Downtown is only a 1/2 mile away, so they often go to the small grocery store and grab a snack before coming to the library. Their parents just come by and get them before supper. This was the same case in my previous library. My current library is in a very, very wealthy town and the last one was in a very blue collar town, so I don’t think it is a socioeconomic thing. Bummer that kids in your area are missing out on being a little independent."
RedditForGrownups,fnf03sg,t3_g1c2qq,1586898983.0,"I’m 33, so this wasn’t that long ago. My sister and I would take the bus home sometimes, but we would usually walk the mile two miles because it was more fun. We’d play in the woods down by the river or at the pond on the way home or stop by a friend’s house. We’d just call my mom at work and let her know if we were home or not. Sometimes we would go to the burger place and get fries and a Cherry Coke by pooling our leftover recess money- they would sell popcorn or ice cream bars during morning recess for 35¢ and my mom would give us each two quarters a day to buy a snack, so by the end of the week we had plenty of change to share fries and a coke. This was very typical in our part of New Hampshire in the 90’s. I can remember that I used to put my key in my lunch sack, but on several occasions it got mixed with the lunch leavings and tossed in the bin. Those were the days that we learned to break into our house with a screwdriver from the shed. I had to do that once as an adult at our cabin in VT when the lock was frozen. My husband was very impressed. I would have never had that skill if my mom had been home after school lol."

It helps that she always gives them treats and often has their favorite preschooler in tow. I’m the one that brushes them and takes then to the vet, so I’m less cool. 

It is funny though, my niece lived with my husband, dogs, and I for a year while my sister was deployed (she’s an army officer and widow) and while she was away, my niece has no problem recognizing me as auntie, although she called my husband “new mommy” lol.

I always wear eyeliner and mascara during the workweek, but nothing else regularly, so it isn’t even as if my skin is reacting to not wearing heavy makeup (although I’ve only worn mascara a few times when I need to video conference).

Interstitialcystitis,fn2ltyi,t3_fytyyy,1586593836.0,"Once you figure out what flares you, you may be able to add stuff back in- I can have yogurt in safe flavors (I stick to maple, vanilla, or blueberry usually) and make smoothies with blueberries, apples, banana, carrots, and a little spinach. Bell peppers are my main source of vitamin C, but I eat apples too. Homemade apple sauce is another great source and it’s super easy in a slow cooker. 

As for your lunch, tuna is fine, just replace the dressing. I like herb and garlic infused olive oil. You can even make your own with herbs you like, I go heavy on the garlic and oregano. 

I went through an alkaline water phase, but it was no better for my IC than tap water. I guess I just have good tap water? 

Following the diet is hard at first, but some ICers can manage their condition primarily though diet changes (luckily I’m one of them), so it is really worth giving it a good try for a few months."

Interstitialcystitis,fmun9w7,t1_fms051m,1586394776.0,"You’ll find something that works! Chlorine doesn’t bother me as long as I shower right after, but I mostly do open water swimming when the weather is nice (I’m very fortunate to live in a tiny house on a lake) . As far as cycling goes, wider is not always better. Taking pressure off of soft tissues, supporting your sit bones, and putting you in a good position is what a good saddle will do. The best thing you can do is find a local bike shop that has a fitter. A professional fitter will listen to you and assess your needs and measure the width and position of your sit bones. They may not be familiar with IC in particular, but it is their job to adapt bikes to individual needs. It isn’t cheap, but it can make all the difference. On my road bike, I needed up completely changing my saddle from what I used pre-IC. Now I use this one- https://www.sellesmp.com/en/saddles/professional/avant.html?___SID=U . The cutout takes all pressure off my urethral area and the shape supports my pelvis. It has made the difference between riding with discomfort and riding pain free. All that said, I no saddle takes away the hustling on a downhill MTb trail. Even the best suspension can’t take that away, so I have learned to live with a certain amount of discomfort when mountain biking, but it’s so much part of who I am that I’m willing to deal with that."

These days, that is the bulk of what I do. Another redditor recommended this fabulous athlete on YouTube:

https://youtu.be/CYD7f5b_qj4

I did that workout today after a couple of slow miles with my dogs and it was perfect. For free. No equipment needed.  Oh and if you have to scale movements or take longer breaks, no big deal. CrossFit taught me to only compare myself to myself yesterday. I definitely apply that to anything I approach athletically now. If I’m getting better or even just getting out there, then it’s a win."

Interstitialcystitis,fmowqin,t3_fwjidn,1586269996.0,"I’m an athlete with IC! Your mileage may vary, but you can find activities that work for you! For example, the exercise I can tolerate best while flaring is swimming laps. I find the stretching and reaching to be really soothing. Also, it is a hell of a cardio workout if you push yourself. You can also use a pull buoy (it’s a float you hold between your thighs) so that you are only using your upper body if kicking vigorously is bothersome. I’m a competitive cyclist and a CrossFit athlete. I was a cyclist long before IC and picked up CrossFit afterward. My IC is largely under control, but I still get the occasional hormonal flare. I did take time off the bike I when I was diagnosed to sort myself out with a physical therapist (highly recommended btw) and sorted out my saddle and position on the bike with a bike fitter (also highly recommended). That’s when I picked up swimming laps again. Even now, high impact stuff can be uncomfortable when flaring, like running or jumping rope. Most of the time I just power through it, but if I’m feeling really shitty, I will sub out running in a workout with a low impact cardio like rowing, biking, or the ski erg. 

What really helped me to learn to power through it was realizing that for me, bladder discomfort from exercise was really short lived after I stopped exercising (I feel no worse than before about a half hour after stopping). The other thing that helped was being open to modifying how I do things. Doing double unders and some heavy lifts put pressure on my bladder, so I know that I need to go pee directly before doing those things. I also wear black leggings on days I know that stuff is in the workout, just in case I pee a little so it isn’t noticeable. I also just tell myself that we are all sweating so much, that no one would even see a few drops of pee. Talking to other female lifters also made me realize that others do the same thing even without having IC. 

One thing I will really recommend if all this seems intimidating is body weight exercises. Things like planks are simple, no impact, and can really stabilize your core. If you feel comfortable there, try pushups. Lunges, squats, calf raises, dips, etc. can all be done at home. Start out slow and build. Try just doing a 30 second plank, three times a day. Do you have stairs in your house or a sturdy stool? Try step ups. Sit ups can put pressure on a tender bladder, but there are other core exercises that are effective but gentler. Look up “penguins” or “super mans”. Really, there is a lot you can try. Just start slow and spread it throughout your day. You don’t have to do everything at once. If it feels better to do 10 push-ups and then go on a brisk walk for 10 minutes three times a day, that is just as valuable as doing a 30 minute walk and 30 push-ups all at once! 

Don’t be afraid to try new things. Know that some stuff just won’t work for you, but the only was to know is to try. Think outside the box. Is slow stretching and movement ok? Well, you just described casual indoor bouldering. That’s super fun. The hardest part is being brave enough to know that trying something might be painful, but if you can get past that, you may find a new passion. You can do it!"

Well, forget gag gift. We both actually love it. We don’t really wipe so much as just pat dry. We use way less TP and both my husband and I agree that we will never go without a bidet again. The bidet is just cold water, cost under $30 on amazon, and took me all of 15 minutes to install with very basic tools. As far as how it is for my IC, I haven’t had a major flare since I’ve had it, just monthly hormonal ones, but I have to say, I find the cool water soothing and you have to shimmy a little bit to get the water in the right spot, but it makes cleanup after sex and during your period amazingly easy. I am 100% team bidet."

I realized pretty quickly that processed and artificial junk is much more dangerous for my bladder. Keeping it simple helps me know exactly what is flaring me.

That said, I can eat Oreos and tootsie rolls with no problem and those are pretty processed, but I only indulge in that kind of stuff if I am feeling really good."
