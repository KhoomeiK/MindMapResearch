CrazyHand,fm1pj1u,t3_fse3fg,1585682683.0,"1. Save your jump until it is absolutely necessary to use it. This will save your life many times. 
2. Know exactly how far your character can go before you‚Äôre not making it back
3. Mix up your options. To practice this, pick a character with a lot of recovery options like zss. You can go low with boost kick, you can go high with flip jump, you can tether, you can use flip jump to snap to the ledge, and many more creative options using air dodge and other tools. Then when you play every time you are coming back to stage try and trick your opponent. Ex: Go high with flip kick twice and then go low. You basically get to recover for free because they think you‚Äôre gonna flip jump but you just go low. Basically keep mixing up your options until they think they have you figured out and then pull another trick out. Good characters for this are zss, inkling, joker, pokemon trainer, pikachu, etc. once you have this down, try the same thing with a character with a bad recovery like chrom, cloud,  Ike, etc. you‚Äôll get a lot better at not getting spiked. 
4. Go into training mode and beat the hell out of a bot. Go super deep even if you die.
Good luck"

feminineboys,flornfh,t3_fq1qi1,1585344080.0,"The best strategy I can think of is to take up running for a week. This means go on at least a mile run every day and then shave your legs. There is a good chance your parents won‚Äôt notice. If they do notice just say that since you‚Äôve been running you shaved your legs because it‚Äôs much easier. Do a little bit of research about why runners shave their legs so you sound like you know what you‚Äôre talking about. The best way to fly under the radar is to not tell them you‚Äôre going to shave your legs. If you approach them beforehand, this will put suspicion on you. If you simply don‚Äôt tell them and wait for them to notice, they‚Äôll most likely buy your excuse so long as you actually go running frequently."
