ScientificNutrition,fpm0hdt,t1_fpjmyio,1588723059.0,Add to this that the harvesting of grains completely changed with modern techniques. It used to be that wheat was cut and left to dry out in the field. Once dried it was left to ferment in the farms and then it was ready to be used. I recently talked to a farmer that told me that back until around ww2 between the harvesting and making flour it could have been 2 months. Not to talk about the very refined flour we now have and that is very different from the flour you can get with donkey powered stone mill.

- a good soundcard like something from Steinberg or Focusrite (with enough ins and outs for everything he wants to plug in it)

- a synth: better go for a polysynth that can play chords than a mono that can play only one note at a time

- a good pair of speakers (we call these monitor speakers) to break the walls like KRK 6 so we can hear sub-bass sounds

- Abelton Live Lite 10 that will come free with some of the equipment

In alternative to some of this he might like a Novation Circuit but that's a very specific piece of kit... So again better ask him.
