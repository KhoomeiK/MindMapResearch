schizophrenia,feklgsb,t3_eov1cp,1579202513.0,"I have been feeling the same things, right down to the not feeling traditional loneliness. I’ve given up on social interaction entirely both because it’s not important to me and because I’ve become so visibly schizophrenic by this point that no one but other people with schizophrenia want to befriend me

Just yesterday I came to the realization that I’ve been insane for much longer than I originally thought and it gave me the feeling of being stuck in a private vacuum reality path that may have never or only briefly overlapped with the perceptual lenses of “normal” people. now it’s so far off course as to be completely incapable of effectively interacting with those lenses at all, but I don’t really care because there’s no underlying desire for that interaction anyways and I care a lot more about discovering the most “true” nature of reality, which I feel this lens with its lack of a structured self is better suited for anyhow"

traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fb7g5bj,t1_fb7eycc,1576588955.0,"That’s great!

The experience of being trans can be vastly different from person to person - some trans people do have physical dysphoria, some only have social dysphoria, and others don’t really have any at all. It doesn’t really matter either way. But there is nothing unreasonable about pointing out that perception of one’s physical sex is a real thing that almost certainly influences or causes dysphoria.

I really promise I’m not trans med - I’m AFAB and I don’t consider myself “biologically female” if that tells you anything. I would also like to clarify that I am not suggesting anything as concrete as “male brain in female body”, since we don’t really have evidence of that either given that there’s no actual way of verifiably determining the sex of a brain. Simply pointing out here that human biology certainly plays some kind of role in dysphoria, even if we don’t understand what exactly that role is yet. 

The idea that both biological and environmental factors come into play is the most commonly held opinion amongst the scientific community so the burden of proof is on you to explain why you believe dysphoria is strictly social in origin.

Edit: Added a sentence"
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fb7er0u,t1_fb76k5g,1576587586.0,"I don’t mean to sound like a transmedicalist here but unfortunately sex is a real, fundamental aspect of being human. Our brains automatically recognize certain characteristics as belonging to one, and as trans people our brains are expecting something different from what’s there, hence (physical) dysphoria. I don’t think any amount of abolishing gender would fix that."

Psychosis is just a cluster of symptoms that includes stuff like hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, etc. A lot of things can cause it other than schizophrenia, like drugs, sleep deprivation, or other mental illnesses like bipolar and depression - almost anyone can become psychotic under the right circumstances
