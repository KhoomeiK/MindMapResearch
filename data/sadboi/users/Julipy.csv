>they are aware of reeducation camps, which is common before in most Chinese provinces.

Here's a response to another question on the topic that explains his opinion on the matter:

>It's not reported often, but people know there are problems of separatists and extremist in that region, and people are OK with government taking measures to counter such threat. Terrorism is real, it happened multiple times in Urumqi, in Kunming. But I guess you can say one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter"

legaladvice,etg3qgf,t1_etg2up5,1562783217.0,"It's a little hard to explain, but I've been given a project that requires frequent monitoring, which explains the weekend work (which adds up to quite a bit), and the goal of the internship is to complete this project. I've mapped out my project timeline in my head, and without working overtime, it's impossible to finish it by the end of my time at the company.

&#x200B;

I'm definitely a bit of a pushover, so I prioritized getting the work done over complaining about having to work overtime, but I think I'm starting to crack after last week.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Also, I'm a total scrub, and I've never dealt with this kind of thing before. All I know how to do is work hard and not complain haha"
legaladvice,etg370b,t1_etg2nzc,1562782914.0,"Thanks for the quick response - the startup is only seven people and I report directly to the CEO, so I guess I'll have to gather up the courage to ask her directly. I've kept a log of my actual hours, separate from my normal time tracker, so hopefully that'll help me make my case.

Thanks!"
Art,etfbf9q,t1_etf8aog,1562765629.0,"If you don't mind the advice, I think you do a great job at suggesting dimension right under the mustache area - would love to see more of this sort of ""grouping"" (not sure how to describe it ) of the hair in the lower part of the beard. The mass of beard hair still has an overall 3D shape , so naturally, some parts of it will be in shadow if the side of the shape is turned away from the light, especially in such dramatic lighting. I think you do a really great job on the right eyebrow - love the effect that the lightened hairs create!

&#x200B;

Also, is the man meant to look younger on the right side of the drawing? If yes - cool! If not, I think it would have been a good idea to give it some of that really excellent texture you capture on the left side. Since it's already so dark on that side, you can make wrinkles by lightening up ridges rather than darkening the in between, and it might give that nice lighting effect where the light glancing off the far side of his face in a more realistic fashion.

&#x200B;

I also would have given more of a suggestion of the right side of his nose - even though it's in shadow, I think it's needed in order to make the dimension of the face more believable.

Phew, that was long -hope you don't mind the friendly advice! I like this piece - can definitely tell you put a lot of care and time into it :)"

Sucks, I was just trying to make an order with an older credit card that I hadn't used in a while, and it looks like I'll have to buy what I want from somewhere else."
