They‚Äôre called Banduvloons and I highly recommend searching for them on YouTube, Instagram and Facebook. The live performances are SO much more than the recordings. The talent and lyrics are so powerful."

ptsd,f309xng,t3_deymfr,1570549729.0,"In my experience: Humor has been a double edged sword as a coping mechanism for me. I‚Äôm so used to using it to cope or deal with uncomfortable situations but it‚Äôs not always appropriate or helpful in certain situations, like medical appointments or disability hearings. üòî It can also be a little bit of a gateway for nervous oversharing, leading to embarrassing or awkward social situations. 
It‚Äôs important to keep your sense of humor for sure. But it‚Äôs something I personally have to be careful with as it‚Äôs become such a natural instinct and I‚Äôm looking forward to expanding my coping skills toolbox. I find wim hof inspiring for breathing methods and meditation techniques but I haven‚Äôt been consistent in practice. Kundalini yoga has been very helpful in the past, but I got out of practice and now have some serious physical issues that require further diagnosis and treatment ... medical ptsd is a whole other bag. Being your own advocate is of utmost importance but difficult when experiencing the spectrum of dysregulatory symptoms and coping mechanisms of ptsd or cptsd."

passiveaggressive,f159jv0,t3_d5x1y6,1569186639.0,Sometimes you just wish your sister would eat her avocados (and other foods) before they rot or get thrown away because she thinks they are bad because of the ‚Äúsell by‚Äù date. Especially when she is aware that others in the house are on a strict food budget of $50 a week.
