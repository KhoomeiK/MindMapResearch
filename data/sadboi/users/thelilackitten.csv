relationships,f8chaw3,t3_e02mzl,1574460222.0,"I was actually in the same place where you are now. I was with my ex for almost 6 years, and the end of last year I found out about this 'emotional affair' he was having. It turns out it was way more than that, and I was at the lowest point of my life. My family and friends said I wasn't myself, I was depressed and anxious about everything. I questioned why was this happening to me, what was wrong with me. He made it seem like it was all me. It wasn't though. I ended it with him, and months later I found out he had actually cheated on me for more than 2 years. 

It is hard letting the one you love go, but it isn't worth continuing if you will be constantly thinking about what happened and if they will do it again. You have to find it in yourself to let go, you have to know your worth. I couldn't forgive my ex for what he did to me, it was eating me up. It's been months since I broke up with him and I must say I feel better. More myself than anything. 

Open up to your friends and family about what's going on. You will need the support, do the stuff you love again, it will help."

Anxiety,f1v6go8,t3_davok3,1569767481.0,"I've felt what you've felt before. I experience that a lot with a cousin who I considered my best friend. They started to want to do things that made my anxiety start to act up or would say things that would make me overthink. I would try to communicate how my anxiety makes me feel, but they'd look at me like they never knew what to say and would change subjects. It would make me feel like crap, and I drifted apart from them. 
Communication is always key, and if they value how you feel and hear you out maybe it'll change. If it doesn't then perhaps it's time to meet knew people."

So calling in sick was always like pulling teeth with my ex-boss. I remember being really sick a few times to the point I threw up at work, and telling my boss about it did nothing. I always felt anxious when I would try talking to her about it. My current job I haven't got sick yet (fingers crossed) to where I have to call in. I do however get really anxious and feel guilty about asking for certain days off. I'm part-time as well with my current job, and I really need the money.

AnxietyDepression,es87x5v,t3_c6ejvd,1561690009.0,"I was on and off about seeking therapy since high school. In April I was at a very dark place that I couldn't get out of and I had enough of the anxiety and depression. My Mom had put me in the right direction of finding a therapist, I came up on a website/app of counselors. I entered all my information and it generated a list of therapist to help me with what I was dealing with. I choose who I wanted and we started to video, text, and send voice memos to each other. My therapist is really understanding and helpful in what I was seeking help with. Through all the little homework and challenges she gave me have helped me take a bit of control on my mental illness. I have enjoyed this journey with her and I feel overall a bit better, of course there are times where my anxiety or depression get to me but its an ongoing process."

ExNoContact,era8to4,t3_c1070u,1560638114.0,"I was with my ex for over 5 years, and starting last November things went from bad to worse. I found out they were talking to a person I didn't like (gut feeling) after I initial asked them not to talk to them a year or so prior. He hid a lot of stuff from me about this person; seeing them, giving them gifts, texting them while I was next to him. I found out the other person was hopeful that they would end up together.

ExNoContact,eqqe68x,t3_bz492t,1560218875.0,"I'm kind of in the same boat. My ex hurt me over and over since last November; emotionally and mentally. Since then I tried my hardest to have us work things out, finaly I had enough. I ended it. Its been 3 weeks, and I'm slowly getting better and finding myself again. Do I still love him? Of course, I try not to think about it but I do still love him. Would I try to work things with him tomorrow or anytime soon? No, the hurt I feel has been horrible. Do I get upset or mad if I think about him moving on? Yes, its understandable. I gave him 5 years of my life.

What you are feeling is okay, because you love/loved them. You gave them part of you, and you'll always feel that. Its okay, you'll figure it out."

I've talked to him twice since then, those times he has expressed he realized that he screwed up. That he is working on himself and he is changing for the better because he wants me back. Hearing that has me on the edge because on one hand it has me hopeful, like this is it he really means it. On the other I'm thinking, but why didn't you mean it those other times when I expressed my feelings and nothing changed. If I actually saw that he changed and actually feel like he really did, I think I would give him a chance. I know that is a long ways from right now to decided what I want but it is a thought. We are always going to have hope no matter which side we are on. I believe at the moment we should take this time and space to reflect on who we are and what we want."

I get lonely sometimes, but then I remember I needed to take this time to heal and to do what is best for me. I am remembering who I am and working on loving myself first. I do also think if it is meant to be our paths will allign again. Until then I hope they are working on themselves and understanding why it had to happen.

I'll zone out a lot, and it's like my body is in auto pilot to get stuff done. Except I'm just so tired and exhausted, I just want to sleep. I do have a routine I go through, and it does help me to try and at least get the energy to do stuff. I sometimes try and do something different that interests me or go somewhere that I like,l to get out for a bit. It doesn't have to be over the top, just something simple even, like going to the library or just walk around the area you're in. Small steps are still progress."

Anxiety,eofacht,t3_brhlxi,1558528608.0,"I recently got into therapy, I believe in April around Easter time. Since high school I thought about going into therapy, but I was always to afraid to actually talk about getting therapy or seeking out a therapist. My initial thought was I didn't want them to think I was ""crazy"" I was scared and it gave me anxiety thinking about it. I stopped seeing the people I love and stopped doing things I love, those around me said I was a shell of myself. One night, I was just so sick and tired of feeling anxious and depressed. I got on my phone, and in the course of an hour I set myself up with a therapist. She uses cognitive behavioral therapy with me, and it's a lot of work but its progress. My therapist is really cool as well, she makes me feel comfortable and is really supportive.

I am glad to see you are excited to take this next step, and I wish the best for you!"

I'd have anxiety/panic attacks because I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life or what comes next. It still makes my anxiety act up from time to time, and I have to remember to breath."
