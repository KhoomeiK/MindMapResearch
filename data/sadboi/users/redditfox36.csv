Actually it was a bit longer than that but I finnaly had a friend and with time other people have become more neutral towards me instead of hmm? unfriendly at the very least?
   Well I used to be an extrovert as a young kid and I just ignored everyone one...I mean at least the abuse was only verbal... Then I slowly became the introvert I am today... Never felt the urge to suicide, because I guess im way too stuborn to die without ever be happy..."

depression,f87w7tq,t1_f87p1ab,1574343804.0,"you should keep trying because you still DON'T know how it is going to end, you just know it will be hard, life is just like that, some have it easier than us, some have it harder, you're still 20, I am too going to become 20 in a matter of days, and I also feel like I haven't acomplised anything in my life, I went to a private college because my grades suck and I didnt't make it to the public college. I was only lucky enough to get a 9,5 in an exam just so that I could get in a college were I made no friends and failed almost every subject.

 I used to be a hockey player and I quit because I didn't like it anymore (I spent many years on that sport, and I still remember my small ammount of skill going down slowly), and when I had bad games my father got angry at me and punished me and threatened me saying things like ""Im going to take your pc"" ""you are getting worse and worse"" etc... Like I was really confuse at the time and I was like what? 13 years old? Should I get punished because I am having bad games? I mean its just a hobby I have... I am only here because I tried rollerblades at the age of 6 and I liked it but I couldn't do that at home so I asked my father for a place where I could ride them, but before I noticed I was in a hockey club competing with other teams...

Obviously his words didn't score me goals, nor extra playtime on the field but I regret a lot quiting hockey today...(I quit at the age of 16) Even tough I haven't made any friends either on any club I went to (some were friendly but yeah not really much of a friend, its just because we were a team and all of that). Maybe I could just put some extra effort to it you know... 

2 of the guys who were with me specially...  They were even worse than me and they kept following me to every club I would go to (our parents were friends), and one of them was constantly just bullying me and trying to get me down... to be honest I don't really care about negatives things some people say towards me (specially unkown) I mean I had many years suffering from that specially at age 10-12 before I moved to another school where I tried to start a new life, tried to get friends but instead It was going all the same until I was lucky enough to find someone who had the patience to talk to me on the breaks and forgive me everytime I messed up, a friend... I don't know how but I did it, that gave me hope.

His friends are my friends now and sometimes we meet and play D&D together or take a walk trough the city stores.

Well they are pretty much like all I have right now but its something... Its a start. But Im not gonna lie, im not happy yet, I want to have what I never felt I had wich is a family, I mean I don't even eat at the same tabble as my parents today and  I can't talk to them because I can only imagine my father shouting at me because of how much of a failure I am.

I don't even care if I finish college and end up with a regular job unlike all my friends who are currently on engineering courses mostly... I just want to be happy you know and I know it is possible and the reason why I know that is because I am still alive and as long as you are alive there is a chance for you too.

Well altough that the first time I confessed love for someone that someone just hated me for the rest of her life im pretty sure... but yeah...there should be always someone out there even for someone like you and me...

Sorry if my text is confussing..."
depression,f87ocsc,t3_dzi02c,1574338643.0,"Like you said, there is always hope. We all ended up here in this sub reddit for a reason, but you shouldn't cut all the oportunities that could be out there for you, I know you've also said that there are many fake promises, and you are probably thinking about that now if you are reading this but... You can't just predict the future, and isn't it worth to live just so that you may be happy someday? Many of today's millionaire have bankrupt a hundred times before they were rich! Im not telling you to try and get rich yourself nor me, that isn't what you and I are looking for... We are trying to find a happy and stable life so shouldn't we also try a-hundred times?
