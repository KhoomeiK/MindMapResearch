Just because they enjoy non-fiction doesn‚Äôt automatically make them a J. They prefer loose plans, they are a P.

They don‚Äôt feel like they fit in with any type because they seem to think that their predicament is unique and that they don‚Äôt fit in to any set category. Tbh going off that alone I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre an F, I find they tend to think that their experiences are unique to them and only them. 

Their interests are philosophy, psychology, and politics, which may lead to some confusion as to if they‚Äôre S or N, but the fact that they‚Äôve read so far into their type that they‚Äôve just confused themselves is pretty clear evidence that they‚Äôre an N.

Honestly, they could be introverted or extroverted. That one I‚Äôll say is pretty flexible and hard to pinpoint with their descriptions. The easiest way to solve that is if they self analyse their energy levels before and after socialising with people.
