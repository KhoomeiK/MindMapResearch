Anxiety,eu5ak26,t3_ceu91n,1563473401.0,"I used to feel this way A LOT! One of the things that helped me heal my anxiety was to switch the way I said sorry. Instead, I started saying thank you to everyone and to understand how I am. 

It feels better to be positive with your own mind. 

As some people say here in the thread, it's only a bad habit and the good things about habits its that we can always reverse them."

I sometimes ask myself where to find this kind of people, but to be honest, they're everywhere, just keep your good vibes, smile at people when possible and you'll see how good and positive people will surround you.

Life isn't supposed to be hard at all, we just complicate things. Imagine this is your last day on Earth, how would you like it to be? I always ask myself that question in the morning and it helps reducing anxiety and face the day with positive attitude.

Hope this helps and never give up on your goals!

Peace to everyone in this group."

Hope that helps :)"
