depression,fpdkj87,t3_gcnpaj,1588528799.0,"I could have written this post when I was about your age -- or now, for that matter. Usually I don't have much advice for others but I have direct experience with this.

This feeling hit me hard when I was 23-24. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 18, but have dealt with it for as long as I can remember. At a certain moment when I turned 23, I left a toxic relationship and then made a lot of realizations about my college years ... I started comparing my college experience to those of others, and feeling like I had ""wasted"" mine.

From 18-22 I was severely depressed and anxious. I didn't get out much. I didn't have many friends. I clung to a couple boyfriends as a source of validation. I was constantly tired and spent a lot of my time sleeping, accidentally sleeping through commitments I had made, and spending many waking hours feeling like I'd kill for a nap.

I could go on, but the point is that these years that I felt many people usually have the time of their lives were painful, difficult and confusing to me. I felt like this was a reflection on me -- A ""wasted"" college experience was more proof that I was an idiot.

I spent time feeling sad and fighting feelings of shame. However, something I'm so glad I did was that *I started doing things I wanted to do*.

It was really as simple as that. A big part of this was just gaining independence as I got older and stopped relying on other peoples' rules for what my life was supposed to be like. For example ... I loved going to concerts and events, but my ex-boyfriend didn't want me to go to any kind of event if he wasn't with me, AND he was very picky about events we went to.

As soon as he and I broke up, I went to every damn concert, event, festival, party, farmer's market, WHATEVER that I wanted to. I'm so glad I did.

Honestly, feelings of fearing that I've wasted time still bother me. I'm 28, almost 29 and sometimes I worry I've ""wasted my 20s"" chasing love. I just went through another breakup a couple days ago, actually, so the feelings have been especially intense as of late. Also-- I've had trouble getting through movies and podcast episodes, too, so don't feel bad about that!

I'm glad you posted so that I could have the opportunity to not only give you advice, but to reflect on my own tendencies as well.

I look back at my 23-year-old self being so sad that she had ""wasted her college years."" I would tell her that I hadn't wasted any time, and that getting out and living the life I want to, starting ASAP, is what would end up helping more than anything.

You're not too old. It's not too late. You can believe me because I've been in almost your exact shoes!

I hope that helped even a little. Feel free to DM me any time ❤️"

Re. the fliers, the episode said: ""From his office, he faxed and mailed 9,000 fliers about Judy from Maine to Florida.""

I'm assuming the North Carolina doctor (he's been described as an ER doctor) saw the flier when his hospital got it. Then, when he read the article about the Jane Doe found near Asheville, he put two and two together and alerted Philadelphia police. It's possible that if he hadn't done that, it may have taken longer to identify the Jane Doe or it may never have been identified at all. -- I don't find it weird, necessarily, but it's definitely lucky.

Also, Judy apparently had two very vague connections to NC that may actually have nothing to do with the case. According to Wikipedia:

>Judy's family could not imagine why she might have gone to the Asheville area. According to them, she never expressed any desire to go there, and had only twice been to that general region of the country. Once she had visited Jeffrey for a week when he was at a weight loss clinic in Raleigh–Durham; on another occasion she had accompanied a patient on a drive south as he visited family that either lived closer in North Carolina to Asheville or in a neighboring area of Virginia or Tennessee (the family's memories differ)."

& I'm with you ... I feel like every possible theory (except for the body not being hers) still leaves a bunch of holes and unanswered questions. It's frustrating, but also makes for great internet sleuthing ;-)

As for the body actually being hers ... I'm inclined to believe it *is* actually her, because what would be the chances that a body matching Judy's age, race and height, that had been in the area for about as long as she had been missing, which also matched Judy's dental records, and had an arthritic knee like her *and* had her wedding ring would be a coincidence? However there is a part of me that doubts, simply because, like you said, it seems so wild that she'd end up so far away.

I'm not sure DNA testing would ever happen, but I'd support them doing it just to make extra sure that the body is in fact her -- OR to show that it isn't."

The friend is an ex-cop. One day, he was responding to a car accident, and on the way, he accidentally got into a fender-bender. He had heard over the radio that the accident he was responding to was pretty serious, so he kept going and didn’t stop for the fender bender.

He got to the accident and a woman at the scene was severely injured. Friend performed CPR on her until paramedics arrived. He was ultimately credited with saving her life — she would have died if he didn’t get there and perform CPR.

BUT

He **also** got in trouble for not stopping for the fender bender — in which no one was hurt — because he technically didn’t follow correct procedure. It didn’t technically matter that he was going to a serious crash where he ended up **saving a life.**

Friend ended up getting some kind of discipline for the fender bender incident.

Anyway ... I don’t think anyone would argue that my boyfriend’s friend did the right thing in that situation, even though he got in trouble for not stopping for the minor accident.

workaholics,fhf9mqh,t3_f2msfx,1581539005.0,"Try binging Childrens Hospital, a former Adult Swim show. I think it’s waaaaayyyyy underrated. It was created by David Wain (Wet Hot American Summer, Role Models) and features his comedy style that I can only describe as *supremely* dumb — but I LOVE it. It’s also got Rob Corddry, Lake Bell, Malin Akerman and others ... CHECK IT OUT!"

relationships,ff7h2sc,t1_ff7apve,1579649389.0,"Thanks for your response. We’ve talked about my/our feelings over the last couple of days, and he was always very understanding and supportive. However, my anxiety levels haven’t gone down. I think it’s a “me” problem.
I have no idea if he’ll agree to take me home. We have tickets to an event that starts in a couple days. Worst-case scenario: I have the money to fly home. But I don’t want it to come to that.
I have been diagnosed with anxiety for 10 years. I have seen doctors and am on medication. It’s an ongoing problem I try to manage. Relationships tend to bring out the worst of my anxiety."

TLCsisterwives,fesc47e,t3_eqfvqg,1579363737.0,"On the one hand, I never understood why they did this commitment ceremony thing ... Mainly bc they’re always complaining about how tight money is.

But on the other hand, moves/actions that seem to make no sense are 100% on-brand for Kody (and the rest of the Browns, for that matter ...)."
