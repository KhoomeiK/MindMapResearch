adultsurvivors,f0perzd,t3_d623gm,1568833191.0,"Thanks for the response. Yeah I am surely needing to get some help on it. I guess this is a bit different though. I should have been more specific. I bite off pieces of my skin. It's not a wound or anything just repetitive biting. It's really gross and dirty. 
I was sexually abused by my dad for 17 years. I usually do it during attacks, it's most definitely related to the PTSD. It's relatively new though."
mentalhealth,f0p4axc,t3_d60nmo,1568826875.0,*on that
mentalhealth,f0p4a4q,t3_d60nmo,1568826861.0,Yeah it starts off that way and grows. Speaking from a lot of experience. You need to train your brain to create new pathways and work on a that every day otherwise it will just go back to the old ones and get worse. I would suggest constantly working on yourself and making yourself socialize or just go do things in public by yourself

Take that anger and do something with it. Run, punch something, create something. Really dude, anything. I get your anger probably more than anyone here. 
You do need to TRY other things bedsides taking out your anger in a way that will make you more angry. Please, for me. try something new today."

mentalhealth,ewvvezy,t3_cqdf4l,1565814775.0,"I actually don't agree with any of you. I think you should keep your mother in your life. I think family is incredibly important and whether or not you like it, family was chosen before birth. 
Now, I have been in this position. I decided to take time for myself, distance myself from the situation. Even if she has been abusive. What you should do is go to a counselor with your mother and talk about this with them both. Work through your past with her. Try your best to recover the relationship and make it a healthy one. Im sure she really loves and needs you too. 
It sounds like healing needs to take place here."
