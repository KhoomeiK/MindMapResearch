UnsentLetters,fis2nf8,t3_f9jx93,1582676405.0,I'm glad you had some kind of outlet to get some of your anger out.  I'm sorry man.
BPD,fiidhun,t3_f80z4t,1582420086.0,My journey to stability is still young but so far exercise has helped the most.  Iâ€™m able to calm negative feelings / anxiety pretty quickly now while working out almost every day.
RoastMe,fi2k00c,t1_fi2izsr,1582081548.0,Too true
RoastMe,fi2akb5,t1_fi2aip6,1582075297.0,I hope so

RoastMe,fi29wej,t1_fi29sb9,1582074865.0,"Oof, this one hurts because itâ€™s true... but I also want that to happen"
RoastMe,fi29jgb,t1_fi29cap,1582074616.0,This actually makes me feel a little better <3
RoastMe,fi294si,t1_fi29035,1582074343.0,LOL!
BPD,fhzy463,t1_fhzxzhf,1582017202.0,"I mean, experts preach self-love.  This is generally mental but honestly I donâ€™t think extending it to physical makes it wrong or a result of a mental disorder.  I think itâ€™s probably a good, healthy thing, especially if it makes you feel better."
BPD,fhzxrwz,t1_fhzxhdf,1582016727.0,"Yep - I get the fantasies too, like right away.  Sometimes I'll see a girl and not even \_talk\_ to her and I'll already have these fantasies of us talking and getting together, and I'll get attached to her - just someone I randomly see.  It's absolutely ridiculous."
BPD,fhzxqh2,t1_fhzxgzc,1582016671.0,"Good question.  Maybe just try to be more of an observer in general - observe the people around you, don't feel the need to engage all of the time.  Observe your mind and your thoughts and the urge to talk.  Just relax a little bit.  I'm not saying just sit in the corner and say nothing, just don't follow the urges to speak if you don't want to keep blurting personal things out.  Just chill!!!!"
BPD,fhzxe6d,t1_fhzx9zu,1582016194.0,"I just get really depressed and sad usually.  It hasn't really happened in a long time because I've been on / off with someone for the last few years so I haven't experienced the feeling in a while.  Well, I get really depressed and sad and depressed when the girl I've been with doesn't want to be with me any more.  I guess that's probably similar.  I feel like I won't be able to handle it and I feel like the world is ending.  I guess I _DO_ convince myself she likes / loves me still, but that is wavering.  Some days I'm convinced she still loves me and we'll be together, some days I'm convinced she never loved me and is probably looking for someone else to replace me right now.  But I'm rambling now."
BPD,fhzx88g,t1_fhzx42y,1582015958.0,"I relate to the getting obsessed part.  I'm not sure I completely relate to the convincing yourself they like you.  But I think that actually could be a positive attribute - if you act like they like you they probably are more likely to like you, lol."
BPD,fhzwy7d,t3_f5orgb,1582015576.0,"I'm male and get obsessed with women easily when I like them.  It sounds like I get obsessed even easier than you do.  If a woman shows interest in me I'm sure to get attached shortly after that, or even instantly."
BPD,fhzwsuy,t1_fhzwp0w,1582015372.0,"If you make the message similar to what I said and don't act desperate I think it's completely reasonable and actually comes off as more confident.  You want to know where you stand with him and you're putting yourself out there.  Don't say ""are you ever going to talk to me again?"" or anything like that.

From what you've said it sounds like he has lost interest, but he truly could be busy, or who knows, he might even think YOU aren't interested."
BPD,fhzwq1e,t1_fhzwinx,1582015265.0,"Maybe you focused on the other boyfriends that didn't care about you because you thought if you could make them happy and do what they want that they'd love you and give you the affection you craved from them.  That's generally how I am in relationships.  I think if I make it all about them and meet all of their needs, then they'll reciprocate it.  But it doesn't work like that - you have to express your needs to get them met.

Actually giving yourself affection and sympathy is a really healthy thing - it's something that I suck at and want to get better at.  Are you able to still do that?"
BPD,fhzwlp2,t3_f5oocd,1582015099.0,You should try your best not to put yourself down and instead just observe those negative feelings you're having.  It sounds like you need to take a step back from everything in general - stop talking and stop overthinking it.  Just be for a little bit.
BPD,fhzwiqx,t3_f5oovj,1582014986.0,"You must be super anxious right now about it - I get the same way you do when I like someone, and it's easy for me to get really attached to someone in a situation like this.  I think the best thing to do is to just ask him honestly how he feels and if he's not interested - I know that it's going to be insanely hard to do because you'll be afraid of the answer, but it's totally reasonable to do.  I would say something like ""Hey \_\_\_\_\_\_, I really liked talking with you and was wondering if you're still interested?""  And maybe express what you'd like to happen next - whether that's talking more again or going on a date, etc.  ""I'd love to see you again!""  Something like that.  Put yourself out there - so you at least are confident in what he's thinking.  And if he's not interested you can start to move on from it."
BPD,fhzvh7l,t3_f5ob6e,1582013595.0,"You're lucky - that's exactly how I am and exactly how I'd want a relationship to be.  It's not common to have relationships like that, but it's not necessarily unhealthy.  It's probably good to have a \_little\_ time away from each other.  But honestly if you both want it it's fine.

I'm not sure if it's a common BPD thing but I would guess it's more common than uncommon for people with BPD."
BPD,fhywwzy,t1_fhwzxot,1581985642.0,"I'm sorry you're feeling hurt and betrayed by this, but I'd invite you to take a closer look at this.  This isn't betrayal - people have the right to respond or not.  No one lied to you and no one was a coward.  It only hurts you to look at it in the manner that you are - those 10 people might not have even seen your request.  You can't jump to conclusions just because people don't do what you want them to do.  You can't control anyone else, you can only control your own feelings and actions, and in this case you need to control how you're reacting to what has happened.  No one was malicious or intentionally hurt you."
BPD,fhwwv5l,t1_fhtrvdv,1581934403.0,"Having a lot of friends doesn't make someone a good person, and not having friends doesn't make someone a bad person.  You should be more kind to yourself, things will go much more smoothly if you can manage to do that.  There might be things that you want to improve about yourself, but this doesn't make you a ""bad"" or ""flawed"" person.  You're a person.  You're beautiful.  You have strengths, and you have weaknesses.  You can, and will, improve the things that you want to.  Just be nicer to yourself <3"
confidence,fhww2od,t3_f53dfh,1581933217.0,I was a virgin until 25.  It never posed any problems and I was fine even the first time.  You'll be ok - to be honest I wouldn't want to be with a woman that would find it a turn off.  Find someone that is caring that will think it's sweet and special.
BPD,fhwvnzs,t3_f55sih,1581932599.0,"I am so sorry you're going through this right now.  It must be really painful.  I know how hard it is to lose someone you love and to not have them love you in the same way any more.  It's good that it's a healthy break up, and it's good that you did everything you could to be a good girlfriend to him.  I hope that you heal and I hope that this turns out to be a good thing and that you find someone special that you can be with forever."
BPD,ffw11ar,t1_ffw0vjx,1580279879.0,"Yeah I get that.  I'm the same way with hobbies too, I'm interested in something for a couple weeks intensely and then I'm bored of it.  Maybe talking to others about it?  Before it blows up?"
BPD,ffw013a,t3_evirog,1580278828.0,I have been going through an episode and I consider myself a quiet BPD.  It's tough for me if I'm not doing something that will occupy my mind - I've been playing basketball a lot and playing video games if I get really desperate and I'm just sitting in my mind.  Try to find something that will distract you if you get stuck.
BPD,ffsq1i6,t1_ffspmgl,1580188493.0,"I totally get it... the wrong response to a text or a late response freaks me out.  And my mood completely changes.  I'm too much to deal with.

I don't know how to have compassion towards myself, so I can't really give you advice right now.  I'm going to read the book my ex-therapist recommended though and I can let you know if I learn anything :)

How long have you known this guy that you're talking to?"
BPD,ffspjya,t3_ev0v7p,1580188050.0,I feel this.  I would have felt the same :(
BPD,ffsodf8,t3_euj6w9,1580187015.0,"I feel the exact same way as you - I just ended things for good with my girlfriend.  We had been together on and off the last 3+ years.  I don't think she cheated / ever would cheat on me, but there are things about her and the relationship that are just too toxic.  Yet I still desperately want her.  I want her attention.  If she messaged me right now I would be ecstatic and take her back.  But she won't because I split on her the hardest I've ever split in my life.  There was a disaster scenario that combined all of my insecurities, including her being untruthful.  I lost it.  I said the meanest things I've ever said, it was disgusting.  And I'm so sorry for it, but it doesn't matter, she won't accept my apology and she thinks I'm a terrible person now.  She doesn't believe that I love her more than anything else I've ever had in my life, she doesn't know the intensity I feel for her.  But that's why I got so mad... because I love her so much and I didn't want to lose her... but that just forced me to push her away for good.  I'm destroyed and I don't know what to do.

In your case, it didn't seem like this was a great guy, but I know you are incredibly attached to him and can't let him go for good.  I've been there so many times.  It's really difficult.  Honestly, as much as it hurts, it's probably good that you messed it up for (maybe) good.  We're both going to hurt like hell for a while... but eventually we'll meet people that are better for us.  Now I just need to take my own advice :)"
BPD,ffsfpiw,t3_eun06c,1580180578.0,"I'm extremely logical and rational most of the time, but do become irrational with romantic partners.  It very rarely affects my other relationships, but I do split on friends occasionally, but I never really act out except with partners."
BPD,ff57swz,t3_erpptu,1579582748.0,"I struggle with this issue too.  If I'm not doing something productive, I feel like I'm wasting my time and then I feel guilty about it.  I'm not really sure what the answer is but I think one thing you and I need to do is be more compassionate towards ourselves.  I don't know how to do that yet :)"
BPD,ff56ia9,t3_erp7t4,1579581628.0,"If you're anything like me, most people can't see your symptoms.  I only really get them in romantic relationships and internally towards myself, so it's rare that anyone outside of a SO when I have one will see anything BPDish.  Don't let it stop you from getting treatment!"
BPD,ff555h3,t3_erpbcw,1579580522.0,"It's not okay for someone to call you names and be mean, but it also doesn't mean he doesn't love you."
BPD,ff4aa09,t3_erkee2,1579558962.0,"I felt this way with my ex, and struggle with it still.  I want to get back together with her, but I know that it would make me feel more insecure, angry, anxious, desperate, rejected, etc.  There are just problems with us that will absolutely cause bad feelings in me.  But I don't think the solution is to just avoid a relationship because there are difficult feelings to manage.  If you actually like the guy I think you should try to focus on exploring why you feel the way you do in certain situations and see if you can lessen the intensity of those situations, or if there's anything he can do to help you not feel as bad."
BPD,ff480fb,t3_erk93q,1579557540.0,I don't have any tips but I'm in the same position as you.  I always hope she'll message me saying she was wrong and she can't live without me and she wants to get back together.  But it never happens :(
BPD,ff3r04w,t3_erhk0g,1579546976.0,"Hey, I have some experience with Zoloft.  I kind of had some of the feelings you are having when I started it, but I don't think nearly to the extent you're feeling them.  If you felt this way before in any way, I don't think you should be concerned and it's probably just your mind adjusting to the new medication.  But if it gets worse I would call your doctor.  I remember feeling VERY weird until I had taken it for several weeks - it takes a while to get used to it and you just have to kind of ride it out.  Things should start to get better once you've stabilized on it."
BPD,ff3ne0i,t3_ergunx,1579544767.0,"I'm struggling with this right now - I graduated and have a good job, but I'm so unproductive at work right now and I just got diagnosed with BPD.  So I need to figure out how to sort through this and get at least a little bit better so I can start performing at work and not lose my job.

But I definitely despise the corporate world a lot of times, and I don't feel like I belong.  Some days I get intense anxiety thinking about how everyone else is fine and successful, and I can't even handle it.  And then I beat myself up over it."
BPD,ff2gl72,t3_er9x6a,1579505240.0,I avoid platforms like that for that reason.  Among others.
BPD,ff2fpzv,t3_er9prb,1579504206.0,"I do the same thing haha.  I feel like the only person that would tolerate me at this point is someone else with BPD.  I know that's wrong though and I want to get better, enough to the point where I can have a healthy relationship."
BPD,ff2fk2e,t3_er9n7i,1579504014.0,"Hey, I'm in the same boat as you.  I was diagnosed last week, in the past I thought I may have had it, but explained it off because there are a couple symptoms that don't really apply to me (I don't self harm, and I really only have the symptoms in romantic relationships).  I can also tend to be a hypochondriac.

It's a little scary to be diagnosed, but think about the positives.  You now know what you have to work on.  And if you look up statistics on remission, it's not as bad as you think.  I think we just need to do the work, and things will get better :)

One other thing that was relieving to me was that I now know that I feel emotions stronger than other people.  I always questioned ""how can people hold it together?  How is this not affecting them like it is me?""  Now I know why.  And while it's not a great thing, it does mean that the love you can feel is more intense than the average person.  So use that as your super power, and try to control the opposite side.  That's what I'm going to try to do."

BPD,ff0kztr,t3_er2ky4,1579469807.0,"It sounds like she's going through idealizing / devaluing you and the relationship.  If you know she loves you and is attached to you, you can try to realize that when she's saying hurtful things it's most likely a coping mechanism for her to avoid pain and negative feelings.  It's hard though, and it sucks."
BPD,ff007xu,t3_er16ez,1579463730.0,"If you truly are happy alone and don't want to have friends or a boyfriend, then I think it's fine.  It's probably worth exploring if you actually want to be alone, or if that's your coping mechanism to avoid some kind of negative feeling like rejection.

I don't understand why you're calling yourself fake though?"
BPD,fezloic,t1_fezl5fd,1579458706.0,Want to trade brains?
BPD,fezkod6,t1_feziwnr,1579458332.0,"You're lucky you can move on from relationships quickly.  I honestly feel like if I never met someone new, I would never move on from whatever relationship I was in last.

I'm sorry you're feeling the way you do right now.  I've been there so many times, and it SUCKS!"
BPD,fezigub,t3_eqts37,1579457690.0,"I think you're settling with either one of these guys, and you shouldn't be with either.  You know what you want in a relationship so you shouldn't be settling out the gate with guys that aren't good for you."
BPD,fezhb23,t1_fezgk5c,1579457349.0,"I have just started so we haven't figured out what we're going to do yet, but I think I'll either be doing that or CBT.

I've heard that in the past people wouldn't even want to treat BPD - is that still true?  I don't really know much about this whole realm yet."
BPD,fezg3gs,t3_eqw2f4,1579456960.0,"I don't think it's a youth / inexperience thing - for me it was the worst it's ever been in my last relationship after having had several and being 30+ in age.  I think it could potentially be how you match up with this person, and he could potentially be doing things that trigger your insecurity / obsessiveness.  Or you could just really like him which makes you more scared to potentially lose him.

I know how exhausting it is to analyze everything and obsess.  I did it and still do it with my ex.  I can't help but read through our text messages and think about how things could have been different, why she said certain things, why I couldn't have done the right things to keep her around.  I also worried that she was only with me for x or y reasons, which totally don't make sense but I totally believe could be true."
BPD,fezewor,t3_eqwlkb,1579456608.0,"I do this all the time too.  I beat myself up for not following through, and sometimes I don't even try to make a list / start a routine, because I know that I'll just give up on it anyway.  But for me I know I have to just keep trying, because 1) if I keep trying at least I'll get a little bit done each time I make a new list and 2) I have been really successful at following through on what I want to do at a couple points in my life.  So I know that I can potentially do it.

I like to think that it's not that I'm just lazy, it's that I have such a negative mindset that I let myself get defeated soon after I get started.

We could just be lazy though :D"
BPD,feza6ld,t3_eqwdii,1579455252.0,If it's been 24 hours why don't you reach out to him?  He easily could be studying and just forgot to reply to your last text.  Don't beat yourself up!
BPD,fewlcm7,t3_eqsjq0,1579413487.0,"This could just be a temporary thing that clears up, so don't beat yourself up and say that your intelligence is failing you now.  I think the best thing you can do is take a step back and put everything into perspective - and don't be too hard on yourself right now.  You're incredibly young, and you have a lot of time to both figure out your mental challenges and to finish school.  When I was 18 I let my mental problems get the best of me and I dropped out.  I didn't end up getting my AA until I was 26 and my BS until I was 31.  I would try to get counseling if you haven't already pursued that, and if you really need to, scale back your classes this quarter / semester if possible.  If you have to retake a class, it's not the end of the world.  You're still SO young!  Just remember, it's ok to not be perfect."
BPD,fewkrf9,t1_fewkdex,1579412908.0,"If that were coming from someone I'm interested in romantically or my partner, I would go nuts.  If it's just a friend or someone else, I wouldn't really care.  Are you the same way?  Or do you hate that from any person?"
BPD,fewfmf5,t1_fewf5zn,1579409788.0,"Not yet - I just started therapy, so I'm hoping maybe it will help.  Of course, I don't have a partner or anyone to test if I'm actually getting better, so I won't know until I have an interest in someone again.

I ruminate and replay messages in my head over and over from when I was in arguments / fights with my ex.  I also read old messages still.  It's probably not a good thing but I don't know how to stop doing it."
BPD,feweh69,t3_eqrdtd,1579409243.0,"I agree, that's the worst part of it for me too.  I so relate to the texting thing - I used to constantly check my phone when I hadn't heard from my girlfriend in a long time.  I'd look at the time differences in messages I sent to when she replied, make up stories about why she wasn't texting me, that she didn't love me etc.  And even if she did something as small as use a period or not, use a certain emoji, could get me spiraling into anxiety and depression and fear of losing her."
BPD,fewbzv8,t3_eqi0yt,1579408159.0,"Humans love to label everything.  We want to categorize and bucket things as much as possible.

fasting,erdpan0,t3_c1jw6y,1560750754.0,"I'm not an expert on fasting, but I'd assume you'd maybe burn a little muscle initially, but once you're in ketosis I think your body preserves your muscles.  I've done two fasts (3 days and 5 days) and I don't feel like I lost any muscle, and look \*more\* muscular just because I was burning fat away.

keto,erdotm9,t3_c1jrpw,1560750166.0,"Are you throwing out the bacon fat for breakfast?  Though it wouldn't cut back on calories you could fry the eggs in the bacon fat instead of using butter.  I think cutting the cheddar cheese is a good idea, I'd leave the third egg just because it has good nutrients.

&#x200B;

Agree with cutting the mayo for lunch.

&#x200B;

Dinner you could shave a little of the ground beef out, maybe to 6oz.  What is the butter for?  The zucchini?  Again you could potentially fry the zucchini in the ground beef fat.

&#x200B;

I wouldn't go crazy on trying to hit your macros immediately, just transitioning into keto is a great thing.  After you get used to it then you can start scrutinizing the calories more like you're doing here."
