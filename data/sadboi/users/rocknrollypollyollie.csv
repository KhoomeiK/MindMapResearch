Wow. The wholesomeness"
mentalhealth,fq4k4ji,t1_fq4jm83,1589078775.0,Toxic? It seemed super well-received. It got taken down at over 500 up-votes. I am sorry that someone labeled your experience as that. You have certainly touched my heart. I see nothing toxic about you speaking your truth. Keep speaking it. Much love.
mentalhealth,fq4j9bo,t3_ggs39f,1589078466.0,"OP, I saw this originally on r/depression and was very disappointed to see the moderators take it down. I am glad to see that you have reposted on a different subreddit. People deserve to hear this story."
depression,fprwpdx,t3_gf3chq,1588863483.0,Now why on earth did the moderators take this beautiful story down?
relationship_advice,fpe4rlq,t1_fpdwzc9,1588540329.0,"Thank you for your understanding. I don't think B is that free-spirited; although I do know that she supports all relationships, so long as they are safe and consensual, including polygamous ones. I think she is just very, very westernized in her social views (e.g. gender roles, gay rights, partying). She has never not been monogamous though."
relationship_advice,fpdrsbz,t1_fpdks3g,1588532924.0,"Thank you for not immediately just labeling me scummy for trying to navigate my feelings.

How do I get a feel for how these girls are in a relationship versus our current friendship? Is it not scummy to become romantic with both?"
relationship_advice,fpdqynw,t1_fpdgnfl,1588532452.0,"I can guarantee that I am putting enough thought into this so that ""what ifs"" don't happen later on. 

I do not understand why simply weighing my options is a disgusting thing to do. I am trying to be considerate of people's feelings, so that no one gets hurt in the long run."
relationship_advice,fpdqcf1,t1_fpdpj7j,1588532102.0,How is this wasting anyone's time? I am literally just seeking advice. I am not the only person who has been caught between two amazing people before.

What do you mean especially her?

I appreciate this suggestion, but I agree, it wouldn't be a good idea. I know who I am leaning towards, anyways. I suppose it is just a matter of wanting something that I know is not good for me."
relationship_advice,fpdpl1x,t1_fpdou4v,1588531667.0,"What more do I need? Well, as stated, I need my parents' approval. If my parents thought B would be a good fit into my family, I think we all know what my choice would be."
relationship_advice,fpdpfof,t1_fpdk5tk,1588531583.0,I do respect her ideals. It is my parents that worry me. I am okay with the way she chooses to live. I actually admire her for it. But you cannot change culture. My parents see her as corrupted via the American lifestyle.
relationship_advice,fpdp88i,t1_fpdietr,1588531464.0,Imagine thinking that your implication that I am not good enough for either of them is going to make me just drop both of them. Isn't that a good thing- to land a girl out of your league?
relationship_advice,fpdfn8g,t1_fpdcoci,1588526056.0,"Why go on a dating site when there are two incredible options right in front of me? 

How will B drive me crazy?

Once again, I am not attempting to calculate or compare anyone. I asked for advice and provided my thoughts and feelings on both girls. I have apologized endlessly for sounding sleazy."
relationship_advice,fpdf7mv,t1_fpdcklu,1588525812.0,"This thread is crucifying me for demeaning and comparing two woman who I have romantic feelings for. Yet, it is totally appropriate for you to ask if you can ""have"" one of them? How is ownership less offensive than trying to determine which girl is better suited for me?"
relationship_advice,fpdewsk,t1_fpdbzh2,1588525644.0,I am sorry if it seemed that I was comparing the two. I am just throwing all of my thoughts and feelings down into post in hopes that someone can provide me with some sort of insight. Are my thoughts and feelings necessarily the most kind? No. But how was I supposed to ask for advice without laying it out like this?
