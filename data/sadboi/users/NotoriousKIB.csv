Michigents,fomqxox,t3_g7myt3,1587900663.0,"For me RSO made edibles work best for pain relief and sleep. Distillate Edibles give me a high closer to a normal flower high I would say, let’s me function and I can eat more stuff made from distillate.  

I’m 6’0 200lbs and a starter dose to feel something is like 50mg but my tolerance is crazy so like 200mg is what I need for real pain relief or a good nights sleep. 

I would personally try to find low dosage edibles, figure out what brand you have and what it’s made from so you can know what helps. 

Everyone’s tolerance is different my buddy’s 6’5 400lbs and he just can’t do edibles they wreck him even low doses. He’s fine to smoke as much flower though."
