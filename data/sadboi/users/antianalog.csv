bipolar2,ez4yydb,t3_czx8y7,1567694202.0,"I have a couple thoughts:

\- If you think the mom is crazy then what difference does it make if she thinks you are? You're not in a relationship with her.

\- His parents will always have his back before yours, so why take that personally? They have more things on their mind than you and they won't instinctively blame their son when they can blame you. I understand its more than them blaming you, but the logic still applies.

\- Regardless of the situation, your boyfriend is in it too. Understand that it is worse for him to be in the middle (sorry if that's cold). Don't complicate it by saying something he will remember later, like talking about his family negatively--regardless of your personal feelings. By all means bad mouth them here--because fuck them! We are on your side!

\- A future reference: you are going to have to bite your tongue and put in a lot of face time (or at least the same amount as before) with his family. It's one thing for them to avoid you but don't avoid them. You can do that for your boyfriend, not them. And their opinions are not important. You can fake a relationship with them when you have to. And as exhausting as that might sound just remember that it's not about them it's about you and him.

That's all you can really control. I hope he stands up for you. I personally hope that your boyfriend is not swayed by his family. And honestly it's probably not news to him that they don't like you. But that suggests he doesn't give af what they think and nothing between either you or him really need to change. You've been together a long time and that means something. Stay strong!"

Or they are but it‚Äôs short and uninviting. We notice things like that because we are hurt, and on some level reaching out for their assistance. But they‚Äôre not there to help you.

But you have to see the bigger picture. Step out of your skull and there could be millions of reasons why they have not responded. Inside you fixate on negative reasons. Outside people are just busy living.

People come and go in your life and that‚Äôs perfectly natural and ok. We are each on our journey and walk our own pace. Sometimes you try to have a conversation with someone from your past  but the timing is off. They can‚Äôt get to their phone right now. They‚Äôre busy. They might not be in the mood to talk to anyone. We all have our priorities and sometimes people have just moved on and are in different places in their lives. 

Texting in my experience is dangerous when you‚Äôre down. On top of the over analyzation of every letter, every word, it‚Äôs up to US to interpret what WE think they mean. And we are the negative Nancy‚Äôs always assuming the worst in people. Your self esteem has been chipped away  by doubt, guilt, shame, or whatever, and you‚Äôre alone. A lonely loner.

I make most of my phone calls when I‚Äôm driving around. It is a process but you have to work toward it and set yourself up not to feel lonely in the future. It feels like work and it‚Äôs forced but sometimes as soon as they answer all that stuff in your head just goes away and you feel better reconnecting. The people I force myself to stay in contact are the people who help me.

Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt hurt to preface a conversation with how you‚Äôve been feeling and explain that you‚Äôre reaching out because you‚Äôre depressed. If they are worth staying in contact with they should reply. Honesty is the best policy and you should be honest with your friends."

bipolar2,evryplf,t3_ckm35x,1564722930.0,I have a system with my boyfriend. When he asks how I'm doing in the morning I give him a number out of 10. (One bad. Ten good) If I'm on the low end of the spectrum he knows there's nothing he can do other than provide a hug or lay with me. If it's on the higher end he doesn't walk on egg shells. If my mood improves or worsens I can tell him and we adjust. I like it because I can express how I feel with no words and he can gauge what to expect for the day. It's not perfect but after some time it gets easier. And it works both ways. Maybe he's sick and tired of my shit. He can say X/10 to describe his tolerance level.
bipolar2,evrxxpn,t3_ckpfzt,1564722131.0,"I think you're partly afraid that you'll mistreat him but I also think that you are partly forgetting your self-worth. You have qualities that he loves about you. That's why he loves you and that's what overcomes the mood swings. You deserve it to yourself to be in the relationship that you want to be in. He deserves it too and he chose you. Don't sabotage your life because of your lack of self-esteem. Relationships are a two way street even if you're driving the bipolar bus.

I know the feeling and I feel that way sometimes too. Get professional help too so you can learn to retrain your thinking and to understand yourself more. If you don't want to do that for yourself then do it for him. It will only benefit you to learn and understand so that you can minimize mood swings or know how to defuse them. You'll be a happier person and a better partner."
bipolar2,evrw74x,t3_ckrkte,1564720450.0,I feel the same way! I look forward to the hypomania. I want to feel alive again!
bipolar2,evrvwla,t1_evrdm0j,1564720177.0,"Yes. This.

My psychologist also told me to realize when this is happening as well and to force myself to stop and do anything else. But this only works when you're making up fake shit in your head that you believe to be true at the time and foolish later on. At least that's my experience. It does work sometimes.

Sometimes I will just wake up angry as fuck and everything frustrates or annoys me. I'm agitated by everyone and everything. And it has nothing to do with thinking. It's all a reaction. Which requires you to also realize when you're about to snap and to stop and re-evaluate the situation. ""Were they wrong?"" ""Did they break the rules?"" ""Where's the rule that says they were wrong?"" And hopefully you'll realize that you have nothing to be angry about and you can calm yourself down."
bipolar2,evruzc3,t3_ckt4t6,1564719340.0,"Yes, absolutely! Even when I'm doing something I enjoy. It's always something just to pass the time and get the day over with."
depression,evruo36,t1_evq85xh,1564719059.0,"That was so sweet, Alex. Thank you. And I hope your day is well too.

I feel very much the same regarding not wanting to speak, not wanting to leave bed, and taking it one day at a time. Some days I say, ""I'm so over today."" And I crawl into bed and just sleep. I don't even want to finish the day. This is when I sleep the most. When as soon as I come home from work I go straight to bed and whenever I wake I quickly roll over and go back to sleep. I dream to escape reality, much like why I play video games, and I would prefer to live in this world.

But other days I feel like I never have any free time. I'll stay up to make up for ""lost"" time. I force the time and sacrifice sleep. Everything is NOW, NOW, NOW. I can't stop moving. And sometimes I have to call off work because my body's cycle is just way too off. It inevitably ends in me ruining everything scheduled, like work or appointments, and having to reset myself by sticking to a strict itinerary. Which will end up failing when I get depressed from the routine and start sleeping after work again.

In my 20's I never thought about the future. At times I figured I had no future. But the older I get the more I want to live and learn from my mistakes. But as you said. One day at a time. It just seems to get harder and harder."
