I had played every game since TS1, bought all the DLC for TS3, followed the development of TS4 closely. I was so excited. And then I paid full launch price for what was obviously an incomplete game. I realized I'd be expected to shell out for DLC to get the rest of the game, and I said hell no.

 I don't pirate games while they're still supported, because they tend to be unstable and the cracks break with updates. But when EA stops releasing updates for TS4, I'll hit the high seas. Because it's not *that* amazing of a game that I can't bear to wait a few years. 

Digital media creators need to realize that there is always competition in the form of piracy. Even in a market where EA has a monopoly, there is always a torrent.

NoStupidQuestions,fr04oc0,t3_glvtnr,1589783644.0,"You can pay a lawyer something called a ""retainer."" A retainer basically buys you a ""spot"" in their caseload, even if you don't actually need them right now. It ensures that they'll take your calls, answer your questions, and be available to handle specific legal issues as they arise. Retainers can be for specific periods of time or for specific cases. Usually, the retainer is put towards the cost of the billable hours of work the lawyer performs for you. 

Your average person doesn't actually have a lawyer on retainer. They may have a lawyer they are familiar with that they refer to regularly - for example, a small landlord probably has a real estate lawyer they refer to occasionally, someone who has had a nasty divorce has a family lawyer they've used before and refer to as issues crop up. But they might pay those lawyers per billable hour, rather than paying retainers. Depending on how often they need them, but I'll get back to that.

You may also hear the phrase in reference to criminal cases. In the US, if you can't afford a lawyer, the court assigns one to you. If you can afford a lawyer, you hire one to handle your specific criminal cases. That is ""your lawyer."" Most criminal defense lawyers require retainers up front to take your case. In general, people who get in trouble with the law on a regular basis tend to call the same criminal defense lawyer every time they get in trouble with the law, even if they don't actually have that lawyer on retainer all the time. They will probably think of this person as ""my lawyer."" 

People who have lawyers on retainer at all times tend to need lawyers regularly. There are lots of different kinds of lawyers, and it's somewhat unusual for a person to need constant access to one, specific kind of lawyer long-term. A few possible situations include a business owner who keeps a contract lawyer on retainer, a real estate investor who keeps a real estate lawyer on retainer, someone with a very contentious divorce/custody situation who keeps a family lawyer on retainer, or a ""career criminal"" who keeps a criminal defense lawyer who specializes in their kind of crime (eg racketeering, drug trafficking, etc) on retainer."

To give a specific example I played a few days ago... I made two roommates with a will-they-or-won't-they dramatic romantic relationship, wherein one becomes a vampire and they argue about it a lot - especially because drinking from sims tends to cause autonomous romantic interactions, which led to a lot of autonomous cheating. After one such argument, one of the sims had these four wishes pop up, one right after the other: 

* Kiss [Vampire Sim]

* Cast Pestilence Curse on [Vampire Sim] (she was a witch)

* WooHoo with [Vampire Sim]

* Be Mean To [Vampire Sim]

It was a startlingly realistic portrayal of exactly the kind of ""I love you but I hate you"" story I was trying to play. I've never seen anything of the sort in TS4. Despite the fact that TS4 has an actual emotions system, the sims in TS3 actually behave in emotional ways. At one point, these two broke up, and the vampire sim - who had the Brooding trait, which made her very emotional - did nothing but sob about it for two straight days. She would autonomously stop whatever I had ordered her to do, to cry about it. The witch sim also cried occasionally, but because she didn't have traits that made her excessively emotional, she didn't do it as much, and didn't autonomously stop actions to cry.  

Another example of the surprising ""humanity"" of TS3 sims. I was playing a married couple, where one was Brave and Athletic, and the other was a Loner and a Hopeless Romantic. At one point, a burglar showed up, and the Brave sim took care of it herself, soundly kicking the burglar's ass before the police officer even showed up. While the police officer was marching the burglar into the car, the Romantic sim autonomously came up to her wife and initiated WooHoo, completely out of nowhere, with no previous romantic interactions, autonomous or otherwise. I laughed for a good ten minutes - watching her wife be all strong and protective had turned her on!

My funny stories aside, TS3 is also better for decorating/interior design because of the Create-A-Style tool, which allows you nearly infinite abilities to customize the look of any object. You can change colors, patterns, textures, etc. So it sounds to me like TS3 is what you want."

The majority of the waste you expelled is stuff that was already in your large and small intestine, from hours to days ago, not the food you just ate. If you're struggling with an ED, you're probably not pooping frequently, and stuff backs up. Because all that stuff was rushed through your small intestine very quickly, you may have absorbed a lower amount of calories overall than you would have if you didn't have diarrhea - including the calories from the old food waste - because it didn't have proper ""processing time.""

One of my favorites in TS3 was making a Hydrophobic/Couch Potato/Hates The Outdoors/Coward sim (can't remember the other trait) and building him a torture chamber where his bed, fridge, toilet, and shower were all on different islands on a lot that was otherwise entirely pool. No walls or anything, and no artificial light of any kind. I didn't really play him. I just wanted to see what he'd do. 

Also in TS3, I would make pimps and hoes with Nraas Woohooer + Working Sims bed.

There are a few good ones, though, most of which are available on ModTheSims.

* Woohooer, another Nraas mod, seriously overhauls the game's relationship system. It makes WooHoo a skill that your sims can develop. It changes the way attraction works. It allows sims to WooHoo at lower relationship levels, so your sims can have one-night stands. And it includes the ability to have prostitute sims. (Download with the Working Sims Bed mod, also on the Nraas website, for maximum fun.) It's kind of like WW, but without all the explicit sex. It makes the game M-rated, instead of X-rated, so to speak.

* Cigarettes and Weapons System, by cmomoney and desecrate on MTS, respectively. Adds realistic smoking (including addiction!) and guns you can actually use to kill people.

thesims,fqoofkb,t3_gk16cz,1589520270.0,"In my opinion, TS3 is worth every penny. It's my primary sims game.

But TS3 has a charm that has kept me coming back to it since the day it released. I have it open in another tab right now, lol.

That said, I haven't played just base game since... well, 2009, because I got World Adventures about a week after it released. I bought every piece of DLC. (For the sake of honesty, I've played a pirated game for about 5 years now. I lost the discs/boxes/codes to my original TS3 games, as well as access to my original Origin account, years ago and I refuse to pay $400 - the cost of all the Sims 3 DLC - twice. I paid for it once. My conscience is clear.)

In my opinion, base sims games are pretty much all the same. Going from TS4 to TS3 base will be fun for a while - the open world and much larger trait system is fun to play with, and the playable characters/premade families actually have interesting backstories. But base game is base game - it's just families and houses and babies and rabbithole jobs. I mean, it's a great game for $20. But it's hard for me to recommend just base game when I haven't played it in so long.

I say give it a try, and if you like it, but find it somewhat lacking in content, get these EPs in roughly this order, depending on your playstyle:

1. Generations

2. Late Night or Ambitions (I would choose LN, because I love cities, apartments, vampires, and the celebrity system, but a lot of people prefer Ambitions because the CAS stuff it comes with is better and it adds a lot of new gameplay aspects, including playable jobs. Also, if you're not one for family-oriented play, I'd get LN before Generations, BUT, family-oriented play is a lot more fun in TS3, especially with Generations, so if you don't like it in TS4, you might love it in TS3.)

3. Seasons

4. University Life or Supernatural, depending on your play style. UL for more realistic, generational gameplay, Supernatural if you like the fantasy stuff.

5. World Adventures or Pets, depending on your play style. I prefer WA to Pets because I rarely play with pets, and I love exploring tombs and stuff. It's a Lara Croft game, but Sims style.

6. Island Paradise/Showtime/Into The Future. These are the low-tier sims 3 EPs, largely because they're the glitchiest. Island Paradise is an incredible EP when it works, but most of the new gameplay is locked to the world it comes with, and that world is nearly unplayable without a ton of tweaks. You have to delete a certain household, it has major routing problems that require mods to fix, and the ocean really taxes the game's graphic abilities. Showtime doesn't add much to gameplay except an extremely glitchy playable performer profession and a new world. And Into The Future is really only fun for extremely niche gameplay. Plus the traveling to the future and back is pretty glitchy, too. (Although the CAS stuff it comes with is kind of fun. TS3's clothes are very early 2000s, and it's funny how much they got right about what kind of clothes people would wear in the future. For example, the only leggings-as-pants in the entire game came with ITF.)"

thesims,fqjn6gs,t1_fqid3n8,1589412344.0,"> still get clueless kids to buy it

I think you're really onto something here. They're focusing on a different demographic, and that demographic is younger kids who have never played a Sims game. 

Previous sims games assumed that a large portion of the player base had played previous games, and they threw in a bunch of fun stuff for the longtime fans. Complicated lore, recurring characters across generations, inside jokes and references to previous games. TS4 has little to none of that. Oh sure, we have the Goths and the Calientes and stuff, but their personalities and backstories are drastically different - to the point where I've seen people suggest that TS4 takes place in an alternate universe from other Sims games, in terms of the lore.

They don't cater to longtime players because they don't have to - we're already hooked, and we have nowhere else to go. There's no competition for a similar game. Longtime Sims players want to play a life simulation game, and The Sims is the only one.

They don't cater to an older non-sims-playing audience because the interest isn't there - and because they don't have to. Video games are a saturated market, and The Sims has a monopoly on lifesims. If somebody 20+ isn't already playing the Sims, it's because they don't want to play a life simulation game.

But kids? That's a market ripe for cornering. The biggest games for kids right now are Minecraft and Roblox, which are sandbox games, and Roblox has some lifesim aspects. (I think. I've only played it once, but it seemed kind of like a Minecraft/IMVU hybrid.) So make a Sims game that appeals to kids - simple to play, simple to understand, simple Sims, simple build mode, make everything simple so kids get into it.

The more I think about it, I can definitely see how that idea trickled down from the Market Research division into game development. The cartoony style, the loss of complex build/buy stuff like CAS and world editing, etc. All designed to appeal to younger kids."

TS3 tried it with the store, and it was largely a flop. IMO, that's why they spread content that would have been one EP in TS2/3 into multiple EP/GP/SPs in TS4, to mimic the microtransaction system as much as possible. 

It's still gross and money-grubbing. This franchise makes money hand-over-fist. But all of EA's other big titles are full of microtransactions that are big money-makers, and you know EA is pissed that they couldn't make that model work with The Sims.

thesims,fqjer3l,t3_gh170b,1589408913.0,"I'd like to cosign the suggestion to focus gameplay around specific packs. There is SO MUCH to do in a full TS3 game that it gets really overwhelming any other way. You still have a lot of wiggle room to have fun with Sims 3's excellent trait system - get ready to enjoy sims that have actual personality! - and you can always follow the sims wishes in whatever direction you want.

I would definitely recommend starting with a World Adventures themed game. WA was such a dense pack that you could easily play several generations before completing everything it has to offer. Make a sim and give them the Adventurous trait and go explore the tombs in the vacation worlds. That's hours of gameplay right there. If you decide the tombs aren't really interesting to you, you could explore the Martial Arts skill with an Athletic/Disciplined sim, or play a gardening/farming game (TS3's gardening system is hours of fun gameply by itself) and explore Nectar-making. Best done with a snobby sim who loves the outdoors or has other gardening-related traits. 

If that doesn't excite you, move into Bridgeport. Bridgeport came with Night Life and is probably my favorite world. I love city play and apartments. It came with the celebrity system and vampires. The celebrity system meshes well with the performer careers that came with Showtime, though you may have to use Edit Town to add some venues. I'm not sure - I haven't played a performer in Bridgeport in a while. Anyway, that can knock out two expansion packs in one. Play as an up-and-coming musician and enjoy the celebrity system and performer careers, maybe turn her into a vampire at some point?

If you're more into challenge play, I love playing homeless sim/runaway teen challenges in Bridgeport. I really enjoy those challenges and I think they're much more fun in TS3 than in TS4. The open world system makes being homeless a lot more fun/realistic. Open worlds also make collecting valuables a lot more challenging than in TS4, where you can just make a lap around the neighborhood. If you play a runaway teen challenge, you can make it their goal to be able to afford to go to college, and enjoy the University expansion pack. These kinds of challenges are really the only times I ever play University - this and generational play, sometimes. 

TS3 is my primary game, so I have tons of ideas for how to get the most out of it. If these ideas don't excite you, I have more!"

* Eyelashes (s-club, of course) because my preferred default skin removes the eyelashes. Also some eyebrows and makeup, because I don't like the TS3 selection.
* Several sets of ""base sims."" This is more personal taste than anything else, but I don't enjoy fiddling with sliders for hours to make a beautiful sim from scratch - and when I do, they usually all come out looking the same. My preferred way to make new sims is to download a bunch of sims that other people have created, and then Play With Genetics with them until I get something I like. I usually start with sets that don't use any custom sliders and don't come packaged with any CC until I know how a new computer will handle that stuff.
* Some CC-free custom houses, because I can't build for shit, but I've been playing this game since it launched and I'm very bored of the houses that come with the game at this point.

Things I download when I know my computer will handle it:

* An ever-increasing amount of CC hair and clothes until the CAS lag gets intolerable
* Clutter and other custom decor
* Premade sims that use custom sliders, so I can have more interesting-looking sims
* Custom worlds, though these are extremely hit-or-miss in terms of functionality. Like I said, I've been playing this game regularly since day one. I'm sick of looking at Bridgeport and Riverview. 
* Other nRaas mods, especially StoryProgression (which is very necessary when playing custom worlds because most of them don't come pre-populated), Relativity, and WooHooer. The nRaas mods listed above make the game playable. These three take actual gameplay to another level."

NoStupidQuestions,fq80jhx,t3_ghcitx,1589156031.0,"To some extent, yes, this is possible. For example, a lot of very athletic women seem to have boyish body types because they have low body fat and very developed abdominal muscles. With extra muscle around the midsection and not a lot of fat around the hips, it can create straighter silhouette.

That's the opposite of what you're talking about, though. The thing is, you can grow larger butt and leg muscles, but you can't develop a wider pelvis or force your body to distribute fat along the sides of your hips, and that's what creates an hourglass or pear-shaped figure. This is actually a common issue with women trying to determine their body type. It's possible to have a large butt posteriorly (ie, it protrudes outward from the back) without having wide hips, so the front-facing silhouette is still pretty straight. (For a real-life example of a woman like this, look up YouTube Safiya Nygaard. She has a video where she gets a ""perfect makeover,"" and they have this exact conversation.)

A more likely silhouette would be something along the lines of female runners and bicyclists, who typically have very developed leg muscles. Look up female runners and cyclists and you'll notice two things. One, that many of them have the overall boyish physique I mentioned above. And two, that you can usually still tell which ones have natural hourglass/pear shapes, because their waists are still visibly smaller than their hips."

It's also very possible that the earliest  humans had afro-textured hair. When grown long, afro textured hair will form into dreadlocks by itself or with only very basic hairstyling, such as rolling, braiding, or twisting sections of the hair in oiled palms. Early humans could have done that."

I'm not downplaying or sensationalizing anything. I'm sharing the information that was not included in the documentary. Tiger King is not the first media to cover the saga of Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin. This is information that other sources included, because it's a relevant part of the story. 

>There's a lot of things that are factually incorrect here or just doesn't matter. 

I'd like to know what you think is factually incorrect or irrelevant. 

Some of these things are not particularly well-proven, but since most of that stuff is Carole's side of the story about Don, where nothing is well-proven, it's entirely fair to include. The documentary included all of Joe Exotic's accusations, and none of the rebuttals. These are the rebuttals. And many of them, especially the stuff regarding the unreliability of the people interviewed, are definitely provable. 

>In a documentary where literally every other major player is an alleged animal abuser, sexual predator, con artist, and/or felon. Carol Baskin who is also an alleged animal abuser, murder, felon, and predator fits right in.

Every other major player is a *proven* animal abuser, sexual predator, con artist, and/or felon. They admit it themselves. We see it on film. We have credible allegations of sexual abuse and manipulation from the people who went through it or watched it happen. They have criminal records that are easily found.

The only proven animal abuse we see from Carole is the cat breeding before Don's death, before BCR was even a thing. Carole claims this was all Don, not her - and the fact that she stopped around the time of his death supports that.

The allegations of her being a murderer are, as explained above, flimsy at best. It's definitely within the realm of possibility, but with so many other things that are equally possible, and no proof of any of them... I mean, ""what could have happened to the eccentric, allegedly dementia-addled rich guy who flew without a pilot's license and had incredibly shady financial dealings in a third-world world country"" is a very long list. Hell, he might even have chosen to disappear. Nobody knows how much money he actually had and he had a tendency to do things like hide large amounts of cash and goods. He could have taken his hoard and disappeared to live like a king in Panama with a mistress or some shit. It was the 90s, people could just fall off the map back then. I'm not saying he definitely did that - but it's just as possible as him being murdered by anyone, including Carole.

And there is literally no evidence of her being a predator, sexual or otherwise. Her marriage to that soft-spoken guy seems a little odd, but any marriage could seem odd if you filmed them for years and then only showed a few weird clips out of context. As explained, her volunteers are normal volunteers and her organization works exactly the same way other volunteer organizations work, so she's not preying on her volunteers. BCR's finances are all entirely public and above-board (it has a perfect score on Charity Navigator), so she's not preying on her donors or visitors.

The only people Carole Baskin has ""victimized"" are animal abusers. BCR does not target other legitimate animal sanctuaries. In fact, there is one not far from the GW Zoo that has never had any trouble with BCR or Carole Baskin. She targets roadside zoos, circuses, places that do cub-petting, and private ownership of big cats. And before you start in on ""but she privately owns big cats!"" I'd like to explain the purpose of an animal sanctuary. They're basically orphanages for big cats that need a safe place to live until they die. Big cats raised in captivity cannot be returned to the wild, and regular zoos cannot always take them in. When animals go to a sanctuary like BCR, it's because the only other choices for that animal are to spend the rest of their lives in abusive situations or be euthanized. 

You're believing the word of a known abuser of animals and people over actual facts or common sense. Nobody is saying you have to like Carole Baskin personally, but at least give her a fair shake."
CoronaVirusTX,fq1hi8x,t1_fq0pcpl,1589045703.0,"A 3-6 month emergency fund is several *thousand* dollars in savings for one person. Yes, everybody should have one, but people can't just pull several thousand dollars out of their ass if they don't have it. People who have never lived paycheck to paycheck often don't understand this, so I'll explain. 

A very large portion of the people out of work are people who work in retail, restaurants, and hospitality. Those aren't typically jobs that pay well, which makes it hard to save up that kind of money. It takes a lot of time to save up that much money, working a low-wage job. Emergencies are also not always conveniently timed, so saving up that kind of money takes even longer, as every medical bill, every unpaid sick day (jobs like this often don't provide sick leave or PTO), and bit of car trouble wipes it out.

Depending on the survey, anywhere from 40-75% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, meaning that they do not have enough savings to cover even a single missed paycheck. My personal favorite data on this is a survey by the Fed that found that nearly 50% of Americans do not have the cash on hand to cover a $400 emergency.

Now, we can argue why that is and who's fault it is and what people can or should do to avoid being in that situation all day long. But the fact of the matter is, that's 50% of unemployed Americans who would be starving or homeless right now without unemployment. That's part of why unemployment exists - people shouldn't starve to death or lose their homes if they find themselves unemployed through no fault of their own. 

And then there's the issue of the broader economic impact if 50% of the  33 million people currently out of work can no longer afford to pay their bills or buy any goods or services. That's millions of landlords who aren't getting paid. Millions of mortgages in default. (Hey, remember 2008? That's what happens when millions of people default on their mortgage at the same time.) Millions of repossessed cars. Millions of dollars that aren't being spent on electricity, food, gasoline, or any of the other things people usually spend money on. And when those business don't get paid, they lay people off, too. And then those people also can't afford to buy goods or services either, and it spirals out of control from there.

Social services like this play an important role in our economy. Even if you don't care about homeless people or starving children, it is bad for the economy to suddenly drop millions of people into abject poverty. That's why programs like this exist. 

So, maybe don't begrudge people for using a social service that they are legally entitled to while they wait for their jobs to come back. It's serving an important purpose."

What they didn't mention is that he had been loaning money to organized crime syndicates in Costa Rica, that he was nearly illiterate and was suffering from dementia, and that lots of people in his life were taking advantage of him. Including that secretary who was interviewed - she was embezzling - and that ""business partner/friend"" guy - he was stealing equipment and conning Don out of money on the regular. He was also abusing his wife and regularly seeing prostitutes in Costa Rica. He probably did get whacked. But the list of possible suspects is so long, and there's just no proof of anything.

Nah, they left out a bunch of stuff. They let Joe rant about her ""tiny cages,"" but they never include any actual full shots of what BCR's land looks like. It's really noticeable that they drop that point after the helicopter fly-over. BCR is huge and the animal enclosures are very large. The ""tiny cages"" shows are squeeze cages, used for transporting animals, giving them injections, etc. 

The shot of all the volunteers and visitors is set up to make it seem like Carole has an army of fanatics, when it's really just a once-yearly event they do, called ""Walkabout."" 

They left out all the information about how that ""trusted secretary"" was embezzling money, or how that ""close friend"" was scamming Don - and both of them particularly hated Carole because she got in the way of their scams. 

They left out the fact that ""Don's fortune"" was made *with* Carole, mostly *after* they were married. He was just a small business owner before they got married. She was the one who got them into real estate, and she handled most of that business because Don could barely read. So really, it's Carole's fortune. The money that his first wife and children got after his death was the money from the small business and small amount of real estate/other investments Don owned before they got divorced. They left that out to make Carole seem like a gold-digger. 

They left out that the restraining order Don tried to get was not his idea. It was that friend/business partner's idea, who was trying to get Carole to stop interfering in a scam he was running. The whole thing went down while Don was in Costa Rica. The friend convinced Don to try to get a restraining order so Carole could be legally forced to stay away from land she and Don owned while the friend was using it for some scam that had to do with, like, stolen construction equipment or something. That's why the court denied it. 

Most of this is well-supported with court and financial documents. This isn't just ""Carole's side of the story."" The only thing that is just Carole's word is the restraining order story. Although, the fact that the court denied it supports her version of events. But since the only other people who tell the restraining order story are con artists who have strong motivations to lie, they're not exactly reliable, either.

She's a ruthless businesswoman with a slightly shady past. Her weird ""meet-cute"" story with Don implies that she was working as a prostitute when they met. That fortune she made with Don was made by buying foreclosures and reselling - not exactly the most honorable business. She's also a single-minded zealot for a cause, has a huge ego, and is pretty obviously not wrapped too tight.

It's not really all that well understood how neurotransmitters affect us. We do understand the basic purposes of certain neurotransmitters - dopamine handles pleasure, ACH handles muscle movement and memory, etc - but neurotransmitters have multiple functions. How they act to perform these functions and how they interact with each other is not quite as well understood.

Some neurotransmitter imbalances are more well-studied than others. We know that treating Parkinson's patients with dopamine improves symptoms. We know that too much dopamine can cause delusional behavior. We know that treating Alzheimers patients with medicine that increases ACH slows the symptoms. Some are a lot more theoretical - for example, we treat depression and anxiety with medicine that increases serotonin and norepinephrine, but the limited effectiveness of those medications suggests that neurotransmitter imbalance may not be the root cause of depression and anxiety.

We also don't know how much of a neurotransmitter is ""too much,"" ""not enough,"" or ""normal,"" because it is difficult to measure neurotransmitter levels in living patients. It's also worth pointing out that neurotransmitter function isn't just about the levels in the brain at any given time. It's also about how they are released, how they cross the synapse, how they interact with receptors, how they interact with each other, etc. Neurotransmitters are really, really complicated and - I'll say it again - we really don't know all that much about them. 

>so that means that they're more prone to succeeding in life? like, they're born to win? and others are destined to lose?

It is possible that some people naturally produce more dopamine and have a more intense pleasure response. That is one of the theorized mechanisms behind ""addictive personalities."" It is also one theory of the mechanism behind schizophrenia. So no, having higher than average levels of dopamine does not make one ""set to succeed in life.""

Neurotransmitters are not the same thing as personality. They are chemicals in the brain that allow neurons to communicate with each other in complex ways. They may play a role in personality, but we have no idea, and we're not likely to figure it out any time soon.

It would be entirely inaccurate to say that our biology does not predispose us to certain success or failures. Personality, for example, seems to have some genetic component, and certain personality types will always be more popular/enthusiastic/outgoing. Athletic ability has some genetic aspects as well - some people develop muscle easier than others, certain body types are better suited to certain sports, etc. However, ""sporty, popular"" people are not necessarily born that way. Individuals and their environments interact with each other in millions of ways that create the people we grow to become.

 >What are the symptoms of low/high dopamine levels?

The symptoms of clinically low dopamine are Parkinson's-like symptoms. There is a theory - though it is only a theory - that low dopamine is also associated with ADHD, because stimulants increase dopamine levels in the brain. But ""the med to treat this increases/decreases this neurotransmitter, therefore this disease is caused by an imbalance of this transmitter"" is a big leap.

The symptoms of clinically high dopamine levels are less clear, but the side effects of L-Dopa are a likely list - nausea, altered emotional states, psychosis, and low blood pressure being the main ones, especially on high doses.

>are there any natural ways of increasing/decreasing those levels?

There are no scientifically proven ""natural"" methods to deliberately alter your neurotransmitter levels long-term. It's not even entirely clear if neurotransmitter imbalance is a direct cause, a related issue, or merely a symptom, of many conditions, especially mental health conditions. However, if you subscribe to the neurotransmitter imbalance theory of mental illness, then it stands to reason that good mental health hygiene - good diet, regular exercise, plenty of sleep, get some sunlight, have social interaction, etc - might have that effect.

>how do i know if i actually got imbalance of a certain neurotrasmitte?

It's really not possible to know if you have an imbalance of a certain transmitter. There are some ways to measure neurotransmitter activity using neuroimaging, but they're not really diagnostic tools. What they can do is fairly limited, and they're mostly useful for comparing neurotransmitter activity in people with certain conditions to people without those conditions. That science is not yet at a place where it can be used diagnostically. (Side note: anyone trying to sell you a neurotransmitter test, especially a urine test, is scamming you. Neurotransmitters do not work that way.)

>like, i think i got high dopamine symptoms.

If your symptoms are concerning you, or if they're very out of character, I highly recommend seeing a licensed therapist first, and then a medical doctor. You may just be suffering from the pangs of adolescence, or from difficulty coping with life changes. Being 18 is already a time of massive transition, and coronavirus has made that so much worse. Many people are struggling with mental health under quarantine. 

However, you're also at an age where serious mental health conditions, like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, tend to develop. Especially if these behaviors developed suddenly, it might be a good idea to let a medical doctor take a look.

>almost schizotypal symptoms

Schizotypal personality disorder has specific diagnostic criteria, which is necessary to distinguish it from the similar conditions of schizophrenia, autism, social anxiety, and other Cluster A personality disorders. It is a personality disorder, which are rarely diagnosed in adolescents."
NoStupidQuestions,fprh9zx,t3_gf4j2n,1588854104.0,"Short answer: 

There's nothing inherently harmful about explaining sex to children, in an age-appropriate way, if it is properly contextualized and the child is able to understand both the explanation and the context.

Longer answer: 

What ""age appropriate"" and ""proper context"" means is really variable. Part of the reason most parents wait until a child is older is because it's hard to explain sex in a way a 5yo can understand, and because they have no real context for that information. A 10yo is probably somewhat familiar with the concept, understands the concept of romantic relationships, and is familiar with puberty and therefore understands the purpose of their genitals as sexual organs. That is part of why the sex talk and the puberty talk tend to go together.


[This website has a really good article explaining what kind of information is age-appropriate and how to contextualize it.](https://www.heysigmund.com/kid-needs-know-age-age-guide-sex-education/) 

It also brings up a relevant point: The questions kids ask are based on the information they hear. All children will ask where babies come from - it's something they are inherently curious about, as they wonder about their own origins or see babies and pregnant women. A 5yo would only ask what *sex* is if they were introduced to the word or concept somehow - overhearing a conversation, seeing it on TV, etc. It's not something they inherently know about. So it's kind of a weird question for a kid that young to ask. 

""Where babies come from"" and ""what sex is"" are actually very different conversations. A 5yo can understand, ""Dad has something in his body called sperm, and Mom has something called an egg. When those come together, they make a baby,"" without questioning how the actual combining happens. If you have a particularly inquisitive child, you can explain in more detail, but kids are often satisfied with basic answers. You don't always need to give them a detailed answer to satisfy their curiosity."

The longest anyone has ever stayed awake is 11-14 days (depending on what level of scientific oversight you require to believe the claim). Many researchers claim that people who approach that record actually ""micro-sleep,"" where they will involuntarily slip into sleep for a few seconds or minutes. The people who approach these records generally either have friends keeping them awake, or are taking lots of stimulants, or both. Your body isn't just going to voluntarily stay awake for two weeks. 

Because of this, and other ethical considerations involved in studying it, it's unclear if someone can actually die from lack of sleep, if we could survive on ""microsleeps"" indefinitely, or if we would eventually lose consciousness no matter what the situation. 

The only case we can use to study that is a disease called ""fatal familial insomnia."" It is exactly what it sounds like. Once somebody who has this disease reaches the point where they are physically unable to sleep, they usually die in under a year, following rapid, drastic cognitive decline. However, it's not entirely clear if people with FFI actually die *of* insomnia, or if they die because of some other effect the disease has."
AskReddit,fppr53h,t1_fpphgtz,1588807547.0,"As well it should have. 

That's the thing about porn, and the sex industry in general - you *never* know if what you're watching or paying for is consensual. Even if it's a big ""respectable"" company, you never know if the actors were pressured into doing it, if they were told they'd be doing one thing and then forced to do another, or if the actors themselves were forced into it by pimps or abusive partners. You never know if that amateur video was posted consensually or if it's revenge porn. You never know if that woman in the video, in the strip club, on the escort site, is actually a sex trafficking victim. It's impossible to know.

Which means that every time you watch porn, you could be watching somebody's rape. Every time you pay for sexual services, you could be participating in someone's victimization. And if you're okay with that, you are a bad person.

A lot of people just don't realize that that is the situation. It's important to get the word out about stuff like that."

When it comes to the sex industry, somebody, somewhere, is always making a profit off of what the sex workers do, and whoever that person is has a lot of control over the sex workers. With the porn industry, it's the producers or the hosting companies. With camgirls and ""amateur"" sites like OF, it's the hosting site, which takes huge cuts of the profits and controls who gets popular/promoted. Camsites in particular are really gross about this, because a lot of them work on a ""token"" system, rather than direct money, which the workers then ""cash out."" But the camsites decide how much the tokens are worth, they can change it whenever they want, and there are tons of cases of girls having their accounts terminated, losing their tokens in the process. 

With strippers, it's the club. With prostitutes/escorts, the majority of them have pimps, agencies, or abusive partners who take the money. Actually, a huge number of women in the sex industry are forced into it by abusive partners - Sasha Grey is a famous modern example."

If I never time traveled, I'd miss out on tons of stuff. (Side note: the first time I time traveled  and saw the butterflies in the sunny morning... wow.) I usually just adjust the time 6-12hrs forward or backward every now and then to enjoy the daytime. Sometimes I go forwards and sometimes I go back, it just depends. Usually, if I'm waiting on something to be built/finished, I'll go forward, and then put the clock right the next day. If I'm not waiting on anything in particular, I go back, and then put the clock right the next day.

I really don't care if other people time travel or why they do it. The mechanism exists for a reason. If they really didn't want you to TT, they could have included a way to punish you for it. (For example, I vividly remember a real-time Sims game for DS that would punish time travel by spawning dozens of aliens - which were hostile in this game, you had to get rid of them - all over the place.)

A lot of the girls on the show come from rough backgrounds, but she came from deep, generational poverty. She wasn't well-educated. She wasn't ""worldly."" Her accent was always going to mark her as low-class and ""ghetto."" And in that episode and the one before it, you see her slowly start to realize that the fashion world is never going to be a welcoming place to some ghetto hood rat. (Not that I'm calling her that - just to illustrate what was probably going through her head.) She felt humiliated, like everyone was laughing at her... and they kinda were. I mean, having the losers ""serve"" the winners at Stuart Weitzman? The accent thing and the reading? Maybe she wasn't actually being targeted by these challenges, but it's easy to see why she felt like she was. 

It's an attitude I see a lot when lower-class people are thrust into situations where they're surrounded by higher-class people. They feel like everyone can tell they don't belong, like everyone is talking down to them or laughing behind their backs, and they get defensive and touchy.

You can just watch that thought form in her head - ""I'm never going to be anything but a joke to these people. Poor little ghetto girl who thinks she can model."" And it's heartbreaking to watch, because... she wasn't entirely wrong.

I'm not saying she couldn't have overcome that challenge, but she was facing a much steeper uphill climb than a lot of the other girls. She probably would have had to become an entirely different person. And with the weight of that generational poverty on her back - you'll never get out of the ghetto, you'll never amount to anything, don't try to put on airs and be better than where you come from - it was just too much."

The biggest thing that made me suspicious was knowing who Stuart Weitzman was but not knowing Hermes. Stuart Weitzman is one of those designers that people who aren't into fashion don't always know. His stuff is not a household name/pop culture reference like Manolo Blahnik or Louboutin (which wasn't yet a household name at the time, but is now). I suppose it's possible that they were briefed on who he was before filming that episode, though. 

And the fact that Naima messed it up, too. She got almost all the pronunciations right in that segment. They played her slightly slurring Gisele Bundchen's name as if it was a mistake, probably because she didn't mess up anything else. That's the other thing that made me suspicious."

NoStupidQuestions,forw3la,t1_forpjhh,1588019533.0,"Sure! So, some uncomfortable questions I would ask in this process are:

**What is the most common complaint/issue you hear from your tenants?**

They'll probably say something like ""Oh, just general maintenance requests."" So you'll need to push them and ask what kind of maintenance requests they get the most- is it plumbing problems? Bugs? Do the doors stick? Does the air conditioning/heat go out? If they give you the runaround on this, it's a bad sign. They might still give you a vague answer - ""Oh, you know, just normal things. Clogged toilets, leaky faucets."" And that may or may not be a red flag. It might honestly be the truth. 

**What are your pest control practices, and what procedures do you have in place if they're not satisfactory?**

Apartments have bugs. Always. It's unavoidable. One of the biggest ways to tell a good place to live from a shitty one is if they are really proactive about pest control. A good complex should spray inside and outside the units at least monthly. A really good complex will spray inside monthly and outside weekly. And they should have a system in place if you end up with a bug problem - will they start spraying more frequently? Will they kick you out to fumigate? If so, will that be on your dime or theirs? The details don't matter so much, as long as there is a plan in place.

**Can you share your crime data for the last 3 years?**

If they tell you they don't keep track of that information, they're lying or hiding something. A good complex will be forthcoming about any crime that has taken place on their property. And fact-check this information as much as possible. You may not be able to get the data for that specific complex, but you can look up crime statistics for the neighborhood. If they're in a high-crime neighborhood and they're claiming they've had no crimes in the last few years, they're lying.

**What's your retention like? How long do people usually stay?**

This is more just a test to see how hard they're trying to sell you, a ""vibe check,"" if you will. You can't verify this data, you have to take them at their word. If they start talking about people who have lived there for decades, but don't actually answer your question, that's a sign that you should take everything with a grain of salt. True answers to this question will be all over the place. All apartment complexes have a few ""lifers,"" all of them have those people who are just there for school or contract work and only stay a year at most. The specific city and community will affect the answer, too - in cities where people mostly rent, you'll see more longevity in tenants than in cities with affordable homes, where apartments are more an inherently temporary living space. Push as hard as you can to get hard numbers on what percentage of tenants renew their lease. They usually do keep track of those numbers.

**What's your occupancy/vacancy rate?**

This is a number they absolutely have - probably hanging up on a sign somewhere in their office. They should be completely forthcoming and answer this question easily. A high occupancy rate is a good sign, but a high vacancy rate isn't necessarily a bad sign. Sometimes the timing just works like that. (especially in college towns, every apartment complex has high vacancy rates in the summer) If they do have a high vacancy rate, push a little on that, see if they'll tell you what their ""usual"" occupancy/vacancy rates are.

**What's your policy on subletting, and do you have a lot of subleases?**

This is one of those questions to give you a feel for the community. Having a lot of subleases isn't necessarily a bad sign, but it will depend on the culture of the city/community you're moving to. Subleases are really common in, say, NYC - cosmopolitan cities with really aggressive rental markets will always have a lot of subleases. They're also more common in college towns, and a high number of subleases might suggest a lot of students in the complex. But a high rate of subleases should warrant a second look - why are so many people trying to get out of these apartments?

**What is the noise level like on a Saturday night? What is the noise level like on weekday afternoons/evenings?What are your busiest/quietest times?**

This is a way to get around the law, which prohibits landlords from disclosing demographic information about their complex. A manager will probably see right through this, but hopefully, they'll answer you anyway. If they admit to noise/business on weekend nights, you've probably got a lot of young people. If they admit to noise/business on weekday afternoons, you've probably got a lot of kids in the complex. If they say they can't answer that, it's actually a good sign - it means they take housing law *really* seriously. If they say it's always pretty quiet, they're probably lying to you. Even retirement communities have busier times.

**Have you ever had a problem with bedbugs in the complex? What is your policy on dealing with bedbugs?**

THIS ONE IS IMPORTANT! Bedbugs are demons and they can run rampant through an apartment complex. The only correct answer is ""No, we've never had bedbugs, but we have a detailed policy and procedure for how to handle them."" OR ""Yes, we had an issue [some amount of months/years ago] and here is a detailed account of how we handled it. It is not currently a problem.""

NoStupidQuestions,fmtxsgi,t1_fmtvqpl,1586380906.0,"We don't. Almost everyone hates the current system, including - and perhaps especially - healthcare providers. The problem is getting everyone to agree on what to do instead. (Including the insurance companies, who have a LOT of money and lobbying power.)

And therein lies the problem. The obvious solution is getting rid of the insurance companies and moving to a single-payer system. The proposal is called Medicare For All here, referring to the government health insurance that is available to our retirees. But the insurance companies don't want that, and they have a lot of money to throw around to protect their own existence.

Conservative officials cry about increased taxes, about increasing the size of the government to deal with something like Medicare for all, about waste and corruption, about the loss of all the jobs that ending insurance companies would have. Centrist Democrats give lip service to all the hard work unions have done to fight for their health insurance and about people who ""like"" their health insurance. (Nobody *likes* their health insurance.) The only valid concern is the loss of jobs in the field of health insurance, as well as the loss of jobs for medical billers. Most small offices employ multiple people for medical billing, because it's so complicated. Hospitals have entire departments for it, with dozens, or even hundreds, of people.

So instead, we come up with compromises designed to patch over the worst parts of it while allowing insurance companies to continue to exist. Treating symptoms instead of the root. Which really only succeeds in making it more complicated.

The thing to realize is that even conservatives hate the current system. I work in healthcare in a conservative area. I hear the patients complain about it constantly. But most of them get stuck on the whole ""increased taxes"" thing, and they will not be persuaded when you explain that increased taxes minus the cost of health insurance premiums/copays/deductibles you're no longer paying means most people will actually come out ahead financially. But the American conservative brainwashing machine is another conversation entirely."
