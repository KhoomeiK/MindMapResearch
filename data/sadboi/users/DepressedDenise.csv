depression,fctrbk6,t3_eir5wa,1577955472.0,I’ve tried to listen to music and it helps sometimes because sometimes all your focus goes into the voice of whoever is singing and maybe your thoughts could slow down or even go away for that amount of time

EatingDisorders,f2j9p1k,t3_ddah7f,1570269357.0,"I told my brother once that I was starving myself when getting weighed somewhere once and he didn’t really believe me, I told my dad once that I hadn’t eaten in 3 and a half days and he asked me why and I didn’t say anything and that was that, and the first person I ever told was a guy friend (now boyfriend) and he’s tried to help me so many times and then when I would restrict there would be one day where I would binge and still managed to lose weight which I eventually told him about and he knows the times I abused laxatives and the times I’ve tried to purge and now with my family they know everything and my boyfriend told me once to see a nutritionist  which I only did for him and it wasn’t really helpful because getting weighed gave me so much anxiety and because the nutritionist gave a little concern when I lost a lot of weight and that gave me more anxiety and each time I would have like a follow up, I would binge for 1 day or 2 and then restrict again and lose weight and I remember this one fucked up time where I ate something like a fruit early in the morning knowing my appointment was in the afternoon and after that, I didn’t eat or drink anything and once I went to the nutritionist and left, I got home and just binged on like everything ajjahah and to make this not so long, to answer your question.. in some ways yes but in some ways no because it’s I don’t know, it depends on the person because multiple times my dad wanted to “lock me up” and he didn’t but it’s just like if you’re a stubborn person like for example I’m a very stubborn person, VERY ajajha it’s hard to get better because of that but if someone’s giving you advice or options or anything of that sort, just try and listen and if you’re afraid of being judged like this is something people struggle with everyday with all kinds of eating disorders and they do the exact same things as you and if you’re afraid of someone “locking you up”, let that person know and only say it if you mean it but tell that person you’re going to get better and inform them how hard it can be so they aren’t making any comments on anything and I feel like this was a terrible answer ajajha but i tried 🖤"
