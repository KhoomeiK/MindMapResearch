Also, this is the 21st century. I expect satisfaction from every interaction, or at least to enjoy it on some level. That is not too much to expect, even if it is more difficult for women. Neither sex is more deserving of satisfaction than the other. 

You also do not know the entire story or the context of our interactions. We had not talked in a year and he tried to peruse me repeatedly despite my obvious discomfort and lack of interest. This poem was entirely uncalled for and, no, no part of it was good. It made me extremely uncomfortable. So, yes, I shared it with the world. His name wasnâ€™t even shared, so I donâ€™t think itâ€™s mean and I think itâ€™s well deserved."

I try to give this as a reason for me forgetting to text people or remember names or stopping mid-sentence because I forgot what I was even saying, but people tend to think Iâ€™m just making excuses :( my memory has been an extreme problem for me lately. It makes school and work extremely difficult."
