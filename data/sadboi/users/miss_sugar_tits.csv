Yes you should also be physically attracted to them as well, but the emotional connection should be everything.

I'm completely turned off from everything and anything unless I like the guy a LOT.

You're not alone, and it's perfectly normal to feel this way. A lot of guys just love a lot of sex and all that, like my ex, who always tried to initiate shit but I was uncomfortable a lot cause I didnt feel connected with him enough, which he got irritated(which is a HUGE red flag) cause I never went all the way.

If any guy expects any physical contact or talks dirty right away, I tell them to go fuck themselves. It's like a stranger texting you, ""hey how's your day? Do you like movies? Your tits look real good, wanna fuck?"" Yeah they're not there for a relationship. Maybe a fuck buddy at MOST. Its suuupeerrr annoying.
