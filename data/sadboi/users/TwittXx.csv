climbing,fr0wrnv,t1_fr0rrsh,1589808534.0,I love what you said about drones (and everything else). Years ago I was climbing American Bucks at Lion's Head. It was my first time doing a climb like that and I was a newbie climber.  I was on TR so my belayer was way above me and I was pretty freaked out. A drone came and just hovered by me during most of the climb and it stressed me out SO MUCH. One of the worst experiences I've had climbing.

AmItheAsshole,fqb79s7,t1_fqabzgs,1589231820.0,"I agree with this one. It sucks when friends become collateral when relationships happen and you haven't done anything wrong but he's clearly trying to distance himself to make his girlfriend feel better. She is very young and learning how to process jealousy and relationship boundaries. Maybe she is acting terrible but did any of us act brilliantly when we were 19? You know what's going on in his relationship so lay off a little. Maybe they will break up and things can go to normal again. You're trying to be kind but you're making his life worse. 

I have guy friends I was close with who got girlfriends that were jealous of me. I am still friends with them but I am not sending them care packages or texting them too frequently. I get we are friends but I don't want to make girlfriends jealous. He is with her romantically and that kind of supercedes my friendship for now. I'm still here saying hello and talking every now and them but I'm respecting his relationship.

Read back everything you wrote and read it like it wasn't you writing it. Would you tell someone to leave that relationship? She seems terrible! She is putting you through emotional torture. 

I don't know why she is sticking around with you, she is with someone else. I don't know if it's because the other guy is stringing her along and she's waiting for him to commit to her before she leaves you and she's keeping you around for security. But keep your dignity and leave. 

On another note, I understand privacy. But if I ever was fighting this badly over trust with a partner and they didn't just hand over their phone then it would be over. I get not going through someone's things and respecting privacy but at some point you show them the phone. If my partner thought I 
was calling someone at midnight and was worried I would show him my call history. People get paranoid sometimes and reassurance is fine as long as it's not ridiculous. The fact that she refused to show you her call history then lied and changed her story is so damning of her. 

Please just move on with your life. I know it will be so hard and feel terrible but it will feel better than what's happening now."

I learned later on of something called Love OCD. I would look into it! I'm in therapy and a portion of things we work on is this. 

Some things that helped me is I do not have social media profiles like FB or IG any longer. The person I'm dating also doesn't have social media so that is extremely helpful. Not going on a rant about the evils of social media but I found that it let my obessive mind run too free. I feel much happier without it. 

I also am very active at the gym and in rock climbing. When I get worked up I go climb or lift. It really helps refocus the energy. I talked to my therapist about this. I used to try calm hobbies like yoga, meditating or journalling. We learned I need something super high energy to take up all my mind so I couldn't obsessive. So I CrossFit or climb things. Some hobby that takes up all your attention.

AskReddit,f7q7f8w,t3_dxf5xh,1573959855.0,"I was walking across my apartment parking lot from my car to my apartment at around 3am. I was 19 years old. I'm a chick. It was a multi floor apartment building with the stairs and entrances outside. 

While I was walking in I forgot something in my car and turned back to get it. While I was in my car I heard a car with loud exhaust drive by, reverse, then park a spot away from me. 

I had such a bad feeling about that car and the man I saw getting out of his car. I ran quickly back towards my apartment and ran up all the stairs (I lived on the top floor). When I looked back he was waiting downstairs looking up at me. I ran inside my house and locked all the doors. 

After awhile I heard his car start up and leave again.

I'm convinced if I had lived on the bottom floor he would have followed me into my apartment. 


After he left I called my boyfriend who worked night shifts at a factory and he came home because I was so worked up and upset. 

I've also had a really strange instance where I was in West Virginia for a road trip. I was at a gas station and was getting out of the car to walk in. I eyed a shady looking couple who were watching people from their car. I had such an evil feeling about them I couldn't shake. When I was walking in they ran up to me and I swear they had a knife in their hand. I screamed and ran back to my car and they looked shocked. I don't know why I reacted that way but I have never had such a feeling of raw fear when someone approached me and I needed to get away immediately. My friends in the car saw what happened and asked what was wrong. I couldn't really explain why I was so scared or if I made up seeing the knife. I just had to get away."

I was in a very codependent relationships where I was the codependent person. By being broken up with and forced to be on my own I gained the skills to stop being codependent and enjoy life on my own. It was a very hard lesson to learn and a very hard time in my life but I am grateful I got broken up with so I could learn how to be happy on my own. 

I don't know if she is happy being so attached to someone else. It may be only my viewpoint, but that kind of happiness is very desperate. Yes her life will get completely changed but that doesn't mean it is for the worse. Maybe at the end of all the struggle she will have new confidence in herself that she doesn't need to rely on someone else for so many things. Maybe not. But in the end you are responsible for your happiness and she is responsible for hers. When we get into a relationship we hope for the best but we also have to acknowledge things may not work out someday. You aren't permanently bonded to this person. You can leave. And if you are miserable then you should leave. 

My ex was in the same position as you. He was miserable with me because I was codependent, unhappy and had a slew of other emotional issues. He left me and it hurt him. It hurt me. But years later I know we both are way happier because of it. We had a lot of growing up to do that we couldn't do together. Me especially. I am grateful someone was strong enough to leave me."

Good PSA :)"
DivinityOriginalSin,exoj084,t1_exmg5xg,1566477335.0,I agree with this. I got my boyfriend into the game and playing with him where we both control two party members has been the most fun. It is fun because rounds of combat take awhile and having two players each makes it more exciting.
DivinityOriginalSin,exoit2y,t1_exna9ig,1566477249.0,I started playing a few years ago and got really overwhelmed on Ft Joy and gave up until a few weeks ago. I started playing again and just had fun and it was a lot easier. Also don't be afraid to turn the difficulty setting down until you learn how to do combat well!! The combat is VERY hard to learn at first because you are ALWAYS on FIRE! So crank it down and just have fun and enjoy the fun dialogue and story and get a feel for fighting. Going Lone Wolf makes things easier if you don't want to navigate a party.
