ptsd,fmzx9b3,t1_fmzj7wa,1586531396.0,DUDE my best friend went through this a couple years ago. it was intense.
ptsd,fmzx6dy,t1_fmzmm8h,1586531350.0,"prazosin looks like it's similar to clonodine, which i recently started. each night i do a flexiril, baclofin, and clonidine, and they have really really helped me sleep better. it's crazy to me that I can take so many sedating things and still not just pass out. lately i've added benedryl for my allergies too lol. but i take adderall for adhd, so i'm trying to counteract that. but taking muscle relaxers consistently has been the best thing for me. i think i've been working through a fibromyalgia flare triggered by the traumatic events, and the combination of these drugs help me get the deep restorative sleep i need."
ptsd,fmzwtjr,t1_fmzokhq,1586531147.0,"omg i had a separated rib from the seat belt in a car accident, and it injured my diaphragm. I would randomly have little hyperventilation breaths for months after. it sucks so bad. 

&#x200B;

have you not tried muscle relaxers? flexiril is so great."
ptsd,fmsti6j,t3_fwqvkv,1586361762.0,"yes! i feel kinda bad that my mental health is the best it's been in a long time while the world is burning down. But i think my life burned down a few years ago, and so i've already been there. before I was able to work from home, I didn't realize how much it was getting to me. I felt like a tornado was touching down and nobody wanted to go to the basement. but once i was able to control my environment, i was able to relax. i've been quarantined for about a month now. now i feel a deep sense of gratitude that i'm in the position to stay home and can feel safe."
PMDD,fmozve6,t3_fw9aoz,1586271727.0,"i think it has to be progesterone. apparently it's really bad for acne, which explains why my face got super gross on the mirena iud. i took it out in september and have been learning about my cycle ever since. i've noticed my week three is so much worse than my week 4, which i think means i'm super sensitive to the progesterone. i take spirolactone for my hormonal acne, which has helped a ton. I also use differin in the evening. my face has gotten a lot better. i do notice my vulva gets super itchy around week three. i think the drop in estrogen doesn't help. I downloaded the hormonology app to track the changes each month, and it's really great."
ptsd,fmcrb1g,t3_fue84g,1585951261.0,"oh man, i'm so sorry. i would be feeling like that too if I had your medical history. My ptsd was triggered just by virtue of not feeling safe in my office, and I don't have your history. My psych prescribed me clonidine at night, and it's really really helped. not sure if therapy is a no go because you don't have insurance. but if you have a gp, maybe they'd be willing to send some out for you. it's a blood pressure med, so not restricted. 

&#x200B;

i'm so so sorry. you are totally not alone. my friend that survived breast cancer is having a hell of a time too. I think the world will have ptsd when this is over. you are doing amazing."

Portland,flfgxwl,t1_flfgfxu,1585106294.0,"AND a bunch of people touching the same phone book to rip out a page to use to then turn off a sink is safer? it's absurd! people today just want to poke holes in shit just to feel smart, but if all we do is shit on everything because it doesn't live up to some bullshit platonic ideal of the perfect IMPROVISED SINK then we don't get the net gain of having the improvised sink in the first place. this entire dialogue is the platonic ideal of what is wrong with portland's politics."
Portland,flfgfxu,t1_flfffwr,1585105932.0,"like, ok, let's say it's absolutely necessary to have a clean sink handle after washing your hands. the person that is of the mindset where they would use a paper towel after washing their hands to turn off the sink, could just as easily use the soap and water in their hands to clean the sink handle and then turn it off. the soap ruptures the outer envelop of the virus, and is legit going to do more than a paper towel that then has to be thrown away. 

having an imperfect sink with soap > no sink."
Portland,flfg6zv,t1_flfffwr,1585105752.0,"yeah, and elevators aren't sinks with soap. for christ sake. having a sink that is not perfect > having no sink"
ABraThatFits,flfep0p,t1_flfbfi9,1585104683.0,"yeah, the straps and the bands will stretch over time. so when you buy it new, you should be starting on the loosest hooks on the band, because those extra hooks are for when it stretches out. all elastic eventually loses elasticity over a long enough period of time. and you want your straps to be only about two finger widths when pulled off your shoulder. they too will stretch, so you don't want them too loose right away."
Portland,flf8oxd,t1_flewv8f,1585100564.0,"what reality do you live in that a phone book should be provided to turn off a spigot? you would rather withhold the capacity for someone to wash their hands because the risk of touching a spigot is more dangerous than just not washing your hands? like excess soapy water isn't regularly coming in contact with the spigot? but sure, we should totally just not provide sinks because we need to wait for someone to do a study on it."
ABraThatFits,flf8igi,t1_flewnko,1585100443.0,"no, i went to the pencil test in portland and she set me up with ones to try and tested my fit. she says you want the band to be snug, and it needs to be broken in like a shoe. and a lot of the tissue along the sides are breast tissue that you scoop up into the cup. but i'm all in the cup, it's not a push up. I think it's a bit different than what we normally think of as a bra to have the cup support/encase the entire breast."
ptsd,flew63u,t1_flep83m,1585092746.0,"i agree with you. yeah i tried hydroxyzine and wasn't noticing anything, and we moved to clonidine for me, and i'm in love with it. she may also try a beta blocker if she doesn't have asthma. there are so many great things to try before xanax. xanax is really a break glass in case of emergency tool. i have a lot of xanax available to me, but i'm really careful as to when I use it. I don't want to build up a tolerance, I want it to work when I need it to work. kava root drops are a great otc alternative to xanax too. but xanax really needs to be a last resort whenever possible."
ptsd,flevqat,t3_foatjr,1585092492.0,"I legit broke down and went off on my boss, and my psych says it sounded like a ptsd reaction. i'm working from home now and some things have changed at work, and i'm feeling so much safer. i was afraid because my boss is conservative and was brushing it off, and i realized I just didn't trust that he would be smart or capable enough to ensure our safety. there were other things i wrapped into it from previous situations, especially when I was severely injured from a car accident. since i've started working from home and I'm in control of my environment, i'm feeling so much better. I also added clonidine to my lexapro, which has helped so much. my blood pressure and resting heart rate have gone down. so this isn't stupid. i completely understand. i hope you can find a way to feel safe."
ABraThatFits,flev847,t3_foatjp,1585092203.0,I just went from like a 36C to a 34DD. my mind was blown.
Portland,fleuqgq,t1_fletr29,1585091924.0,I would rather die of the virus and live my entire life that worried about germs. this sink is better than no sink.
Portland,flesgiv,t1_fle9i0r,1585090622.0,"dude, you did a great job. we can microjudge every nuance of something, but by this logic all sinks are death traps and what is the point of ever washing your hands ever? something is better than nothing, you did good. the phonebook idea is insane."
Portland,flesapu,t1_fle6agh,1585090527.0,"idk man, by that logic any sink is just as dangerous as it is helpful."
Portland,fles3cx,t1_fle0bw0,1585090406.0,"i was going to say, that's a disproportionate amount of soap to water, but watered down bronners ftw! got that in my bathroom right now. when all this went down and i remembered I had half a large bottle of bronners, i was like aw i'm good for a year..."

I read just now that prilosec actually can help protect the stomach, but they don't want people taking it more than ten days straight. that's why people with rheumatoid arthritis can't just take lots of advil indefinitely."

TalkTherapy,finu79i,t1_fin2my0,1582570257.0,but you don't know what your coworker's situation is either. maybe they are in crisis and the therapist is making an exception for your coworker's extenuating circumstances. maybe your therapist also cancelled an appointment with your coworker and is making an exception to make up for the cancellation. my therapist waived a cancellation fee for me because she has cancelled on me multiple times for personal reasons.

TMJ,fi7kvfa,t3_f6vy8x,1582223292.0,"idk, but i've been told part of my bruxism problems are that my jaw is too mobile. one ortho told me to stop biting my lip, which i'd do when anxious and stuff. i've found that the more mindful i am about jaw mobility, the less i knock my teeth together. my hardcore nightguard helps, but there are times i've really had bad daytime grinding. my massage therapist did teach me technique to get my jaw muscles to release though. also i recommend a chiropractor for your neck. look for one that does nucca  [https://nucca.org/](https://nucca.org/)"
Dentistry,fi77boc,t1_fi75zl1,1582215771.0,"ps i'm just someone who had an abscessed on a root canaled tooth and spent money on two apicos, got two free, and finally had to get an implant. might as well go straight to the implant in my opinion. it sounds like my infection was not as bad as yours either. they were able to put my implant in at extraction, i guess i didn't have much bone loss. so yours sounds much more complicated."
Dentistry,fi75zl1,t3_f6n2eu,1582214998.0,"def skip the apicos, there is no point. i'm sure when they take the tooth out and put in some bone grafts, you'll be able to eventually get an implant. seems like you're still young enough to regenerate bone pretty well. if you use tobacco, STOP NOW. it restricts blood flow and makes everything take longer to heal. spending that much money on dental stuff is not worth risking with tobacco."

My junior year of high school I was in lit class and we were discussing On Walden Pond. This kid in my class raises his hand and says, ""Money can't listen to your problems like friends can."" The teacher went overboard with praise, cooing that he was going to be a contemporary philosopher. But that kid's dad owned a chain of frozen custard stands, and this kid drove any number of his dad's vintage cars the TWO blocks from his house to school every day. From the back of the class I said, ""Says the rich kid."" The teacher made me apologize. By the end of the class, this ""contemporary philosopher"" had fallen asleep, and the teacher went to go wake him up. I said to the teacher, ""Gee, it must be exhausting throwing Jack Handy quotes out all the time."" The teacher rolled up her papers and smacked me on the head with them. I took that to mean she knew, deep down, that I was right."
