Frugal,fgegnvo,t1_fgef98j,1580699106.0,"Well, that’s not what I eat all day. Haha.

That was my food for the day. For size, I am a good 240 and 5’7”. I am trying to lose weight. Light activity for 30 minutes."

Only a few around here have drive-through, so I don’t go there instead of other places."

Edit: I can’t use English today, and I am a native speaker."
