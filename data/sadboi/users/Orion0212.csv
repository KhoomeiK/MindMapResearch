mypartneristrans,fpw51eq,t1_fpw0rgy,1588957376.0,Yeah. I just hate that men like this guy think it’s ok to just touch their partners genitals when they feel like it.
mypartneristrans,fpvsj4n,t1_fpvcmo7,1588951045.0,That’s men for you. No always means yes. No respect for privacy of women.
AMA,fpd5ahw,t1_fpc9olp,1588520134.0,I’m ok with it.
AMA,fp71y1h,t1_fp71w78,1588362570.0,They met online

AMA,fp6uzx4,t1_fp6uru6,1588359050.0,She just one night told me she’s going on a date. I asked about the guy the next day and she told me everything.
AMA,fp6urhz,t1_fp6sa4u,1588358936.0,Well that wasn’t a question was it.
AMA,fp6un94,t1_fp6r7r3,1588358880.0,Yes I am straight. What do you mean what she told me and how?
AMA,fp6uh4y,t1_fp6sor2,1588358798.0,That’s cool! I’d love to move to Finland one day.
AMA,fp6qeus,t1_fp6qc9m,1588356795.0,I’m a boy
AMA,fp6q9ao,t1_fp6q2nx,1588356718.0,That’s awesome! What part do you live in?
AMA,fp6pn2o,t1_fp6pl38,1588356417.0,True. Practically then.
AMA,fp6plh6,t3_gbkl0m,1588356395.0,What’s the best thing about living in Finland?
depression,fomecit,t1_fom50g5,1587886967.0,Exactly!
depression,fome81p,t1_fom7on2,1587886842.0,I wish I could have friends.
depression,fohngqf,t1_fogmhxm,1587768971.0,"Yeah you’re right. She can date whoever she wants. She is happy with him. I’m happy she’s happy. I can’t do counselling because of the virus unfortunately, I will after the quarantine ends. I’ve began to accept the relationship. As I said my mom is happy with him and loves him so I’m happy for her. I mean, he is out there working, even during the quarantine, providing for me and my mom and supporting us. He’s taking care of us. So I really can’t hate him since he obviously does care about me and my mom. Still not sure about the sex stuff though, I’m trying to get over it."
depression,fmss2zx,t1_fms5we0,1586361113.0,Same
depression,fmsrour,t3_fx1mos,1586360931.0,"I’m in your exact situation. The world is rigged against people like us. I’ll never be happy, I know it. If I ever get some sort of illness, I’m just gonna let myself die. I’m struggling to build up the courage to kill myself unfortunately."
AskReddit,fm87tpx,t1_fm83312,1585844421.0,I’ve seen questions like this asked before and nobody had trouble answering. Nobody knows who you are.
mentalhealth,fm2neuy,t1_fm2ndfy,1585701125.0,He’s lying
mentalhealth,flj5142,t1_fliz5oz,1585199122.0,Thanks

mentalhealth,fli67yk,t1_fli4f00,1585176112.0,I’ll do that
mentalhealth,fli3zqv,t1_fli3rqt,1585174877.0,That’s literally what’s happening to me. I’m really having trouble finding people that do take me seriously.
mentalillness,fli3eig,t1_flhzhgh,1585174558.0,Thank you
mentalhealth,fli392t,t1_fli319r,1585174478.0,No I’ve been officially diagnosed with major depression
mentalillness,flhrjn8,t1_flhj9r1,1585168161.0,What?
mentalhealth,flhrhlk,t1_flhptaj,1585168132.0,Thank you. I’m kinda passive and bad at confrontation so I was afraid to say anything to her.
depression,fkt4owg,t1_fkt46mu,1584506180.0,You nailed it
depression,fkt3fhz,t1_fkstipt,1584505156.0,Message me. It would take really long to go through all of them
depression,fkt39wc,t1_fksvk1n,1584505035.0,A depression place is the last place you’d expect people to treat you like trash. It’s unfair
depression,fkss75o,t1_fkss5ry,1584497164.0,Quite a bit
depression,fkss556,t1_fkss2mg,1584497126.0,I’ve got to see it
depression,fkss30u,t1_fkss0u2,1584497087.0,Quite a lot
depression,fko57s2,t3_fj8jx2,1584380342.0,"For me it’s angry and aggressive music, like extreme metal. I always feel better after listening to some."
depression,fko51e6,t3_fjlg1n,1584380244.0,Well I’ve never had a single friend in my life so I wouldn’t care
depression,fko4yi2,t3_fjkbak,1584380199.0,"You got it. I hate it when people tell me that. It’s obviously not true. Anyone who says that is lying. I honestly really want to punch anyone who tells me that I’m the face. I hate being lied to. Maybe it gets better for some people, but not for everyone, you can’t just generalize all people into one category, we’re all different."
depression,fko4p4m,t3_fj15uq,1584380056.0,"Oh absolutely. I’m always feeling like that. I know there are people in my family that care about me. But outside of that I think legitimately nobody cares about me, and I’m getting proved right more and more every day. People seem to want nothing to do with me. It’s like I’m naturally hated or something. Like, quit being mad at me, I didn’t chose to be born."
depression,fko4gi8,t3_fjjfxl,1584379923.0,"It never works for me. I used to be overweight and last year I lost all of that weight. I was 302 pounds, now I’m 178. My biggest fear is gaining weight again. I never want to go back to that. So everytime I eat, particularly if it’s over a certain amount of calories, I absolutely have a meltdown, my anxiety gets super bad and I start panicking and getting mad at myself for it."
depression,fko37hw,t3_fjhs0k,1584379241.0,"Yes, I absolutely do 100%."
depression,fko35w2,t3_fjemp2,1584379215.0,I completely agree
depression,fknlcfa,t3_fjj9q2,1584368526.0,"Same, I wish they could at least tell me what it was they didn’t like about me so I know what to do for next time."
depression,fknl7bb,t3_fje15m,1584368442.0,"I feel the same. If there is a higher power out there, then they’re really in humane."
depression,fknl0le,t3_fizaln,1584368319.0,"OMG same. I hate that, people always tell me I can talk to them or they’ll be my friend or something. But then I found out they’re lying, usually after a day they’ll ignore me and quit responding to my messages or texts, sometimes it will show that they’ve read them, but don’t respond. After I annoy them enough, they’ll respond to me with some obvious pathetic lie such as “I was at work” or “I was busy”. Or sometimes I’ve had that do respond to me, but only if I talk to them first, they’re never the ones to start a conversation, which shows that I obviously don’t matter to them. One person even told me one time “oh sorry I forgot to talk to you” I pretty much wanted to do nothing more than punch him in the face after that."
depression,fknkfu6,t3_fjhh3i,1584367925.0,Me too. I wouldn’t have to build up strength to kill myself or anything and everyone would call me brave when I die rather than a selfish coward.
depression,fkhif4q,t3_fijs7h,1584199570.0,I’m convinced that it’s not for everyone.
depression,fkhhmbs,t3_fi4ncx,1584199028.0,"I agree with you completely. The same thing happens to me. I make posts and they go unnoticed, I’ve never had more than 10 likes on a post, and maybe like a few comments.
I guess my issues don’t matter. I’ve came here and posted hoping I’d get support but it never happens. I really need support, just a few people seeing my post and maybe getting a few comments isn’t gonna work. It reinforces my belief that my issues don’t matter to anyone."
depression,fkegz9v,t1_fkdu3ht,1584112985.0,"That’s ok, you want private chat? It’s a lot of things"
depression,fkdlaf8,t1_fkdl9l0,1584083352.0,I play on PS4
depression,fkdks64,t1_fkdkqw0,1584082724.0,Well it’s 3 am and I can’t sleep. Not great
depression,fkdezgi,t1_fkddiuv,1584076446.0,Wanna talk? Sounds like we could both use someone.
depression,fkd99og,t1_fkd3f4q,1584071708.0,Can we private chat?
depression,fkd2u2n,t3_exo6f1,1584067002.0,My posts here seem to get ignored. But I’m really not feeling well. I really could use someone to talk to right now.
depression,fkd2j1c,t3_fhrd6n,1584066788.0,I’m about to do the same
depression,fkd1l9x,t3_fhrpbs,1584066155.0,I was diagnosed with that as well
depression,fkd11yi,t1_fkd0zfh,1584065795.0,I’m fine. I just really need someone right now to with. I don’t have anyone right now.
depression,fkd0v4u,t1_fkbv0mt,1584065668.0,This is the first time this happened though
depression,fkbxt9g,t1_fkbv0mt,1584041939.0,I can imagine
depression,fkbmrt9,t1_fkbmqk8,1584035894.0,Ok
depression,fkbmn9m,t3_fhjum2,1584035826.0,Same
depression,fkbmhwd,t3_fhjq2j,1584035745.0,Want to chat?
depression,fkbm3hy,t3_fhjwp2,1584035529.0,I’m here. Want to chat?
depression,fkbl5ri,t3_fhjnpe,1584035023.0,"I comment on lots of posts here as well. I can relate you in a few ways. I’ve never had a single friend before or a girlfriend. I’m having some family issues as well (which I already did a whole post on). Like I said I’ve never had a single friend, I’ve had people online come and go but that’s it. The only people that care about me is family, my mom, my brother, my grandparents, my aunt. It’s coming to the point where the only people I care about is my family as well. I don’t know you, but I’d be more than willing to be your friend. Even if I don’t know you, you still matter to me. If you support and care about me then I support and care about you too."
depression,fkbjwv7,t1_fkbhngx,1584034363.0,Thank you!
depression,fkbjsob,t1_fkbhmgl,1584034308.0,I really don’t know either.
depression,fkbgo0u,t3_fhglw4,1584032655.0,"I feel the exact same way honestly. I’ve never had a friend before or relationship, I’m dealing with some family issues (which I’ve already made a whole post about on here), I’m becoming too lonely. I just got a job, but I’m probably gonna lose it soon because I have trouble keeping jobs. I have a disability which makes it hard to communicate. It’s really not easy."
depression,fkbg7hl,t3_fhj3ve,1584032411.0,"I’ve been feeling accomplished lately too. I finally got my drivers license a few weeks ago (I’m 22 mind you), I’ve also just got a job, I start today, I just hope I don’t mess it up like I keep doing my last ones."
depression,fkbfzmy,t3_fhdb72,1584032301.0,"Honestly me too. I really don’t want to live, but I’m afraid to die. I think a big reason is I don’t know what happens when you die. I also feel like there’s still a little bit of hope left that things will get better eventually."
depression,fkbfjms,t3_fhfoi7,1584032079.0,Same honestly. It’s like people forget that I have feelings too.
depression,fkbfhlo,t3_fhgym2,1584032051.0,"I totally get you, that’s happened to me before."
depression,fkbfdkz,t3_exo6f1,1584031993.0,Really not feeling well. Honestly at this point I’m convinced that I was just meant to be unhappy. I feel as if in a past life I was a terrible person and this life is punishment for that.
depression,fkbez26,t3_fhj1u9,1584031783.0,You described how I feel perfectly. I also really wish I was someone else.
depression,fkbddae,t3_fh565g,1584030911.0,I’m pretty much doing that too. I just can’t fake it anymore. Joker pretty much nailed it when they said the worse part about having a mental illness is your supposed to act like you don’t. I can’t lie anymore.
cyberpunkgame,fkbd3e7,t3_fhhr3v,1584030763.0,I hope they don’t delay it anymore
depression,fkbbi2z,t1_fkbao1j,1584029893.0,"It definitely is a lot. As I said I’m already dealing with other problems that are causing my depression, I could go on for a while about those ones, this just makes it even worse. Yes me and my mom have always been close, she loves me and my brother more than anything and she will no matter what, we’re everything to her. It has to be a mid life crisis. I’m trying to find a therapist, the last one wasn’t that great but I’m still looking. I’m afraid to take anti depressants again, all of them have made me gain weight, I was over weight from 2016 to last year when I stopped taking them and lost all the weight. I’m on mood stabilisers and anxiety medications though, which do help a little bit."
depression,fkayfhu,t1_fkayac5,1584022312.0,Yeah. These therapy places I’m looking at don’t do medications.
depression,fkawbsh,t1_fkavjsv,1584020962.0,"I’m trying to find a therapist, I had one a while ago but they weren’t that good, it was through the same people prescribing me my meds, but I am trying to find one. I’ll see if I can get a referral though."

Advice,fka4wn5,t1_fka4fvx,1583992630.0,"I think it’s one of those mid life crisis things, she wants to be young again and he makes her feel young. That’s what I’m trying to do. I love my mom, I’m kind of afraid to move out because I’m afraid something will happen when I’m gone."
depression,fk9zb3k,t1_fk9z146,1583987465.0,"She has told me she’s never gonna die alone and told me that’s a big fear of hers, so you may be right about that. I also think it could be one of those mid life crisis things, where she’s with him because she wants to be young again and he makes her feel younger."
