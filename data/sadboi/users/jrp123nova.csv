The idea of it seems kinda strange to me - like we‚Äôre not out there as patients picking and choosing our meds on the basis of a strong advertising campaign?? That‚Äôs the job for our doctors who write prescriptions based on best medical evidence, not adverts. I dunno, different culture I guess. The only medicine adverts we have are for prescription-free stuff such as you might pick up in a supermarket, e.g. cough & cold syrups etc."

I‚Äôm nowhere as fit as I was when I had it before, but I‚Äôm just going really easy when I go there and not expecting too much of myself. Like, even if it‚Äôs just 8 measly minutes walking on the treadmill and then I go home - who cares? The point is I made it down there even though my depression is really bad right now. But I‚Äôm starting to feel my fitness creeping back and that will lead me in itself to stay longer each time, so I‚Äôm trusting that gradually I‚Äôll get back to my original fitness level and it will become less of a chore.

bipolar,fk739o2,t1_fk6w045,1583926358.0,"Certainly the lows of BP2 reach as deep as those of BP1 - it‚Äôs the mania that BP1 has extreme. It‚Äôs a common misconception that BP1 is more severe than 2 though, when in actual fact they are just as bad each other. Just different manifestations of the same illness! 

At least, that‚Äôs my understanding anyway. You guys are totally right about the no monopoly on pain thing. The best thing we can do is be kind and support each other and not try to compare :)

Edit: I was thinking along the lines of the clinical criteria for BP1 & BP2, that clinicians don‚Äôt make a severity distinction between the two. In terms of our own personal sufferings, that‚Äôs a different matter, everyone‚Äôs individual on that front."

bipolar,fk07xzu,t3_ffrjjf,1583746205.0,"I‚Äôve had what I believe are DP/DR episodes, which I‚Äôm pretty sure are related to an early adulthood trauma I went through (the same trauma that my psyc points to as a major factor in exacerbating my bipolar illness). I think maybe the DP/DR are like a kind of PTSD response? But I don‚Äôt know yet because I‚Äôm yet to talk properly to my therapist about it all, these aren‚Äôt symptoms that I‚Äôve fully recounted to my psychiatrist because it‚Äôs all been so difficult to talk about. But it‚Äôs on the table for my next therapy session. I don‚Äôt know if DP/DR is something that comes about just from having bipolar but it would make total sense, given how difficult and traumatic just having the illness in itself can be."

It‚Äôs wonderful and provides world class care when it works, but sadly the mental health provision is criminally underfunded and stretched to breaking point. This is even with politicians continually promising to give mental health extra funds and parity of esteem with physical. Among the worst of it is the waiting lists - I waited 18 months to see a psychiatrist one time.

If nothing else, you‚Äôre in a place where you are seeking help, and that in itself is an achievement. It takes a while to find the right meds so keep talking to your doctor about how your current ones make you feel and hopefully they can figure out something that might work better for you.
