pediatrics,fjyf5op,t1_fjyb8yj,1583695417.0,One can read so many different articles on the internet that scare you beyond doubt and get you to second guess every decision you've ever made. The baby was admitted to the hospital and by the grace of God is on the route to recovery. Off all the things I've read on the net this is the best advice. Thank you.

AskReddit,fgoap9a,t3_ezewgo,1580964087.0,"I was seven years old when I was furious with my mom,  though I don't remember why. In a fit of rage I locked myself in the room and sat on the bed crying.  After a a while I heard my mom knock the door like crazy, like she literally was trying to break it open. Me being the sadist I was didn't open it because I had to teach my mom a lesson, I ignored the loud thumps and pretended to be asleep this continued for a while till my mother who was now shouting at the top of her voice ( I couldn't understand what she was yelling) then she gave up, or atleast that's what I thought. A few moments later my   mother risks her life and jumps from the adjacent balcony ( we live in an apartment so the height is life threatening) to  the one connecting the room I was in.  Turns out my mom did this all in an attempt to save my 9 month old baby sister who would have fell off the cane swing she was sleeping in. She made it in time because all the banging had waken her up and she could have rolled out of the swing to her death( the swing was high you see ) any moment. What happened to me after that??? The whole apartment got to know what I did and everyone told me how bad I was to do something like that, but what hurt me the most was my mom was silent,  she did look at me with the death stare but not a word. That made it so much worse,I felt guilty like hell."

pregnant,f8azmqu,t3_dy4db3,1574420590.0,"I recently found out I'm pregnant(7+ weeks), Now I have to decide on which hospital I go to for my check ups. There is one  which is a less popular one, where my sister in law had her delivery,(a normal delivery) which she  recommends I go to as it's just 4 kilometres away from my home. Then there is another hospital which is popular among my cousins (they had normal delivery too) but is  9 kilometres away from my home. I  am unable to decide where to go.  Even if i did go to both the hospitals before I finalize, how do I know which one has a good gynaecologist. Like what questions does one ask and how do you judge a doctor before you finalize."
