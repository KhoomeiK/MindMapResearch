Keep fighting though.. I believe in you! That frustration will slowly seems less important as you learn to accept that it’s ok to feel how you feel.

If it will help you feel happier and more in control of any negative thoughts or tendencies .. then it’s the right choice. 


I Hope you find some help my friend. Do you have any close family or friends that you can talk with or just be around?"
Anxiety,fh26efh,t3_f15u1b,1581237356.0,I get a version of this too.. usually in my hand and arm. (Complete numbness) I’m not sure why or what causes it but it’s terrifying at times.
Anxiety,fh26ain,t3_f15u3q,1581237206.0,"I hear you .. and you’re not alone 

I’m so overwhelming sorry to hear about your struggle. 

Have you explored a group therapy session? There are free drop in mental health group sessions in almost every city. 

If you’d like I could help you get the contact information for one of them. 

It can seem like we face life all by ourselves some times, but I’m telling ya! We’re all cheering for you!!"
Anxiety,fh25t44,t1_fh257u0,1581236553.0,"Giving our problems a voice is 100% scary. And I’m sure your not wrong about what’s to come. But I promise you it’s how we get better. We talk and we listen and we cry and we heal. And if we can’t heal at least we know what we’re dealing with. 

I can’t speak to what people do and don’t deserve. All I know for certainly is that we are all entitled to some happiness and love. 

Being fearful of failing or not recognizing our value compared to the people close to us .. comes from a place of love (it really does) . And if you love your family so much that your afraid of letting them down or they would be better off without you.. I CAN tell you one thing.. they are lucky to have you.

Lucky to have someone that loves them so much. That worries about their well being above even their own.. 

That’s a rare gift in this world.  

I see you and I admire that sacrifice. 

Keep at the therapy, remind yourself every day that your gonna make it.  

You got at least 1 cheerleader over here!!"

Anxiety,fh24x7l,t1_fh24kmm,1581235372.0,"Yea ... I get the “hurts a lot” part ..  have you been to therapy? Does it help? 

I sometime ask myself .. why does this hurt so much? What is the specific feeling  that I’m struggling with? 
And why does that feeling have so much power over me? And why is it so important? 

What would be 1 thing you can do right now that might help? Be specific. And be reasonable with your request of yourself. (Hint.. pick something easy)

It feels good to get a win once and awhile :)"

Anxiety,fh1yx1v,t3_f14ahz,1581228617.0,"I feel for you. I really do. I’m sorry that you feel the scales of friendship are tilted away from you. 

I have a good piece of advice that I’ll share with you .. it’s helped me time and time again. 

Give your love and your friendship with no expectation of return. If we are expecting a trade of our love and friendship for something similar in return then we are in a transactional relationship. It will hurt us if the value of the returning love and friendship does not meet or exceed the value of what was offered. 

And if you we do require some reciprocity, it’s our job to vocalize that. And make sure everyone involved in the transaction understands the terms. 

You seem like a genuinely kind soul. I hope you find some peace in the world. 

Go start today. Give your friend a hug and tell them how much you value their presence in your life, ask if there is anything you can do to help them, and remind them of a time they helped you. 

Good luck :)"
