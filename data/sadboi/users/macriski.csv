BPD,fp02c6p,t1_fozi9vt,1588201168.0,I think that has to do with like the identity problems/disassociation that comes with bpd. You’re so unsure of yourself and who you are that you can’t trust yourself and then you simultaneously feel so removed from not only yourself but your emotions that you can’t believe/process they’re happening so it all feels like a lie.
BPD,fkru2m1,t3_fk7n81,1584476044.0,One of the hardest parts of BPD is being unsure of not only yourself but your loved ones intentions. Something I started doing was make a list of things I know to be true about that person. I make a list of good and bad things. Moments or traits that are positive with them and also ones that are negative. I think for me seeing it all laid out as both good and bad helps readjust my thinking. In the past when it gets really bad I sit by myself for a while and try and draw or do some idle activity until things calm down a little bit and then proceed with the list making. I’m so sorry you have to deal with this you’re so brave!
