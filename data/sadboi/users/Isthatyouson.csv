The takedown challenges don’t count as actual takedowns so don’t worry about them. Most of the challenges are pretty much just using the shield, and it was fairly okay just levelling it up and doing all the challenges, EXCEPT THE 3 KILLSTREAKS.

Again, play with a friend so they can try distract for you. Play gamemodes with objectives (hardpoint/headquarters is probs your best bet as you spawn close to objectives). Just play like the biggest pussy ever, gotta be so patient cus the moment you sprint at someone you will die. Wait in corners/dark areas, don’t put any camo on the shield. Knife as secondary so you can move around/run up on someone. Ghost, double time (changed to cold blooded if a vtol was up), tracker, dead silence.
