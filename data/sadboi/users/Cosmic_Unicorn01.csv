depression,f7b3xvl,t3_dv37ic,1573554461.0,"Yep, I was feeling pretty out of it recently but this week has come and shaken things right up - innumerable different stresses now piling up and I've started to feel a bit dissociative every day. It's like I'm only half here and I don't know where the other half is...

I really hope it gets better but life seems really overwhelming right now and all I want to do is go to sleep for a few months."
depression,f74sttf,t3_duabfe,1573407511.0,"Hi OP,  I know I'm probably echoing all the things everyone else has said so far but please don't do it. I have been on both sides of this, and there really is nothing worse than wanting to die and simultaneously nothing worse than someone else dying. Recently I decided to try sketching to pass the time when I'm alone and not feeling good mentally - it's amazing how my mood and mind completely changed after an hour of concentrating on nothing but drawing a photo in front of me. I'm not even good at drawing, but the challenge and the satisfaction I got from creating something somehow snapped me out of the mood I had been in for weeks. I'm not saying you need to draw, but an outlet is definitely going to help you. Otherwise there are hotlines you can call - not sure what country you're in - where you can speak to another human for as long as you need to. Sorry if you've already heard that before, but just speaking to someone out loud where you can really feel the weight and emotion of your own words can really give a release too.
I really hope you choose to keep on living, i swear that you will look back on this dark period of your life in the future and will be glad you're still here to do that."

So I've been high pretty much every day for the last few months, and I've run out today and don't want to buy more in case it's making things worse but I really am finding it hard to cope already."
depression,f61171f,t3_dpl4bu,1572630706.0,"Oh wow, I was literally googling high functioning depression treatments yesterday - I'm glad I've found this thread because I've never seen what I feel like written down so accurately.

The last couple of months in particular (though it's lasted for much longer than) I've been desperate to get home from work or any social activities I enjoy (where I socialise, am outgoing, laugh, chat etc) so I can make dinner and get high and watch TV/play video games alone. Because being sober and doing those things isn't enough anymore, I need to be high to take the edge off and truly keep me distracted. I go to the gym, dance, work, I have multiple friend groups and I try to keep busy... But there's always that pull inside me telling me I need to get away.

I fixate on things that are wrong with me constantly - like physically and mentally and my personality. When I'm out and about I feel confident, chatty and smiley, but when I get home and I don't feel like I'm adequately distracted and I feel so frustrated I could scream. And instead I just cry and cry and want to pull my own hair out. 

Sometimes when I'm alone (I have a flatmate who I don't see much, but her presence in the flat makes me really uncomfortable because I just want to be alone) I feel like I'm not alone enough... Like just knowing I'm in the same building as other people makes me want to go and drive away into the middle of nowhere and just stay there or move somewhere else completely and start fresh. Even people I like messaging me can be too much because I feel like life is already overwhelming without friends wanting to talk to me when I'm finally alone - but I'll still see them and eventually get back to them. 

I go to a counsellor every three weeks to just talk through things that are going on, and she does always make me feel a bit better... But she's also constantly asking if maybe I'm a bit lonely, and telling me that my goal should be to get in touch with my true self and then everything will fall into place. But I have no idea who my true self is. Like if I've managed to live to my late twenties and not understand who I am, how am I supposed to start now?! And I don't feel lonely because I genuinely want to be alone... I just don't know what to do with myself when I am alone unless I'm high or really into TV or a game. 

Is this high functioning depression or some sort of weed addiction or both? Or something completely different? I'm getting to the point where I'm considering going back on citalopram because at least then I felt like I didn't care about anything.

Also sorry for the ramble, I've not talked about this properly really so I'm sort of letting it all out haha."
