reconnected on FB with a somewhat-friend from high school a few years after graduation. made plans for dinner and drinks. he asked me to pick him up bc his car was 'in the shop' (spoiler alert: he had no car). he never made eye contact, and stayed on his prepaid flip phone the entire time. 
 
he had me drive him to a random parking lot across town. i ask him 'where are we going to eat? is there something we're waiting for?' and got no real answer. after an hour of idling in my car, i tell him i'm hungry and am taking us to get some food like we had planned. he says 'okay, but we have to go to this restaurant closer to my house' suuuure thing buddy. 
 
so we get back over there, he ends up sending me inside to get to-go food. while i'm in there, he makes a drug deal in the parking lot from my car! i get back in and immediately confront him for using me as free transportation and a meal ticket. 
 
at this point, we were both mad, so i drive him back to 'his place' only to see his mother standing in the doorway in her robe and slippers! he gets out of my car, grabbed the food i paid for and waited over 2 hours to get. i lost my shit, and holler out 'hey ma, check your boy's fucking pockets!' and drove off. 
 
in his hurry to leave my vehicle now that i had served my purpose, he left his burner phone on the floorboard. smashing that thing on the side of the highway almost made the whole ordeal worth it. 
 
and no, we never spoke again."

the months leading up to my 27th birthday, i was more paranoid and reclused than an agoraphobic methhead. i was a nervous wreck the entire year, my mind's eye seeing death and disaster everywhere i went. 
  
and then i turned 28. then i realized i'm a fucking moron who wasted the last year being scared of something that is truly inevitable and uncontrollable. i'll be 29 in two months, fate willing. 
  
moral of the story is: no reason to waste time worrying about it, when you never know which moment will actually be your last. it's easier said than done, but try to enjoy them all while you still know you can. accept your fate as a self-aware pile of decaying cells."
