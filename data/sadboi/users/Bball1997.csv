wiggles,fr3nibs,t3_ge43bm,1589861409.0,"They really got on an Irish kick starting with ""Wiggle Town"" when they first redid ""Di Dicki Do Dum"" and then it seemed like the songs just kept coming from there as they redid ""Michael Finnegan"" and ""I'll Tell Me Ma"" and also kept making new songs featuring Irish dancing.  Obviously it's gotten bigger since then and is still a huge thing today.  I feel like a lot of what started it was Anthony having such a large hand in the music production and the new Wiggles more than likely being willing to go along with his requests.

""Wiggle Wiggle Wiggle"" is probably my favorite series from the new generation thus far.  The songs they re-recorded at that time sounded amazing and the new songs were pretty good too.  I was shocked when the 2017 version of ""Wiggly Wiggly Christmas"" came after it and was a complete 180 musically.  There was just so much music in the show and they got all the Wiggles in on multiple different instruments... I want to say each of them played guitar and drums at least once in the 26 episode run and the tunes were just plain amazing again.  If an album came out with some of these songs I would most likely save it or buy it.  Good stuff!"

wiggles,fqmdp55,t1_fqmca2w,1589475740.0,"I agree with that.  Actually I'm surprised Anthony has stuck around this long.  I was expecting him to leave in maybe 2016 at the latest but here we are a few years later and he's still rockin.

Honestly though I wouldn't be surprised if Simon left within the next few years.  First they changed him from yellow to red but at least kept him as the lead singer for the most part, but now 8 years in with Emma and Lachy getting all the attention he just seems out of place.  It's a shame because his voice is amazing but now he just kinda sits around and plays whatever instrument they deem fit to have him play.  Concerts have been a different story but the videos and albums feature him in scarce capacity nowadays."

wiggles,fm34u1p,t1_fm2h98t,1585712902.0,"I think a good song to look at for this comparison is ""We're Dancing With Wags the Dog"".  This song is one of a few to have been sang by Greg, Sam, Lachy, and Simon.  Of course Greg had the original and therefore the favorite, Sam always sounded like he was struggling to match the notes of this song to me, Lachy got a little closer but not quite there, and while Simon doesn't quite match Greg or Sam on this song in particular, you can tell he's there and committed the whole time from start to finish.  

I agree on the albums before 2013.  Up to ""Racing to the Rainbow"" you can hear both Simon and Sam on a lot of songs with ease.  ""Follow the Bird"" is pretty much their backing vocals throughout and Greg and the others kinda get drowned out in the background.  These days the backing vocalists are Emma, Lachy, Simon, and Paddy, plus I think Jackie Barnes helped them out for a few albums while he was doing drums for them.  It always sounds so hollow if they even do use backing vocals, though there are harmonies there.

I guess I see Simon as more similar to Sam than Greg but I totally get the angle you're going for there.  I just think it's weird how they spent so much time trying to get the fans used to Simon only to do a total 180 4 years in.  To further solidify my opinion on how I think each Wiggle sounds, I would expect to hear Simon on vocals for an updated version of ""Wave to Wags"" or ""Play Your Guitar With Anthony"" whereas I would expect Lachy to take on something like ""Swim With Me"" from Wiggly Safari or ""Six Months In A Leaky Boat"". Finally, Emma would fit well on a song like ""Little Children"" or ""Let's Make Some Rosy Tea""... we'll probably never see those six songs re-recorded, but my hopes were low for ""Here Come the Wiggles"" and I was surprised so we'll see."
wiggles,fm2e4iy,t1_flyh2n5,1585695662.0,"I like that they acknowledge the Sam era also, but a lot of the songs from his era are protected with the copyrights Sam received upon his dismissal.  That's why Getting Strong, Follow the Leader, and a few others from his era are still preformed on a regular basis, they were either written by or with Greg before he left in 2006 or existed beforehand.  When I'm Painting also seems to have fallen outside of these rights as I want to say it was written by Greedy Smith from Mental As Anything.  Dr. Knickerbocker to my knowledge was not originally a Wiggles song either which is why it's still preformed today.  I just thought it was really lazy that everything was the same as the 2016 version except for Lachy's voice and the sound effect for the hips.

Nicky Nacky Nocky Noo was alright in some aspects... I thought the harmony was really good and that the banjo was a nice touch also... it's just a bummer that they keep altering all these songs.  Wiggly Wiggly Christmas had words omitted, Christmas Picnic got edited to take place indoors, Dressing Up had a whole section removed just to accommodate Emma's ballet, I could go on. 

Dorothy has been kinda creepy ever since Maria Field took over three years ago.  The voice has gotten lighter over the years too.  My personal favorites were the lady who was doing it at the start of the Sam era (I think that's Claire Field), and Blathanid Conroy-Murphy who voiced her from like 2011-2013 or something like that.  I understand she's supposed to be five and all, but having Maria Field voice her is just weird... it would be like if Antonio Field (Anthony's son) started doing Henry the Octopus, even though Paul Paddick absolutely assaults that voice (shudders). 

Finally on Simon, I think with how often we've been seeing The Monkey Dance on concert rosters this past year, there's a fair chance we're going to see that sooner or later with a rearranged instrumental.  Here's hoping that stays Simon only and doesn't go to Lachy or get split up when it does materialize.  Simon's voice just fits so many songs it's uncanny.  His tone registers so low but he still keeps the energy, whereas Emma's voice seems to struggle and Lachy just sounds like so wooden a lot of the time."

wiggles,fkmq3mb,t1_fkltpzt,1584336039.0,"They definitely have changed.  When the new gen first came in they were still typical Wiggles minus the fact that the red one was the main lead vocalist now and the changes resulting from that.  Time went on and Emma and Lachy both got popular enough to have their own spin offs and appearances without Anthony and Simon and so they capitalized on that and brought them to the front.  Around this time Anthony decided banjo and bagpipes were cool and now they're in a lot of songs.  Some songs sound alright with them but others certainly do not.  They definitely do opera but not as much lately.  If anything, the band is all about Emma and Lachy right now and Anto and Simon are along for the ride, though Simon still gets painted as the lead singer on a lot of merch.... 

You can also tell they are running out of ideas for songs.  The vast majority of the tracklist for upcoming album Fun & Games is either songs that already exist or songs that were previously done by one of the band's three iterations (Greg/Sam/New Gen)... my hopes were high for this album when Here Comes the Wiggles came out a few weeks back, but Baby Shark is making me hold the phone.  Can You Point and Here Comes A Bear are both on here as is Nicky Nacky Nocky Noo and I'm hoping they don't destroy them.  I don't mind a new arrangement of music but there have been multiple occasions where the new gen has destroyed a song by removing drums or changing the tempo.  Fingers crossed here."

I think that Donna is going to end up being related to someone from the recent episodes but I don't think it would be Charles or Chic... I'm still waiting to see them have their big bad moment, and I think they're the ones filming the doorsteps... no way that's the Stonewall kids, Evelyn, or Mr. Honey.

wiggles,firahcg,t1_fir6v8w,1582660603.0,"I think a lot of that comes from the other three effectively doing life together for a few years there before Lachy and Emma separated and even after a little bit, whereas Simon has gone off and done his own thing.  While Emma and Lachy helped out with most of the recent reunion shows, Simon has only been there for two and at one of them he was in the spotlight quite a bit.  He's not even as present on the albums anymore vocally.  Big Ballet Day and Party Time had a ton of Emma and Lachy and not a lot of Simon.  That all being said, it's nice to see him getting the lead quite a bit here at least, but who knows if that will carry over to the album"
wiggles,fiql2c2,t1_fiq1k8h,1582646593.0,"The originals hold a special place in my heart also.  To me, it's simply amazing that the new gen has covered so many of the original material.  Looking at the track list for Fun & Games there's even a Sam era song or two on there as well now.  Either this album will be a way to introduce the current Wiggles fans to the classic tunes, or it'll be another poorly run attempt with tempos changed, verses and words added/omitted, and more Emma singing lead on songs she shouldn't be.  I'm leaning towards the second right now after how Party Time turned out, but we will see.

I'm just glad they even thought to cover this song in the first place.  It's on a short list of mine including Wave to Wags, the full version of Quack Quack, and Do the Wiggle Groove just to name a few."

riverdale,fhb8hhr,t3_f1v0ve,1581437034.0,"I can agree with this on an honest level.  Season 2 was terrible for me, and while Season 3 had multiple issues with it's writing and plot as well as it's character development, it still feels like a more cohesive story line than this season so far.  From what I'm seeing so far, either Brett/Donna or Charles/Chic are supposed to be the main villains this season, but we haven't seen Chic in a little while so I'm shaky on the second pair.  Meanwhile we had Archie with Dodger and once he left we switched to Frank who has been an irritating character to say the least.  

The filler has been terrible too.  Kevin doing tickle porn, Veronica fighting with her father, even Toni exacting revenge on Nick St. Clair, all terrible, generally because there's little to no background in the story.  When they began the ""Hiram is sick"" plotline at the end of last week's episode, I rolled my eyes because we all know that Hiram isn't going to die.  The same thing could be said about Jughead's ""murder"".  They keep making it look like it's real through all the poorly began ""flash-forwards"", but we know there's no way it's real.

Even the big Farm finale from 4x03 felt forced and as if it could have been handled at the end of Season 3 instead, not tying up an extra episode of the next season.  Nobody from the Farm appeared in 4x01-2, so why they set that up like that I have no clue.  Rocketman Edgar was pretty laugh out loud funny though.

I also feel that Lord Huron is a group that has increased my love/curiosity of strange wooded places and even wanderlust in general.  I really wish they would put out an orchestral album with some of their music.  Imagine the first musical break in Lullaby with a strong brass section and some timpani hits, or Frozen Pines with woodwinds and strings.

walmart,ffe80rh,t1_ff6bd1n,1579839200.0,"I think the PL should have a rotating schedule with 1 5-2, 1 1-10 or 2-11, and the rest of the week like 10-7.  Screw the cozy 7-4 bullshit.  If they work 10-7 the majority of the week they can catch the largest number of associates with HR questions, but are also available to help overnights at least one day if not two, and they can also catch all the minors with school questions."
walmart,ffe51bu,t1_ffdi9y6,1579836880.0,"This.  I left a toxic store with not too many long-term employees outside of the DM crew to come to a store where more than half the associates were long-term and there was an Academy where most of the associates had at least five years under their belt, myself included.  Overtime was handed out willy nilly at the old store, but at this one you couldn't get jack squat for overtime because the payroll was skyhigh with the long-term associates.  My old store is currently experiencing it's longest-tenured set of ASMs in years after during the three years I was there it seemed like we lost one or two every single month no joke."

thomasthetankengine,ff02wro,t3_eqlskl,1579464606.0,"* Duncan appearing in BMM and Season 17 (they should have his render completed)
* Sodor locations that didn't exist during the first few books of the RWS not being present in The Adventure Begins, the 7-berth Tidmouth Sheds being the best example. 
* I would continue to have the characters introduced between Series 8-12 appear with speaking roles in the CGI Series.  So many of them appeared once and never again, or once or twice with a few non-speaking cameos.  We wasted so much of Seasons 8-16 with not so quality episodes about Thomas and the Steam Team that we forgot almost the rest of the Island.  Now when Duck or Donald & Douglas show up they're completely new characters that need re-introducing. 
* Paxton Norman & Sidney all should have had speaking roles in Day of the Diesels.  In addition, they should have structured Diesel 10 to actually seem more menacing similar to how they painted him at the end of Misty Island Rescue. 
* Have The Great Race be Gordon's special, not Thomas'.  So much good could have been done giving Gordon the spotlight for a change.  The special may have tanked among kids but us adults and older fandom members would have enjoyed the hell out of it."
Christianity,ff01cyb,t3_eqx0l1,1579464095.0,"I don't 100% believe it's a necessity, however there is a verse in the Scriptures that tells us not to forsake the gathering of the believers.  I wouldn't feel guilty about it regardless.  I use to beat myself up when I missed a Sunday or two here and there, and almost every Sunday morning I wake up and struggle with whether or not I should go.  Days like today it's even harder because morning services were cancelled and now they're meeting this evening due to the weather.  I will probably go, but I don't feel it's a ""do or die"" portion of our faith in the end."
wiggles,fezzgo5,t1_fet52ls,1579463541.0,"Ever since the Classic albums went up on Spotify last month I've been reconnecting with the back catalouge of the original group and the 2012 material.  There's so much charm in it and heart and even a little bit of whimsy.  I feel that the new gen has put out ***mostly*** good material in terms of their music, but at the same time they seem set on hamming it up to 11 with the stuff the original group (and even Sam's era for that matter) reserved for concerts.  There's just something to be said about the original albums without every second of music filled with something vocal ya know?

Sam had a fantastic singing voice, but I feel he failed to capture the magic of the original songs.  One thing I like about the new gen is how much classic material they've covered, almost too much honestly but still good for the most part.  Sam felt like a different era entirely with Jeff Murray and Anthony dragged along for the ride against their will, or maybe that's just me."
wiggles,fezye86,t1_few2m0d,1579463235.0,"A lot of the songs that Emma sang lead on for the Party Time album sounded so hollow and off.  The same could be said about Emma 2!  She does alright on songs like Romp Bomp A Stomp and I Am A Fine Musician, but listen to Pin the Bow on Emma and I guarantee you'll cringe the whole way through.

I'm not really settled on Lachy right now.  Part of me is ticked that they took the main lead vocalist spot away from Simon and thinks that Lachy's voice doesn't fit on a lot of songs (Great Big Man In Red, I Love It When It Rains, etc...)  These days, Lachy sings almost everything on the albums from front to back and I feel it's caused a bit of a downhill slide in quality.  When the new gen first started the songs they were giving him at the time were pretty good (We're Dancing With Wags the Dog and Dressing Up are good examples), but over time those first few years a lot of songs that had Lachy singing lead went to Simon, and now that's happening in reverse and twice as fast it seems.  They really need to find a groove with who sings what.  They should have made Lachy yellow, Simon purple, and Emma red if this was their plan but then again ""Wake up Simon"" would take quite a bit of getting used to.   Anyways, rant over sorry."
wiggles,fesv4oi,t3_epz9nt,1579369312.0,I got my card to go through.  I had already seen most of it on YouTube but wanted to do my part to support the wildfire relief effort and as I'm a broke college student this was the best way.
wiggles,fesum5g,t1_fessptl,1579369168.0,"I love all the songs with the guest stars.  It makes it pretty special.  The new gen did the same thing with Duets but it didn't pan out as well and didn't feel as natural because of all the re-used guest star footage and some poor mixing leading to a few songs having bits and pieces of the old instrumental tracks audibly heard throughout.

That 2005 tour was so amazing.  I remember being worried they were going to preform my least favorite songs at the time (Hoop Dee Doo and Lights Camera Action) but at least one was left out and the other was t too terrible.  That was the year they were testing out Music Box Dancer as well so I was part of the audience that got to hear it before it was officially released on Racing To the Rainbow.  Jeff was in the audience that day and IIRC, he walked right below us on the next level down or we were so far into the row we didn't get a chance to meet him."
ibs,ferr8r2,t3_eq87m9,1579357428.0,"The last two days I've eaten two meals or less and all after 12pm, either not eating at all or snacking before that due to feeling plugged up when I wake up in the morning.  However, if I eat too much dairy late at night (cheese especially), I block up like a brick and have intense stomach pain at night that wakes me from sleeping and then in the morning I wake up with what feels like broken up but not yet fully formed poop sloshing around in the abdomen so I'm unable to eat until that comes out."
wiggles,ferka6l,t3_emvxr4,1579354979.0,"The Monkey Dance grew weary with me for a few years but now I enjoy it again from both gens, though it's odd the new gen threw it aside for like 5 years.  Seeing them preform it live most of last year gives me hope that they re-recorded it for an album or the new TV Series, and I'm hoping they didn't give that song to Lachy too like they have so many other songs that Simon sang during the first few years of the new gen.

I have some favorite concerts too.  Growing up I got to see them on their 2005 US tour right before or right as Greg was starting to have health struggles.  Luckily it was him that day and not Sam standing in.  I also like the 2003 Big Show concerts that were used for Live Hot Potatoes, and the Big Shows the new gen has put on since 2016, especially the last two years with all the musical friends they've brought on and the fact that pretty much everything is played live by the musicians, right down to Toot Toot.

I'll always appreciate It's A Wiggly Wiggly World, and I'm sad we didn't see more of that courtyard/town square the songs were filmed in.  The original Wiggly Wiggly Christmas is neat too for it's ramshackle thrown together set that still looks put together.  Wiggly Safari was always kinda neat too, as was Cold Spaghetti Western."
wiggles,fep6euq,t1_fep60h7,1579313172.0,"While he's no Greg and I'm sad at the circumstances behind the whole situation, I'm glad Simon is lending a hand.  It's been quite a while since he's appeared at anything outside of what he's required to be present for whereas Emma Lachy and Anthony basically do life together even after the divorce.  I also prefer his voice to Lachys and Emma's.  Don't know what it is.

Anyways, sending healing prayers to Greg and also to the rest of the group that they're alright to preform after what's been a very traumatic after show experience and tough day I'm sure."
wiggles,feouwji,t3_eq2je9,1579305949.0,"I've always been worried this would happen since he first came back in 2012.  Luckily he made it through that year and the reunion gigs in 2016 without issue.  I'm glad to hear he's ok.

I wonder what they'll do for the Sat night gig mentioned at the end of the article?  Throw Lachy or Simon in a yellow skivvy and call it good?"
