All the label means is you have high learning potential. The classes are supposed to be challenging.  If you‚Äôre having mental breakdowns due to pressure, that may be an anxiety issue that a therapist would help a lot with. I know it‚Äôs hard when you‚Äôre a minor to seek things like this, but asking a school counselor will help if your parents aren‚Äôt responsible.

If you don‚Äôt want to deal with the mental pressure, then quit. That‚Äôs a very adult choice and one it‚Äôs ok to make; adults have to choose between high pressure jobs and mental health balance all the time. Welcome to growing up :)"

This is a weird concept to me, blaming a label for bad study habits idk. If you think you need to study more than study more? Ask for help? Google study skills? Not to sound like grandma but you have waaaaaayyyy more tools at your disposal to figure this out than I did in high school 15 years ago."
Gifted,fq21f5e,t1_fq068bu,1589051971.0,"I got put in gifted classes young, second grade and I didn‚Äôt really understand what it was but I LOVED my gifted class. The once a week class was my saving grace through grade school and I would have been bored to tears and miserable in middle/high school if it weren‚Äôt for the gifted/AP classes. I agree the label is douchey, even as a kid I felt embarrassed to use it bc I didn‚Äôt want to sound like I was praising myself.

Thanks for doing what you do, I remember all my gifted teachers very fondly :) They each taught something special as a fun creative challenge. In 2-3rd grade it was brain teaser word puzzles and chess, 4-5th grade we learned sign language and about national parks. In middle school it was advanced science and history and high school it was a human developmental psychology class and local area studies class.

I think an important distinction is not only the IQ/test ability/aptitude/whatever you want to call it, for me the biggest thing was about wanting to be there and wanting to be challenged. The kids in the gifted/honors/AP classes weren‚Äôt magically more ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù necessarily but were more behaved, calm, and enjoyed learning. That makes such a huge difference. I remember when I moved from FL to GA and had to get retested I was in regular classes for a few months and it was hell. Not only because it was too easy but mostly bc the teacher spent most of her time trying to wrangle the students who didn‚Äôt care and acted out or goofed around.

smallbusiness,fprpafi,t3_gf6mrc,1588859344.0,"Hey friend. First, it‚Äôs good to be self aware and realize you‚Äôre underwater. This is a pressure cooker and it‚Äôs understandable you‚Äôre feeling it. Step one. 

Second, as someone who has managed mental health disorders while running a biz in an extremely stressful industry, you can manage this. It‚Äôs going to take work and not all my advice is going to be fun or appealing but it does work.

The obvious one is talking to a therapist; if money is tight there‚Äôs online options like Better Health that are more affordable. Can‚Äôt speak to those personally but therapy is good for long term because the effects of this won‚Äôt disappear when Covid does.

The key to helping yourself besides therapy is going to be as much consistency in your routine as possible. It will keep your health and mental health stable and more resilient to weather the challenges. 

Second, and you‚Äôre not going to like this, STOP DRINKING. I know, it sounds impossible but I swear the alcohol is such a huge contribution to mood swings. I‚Äôm not even talking about being drunk but the way it changes your brain and the after effects. Look it up for more detailed info.

Since you‚Äôre going to need a stress outlet to replace drinking, and this also isn‚Äôt something most people want, but you‚Äôre going to need to move. Some are scared by ‚Äúexercise‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt have to be a marathon or HIIT class. A simple walk or jump rope or a set of jumping jacks and pushups will kick in natural endorphins and make you feel better than whiskey ever could. Don‚Äôt think of it as getting in shape, this is purely for mental health. Don‚Äôt give yourself more expectations to fulfill.

Third, try to keep as consistent a sleep schedule as possible. This is easier said than done but it does wonders to keep you stable. The times don‚Äôt matter as much as the consistency. Make this a priority. Varying bedtimes and wake times mess up your body‚Äôs rhythm which affects mood. Even if you can only get 5 hrs a night, try to keep it the same 5 hours at least. 

Lastly, find a hobby that brings you comfort like listening to music or reading or drawing or playing with a dog or watching movies, anything and block off time to allow yourself a few minutes a day to this. If you‚Äôre thinking, bullshit I don‚Äôt have time for this, yes you do. The amount of time you lose to stress and anger will more than make up for it. It‚Äôs like maintenance on a car, the more time you spend tuning it, the less likely it will break down and cost more time and money in the long run.

Start with this and try to get your partner on board. Try to work our therapy with a psychiatrist (who can prescribe meds) if you can for long term help. Good luck, you can do this, and feel free to PM me if you want to vent or have more questions!"

So it's nice to see someone with a child who did exactly that, found a home with no kids and it's worked out. There are, believe it or not, many homes with no children and people who just aren't around kids and can fairly easily keep a reactive dog away from them.

Of course no child should be in danger for the sake of a dog, but the last-ditch effort may be placing in a childfree home. If that still fails, then it's probably best for the pup to be put down sadly as it's just too dangerous.

Google rewards those who pay for ads.

Google ads are one of those things that can be very simple and get complicated the more you dig into them. When I signed up the first time, they offered a free walkthrough with a Google Ads rep who showed me how the basics worked and helped set up a few ads. I‚Äôd highly recommend this, it‚Äôs in their interest to help you make successful ads.

It can be a treasure trove of data if you use it right, and it‚Äôs kinda fun to nerd out on different combinations of words and descriptions to see what gets more clicks. A good ad method is to test and adjust continually based on the feedback you get from your data. The way this becomes powerful is when you tie your ads to specific actions on your website. You‚Äôll want someone to help embed some simple code into your site so the ads can help show you if and where people click.

Anyway, it‚Äôs a lot to learn and it is all what you put into it. A warning; it‚Äôs easy to get screwed by SEO companies. I‚Äôve heard so much BS from expensive SEO agencies who don‚Äôt always live up to their value.

I think 99% of the answers you‚Äôd get are go with your local credit union or bank, where you can develop a personal relationship and they are far more likely to give you the time of day. Fees also lower."

I‚Äôve seen other posts this week of people asking the same thing, makes sense they‚Äôd try to reach out to the people applying for the thing they have questions for. Obviously they‚Äôre trying to do the work of getting answers somewhere and I‚Äôm sure reddit isn‚Äôt the only place they‚Äôre looking. C‚Äômon now. Let‚Äôs be civil."
smallbusiness,fp0xtj0,t1_fp0kkga,1588219371.0,I‚Äôve also been wondering what the Fun is toking or slamming. The anti Trump and Biden manifesto from a couple nights ago was inspired.
smallbusiness,fp0xktt,t1_fp0k9j9,1588219209.0,"I think they meant PPP. ‚ÄúFunOnion‚Äù has been posting long rants most nights, pretty entertaining although I can‚Äôt tell if they are drunk or need to be. Probably should definitely take an edible and chill. Glad to hear they got their money at least. Govt ain‚Äôt so bad if you got $72k, imagine if we actually funded it properly üòè"

iamatotalpieceofshit,fp0v3zf,t1_fp0rlvw,1588217603.0,Oh hell no. Was there really no way to fight this? Couldn‚Äôt a neighborhood petition have happened? Put the person who verbally told you yes on blast? Drag them into it? Have a lawyer friend write stern letters? Make a report to prove that a fence devaluing property is not reality?

Atlanta,fox1us0,t1_fowvnbs,1588132090.0,That‚Äôs something we can all agree on. FUCK BILLIONAIRES. Those assholes like Jeff Bezos could be saving entire states worth of unemployed families supplying basics and still be rich as Midas. Meanwhile their workers barely have time to take a potty break and aren‚Äôt supplied PPE.
Atlanta,fox1amp,t1_fowfv73,1588131707.0,"Man, I was hard disagreeing with your other posts but this just makes me feel worried on your behalf and your coworkers. It‚Äôs not fair that the choice has to be between lose your house or go back to work in a coronavirus breeding ground. I wish we had more safety nets to let folks stay safe AND pay their bills.

When you do go back to work. Please don‚Äôt let those libertarian tendencies keep you from wearing a mask if you can! Take extra precautions since y‚Äôall work close to one another. Places like factories and packing plants have been hotbeds of Covid so be ready. Stay safe."

Cringetopia,fow9wyb,t1_fow783e,1588115734.0,I got my answer. Just saw in the second post I go check out an argument defending the proud boys as totally not white nationals üòê The person saying they were got downvoted 50+ times. Soooo

Cringetopia,fow8ers,t1_fouopwn,1588114922.0,‚ÄúAs a joke‚Äù is the most retarded thing I‚Äôve heard today and this thread is full of it. Proud boys are white nationalists and ‚Äúlol I act racist as a joke‚Äù is just called being a racist asshole who doesn‚Äôt understand how to make jokes.
Cringetopia,fow7n90,t1_foua686,1588114519.0,"What the fuck are you talking about? 4chan is a bunch of racist incel edgelord nerds who respond violently to anyone who doesn‚Äôt get how cool and meta they are being because satire. Some of the very worst of the internet has started there. It is a cesspool. 

I can also see someone defending Proud Boys in the thread below, claiming they‚Äôre not white nationalists (they are) so that‚Äôs fun!

Wow 10 mins browsing this sub and I‚Äôve seen someone get downvoted for speaking out against loli hentai, which I just learned is a thing (vomit), saw two posts that were homophobic ‚Äújokes‚Äù and now someone correctly pointing out the Proud Boys are white nationalists and being downvoted EIGHTY FUCKING TIMES.

I guess it‚Äôs cool I‚Äôve managed to avoid subs this toxic for this long. Jfc I‚Äôm clearly too square and not incel teenaged boy enough to fit in here."
