The government banned all trade unions in 1927, and arrested 150 labor organizers between 1927 and 1932.

Physical force was used against some kinds of prisoners ‚Äî common criminals, suspected spies, and those accused of plotting regicide. Burglars in particular were subjected to the bastinado (beating the soles of the feet), and the strappado (suspended in the air by means of a rope tied around the victims arms) to reveal their hidden loot. Suspected spies and assassins were beaten, deprived of sleep, and subjected to the qapani (the binding of arms tightly behind the back) which sometimes caused a joint to crack.

Also, the fact that you‚Äôre celebrating some dude who calls himself ‚Äúking,‚Äù and you voluntarily bow down to people who‚Äôve given themselves such a designation is pretty fing pathetic. But sure, go ahead and celebrate dictators and authoritarian governments, seems to be the norm in this hyper-ignorant cuckolded world we live in today. ‚ÄúNecessary‚Äù dictator... you don‚Äôt deserve democracy."

My psychologist suspects it‚Äôs Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, and I‚Äôm going to see a new psychiatrist to corroborate that diagnosis in a few weeks. Glad to see I‚Äôm not the only one.
