depression,fqzzxga,t3_glknog,1589779761.0,"Are you diagnosed with depression yet? The way it worked for me was that the doctor suggested antidepressants as an option when I first got diagnosed. 

It's quite nice getting a sense of what people think but keep in mind these aren't educated medical opinions and you are a different person with your own mental health struggles that are unique to you.

Just because Joe Bloggs says ""I took an escitalopram and had a decade-long euphoric episode"" and Jane Doe says ""fluoxetine didn't do anything for me but dry my mouth out and kill my boner"" doesn't mean that you will respond in the same way to these treatments.

There are many options as far as antidepressants and there's also multiple approaches to therapy. A lot of people I've seen actually proporting that they have recovered from depression say that they had to try a few different options before one actually helped. 

Go with what the doctor tells you. I have the personal experience that you are asking about but I actually think my experience and opinion on antidepressants is irrelevant to your personal mental health journey. In any case, I commend you on thinking about getting better and wish you all the best."

Coronavirus,fpgfu0r,t1_fpfnnqt,1588601852.0,"NZ is a great country. We spent about a decade and a half getting respectable internet infrastructure but we have a humiliating road and rail network.

We stinged pretty hard on public spending for the past decade. Lots of surpluses, our public debt is low. I reckon taking a punch like losing local business for a couple of months and tourism for a couple of years is best taken over the course of decades instead of right on the chin as it's happening.

The solution is borrow and spend. I'm a fan of big infrastructure projects because you employ a bunch of people and greatly improve future economic growth but there must emphasis on preventing people from starving, stealing or taking on bad debts in the immediate term. 

All credit is due if the government beats the spread of the virus but they absolutely can still mess up the economic response. We're way past the question of whether locking down is the most beneficial approach, we made that call and we won't know for several years about the relative health and economic effects of the different countries' policies. Our question now is making the right moves to mitigate the economic harm in this situation we have accepted."
