Meditation,fqtlxrs,t1_fqtjjjm,1589641562.0,"No no, I got many tools how to meditate because I have ADD and need just breathing isnt sufficient for me. Here go some of my methods:

1) I imagine to breath with my ears. It sounds stupid, but it “aligns” you somehow.

2) i imagine a glass box inside of me. When I am inhaling, I imagine calm color (pale blue or nature green for me), and when exhaling I imagine color of my current stresses (red, dark purple, toxic green etc.)

3) I try to focus on sounds around me. I meditate with my window open on the woods, so I hear all of nature, which is very calming.

4) What quite works for me, is that I leave my thoughts to be whatever they want to be, even those negative ones, but I always keep in mind that I am there. So to speak just observing my thoughts, not living them. It is aleight to watch your thoughts because it can give you some perspective, but you need to always know in the back of your head that you are watching it only and do not fall in. It might be hard but works quite good for me.

5) I focus on my physiological feelings. Does my leg hurt? Am I cold or warm? Am I sweating? What is the feeling of my floor touching my butt? Etc, it helps you to stay inside your body.

6) this is quite esoteric, but works for me. When meditating, I imagine yellow color on my solar plexus (between ribcage and stomach). It is a color and posirion of third chakra which helps me a lot with my issues. This might be really personal, not sure how it might work for others.

7) the last thing that I can advise you. Before you start, tell yourself when you are going to end, for example start at 6, so at 6:30 you are DONE. That way, if you get impatient, you can always tell yourself “I know exactly know when I am going to stop meditating, so theres no need to rush, no need to worry about time, because I know exactly what time it is gonna be when I end and there is nothing I should worry about”.

Hope that helps"

Meditation,fqsrgal,t1_fqrxjqg,1589616249.0,"Oh there are many of them. First of all, prior to meditating regularly, I was basically a pile of negative thoughts and anxieties. It still persists in my mind to some extent, but thanks to meditation, I found a big inner calm.

My benefits are following:

Better mindfulness, many times a day I realize the actual moment and try to feel my body a so on, which really helps with overcoming irrational struggles and thoughts.

Better discipline. The more I meditate, the easier it is to get to it and sit through. I also workout, work and even chill off more automatically.

I am more proficient in setting up my day. Before, I was a heavy procrastinator and worked 50-80% from 9-9 with smaller of bigger pauses (I am freelancer). Now it changed, I start working between 9-10 (depends on my mood), then ""Focus up"" and work with good discipline with exact pauses up until 4-5 (again depends on my mood), and then I chill of without the guilty feelings of that I should work more, because during that time I worked 95-100%. It is perfect.

My roadrages decreased to 10%. Before meditating, I was a heavy roadrager, I would provoke, race, insult everybody, drive recklessly and basically was a fucking jerk on the road. Now, even though I still drive fast and dynamically (I really love the power behind the wheels), it is not dangerous and I have zero road rages, and when somebody pisses me off real hard, my pre-meditation reaction would be blowing off and being angry for the next half of my day, and now I just tell myself in calm manners that he is a stupid idiot, then I smile and go on with my day. This is so life-changing for me.

Internally I feel really better. The life around me is somehow.. brighter, calmer, everything has a specific tint of ""it doesn't matter"" or ""life is nice"". Even bad or negative thoughts tend to be somehow lightened by the realization of mine that everything is in my head, regardless of external stuff."

I realized that the money and attitude that I can buy anything made me a fucking jerk and I still cringe a bit everytime I think of who I used to be. But I'm not anymore, so it's more like ""wow I can't believe I was like that"", haha.

Yes I agree, right now I am stuck in the wind of negative emotions towards him. He is totally not a dick, rather a very loving person. The problem is that he is willingly ignoring my totally logical request, to not spoil me. And he know it is logical, because he even agrees with me that it is absolutely alright to be financially independent, so the mere ""fuck logic"" aspect drives me crazy you know.

About the talk with him. It is really hard, he absolutely rejects ANY attempts to talk about anything personal. He is so stuck and closed even before himself that he won't let anything and anyone in. I have been trying for 5 years and my mother had been trying for 25 years, I then finally gave up (and she's a fucking psychotherapist and knows how to talk to people jesus).

He really does care about me much, but I am really long-termish angry about the fact that he is so unwilling to get better, for his own sake.

Also I would like to mention that he fucking struggles with money and still lives with lifestyle of the money he used to make when I was a child, it is gone now and he still behaves like he is the big shit, including throwing money at me like it was fucking printing paper.."

I mean yes it’s your mistake that you decided it is a good idea to shoot H 7 days in a row, and you should live with the consequences of your own actions.
