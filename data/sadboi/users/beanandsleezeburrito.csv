bipolar,flubacf,t3_fqwpwl,1585499168.0,"I am not a doctor. Nor am I refuting or disagreeing with the point being made. 

HOWEVER. If you're having side effects from your current medication that is making you unsure, uneasy, uncomfortable, etc. Anything not right. Talk to your doctor. Adjusting your meds may be important. I've read a lot of people stay depressed taking meds that weren't right for them because hey at least they're not manic right. 

This is just a side note that needs to be for those that are good at taking meds and avoiding manic episodes but still don't feel good."
