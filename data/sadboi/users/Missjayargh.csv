For me lying about an inch or two or height isn’t a big deal so long as you’re taller than me (I’m 5’2”) but I’ve been in a situation where someone did say they were my height and they were not.

I could pull up texts to show people that their partners weren’t being shady and just keep the ones where they were on the dL/deleted. People also talk in code when they’re being super sneaky 😂 “I found something nifty- did you want to see it?” Is one that’s been used in my life that as nothing to do with finding something nifty.  “Would you want to discuss this over coffee?” Not about coffee. There are also numerous ways to hide names and communicate with people. If she’s suspicious of him there’s probably a reason and that doesn’t go away. I also don’t think relationships work if someone is suspicious of who their partner is taking to. I don’t think she should need access to his phone but it would stress me out too knowing what I know.

Same with the seminar. I have for sure gone to events as a spectator and played along and was not a spectator haha. I was good and didn’t even act like I new them person.

- I was coming out of my worst depressive episode ever and wasn’t eating (coffee, candy, cereal and adderall essentially.

- I discovered how much I loved Starbuck’s white chocolate mochas haha those are like 450 calories so that did me no favors haha

I tell my friends about things I need help with in relationships. I have two best friends that are very open minded and give people the benefit of a doubt. However they don’t have rose colored glasses when I’m dating like I do and have a more objective view of what’s happening. It has been very helpful when it comes to spotting red flags. 

Sometimes people are too emotionally heated to keep talking to them about an issue. I’m not wasting time in my therapy session processing how I should talk to a partner I haven’t been dating long when I have other things to work on. Friends can help with that when a partner won’t work through it or you’re at a cross roads by giving additional ideas and suggestions that may work for you. It’s also nice having support.

I think adult friends should be able to maintain civility though- I’ve told stuff to my friends and they’ve been charming and friendly when they’ve met my partner even though they know a lot about them and don’t love them. Unless your friend is in danger I don’t think friends should wear their feelings about a significant other that isn’t theirs.

If someone I dated told me I wasn’t allowed to talk to my friends about what happened in our relationship I’d break it off because that is freaky to me. I’ve been in controlling relationships and if my partner is trying to isolate me emotionally and distance our relationship from my friends that feels like big, red flag territory to me."

I’m not saying that in a toot my own horn way or a “I’m *sOoOoO* hot”. I know I’m conventionally attractive female- I think your audience can learn to love your personality but it’s just like dating haha very few people are drawn to talk to someone they don’t know across the room from their personality. Even if it’s not sexual, people like being around people who are aesthetically pleasing.

*I didn’t start for numbers or to get big/rich because that’s not realistic for me. I’m a conservative, family friendly streamer who no longer streams on a consistent basis. I absolutely tried the titty streamer thing once or twice and got donations but that’s not why my audience is there."

90dayfianceuncensored,fo8olrr,t1_fo8m5rb,1587600683.0,"Oh I can’t recommend it enough. I still grow hair but they warned me that would happen when I got it. But the hair I have is extremely fine and sparse and I no longer get any razor burn which is worth every penny. It makes waxing a breeze, I shave my legs maybe every other week (the hair is also lighter. I have black hair and it’s like... sandy brown? And fine like my arm hair) because people can’t tell I haven’t. AND I don’t know if you shave your armpits but you know how when you shave them you can still see little flecks under your skin? Gone. Armpits look like they’ve never grown hair when I shave them now- I love it haha. 

The burn was brutal :( burn cream, ice packs and overall just being super gentle until it healed was all I could do. It didn’t take terribly long to heal but it was sad the first few days haha."
bipolar,fo8o4d8,t1_fo8m1kk,1587600406.0,"If you need do fade it quicker head and shoulders/ selson (?) blue dandruff shampoos strip color decently quick. I was trying to fade my pink (a permanent dye that time) before my next hair apt and I’d wash it twice in a row every time I washed it. Just did a good condition after :)

A slightly more aggressive but not as damaging as like... DIY stuff I’ve seen, dish soap also strips it out pretty quick. It does strip the oil out of your hair too so you have to make sure your hair/scalp doesn’t get sad being that dry- hair mask helps!

That is, if work says something. I love the different shades as purple fades naturally, it looks good in every shade."

I currently have two (work and personal) and work one doesn’t cover well and it’s been super weird for me so I just turn off the internet connection on that computer as well haha"

She’s essentially describing me (and many other streamers) so I dunno if she watches many streams. I don’t wear makeup, I’m a very conservatively dreassed just chatting streamer and I do alright haha. My folks are like “oh! Who are you? Where is _____?” Any time I put effort into my appearance (we’ve done “date night” and who doesn’t dress up for a date?)"
bipolar,fo8eey7,t3_g6aqpd,1587594976.0,"Is it permanent?

I’m also blonde and when I feel restless I use either the pink or purple Colorista dye (blue and green will stain) because they fade out in like 5 washes. The purple one is a nice lavender and fades out and then my hair is toned and ashy again which is also nice. I did pastel pink for quarantine."

I think in all the time I’ve been waxing I’ve only had one bad experience (that wasn’t caused by myself haha, those were all bad) and it was last February before I went to see my LDR boyfriend- the gal burned the life out of me. It was fine then all of a sudden she used a dab of wax that may have actually been 9999* and once it’s on it’s on and you can’t do anything about it and ooooooooo I did not love it. My pain threshold is decently high so I was like “girl that wax is a million degrees” and she sent me home some burn cream. That’s a bad time haha"
90DayFiance,fo7vtyv,t1_fo7usl8,1587585416.0,"Oooooooo your first part about PostSecret makes my eyes weeeeepy to read. Yes, and I’m the same way about talking to people if they mention they’re struggling. I’ve only recently been able to get my mental illness settled but was suicidal/self harmy for a long time and it was dark. I was pretty isolated and it’s not something you open up to strangers about - so I would try to smile at people, just to connect with *anyone* to make me feel like I was worth it? And it killed me when I would smile at people and they would look through me, or look away. It was like “damn, maybe I am worthless”. I ALWAYS smile at anyone who makes eye contact with me now because sometimes people just need to feel seen and I never want to look through someone who might be in a bad spot. 

Heavy, but yes, I love PostSecret but I will cry every time I look at their stuff cuz it’s just so much.


OH YES! My boss just recently randomly messaged me “do you have a minute to talk” and I thought I was getting fired haha. Nope, just wanted to chat about something and had a free minute."

90DayFiance,fo7rk0a,t1_fo79a5d,1587583322.0,"(I love your tag line btw haha)

I had a discussion with someone about this. Us asking “How are you?” But it’s not a question and people rarely are honest (I once told a clerk “So fucking shitty” because it has been the worst day, and they were not ready to actually have a conversation).

I would love to know if other languages/cultures have passive aggressive stuff like we do. I’m sure it happens but like “ok.”/“fine.”/“nothing.” And “we need to talk.” Are extremely neutral phrases but if they’re pretty emotionally loaded in English haha. 

If I was having a discussion with a SO (I’m assuming an argument or pre argument because this show everyone seems to fight” and someone hit me with the first three id be frustrated because that’s not what they honestly mean haha. I still get anxious when anyone hits me with a “we need to talk”— doesn’t matter who."
90DayFiance,fo7quku,t1_fo76le9,1587582975.0,"I mean subconsciously seeks out pain, wants to be rejected over and over — home girl might do well with a sadist but she’s not doing that for healthy, fun times. She needs therapy in a major way.

I only discovered recently why I was in such terrible and dysfunctional relationships with men. I was honestly scared of commitment, even though that’s what I wanted so bad, so subconsciously I was picking guys I *knew* it wouldn’t work out with because it was safer to deal with fallout than the uncertainty of what I’d do if it did work out. It’s never worked out, I’m not prepared for that. It’s really changed how I date. I’m not saying long distance, reality tv level public, international relationships with age gaps don’t work out but I feel like she’s setting herself up to fail I think. Could be on purpose because she’s scared? Maybe it has to do with her last marriage and it wasn’t addressed and that’s also why her self esteem is weird and she went hard into plastic surgery. 

Honestly that is a LOT of speculation on my end, and I’m not a psych (I’ve just seen a lot haha) but that’s my take on her right now. I know you didn’t ask haha"
