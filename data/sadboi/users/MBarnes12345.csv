Ive never been violent while delusional or having an episode, quite the opposite- I think someone's done something to someone I care about, but that I cant say they were actually the ones who did or they'll kill me, so I end up calling 911 and saying I did something. And the best part once Im stable again is realizing the thing never happened in the first place. I dont get violent. I can get angry, but I've never been a violent person, its not in my character. Been in very few fights when I was younger or anything. Sometimes while I'm stuck in a ward I've punched another patient out of annoyance of being stuck there with a bunch of people way worse off than me and get on my nerves after a month or who try to start something against a weaker individual."

schizophrenia,fj3n1l8,t3_fbcp42,1582988304.0,"Hey! To add in, during my first break I thought I was abducted by aliens or that they were gonna save us or was in a mafia/gang. Once that passed, I thought I was jesus for a long time and that lengthened my first stay.

 After that I started thinking I was the archangel michael after a weird encounter that went along with things in the bible directly during my stay, there was a man named moses and I was mad about being there so started attacking him and then someone said ""say may the lord rebuke you"", and so I did. So that delusion has been a little long lasting. 

Following that stay i learned about the illuminati and freemasons quite a bit, and that really disturbs me to this day, and I do occasionally fear them or the mob and think they're setting me up at times to make it look like I killed someone in the future, or that they're going to kill me and my family

BUT medication and therapy has helped a lot. While I was unmedicated and if I ever ""listen too hard"" the voices say things like kill yourself, kill xyz person, I'm terrible, I'm going to hell, I killed god, god hates me, etc. I grew up catholic and had fallen out of religion during my drug usage in my teenage years. more recently I've become stronger than the voices, they dont worry me and seem to only be interested when like another user said I'm doing something bad or thinking poorly, but the voices dont come up much anymore unless I ""tune in"" persay. If they're bad I just pray and tell satan to go away. He begs to stay and sometimes I just to repetitively tell him to essentially fuck off and he finally will and I'll here ""god"" talking to me, telling me he's really proud of me, etc. I've found prayer to be effective, not in asking to literally recieve something but just praying for forgiveness of my sins every time I commit one, and overall am trying to become a better person.

Sorry this was so in depth, drank a lot of coffee this morning. Feel free to ask any further questions or start a chat with me."

I'm not saying you will be 100% yourself or turn out just like me, but you will get better if you stick to meds and avoid things that can cause a relapse."

Never increased my dose, it's always been .5mg twice a day as needed, but I usually end up taking it right when I wake up and especially when I go to sleep.

Now I can have about 3-4 beers and be okay. I'm not suggesting you do the same but if you do drink do so moderately and slow with plenty of food"
