And then, the cherry on that shit cake of a year was I also got shot at - presumably by the afformentioned kid - when I drove home from work really late. I was looking for a parking spot, I drove up to the intersection right as he started shooting at another car driving across it, and I had really no choice but to gun it after the other car. He shot my car at least six times, I had bullets go through both my windshields and one in my passenger headrest. I was seriously lucky to not die. I told the cops, and I believe it in my heart, that he probably wouldn't have been trying to shoot at me if he'd known he was shooting at a random white lady. He looked like he was in high school. I hate that kid, because he could've fucking killed me, made me afraid to do things that I wasn't afraid of before that, rattled my sense of security a lot - my heart still goes out to him.

HealthAnxiety,ffryquw,t1_ffrxvrc,1580168971.0,"I'm not saying that I live in active fear of ebola at all, and by the way there have been zero cases of ebola in the US since 2014. It's just actually physically much worse and comparing the two, to me, is like apples and oranges."
HealthAnxiety,ffrwxhk,t1_ffrue0o,1580167739.0,"Hard to treat total organ failure due to massive all over body hemorrhaging, and then, not very easy to recover from that. Easy to treat pnuemonia. Not even close to the same thing. Media hype for sure but I felt (because I've been obsessed with ebola for nearly two decades after reading the hot zone in middle school and read a lot, lot, lot, lot about it wayyyy before the 2014 outbreak ever happened) in ebola's case it was justified. Ebola be scary, yo."
Anxiety,ffru0r5,t1_ffp7mj2,1580165806.0,"It will be fine. This coronavirus is like SARS, and MERS (also coronaviruses, just ones with names), which killed some but weren't the global pandemics they predicted them to be, and with low fatality rates. Even if you get it, your chances of being perfectly fine after some rest and medicine are like 96%. Do you devote any energy to stressing about the flu every year - because this is basically the same thing."
HealthAnxiety,ffrtgue,t1_ffro3a9,1580165459.0,"Okay, no, it really isn't. I'd bathe in a vat of coronavirus before I came within 15 feet of a person with active ebola wearing a hazmat suit."
HealthAnxiety,ffrt84z,t3_eupxcf,1580165305.0,"I'm literally flying into China in a month and a half (just a layover, then Thailand). I'm 1000000 times more worried about my honeymoon getting cancelled than I am about contracting a virus with roughly the same lethality as the flu."
Anxiety,ffky44f,t1_ffjfo09,1580031115.0,"It's so, so, soooooo much more minor than ebola. It's like the flu. It has the potential to give you pnuemonia but it isn't going to make you hemorrhage out of every orafice."
Anxiety,ffkxub7,t3_etw6jl,1580030931.0,"I'm going to Thailand on my honeymoon in a month and we fly into China first. Inwardly mortified, but more worried that they're going to cancel all flights in and out by then. Or getting stuck in China for the rest of my life because I have a fever or something."

cringe,fewf7j0,t3_eqnu42,1579409589.0,My best friend and I were basically sooooo excited to be the cool anime loving girls when we entered high school. Then we met the OTHER anime girls from the other middle school....and decided right then and there if we ever wanted to get laid by someone who wasn't fat and covered with acne scars we had to make a change asap lest we became THIS. ....then we became scene which was so much worse.
