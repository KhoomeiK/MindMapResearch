Yes, please excuse me. I meant to add that morals are subjective anyway. 

The quote ""No good deed goes unpunished"" comes to mind. It makes people uncomfortable to think that those who commit heineous acts will get away with it. That they deserve more than prison. 

Some would say ""Well, if hell (or insert whatever afterlife punishment) didn't exist, people would get away with horrrible acts"". To me, it sounds like saying this is just a way to reaffirm their belief. Because I guess being incredulous to the possibility solidifies the one they posit."

When you have people of your own org complaining of dwindling members, it's not a good look.

His mother and I have done this on multiple occassions and he flipped his lid on us. You couldn't even get a word in edgewise. It was so frustrating. They presume to know how you're feeling inside just because they study certain things. So their analysis of you is correct no matter what and don't you dare voice dissent.

But now I can't take them so seriously when the same thing happens to them, they lash out.

But honestly, wouldn't the point be to have a genuine discussion instead of making a statemtent veiled as a question so that you both can come to understand these things? Why make it frustratingly one-sided? What is the point of responding if they are correct in what they say?

When we're met with such horrible circumstances, especially with people wil care so much for, will can feel such a chaotic storm of emotions. Especially when it comes to any form of abuse to anyone but especially children. 

You're right, I'd be sick to my goddamn stomach. Which is exactly how I felt when one of the members who I saw as another mother retraumatized me and caused a PTSD episode. 

My body...*clenched.* Could you imagine how that feels? To have your body...clench? 

True, I must ask you, if you found out a member (or multiple) members of your chapter/disctrict retrauamtized someone, what would you do? Would you chant on it? Why?

Why is something that should need no particular thought be so hard for some people? If it were the other way around, and you suffered abuse by someone, even within the SGI, I wouldn't need to chant on anything. I would let myself feel every human emotion that thing illicits, and I would call out the member who did it. 

Are you aware of how serious these conditions are?

I got to be honest, I did want to kill myself then. Just to escape whatever my body was going through. Death would have been *grand* compared to whatever that was. 

You think about that. A member of your organzation, filled with people who have practiced far longer than I have, than I have been alive, would have made someone kill themselves. You know what that would have done to my family, who are already in financial straits? Who are already mentally ill themselves? 

And pray tell, True, what would have happened had I wrote a note about what happened before I killed myself? That would go on Facebook, to friends, to family...You see what I'm getting at?

They didn't like that, and thought I shouldn't go with that mindset. It started this whole thing, and I said something like, if you have an issue with it, want to spend the money to find me a good therapist?

They voiced some disagreement with me for wanting to use scienece or some ridiculous shit.

If they get upset, that is a poor therapist, as they usually claim we have so many methods for people to utilize. Sticking with one or a small group of methods will only be a set back.

I actually think that example is quite apt in this point. Or not even a child beaten to death, but just beaten on a regular basis. Would you tell that child it is because of negative causes made in a previous life? Depending on what those causes are (let's say, beating someone or killing someone), that, by definition, is blaming. 

You harm someone, their pain is entirely on you. *You* are to blame for their broken bones, their trauma. Your action directly affected their lives. 

So, if this child, in a previous life, killed someone, and now the cause in this life made them be beaten by their parents. That, by karma's/causes definition, is their fault. Their actions directly impacted their next life. 

I agree, not *all* forms of encouragement within the SGI is ""blaming"" per se. But to say that none are is being disingenuous. Positive intent does not equate to positive method. Just because *you* perceive something as not blaming, does not mean that others nor the receiver of encouragement will not see it as such as well. 

And let's say it isn't blaming. This does not mean the method is sound and it is not up to you or anyone else but the receiver to determine that. Spiritual methods of encouragement is not for everyone. How do you respond to someone like that?"

What I believe is that they're just following what they are instructed to do. Practice how other leaders before them tell them to. Give guidance they way they have been taught to do.

In this way, even though practitioners may not feel they're being exploited, they may indirectly be doing so. Who cares about the cause when the cost is so grand? The human cost. The cost of rationality, of critical thought, of mental and physical well-being.

And this is why religions lose members and are then dumbfounded when it happens. Eventually, people have enough and leave.

Though, this isn't always the case. This isn't entirely about Nichiren Buddhism. Sometimes, working to exhaustion may not get you what you want. Practitioners realize this and explain why this may be. 

So I ask, why leave out the most important bit of ""chant for what you want""? A friend of mine did this during a meeting of sorts a few years back, speaking to new youth. They said they promise if they practice, they'll get what they want, when they want. 

You could leave out ""but you have to work for it"" as it is common sense, right? But seeing as FellowHuman and other members have pointed this out every other time, why not then? Why not tack that on? Why not explain that they may have deeply rooted negative causes that will pose a great wall for them? Why is this told afterwards, when we join?

I can attest to this because no one explained these things to me until I was a practicing member. 

As well, explaining the flaw in their practice is an easy way to circumvent criticism, it also may be that they truly believe they were doing everything correctly. So, positing your own reason and sidestepping what you want would just breed contempt, leading to a situation you are actively trying to avoid. 

I've already heard complaints of too many people leaving or ""giving up"". At a certain point, you begin to wonder if there isn't a common denomentator here, and a change of perspective and a change of outlook, may not be needed. 

FellowHuman, I adore your passion. I also believe that you genuinely believe that these things are not blaming.

You said religion, so this is in general, correct? 

Everyone has their reasons for leaving. There are times where their experience within the religion and leaving is extremely negative. Hell, of course, this isn't always the case. 

People relay their experiences to the extent and how *they* need to for their own reasons. Disillusionment usually comes from genuine reasons, yet this sentence breathes with some sort of veiled contempt.

Karma within Nichiren Buddhism separates itself from Karma of other Buddhist sects. Instead of depowering the people, telling them they can only improve their karma/reach Buddhahood after countless lives, this seeks to get rid of that hopelessness. 

You can change your karma now, you have the control to do it *now.* 

An infant cannot do this and has no understanding of the deeper implications of those concepts. Is it the responsibility of the infant and toddler to ""change their environment""?
