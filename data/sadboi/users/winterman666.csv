MonsterHunterWorld,fqeng7m,t1_fqbua5f,1589310467.0,"Oh yeah I agree that it's definitely a defensive weapon and probably the best entry level one. Since it has low commitment and wide coverage you can be pretty safe. However as one gets better you realise there's other options that give roughly the same survivability for higher damage. Hell, even the comfort version of GL (Long shelling) was meta for a while and you can have a ton of defensive skills on it while not losing damage. That one can have Guard Up, Guard 5, Stonethrower 2, Divine Blessing Secret (5) and Evade Window 4 for defense..while still keeping Artillery 5 and Focus 3 for max damage"
MonsterHunterWorld,fqak6ev,t3_ghe3oo,1589220455.0,"There's just 2 things I want to point out. 1: Longsword and Charge Blade are much better defensive weapons. Yes, I am serious. Why is this? Charge Blade (being the most versatile weapon in the game) has a strong enough shield when charged and a couple levels of guard to rival Lance's while having it's own counter guard mechanics that let it trigger AED/SAED/Savage Axe as well as Offensive Guard. Couple that with regular dodge rolls with more iframes if absolutely needed, a decent movement speed and the potential for enormous damage per second make it an excellent weapon that doesn't slack on defense. Longsword on the other hand can boast for having the BEST defensive move in the game. This isn't up for debate. Even after the nerf to Foresight, needing a bit of meter and also having less iframes, it's still very very strong. Which other move in the game other than superman dive lets you completely negate ANY source of damage? And its not even just a defensive move, it's also a counter that deals damage to the monster after triggering. And with IB, we have an even better version of foresight damage wise but with tighter frames to pull off. Add to this the good mobility and range of the Longsword and it's another very balanced weapon. Both of them, just like Lance, allow you to stay on the monster's face wailing on them and countering every move... While doing overall more damage. You must only look at speedruns to see how inferior Lance is to them.


Which brings me to the second point, one I'm actually grateful for bringing attention to. Lance needs a buff asap. The other ""mediocre weapons"" got massive buffs in IB that really changed the way people played and looked at them. These are Hunting Horn, Gunlance and Sword and Shield. All of them got new moves or mechanics that substantially increased their power to make them more attractive to the player base. Lance did not. All it got was one terrible claw counter that gets you killed due to how long the animation to grab onto is, and it doesn't even trigger from non physical attacks. Offensive Guard is a skill that greatly helps Lance, but so does it help CB and GL.

So even if I disagree with the video's points like mobility, I definitely agree that Lance is currently the worst of the defensive weapons. And it's because of this that it needs to get some sort of buff from the developers. You can literally tank it up better with a Gunlance and deal more damage with much less skills required. That's not right. And if you tank with HBG you'll deal massive damage while still being relatively safe from harm. Which makes Lance almost obsolete."
