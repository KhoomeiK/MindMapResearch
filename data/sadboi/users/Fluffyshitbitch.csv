I used to live with the person and they started the obnoxious crazy-making when I was still living with him. At least a couple of his friends were in on it as well.

Like one time he told me about someone having squatters in their house. Then a couple of weeks later he opened all of the attic vents and my windows and acted like nothing happened.

...
The emails tracked back to his address. And i found that my facebook account was logged in on his device, which is where he collected personal  info from. We had a shared social circle at the time so it wasn’t that hard.

The person is a whole other breed of malice."

You should try emdr, processing the trauma. You feel the subconscious overwhelming emotions you were forced to repress in order to survive. In the end, it helps to bring the sensitivity to other people’s actions down. It’s scary and painful but it’s so so worth it."
CPTSD,fanirog,t1_fan1mc2,1576241794.0,"dissociation is a tool your mind uses because it frets that other poeple and reality is as painful as the traumatic incidents. Also you’re already a vet in dissociating when you had to endure prolonged trauma.

It’s not a. Scary. Thing. It’s a protective mechanism your mind uses because you once had to and your mind still thinks you have to. Emdr will help. You’ll feel the things you had to detach from to survive. It’ll get easier and you’ll dissociate less day to day.

Do keep in mind processing destabilizes you. If you have responsibilities you have to bring your a-game to, you might have to put processing off. It gets worse before it gets better. A lot of intense feelings/beliefs will come up from the subconscious to the surface and take up a lot of mental real estate."

I really like reiki, cause the practitioners are usually very warm empathetic, loving and giving people. You re-calibrate yourself to their energy.

Realistically, looking from a quantum physics perspective, everything. Is. Energy. The way subatomic particles interact is all. energy.

The way a baby calibrates to an attuned mother is energy. Skin to skin contact in newborns. Emotional empathy/mirrored facial expressions in toddlers. Feelings of safety of acceptance in children. Regulation skills from a loving parental figure.

So if you never received that, receiving it as a vulnerable(the word as in interchangeable with traumatised) adult, it is profoundly healing. It’s one of the developmental steps in psychosocial development, and providing yourself with it is invaluable. Xxx"

First, you might dissociate. That means the feelings associated with that memory are very intense and your brain wants to protect you from it. But you’re safe now. You are strong enough to feel them out and heal.

My favourite way to get out of dissociation is to get angry. Angry music! Heavy rock music. You were wronged and it’s still affecting you right. Messed up. When I get out of dissociation I get IRRATIONALLY ANGRY. black out rage. 

That’s actually great, because you can rage out by punching pillows and get that traumatic energy out."

CPTSD,f3awa4f,t3_dgapcb,1570794114.0,"Oof wall of text incomig.

Yes. It does get easier. But you have to consciously get back into those feelings (emdr, yoga, or feeling into it if your personality allows) and consistently validate, accept, love and forgive yourself. I used a lot of music about safety, love, forgiveness to help. 

I bought myself a teddy bear to clutch when I’d sink into those feelings. There was a lot of curling up in a ball and screaming going on. It was scary but I knew these are the feelings of my past self I was too young to feel. I’d eventually get the flash of the back and I’d know how old I was. Then when I snapped back to reality I’d get  angry that someone made my inner child feel that way. Protective mama bear lol.

Eventually that pain will be felt, seen and aknowledged and your inner child will chill. They’ll realise they’re safe, cared and loved now and slowly let go of those coping mechanisms that hold you back now.

I also had a lot of intrusive/anxious thoughts about seemingly unrelated people/situations, but it was a placeholder for the actual pain and trauma. My mind couldn’t grasp that my parents were so horrible I have those feelings associated w them so it thought about another person. 

I couldn’t really change that. So I just went with it and thought and felt about those people knowing that actually it’s about my family and my past. I metaphorically apologised  for using them like that lol.

I also noticed I’d get post nasal drip every time I succesfully healed a part of me! And I’d really want to dance after. Like go to the bathroom put some earphones on and have a little celebration level. So that’s fun. 

In the end I’d notice feeling lighter, the stress slighter, my emotions coming back. The fog would slowly but surely lift every time I went there.

And the teddy bear I first clutched for comfort. As I progressed it turned into a placeholder for my inner child. So it was my adult self comforting my baby. That was MONUMENTAL. Like I still stayed in my present adult self while feeling those past feelings. The eternal traumatic misery stopped. Dope.


Still got a long way to go, but it does get easier love. It’s exhausting and draining and I did odd things while processing but I did  whatever had to be done to care for my inner child. And in the end this will carry on into the future and you’ll be more whole. This will pass and you’ll be calmer and stronger.

Sending hope and healing your way."

It is very hard. I’ve always been a sensitive, curious and clever kid. So when I fell into a deep depression I started looking for answers. First it was depression/bipolar. It was something I could use to heal. It never fit quite right but it was definitely helpful at the time. I had kinda realised my self-disgust, fear and attachment issues weren’t normal but I thought maybe I was defective.

Then while browsing I found out about narcissism, codependency, trauma and neglect and abuse and everything that ties into c-ptsd. Read everything I could get my hands on. found and realised all the toxicity in my family and why everyone is the way they are.

I’ve got no idea at all about the country in general. Back then I lived a very small survival-based life and I don’t have a clear view on the culture."

I feel like a lot of people have been traumatised by the soviet repression and it’s just getting passed on generationally. Specifically as judgemental attitudes/denial of emoting/distraction/codependency/aggression/etc

Although I’m really biased. trauma is super prevalent in my family and I sought out toxic/dysfunctional people back when I lived there.

My mom is a covert narc. 2 of her siblings have passed. One from alcoholism related issues, other heart problems. One got into crime and is an abusive fugitive. Mom’s mom is a malicious narc, father died when the kids were young.

My father was admitted to an institution a couple of times. Dad’s parents are typical narc/codep. All 4 children still live together, all single, dad’s the only one w kids. Obvious intimacy issues.

I have a brother. He hates everything and everyone, including me and himself. We’re nc, obviously.

So yeah. Think it’s pretty prevalent! Sadly from what I’ve seen the culture isn’t very progressive/open to change so doubt whether it’ll be changing any time soon."
