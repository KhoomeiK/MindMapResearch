ApplyingToCollege,fheawgr,t3_etu2jo,1581518266.0,I read an email saying Ed 2 results r coming out feb 13th afternoon. Is this in New York time or does it come out at my local time?
BPD,fanbgrg,t3_e9rzxp,1576233168.0,I’ve been going through the same thing for the past year. It’s really hard. It feels like a hot knife in your stomach and lungs. It feels like betrayal. But it’s not. It’s not betrayal. It was before he met you. And he loves you and chose you for a reason.
BPD,fanbc61,t3_ea1ddw,1576232981.0,I feel you. It’s not healthy though. And you know that. So stay strong.
BPD,fanbayz,t3_ea1e0a,1576232932.0,"Yeah I totally understand. It’s fucking hard and feels like the end of the world. but I hope you get through it. If you put your mind to it, you will still fail. But one day you will succeed if you keep trying. Stay strong. I believe in you."
BPD,fanb5l1,t3_ea00m7,1576232718.0,Like concerta cuz if u take it in the morning it lasts 12 hours so ur still not hungry by the time u sleep
BPD,fana7d1,t3_e7zw34,1576231347.0,Holy shit. Thank you so much for this. I needed to hear this because this is exactly what I do and I knew it was toxic but I normalised it. I just needed someone to call me out. Thank you again.
BPD,fana46b,t3_e3eytd,1576231219.0,"Honestly I respect your post but I really didn’t like it because it sounded too perfect. I know it’s real, but I think you could’ve put in stories of your relapses too. I think that would have made me better empathise with your post. Because honestly I know everything that’s wrong with me and how to fix it, but I don’t want to. And maybe that’s what’s really wrong with me."
relationship_advice,eqm91w2,t3_byvmlr,1560158537.0,If you’re on the fence don’t do it cuz there’s something holding you back. You gotta be all in or you might regret it. But I personally think sending it is ok cuz virginity is a concept made by misogynistic men that treat women as impure objects after they’ve been fucked. Jk idk I know nothing

relationship_advice,epeu0eu,t3_buoc33,1559187045.0,That isn’t okay because they aren’t together anymore and is disrespectful towards you. I think you should bring it up with your husband first and then you should have a conversation with her one on one to tell her you aren’t comfortable with it. Don’t leave it to your husband because this is a problem mostly between you and her.
relationship_advice,epetm44,t3_buoc2q,1559186908.0,Have a serious conversation and bring the safety of your daughter into the conversation because what he’s doing is very dangerous.

relationship_advice,epaxczm,t1_epaubgq,1559134812.0,☝️
relationship_advice,epax58w,t1_epau8hu,1559134728.0,Maybe discuss with your wife and her therapist about a residential treatment specifically for bpd because I’ve heard from my therapist that those help a lot as well. I’ve personally never been to one just because I don’t want it to interfere with my education. But I also think a longer break is definitely a good idea.
relationship_advice,epaujsf,t3_bue59u,1559133646.0,"I think you should distance yourself from her, even though you probably really don’t want to, it’s not healthy for you to be so attached to her as it will only hurt you. I suggest you try to go on some dates (get tinder for some easy and instant validation) or distract yourself and do exercise or hang out more with your friends to make yourself feel better. Wish you the best of luck."
relationship_advice,epau2v6,t3_bue3at,1559133450.0,"Don’t message her. Nobody likes hearing this, but It sounds like there’s no point. She doesn’t deserve you and doesn’t seem interested. You can find better people out there. Wish you the best of luck."

relationship_advice,epatkku,t1_epasvdd,1559133234.0,Didn’t see the part where she said she was separated.
relationship_advice,epat9bm,t3_budyvw,1559133100.0,"I think you should go on a year long break with her and see if she is the person you really want to spend your life with. She needs to be in her own space to improve her situation and to learn how to not use her as a crutch. Also suggest therapy and medication as that really helps bpd (I have bpd and it significantly improved with continued medication and therapy). As bpd is quite difficult to treat, maybe continue treatment even after she says she’s better (I’ve felt better and stopped therapy and instantly went back into a horrible place). I don’t think you should give up on her, it sounds like you love her but she’s really not helping herself here. Just take a break and see what happens and see if she changes for the better. Wish you all the best."
relationship_advice,epagwwh,t3_bud3ir,1559127818.0,"Yeah, pretend nothing happened because it might start an unnecessary conversation if you clarify. It might also sound like an excuse if you say your friend did it. Good luck"
relationship_advice,epagqfu,t3_bud3od,1559127748.0,"I’ve been in the position of the girl. And my current boyfriend is in your position. I think the best thing to do is to be a good friend to her. Because it’s a new relationship she could be feeling very stressed as I have been too. She just needs to get comfortable with you, so cut back on the lovey things and just be there for her. Don’t give her too much space, I don’t know if that’s what she wants if she hadn’t said so. I’m sure she really likes you, and you just have to wait it out for the feeling to be reciprocated. 

As a side note: my boyfrjend and I dated for 1 month before I broke up with him because the lovey stuff was getting too much and stressed me out. I still wanted to remain friends. But then We didn’t talk for 5 months because he was too persistent with the lovey stuff and wasn’t really a friend. But after those months we became friends again and it was really good so I asked him out. We’ve been dating for over a year now (though we have intervals of being On and off, we are mostly on). 

Wish you the best of luck because it sounds like you really love her. Just be patient."
relationship_advice,epag1x0,t3_bud3yp,1559127434.0,"Although it’s your friend’s 21st which is probably a very big deal for him, and you for really like your friend, I think if it makes you uncomfortable to the extent that you are conflicted on going and posting on reddit about it, it’s best not to go. It’s a party and it’s about having fun, but it’s already been ruined for you by that shitty man who’s attending. 

If you do end up going, I guess you should have a big talk with your girlfriend on what you’re uncomfortable with, and decide together whether she should go or not (but if she’s not friends with your friends, I’m not sure there’s a good reason for her to go anyways). 

In the end, it’s just a party and there will be many more to come after this one. It sucks to miss one, but if you don’t have fomo or whatever then you can just make it up to your friend by buying him drinks within the week. Don’t force yourself into uncomfortable situations or feel obliged to do things you don’t want to. But if you really want to go, then make a list of pros and cons of going and see if the pros outweigh the cons. From what I hear, it sounds like the cons outweigh the pros. 

Wish you all the best."
sex,ep5ehpm,t3_bu0s5i,1559054730.0,Go for it just do it he’s gonna love it
relationship_advice,ep5dvnp,t3_bu0oe7,1559054365.0,"I don’t want to say this because I hate it when people say this to me but this sounds like a toxic relationship. If he’s still in contact with his exes and especially in a more then friends way, it’s a definite red flag. Also if it’s very up and down, like one moment you feel loved and the next you feel like shit, and it’s hard on your emotional and mental well-being, it’s a red flag. The fact that you can’t talk about it with your friends and family means that it’s bad. 

Don’t worry about the weight gain. Don’t feel bad for yourself or blame yourself for a single second. I know I only know your side of the story but the hurt and confusion you’re feeling is enough for me to tell you that you should heavily consider breaking up with him. Of course, it’s up to you, but from what I’m hearing it sounds like the cons outweigh the pros. 

I’d say break up with him as soon as possible, but if you really need to you should wait for your test result so you can have hard evidence to tell him that he’s cheating. The internet stuff is enough though. 

I wish you the best of luck, and I highly recommend you tell your trusted friend about it so that you can have emotional support to guide you through this process."
sex,ep5cq13,t1_ep5ci1v,1559053810.0,I just meant like a chat about questions that get instant replies. Sorry if I sounded like a weird horny person.
relationship_advice,ep5bxe0,t3_bu0jwb,1559053488.0,"I think as his best friend you are his moral net and you should try to have a serious and blunt conversation about it. If you guys have been friends since elementary school, you guys must have a strong bond and even if he gets pissed at you for this conversation, you should do your best to tell him your perspective so he can at least have another perspective because he probably thinks that what he’s doing is an okay thing to do. As a woman myself I would really be crushed if someone just wanted to “de virginise” me and change me and then leave to find someone else. Wish you all the best of luck in this conversation. Even if it doesn’t go the way you want it to, you know you at least tried your best."
relationship_advice,ep5ayiv,t1_ep5at2e,1559053101.0,Thank you I needed this
Drugs,ep5awew,t1_ep591d7,1559053077.0,Well thank god I didn’t get fucked and killed and hidden in a suitcase then. Jk rip that that didn’t happen it would’ve been lit
relationship_advice,ep5akwu,t3_btrrci,1559052947.0,"Two ways you can look at this:

1. Your girlfriend is disloyal because she answered ur call while she was still dating her ex and fucking them. Same can happen to you, you never know. 

2. Your girlfriend knew she loved u back then and to show him that she liked u more than him, gave him the ultimate fuck you by answering your call while fucking him. Which is in a weird way an ultimate sign of loyalty to you. 

You can decide which one fits your girlfriend’s personality better. Idk when this was posted but hope your holiday is fun/ was fun even tho it was probs awkward af. Also I can empathise with you because I always get really fucked up about my boyfriend’s past too."
relationship_advice,ep59v8e,t3_bty3er,1559052652.0,"What happened to me was similar in the way it made me feel but nowhere near as bad. I empathise with you and I want you to realise that they are both scum for doing this. Move on by getting a new hairdo, find yourself a hot tinder date and a new best friend. Neither of them deserve you. You fucking go girl 🤘🏼"
