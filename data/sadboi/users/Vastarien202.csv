You brought me a book. I opened it and began to tread the black-lettered path of words. A path, a road, a stream of ink forming images that filled my cup and ran over and out onto the grass as I went.  All unknowing, I washed myself clean; dived down and filled my lungs, sprouted gills and circled its currents. I’d been wracked with the dust of living, a post-surgery crackle of thirst unfed for far too long. 

At last the pages ran out, and I sat bewildered at the abrupt descent of gravity. I reached out and gathered another. A different sea called and I flew to follow, sprouting feathers and broad wings. No son of Icarus, I kept sight of my shadow over the lands below. The breath of green forests rose to lift me, the hard silver shine of water held me in momentary radiance as I passed above.  When these pages were spent, I made my return, fierce-eyed and full of warrior’s songs.

Rose is young, following the culture script that she's not completely sure she really wants. Her husband isn't the kindest man, and this slow reveal of his brutality gets worse the more he feels insecure.

Finally he drugs her, then rapes her, while she dreams it's the Devil. Now she's lost her trust, her sense of reality, and is forced into motherhood before she was ready. Trapped in a fancy prison where everyone else takes what they want from her.
She can't escape. She can't run away. She can't even talk about her suffering, because ""everything is normal, YOU have the problem"". 

She's miserable, lonely, scared to death, and she knows all this is being done TO her. In the end, her child really is the spawn of Satan, but the Devil is not the scariest thing here. 

Rosemary's story is frightening because it's personal. It happens every day to women all over the world. In a very real sense, this is a movie about being a woman in a modern culture.

witchcraft,fog6l2n,t3_g7b6gd,1587748576.0,"3 nails, a mirror, some red yarn/string, some red pepper flakes and rock salt (table will work if you have none other). Two ways to do this : 1-if you have a clear footprint or know where they stepped (and you haven't!). 

Take one nail, drive it into the footprint and sprinkle that spot with salt and pepper flakes. Tell that bastard that he will be unable to move forward in his life and he will be ""pinned in place"" to itch and burn and suffer until he gives back what he took or repays you in some way.  Take the other two nails and put them where the item used to be, on top of the mirror, so your item will be all he can see or think about.   Run the string between the points and swear that he will be ""hung""  between one place and the next until he returns what's yours. 

Way 2: 

Take the 3 nails and bind them with the string to the mirror. One should point out, the other two left and right (you can glue them if you must). Wrap that string tight at least 3 times, nine ideally.  Sprinkle that charm with pepper and salt, and hang it near or right above what was taken, so it can spin in the wind. Declare that he who took it will burn his hand and be plagued with pain until he gives it back or has fair repayment. Every time that mirror spins, the hex is cast against him and he will find it very hard to break it. 

When you're satisfied in either punishment or payment, undo the string and bury the nails somewhere they won't be found. The mirror can be cleansed and re-used after a month or so of being hidden.

The way I see it, the Story itself is a kind of Gnostic fable which is meant to enlighten and guide the reader to a greater Understanding of their own creativity. 

The Empress is our own living Inspiration, Imagination incarnate. In Her, we behold our deepest desire. In Naming Her, we begin the work of manifesting that WISH into our own life and making it real. 

The Nothing is the force of passivity, conformity, that which Consumes but never Creates for itself. It is literally the Blindness of the Inner Eye. When we give up our natural drive to Create, to Imagine, to make real Wishes for ourselves, we become a further agent of the Nothing. We become Empty. 

This is what G'mork is telling us when he admits his mission to Atreyu; ""People without hopes and dreams are easy to control.""

Before he crosses the border, Bastion is deeply at risk of being taken by the Nothing. His father is unable to give him the love and openness he needs, and the situation at school is no better. What you are seeing is not a child being rebellious, he's acting in self defense to preserve his original soul.

Once across the Border, Bastion is manipulated by his past unfilled needs. He wants to be strong and handsome, clever and brave; the things he didn't see in himself. This is given, but it makes him arrogant and prideful. 
He's going from Want to Want, and losing himself in the gratification of false needs of his ego. 

The House of Change is pivotal. Here, he gets his deepest Need met. He recieves unconditional acceptance and love for himself, and is finally able to begin to truly care about other people. 

He is eventually able to find his hidden desire to help his father through his grief, and in realising that Compassion, he gains the insight needed to speak with the AURYN Themselves. He returns as a Whole person, able to consciously choose the WISHES he makes for himself. 

This is the full meaning of the inscription, and why it's important to resist the Nothing in our own lives. The more Names we give the Empress, the more our lives and Art improve, and the richer all our worlds become."
books,fo9xdgh,t3_g6htys,1587634005.0,"I have a replica of the AURYN. I loved that book as a child, and aside from the stupid ending, the film has its merits at times. What I love most about it is how deeply layered the story really is. 'Do What You Wish' is THE prime Command which it's critical to obey as a creative person.

Bastion thinks it means that he can do whatever he WANTS, and wastes his potential, causing harm to himself and others. Doing what you truly WISH is another thing; it requires bravery and Will far beyond most people's ability. It means discovering your true Dream and making that happen. It gives you something to lose, and that is terrifying. 

Choosing your Dream, Naming it, IS meeting the Empress. Hell, I could be here all day dissecting the deeper meanings, but I have the feeling you already know ;)"
