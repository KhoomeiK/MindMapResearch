mentalhealth,fiuvufy,t1_fitxuzr,1582749200.0,Wow this makes me so happy!! So glad so many of you tried or like this idea!! It was a serious game changer for me as well! :)
mentalhealth,firdgs9,t3_f9e4qz,1582662292.0,"I used to have a really hard time with this, my therapist suggested a couple of things, but the only thing that stuck with me and actually worked, (it's so weird, but honestly don't knock it till you try it) was when i'm saying something to myself like ""wow you're so stupid"" or just like constantly putting myself down is to take what i'm saying in my head and then say it back in my head as if I was like a reporter announcing what i just said. For example ""wow I'm so stupid and ugly"" you would say ""THIS JUST IN: (your name) thinks they are so stupid and ugly!"" as time went on honestly it just started making me laugh instead of focusing on the feeling i was getting from the thoughts and helped clear my head. The more i did it the more it worked and now i honestly rarely say negative things like that when it was an everyday, constant in the past. There are other methods, but this one really worked for me, and maybe it would help you to?"
