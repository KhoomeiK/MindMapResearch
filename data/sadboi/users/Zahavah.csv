AskReddit,fl0vcz9,t1_fl0itkj,1584716539.0,"Times will be tough for a while. My field is being hurt quite substantially currently, and the projections were saying that it will take about a year to clear up. Best of luck with the job search- they Indeed.com for golf jobs or the delivery jobs for sure."

AskReddit,fl0hjrs,t1_fl07i4f,1584706628.0,Fellow Mainer here- apply at a golf course. They are all opening really soon so people can get outside and not go stir crazy. All the courses are now hiring their grounds and maintenance crew. Anyone can do it- and itâ€™s wonderful being outside all day. Source- husband runs a golf course.
