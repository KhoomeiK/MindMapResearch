I met people in the past with bad acne and it is okay, it's not their fault, and some of them are beautiful AF because beauty is different for every person imo. 

Just shower anytime u can, be a kind person, have a humour that it's not cruel with others around you, don't be resented with everyone around you... It is not that hard honestly. Many people will find you handsome if u stop being a jerk."

Do you feel that you will be happier without having a kid? Then abortion is your best choice. Do you feel than abortion will be more trauma for you? Then adoption is a good choice too. And of course, the last option is that you can keep the baby. If your family or the people around you helps you, it can work out. Won't be easy, but it can. 

Any option is good, there is no judgement here. But sadly you are the only who knows what is best for you (and who can see how are the abortion laws on your country, I really hope they will support you if this is what you need). 

Best luck and I really hope you will learn to manage all that trauma and find your way to be happy."
