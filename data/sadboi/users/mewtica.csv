AskWomen,fn37yhb,t1_fn37gp5,1586615019.0,"Well actually, we're currently broken up, for 2 months and we've both realized a lot of heavy but important things about our relationships. Especially that we love eachother so incredibly much. But I know deep down I cannot keep up with his sex drive. He could masturbate 8 times a day every day and be fine lol. I would be very heartbroken if he chose to move on and find someone else but the truth is if you aren't compatible, you aren't compatible. And sex is a huge part of connection and compatibility in a relationship."
AskWomen,fn36zqx,t1_fn2ufw3,1586614381.0,"This is how my boyfriend feels : / He has a much much higher sex drive than I do, while I haven't felt an ounce of desire or attraction or felt sexy or desirable in 7 years. I'm only 28 and I've been with him for 5 years. It's caused so much stress and strain in our relationship. And of course I want to feel alive and sexy and of course I want to lake my boyfriend feel like he's desirable...but I just have zero drive no matter what. No matter if I run every day. If I eat salad for breakfast lunch and dinner, no amount of squats or yoga or sunshine or if I stop taking medications have helped. He grows so distant when he feels undesired. And also stopped initiating because he felt like it was one sided... theres not much i can do unfortunately so the choice to stay with me is on him : /"

It will get better. I swear.
I used to be homeless years ago at 17 years old. I thought my life would go no where but I kept pressing on, got my finances together while I lived in my car, lost that same car, bounced around a lot all while working 2 jobs to pay for college out of pocket because I was too young to get financial aid on my own...eventually I graduated and got a huge scholarship to the school of my dreams and now I live in a wonderful home.

But unfortunately the side effects are horrible. No sex drive. Hot flashes and being constantly sweaty or warmer than everyone else....

I lose hope from time to time about the reality of antidepressants and if there is really something that can truly help... or if it's  all a lie. BUT I'm here to tell you to keep on pressing on! Because one day you will find that something that makes you say, ""ahh finally"""
