mentalhealth,fr6dd8t,t3_gmxo47,1589924222.0,"Yeah, that's the eternal question. I see it like this: it takes someone with a special sort of empathy to understand a partner with mental disorders. Many people are biased and very closed off to the idea. Others have suffered distress or even trauma because of their relationships with people suffering mental illness. This creates an aversion that's understandable. 

Healthy relationships are based on honesty and trust. In the spirit of transparency I disclose my history, and the amount of time I have been in treatment, up front. Sometimes people quit talking to me immediately. Sometimes people pretend to understand then ghost me over time. Either way, it's best to discover that as soon as you can rather than put emotional energy into a relationship that is doomed to fail. That's my policy. Sometimes it works out, a lot of times I feel very alone. But I would rather be me and be alone then coupled up with someone that I have to lie to in order for them to like me."

The good news is that's it's over, and the farther away you get from the show the less people will remember your contribution to it. Time does heal wounds. Not necessarily anxiety but the pain you feel after enduring that experience. Eventually, the world will open up again and you can see a therapist. That experience will help you process and reframe your negative emotions. It's not something you're going to have to live with forever. 

Wish I had more to say. I will leave you with this. I know full well what it's like to have other people drive you into instability and illness. I have been saddled with a lifetime of depression and anxiety because of the choices others made. It used to make me very angry and destructive. But that causes more hurt and more damage. The way toward healing is to accept the situation as is. It's undeserved and it's a burden. Blaming yourself for your own suffering isn't helpful. Becoming angry and bitter isn't helpful.

What nobody talks about is that happiness comes from within. The search for external sources of happiness leads to a temporary feeling of satisfaction that soon subsides into more emptiness. And so they cycle continues.

Anxiety and depression rob us of the motivations to chase any dream, be that an aspirational one or a material one. The first step to overcoming the pointlessness of your life is stabilizing your mood. I did that with medication. Some people do it with lifestyle changes such as vigorous exercise. Once you found a foundation of stability you can move forward with therapy, goal setting, and making positive changes. 

The reason people don't enjoy life, regardless of their mental condition, is finding happiness takes a lot of work, and patience, and an underlying willingness to change.

Hiding from mental health problems is a certain way for them to deepen. It will likely rob you of your future as untreated illness takes over more and more aspects of your life. The longer you permit this cycle to continue, the harder it becomes to break free."

Of course you feel alienated and full of angst, people around you treat everything like it's a commodity. Including their own families.

There is nothing wrong with you, except you refuse to settle for less than you deserve. I think you sound awesome."

Tell her she will never feel whole again, never find the courage and strength to resume her life unless she gets therapy from a trained doctor who specializes in trauma. Tell her that if she continues to put it off her symptoms will increase and PTSD will take over her life. Tell her she has value and she is worth the effort it takes.

Advice,fqnc3a7,t3_gjvidx,1589492221.0,"A big part of confidence is accepting your flaws. People often think the problems they have are insurmountable. Typically they have limited tools and they're using the wrong things to fix them. Problems are easy to repair when we gain the right tool. So have some sympathy for your own struggle and have the courage to keep looking for answers. Make small changes, say positive things to yourself. It really doesn't matter if you consider yourself smart or not. What matters is that you continue to try. We all fail. Not everyone gets back up and continues to try."

These people exist regardless of what the internet provides them. I think the opposite is true. I read people's stories about crushing depression and anxiety or horrendous personal trauma and at the end of the story they ask, is it me overreacting or is it something else? If you feel overwhelmed by the amount of information about mental health then stop reading so much content related to MH. Here's a secret. When people are confused about their health problems, the seek professional advice from an actual doctor. Try that."

TooAfraidToAsk,fqn3eg4,t1_fqn1dd9,1589487999.0,"I went numb for 30 or 40 years so I'm not the best person to ask about health emotions LOL. To this day my emotional reactions are delayed to the point it takes days for me to realize something was upsetting. What I do is sort of like the act of remembering. Instead of events or names I am trying to remember emotions. I think of a recent event and I search for an emotional reaction that's buried inside me. I use quiet introspection to see if there is something there. Sometimes I discover a well of emotion and I allow myself to feel overcome and move through it. Other times, I have no emotional reaction to something (like getting fired, for instance) and I simply accept that I've moved on and I need not dwell. Not every loss requires an emotional outpouring. Sometimes if we're circumspect, we find out we feel okay about things. Having little emotion is only a problem if we're hiding them. 

Developing a strong emotional core where we feel grounded, not swayed by events, is the other reason people become less emotional. They are healthy and balanced which renders them relatively insulated from loss. It's up to you to decide if your hiding from emotions or you are philosophical about the circumstances that lead others to have more intense reactions."
TooAfraidToAsk,fqn11rd,t3_gjtv4d,1589486872.0,"Sounds like some emotional numbing. It is a problem because those emotions will eventually return, and it's likely to be in a flood. When we numb emotions for a long time we have a hard time feeling anything. Then, a trigger will unleash them and we get uncontrollably emotional. It may take years to happen but it always happens eventually."
mentalhealth,fqn0jgr,t3_gjtavv,1589486626.0,"When it comes to diagnosis and treatment of mental illness no, ignorance IS NOT bliss. Under a century ago people with mental disorders were routinely locked away and tortured. That was considered ""treatment"" in a time of gross ignorance. People were treated like animals, often worse. Now, we have medication and treatment models that allow those of us with illnesses to remain in society. I am grateful the ignorance of the past is gone and asylums are shuttered. Ignorance breeds fear and fear breeds violence and mistreatment. Why would anyone want to go back to that?"

Advice,fqmvc3y,t3_gjstpf,1589484140.0,"Nobody speaks out to say how greatful they are and how much they appreciate their life choices. People like to bitch and the worse off they feel, the more they bitch about it. So, this is why you're feeling like it's all negative. 

It's a difficult occupation, especially alone. My exwife had a three year old when we met. Soon after we were married and I took over daily childcare. I adored being a dad. It was lonely because I really didn't feel like I could fit in with the moms at the park. But the time I spent raising that girl into a young woman was the best time of my life. 

Do take care of yourself. You have every right to feel anxious and unsure. I hope you have family or other support in place. Keep an eye on your own mental health. If you continue to decline into melancholy and lack motivation it's a sign of depression. Many women feel guilty or ashamed for feeling this way because new mothers are supposed to be these glowing, happy people. Get help for yourself if these moods do not improve. Postpartum is very real. There is no shame in getting help to right your chemical imbalance."

If they want to go bargain basement they can, but it'll be a very stripped down version that's produced at that cost.

Make it a point to state these ideas are a team effort and not your own unilateral decision. Nobody likes a cowboy.

If you have private insurance then you can seek therapy outside the va. Obviously this is the better option if you can afford it. I had nightmares for decades. My wife would wake up to my sounds and caress me until they were over--she told me. After a year or two of therapy I asked her if she was still doing it, still getting woken up. She said no, the dreams had stopped. The nightmares are echos of trauma you have not addressed. Once you sort out that trauma, the symptoms subside."

She did this exercise 5 times a year as a PM, at least. So, first you should be aware that cost overruns are common in software development. We don't know what we don't know, so it's impossible to accurately assess manhours for new technologies. 

More than anything, we want a stable work product with an intuitive UX. Stress that goal means extensive quality control measures like beta testing and debugging. Reiterate the commitment to produce the best possible product. In the end, the client still wants the product. Few people pull the plug because of an overrun. Generally, the trade off is additional production benchmarks that the client receives as a way to evidence the quality of work. Sometimes a client is happy to pay higher costs if that means production itself is sped along and the product is available sooner. 

These are the circumstances to keep in mind when reaching out to a client to negotiate the matter."
Advice,fqmghth,t3_gjq0js,1589477060.0,"There are online career aptitude quizzes you can take to help define certain roles you'd prefer over others. Also, it's not uncommon for high school students to take a ""gap year"" before they enter college. Ideally, this time is spent exploring volunteer opportunities or internships that will provide you with some life experience and help direct your future energies.

Another way to go about deciding is simply by doing. Take classes, expose yourself to new topics, new ways of looking at the world. See if that experience creates a spark. 

There are two ways of looking at college. The minority look at it as an opportunity to receive a robust education and become an articulate, worldly individual. I did this and I am certainly interesting to talk to, but being interesting doesn't pay the rent. I went away to become more self-aware and escape an unhappy home life, not to prepare for a career. 

The majority see higher education as a stepping stone to a desired job field. Neither one of these reasons is the right or wrong answer. However, because costs are high it's far more practical to choose a major and pursue an occupation within a growth industry. You might spend the next few months researching what sectors are growing (or predicted to grow) within the economy. That's where new jobs will be created."

We cannot choose what we think about; we can only choose what thoughts we pay attention to. These intrusive thoughts are increasingly concerning because you're continuing to pay attention to them. You can make them diminish and disappear. 

Notice when the intrusive thoughts are starting to form. Do not indulge in the thought. Simply acknowledge and move on to another thought about something else. As you pay less attention to the intrusive thought over time, you will discover its frequency diminishes. In time, the power gets completely robbed and the thought goes away entirely."

Btw, there is no such thing as being free from intrusive thoughts. That's why they're called intrusive. We chose not to afford any attention to these thoughts, and their impact is diminished. Our intrusive thoughts are related to comfort, validation, and self-soothing. The more we can practice ignoring the intrusions, the more opportunities we have to redirect self-talk to something positive.

this is why it's extremely important to make disclosures in a safe setting with safe people. If your friend group skews toward extremely racist and homophobic, you're not among safe people. The betrayal of trust hurts, but it was almost inevitable given the age and disposition of these peers. It's done. All you can do is be yourself. 

I will leave you with a story about my high school experience. I was very shy, didn't say a word to people about myself. I lived in a very isolated and unhappy head space. Our school was small.
