>I'm still a learner and from what I've been taught, ECT can be very effective for treatment resistant depression. How much side effects do you usually expect from clomipramine vs ECT that you would first try clomipramine?

ECT comes with its own problems: it's expensive, so depending on where you live and what insurance you have, it can quickly get un-affordable. Then there are certain problems with ECT, e.g. the side effects like long-term memory loss and cognitive impairment... and let's not forget the high relapse rates.

It can be highly effective for a short period of time, but it is no long-term solution, imho. For many something like Ketamine infusions or Ketamine nasal spray (sublingual) might be better suited and cheaper / more affordable, depending on where you live.

That's why I would try Clomipramine before ECT. When it works it is a more sustainable and affordable long-term solution. And in many cases it works magnificently. Side effects can be sometimes burdensome, but so is debilitating depression.

The study included 166 outpatients, randomized to double-blind treatment with sertraline (50-200 mg) or clomipramine (50-150 mg) for 8 weeks. The efficacy of both treatments was similar, 74% of patients in the sertraline group and 71% of clomipramine patients being classified as responders at the end-point, as defined by a Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 or 2. Mean HAM-D scores fell from 29.8 at baseline to 12.3 at endpoint in the sertraline group, and from 29.6-12.7 in the clomipramine group. There were more withdrawals due to adverse events in the clomipramine group than in the sertraline group (17% versus 12%). Dry mouth, tremor, dizziness and constipation were all substantially more common in the clomipramine group, whereas diarrhoea/loose stools was more common in the sertraline group.

Short Abstract: *""While some early studies suggested that SSRIs might be less effective in the treatment of melancholia, the results of these may have been biased and confounded by several side-effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), which might contribute to their apparent efficacy. It appears, however, that the SSRIs may vary among themselves in their apparent efficacy in melancholia. In this regard, sertraline may be more efficacious than other SSRIs and similar to TCAs in the treatment of patients with melancholia. Several studies have suggested that the presence of melancholic features may predict a good response to sertraline, and it has been hypothesised that this may be the result of the relatively potent dopaminergic activity of sertraline, compared with other SSRIs."" - Source:*  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9808081](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9808081)"

He came here saying that Fluoxetine and Escitalopram did nothing for him. Escitalopram + Bupropion combo did nothing for him. Buspirone did nothing for him. So in light of the facts it's only logical to suggest pharmacologically different classes of medications. The same goes for combos."

> “dirty SSRIs”

You mean TCAs. And ""dirty"", meaning ""non-selective"", is not always bad. Selectivity is a marketing term from the 90s *(think about it: is Vortioxetine selective or non-selective / dirty?)*. Hitting more targets can contribute to its effectiveness. Especially the sedative properties *(antihistamine, 5HT2 antagonism, anticholinergic etc.)* can be useful for a subset of patients: Think of anxious shaky skiny guys without appetite but with insomnia. Such patients *(high somatizing patients)* don't do particularly well on SSRIs. There are of course exceptions.

Depression kills you too. Ineffective antidepressant kill you too. It's a benefit-risk assessment: you can try the potentially dangerous but highly effective medications, OR you can stay on safe but ineffective medications end ""enjoy"" your life in pure hellish agony. I am not saying that TCAs and MAOIs work for everyone, but generally speaking they seem to work better than SSRIs.

> Gee, I wonder why they aren’t used so much anymore.

Because they aren't patented anymore. Because doctors are more interested in covering their -legal- asses. The same reason why many doctors are pushing their patients on(to) Pristiq, Trintellix and other overpriced crap."

So because TCAs were godawful for you, they will be awful for him too?

Sertraline isn't a MAOI, it's an SSRI."
