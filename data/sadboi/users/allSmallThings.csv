Water boils at 100 C or 212 F?

WRONG. At the right atmospheric pressure, when the water is perfectly pure, when the heat source and boiling vessel are just right, it will be pretty close to this number, BUT never exactly!

Different parts of the water will be in different phases. Some water is already boiling off at 50 C. Why? 

Now all the water reaches 100 C. Some refuses to boil away and fights the state change. Why?

The approximation is FAIR enough. It is useful. We have to remember it is still an approximation and still keep our energy flow active and dynamic. 

Yesterday my truth was X. Today it doesn't work any more. My truth is now Y. 

I speak with a good friend. I was missing some pieces. My truth is now Z. 

Last week I hunted and ate deer, and it tasted great. Deer meat is good. 

Today, a small piece of deer gave me a headache. My body does not like it today. Deer meat is bad. 

The UNIVERSE and LIFE is each a **permanently dynamic** dance. All ancient wisdom knows this. 

Living towards pure joy, is being at bliss with the dynamic dance, always floating, free of any desire to grasp at some ephemeral truth, which is only an illusion. 

If anything is closest to the truth, it is the eternal dynamic dance."

We do need an honest dialogue, which is currently lacking. 

In many professions, a few bad apples spoil the whole team's reputation. Each professional community needs to work harder to prevent this. 

Corruption is a global problem affecting all major industries. You can find the quote from a former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine saying how modern studies can't be trusted anymore (For example, studies that are privately funded show 5x the effect of a given medication versus the government-funded study. Hmm.)

If your corrupt car dealer ends up costing you a fortune, it sucks, but you will get by. If a corrupt doctor gives you a surgery you don't need, you may be seriously or permanently injured. Medical error is the #3 cause of death in the US. That's crazy!! 

The food industry is partly responsible for the obesity crises, the medical industry is responsible for medical deaths and the deadly opioid crisis, and the auto industry is responsible to reduce the terrible car death rates we have. Where is the sense of civic responsibility? 

Politics has the responsibility to moderate discussion on all these topics. And politics is a corrupt mess too ...

It's a complex problem and I don't know any easy solutions. There is a lot of work to be done on all sides. 

At the very least, things can start to change when each of us knows when to say NO and cries bullshit when we see it.


edit:

‚ÄúIt is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines.
