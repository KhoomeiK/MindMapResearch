They would drill into us that we were the first line of defense and had to absolutely follow the rules and tell the customer no until they got irate, only then do we call a manager, and then the manager gave them whatever they wanted. Which doesn't make any fucking sense to me because it's not like they're given what they want and they leave, they're given what they want and get to come into the park and harass the other employees and guests inside. The worst type of managers are ones who don't stick up for their people."

Did you see X (movie or show)? I thought it was really good and I can't stop talking about it

But as nice as they might be always keep your guard up with them. They will probably report back to the group if you were to share anything really personal. Maybe one day you can create your own positive inclusive girl gang to defeat the evil ones lol

Edit to add: It's a proven tactic that asking someone for a favor will actually improve their perception of your relationship since it comes across as a form of trust. Obviously this isn't true in some cases like if the request makes no sense or if they already don't like you. Also using their name when you say hi will improve a relationship faster."

I wouldn't have expected additional moves to be such a thing. So is any additional move considered a ""TM""? You can get more than 1? Is your aim to get a better variety or generally more powerful moves? Are they necessarily big power-up moves or small(?) moves. Sorry I don't know proper terms for them.

dogs,f9j051p,t3_e4zsw9,1575351087.0,Ive been a dogsitter and walker off and on for years and I interviewed at a doggie daycare facility. I noped out of there for a few reasons but a major one being that the first paper they give you to sign basically makes you say you are fine with getting mauled and that's just part of the job. I asked what their procedures are in the case of aggressive dogs and basically they had none. No sticks or hoses or pole leashes to break up fights or anything. I am NOT putting my safety on the line like that it's absolutely not worth it. I have also developed somewhat of a fear of larger dogs in recent years. I've had too many bad experiences with people letting their dogs run off-leash.

If you're really bad at art you can do an acrylic pour or one of those other abstract painting methods that are fool-proof. Or if you have a little bit of skill you can make something with stencils, or copy a picture of flowers or something like that. I have a bit of skill so I started making paintings related to their hobbies.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,f6puff9,t3_dsj9a5,1573064503.0,"Well at least you got the first step down which is recognizing you have a problem. Something you may not realize is that this all stems from selfishness. The best way to help yourself is help others. You’re focusing entirely on how everything has to do with you, how you have to be the best, no one else can be pretty. I would actively try to befriend girls that you instinctually want to shy away from. 

A good place to start could be that you compliment them and ask how they do their hair/makeup/style and if they have any tips. But then Im sure you can also find something less shallow in common with them as well. We’re all just people, and even the prettiest girls like yourself can feel hella insecure sometimes. 

Also, if you worry about anyone being two-faced or laughing at you behind your back, just know that’s not on you to be prepared for. If you can be genuine and kind in the face of that fear that is a strength and not a weakness. And anyone who does that is just a jerk. Not your fault"

AskAnAmerican,f60kwb0,t3_dq22wu,1572619810.0,"At my school (Southern US, big city, graduated in 2014) we had 8 minute periods between classes to switch with four 90 minute classes, alternating on an A- and B-Day schedule. We had 4 different lunch periods because it was a large school 3,000+ students. If I remember correctly it was something like 38 minutes. Which lunch period you got was generally based on the grade level of the class you were in after lunch but some classes like extra-curriculars (agriculture, art, foreign language) landed you in a different lunch period than most of your friends. We weren’t allowed off-campus for lunch but some people would sneak off anyways. We were also not allowed to roam the school grounds and had a particular area in and around the cafeteria we were allowed to hang out. For people who bought lunch or had “free lunch” they had 3 meal choices, all pretty unappetizing and typically American food. The line to get lunch was very long and wouldnt leave students much time to eat if they didn’t rush to get there first. I brought my lunch and I still didn’t really have time to do anything else. I’d just try to find friends to sit with and chat a bit. Some friends wouldn’t really eat and played MTG on the cafeteria tables."

Frugal,f4067zw,t1_f3zzb8l,1571286433.0,"Huh! That’s interesting, I’ll have to look into that. Making my own tea would be cool"
Frugal,f3zxpb5,t1_f3zx5l0,1571279459.0,"I actually never thought to use canned mushrooms and Idk why, since I only ever eat them cooked anyways (in pasta, stir fries, and casseroles) so that’s a great idea! I really want to get into making legit bento boxes so I definitely want rice in my life lol. I think between rice, potatoes, pasta, and tortillas I have a great carby foundation for sustainable cooking"
