science,fk8hdlf,t3_fgxj75,1583956063.0,They're an invasive species and have devastated islands and countries like Australia and New Zealand where there were no predators for some animals before. We keep them inside and used to do supervised walks on leash. Now we have an ever expanding cat patio. They're perfectly happy.

I started a 10% off sale yesterday to see if it would help but has not yet."

Just so you know!  Edit; nm, duh, figured it out."

science,f342ggh,t3_dei73a,1570649403.0,"All of you who seemed concerned with the cows, pesticides and painting cows, how about you just stop eating cows and eventually this won't be a problem.  ""How can I keep my food from being bit by flies"" sounds really stupid, just stop eating them, that will be nice to the cows."
explainlikeimfive,f20wp9r,t1_f1z059s,1569864994.0,I believe you are contagious before and days after you are sick so people who appear well and feel well can still spread it. üòü
Dualsport,exiqv53,t3_csh0g2,1566333777.0,"I love my xt225 that I've been riding for about 6 years. I do lots of oil changes and keep her clean and it's never had issues, even as much as I drop and crash it in the woods. Hasn't even needed rejetting at elevations from 10 ft to 11k ft.  The biggest problem is that it's very cold blooded. Sometimes getting it started can be a pain and it will punish you if you try to leave too early. I've had half a dozen shops look at it and it's just the way it is they all say, but once you get it moving cold or hot, it's spry as hell. I can do anything our drz400 and ktm 440 can do (aside from really long hill climbs). One drawback is that it's air cooled and you will know when it's hot pretty quick so be prepared for breaks if you spend a lot of time in the forest in summer or long mountain climbs. I've never had problems or confusion getting parts for my '06"

whatsthisplant,evugcvd,t1_evud0e4,1564794501.0,Great! I love Columbine. I usually see it at higher elevations though. I put it in a pot for now til I find a place.
depression,evq82gg,t3_ckmvf8,1564688271.0,I would try to write things down and plan ahead of time what you're going to talk about. Even if you're just reading it unemotionally it can start a dialogue. I keep intending to do this but mine is pretty good at poking around at me until I realize something that needs to be talked about. Either way works.
