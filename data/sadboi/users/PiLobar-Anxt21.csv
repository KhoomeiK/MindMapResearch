Its just that when your drunk you are already stricting oxygen from your lungs thus that buzz you get in your brain. (alcohol is a respitory depresent). and cocaine is also a respitory depressant so you crave that feeling because cokes adds to it. i know from experience. it also probably means you have mixed alcohol and coke before and as dangerous as it is it feels too fuckin good."
