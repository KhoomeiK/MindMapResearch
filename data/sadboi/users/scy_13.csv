However, my report is simply about the people who are being prescribed Adderall and it doesnt work for. There is no tirade against the drug here, I simply asked what peoples experiences were. My professor for this report thought the topic was, in fact, a great ""intellectual undertaking"" and I find the responses here to be useful, especially the ones with positive experiences. Thanks for the feedback, but theres no personal vendetta here, just gathering information."

I also suffer tremors as a result. During my time of using, I experienced significant weight loss and depression, as well as insomnia and heart palpitations, of which I was hospitalized for twice before I quit. The purpose of this post was just to examine the subjectivity of the drug and learn of some others experiences. My own opinion is the way it is because of the research Ive done and my own personal issues."

I agree when you say she will probably do it whether she has your support or not, so making it as safe as possible is all you can do. But like I said, I think its always best to wait. The damage they have been able to do to me makes me weary of younger people doing them. Psychologically, psychedelics have heightened my anxiety, made me question myself, and even sent me to the hospital after a suicide attempt while tripping. Its a fickle thing, one you have to be very careful with."
