Whether it was soda or coffee, it got me through the day but as time pass; I notice my anxiety started to go out of control and develop kidney problems so I decided to stop drinking caffeine soon after I graduate. The moment I stop drinking caffeine was a day after my birthday and the withdraw I had to go through was horrible. It started out with small headaches then eventually got worse. The headache lasts over a week and a half. The pain was so bad that my husband had to get me Excedrin migraine pain relievers because I couldn't focus properly and had to sleep on the floor due to dizziness. During the withdraw, I didn't eat very much, was more tired than usual, couldn't concentrate, and sleep in a lot more. I even remember my husband telling me to see the doctor because I looked so bad but thankfully; after that final awful headache, I felt pretty good and continue on not drinking any caffeine. By doing this, there was a huge difference in my health such as having less paranoia, anxiety, nausea, and having a better appetite. It's been 2 years since I stop drinking caffeine and its one the best decisions I ever made. I don't have to worry about kidney pain, muscle soreness, lack of sleep, and most importantly; saved a ton of money!
