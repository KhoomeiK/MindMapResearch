legaladvice,fgphmqv,t3_ezrx03,1581004971.0,"Hello. My sons dad did the same. We fought in court, I didnt have a lawyer, and his family had called CPS on me which opened an investigation. They made false statements that I had ripped a door from its hinges because I was angry and that I had been involuntarily taken to a mental hospital for more than two days. I had documentation to prove that they lied about the mental hospital. The truth was I went voluntarily and it was a two day stay, and I went because of postpartum depression accompanied by grief (my mom had JUST passed away when my son was 6 weeks old). I wasnt perfect by any means, but they had very little to use against me and while they did manage to get 50/50, they could not get full because I was a fit parent. I did not have a lawyer and he did. Look for local legal aid services. You can sometimes get free guidance that way as far as what forms to file and what evidence you need. Have you been served papers? Is there already a court date? Its frightening, especially when you are pregnant, but if you have a job and can support yourself for the most part, or at least some family you can stay with, chances are he is not going to win. If my ex didnt win while I was in that horrible situation, it's very very unlikely your ex will win if he has nothing against you. Just document EVERYTHING that you do for your child."

AskReddit,fdzmtxz,t1_fdz9kss,1578791837.0,"Hard agree. I text my boyfriend a lot because we live 3 hours apart, but when we are having visits, we have texting for communicating plans. We save the conversations for when we're hanging out."
AskReddit,fdzja0c,t1_fdyonlu,1578790749.0,"I havent ever waited for a guy to state his intentions before I started mine. I believe that out of the 4 guys I have had a relationship with, I asked 3 of them out before they asked me. It just simplifies things, especially since they always say they didnt know I was interested in them until I said something."
AskReddit,fdzerk4,t1_fdza8th,1578789544.0,"Idk, I've got proportionally HUGE boobs and they sag to the bottom of my ribcage. Nipples are also at completely different heights due to size differences between the boobs. No bra time is for the bedroom because they only look okay either with a bra under clothes or with nothing at all."

Assistance,fdzbdik,t1_fdzagco,1578788493.0,"It's probably too late for this, but we did something similar. She was an organ donor and we opted to go through with the donation. Hospital expenses and cremation were covered by the hospital. It was a very big help."
bipolar2,fdz9zj2,t3_endf4j,1578788113.0,Well that was surprisingly inspiring. Now I feel more motivated to do something about my apartment!
bipolar2,fdrftly,t3_emu3bd,1578683954.0,"For hypomania: fight your urges. Literally no one had told me that before, when the doctor said that, it rocked my world. Simplest advice ever.

For depression: doing something halfway is better than not at all. If you can only brush your teeth for 30 seconds, or work out for 10 minutes, or if all you can do is get wet in the shower without using soap, those things are better than not trying at all. If you begin to do something, it also increases your chances of finishing that thing."
BipolarReddit,fdivb26,t1_fdh6gex,1578451842.0,"Oh yeah, lol, I know about the tv thing! But I agree with this. I do a lot to keep up with my moods, and I've never had issues caring for my boy, even when meds are off or something."
BipolarReddit,fdiv56c,t3_eldhfz,1578451736.0,"My son is 5. I am a single mother and while the dad is in the picture, hes a huge source of fear and anxiety for me, because he has tried to gain full custody of my son before on the basis that I had stayed in a mental hospital for 2 days (voluntarily I might add). I have thought long and hard about having another child, because when I became pregnant with my son I did not know that I had bipolar disorder yet. I'm still not sure what I will do but I think I'm going to use an egg donor for any future children. It's not ideal, but it gives me peace of mind that I'm not potentially hurting someone in the future by sharing my mental illness genetics. It may also be important to note, my mom passed away from bipolar right after my son was born which might be part of why I feel the way I do. I feel like if she was still here, I might not be so worried."
bipolar2,fcvkxvh,t3_ej4789,1578004312.0,Yes definitely!
BipolarReddit,fctf94i,t3_eiq29s,1577941379.0,"Uggghhh ME! I was so much more lively, friendly, and fun before. I had some hobbies and interests. Now I'm just a shell of the person I used to be."
