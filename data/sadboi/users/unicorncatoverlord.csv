CasualConversation,fkjbmb8,t3_fit4g8,1584241355.0,"thank you, unknown angel ‚ù§ . i work in a market basket store. we have to sanitize every buggy, machine, little hand carry basket, anything anyone possibly touches. on top of making sure we are keeping ourselves sanitized. we have been so busy, it seems nonstop. sometimes we work well through our breaks and past our scheduled time to clockout. i wish customers understood the hassle their ""hoarding"" or whatever you want to call it at this point is putting on us from: trying to make sure things are clean, getting lines of customers with buggies full of groceries out the door, and well...sanitizing again. yet we still get crap when something doesn't ring up correctly. 

üëâas a cashier, here is my advice to everyone:
if you or your kids are sick, please stay home. go to the doctor to get checked out, please. i am not afraid of this virus. i am afraid of the elderly or kids/infant babies who can't fight off these types of illnesses as well as others can. please SANITIZE YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY. do not give me or your local cashier your damn boob money (it happened to me yesterday). do not be upset if we refuse it, it is nasty and in my opinion unappealing. make sure you have your card/wallet for cash ready at the register and please do not be on your phone. it is quite rude as we are trying to get you in and out and you are not paying any attention to your surroundings... if you are shopping keep in mind there are PLENTY of people who are also trying to shop, some with babies who need purified water, and i am not here for the whole ""boil water"" bit. don't be an asshole. if that's the case, what if the tables were turned and there were no water's left for your infant. remember that. don't take the nursery water meant for the infants, if you do not have one. be kind to others. keep people in mind. always take what you NEED."
