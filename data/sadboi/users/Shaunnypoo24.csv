shrooms,fjlftcf,t3_fdoa8c,1583445862.0,"Update: Realized I had the correct coir (reptile made) and reviewed sterilization process for grain and coir, it was as I did so I ruled out a few things (incorrect coir and improper technique). The grain bags were fully colonized and had 0% contam according to the pictures and few real life times I have seen it (to the best of my knowledge). Assuming it was at the time of transfer to tubs, so Ill review that and try again."
