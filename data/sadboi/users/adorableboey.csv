relationships,fbz8bg5,t3_efa19v,1577238229.0,I would just talk to him (your friend). Let him know this girl sucks and he should be the one to end it and that you‚Äôre there for him in the mean time. None of this is your fault. He shouldn‚Äôt want to be with someone who not only doesn‚Äôt understand his mental illness but doesn‚Äôt seem to care to try to understand or at least be compassionate. Help him see that he has lots to live for and that tons of people with depression find ways to live with it and have meaningful lives..
