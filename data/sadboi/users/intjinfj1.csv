I am still working to figure out when and how this occurs, typically between the 7-8 year mark which is a long time repressing thoughts and feelings to not have to deal with the real issues. 

My first Ex was Bi-Polar and I was very young and naive enough to the world that I allowed her to attempt to use homeopathic methods to treat this, which placed a financial burden that at that age was difficult and caused me extra stress. This was compounded after she attempted suicide twice. She still refused medical help and I ended it.

Second wife had her own issues that she never talked to me about until after year 5 that she had been raped more than once, which explained soooo much, but she kept leading me on about being unsure about starting a family and at the end of it all she didn‚Äôt. So this one I had to end as well. 

This all leads to my current pickiness, I can‚Äôt even really call it avoidant, I am just incredibly guarded and I have built a huge wall that I am scared no one will have the patience to climb or attempt to break down. Now being 39 I am very fearful that the family life I want to have and create might not ever be a thing for me. I do exactly what you do and use successes at work to distract. I am trying to put myself out there and make new friends as a start and just let the puzzle pieces fall into place and hopefully find that missing link some day."

What I can tell you know is you need to forgive yourself. Take the time to talk it out in your future relationships, don‚Äôt hide it, the surprise is the most difficult part and with the surprise comes massive amounts of misunderstanding. Just know there are other amazing supportive people out there and you will find them, keep on the path of healing, don‚Äôt ask what could I have done, cause the past can‚Äôt be changed, look forward to how you can change the future."
BPD,f50p3jf,t3_d9fpyc,1571930756.0,"I ended up having to break up with my girlfriend due to BPD, she didn‚Äôt know she had it but I caught her cheating and lying in the worst way over an entire month and she called me paranoid and crazy over it. Was constantly berating me for wanting to talk and compromise in the relationship her way or the highway. She is finally getting the help she needs I hope. I only talk to her through text mostly because she still owes me a lot of money. I really wish I would have know about this before and been able to know how fine of a line you have to walk with individuals with BPD. I mean that in a good way, I still care for her greatly and it tears me up how we went from soooo great to this state in a matter of a month."
