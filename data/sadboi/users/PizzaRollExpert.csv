While using recursion directly often makes it a bit harder to follow the way that the program flows the, I prefer using the higher order functions to writing loops since loops always rely on modifying something outside of the loop and the relationship between the loop and the outside thing it's modifying isn't made explicit by the structure of the code.


---

For those of you not familiar with fold, here's an example of what it looks like in psuedo-python. 

Instead of writing a sum function like

    def sum(ls):
      if (empty(ls)):
        return 0
      else:
        return head(ls) + sum(tail(ls))

You'd write it like

    def plus(a, b):
      return a + b

    def sum(ls):
      return foldl(plus, 0, ls)


Using foldl you don't even need to worry about making your function tail recursive!"

    let b = [ x*x | x <- [1..10] ]

do notation expands to more things than just lists, like IO-actions and error handling! Don't worry to much about it now though.

In Python you can use ifs in list comprehensions to only include some of the results:

    -- Haskell equivalent

    divisableBySix = [ x | x <- [2,4..18], x `mod` 3 == 0 ]

If using do notation, guard is used to filter out values we don't want. It basically means ""unless the following condition is met, throw away this iteration"". It won't work how you might expect outside of do notation though!

    divisableBySix = do
        x <- [2,4..18]

1. It's not really explained what ap does.

Or: `Applicative p => p (a -> b) -> p a -> p b`

2. It is defined in terms of flatMap. ap is a broader function than flatMap because there are things which you can implement ap but not flatMap for. Ap doesn't require a notion of flattening.

3. ap is convenient in Haskell because all functions are curried. A typical usecase is if you have a curried function that takes two arguments and two applicative objects you'd map the function over the first object to obtain an object with functions as values and then ap it together with a second object.

The only thing I was trying to say is that if you built something that looks like the stuff in the gifs and doesn't have any pumps it will trivially halt. This doesn't apply to all fluid based systems. A u pipe wouldn't do much to save this poor strawman that I've constructed.

Your analogy about resistance in electricity is interesting, but I'm not even sure what we're disagreeing about really?"

Personally though, they're far from the first band I've heard to write so far about breakups and feeling lonely with very blatant and relatable lyrics and I don't think that they do it particularly well.

But maybe it's also a case of me finding a stylistic choice annoying that someone else finds charming as a matter of taste, and it's fine to not have super deep or elaborately crafted lyrics if you're still fun and charming which a lot of people seem to think that they are."
