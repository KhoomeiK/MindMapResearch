microgrowery,f96ffp6,t1_f96bj7p,1575144286.0,"No. I also had the fans on which I believe made humidity drop. I turned them off. We'll if no light is needed then I can turn them off although they supply a heat source.

Also I may have underwatered the first time around. I didn't use a spray and I used minimal water when I first plotted. The white-ish tint it had makes me fear for rotting. Maybe it needed more water though cause I feel like I u derwatered.

Classic noob lol"

I was able to find it although it seemed a little white-ish in tint. I found a spray bottle and moistened the top layer of the soil pretty darn well(didn't soak it though). I also covered the top with a little glass cup to preserve humidity. The seed now rest about an inch to 1 1/2 inches under.

Do you think the light top will harm it? I was under the impression that it had to be under 24 hr light after planting. It is an auto flower too btw I don't know if that makes a difference."
