I try to bridge that gap by reminding myself that the only difference between a man and a woman is that of genitals and that is it. For example dating and sex life, There is no way that I can ever experience attachment to somebody like a woman and tv would have me believe that its vastly different so the word ""female"" is just a reminder to myself.

Sincere people exist more than your thoughts would have you believe but everyone goes through their own problems. Even seemingly confident people can have moments of self-doubt and feel like they might be annoying the other and maintain their distance My advice to you would be to stop keeping track in our friendships, If you are keeping count and feel like nobody cares about you. Be the person who you want others to be. I know that this is easier said than done and it took years for me to perfect this habit. Once you stop counting how many times you texted them first and actually text them. It will get better.

BPD is also very misdiagnosed and your mind can do a wonderful job of coercing you into believing what you might have. I do not the reason why your brain would do this but I would suggest that you stop researching this topic until your official assessment because this might reduce the credibility of your assessment.
