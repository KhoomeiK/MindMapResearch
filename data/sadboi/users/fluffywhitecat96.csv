I can’t keep up a relationship because I just don’t even want to go out and see them, which is so fucked up so I never have relationships anymore. I sleep in until like noon or more and then stay up until 3 in the morning and when I’m awake I always feel like I’m in a fog. I know I’m a disappointment to my family. I guess I really just don’t care anymore. These last three years I’ve really deteriorated as a person. I haven’t worked since October and I have no will to go back."

depression,fewsa17,t3_eqnbva,1579418729.0,"Yeah it’s the worst when people glorify something so horrible to have. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. Nothing is cute or quirky about feeling like you constantly want to die, or feel like your a disappointment to everyone. You don’t laugh about how you want to just sleep your life away, or you don’t feel anything anymore and when you do it’s just negative emotions. Depression is not fun, nor is it cute or funny. Some people cope in strange ways, but it’s just not a joke. Because when people take things like this as a joke, nobody will take you seriously when you really do need help."
