Did anything happen recently that could explain why it is like this? (Major changes in the tank? Gone away and couldn’t vacuum?)

Edit: judging by your post history, your lotl needs a bit of attention right now. Get two tubs: keep it in one (with daily 100% water changes) until the tank clears up, then steep some 100% black tea (no other ingredients), cool it down, then soak him in it for 10 mins.

As I said, Lotl is very underweight. I’ve seen worse, but you need to take its nutrition very seriously or else things can end badly. When you freeze dry anything it takes a lot of nutrients out, and blood worms themselves are already not ideal. Go to the pet store and see what you can find immediately: repashy grub pie, sinking pellets, or even frozen bloodworms. 

For now, feed daily (offer food in the am and pm), then remove waste / left over food using a turkey baster about an hour after the feeding. 

Ultimately having a pet is a big responsibility, so please try to explain to your grandmother the gravity of he situation. Getting live would be best long term, but ordering grub pie or getting pellets can be a compromise."
