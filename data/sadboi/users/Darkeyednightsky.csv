One day I walked into the livingroom and the door to the front yard was wide open, he was sitting on the couch obviously proud of his self, all of the other animals were in the front yard and I had to wrangle them inside.

It just isn't as easy as it could be.. also to be noted, she always says ""work"" but that seems it could be anything from dealing with horses to fixing something in the house.

Have you considered an ultimatum? I know you mentioned her throwing a tantrum when therapy was brought up. But I wonder if she would go if she stopped getting ""fun money"" until she goes? It might be something to consider. 

I think it sounds like she tricked you into believing she'd be a great housewife and actually she just didn't want to do anything with her life but play a game. You've made this really easy on her. I know she might not financially need a job. But she might mentally need something... be it a job, or productive hobby outside of the house. Staying at home so much is not healthy. My husbands mother was/is a housewife. She has no purpose. Her children are grown. She has zero hobbies, no work life. No friends. It's a sad existence.
