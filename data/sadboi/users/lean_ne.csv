I saw a psychiatrist for this anxiety, and was told it was a form of OCD if you want to look into that. Not that the label is the most important thing, but it might be helpful in getting more anecdotes and support. 

Some ways I cope:
- Write out a very detailed plan, with buffer times and all. (This is another problem in itself, but it’s a step towards not sitting idle). For example, if I had that appointment at 5, I would work backwards: leave the house at 4, pack my bag at 3.50, shower at 3.30, etc. Let’s say I schedule backwards until 2pm, then I know for sure I don’t have to worry about this appointment until 2pm. If I think about it before that, I just review my plan to assure myself that I know what I’m doing, and try to relax/do other things in that time
- Letting a few close friends know about this, and asking them to remind me that schedules aren’t everything if they catch me obsessing

With feeling like you might have contaminated the bags, I think that it is completely justified to feel what you're feeling. But you took precautions with the wipes, and sorry to stereotype but I'm sure you're more hygienic than the average person going to Walmart right now, so the chances are low.

- Start small. Start with a minute, or even 30 seconds, of trying to quiet your brain. Don’t be intimidated by 5 minute to 30 minute “meditation guides”. Those are useful once you get the hang of it, but just ease yourself in first. Set a timer for one minute and close your eyes. Don’t be frustrated when thoughts come: it’s natural. Acknowledge them, push them away and keep breathing. You’ll be surprised how quickly the timer goes off
- Try it when you’re at your calmest, not when you’re already anxious. Meditation is a skill, even for those who may not suffer from OCD or anxiety. Our minds are not trained to be quiet.
