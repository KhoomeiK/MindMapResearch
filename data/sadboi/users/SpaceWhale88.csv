Dentistry,fr1e02g,t1_fr1dswf,1589818060.0,If your pockets are deep and you have tartar under you gums waiting on treatment will just let the infection fester and lead to more bone loss in the meantime. Call your office and ask for a full exam and xrays. Ask what your pockets are.
depression,fr1dqwp,t1_fr1d9ue,1589817931.0,Google what its like to drown. Its terrible. You could jump off a cliff and survive and have a long and painful recovery. You need to lose a lot of blood to die. Slitting your wrists that badly is painful and slow.
Dentistry,fr1dip6,t1_fr1d7ff,1589817815.0,"The stains probably can only be removed professionally.  Just do your best job and try to get in, if your office has opened up hygiene.

That might be longer than a year from now."

You may need a deep cleaning. The goal is to stop the progression of the disease. If you have future concerns, you can post a picture of your full set of xrays."
Dentistry,fr1b8v2,t1_fr1atzh,1589816668.0,Ok. I cant say for sure you have deeper pockets. The upper right later incisor looks pretty inflamed and the pocket could be 3. . .could be 6. Just get a full gum evaluation at your dentist to be sure. People who are under 35 with attachment loss can have a more aggressive form of gum disease but it sounds like it could also be chronic if your hygiene has been very poor for a long time.

EDAnonymous,fr09kjj,t3_glwyim,1589788019.0,Same here. When I go back to work my clothes won't fit me. I'd need to lose 10lbs at least in like 2 weeks.

Dentistry,fpwkvb0,t3_gfwfim,1588965238.0,What you can do is prevent further buildup. I highly recommend getting disclosing tabs on Amazon. You chew them up and swish it around with your saliva really well then rinse out. It will dye all soft plaque bright pink (also your tongue and some lips so do after your zoom meeting). Then you brush off all the pink. You have tartar buildup because you aren't brushing off all the plaque. Doing this every once in a while helps to train you how to throughly brush.
