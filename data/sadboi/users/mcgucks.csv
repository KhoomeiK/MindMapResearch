ConservativesOnly,fquafje,t1_fqu71fc,1589655154.0,"There isn’t a way to get them fully safely, that’s the point. Going through shipt, grub hub, etc all has the same amount of risk. The only way to “safely” get supplies is for everyone to remain in lockdown to limit the spread of the disease. This is not to say that gradual reopening should not take place. For example, I agree that most if not all shops should be allowed to reopen as long as they maintain proper prevention (masks, gloves, only a certain amount of people per square footage). That is entirely reasonable and will provide the economy with more stimulation to prevent a national debt crisis. However i do not agree that people should carry on life as it was before-going to parties, hanging out with multiple people and multiple groups in a day- and for that reason, the lockdown is necessary. I have already explained my point as to why we cannot just “quarantine the few” because there is no safe way for them to access needed supplies without exposure. The reason why the lockdown protocol must remain is because, the minute it is removed, we will begin living life as normal and by definition, spreading the disease further. Again, totally agree with gradual reopening even in social standpoints. Maybe just hang out with one or two people period, girlfriend/boyfriend and best friend, so that you can have social contact but not excessively spread the disease. These protocols should not remain forever and I do believe we’re getting to the point where they can be eased but they must be EASED, not erased. We must slowly transition and continue social distancing (yes, this includes parties and large group gatherings as well as hanging out individually with multiple people per day) to prevent the spread from spiking again and causing further outbreaks. Play by the rules now and you can get rid of them permanently. However, if you give up on the purpose of these rules now, they’re going to return."
ConservativesOnly,fqu93jc,t3_gkr7gr,1589654412.0,"Yes my point exactly. Someone , somewhere does have to handle it. And whether that someone is my mother or a shipt employee, it really doesn’t matter, the amount of exposure is the same. So therefore if there’s no real way to limit the exposure when getting necessary items then the solution is for most everyone to follow the shelter in place orders so that the spread is limited. Therefore when the handler we’ll call it goes to a store, the risk is minimal and calculated. I understand the rules are tough, however they are the rules for the reason that there are no other ways to limit the spread. If you are saying this simply because the lockdown sucks and you’re bored and you want to see friends again, shame on you for being so selfish as to put the health and lives of people like my sister and millions of others at risk. However if you are protesting the lockdown due to economic concerns, I would focus more attention on protesting the governments response financially to this. Demand more small business loans, more stimulus checks, etc. Because if you are truly in this for the economy you should know that if everyone starts life up as it was right now, the economy would suffer an even worse depression than if we remain on lockdown."
ConservativesOnly,fqu4bu1,t1_fqu398j,1589651768.0,How do you propose the obtain food and medicine and supplies and stuff without exposing themselves?
