If I can give you an advice, try to do as many things as you can do on the day, so when the night comes you will feel ""happy"" to finally go to bed. It usually works for me. Also there are some phone apps for hypnosis, meditation or ASMR, it can help too. 
But I think that if you want this problem to be definitely solved then you will have to find what makes you anxious about sleeping, that's the only way. Maybe you should think about going back to see you therapist and talk to him/her about it"

Like i dont need to think about things that make me anxious, it just comes like that, like it's in my body and sometimes I even wonder if I don't have a physical disease or something.. which makes me even more anxious just to think about it lol"
Anxiety,fckfs7k,t3_ehnjv4,1577724350.0,"Your mother probably just don't understand what anxiety feels like.. try not to take it too personnally. I think it's her way to try to make you take your responsabilities even if she doesn't really know how to help you with that. My mom used to be like that with me too when I was your age, it took years for her to understand that I wasn't able to do anything about it.. 
But if I can give you an advice you should try to do these things you're unable to do like making a phone call to take an appointement for exemple, or taking the bus by yourself.. it will be very very hard and stressful at first but it will get better, and at some point you will be able to do it easier than before. I'm not saying that one day it will be as easy for you as it is for most of people but it could be a little better, and maybe if your mother sees that you try she will be more understanding. Whenever you feel ready just try, step by step and at some point confidence will come by itself"
