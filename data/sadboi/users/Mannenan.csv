ptsd,fq6qwa9,t1_fq5h68z,1589136636.0,"Hi! Thank you so much for your response.

I think I’ve been patient and tried to let her tell me things in time. I’ve mainly been struggling at supporting properly and in the right way. Im pretty sure I do trigger her and you’re right that I take it personally, I feel like a terrible person for messing up and it really upsets me, so I’ll try and work on that.

I’ve always struggled with boundaries in the past and have no real idea how to establish them or what they should even be. I often feel like I have no idea if my feelings are valid or wrong or incorrect. But I think she’s a genuinely good person so I hope we can work on that together.

Thanks again!!"
ptsd,fq6q8do,t1_fq2w5sn,1589136333.0,"Hi! This was so so helpful, thank you.

Your bullet point really resonated with me. I’ve definitely been learning that this is the right approach and trying to adapt to it. Still got a lot of work to do on that and I often feel like I’m saying the same thing again and again.

The encouragement really helps too, thank you. I’m not sure I’m comfortable asking for a trigger list yet but I’ll keep it in mind. 

And I’ll look at some YouTube videos tonight, thank you!!"

Sums up my relationships quite well, intense and powerful, moving far too quickly, often with me trying to be everything that person wants, we almost become a pair of FPs if that makes sense, and I want to make them happy so much.  Then I slowly unravel when I realise they aren’t actually what I want. 

Great question OP"

I’ve written about the date on the other comment - it went great! I’m definitely going to have to bear the slow thing in mind, my brain is already moving at a million miles an hour and I don’t want to suddenly have an FP that I hardly know. 

But yes, having someone see something in me and see me in such a positive light was truly lovely after such a long time of self doubt and feeling utterly pathetic. Thank you so much again, I hope you’re doing great!"
BPD,fk7gwnp,t1_fjuhfjw,1583936208.0,"Hi again! Thank you so much for your reply, and apologies for the delay, I needed some processing time. At first I was truly uncomfortable, but she was honestly seemed so warm and caring that my initial barriers started to break down. It was lovely, I didn’t sabotage, I definitely found that goodness. We went for lunch at a market, then took a walk around a beautiful park. She asked me if I wanted to go for dinner, I thought she meant in the week but she meant that evening! It was so lovely. You calmed me down a bit, thank you. I’m of course a little worried about being too intense too quickly and about the potential for flare ups, but this is a good test for me and I’m feeling confident. Thank you x"

I’m going to try really hard to focus on her and making sure she has a good time, that’s what we can be great at. If I can be doing that, then hopefully everything else can fade into the background. Making someone I like or care about happy is the best thing in the world.
