TwoXChromosomes,fpbd3la,t1_fpb3tqz,1588467266.0,"Look, I can only judge you based on your words, which seemed to be that you were that you were insistent on a Catholic wedding in a Catholic church. Which certainly made it seem like you were not willing to entertain any Jewish traditions. 

Buying a menorah doesn't mean you can't harbor some anti-semitism that you might have picked up as a child. That you are so being so defensive about this, and not even considering that you have unconscious bias, is weird. Most people have unconscious biases about groups that have historically been demonized/marginalized by society. 

Regardless, you should obviously break up because you aren't compatible with this person and neither of you are mature enough to be in a relationship rn."
TwoXChromosomes,fpaxz8d,t1_fpatb92,1588458047.0,"Refusing to allow a rabbi to participate in a Jewish person's wedding, or to allow Jewish traditions during the wedding, comes off as anti-semitic. As though you don't want to acknowledge that person's culture, to erase it. You may not think so, because like, people aren't very objective about their own actions, but it comes off that way.  If your mother is anti-semitic, and you know, a lot of people her age are, you might have some unconscious bias there as well.

I'm not saying you're maliciously anti-semitic, I'm saying you probably have some ignorantly anti-semitic views. The first step to undoing those views is acknowledging they might exist."
