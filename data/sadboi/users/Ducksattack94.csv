I never felt overwhelmed, but since you are the only one there to care for the client you might have gaps in your lunch. In my area a lot of the agencies don‚Äôt give very many hours, which is why I went back to working in an assisted living. Plus I like the faster pace."
vegetarian,fmpjn51,t3_fwom81,1586282025.0,"A black bean burger created from what I could find in my kitchen before I  venture out to the store again. The liquid from the can of beans works well as a binder. I used two different types of beans, but I think any kind of bean you like would work in this. I eyeballed the spices, so adjust to your liking.

Recipe

* 1 can black beans
* 1 can great northern beans
* 2 cups cooked white rice
* 1 large shallot diced
* 3/4 cup frozen or fresh bell peppers diced
* 2 slices bread of choice or breadcrumbs
* \~1 tsp paprika
* \~1/2 tsp garlic powder
* \~1/2 tsp onion powder
* \~1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
* \~1/2 tsp garlic salt
* \~1/2 tsp pepper

1) Toast slices of bread until dry. Baking in the oven at 275 F  will help dry it out even more. Once bread is done chop up and set aside.

2) Heat a small pan and add oil. Then saute the shallot and peppers until cooked. Set aside

3) Drain the can of great northern beans and save the liquid and set aside. Then add the black beans to the the strainer and rinse.

4) Add the bread and the pepper/shallot mixture to a food processor until it resembles bread crumbs. Then add the beans, rice, and spices. Add the bean liquid as needed until it forms a paste, but still has texture. If it has a hard time blending add more liquid. 

5) Flour your hands and shape into patties. Cook in an oiled pan until crispy. Patties are somewhat delicate.

**Bun recipe**:  [https://www.instructables.com/id/bread-recipe-1/](https://www.instructables.com/id/bread-recipe-1/)  

* After the first rise of the dough, I cut the dough into 9 pieces and shaped into buns. Then let rise again. Brushed with olive oil and baked at 375 F for about 17 minutes."

For seasoning I used soy sauce, mushroom oyster sauce, kecap manis, and a little bit of sambal oelek to taste. Plus salt and pepper.

I cooked the garlic, onion, ginger, red pepper, and green onion for few minutes, then added the frozen veggies (already steamed) and rice noodles. Cooked until it was heated through then added sauces and spinach. It makes about 3 good sized servings. That whole plate wasn't all for me  ;)"
