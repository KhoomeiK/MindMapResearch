AskReddit,foqujdk,t1_foqtns9,1588001074.0,"That's so interesting! I am so curious and I want to ask you lots of questions (if you don't mind):

Do you like funerals?
Do you have a very detailed plan your own funeral?
What's the shortest funeral you've been to and which one took the longest? In how many percent of the cases do people only wear black?

What do you think a funeral means to the family and friends of the deceased? Does it have a deeper meaning than just putting a body into the ground? Or is it a very pragmatic act? After so many funerals, are funerals still emotional/spiritual special to you?

Does the thought of death scare you less since you've seen so many funerals?

CasualConversation,fonn6zs,t1_fonl60h,1587922703.0,"Scenario B: you want to share information (e.g. talk about trains). Before randomly sharing information make sure the other person is interested in the subject. I would advise to make some small talk and carefully introducing the subject. For example, start with a general question about the other persons life/interests (""so, how is your day going? Did you do anything fun today?""). After appropriately replying to their part, they will most likely ask you about your day/life. That's your chance to start talking about your interest (""I had a nice day, worked on my train models."") Now begins the tricky part: you must interpret their answer and read between the lines if they are willing to talk about your interest or not. Usually a question means they are - to some extent- okay with the topic. However, it is important for the conversation to stay balanced, meaning it should be approximately equal parts for their and your speech time/writing amount. Try to ask back questions to keep the conversation going. Usually open questions are better than yes/no questions."
CasualConversation,fonmfb5,t1_fonl60h,1587922290.0,"Step two: think about why you wanna have a conversation with this person. Do you need some information? Do you want to share information? do you just want to talk to someone? 
Depending  in where you want the conversation to go, you need to spend more or less effort with the small talk after the greeting.
Scenario A: you need an information. 
I am pretty straight forward when it comes to this and don't bother doing Smalltalk before I asked my question because I feel like its more honest not to play around if all I want is an info. Questions should be introduced by a friendly ""may I asked you..."" or ""I have a question  maybe you can help me with that"". Generally speaking people like to be in charge and like to be the expert. So by basically telling them that they would help you, are smart or something like this, they will feel good about themselves and therefore help you a lot more. 
Questions should be specific, clear and always end with a question mark. Avoid confusing  or- questions because technically ""yes"" is a logical answer to the question ""is this sweater green or yellow?""."
CasualConversation,fonl60h,t3_g8hvkj,1587921597.0,"There are many steps to have a proper conversation. First step: the greeting. Depending on the relationship and the platform, you might choose a collegial ""hi"" (seems cuter and younger) or ""hey"" (which I prefer) or the very neutral ""hello"" combined with either nothing or the name of the person (but it could be creepy if they never told you their name and you know it anyways) or a general ""you"" or a more specific term depending on the circumstance like ""redditor"". You should avoid greetings that somehow include a judgement (""hey stupid"" or ""hi sexy""). In some occasions it might be appropriate to start a conversation without a greeting.
So that's step one."
