entitledparents,fgywl2n,t3_f0uwj7,1581188082.0,"I feel bad for that one child who apologies for his mother. It must be so embarrassing to have to do that on behalf of his parent. 
I think the cake throw was a nice little bit of revenge"
relationship_advice,fgys5o0,t1_fgxzzu8,1581186388.0,Idk how to get it through to you that rape is rape no matter what gender it happens to. Not holding women accountable for their actions is just as bad as not holding a man accountable for his
depression,fbyl1e3,t3_ef4960,1577219610.0,I’m in almost the same situation with having older parents and not much else family. I was really hoping to feel even a little bit of christmas happiness or spirit. But since I’ve been home I’ve spent most of time alone In my room as I can’t be bothered to go do things with my parents. It’s sucks and I wish I just had some motivation or drive to do something fun
AmItheAsshole,f0yklra,t1_f0yk5vz,1569072305.0,"I’m only speaking from personal experience but if I had done anything like that at 7 I would have been in so much trouble. Like some noise and a bit of mess is expected for young kids, but there’s a line especially in someone else’s home. Kids aren’t stupid"
AmItheAsshole,f0y5ck4,t3_d78nmj,1569061198.0,"ESH the mom for having a kid like that and the kid acting that like in someone else’s house. But you really shouldn’t have shut him in a room, even if the kid is a disruptive brat"
AmItheAsshole,f0vxys3,t1_f0vvzdl,1568994471.0,I get what you mean. My anxiety makes it so that disappointing anyone or making things awkward makes me wanna fake my death and flee the country
AmItheAsshole,f0vvklt,t3_d6wal7,1568992844.0,NTA you can't help your anxiety and you did try to explain multiple times that you couldn't do it. Seems like the others backing out made you a consolation prize to the bride and that's a really crappy way to be treated. Also the way your family yelled out you and treated you like you were just being dramatic makes it even worse. It's good that you did get help and are better now.
AmItheAsshole,f0tod6v,t3_d6jiyy,1568925932.0,"NTA the men in this are all shitty. They need to be taught boundaries and how to read a situation. All you were doing was trying to preserve your safety and job, it’s a horrible situation and I really hope you’re able to report it."
AmItheAsshole,f0tnuhp,t3_d6jq9c,1568925643.0,NTA if the police are telling you to call an emergency number this person must present an imminent risk to others. It’s not just about the fugitive but also your safety and others at the hostel.
AmItheAsshole,f0tniq4,t3_d6js39,1568925467.0,"YTA I’m sorry about your accident but it seems like it was last minute when they had to get to class, I understand that it’s an inconvenience for you but it’s really petty."
AmItheAsshole,f0tna8s,t3_d6jt66,1568925334.0,NTA get a sign or a fence. It’s your property and they’re TA for sure.
AmItheAsshole,f0tn5ho,t3_d6juw5,1568925262.0,NTA ignoring you and not paying you back while clearly trying to take advantage is a sign of a shitty friend. Definitely dump him. The eighty dollars isn’t huge but the red flags are
AmItheAsshole,f0tmq3g,t3_d6c0g0,1568925035.0,NTA it’s your money to do with what you wish. The things you’re paying off for your daughter were mostly out of her control. And from what you’ve said she seems smart with money (eg not taking on excessive loans and saving up for eye surgery) so helping her as her parent is reasonable. Your son made his life choices and you’re right they’re his kids to provide for.
AmItheAsshole,f0tmbj3,t3_d6cpjt,1568924814.0,YTA while boyfriend seems like a dick unless it’s explicitly stated in your lease then you’re just one of those militant vegans that everyone hates. Grow up
