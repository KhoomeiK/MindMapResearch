Adult son broke into his parents house and bludgeoned his mom and dead in the head with an axe like 30 times and left thinking they were both dead. Most of the dad’s brain was destroyed and he was basically dead but the part of his brain that is responsible for doing routine activities was still intact. So with his head bashed in and him being basically unrecognizable he unknowingly stood up from bed, walked downstairs and out the door to grab the paper from the street, walked back inside the house, and made himself a bowl of cereal all before dropping dead.

or saw something and I’d think she was nuts. This was up until a few months ago.

I once was in the kitchen and she was in another room. I thought I heard her come into the family room right outside the kitchen and I swear I heard her talking to me. I moved my head so I could see into the room and semi shouted “what?” And she wasn’t in there. I asked her a little later and she told me she had been in our room the whole time. 

About a week after this I was taking a shower and my wife and I have a pretty open door no need for privacy household. So I heard her walk in to the bathroom and shut the door and say something to me so distinctly so I pulled the shower curtain and said “what?” And she was gone. She hadn’t even come into the bathroom. 

The weirdest part is that I swear I heard her voice but could never make out the words. And I realized after that it didn’t really sound like her either. Weird stuff.
