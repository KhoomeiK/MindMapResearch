AskOldPeople,fr5x440,t3_gml13j,1589916124.0,"Yes. My sister and older brothers were beaten for really stupid things: being sarcastic, saying a ""bad"" word, not being respectful, and even for losing a fight. Yup. My dad beat the crap out of one of my brothers because he came home in torn-up clothes after having been beaten up by a neighbor boy. My brothers have told me they wouldn't have been raised any other way, but one of them treats their kids like shit and the other one tried to justify it and/or say it wasn't as bad as I remember it. My sister, who got beaten AND molested (with my mother's complete knowledge and unspoken approval) has never been able to lead a normal life. I wasn't beaten, but as the youngest I was told I couldn't do things and emotionally infantilized to such an extent that I had no idea how to just routinely take care of myself independently, like how to pay bills, how to save money, how to write a damned check. I had to get help from friends, and even people at my jobs for these things, and the way they'd look at me when they realized I didn't know these basic life skills was wholly embarrassing.

I never confided in my mother, never told her my feelings because I'd be told to shut up and stop being whiny, etc. She'd slap me if I got even a little snarky, so I kept it all in. Internalized resentment and anger, I later discovered, will bubble up to the surface and it won't be pretty for anyone. I had a lot of shit to work out. My sister's been in therapy on and off for decades and still can't function like a normal adult."

>I can't help but think that people enjoying lockdowns and quarantines are often very privileged. 

I'm not enjoying it, per se, and like I already said, I don't think most people are. However, my family currently subsist on one meager income: my disability payments. Normally, my family are wondering if we'll have to skip or be late on a bill payment. We wonder if we'll have to hit up the food bank to make what we have stretch until my next SSDI deposit. 

The pandemic has made our lives way easier. We got the stimulus payment. We got an increase in our food stamps. For the first time in months, my refrigerator and pantry are full to the brim. 

We normally have zero money for extras like movies, going out to eat, taking a Sunday drive to see friends. 

What you are experiencing right now is exactly what my family experience on a daily basis, and what thousands, perhaps millions of Americans experience every day.

I gave him a pet and felt bone. This poor old guy was on the brink of death from starvation, so I picked him up and took him home. That night he would only eat out of my hand, so I cradled him as he ate small tidbits at a time. 

I talked to a few people who speculated that he had been the companion of an old man who had died recently, so he had no home and no one missing him. 

He was around 10 at the time, and he lived with me for another 18 months before I had to send him over the Rainbow Bridge due to cancer. His name was Woodrow, because he was a bit curmudgeonly like the *Lonesome Dove* character and had a walk that reminded me of a cowboy after a long ride. His back had been damaged, so whenever you scratched him near the butt, instead of arching his back, it lowered.  

He was a softy with me, but didn't like my other cat.

TwoXChromosomes,fp54g6u,t1_fp5127y,1588315984.0,"Not OP but I'll give you my opinion. 

I understand where the phrase is coming from. It's from a place where the speaker is trying to say that they want to treat POC with respect and not like a lesser human being. 

That being said, if one says that phrase too often, it can seem as though they are negating the struggles that African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, etc., have endured at the hands of White/European/Americans. So, it's a double-edged sword. 

No one is without bias. I'm biased. I was raised by a mother who whispered the words ""black"" and ""Hispanic"" when discussing POC. We had black neighbors who loved having a good time. She would sit at the window in our kitchen and ""tsk, tsk"" about the noise (it wasn't that loud) and got scandalized when one of the neighbor's brothers married a white woman. 

Every day for me it's a struggle. I do my best to not judge people by appearances, but when you're raised by people with racist tendencies, it's easy to just go with what you grew up with instead of trying to improve.
