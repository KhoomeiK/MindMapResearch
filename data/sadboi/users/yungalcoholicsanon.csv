My best advice for inspiration from personal experience is try to sit with your thoughts more often. Maybe even try some meditation if you don‚Äôt already, it‚Äôs one way you can build a habit of observing your thoughts. Maybe just sit/lay down in a quiet room for awhile and see what pops through your head‚Äîdon‚Äôt try and force anything. Anyway, have fun with it and don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself if nothing comes up."

Everyone has their own path and things can change a lot in a relatively short amount of time. Whenever I have those thoughts I try my best to either ignore them or counter them. They do not help me make any progress so even if those thoughts were true the best thing to do would still be ignore them and to do small things to work on yourself day by day.
