PrequelMemes,foowvfp,t1_foodzvc,1587948167.0,"So now you‚Äôre saying her lifting those rocks comes down to her believing in herself? Get the fuck outta here dude. Luke fucking Skywalker had to work his ass off to do that and Rey can do it because she ‚Äúbelieves in herself‚Äù?? I can‚Äôt believe you even typed that. Luke had bags of self confidence.

PrequelMemes,fonv1if,t1_fonuid6,1587927015.0,"But the idea of being a dyad is 10x more ‚Äúforced and lazy‚Äù because it‚Äôs a means to an end.

Not to mention they only mention the whole dyad thing in the last movie of the trilogy, as if they just wrote it in to explain their nonsensical writing of the previous films.
