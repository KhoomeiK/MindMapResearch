BPD,exs929q,t3_cu077z,1566536252.0,"Absolutely! I think I‚Äôve broken up with my boyfriend about 20+ times now in a two year relationship. We‚Äôre still together currently, it‚Äôs just that every time we fight I catastrophize that this will always be like this and I can‚Äôt be in a relationship with someone who causes me that much pain therefore I must end it. 

It‚Äôs so frustrating knowing that emotionally this is how I feel, yet logically knowing that I don‚Äôt want to break up with him and this is the bpd side of me talking. Unfortunately the cycle creates a ton of instability for us both in our relationship which then tends to lead to more fights and the cycle repeats itself. 

Would love to hear anyone‚Äôs thoughts on how to stop this :/"

To me it feels like they‚Äôre just doing it to ‚Äúcheck a box‚Äù or get it over with so we can move on, not to truly apologize because they mean it.  :/"
