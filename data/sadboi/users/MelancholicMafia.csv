I always tell people who ask that Schizophrenia is such a lonely disease

I mean, yeah, there’s the hallucinations and delusions of being watched but...

It’s so unlike what most people have experienced or are experiencing that it’s hard to relate to others sometimes

“You’re doing so well!” Is nice to hear but hearing stuff like that and how”mysterious” I am or how “they never know what I’m gonna do next” SEEMS complimentary but just fuels how isolated I feel from everyone else in my life

Ugh, I just needed to rant.  I wish people would bother to try to understand"

bestoflegaladvice,esui8ug,t1_esufewy,1562283871.0,"And I’d argue this mentality is why many people who go on to abuse can justify their “pre-abuse” behavior

Yes, many abusers are ABSOLUTELY aware they are abusing their partners and hide behind being completely unaware their behavior was bad, while being knowing what they did was wrong and reveling in it

But some abusers aren’t like that.  They get as far as they do because they don’t revel in hurting people.  They’re “nice people” who “had a bad day” and that “bad day” turns into a bad week, a bad month and so on

Some abusers genuinely aren’t aware what they’re doing is abusive.  That’s part of why they’re so dangerous.  Same with manipulative people- some genuinely don’t realize their behavior is wrong and feel genuinely victimized when it’s called out

It’s a scary world, and it’s a dangerous thing to put dangerous people into a neat little box where all their behaviors and motivations are consistent"

But I’ve also been in scenarios where people try to ‘subtly’ tell if you’re ‘one of them’.  And that feels super discouraging, especially if you’re new and in a hobby that doesn’t seem (whether it’s true or not) to have a lot of women.  I find these experiences are all in the past now (I think the fact that people started to recognize this form of gatekeeping led other guys to call their douchebag friends out, because it’s usually just That Guy), but I’m pretty sure it’ll come up in the future.

terriblefandommemes,eooi7oh,t1_eooh8wq,1558739179.0,"Professional musicians are in it to make money.  That’s not a criticism, that’s a fact.  Most love what they do but you gotta pay the bills, yknow?  I work in an art field and while I love what I do at the end of the day I go to the extent of what I do (IE I spend a lot of time, effort, and money in my field) because I can make a living off of it

Is everyone in music there to make art? Nah, but that’s been a thing as long as making money off of art has been a thing.  Many make entertainment for entertainment’s sake - and this is often what makes money.

People who enjoy media that’s not there to be creative or make a statement are just as valid as people who only listen to underground stuff that’s about philosophy and “worthwhile” topics.  Art is an individual experience and I argue that trying to put qualifications on what’s worthwhile and what’s not is not only pointless but ultimately detrimental because gatekeeping art has never gotten anyone anywhere.

It’s one thing if it’s not something you personally enjoy or consider art but in the end it’s not really up to you to make that decision for other people.  Though maybe you weren’t and I misinterpreted what you were saying.  Who knows, man, it’s music, let’s just listen to what we like"
terriblefandommemes,eoofxkc,t1_eood17l,1558737557.0,"Man, every single type of published music serves to make money.  As others have pointed out, Pop is just popular music, and shit like the Beatles and even Nirvana fit in that category.

When I was younger I needlessly criticized pop music because I thought it made me stand out from the crowd.  Now I just recognize it made me unbearable to talk to sometimes

Not all of it is great but like.... no such thing as a genre that’s all good or all bad."

notliketheothergirls,eoecdsv,t1_eoebrbe,1558493026.0,"Agree, definitely.  Context is what matters most.

That’s why I would urge men to not use such a phrase willy-nilly - most women associate it with men of ill-repute, evidenced by the picture posted by the OP.  Sometimes guys say things with the purest of intentions and they simply don’t understand when women perceive that different because they have not had to grow up in a world that teaches them to be suspicious because if they are assaulted it is their fault for not being cautious enough.  We, as women, are taught from a young age to fear men, unfortunately.

Sometimes phrases and words get lost in the gender gap.  That’s why I say it should not b a indictment of character but it will always give me pause - I have had very little positive experiences with men who have said similar sentiments to me (though I understand that because I am a lesbian I do not have the same experiences as straight women).

To end it on a light note- the one time it had been positive was when a friend of mine was trying to describe me as “butch” but didn’t have the words for it.  He was very flustered and funny.  Love that guy."
notliketheothergirls,eoean4a,t1_eodo39t,1558491918.0,"In all honesty, while I think nothing should be a strict indictment of one’s character, if a guy says to me “you’re not like other girls” it definitely will make me pause

You gotta ask- what does he consider the “typical girl” to be like?  And how are you different?

It’s not an immediate “red flag” but it should definitely make you pause.  I’ve had men in the past tell me I “wasn’t like other girls” and it turned out in 99% of the cases that I wasn’t like the other girls because they had a sexist view of what girls should be: shallow, petty, gossiping layabouts who didn’t have the emotional connection with each other that they knew men did.  Some of these guys I was able to talk it out with but those who refused to listen I dropped."
