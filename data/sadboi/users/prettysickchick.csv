beautyblogs,f82odzm,t1_f82k6uf,1574195115.0,"I'd see a dermatologist if possible, or even your primary care physician; I can't be sure obviously, but it could very well be fungal acne which is different from your run of the mill overactive sebaceous gland or hormonal acne. S/he will be able to prescribe something to clear it right up. Meanwhile, try cutting out using all oils on your skin and see if that eases it. Also try using OTC fungal treatments, and a mild Salicylic Acid treatment. 
Good luck!!"

Keep in mind, it took years of daily medication before I could get to this point - but it works for me right now. Everyone's different, and it depends on the severity, frequency, duration, and type of psychosis you personally deal with.

But, I expect to always need to have the meds onhand."
BeforeNAfterAdoption,f7eazcv,t3_dvryne,1573652713.0,"Esmeralda was living in a colony of 30 or so cats when she was rescued - but wasn’t taking to foster care at all. She was quite underweight from refusing to eat, and because of a severe eye infection, could only partially open one eye all the way.  
The foster lady, who had about 20 other cats and was basically a small in-home shelter, told me she was thinking of relinquishing her back to the hoarders who had her before because she was getting sicker and sicker from refusing to eat. 
She didn’t really like people much either, and the foster woman was at a loss.  

I had just lost my little Familiar Fritz to a rare autoimmune illness, and I and my other kitty Calvin were heartbroken - Calvin was refusing to eat or play, so things were no fun at home; I wasn’t at all ready to adopt as it had only been days since Fritz’s death. But, I knew my Calvin, who is a big, sweet Maine Coon - he needed another friend to bring him out of his grief - and the idea of that poor little girl being put back where there were sick, infected, starving cats that these people couldn’t afford to feed or take to the vet was too much for me. 

When I saw this little girl in person, I immediately fell in love.  She was a tiny little ball of attitude, sick as she was, and had a meow that sounded like Phyllis Diller! She let me hold her for a moment, with fear and hope in her little face (or so it seemed to me), and that was it.
I knew I had to take her home and show her she could feel safe. 
The evening I took her home, she ate for the first time in days! 

Calvin immediately brought her his favorite toy, and it was obviously love at first sight. 
She needed lots of medication at first to nurse her back to health, and she’s definitely a fighter. Now, her right eye opens all the way, she’s gained two pounds, and is such a love bug. She asks for tummy rubs from me, and went from a cat that hated to be touched to a girl who begs to be picked up. 
We love Esmeralda like crazy - and she still sounds like Phyllis Diller."

schizoaffective,f74rw3a,t1_f74o5od,1573407103.0,"Honestly, I do have to fight that slippery downward slope as well. Being on an antidepressant helps in that vein, for me - and I actually do make an effort to go out and socialize, once a week. 

I think this, more than anything, has helped me keep that balance as the interaction sort of forces me to reassess my rather dim view of humanity, ha ha. Because it forces me to realize there are good people out there, or at least tolerably so.

Plus, seeing that others are pleased to see me keeps me from getting too bitter. And with my improved boundaries I find it much less draining  - I don't worry about being taken advantage of or getting into inappropriate relationships etc.

I dunno, that's me but it's something to consider.

I literally just now made a new post on the blog about self-care when I’m dealing with my own mental illness; the main thing that helps me is making myself adhere to a schedule with skincare, bathing, etc.  It sort of tricks my brain into seeing it as something I MUST do - while keeping it as basic, pleasurable, and easy as possible.
Just having some consistency in what you use and doing it at a set time daily can help your skin and hair in the immediate future - I saw a lot of improvement just doing simple stuff every day (or nearly, anyway). 

The derm will help a lot , too, as it gives you some answers, solutions, and direction!   

And d try Niacinamide, if your skin is tolerating it - it took some time, but my pores are so much better, and breakouts happen but are really rare.  It seems to help most people this way, unless they are allergic to it.

The best way to tell what your skin type is generally right after cleansing: using a gentle cleanser like a milky type, how does your skin feel? is it tight and dry? Do you notice a lot of flaking, and other signs of dryness? 
If your skin is uncomfortable and tight with no show of natural oil/shininess, your likely dry.
If you wash your face and wait 10 minutes without applying any product, how soon do you start to show oil? If within 10 or so minutes you are shiny all over, you have oily skin. 
Combo skin shows some oiliness in the T-zone but dryness on the cheeks. 
Dehydrated skin isn't a type but a condition. All types can experience acne, for different reasons - obviously oily skin is susceptible, but dehydrated skin will try to overproduce oil to balance itself out, which can lead to breakouts. 
Then there are the different types of acne - fungal, allergic, sebum overproduction...
It's of course advisable to see a dermatologist to figure out which kind you have if it's persistent! 
I hope this helps some ..

I've had issues with posting my own blog on subreddits as it's considered self-promotion 😒. However, I'm so happy you found the advice helpful! Picking is a real bitch to get under control - I did it for many years and my skin was just a wreck. I suspect it's a problem for many of us of the Brain Cootie Tribe."

Thank you so very much for the kind words - I would love for more Spoonies to find me, it would be great to have some more interaction with people who understand what it's like to be living with this crap! 
My next post is going to talk about meds, depression/mania and self care. 
Hope to see you around 🤗🤗"

I have seen a big difference in my skin since adding it to my routine, and it’s fine to use in conjunction with the tret -  I use it twice daily and after about a month I could really start to see some changes."

SkincareAddiction,f5x21mh,t3_dpoes3,1572534194.0,"I don’t shop on BB generally, but some ingredients to look for in your skincare right off the bat to help with toning up your pores, texture,  managing oiliness, and keeping skin hydrated without exacerbating breakouts or sebum production would be:
- Niacinamide 
- Propolis
- Madecassic Acid/Centella Asiatica 
- Hyaluronic Acid
These can all be found in serums, creams, and toners. 

Look for hydrating toners as opposed to astringent ones, and if you’re super oily, stick with water-based moisturizer like Laneige Water Bank, Tatcha Water Cream, Belif Aqua Bomb, etc.   
Brands I personally like for oilier skin, if you can get them:  Deciem (The Ordinary, Hylamide, etc), CosRx, Neogen, Versed, and Stratia. 
Hope this helps a little..."

beautyblogs,f5uv52k,t1_f5ug80k,1572479831.0,"Everyone is different, certainly - and things like age/baseline skin condition/diet can all have an impact . From what I’ve been hearing from some of my readers when they write, you’re lucky! I know my meds have definitely had an impact on my skin, but adderall is not a med I personally take. 
When I wrote this series, it was in response to a request from an adderall user who said she and many people she knows who are part of a group here on Reddit experience a lot of skin issues due to the drug - so I did my due diligence, did some research, and found that it’s fairly common.  I’m glad it’s a thing you don’t have to deal with!"
beautyblogs,f5uu2rk,t1_f5t7c9y,1572479358.0,"Wow, thanks! A compliment from a fellow science geek is a true compliment indeed!  
Actually, the only really objectionable thing I find in the Pixi Glow Tonic is the fragrance - there are some pretty good things in there, otherwise. I love the Panax Ginseng, Witch Hazel is a great anti-inflammatory, Aloe and Glycerin are fantastic for hydration...it’s actually a pretty good product overall.   The Ordinary Glycolic will be a lot stronger, and definitely isn’t formulated for daily use - it doesn’t have all the buffers that the Pixi one has and you’ll risk damaging your barrier. I only use mine a couple times a week at the most - usually once does it for me - and use my hydrating toners every day (also after using the TO Glycolic).  
I hope that helps!"

I didn’t get any of the “ouch” due to the formulation, and your skin will acclimate quickly enough - at that price point, it’s no biggie if you need to move up to a stronger percentage."

I also use tret, and have dry/dehydrated skin that overproduces oil on the nose and just a bit on the forehead in summer months, so we probably benefit from the same kinds of products. 
Definitely try the hyaluronic as a cleanser! HA is really not meant to moisturize, but to hydrate, I.e, draw water to the skin. Moisturizer adds emollients, then locks in the water and adds in the cholesterols and Ceramides and fats, etc that we need.  I have a love/hate relationship with the stuff, lol, as I dig what it does in theory,  but I think there are things out there that might do it better...

I’ll keep up the writing, hope it continues to be helpful!"
SkincareAddiction,f4prxgi,t3_dl7ca6,1571741462.0,"Ugh. There are a couple (literally, two) of SR products I really like, and I seriously just recommended them in a post which annoys me bc this sort of thing is so galling - more honestly to me bc of how shittily she treated her employees. 
Well, OK, the scam pisses me off pretty badly as well.
But, as many people have mentioned before me, I’m sure this is far more common than we’d like to think about. 
Lately, honestly, in light of the Drunk Elephant & Sunday Riley nonsense, and the insane Sephora prices, and prices of skincare and cosmetics in general, I’m really just getting bored with huge beauty companies as a whole.  I just ordered an eye balm from a tiny natural skincare company in Australia, which is taking over a week to get here, but it was cheaper than buying it here (Credo carries it but the markup was like 50% 🙄).  
All of this crap just inspires me to look at smaller companies that I can’t find at Sephora, or on Influenster, because in any case, no matter where I choose to put my money, I can look at the ingredients and at least make an educated guess as to whether it’s going to work for me or not.  I use a moisturizer from a smaller indie company (not overseas, lol) that works great - I know the ingredients, it’s fragrance free, has all the ceramides/cholesterol/fatty acids I want, and it’s not stupid expensive.  
I suspect more people will start looking outside big cosmetic companies if they get fed up enough, if they understand other options are available to them - when it comes down to it, we talk with our $$$, and it’s ultimately up to us where we choose to spend it."
SkincareAddiction,f4ppowb,t1_f4ot27s,1571740047.0,"The Ordinary has several options, I’d check out the Deciem website to see their different offerings - if you need strong, I’d start there.

beautyblogs,f4gkguy,t1_f4b9qyt,1571581963.0,"My skin is EXTREMELY sensitive, due to being on lots of meds that jack up my barrier and make my oil production wonky, to boot. My forehead and nose get oily AF, especially in the summer months, and then very very dry on the rest of my face. Thus far, i've had no problems with my skin getting oilier from this in my problem areas, due to the Rice Bran Extract, which helps to regulate, as well as soak up excess sebum, and the Camillia oil, which is almost a dry oil. The Jojoba is nearly a skin identical oil as well, which means it will soak in quickly, and not sit on top of your face.  
However, the Avocado oil is a thicker, more emollient oil meant for drier skins. In my opinion, though, the drier ingriedients balance it out, making it suitable for all skins except the very oiliest. If you have VERY oily skin, like you're shiny 15-30 minutes after cleansing and have a lot of trouble with blackheads and closed comedones, you might want to try something that isn't going to make you feel more oily.  I hope this helps!"
