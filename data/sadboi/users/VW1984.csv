You have to think about yourself too, you broke up for a reason. Whatever reasons behind his absence or ghosting, it has nothing to do with you. It seems hard at first but trust me you’ll find your peace, I am still battling with guilt, sadness, and wonder if he ever liked me ... I can relate to you 100% but I know this is just illogical thinking and it doesn’t really matter at the end of the day. It was his choice to walk away and you will just need to focus on yourself and get on with it.

We connected so well prior to meeting (we met online) and it was the weirdest thing ever.

We have both been hurt in the past but we have so much trust in each other. 

I miss him every day and the thought of him not presence is eating me alive. Don't get my wrong, I am this type of person walking away from emotions or past relationships without a blink in my eye, but with my twin flame it was completely different.

Just thought to share my story to you - met this wonderful guy couple of months ago, fell for him but several weeks ago he stop texting me like how it used to be, I was very concerned and confused back then. A week after his first episode he reached out and we met up, he explained that it was his depression (I knew he had anxiety but was not aware of his depression) and I told him it was alright, I will try to be patient with him, then he withdraw again, this time I was more prepared for it.

Fast forward to another week he reached out to me again and we met, he told me that he feels like he is wasting my time and can't give me what I want because how could he be serious in a relationship when he couldn't even look after himself. Besides, he does not know if his depression is even going to go away (bear in mind he took days off work because of his depression). I reassured him that I want him to take care of himself first, hugged him and kissed him and I truly meant it.

I am not going to lie that this is very hard on me too, because I simply care about him. I do feel lonely from time to time and ofc I want to see him more and be with him regardless if he is feeling down, but I will respect him and give him space if need be. I think it was a dick move from the girl you met to just walk away like that without giving you any explanation, but I do understand being with a depressed partner requires a lot of patient, empathy, and love, maybe she just doesn't have any quality like that.

There are people who will give you support and don't judge/belittled you, or even try to help you out by doing whatever they can. Maybe it won't be many people like that out there but it doesn't mean you are not going to find someone like that, keep trying though, never give up hope. I truly wish you find someone that you can trust some days.

Best of luck x"

relationshipanxiety,fajlnw3,t3_e9cpkm,1576144178.0,"Hello OP,

I am sorry that you are going through this, it must be really hard and can imagine how hurtful was to experience a cold shoulder when physically/mentally unwell. However, I also understand that dealing with partners with mental or physical illness could be super stressful - maybe he had a really bad day too? 

In regards with prioritising his needs above yours - I tend to do the same when I am with someone, simply because I care for the person I am with and often ended up with resentment if I don't get the same in respond, is it anyone's fault? not really, but that is why it is so important to be honest with your partner about how you feel, you have your own needs too. If you've got more shit to do in the morning then you would need to tell him and try find am middle ground that satisfies both your needs. No one can read your mind, so speak up a little to him.

I think though, it is pretty shitty that he doesn't try understand your issue or why you are acting in certain ways. Like the reason why I am here is because the person I am seeing has anxiety and depression but I don't, so in order for me to be empathetic, I need to understand the illness. If I were you, I would speak to him about the illness and tryna give him in-depth explanations on better days. He might not know how to response to you when you couldn't eat, he might not know how to make you feel better, he might not know where to find more information about this illness so you need to tell him. If he truly cares about you, he would take it seriously, perhaps, help you dealing with it the next time. 

It is hard for both parties but if anyone wants to make it work, it has to come on both sides. Good luck OP"
relationshipanxiety,fa9swjq,t3_e880oc,1575890230.0,"Hey Op, I can so relate to both sides so guess I am sharing and hopefully to give you some confidence- I don't have anxiety disorder (maybe a bit insecure in relationship), the person I am seeing does. However, I get anxious when he doesn't answer to my text, say, in 12 hours. It is very hard to not overthink since there is a sign of change in behaviours and that triggers my anxiety because I started to wonder if I have done something wrong or if he was going to leave me or worst case, just vanish in my world. This is totally normal, even to a person who does not have an anxiety disorder, everybody worries about something, the differences here are how we respond to it. My suggestion is try to have faith in him because he might be the person who might be able to break through/free and do things differently. Things doesn't have to go as they have gone before.

Regarding to having the conversation with him, I guess is to find the courage to open up, I understand it is very scary to show vulnerability, or even having to think that he might find you hard to deal with, but you need to give him a chance to get to know you. If he doesn't know how you feel/think, he might say or act in some ways that you find hurtful because you have never explained to him what you need from him. Also, what you don't want is to keep continuing seeing him and develop feelings only to find him not the right guy. On the lighter note, judging from what you have written, this guy has made efforts to call you twice a day though his busy schedule, I think he likes you, try to believe that.

The guy I am seeing went extremely quiet in the past week and I haven't seen him since, though he did explain that he is in a bad place. Guess the only thing I could do is to wait for him to open up, he was clear about his anxiety since day 1 but the truth is, I am anxious as hell of not knowing what he is going through because I care about him, but I am willing to give him time and space until he is comfortable or feels better. I wish he would have open up, be honest, because I would never judge him from that. So this might be what your guy are thinking when you have a breakdown because you never share how you feel to him.

Maybe say something like, hey, I really like you and things are going good, but it scares me because being vulnerable is hard for me. I get a bit anxious when you don't text me in hours because I fear that I have done something wrong and you are just going to walk away from me. Although I don't even want to think of you in that way, I cannot control my thoughts sometimes. So even a small text to let me know everything is fine would be great, I understand that you are busy and might not be able to accommodate my needs all the time, which is fine to me, but  maybe just a text to let me know you are busy would help me not to overthink.

I think if he is the right guy he would understand this, this isn't too much to ask for imo, relationships are hard and go both ways, if he is unwilling to find the middle ground  or give you explanation of his behaviours then it is better to know from early days than later.

Good luck OP"

relationshipanxiety,fa9qunv,t3_e849ym,1575887090.0,"Hey OP, just letting you know that I am very sorry to hear what you have been going through, I can imagine it being so hard. I think you should be more selfish because none of the issues were caused by you, if anything, you could not be more patient and strong for your boyfriend. It seems your relationship with your boyfriend is unhealthy and seems like a limbo, trust me, you don't want to be in this for another 5 years because it would be exhausting and everyone has a limit. I get that he is your first serious relationship and you love him, it is also hard to see clearly when you are in the situation, but try to look at the bigger picture, do you want to be unhappy for another 5 years or do you want a clean cut, cry your eyes our for couple of months, but allow yourself some time to heal and eventually find your own happiness? I think you knew the answer from the bottom of your heart, you just need to take action on it. 

My suggestions seems brutal at first, but try delete his number, go on no contact, allow yourself some time away from him. I wish you good luck on everything and that finding your happiness sooner or later."

Thank you :-) 

I hope she'll be ready at some point this weekend and I will let her know the above message. I am not a person with patience normally but I'd try learn for her. Wish you luck Oxymoronic23 too!"

And made an outcaste or punching bag for the man box. The things we need to manage our anxiety healthily are also denied us. Things like a supporting community, platonic physical affection, and positive emotional outlets. You are

Don't give up, the person I am seeing is undergoing the same struggle, if you explain and let the person in then I guarantee you someone will love you the way you are"
Anxiety,f9ql6mb,t1_f9qevsy,1575562971.0,"No I get it - but the person I have been seeing for a while was clear about having anxiety since day 1, hasn't scared me away at the slightest! Just I didn't have any clue and now reading a lot of articles trying to understand it better. Sometimes I can't really explain  but when the right person comes along they'd put up to it 100%, for those women didn't stick around -  better off than wasting your time for months then piss off when you start developing strong feelings, this is just my personal opinion though, best of luck for people dealing with anxiety!"

I am not trying to 'change' or 'save' her because only she can, but I will be there for her. I have never be with anyone who has anxiety but I am surprised what 'love' makes us, it is indeed beautiful. I presumed you felt the same way as my girl does, but trust me, if someone likes you they'd sticked around so don't run or push people way - they might surprise you! Best of luck to you Wendy"
Anxiety,f9q5i2f,t1_f9nvmxx,1575555530.0,"Yeah she contacted me finally saying that to give her some time on her own, and will eventually meet later when she sorts herself out. Still don't know what happened to her but I guess this is why I am here trying to get some insights. I hope none of her anxiety issues are caused by me because I like her so much and would do a lot for her ... 

I will make sure to let her know that her anxiety does not scared me the slightest and I will be in this with her, just kind of worried that she might push me away because being vulnerable and to let someone in is pretty scary. Do you think telling her that will pressure her more or is it actually a good thing to say?

I guess from what you were saying is not to ask too many questions on bad days and try speak about it on good days, thank you for that advise though! I will make sure to be very patient."
Anxiety,f9n62nw,t1_f9n4p6g,1575477791.0,">s to know that its not your fault, its hard managing anxiety especially when you know it affects the ones around you. So you just preffer to be alone. Or at least this is how I feel. Its really really hard, trust me

Thank you for taking your time to write to me - I can't relate as I don't have severe anxiety but I want to support her fully, I will be patient and give her all the time she needs. I am reading a lot of articles and posts so I know what to say and what not. 

I want to go through this journey with her, and will reassure that I will not just walk away ... I guess I need to gain her trust first so she could rely on me :) Wish you all the best on managing anxiety"

Anxiety,f9mqsyc,t1_f9mp13m,1575468079.0,"> being asked lots of questions that she can't answer. She may be worried about burdening you or feel that she needs to deal with her shit on her own. She may just not be able to handle being around people right now.

Thank you so much for your advise, I guess I feel insecure from her disappearing out of the blue, making me wonder if I have done anything wrong or maybe I am not good enough for her, everyone has their own little issue I guess!

I had texted her several times to let her know I am always there for her - she hasn't read my message but I guess I can only wait now. I will speak to her when she is ready and will definitely let her know that I am serious about us and will NEVER judge or belittle her. 

I hope she will contact me soon :) Again, thank you for taking time to write me the message, it has calmed me down"
