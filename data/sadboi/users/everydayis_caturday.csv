fuckeatingdisorders,fqns1gl,t3_gjtu60,1589500325.0,"I am going through the exact same thing right now. The one thing that I find helps is just putting something (even one bite or two) at that first intake. Your body doesn’t know or recognize hunger cues right now, but by putting that little bite or two will start your digestive tract up for the day. My biggest fear is the same as yours, if I start I’ll open the floodgates, but just having a bite or two isn’t as scary as the whole meal, and helps me to break it down into manageable bits."

EatingDisorders,fn36m0n,t3_fypjqd,1586614124.0,"I’m just starting the recovery journey and my doctor said something that really struck my partner and I. My doctor told us in my last appointment, that it is not his job to make sure I eat, eat more, or don’t eat, his job is to support me through meals, and support me emotionally since there is so much emotion in relation to food. As soon as my partner became my cheerleader on the sidelines, completely judgement free, he was there to support my meal time or help me prepare food when it’s just too hard for me. It’s made talking about the issues easier and more like we are battling  it together rather than alone"

zoloft,fgphcir,t3_ezsn6s,1581004811.0,"It totally depends on the person, but I personally found seroquel to be a better pair for me with Zoloft vs Trazodone.

Seroquel is an atypical antipsychotic that when she’s in different doses can be a mood stabilizer, anti anxiety and a sleep aid. 

If the combo is affecting your quality of life it may be worth mentioning to your doctor so they can look at what options and other combinations may work for you!"

bulimia,f5jq9q7,t3_do378c,1572236422.0,There’s a series called diagnosed on Netflix and what you’re describing reminds me of episode 5 about a girl named Lashay - she ended up having Rumination syndrome.
AnorexiaNervosa,f5e0fa9,t3_dnfw95,1572162686.0,"I have this too, it’s called Raynaud’s, fancy name for a circulatory deficiency. The blood vessels contract too quickly when exposed to cooling temperatures in the hands and feet (symptoms not normally seen since we wear socks/shoes)There is no cure for it other than stay hydrated and bring gloves with you wherever you go, even if you’re the weird one with gloves in 30°C weather lol
On a serious note though, if you are a smoker it is very common to see big improvement of symptoms within 3-6 months of quitting!"
