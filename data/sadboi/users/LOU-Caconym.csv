Ahahaha. That's like saying a tiger is the same as a house cat. Gators are downright snuggly by comparison.  
Our venomous snakes are elapids, their venom neurotoxic. Of the world's top ten most venomous snakes, Australia has ten of them.  
We don't have large land predators like the rest of the world, but we have a stunning array of animals that are dangerous enough to pose serious risk to life. The blue-ringed octopus is the size of a ping-pong ball, and will paralyse you so you're conscious but can't will your lungs to breathe.   


So a lot of our dangerous animals are more dangerous than their overseas counterparts. The thing though is how different the ""rules"" are in Australia. Rules every Aussie grows up knowing. All snakes are capable of killing you unless you can make a positive ID as a python or other non-dangerous species (I had a heart attack when an American friend told me about her mother playing with a wild snake she had no ID for). Some spiders will ruin your day, but large huntsmen are friendly exterminators of pest bugs (Peppa Pig had an episode showing spiders as friends which was pulled for Australian audiences). You don't swim where Salties live. And a thousand other bits of knowledge we barely even know that we know, but that may not be immediately obvious to a foreigner.
