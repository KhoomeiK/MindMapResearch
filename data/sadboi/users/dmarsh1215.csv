Methadone,fph50ez,t3_gdaki3,1588615073.0,You should have turned right back around and showed your clinic
suboxone,fph4pfa,t1_fph1dwf,1588614922.0,"Your experiencing major depression, probably because your brain is used to full agonist opiates and sub is only a partial so itâ€™s kind of like being the thirstiest your brain has ever been and someone handing you a big full glass of ice water but your only allowed to drink half of it... just like when your on nothing you experience paws and depression your brain is trying to find itâ€™s new normal. I would suggest staying on it and getting a COMBO of therapy and medication for depression"
suboxone,fo8cqlo,t3_g2kt28,1587594074.0,"Oh Iâ€™m not sure enjoy if the pills will work that way, maybe you could make a post asking that. Iâ€™m so happy I switched and got away from methadone.. at random times Iâ€™ll get body pain but a bc powder fixes that. I noticed I felt like total shit at higher dosage so Iâ€™m just talking about 10mg a day right now and for whatever reason taking about 2mg at night gross me sleep but if I take a larger dose Iâ€™ll toss and turn all night. Could you get the strips maybe? I really hope this works out for you"
suboxone,fo8920y,t3_g48oys,1587592109.0,If your serious I think itâ€™s a neurological problem... or a crazy side effect from a medication or your literally delirious from the insomnia and not sleeping

suboxone,fo87x70,t1_fnse385,1587591515.0,How are you doing now? I feel much better.. have you tried dissolving the strips bucally instead of under the tongue? That made a big difference for me.. also i found that if I took like a tiny dose like 1 to 2 mg before bed it actually worked better than me taking a big dose Before bed
suboxone,fo3khsf,t3_g4zprf,1587488417.0,Wow this made me happy cry. Good for you for knowing what needed to be done. I had a baby last year on methadone and although no ideal I had a good medical team and no one judged me. My baby did have very minor withdrawals but nothing like what Iâ€™ve heard can happen... I just switched to sub from methadone last week... one of the hardest things Iâ€™ve ever went through but so happy to be off methadone
suboxone,fo3fds8,t1_fo3agxn,1587485962.0,I was contacted the next day after doing the paperwork
suboxone,fnvbnp5,t3_fzm8nw,1587287219.0,"I have ringing in ears and headaches, it started when I started the subs... could be because Iâ€™m taking too much but I just started 5 days ago so still trying to get stable"

suboxone,fnmwnk6,t1_fnmosr2,1587079602.0,"Just curious, how long have you been on it. I canâ€™t wait to get stable and see all the positive affects. But the main reason I decided to switch is because the last year of me using methadone I was taking really slow but still enough to notice and I started double dosing and would run out 2 days early .. I was up to two weeks of takehomes so I couldnâ€™t use anything else those days. With a one year old that was torture. It just wasnâ€™t working for me anymore and I hated the person and mom I was. How long until you felt normal after switching from methadone?"
suboxone,fnmw5f5,t1_fnm9lf5,1587079321.0,"Yes, this. I canâ€™t tell either"
gabapentin,fnmu9bi,t3_g24ikm,1587078272.0,PLEASE be careful. I wish I would have never started gabapentin.. now every time I try to stop it feels a lot like opiate withdrawalâ€™s
suboxone,fnmttxg,t3_g2mees,1587078041.0,Wow Iâ€™m going through this exactly.. maybe. Not sure cause Iâ€™m only like 4 days in switching from methadone. But Iâ€™m having goosebumps and always cold
suboxone,fnmo44m,t1_fnm2vef,1587074962.0,Same... I couldnâ€™t imagine going cold turkey off methadone I probably only experienced just half of it.
suboxone,fnhuwm3,t3_g1kul3,1586969259.0,So the subs didnâ€™t cover up the methadone withdrawals for that long?
suboxone,fnhcd3t,t1_fngggkj,1586959674.0,Like you felt actual withdrawal for months?? ðŸ˜¢

suboxone,fng6vmn,t1_fng1p86,1586923775.0,Oh really? I actually might be because I have trouble with it under my tongue.. is that cheek?
suboxone,fnflkq8,t1_fnfk9bx,1586910467.0,Like do you really promise? I took 8 mg and didnâ€™t get worse but Iâ€™m still having severe leg pains itâ€™s so so bad. Will I entirely just wake up and take a dose of sub and it will just work like itâ€™s supposed to? This sucks thank you so much for the support. I just canâ€™t go on like this
suboxone,fnew3lp,t1_fneqlme,1586896950.0,"Well she just keeps saying I should be feeling something by now, if I had precipitated withdrawals will it keep happening or just that one time"
suboxone,fnelwxw,t1_fnel16x,1586891710.0,Am I stopped to keep redosing? And I have no access to a short term opiate will kratom work?
suboxone,fnekgfp,t1_fneg177,1586890970.0,No Iâ€™ve already took 2 6 mg doses hours apart and just nothing it doesnâ€™t help the a SEVERE RLS or body RLS itâ€™s like just not working.. why?

Methadone,fkv22nq,t3_fkuwde,1584560471.0,What really makes it bad is a ton of clinics arenâ€™t taking any new patients during this... so if you donâ€™t want to be sol find a clinic ASAP before itâ€™s too late

Methadone,fku8wnc,t1_fkr2lbq,1584544723.0,I feel like your down playing OPs success. Iâ€™m sorry I donâ€™t agree with how you went about that... what she did is awesome and very hard she was on it 3 years which is a good chunk of time and a heroin user for 10 years before... her experience was no walk in the park either Iâ€™m sure but she did it and sheâ€™s trying to give hope to others who feel stuck

Methadone,fkfuauy,t3_fi4soe,1584142704.0,I also felt sick after my dose but it ended up going away for me... your at such a high dose of methadone that I donâ€™t see you being able to taper low enough then switch without getting thrown into pwd. I would ask for wafer or pill form and see if that helps any
kratom,fhz2iad,t3_f2jv9s,1581989364.0,How are you feeling Iâ€™m wanting to jump off methadone also

Methadone,fg0zblj,t1_f3pudrp,1580417950.0,There is a way around it.. itâ€™s called the Bernese method. Just have to find a doctor willing to do it.
Methadone,fg0um0p,t1_fam696p,1580415337.0,What state is this dr in. Iâ€™m trying to switch to subs and this would be a dream to find a dr like this
Methadone,fg0tsfw,t1_ffvlvr4,1580414873.0,Iâ€™ve been on subs and they felt like methadone just without the excessive tiredness.. and so the other symptoms. Iâ€™m only on 65 mg so my dose isnâ€™t too high

Methadone,fg0qn9y,t1_fg0blez,1580413119.0,I get two weeks worth and do split dosing. But I will disagree with one thing.. Iâ€™m only on 65 mg and if Iâ€™m still two hours after taking my dose it will put me to sleep.. I hate it. Iâ€™m trying to switch to subs but we all know thatâ€™s a process... if I can find a dr to do the Bernese method on me Iâ€™m gonna do that.
Methadone,ffsmrd0,t1_ffr2iyz,1580185673.0,Not sure what I did to you... but there isnâ€™t more to the story. My counselor said thatâ€™s how this dr. Is. Why would I lie? I donâ€™t know any of yâ€™all I have nothing to gain. If I want to start tapering I have to go in six days per week.. only person making it hard here is yourself.
Methadone,ffsmflb,t1_ffrralu,1580185410.0,Yes thank you. That is my point exactly.
Methadone,ffsm2mo,t1_ffqeife,1580185128.0,What about the days I have to take it in front of them.. doesnâ€™t that just start me all over?

Methadone,f742fcx,t1_f72updv,1573397589.0,MethAdone in SOME people not all but some can cause abnormal heart rhythms. I forget the clinic name of it. If she has that she should be on sub. 230mg is an insane amount. And I donâ€™t think she would be nodding on just 50mg
birthcontrol,f1k6mhq,t3_d9ljvj,1569532376.0,Itâ€™s definitely not a myth I also lost all my baby weight after I gave birth and then six weeks later when I got Nexplanon I ended up gaining almost 25 pounds nothing fits me Iâ€™m miserable Iâ€™m depressed Iâ€™m anxious I cry all the time and it makes me sweat so much
