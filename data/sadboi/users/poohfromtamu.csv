how do you request an interview when you’re not ready??"
depression,fon0bda,t3_g876jr,1587909127.0,"similarly, when i messed up i would always think “okay that means no snack/lunch/dinner”. idk why i equated my work or performance with food, but if was a long struggle with reworking my mindset and constantly correcting myself. 

if i had a thought about food-like punishments, i would make myself eat and thinking why i thought nourishment was bad. it’s a process you have to continuous rework. 

while noticing you mind processes is a good step, now you have to actively work to change it because above all it’s a force of habit."

queer,fn0ycw9,t1_fn0v0pb,1586551152.0,"also adding on to this, i think it’s also important to make them aware that whatever gender they are, is not important. while self identity is a big thing to comes to terms w, overall i think we have to teach our kids that being a man or a woman isn’t the issue. 

the issue is society snd how they’ll be treated in it. so also putting into their minds (in an age appropriate way) that gender will forever be a construct and we should be allowed to express ourselves in whatever way is most fitting to us."
MaliciousCompliance,fmg14tm,t3_fv0dqs,1586039091.0,"!!!! i have a very similar story:

when i was younger, my older sister would force me into her (carpeted) room and the to ‘bond’ over having me clean her room for her. i would always get out of it somehow, telling her it was my turn to do dishes or laundry or that i had to go to the restroom. i would then leave and lock myself in the restroom that was across her room. at some point she caught on and wouldn’t let me leave anymore until i cleaned. 

this one day i actually did have to go to the restroom and told her. she was standing in front of the doors and her response? “if you really have to go, you can go right here.” 

so i do. i closed my eyes, stood still, and felt my pants get warm and wet. i made a small puddle before she yelled at me to get out. never made me clean her room again. 

still have carpeted floor and the stain isn’t as noticeable as her dog has made many more throughout the years."

demisexuality,fj630kq,t3_fboweo,1583054183.0,"omg thank you so much for asking this! ive been questioning whether or not to ask this question here. ive had sexual attraction to people i’ve had rocky relationships w, and while i want to pursue them sexually i didn’t know if i had to rethink my sexuality because i knew i didn’t want a romantic relationship. 

but the way i think of it is, being demi means we have some type of emotional connection. whether or not it leads to a relationship, is our prerogative. i think so far we’ve been thinking of demisexuality as only a relationship oriented sexuality. 

do what makes you happy and ultimately, identify as you feel fit. sexuality is a septum and we don’t always conform to the labels provided to us."
