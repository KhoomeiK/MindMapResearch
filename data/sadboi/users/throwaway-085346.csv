•Move to a different area (out of my comfort zone)

SuicideWatch,f57lr37,t3_dn0iv6,1572038746.0,"I’m in the exact same position to a tee, I have vowed to try change myself.

I asked myself how tf do I expect to get a gf if I just sit in bed out of view from them and society everyday, most girls won’t know I exist unless I get myself out there.

Therefore I’m moving, getting out of my comfort zone, I’m not saying It’ll work but it’s better than wallowing in self pity like I do everyday for past 6 years."
AskReddit,f55vyhf,t1_f55vq8l,1572014576.0,"I’m 19 and used to eat like crap, just eat out all the time, not only wasting mass amounts of money I could be saving up but McDonald’s and all the junk food is full of fat and badness.

Recently I’ve stopped eating out and eat nothing but strawberries, red apples, red grapes and pasta/chicken meals.


Needless to say I feel better already"
AskReddit,f55tfo8,t1_f55t6zv,1572013414.0,"Needed to hear this, I’m 19 I’m so caught up in what others thoughts on me might be I’m not living in the moment how I’d like to."
AskReddit,f4kkcmi,t1_f4kjwyo,1571653109.0,"Thanks man, I’m at that age where it feels like it’s make or break in life, I’ve learnt from older people how important it is to make decisions as a young adult so you have no regrets in the future.

Time just seems against me sometimes, we really like each other but I can’t even say let’s meet because of the travel time and money constraints. 

If I get a job I’ve applied for which is near hers with accommodation it’ll be perfect, she lives with her parents still."
AskReddit,f4kk4p2,t1_f4kjopm,1571652971.0,"It’s easier to get the train, one change from mine and you’re in the city within 2-2 and a half hours, then you get a tube and a you’re at her area in 25 minutes, I’m trying to move but it’s difficult with lack of money I’d have to get job with accommodation there as that’s my quickest solution which I’m trying to do currently."
AskReddit,f4kjvhv,t1_f4kjlnm,1571652810.0,"It’s not an issue I’d just like to be closer, I plan to move near her soon just building up funds and finding a job there.


I know in America people travel 5hours or more so when I think of that I know we can do this, just money is the issue really"
AskReddit,f4kjrtx,t1_f4kjk19,1571652742.0,"Yes but it’s easier to get a train into the city, car takes 3 hours, train takes 2 hours because you avoid congested roads. She’s from the outskirts of London"

ForeverAlone,f4ic5j3,t1_f4i9vkm,1571602237.0,"Thanks I’ll try, I’m 18 but feel like I’ll never find happiness now, doesn’t help all I think about is sex all day everyday and I’ve been to hookas to control my urges and spent lots of money, even the hookas say I’m good looking and seem a bit confused when they see me. I’ve even done it with 50+ year old woman but I feel ashamed and if she my crush found out she would hate me.

Just proves it doesn’t matter being a virgin, loosing it doesn’t make you happy, only with the right person it does."
ForeverAlone,f4i76pz,t1_f4i2mdr,1571600761.0,"Thanks for this reply I think I’m the third one I’ve literally never asked anyone out because of rejection even the girls that have shown the signs of love for me.

I severely mentally ill too so don’t want to waste their time or bring them down with my shitty illness. 

Additionally I’m not in to many girls, I’ve only ever had a crush on two girls who I could see spending the rest of my life with and starting a family with, one of them being extremely Wife material, I’m just too scared to make a move with her though as her rejection it would ruin me.

My depression has made it extremely hard to find happiness in things, therefore the only thing I have interest in (relationship) isn’t as strong as it once was and for a girl to win my heart she has to be a certain type which the one I adore really is, she always shows interest when we message and replies instantly, not only is she beautiful but she is the kindest girl going which I didn’t know they still existed. 

She melts my heart but I’m too scared the thought of a rejection from her my only true love would break me into a 1000 pieces and My life would be over."

AskUK,f45owx4,t1_f44v79m,1571387686.0,"How old are you, if you are in your 30’s 40’s it’s not too late to meet new people, at that age people don’t really do friends anyway they usually have associates and most of those are work colleagues.

I will admit it’s a lot more difficult to make friends on those age brackets however it is possible especially if you live in an area filled with that age bracket.

Might sound generic but go to the gym, take up football, there’s clubs for teens, people In their 20’s 30’s and so on. My brother who is in his 30’s use to be in a club and he started later as a beginner and met some great people who he is still in contact with years 6 years later.

Life will pass us all by so fast, once my childhood ended I realised this, you’ve got this just honestly the best advice I can give is to get out there and participate in things with a community feel and something will give."
AskUK,f42c3fl,t3_dj8oni,1571329929.0,"Take up sports or exercising, it’s incredible how freeing a walk or jogging session can be. You can take a friend or SO with you and go explore places you wouldn’t have seen otherwise. Not to mention you will feel healthier and will see changes to your body.

Additionally most people on weeknights and weekends socialise and go to bars, clubs, restaurants or hobby events.

You’re in your prime at 23 don’t take it for granted as when you get older your time will become much more limited and your body will get more frail limiting what you can do in your free time."

I love London, the people there are my type of people, even the way I speak and conduct myself is similar to many I know and speak to there, I just feel like that’s my destiny to live there. I’ll have a better way of life with more opportunities than currently."

AskUK,f3vmkyk,t3_difeny,1571179575.0,"Hate it, I’ve got depression so that’s why I am a hermit. I’m trying to change it by building up money to move to London somewhere I’ve always wanted to live and if I’d had been born there I wouldn’t be in this mess.

I’ve missed out on childhood and basic human wants, London is my last hope really the past couple of years have been terrible, lost my friend to suicide at age 14, the list goes on.

Everyday is filled with constant unbearable pain that won’t go away.

We hope for better days."
ForeverAlone,f3vg4d1,t1_f3vdwhb,1571175628.0,"Sounds like my situation, I’m really good when it comes to romance just haven’t had the chance to prove it yet.

I also live in a very secluded spot where not many social activities take place and the the population is mainly old people I believe this is the reason I’m on here.

All of this has took its toll on my mental health and I’ve realised a lot, I have people on my social media’s who live in London, they have everything going for them there where as I have nothing in terms of opportunity here for jobs or for romance and love, I’m at a loose end quite honestly man, to the point where I don’t see any worth in my life anymore. I feel trapped with no solution, feel like I’ve missed out on childhood and basic human experiences.

I’m trying to move there but money is tight."

My only gateway out of this is to move to London  and rent a room or house share which I’m trying hard to do but it’s difficult as it’s expensive there.

One day I want children but I will make sure before I do that I am fairly wealthy so I can give them the best quality of life a child could wish for, I don’t want them living the same childhood I had."

AskReddit,f3kce8q,t1_f3kauo3,1570964233.0,"Thanks for the reply and giving me the time of day, today’s been One of the worst days In a long time. One of those days where it seems everything is against you, I’ve missed out on my childhood due to my mother’s situation she put me In by having multiple children when she couldn’t even afford to live herself, as a result of this my life has been in turmoil ever since. Now I am 18 things have only got worse as the job market where I live is sooo soo bad being in a rural area there’s nothing for me.

I want to move to London it’s been a dream of mine, I know quite a few people there of my age and they appeal to me so much as they are so similar to me, girls there also have shown a mass interest the times that I’ve been there and it’s just my way of life there, the place where I feel I belong when I’m there I feel like that’s my true home if that makes sense.

The way I speak and conduct myself is totally different to my family that’s why I’ve often thought I could be adopted even though it’s proven I’m not. 

I just hope things work out because at the minute I feel like I’m nearing tipping point, I feel trapped with no way of of this cobweb of shit I’ve been caught in for years."
