relationship_advice,for4xfn,t3_g93pn5,1588006237.0,"I think the most you can do is advise her to seek professional help because this sounds an awful lot like body dysmorphia, although of course the choice is up to her. Don’t feel guilty for being tired of her self criticism because I know it can be a downer and somewhat draining to hear, you need to take care of yourself too. Suggest her some body positivity accounts on the social media she uses to follow and in conversation avoid topics about weight and size since it seems to be something that brings her down. 

Sometimes it’s easier to start with body neutrality than positivity. Try to get to think of her body objectively, instead of saying something like “your body is beautiful” which can trigger denial and further negativity, say “your body is strong and healthy, I am glad your legs can walk so we can go shopping together, I am glad you have arms so we can hug” or something like that although maybe a bit more eloquent, sorry socialising has never been my forte :p

Best of luck and well wishes to you and your friend!"
