AppleMusic,fivrpz5,t3_f9xkxf,1582766566.0,"Mine is a bit over the top for most people, I would imagine, but I'll share.

I rate songs from 1 to 5 stars in iTunes and create different Smart Playlist depending on the star.

I rate my starred songs by a ratio of how many times I've played a song vs. how many times I have skipped it. For example, if a song has been played 9 times and skipped only once, I divide 9 into 10 and get .90 for 90%.

5 Stars: 90% and above. Basically, the all time favorites.

4 Stars: Between 75-89%. I set it so if I have played the song in the last 3 days or skipped in last 7, it won't show up in the Smart Playlist.

3 Stars: Between 50-74%. Played in last week or skipped in last 2 weeks, it won't show up.

2 Stars: Anything less than 50%. Played in last 2 weeks or skipped in last 3 weeks, it won't show up.

1 Star: Any song I add myself to my library that I have heard before and know I like, but hasn't been played in iTunes/Apple Music yet.

I create one more playlist for any 0 plays songs without a rating. I make a rule in the playlist to not include the 1 star songs. This is reserved for adding full albums of things I have never listened to or even know if i will like. A lot the ""New Music Mix"" playlists go in here for example.

I create one massive playlist that combines all these different Smart Playlist. On iTunes, it will update itself when you play a song. But on Apple Music, you have to have a copy of the massive playlist, but it won't update automatically. You will have to go into iTunes sporadically and do it yourself.

I add up how many songs are in the 5 Star playlist and the 1 Star playlist. Let's say there's a 1,000 total songs between the two. Between the other 4 playlist, I take 25% of that 1,000 and limit the amount of songs in that playlist. In this case, 250 in 2 thru 4 stars and the 0 playlist. This helps balance the playlist out so it's a 1,000 songs of your favorites or at least songs that are recently added but I know I like, and another 1,000 where it's a mix of okay songs and brand new. That way, you aren't bombarded by a ton of mediocre or brand new songs.

Obviously, initially giving every song a rating is daunting and took me awhile. But now I update usually on Sundays and it takes me like 15 minutes. I like this system because it will play my all times favs, some of the good to okay stuff, new stuff I've added whether I know it already or not. Mix of familiarity and new stuff.

Sorry if this is a little confusing and weird, but I wanted to share."

For the 3rd book, I just pick a book at random. I use a random number generator and whatever number it lands on in my list, I either decide to read it or remove it from my list. The way I look at it, if I'm not going to read the book after I randomly select it, I'll probably end up never reading it. It also acts as a nice way to clean up the list. After that 3rd book, I cycle back to picking whatever I want.

She deleted the app a couple months ago. I finally did a few weeks ago, but still follow this sub out of curiosity to see what ends up happening with the app. It's sad how quick the app demised. It was fun for awhile, but it just isn't the same anymore. It's too bad."
LiveFromNewYork,etmv3am,t1_etm8mkm,1562969316.0,Louie Anderson sounds like a good man from what I've gathered over the years. He's amazing on Baskets too. Great to hear he was supportive of you.
breakingbad,etjzomn,t1_etjtluz,1562885278.0,"I read an article awhile back about the house seen in the opening of ""All in the Family"" use to have similar issues as Walter's house back in the 70s. I don't remember all the details, but I think an older woman owned the house and wasn't very happy when people came around to check the house out. Over the decades, less and less people came to see the house as the show faded from popularity."

Assistance,esq05ai,t3_c8u6pv,1562193066.0,"You need to find subreddits that interest you and comment on posts. For example, I love baseball and will post in r/baseball sometimes. I don't always get an upvote, but I'll get 5 or so every now and then. It adds up over time. You can also make new posts into communities and gain karma that way, kind of like this post here. It can be as simple as posting a funny picture you came across or an interesting story that relates to the subreddit. 

There's really no rhyme or reason to what gets upvoted though. I've posted things I thought were funny and get no upvotes and dumb comments that get 50. It's a crapshoot. But it builds up overtime. As for getting a lot of karma quickly, it really just depends on how interesting your posts are.

Good luck."

Foul ball comes directly at us. Kind of fast, but catchable. My friend SHOVES me out of the way to make a play on it. At the last second, he moves his hands out of the way like he was afraid to catch it. Ball hits a railing and headed down to the lower level. To this day I still give him crap."
