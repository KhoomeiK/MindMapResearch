leagueoflegends,fqoitan,t1_fqnnxwm,1589516213.0,"ye but the animated series is like a vi and jinx origin story its not gonna majorly progress the lore.  


Im like at the point where its just really frustrating me reading lore, cuz riot isn't progressing shit. I read all these cool stories, and i care about the characters, but we never get more on them. I feel like riot needs to up their release of lore by 10x the amount."
leagueoflegends,fqoey0o,t1_fqnn6ez,1589513716.0,"but they dont really do that for straight characters either. Did you know darius has a wife and kids? Not by anything he does in game its only confirmed in lore. Draven, Jayce, Vi, Caitlyn, Yasuo, Riven, on and on they have nothing on their love life. Vast majority of champs dont have any inclination to sexual preferences.  


Neeko has voice lines indicating shes interested in women"
leagueoflegends,fqod5y9,t1_fqnphba,1589512597.0,"also its heavily implied that Neeko was in love with Nidalee, but they dont have a color story on her time with Nidalee. If they did release a story of her and nidalee, they could show her feeling toward her.

leagueoflegends,fqo1n4g,t1_fqnbbwb,1589505736.0,"to me yuumi is balanced champion, but that doesn't make her well designed.   


If a champ is out of hand, the key is to focus them and kill them. If a Sona or Soraka is healing too much, you kill them because they are squishy supports. Yuumi can just stay on the carry and theres nothing you can do to stop that healing from coming, like you can do with sona/soraka. That makes her frustrating to go against, it makes a player feel like they don't have the agency they need against her. And a bad yuumi will basically just afk in lane, making you feel like you are 1v2 if shes on your team. Overall, her design leads to either team feeling bad about her, which just makes her badly designed.  


The meteos clip just perfectly applies to this situation- Just because Riot can make an innovative design and it be balanced, doesn't mean it was a good idea."

And he didn't even hit anyone or drive erratically, his driving was mostly normal, he got pulled over because he was going a bit too fast and the officer made him take a breathalyzer test and he was a little over the legal limit.   


So the point being, even if they think they are good enough to drive and not hurt anyone- they are still risking a DUI (obviously the risk that they might hurt somebody should be a deterrent enough from driving tipsy but sadly it isn't always, and framing it in this way might help them stop)

My brother in law is an alcoholic, he's been drinking ever since he was a young teen and he just is unable to stop himself from binge drinking beer all day once he starts.

""it would be awful if he had to stop drinking forever, he just needs to drink responsibly!"" because 1) they dont understand how alcoholism works and that he simply cannot be responsible about his alcohol intake and 2) they literally value alcohol so much they think it would be wrong for him to never be able to drink it again. They just think it's too important, and that life loses value if you can't get drunk.  


it fucking disgusts and enrages me (and my mom is the only one who actually knows and agrees with me that he has to stop drinking entirely)  


Although, my family at least never pressures me into drinking once I made it clear and set my boundaries that I will never drink that stuff (i have an addictive personality and i do not want to end up an alcoholic like my dad was, and almost my entire family abuses alcohol too much\_)"

Most of us do really love our country, but we also see the faults in it and wish for it to be better (and everyone has different ideas on how it could be better or how it should be)   


But you definitely should blame any Americans who refuse to see other side of things, who refuse to learn more and be better... because like I'm not like that, and nor are the majority of my friends / family"
relationship_advice,fprazzj,t1_fpr4cjz,1588848736.0,"damn, sorry you've ran into some bad Americans- I promise we are not all like that! Especially it is one thing for someone to initially make the mistake of assuming you must be poor, you could assume that to ignorance not malice. But if you've corrected them once, then it should never happen again.   


Sounds like you showed your boyfriend repeatedly that he was wrong, and he didn't listen or care and chose to repeatedly act superior to you instead of learning from it. This is perfectly reasonable to break up with him over that"

Your mindset to just blame it on your team isn’t a healthy mindset to have if your goal is to improve and climb. Of course there are some games that aren’t winnable, and some games you can’t carry that’s just part of the game (and life in general). But there’s always something you can look at and learn from to see what you personally could’ve done better. You can’t change your teammates being gold, you can only affect yourself, and improve yourself so you can carry and become higher rank."
