Persona5,fr5m59s,t3_gmjqo7,1589910834.0,Akechi and Ryuji sitcom
Persona5,fr5lxul,t1_fr58ewf,1589910733.0,He probably wouldn't want to be near them either. He makes a point to distance himself. When you play darts with him only Morgans shows up (mind you Morgana is probably also the most sympathetic to Akechi and he has to be there because he's in your bag).
Persona5,fr5li9n,t1_fr47ljw,1589910521.0,It's both. He has a lone wolf mentality and can't bond with people. That's why he sits alone.
Persona5,fr5ldsc,t1_fr3q36z,1589910462.0,And it's also hard to find him in Royal's main menu.
Persona5,fr5lbrm,t1_fr404fb,1589910436.0,He's in trailers on the team and on the boxart. He also is in PQ2 as Phantom Thief. ATLUS doesn't hide his involvement.
Persona5,fr5l6ls,t1_fr42tce,1589910370.0,"This fanbase is stupid and thinks ""why do they forgive Akechi"", they literally never do. Haru and Ryuji even say so."
Persona5,fr5l0rl,t1_fr43un2,1589910295.0,"She's open minded and sees his a manipulated victim but she also knows that doesn't excuse his actions and won't ever fully forgive him for what he did.






Basically she values him as a teammate but she wouldn't want to be his friend."
Persona5,fr5kpgk,t3_gmsm1r,1589910149.0,Even Akechi himself agrees. He finds his fanbase stupid for buying the Prince act.
Persona5,fr5ki12,t1_fr5k53v,1589910053.0,"She did ask him ""I want to be Kasumi"", she ran away from her problems and had someone solve it for her. It does make her arc more impactful though."
Persona5,fr5kcfz,t3_gmj4n8,1589909980.0,It's sad because I thought it was very clear society being the sin of sloth was the message of the game but nobody seems to see that. Makoto even makes it abundantly clear when you go to her in the velvet room.
Persona5,fr5jzcv,t1_fr590dr,1589909807.0,But it's hypocritical coming from her because of what she did.

I need this figure."

Persona5,fr5jc2b,t1_fr5hj9x,1589909499.0,"Sumire being erased was the creepiest thing but I would have made one change. In this Maruki ending, she now has brown hair and a mole."

Persona5,fr5hyil,t1_fr5dxqf,1589908860.0,I may be wrong but I thought he wanted the 17 yr old to beat sense into him. Knock the crap outta him.
ChurchOfKasumi,fr5hqi0,t1_fr5hdq1,1589908758.0,"Tbh I know he's annoying but I feel like r/Persona5 hates him too much. The whole Ryuji vs Morgana thing gets brought up there every single day. They're both childish and neither of them are innocent. It's no different from 2 brothers constantly bickering but deep down they don't actually hate each other. It's toxic yes but r/Persona5 bringing up everyday is so annoying.




It's refreshing to see someone like the cat. He has a cool voice actress who reacted to the Cool Cat movie as Morgana."

Taylor was his first mistake that narrowed it down to the Kanto region of Japan, then his 2nd mistake was killing inmates through his dad's computer which let them know it was someone connected to the police. The final nail in the coffin was killing the FBI agents. After that they should have just arrested Light."

ChurchOfKasumi,fr3r1no,t1_fr3qncl,1589863953.0,"I don't like Kawakami personally but I'm upvoting you because I hate Yukari. She's literally the villain of the answer, the most toxic person in existence and is detrimental to the entire team. She fucking wanted to stop Makoto Yuki from dying so that she could get more of his dick BUT IF HE DIDN'T BECOME A DOOR ALL OF HUMANITY WOULD HAVE DIED. And she has the audacity to call Akihiko selfish because he respected the protagonist's sacrifice and knew he died to save us all and if he didn't die it would all be for nothing.







Sumire loves Ren Amamiya as much as Aigis loved Makoto-san."
ChurchOfKasumi,fr3qib1,t1_fr3pwsg,1589863552.0,I still like Makoto but I just feel like man... Sumire has the most meaningful relationship with the protagonist. I haven't felt a connection like that since best girl Aigis from P3.
ChurchOfKasumi,fr3qeoz,t1_fr3pyj9,1589863478.0,They're relationship is also actually a meaningful connection which we haven't had since best girl Aigis from P3
ChurchOfKasumi,fr3pggx,t1_fr3otcn,1589862789.0,"I used to be a Makoto fan but after 3 Royal playthroughs I've come to the conclusion that they went out of their way to try to make the Sumire arc as compelling as possible. They were very careful so that she would be very likable. Her story is tragic (and honestly creepy) and it's the most interesting backstory in the game.





It kind of makes the other girls in the game look less interesting as a result. It's a shame she isn't in Scramble but it is what it is."
Mortalkombatleaks,fr3p72j,t1_fr34k2r,1589862600.0,"How is Reptile a ""waste""?"
Mortalkombatleaks,fr3p3p3,t1_fr34lg6,1589862533.0,They really do whatever the hell they want. That's why they put in Jacqui. Thank fuck the Noob requests got through their thick skulls and they put in our shadowy boi.
Mortalkombatleaks,fr3p015,t1_fr33ep0,1589862461.0,"I mean eventually they have to put in characters people like because they'd be left with trash like Hsu Hao, Mokap, and Meat."
Mortalkombatleaks,fr3otsm,t1_fr2w1yu,1589862335.0,Honestly it's kind of mean spirited.
Mortalkombatleaks,fr3oq3m,t3_gmcxi5,1589862261.0,They did put in Noob after tons of requests. Clearly they do listen to feedback to some extent. This is honestly just Syed being edgy.
ChurchOfKasumi,fr3oer7,t3_gmcbds,1589862036.0,"No matter who you're best girl used to be, you can't deny that these two just go together. Marie came off as forced, annoying, and a total bitch. Sumire is wonderful. ‚ù§"
akechididnothingwrong,fr37f8l,t3_gmbu6v,1589851461.0,"I always play this alt and this art is better than the actual alt because they got Akechi's eye color right. The actual alt keeps Joker's gray eyes which is a shame because they changed eye color on a few Hero alts and one Banjo alt, and most famously the Meta Knight Kirby alt. They could have made his eyes red like Akechi's, it's a shame."
Persona5,fr376wb,t1_fr30g4f,1589851326.0,"I think her English VA did a good job, she even added mild autism to her character which is nice representation. 



I don't really play games or watch anime in Japanese so I wouldn't know how much better it is. I enjoy something in a language I understand and it helps me feel the character's emotions better. I usually get yelled at for watching dubbed but I do think it's a problem. A lot of English VAs are good."
Persona5,fr2zzkn,t1_fr2zxon,1589847198.0,Futaba was a very good character and then she just becomes a gamer joke.
Persona5,fr2zry9,t1_fr2xoz4,1589847077.0,"I actually really liked Yusuke and Makoto in particular but Yusuke literally just becomes ""Haha art"" and Makoto becomes ""Haha studies"". Every character becomes a caricature of themselves."
Persona5,fr2xh3x,t1_fr2wfpz,1589845792.0,"Honestly I used to like some of them but the entire new semester I wish they were never there. The trio had an actual good dynamic and the thieves ruined the Akechi partnership.





I think all the thieves are too similar. Same origin story rehashed everytime."

She's such a sweetheart."
