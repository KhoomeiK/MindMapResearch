d100,fpoun85,t3_f6b9m5,1588790951.0,"Name: The Pearl Tear

Description: A pearl tear-shaped pendant that is somewhat damaged

History: The Pear Tear had belonged to Ashlynn Meshi, the daughter of Lord Leroux and Lady Ingrid Meshi. Ashlynn had fallen in love with the son of a local baron, Donatien Dannu. Even though Dannu's father was known to be a corrupt and manipulative man, Ashlynn had believed that she could keep Dannu from becoming his father. Unfortunately, Dannu had become his father in the way that he had treated Meshi, abusing her both physically and emotionally. 

When she had tried to talk to Dannu's brother, Titus, about her lover's actions, Titus had brushed her off. Unfortunately, Dannu found out and had beaten her. After what seemed like an eternity of beatings, Dannu had strangled Meshi, killing her. Afraid that he would be executed for what he had done, he had buried Meshi in an unmarked grave, taking the Pearl Tear with him. 

Trigger and Effects: Upon a PC donning the necklace, they will endure a shortness of breath lasting a round and intense anxiety. After the round is finished, the PC will notice an anxious woman on a successful perception roll. If the PC chooses to approach the woman, she will beg the PC to stay away from her before quickly vanishing. During a long rest, the PC will have visions of the woman being hurt by a man hidden in the shadows. On a third long rest, the PC will receive a vision of the woman being badly beaten and strangled. After the woman has passed, the shadowy man will glance at the PC with a look of intense hatred. Upon waking, the PC must make a Wisdom saving throw. Upon a failure, the PC is frightened until a Calm Emotions spell is cast. On a fourth long rest, the PC will encounter the same woman they had encountered but sitting in a way that covers her face with her knees. If the PC chooses to interact with her, the woman will left her head revealing a bloody nose, black eye, and bruises on her neck. If the PC is still frightened, they will have disadvantage on any checks to interact with her. Either way, she will tell the PC about her necklace and where her lover had buried her. 

Appeasement: To put Meshi to rest, the PC must give her a proper funeral with the Pearl Tear. After the funeral, the woman will appear to the PC, her injuries healed. She will give thanks to the PC for ending her suffering and ascend to Paradise.  The PC will no longer be frightened and will have advantage on the next persuasion roll they make."

If I had to guess, it would be because of the trauma attached to the memory of ""decapitated by sword"" or ""suicide by poison"" is stronger than ""slipped away peacefully at 95"". In the case of soldiers, many of them pass young, sometimes leaving children behind. Likewise, they most likely have already established trauma from being surrounded by mass death almost 24/7. In the case of violence, that can be caused by many things. In my case, it was the helplessness and agony that came from being beaten/strangled. Hope this helps."

Description: A diamond ring attached to a skeletal hand. The inside is engraved with initials. 

Backstory: The ring was given to a young woman by the name of Abelina Connan when she had accepted Jeoffroi Nahei's proposal for marriage. For the few months they had spent together, both had made plans for the wedding. However, the plans would be put on hold, when Jeoffri had boarded his ship, The *Strongbow*, for a diplomacy mission to the Sodridan Dynasty. Abelina was concerned, seeing as how pirates had a habit for attacking and sinking ships. Nahei had assured her that if something happened to him, he would send out a message in a bottle. 

Abelina had awaited his return, hoping to make him her husband. However, her hopes would be dashed when the message in the bottle arrived. The letter read that he was captured by pirates and stated that if she would recieve this letter, he would've been dead at the hands of the pirates. For a week afterwards, Abelina was in a deep mourning, almost never leaving her home and sobbing almost every day. After a week, Abelina had drowned herself in the wedding dress she bought herself. 

Trigger/Effects: Upon a PC donning the ring, they would notice a sinking feeling within themselves. Likewise, upon a successful perception check, they would notice a solemn woman in the corner of their eyes. When they enter a long rest, they will dream of the events that surrounded the ring's owner and her suicide. At the end of a week, the PC will see the woman with the veil covering her face. Upon the veil being uncovered, the PC must make a Wisdom Save. On a success, a beautiful woman will be behind the veil. On a failure, however, the face of a corpse will be unveiled sputtering and gasping, leaving the PC frightened for an hour. Regardless of outcome, the woman would describe the method to put her to rest. 

Appeasement: To put Abelina to rest, her ring must be given to a faithful bride on her wedding day. After the ring is given, the PC who wore the ring feels a sense of relief. Likewise, they will witness Abelina and her lover embracing, thanking the PC for bringing the two lovers together after years of being apart, gaining advantage on the next wisdom save the PC rolls.
