depression,etqnnkq,t1_etqneye,1563093585.0,"I would love to be able to say, meds are 100% bad news rarrrr. 

But the truth is, everyones different. Depression is so misunderstood, one thing will never fix everyone. For me, meds prevented me from forcing myself to form coping methods. I used them like a crutch instead of a springboard.

How old are you if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?"
depression,etqnd0p,t1_etqn3j1,1563093157.0,Man i remember my first bottle of ativan.. that cured everything by turning me into a drooling slurring zombie. I way way overdid it. I had to stop going to the doc cuz he was handing them out like candy. I was taking like 3-5mg a day which I think is alot. I had to quit cold turkey.. and it was miserable. Never again.

depression,etqlzrt,t1_etozkhc,1563091188.0,"Why cant they? I think after reading all these messages, the best thing for all of us is to make a voice chat somewhere. I don‚Äôt want to lock anyone in to some activity, just a 24/7 voice chat that people can join and make friends in and then do whatever they want."
depression,etqlwjt,t1_etoy228,1563091062.0,"That‚Äôs awesome and I will look into this. Seeing as how we are scattered all over the globe, maybe best thing in the short-term is to do some online voice chat and see what happens? I know it‚Äôs not as great as all of us being able to be physically next to eachother, but it‚Äôs social time without having to explain ‚Äúwhy so glum‚Äù and stuff like that."
depression,etqlrgs,t1_etoxtq6,1563090860.0,I‚Äôm gonna focus on this and make it happen I promise you. Because I know how you feel exactly and you don‚Äôt have to say a word
depression,etqlpyz,t1_etowy3j,1563090801.0,"Yep, god I use the tired excuse all the time. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to just say exactly what was on your mind?

depression,etqlmaj,t1_etow9kp,1563090656.0,"It is a bit paradoxical, but I‚Äôm hopelessly optimistic about it. I feel that depressed people don‚Äôt give themselves enough opportunity to form social circles. We want them badly (at least I do), theres just like a broken wire in there that won‚Äôt let the signal through.

You feel like helping in breaking this little conundrum? Please?"
depression,etqli1h,t1_etovl98,1563090488.0,"Yeah, I can see this being a thing. Having depression doesn‚Äôt always make someone a good person and jerks are everywhere. I would just hope it would be more positive. Treating the depression is still important, this is just a nice scheduled distraction. Something to look forward to."
depression,etqld21,t1_etove6m,1563090295.0,"Imagine a room full of people in varying degrees of it. Some days maybe you didn‚Äôt feel like cooking, well there could be food there.

depression,etql84c,t1_etosn4v,1563090104.0,"That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm after. A place to go where no one looks at you funny for the things depression imposes on us. It‚Äôs not about the depression exactly, it‚Äôs just about having friends who totally understand and relate. You are right about the balance. 

The steadiness I want will be about balancing alone time with social time, and not having to make up excuses or lie to get out of a gathering. You can just say what‚Äôs really bugging you, you don‚Äôt feel like hanging that day, and the crowd says cool we get it. If you change your mind we‚Äôre here. Maybe the lack of pressure on the situation will make you say, hell, might as well check it out, I can leave in 20 mins if it sucks and no one will question why.

We can just say, I‚Äôm feeling blah, gonna head out. 

Sometimes i go to like a family picnic and all I can think about is leaving and how to do it without sounding like I‚Äôm flakey. So I lie and make shit up instead of just being able to say, just not feeling it today guys.."
