That’s the risk you take (then again, the same is true for any relationship since a partner or spouse can either leave you for another at any time or commit adultery. These are the chances we take on love and companionship for another. Our sentiments rest with them, as do theirs with us).

You’ll have to be willing to accept the consequences if things don’t go how you want them to. That’s why I keep using the word “risk.” If this is something you truly want, something you’re willing to bargain for, accepting the forethought that things can take a turn for the worse if he disagrees, then go for it.

buildapc,fmmxxde,t3_fw3a9n,1586214196.0,"When I was building my first computer a few years ago, I had the same question and went through a few paste. Now that I have made several dozen builds, including repasting GPUs and delidding Intel CPUs, here are my favorite go-to paste:

(1) Best overall paste is Arctic MX-4. It’s cheap, effective, spreads easily, cleans easily, and does very well on air coolers and all-in-ones. Unlike a few other paste, there is no “burn-in” time. You set it and go.

(2) Another contender for the overall category is Noctua’s NT-H2, great for moderate overclocks, but unlike Arctic MX-4, is a little more expensive, harder to spread and harder to clean. And, like the Arctic MX-4, it works great on air coolers and all-in-ones.

(3) Best paste for overclocking would fall between Thermal Grizzly’s Kryonaut and Gelid GC-Extreme. You can usually find the former more expensively than the latter. I prefer to use these on my GPU and/ or an all-in-one cooler, but both would work fine with air coolers. The former is harder to spread and clean than the latter paste.

(4) You can never go wrong with old-faithful: Arctic Silver 5. It’s one of the oldest thermal paste on the list that’s been trusted over the years for its reliability, easily application, affordability, and cleaning. However, there has always been debate as to whether it is safe to use because of its alleged conductivity. I would, therefore, only use it on a CPU’s IHS with either an air cooler or all-in-one. Note: it’s best to let Arctic Silver 5 sit for about four hours before turning on your PC.

(5) Finally, unlike the paste mentioned above, Thermal Grizzly’s Conductonaut is a liquid metal thermal compound that is excellent for reducing temperatures and overlocking. It’s what I use when delidding my CPUs and repasting them. However, and big disclaimer: I wouldn’t use it with copper or aluminum plated coolers, whether they be air or liquid cooling. It will destroy aluminum and tarnish copper. Also, it takes a very steady hand and patience to spread. What’s more, it is highly conductive and can damage surrounding components if done incorrectly.

To conclude, go with the safe cheaper option: Arctic MX-4, then later, mess around with other paste to gain a better perspective on cooling. Also, don’t use those stupid applicators that come with a few of these paste (except for number 5; you need the applicator to spread the liquid metal). RULE OF THUMB: use the pea/ grain of rice method, placed at the center (remember, less is more). Then set your cooler and screw it on in a zigzag pattern to ensure that the paste spreads evenly as the cooler tightens to the CPU and socket. And do not over-tighten your cooler.

AskGayMen,fk54q6i,t3_fg9kk5,1583873426.0,"Dear OP,

Dude, I hate to break it to you but, whatever morsels of happiness you may incur in the following days, months, or years, will bring you little joy as long as you suppress your true self. This might be a terrible analogy but, to deny who you are is akin to holding one’s breath till one is blue in the face. You have to exhale. Let go. 

Remember, this is your life to live and no one else’s. What’s more, we unfortunately still live in a world where “coming out of the closet” is a method of engaging those we love and hold dear to accept us for being different. Truth is, being a homosexual/ bisexual/ transsexual and the like, are as normal as the air we breath and as clear as the water we drink.

But, if you must come out as a coming to terms with who you are or as a coming of age type of thing, do it on your terms. This is your life to live and no one else’s. So live it. Don’t sacrifice your happiness for the good of others.

It took me 31 years to come out as bisexual to people I truly love. I’ve known about my bisexuality since I was a little boy. I tried coming out to friends in high school. I followed my declaration of bisexuality with a long-winded reason as to how I knew what I was and when it occurred to me—why should anyone have to explain who they are simply for being true to themselves? All they heard was the public stigmas associated to bisexuality. Many of them abandoned me because of my bisexuality. For years I thought, if I only repressed who I was, I would have been able to salvage the friends I lost after telling them my secret. It wasn’t until recently that I learned how wrong my thinking was.

It times to live, to live well, and to be happy. The shortness of life is something we all take for granted. Be true dude.

Cheers!"

You can purchase a generic cable for the G502 Hero on Amazon or EBay, as well as mouse feet from the same aforementioned marketplaces.

All you need is a hair dryer or a heat gun, a screw driver for tiny screws, 75-90% alcohol, and a little patience.

(1) use the hair dryer/ heat gun to heat the feet a little to make it easier to remove the mouse feet. You can use a plastic razor or a guitar pic to help you lift them up and remove them.

(2) once the skates are off, use your screw driver to remove all of the screws at the bottom of the mouse.

(3) once that’s done, you want to separate the two halves of the mouse, but do it slowly and very carefully since there is a ribbon cable that attaches the top of the mouse shell to the PCB within. You can use your guitar pic to separate the two halves.

(4) then, you can unscrew the mouse wheel apparatus, being careful not to lose the springs. Then unscrew the screws holding down the PCB. Once removed, you can detached the defective plug, install the new one, rerouting the cable into the grooves underneath the PCB.

(5) finally, you work your way backwards, screwing everything back into place. NOTE: do not forget to reattach the ribbon cable. Also, if you purchased additional mouse skates, use the rubbing alcohol to remove any residue left behind by the old feet, then install the new ones.

And your done!"
