I dont see Oden's adventurous spirit in him. Hiyori on the other hand plenty of times proved that she can manage on her own, and might have inherited her father's love for adventure (idk but i see the sparkly quality of Oden's eyes in Hiyori's, as opposed to Toki's subdued ones that I see in Momo). The 9 scabbards are too attached to their country, and they deserved living in Wano peacefully too. But who knows, Hiyori might also be the next temp Shogun and let Momo take on the seas. But im p sure that somebody from Wano will go with the SH, it would go well with the narrative about Wano opening its doors to the world.

Ill wait for Oda though."

OnePiece,fmnn997,t3_fee3p6,1586230101.0,"as somebody who just came back into reading one piece after a long time(the last i read was dressrosa perhaps?but now i caught up), i was surprised over Pudding. Sanji has never been this serious(or as the plot allows) and never had the potential between him and a girl so great that I almost didnt believe what is happening. Like come one, romance? in OP?(i was once a firm believer that Oda doesnt want any romance in OP). Narratively speaking, I could easily read between the lines and i understood that Sanji had found somebody who he will be with in the future. 

So ok, cool. Sanji has a girl. Why not. He's romantic after all. Luffy's not even against it and was happy to welcome a new nakama.

But I'm even more surprised with Zoro. I mean Zoro? Who never even looked at a girl in that way? Being paired with one?! Is the earth ending?!

That's where I rearranged my thoughts on OP. no use denying romance in the series when Im seeing characters getting married one after another(AlladinPraline, BegeChiffon, SaiBaby5, and we'll see where Lola gets in this one).

I admit that you're correct. Hancock, Pudding and Hiyori are made specifically for the Monster Trio. Even their colors compliment them."
