AmItheAsshole,f7agi1v,t3_duxns4,1573528686.0,"YTA. I was in basically this exact same situation earlier this year. When I woke up and sobered up, I thanked the person who called the ambulance because I understood that I literally could have died and he may have saved my life. Be grateful that people care enough about you to do everything in their power to KEEP YOU FROM DYING. Falling off of your bed repeatedly and talking to yourself is not an acceptable level of intoxication. That's not normal, and it is very clear that this was far more serious than you are letting yourself believe. $1000 sucks, but it is so much better than being dead. I also want to say that when I was in this situation, I was sure that they did no tests, no blood draws, no IV fluids, and that I had not thrown up. I was wrong about every single one of those things because I was so far from being conscious that none of those things woke/sobered me up. Of course they ""watched you sleep"", because no shit, that's what they have to do for unconscious drunk people: monitor them and their vital signs and make sure they wake up. I guarantee you they did more than you remember and you should be really fucking grateful. I am also very very sure that you are downplaying this, but even with the information given it is clear that an ambulance was the right call. Don't put others in the situation where they are afraid that, if they do not act correctly, you could die. That is a horrible thing to do to someone you care about. Start taking this seriously, take better care of yourself, have more respect for the people that love and care about you and don't want you to die, and apologize to your roommate for being a gigantic, ungrateful asshole."
