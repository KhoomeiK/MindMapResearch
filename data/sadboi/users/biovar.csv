BPD,flke79c,t3_fpdulj,1585239257.0,"Britney was such a BPD queen lmao, I think about her a lot. But yes, sometimes acting up feels like the only way to show people something's wrong without having to say the dreaded words. I'm usually like that when I get myself to believe that if I simply asked for help it wouldn't go well."
NPD,flk23ke,t1_fljtqgf,1585232284.0,"I said that it's the least stigmatized out of Cluster B disorders because that's what my own experience with having it has been like, as well as something other people have been pointing out, particularly people with ASPD and NPD who seem to be dealing with the worst stigma in the Cluster. I never said BPD is not stigmatized at all, but I absolutely stand by my opinion that ASPD and NPD are demonized much, much more."
BPD,fljkeph,t3_fp7m1y,1585216393.0,"Unless a person with BPD develops gender confusion specifically as a result of psychosis, I generally don't think there's any reason to worry about where the desire to transition ""really"" came from. At the end of the day, what matters is to make sure that transitioning will make you feel better and not worse. You can test the waters by binding and so on, then try a few months of HRT and see how it feels (it's reversible at that stage). If it feels right -- continue."
NPD,fligw81,t3_fozqj1,1585182261.0,"BPD is definitely the least stigmatized out of Cluster B disorders, probably because borderlines are usually great at playing the victim. I've been pretty open about having it for years and I never get any crap for it.

Sorry that the people in your life are making you feel unaccepted. There's really no reason why NPD should be seen as any worse than BPD."
sociopath,flcntez,t3_fng8kp,1585038616.0,"I used to be very impressed with my father when I was little up until I realized how much he was talking himself up. Other than that I never had idols, if anything I used to instinctively lie about caring about various celebrities back in school in order to fit in. I do find success stories and interviews with certain celebrities (creators, businessmen, the self-made kind) interesting since I think it can be useful to analyze what they did right."
BPD,fl9vdri,t3_fnc6j4,1584970294.0,"I felt stuck in that loop right until I got into DBT. It's the only thing that worked for me after I've been to like, 10 other therapies. I used to be unable to handle the rough patches without medication, and now I'm completely meds-free and more self-aware than ever, and it just keeps getting better. BPD is tricky, and relapses can be regular even after getting therapy. But that doesn't mean there's no hope. You just want to turn that loop into an ascending spiral, so that with each round you keep getting a little further up.

P.S.: I think BPD can be very attractive in men."
BPD,fl9tq50,t3_fndqh7,1584969010.0,"My mental disorders first manifested when I was about 13-14, but the symptoms were somewhat ""smudged"" back then, so I was actually misdiagnosed with schizophrenia at first. I only developed a distinctive set of BPD symptoms when I was about 21. So I'd say it's best not to rush into it just yet, unless you can find a really good therapist that specializes in both Cluster B PDs and working with teenagers. You can start learning DBT skills right away though, they're good for anybody regardless."
BPD,fl9q7gh,t3_fng1s1,1584966024.0,"I have similar mood swings too, I think most borderlines do. It's important to figure out what triggers them, because there's always something. For me, it's feeling exhausted -- physically, mentally, emotionally, or a mix of those. Finding that out may have taken a while, but it really improved my life, because now I both know how to mellow myself down when I become irritable AND how to communicate my issues to other people (e.g. ""Sorry about that, I'm in a bad mood because I didn't sleep well last night""), which makes it much easier to avoid pointless conflicts and hurt people less."
NPD,fl9oguy,t3_fn2sxa,1584964316.0,"Any psychiatrist or therapist that openly demonizes people with NPD (or any other PD) clearly lacks professionalism, and I agree with you that it's indeed hypocritical when people like that try to lecture others on kindness and proper behavior. Unfortunately, such attitudes aren't rare in the mental help field, although the stigma seems to be gradually getting less severe. No matter what anyone says, having NPD doesn't make you a lost cause by any means. Some of the most pleasant people in my life had NPD."
