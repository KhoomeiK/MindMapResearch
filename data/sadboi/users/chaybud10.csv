Rainbow6,fnkdj5l,t1_fnkd7j8,1587023059.0,The best part about Mavericks torch imo is that it has pretty small hole so players won’t notice it as easily. And when you are using it he doesn’t shout “A REALLY BIG FUCKING HOLE COMING RIGHT UP” alerting everyone.

Rainbow6,fnkczjp,t3_g2a7lj,1587022501.0,If you like playing it kind of slow pace then I would say maverick. Maestro is good but since he lost his acog I haven’t seen him used as much. Alibi if you want to annoy people. Mozzie is just ok (I personally don’t like him the most). Kali if you like staying in the back with a slow pace game. Wamai is just a knock off jager imo. Personally I would get maverick but ur choice.
