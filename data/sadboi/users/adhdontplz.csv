Experiment with format - audiobook, short stories or novellas which usually pull me out, full series, doorstoppers, graphic novels - I also love - and general novels.

I started off  being relieved by the diagnosis, feeling empowered by accommodations at my university and public speaking about how nuerodiversity can be used for good. Due to various mental and physical health issues piling on in the last year, I then went from a great job (on paper) to being unemployed probably long term.  It opened up a can of worms for co-morbid conditions, so keep an eye out for those. A tip from my therapist is try to hold back on thinking about long term implications until you've done your basic routine, which will naturally put you in a more balanced frame of mind.

P.S: The reason my experience has been largely negative is that it costs a lot - like, at least a thousand - to be medicated in my country, even if you have a stone cold diagnosis.

I tried very halfheartedly to start way back at the beginning then caught a few random episodes, mostly incomplete, on daily motion and the horror channel.

I'm pretty easygoing with doctor who, if an episode has more good parts than bad, or the good parts, however few, personally intrigue me, then I'll probaly like it.

There's been an awful lot of time where the doctor saves the day essentially just by being a god and stating so e.g last of the timelords, eleventh hour, a good man goes to war. For all her faults, you can never imagine 13 doing that. Throughout s11 she was shown to be the most passive, vulnerable version of the doctor in nuwho, unable to change the events of Rosa or demons.

But this passive vulnerability is a feature, not a bug. The Timeless Child revelations contrast her vulnerability with her most Godlike mythology. The Doctor really is a God now - and she hates it. It's a source of trauma rather than truimph. And, in the end, like Ruth says, it doesn't matter. Because S11 showed that even the most powerful being in history is at the mercy of history itself. No time lord, however powerful, is above time itself. 

Considering the quality of the historicals in chibnall's era over other episodes, I'm amazed these themes haven't been discussed before - or would be, if the crit of the show as it stands wasn't almost entirely negative from the fanbase."

suggestmeabook,fnveqj3,t1_fnvehru,1587290527.0,"There's been a surprisingly large amount of them from people like me, and I'm going to try read through all the less fanficy looking ones. I did! And loved it :)"
books,fnv748e,t1_fnv5ze6,1587282528.0,and all good ones! Nice genre variety too :)
gallifrey,fnr3s4j,t1_fnpd14i,1587178597.0,"Apparently it was a hell of an episode to work on, first being wittled down from a 2 parter to a stand alone and THEN the central villain's actor was apparently a legendary arse on set, so most of his material had to be scrapped - which you can see from the barely 2 lines that he's given."
doctorwho,fnold2a,t1_fnocp57,1587128198.0,"what really annoyed me is a friend who said s11 was a breath of fresh air when they watched it as it aired - and now harbours a jokey but genuine dislike of the era? Opinions change, but a 180 like that seems a bit false at least."
doctorwho,fnol7h5,t1_fnocp57,1587128088.0,"If someone disliked the show but also provided counterarguments of why others liked it, or what was done well, even if only in a passing nod, that seems like more worthy discussion than relentless negativity. I was going to write a positive spin on the timeless child (which I don't like that much myself) that draws on chibnall's themes here but I know I'd likely get crickets or derision. But honestly I've very rarely heard anyone even facetiously admit to liking this era."
doctorwho,fnnr9xa,t1_fnl25j9,1587099439.0,I think they're both about equal and both belong in the 'good' tier of doctor who series. And for that popular fandom dictates I should be shot XD
doctorwho,fnnqjo1,t1_fnnavd9,1587098874.0,"Plus most of the time if you admit to liking this era other fans will treat you like a lobotomised puppy...''there, there, it's not your fault you don't know you're stupid...''"
