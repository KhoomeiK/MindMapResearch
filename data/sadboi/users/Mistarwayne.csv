This probly was mentioned already but from what Iâ€™ve gathered it has a lot to do with just time management . It is more efficient for nurses to oversee patients for extended periods of time before a change due to the massive amounts of data (medications, medical history, etc.) that any one patient may have. 

Think about it: any job more or less feels like there is not enough time in the day, so medical staff is essentially mandated longer shifts to have less turnover ...
