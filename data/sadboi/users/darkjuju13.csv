Petloss,f8q7hfi,t3_e1f6ua,1574713312.0,"Hi there. I recently lost my dog to lumphoma too. She was 11 years old. She was diagnosed in June and we had to put her down in October. It was a horrible feeling when we put her down. I remember seeing her little face and hung her as it happened. I cried and sobbed for days.. and I felt horrible about having taken the decision, but the more I thought about the pain she was in... And how it hurt her to breathe and to be present I realized it was the best thing I could do for her. 

You did the best you could. You gave your pup the best quality of life possible. And you have them as much love as you could. Had you not made this selfless and difficult choice your pup would have suffered much more, and it would have hurt you both to have to witness even more complications unravel. The right choices are never easy. Know that you did what you could out of love and you did everything that was humanly possible. 

It took me a while to understand what happened. And even right now it is still hard for me to not see my dog around, but I know that I did what I could. And I know that I will always love her
 

Sending you much love my friend"
Petloss,f797h7m,t1_f797af5,1573503651.0,Lol aw man! See!! That means you did the right thing!!
Petloss,f796awe,t1_f795fzg,1573503197.0,I don't think it's silly. It's the way you are respecting his spirit and his wishes. You cared for him and you will always love him and it shows. I'm sorry for your loss. Just know your a great owner and friend.
Petloss,f794z9o,t3_duxndw,1573502676.0,Exact same thing happened to me last week. I feel you. It's comforting knowing that you can bring them home again.
Petloss,f6uevru,t1_f6u76pj,1573161952.0,Thank you so much for your kind words. They really mean a lot to me.
Petloss,f5c2swt,t3_dn9ezc,1572129578.0,I'm sorry for your loss. I understand how you feel very well. my baby of 11 years also passed yesterday... she had cancer as well. they're not in pain anymore. Sending you hugs.
Petloss,f5bzyx3,t3_dnclxm,1572128392.0,"I understand you very well. I'm so sorry for your loss. My 11 year old dog passed yesterday... She suffered from lymphoma (a type of aggressive cancer) which spread throughout her whole body. She's been my dog since i was 14, im 25 now. She was the companion to my first dog i had which we got when i was 4. Its a hard process, but just know that you have done all you could to give them the love you had. Dog's are little angels that are sent to us to protect us and bring us joy for a while, but there comes a time when they have to go back to heaven. Take time to process your loss, but know that you furbaby knows you loved him very much."
depression,f5bxxh3,t3_dnhmyt,1572127579.0,"You're not the only one, I know that I feel similar to that at times. I know for me it almost feels like my body oversleeps and it has to try to return to that cycle again... So you're not alone... but i mean for me my depression symptoms change a lot... there were some weeks when i would sleep alot... there were some weeks were i ate a lot... and im currently in a cycle where i barely eat...  Its... i guess a matter of trying to take things one day at a time.."
Petloss,f4yuacz,t3_d8psfk,1571885473.0,"I understand how you felt, my current dog was diagnosed with lymphoma. I've been lucky because the diagnosis was in July... And I have her up until today except... She's been recently slowing down ... and she starting to seem uncomfortable... I'm on the verge of making the decision myself as go weather waiting a couple more days and see how she feels... Or helping her cross the rainbow bridge..."
depression,f3xtww4,t1_f3xr9s2,1571243799.0,I'm here for you. You got this.
Pets,f3w0zzn,t3_dia9ov,1571189431.0,"its best if you ask your mom... the worst is taht she rejects you, if you can ask a friend to take care of your dog in the mean time that might be a good option. i wish you the best."
depression,f3vxryi,t3_di83t8,1571187260.0,take it a few steps at a time. There is always something to live for. As difficult as it may be. remember you are here for a reason. There's something in this world you are meant to do... even ifi it means helping others who may be in a similar situation in the future. dont give up.
miracles,f3us6bs,t3_dbduc0,1571166682.0,I think it was your papa trying to comfort you in some way. The universe works in mysterious ways.
Petloss,f3lyojt,t3_dh327c,1570980853.0,"I'm sorry for your loss. You did what you could and even though your time with him was very short you have him as best of a life as a dog could want.  Know that you did the best you could and you tried to give him a better life. Take time to heal, but be assured you did what you could. Sending a hug your way."
depression,f3h736m,t3_dgwjwi,1570919785.0,"Happy birthday, I understand. I don't like really going out or doing big things on my birthday... But it's ok to celebrate on your own. Remember it's a day when people want to celebrate you because they care about you."
depression,f3h6kqx,t3_dgz28p,1570919669.0,"I understand well... In an attempt to get out of this loop I've started to really fall back on my faith... I've looked for help and have been leveled recently. I found a therapist that has helped me... And I'm currently on anti depressants ... I'm trying to be thankful and believe in my spiritually. It's hard tho coming from a scientific career and training... It's a battle trying to find happiness, but we can do it ... When I'm ready to give up i think.... What kind of person would I like there to look up to .... And I try to step into the role of the person I wish there was... I try to make it my purpose to help others, so I live to make my dogs happy... And to try to make a difference in little ways, weather it's opening the doors for others, helping someone who is stuck, etc. I still feel stuck from time to time however...but... I like to believe we're here for a purpose ... And when we accomplish that we move on to the next thing. I hope this brings you a little light or comfort in your current state."
Petloss,f37su15,t3_dfy8l3,1570729844.0,It past of the healing process. When we lost my first dog we had a hard time thinking of getting another dog... But after a while we were ready to rescue another dog again and give another little critter all the love we could give them and provide them with a second chance.
depression,f34pyt3,t3_dfl5xq,1570657964.0,"way to go! keep taking those little steps to get there. its tough, but taking it one step at a time will get you there <3 sending good vibes your way."
AskVet,f34fud9,t3_dfj2jt,1570653732.0,"Hi, I'm really sorry that she's going through this... its a good idea to ask these questions to the vet she is going to see. asking them those questions and preparing more questions like that on a piece of paper will help your friend get the best advice for the situation. I know when I don;'t know what to say my fiancee helps me out because he has a clearer mindset when we go to the vet to ask the hard questions, but if you have a clearer mindset atm it might help your friend the most to write down questions like those so that she can ask the vet when she is there. You could also try to do a gofundme in regards to the costs. Wishing you the best of luck <3"
Petloss,f31x4m1,t3_df4aby,1570587118.0,I'm so sorry to hear this. Know that you gave that pet the best life you possibly could. You did what you could and you made her happy and that's what matters the most. I'm sure she's doing much better now in pet heaven and watching over you like the angel she was and continues to be. Sending you a big hug.
Petloss,f2dcsfg,t3_dcu2cw,1570150859.0,"I'm sorry to hear this and I'm sorry for your loss. I lost my dog a few years ago... and currently, her companion is heading that way too. She was diagnosed with Lymphoma in July... so when I see her I feel sad to know that something is hurting her. Back when my dog passed away I remember how horrible it was to lose her. Up to this day, I still cry every now and then about it. She was 13 when we had to put her to sleep, but I know she's ok now. It took me a long time to function, but little by little it got a bit easier. I wrote about her in my journal and painted her. I also surprisingly would dream about her a lot. It was in one of those dreams where I swear to this day she came and let me know she was alright. It not easy, but you did what you could. Know you're not alone, and that you provided your pet with the best life you could. When I was going through the grieving process It also helped me think that they must have felt more at peace knowing you were there at the end and they weren't alone. They know how much we care for them, and they're little angels. We get them for a short time because they are such pure and loving creatures that I like to believe they have to go back sooner.  I know its not your typical response, but these are the ways I processed my loss. There's no right or wrong way, and it's ok."
depression,f28m106,t3_dcb40b,1570064965.0,"It's good to hear that you listened to that inside voice. When I'm in a dark situation like that I remind myself that were here for a reason... And there must be a purpose why we were brought here. Maybe its to help others with our story... Or to guide other who are lost, there is always something. Way to go. You got this. <3"
MentalHealthSupport,f1g4r3q,t3_d80eeo,1569459902.0,"I understand how you feel.ive been struggling with depression and feel the same way. There are thing that will trigger me and I'll just cry. I put on a fake front of being bubbly and smiley a lot but there are times when my emotions that I try to put in the back burner spill over. 
I've been through some real eye opening shit recently tho, and have been trying my hardest to take it one day at a time. It helps me if I say outloud things I'm thankful for. I know it sounds weird but it really helps you change your perspective and feel better when you see what things are going ok. 
I literally just finished crying. I feel you too."
