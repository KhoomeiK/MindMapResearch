There wouldn’t be a discussion on if I should have it or not. The craving would be acknowledged and dealt with.  Either with extreme portion control or as low cal/low carb as possible. Sometimes just knowing it is in the freezer is enough and I end up not eating it. There is a half pint of halo top in my freezer that has been there for weeks. 

we are human. Food cravings are going to happen. Food is going to happen. We are going to eat. The question is do we deal with it in an emotionaly healthy way or do we have to go into secretive negative eating patterns.

keto,fkk3zge,t3_fizsrv,1584272545.0,"Test strips are unreliable. They only show the excess ketones you overproduced and are spilling out in urine. Overtime the body will fine tune and only produce the ketones you need and as a result test strips eventually show nothing. 

if you are staying under 20 grams of net carbs a day it takes maybe 24-48 hrs to enter into ketosis. maintaining that 20 grams or less guarantees you will stay in ketosis. Some people can eat slightly higher but it is very individual and the only way to know is blood tests. Again the body stops making excess ketones and you stop spilling them in your urine. 

make sure you are weighing, measuring, and logging everything that enters your mouth. Condiments are a easy place to miss carbs. 

also use more than the scale to judge your progress. Is your fasting glucose changing? Is your blood pressure changing? Take those dreaded pictures in your underwear or swimsuit. Not to show the world but so when the scale doesn’t move you can take a second set and compare. Is there changes? Get out a tape measure and record your measurements. When the scale doesn’t move retake them and see if there are changes. 

I use Cronometer to log everything that enters my mouth all the way to water and sugar free cough drops. 

If I have a stall, I can look back and see what I was doing when my weight was moving. We eventually get comfortable and slack. one thing I was able to find is my weight moves when I eat more salt. I made a post about it a few weeks ago. 

I also use the Remeasure app to log my measurements. It has a body and shows you where to measure. It also allows you to add more measurements if you want to track something else. 

I didn’t take undie pictures until I was down 30 lbs from my highest weight. Highest was 283. Pics were at 253 and only because I joined  /r/btfc and needed them for the competition.
