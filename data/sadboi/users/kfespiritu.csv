What‚Äôs going to happen for all the courses that will be transitioning into online format for the first time?

Highly recommend going when the classes are in person as opposed to online especially if you have difficulty getting yourself to do work at home. We have an office so at least I can compartmentalize but not everyone is as lucky. Doing school at home is difficult because your mind associates your home with rest and relaxation."

My grandma passed away this Wednesday at hospice. I made sure I did everything in my power to make her feel comfortable. Brought in lots of treats, asked her a bunch of questions to get to know her more, and anything else she needed.
