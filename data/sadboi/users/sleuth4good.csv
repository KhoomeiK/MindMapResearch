Broadway,fqezj3l,t1_fqez9ts,1589316200.0,"Trust me, I understand this. I have seen it happen as recent as last year in a production of Evita and Sister Act in my town. I’m talking paid gigs, which they were suggesting to to get by. You’re not going to be paid doing anything but regional or professional unless you have some loaded community theatre’s around."
Broadway,fqefm51,t1_fqeewdg,1589306747.0,"It truly isn’t, because today in 2020 I don’t know of many paying companies that will willingly cast a white person as a POC role. They do these shows with people in mind or with the knowledge that they have the people to fill the roles. The potential consequence and backlash is too likely. These are not the gigs that they would be able to find to “get by” on."
Broadway,fqe2wv1,t1_fqdo80q,1589300877.0,"I understand what you’re getting at, and of course there are some cases where I agree, but that is only when the show does not depend upon a certain understanding of culture and the human experience as a race other than White-American in this country or elsewhere. Frozen does not center around race or a certain culture. Shows like Once on this Island, In the Heights, The Color Purple, Miss Saigon. etc. should not be done without those who can tell these stories truthfully. There was, and still is, lots of uproar about Jonathan Pryce as The Engineer. Times have changed since then. Just like how we don’t cast White-American women in professional productions of Evita as Eva anymore! These changes are good!"

So no, I’m sorry, I don’t agree with your point. It is not enough to talk about these things anymore, we have to act on our words. I don’t agree with any white person with knowledge of In the Heights or The Color Purple or whatever it may be going in for an audition, no matter how much they may need work."

I will probably get downvoted for this, but I cannot be a bystander and watch an insanely talented young woman be torn to shreds everyday. broadway actors don’t owe you anything but what they do on the stage. what she chooses to do with her personal life, career, etc. is none! of! your! business! i encourage all of you to, before you say another thing about *anyone*, think about how you would feel if the next day you learned that said person harmed themselves or passed away due to your comments. it’s real. it happens. wake up & spread love."

I feel like Doug Carter is constantly experiencing PTSD due to this case, you can hear it in his voice. He is completely scatterbrained in interviews and who can blame him? What he has had to see and hear and ruminate on for several years is disturbing as it gets. I think the only way this’ll get solved now is if there is an abundance of outside help e.g. FBI. Also, sources like Billy Jensen & Paul Holes & what HLN is doing is great. This case haunts me more than any other. My heart aches for everyone involved. 💔"
