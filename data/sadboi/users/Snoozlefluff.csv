I don't care if you think I'm a fascist, I can understand you need to give me a place considering there's no room for anything inbetween. I just think it's retarded and when I see you guys fight each other it gives me a feeling of detachment, like two hungry wolves eating each other while the rest of the world just tries to get on with their lives. You lost your claim at a moral high ground the moment you justified unprovoked violence, considering you apply it selectively and obviously don't oppose all idiologies that ever resulted into genocide or you'd be anticommunist as well."
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,foxamto,t1_foxabda,1588138396.0,"I understand that but you're comparing apples to oranges here. Antifa is by definition counter-reactionary while Fascism is a well defined ideology with, as you yourself indicated, a long and concrete history. I think the main issue with Antifa is their contemporary methods of silencing opposition voices with violence and using methods reminiscent to those that the Nazis used when they started emerging. 

Nobody's claiming that Antifa caused genocide in the past, and arguing that is a typical strawman."
