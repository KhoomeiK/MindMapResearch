I’ll fight for hours until I decide to either watch YouTube videos for a hour or play some guitar. (Playing guitar is the best for me it topically breaks with the thought process and changes the behaviour even if I just pick it up and play for 15 mins the importance for me is breaking the thought process and just chill). Keep in mind that I have been battling general anxiety disorder for years and I am now in control of most of it (meaning it’s been a long time since I had a panic attack) the lock down is not being so great for it, although working from home helps a lot to keep my mind occupied I constantly worry about how it will be to get back to the routine and going outside (another thing most of us battle at some point). Keep on rocking I guess that’s my advise. And stay safe and positive. Thanks for sharing, I love reading this subreddit! Literally the experiences narrated in some post are so relatable ( and helps bringing a face to this monster, like it’s not just me.)."
