stopdrinking,ff1v9hk,t3_er5kpu,1579486951.0,"I just moved back in w my parents at 28 (unrelated to drinking, it is a temporary situation due to a breakup but anyway...) it has me thinking a lot about my drinking and when it began and what I was like the last time I lived here. 

I knew I loved alcohol the first time I tried it. And since the first time I tried it, I never had a healthy relationship with it. The first time I drank till I puked I was just 13. From there I began stealing what I could from my parents. Eventually around 16 I made friends with people who were of age so I had a never-ending supply of alcohol. 

I ditched all my real friends for these people. I chose partying over meaningful friendships. I still have never recovered from this. I don't know how to form meaningful relationships without alcohol or some kind of substance involved. 

I look around at most people my age and they have lifelong friends or at least still a lot of friends from high school bc they had normal friendships. I, on the other hand, have no friends left. Because our friendships were not based on trust, love, etc. They were based on getting fucked up. And any real friends I met through partying, I have destroyed those relationships with my actions while being inebriated. 

I thought drinking made me more social, but I look around now and have no friends. 

I spent most of my youth being the girl that was high and/or drunk. That became my identity. Now I'm almost 30 trying to figure out who I actually am. Trying to find hobbies and passions is so hard being older. It makes you feel dumb trying new things bc you never had practice trying anything except drugs. It's extremely intimidating. 

I wish I spent my high school years working on and discovering myself. I think maybe I would be a more confident person if I had done that. I know I would have more meaningful friendships and more success had I avoided alcohol and drugs in the first place. 

I promise you don't want to be almost 30 still trying to get a degree and figure out who you are. Drinking will take you there and worse. I'm lucky I never killed anyone or myself or didn't get a DUI. It is honestly a miracle none of that happened. 

One thing I learned in recovery is not taking that first drink or drug is all it takes to get better. If I had any advice to give to my younger self it would be not to ever even touch the alcohol, cigarettes, or weed. Bc years later I would be struggling and fighting everyday with those addictions. Those addictions would lead me to do so many embarrassing, immoral, and idiotic things I can't even count. 

None of it was worth it in the end. I feel like I just wasted years of my life. 

If you try a substance and immediately love it, then that's a warning sign right there. I wish I had known sooner that my love of getting messed up wasnt ""normal and fun"" partying. It was the beginning of addiction. 

By most standards I am a ""normal"" person, you would probably not peg me as an alcoholic without personally knowing me. Don't look at addiction and think ""that will never be me"" bc it can happen to anybody when you go messing with an addictive substance. 

Idk if this will be helpful for you, but it's my experience."
