I thought if I selected ""hidden"" it would allow only those with the link to see it. Do you know a way to post it so only those with a link can see?"
femalehairadvice,fni51eb,t3_g1wx7n,1586974099.0,"Thanks for taking the time to help me out! I have suffered from mental illness for the past few years and stopped caring for myself properly. I've recently graduated college and found employment in my field (something I never thought I'd be able to do, so proud of myself üòä). I've been trying to learn to love myself again, and I want to treat myself to a new haircut once this whole Coronavirus situation has settled. Problem is, I do not even know where to begin! 

I've been doing some research and I believe I may have a square/round face. My hair is naturally curly with frizz, so I'm willing to use heated styling tools (I used to enjoy straightening my hair in highschool). My hair currently is just a straight cut a few inches past my shoulders.

Ps. Don't mind the lippy, I was trying to play with colors as I haven't worn makeup in a long time.

TrollGC,fkl3uod,t3_fj4lt4,1584297901.0,"Feminism, not womanism. Females, not ""women."" We stand together against sexism and not genderism. If they want to unite and make a transgendered related rights group, all the power to them! But they are not entitled to hijack a movement based on sex, then demand everyone pretend the thing the movement stood for (female sex) not exist. They are also not entitled to strip females of their rights they fought for like sex segregation of vulnerable spaces & public washrooms. Should transgendered individuals feel unsafe in public washrooms with the cisgendered population, then they should fight for their right to segregate and not demand females be stripped of theirs. Rant over."
