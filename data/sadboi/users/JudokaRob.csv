Your points are definitely taken, and I wholeheartedly agree, but that also assumes that the majority of combat athletes hav enough knowledge to put together an impactful training regimen. 

5/3/1, Juggernaut, and Etc. tend to use fixed %-rep schemes, which is what most people would gravitate towards since they aren't able or willing to make the investment into customizable programs. 

To touch on your point about honing RPE the caveat is that people could also misjudge the RPE and end up working with a higher workload than they otherwise would if they used percentages and tank their recovery even more."
bjj,fk1cr5h,t1_fk16tos,1583777018.0,"Thank you for the well thought out response and a confirmation of some of my thoughts!

I've looked at RTS in the past and it's great stuff, but you've given me more to think about in terms of bar speed. 

Overall my plan was to negate bar speed and instead of using straight sets use ramping sets pyramiding to the point where I reach what I consider to be RPE 8 without a fatigue %. 

I'm strictly judging my RPE based on how many reps I believe I had left in the tank at the time. 

So for example, High Bar Squats the other day. I'm coming off a knee injury and haven't squatted over 3 plates in years, so I went in working up to a set of 245 at RPE 8 with 2 clean reps left in the tank. However, after that set I judged it to be RPE 6, at which point I would continue at that wait until I reach RPE 8 or increase the weight."

I’ve run 5/3/1 to great effect prior to Jiu-Jitsu, but I severely question using fixed %’s as it seems like a quick way to plateau if you have a heavy training schedule.

For example, I might add an extra day of training or go for a run, which could impact my ability to hit my prescribed lifts, but under RPE I could adjust my workload to accommodate the additional training session.

My current mindset is I don’t need to be at my strongest for my jiujitsu to benefit; I just have to be strong enough."
