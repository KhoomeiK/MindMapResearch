also same. I don’t want to repeat my year, I don’t want to fail. I just can’t find the motivation to actually try and not fail. All I can do is sit there and stare at my increasing number of missing assignments and dread the day when they finally call my parents ✨✨"
depression,fpmqj8r,t1_fpmh2bb,1588739118.0,I’m in the same situation. I literally get about 30 minutes of work in a day. I’ve just given up on my electives because of how long it takes me to finish the weeks academic class assignments. My creativity and motivation are completely gone at this point. Honestly never imagined that I’d be failing ART AND ACTING. but here we are😃👍
depression,fpmq5j1,t1_fpmb433,1588738851.0,"Same. all my teachers are like “please email me if you’re struggling I care!” And hell, I am struggling. I’m missing almost everything and I’m so lost and overwhelmed. But I’ve been using my mental health as an excuse so much this year since I’ve really just been struggling so much and I always tell them that’s the reason I’m missing things. Now I feel like they wouldn’t even believe me since “but it’s so stress free at home! You have so much more time😃”"

depression,fpmp22k,t1_fplgvp4,1588738075.0,"I’m switched to P/NP too, and even though I’m in high school  I’m kind of in the same boat. I wake up too late pretty much every day to take my adderall and my antidepressant so I’ve just been living without them and I can’t sit in front of my work for more than half an hour without either breaking down crying or going and doing something else for the rest of the day. It’s crazy how even with p/np students who had good grades before are struggling to even PASS. 

I can’t relate to graduation, since I’m a sophomore, but the rest of the year was supposed to be a turning point for me art wise, since that’s what I want to go to college for. I spent the entire year bsing projects for the grade since I couldn’t find my inspiration. My art teacher finally went off at me about how I never do anything the week before quarantine. I promised her I’d do better and I tried my best. Finally started finding it, and boom, this happens and my everything just spiraled. I’m too overwhelmed with all my other classes to draw at all and Now im failing both my advanced art classes and I feel like my dream of going to art  is just drifting away more and more every day.

I’m just waiting for my art teacher to tell me she’s done with me at this point because I give up. I just want a break to get myself together but it never stops anymore. The work literally never stops :( at least in real class we could somewhat have weekends to look forward to.."
depression,fpmnmj6,t3_gdv7qt,1588737111.0,The fact that I and both of my siblings (who are in middle school) had decent grades and did our homework before the closure and now are all missing like every other assignment and failing half our classes really fucking says something about how absolutely shitty this system is.
depression,fpmmr2u,t1_fpklvgn,1588736543.0,God same with me with the art thing. I have a ZERO percent in one of my two art classes and a 60 in the other. I can’t do two advanced and fast paced art classes while having to do packets of chemistry and math every week and doing tons of actinf projects. The lack of motivation and just being told “ok do this project now and then do this project and then do this” had just made all my creativity seep away. I considered bsing the art but decided to just not turn anything in instead of turn in shitty work with no passion.
depression,fpmmb3h,t3_gdv7qt,1588736251.0,"I’m a sophomore in high school and before quarantine I was finally starting to gain more motivation in my art classes which is supposed to be my future career.

Then school got cancelled and I haven’t had any motivation to do anything creative since because everything has gotten so overwhelming. I was doing well and actually starting to do some decent pieces in school before and now I’m just dead.

I’m failing art now because I can’t get anything in. I haven’t turned in a single thing. I’m failing the art program at my school I got into by audition because I haven’t turned anything in. This was supposed to be my future and I don’t know what to do anymore"

He said to take half a pill a day for the first week and if no side effects happen then to up the dose to a full pill a day, and then come in for a follow up next month, and my mom agreed that it sounded reasonable. I’m going to take it for the first time tonight, so hopefully all goes well!"

highschool,eqyrys4,t3_bvr765,1560388438.0,"(I just saw another post with the same question that I typed this answer for so I’m just gonna paste it here)

I’m actually two days away from finishing my freshman year :,) So here’s what I’ve learned this year:

Get involved as much and as soon as possible! Try out for a play or join a sport or a club?  I didn’t get involved at ALL this year due to being shy and I honestly really regret it, everyone I know who has gotten involved this year found it much easier than me to connect with other students with similar interests and make friends than I did.

DO NOT PROCRASTINATE. The increased rigor of high school classes vs middle school literally hit me like a wave, considering that I used to do my homework at 10pm every night after lying around for 6 hours. It unfortunately won’t work anymore, especially if you’re planning to have other commitments. I’m honestly being kind of hypocritical because I’m not completely out of the habit of torturing myself like that yet but... if you do your homework early and get to sleep earlier your life will be SO much easier.

Get friendly with a lot of upperclassmen! During the first couple months I was COMPLETELY lost but I met some nice juniors and seniors that gave me advice on classes, teachers, tests, and helped me with homework I didn’t understand because they had already taken that class. They can literally be lifesavers lol.

Also, try to put yourself out there and meet a lot of people. I’m still working on this as well but high school will be so much easier when you know other people are suffering with you mdkdnd

Also this doesn’t really apply too much freshman year but don’t overload yourself with honors classes/ APS in later years unless you genuinely enjoy the subject, there really isn’t any point. Don’t make it harder than it needs to be! Just do what you KNOW you’re comfortable with.

Anyway that’s all I can think of at the moment, I’ll add on if I can think of anything else :)

Good luck next year!

High school can actually be pretty fun if you let it be!"
