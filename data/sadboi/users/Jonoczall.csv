**Short answer / TL;DR :** **I've slept with many of my friends. No regrets. When approached with honesty it can be a really fulfilling experience. I'm still friends with all of my partners. In fact, I ended up marrying the friend I lost my virginity to a decade later. Our close friendship is the base of our love for each other. I got lucky.**

**Long answer:** Sleeping with friends is amazing (if you know what you're doing). Here's my story and takeaways.

*But first let's establish a few things:*

• I love women. Not in a thirsty disrespectful way, nor in a neckbeard *m'lady* sort of way. I just think women's bodies are amazing, and I personally always find something special that I can appreciate in most women I come in contact with. I also just like being around them. Something about the oestrogen in the vicinity balances me out. 

• I have a high sex drive. Maybe I have some issues? But I simply love sex. It's the spice of life for me tbh. 

• I'm a quality over quantity kind of guy.

**Part 1 - Coming of age**

*(This sets the context for part 2. Scroll down if you don't want to read)*

I was an awkward kid growing up. Thanks to some serious health issues during my early childhood, I never had the opportunity to partake in sports or extracurricular activities that would allow me to meet girls. Going to an all-boys Catholic secondary school didn't help things either. In my country we have a huge exam that everyone has to write at the end of high school. It's normal then for students to do additional private prep classes in their chosen subjects. This is where I first started interacting with the opposite sex. 

16 year old me had this crazy idea that if I wanted to get girls, I had to understand them. What's the best way to do that? *""Befriend all of them!""* I thought. And I meant genuinely befriend them; not pretending to be their friends so I can get into their pants. I took the time to learn how to be comfortable around attractive girls; making them laugh; getting them to open up, and just building friendships in general.

Of course this wasn't a straight forward process, and of course naïve little me was ""friendzoned"" numerous times. But that's okay because those experiences are what later shaped me later on.

Fast forward to 21. I was now ridiculously comfortable around women. I became a naturally flirty guy (within reason). I dated, had a few hook-ups of the sexual kind **however...** I was still a virgin. This was by choice. I was raised in a very Christian home and that of course coloured my views on sex. I started off as *nO sEX b4 maRRiAgE!*, and by my 20s I was thinking okay maybe I can lose it to someone who's of value to me. 

In my late teens I met my future wife, Rebecca. We instantly clicked, became fast friends and spoke daily. This continued even though she moved back to her country of origin. Despite the distance she was still one of my closest friends. We used to call each other *""bro and sis""* (inb4 porn plot jokes). She'd visit my country a few times a year since she still had a lot of friends and family here. She knew every detail of my dating life and my baby steps into debauchery. In the Christmas of 2013, after a night out clubbing with friends and an unhealthy amount of alcohol we made out. A few days later approaching NYE the sexual tension kept building until finally while spending NY's week at a beach house with friends, we decided why not just lose my virginity to my sister. I was glad I lost it to her and not any of the other girls I met before. It was a *""safe space""* for awkward af moments and practice with a friend.

**Story 2 - A New Norm**

After swiping my Vcard with Rebecca I began exploring my sexuality. I learned a few things about myself quickly. 

• I was very good at separating the physical from the emotional. For me sex was just an amazing human experience that I enjoyed with women.

• Random hookups weren't my kind of thing. Don't get me wrong, I'd never pass up a free plate of food. But I preferred consistency and quality over variety. 

Remember, up to this point little adolescent me, after submerging myself in groups of women, I really grew a skill at befriending them. I had a lot of female friends. They'd always introduce me to their girlfriends. I kept it chill and befriended everyone. Slowly I grew a reputation of being that chill af fun guy you could let your guard around, ask for life/boy advice from, and not have to worry about being creepy with you. I had become the *Straight-Gay-Best-Friend*. 

Some of these friends responded to my hints and playful flirty cues. They trusted me and felt very comfortable around me. Sometimes it stopped at *remember that one night we made out? tee-hee🤭*. Other times it went all the way to sex. Slowly my reputation grew further as being *that guy you could have a safe fun time with and doesn't treat you like shit*. And I was always upfront, honest, and vocal on my position beforehand, that I just liked sex and female energy. I never pressured anybody, and I'd always respect and decision to move back to complete platonic friends.

**So what was the end result of all this?**

1) I had regular partners. I didn't have to regularly go and hunt for someone new. 

2) I started getting more lays in general. You know what attracts women? Other women. Having female friends around me who I had a closeness with telegraphed legitimacy to others in my environment.

3) I started getting direct referrals. A friend I used to hookup with (we had to end the hookups because life stuff happened), recommend me to one of our mutual friends, Sarah, a year later. Never in a million years did it even cross my mind that we'd be compatible. I was friends with Sarah's family and we'd hike regularly etc. She turned out to be one of my best FWB to date.

3) The comfort that comes with it being someone you know. There's an extra wholesome layer to the fun to be had when you actually like the personality of the person you're sleeping with.

4) I became *""Ole' Faithful""*. Some friends hooked up with me over the span of years. They'll always check back. Some were in a busy period of their life and not ready for a relationship. Some were in between relationships and didn't want to have to deal with the headache of finding a rebound. Others might be passing through the country for a time. Etc

**5) One of them, my closest friend, became my wife. I wouldn't have the amazing marriage I have now had we not had friendship at the base.**

Yea so that's my experience.
