The most unexpected bretayal could lead to built entire worlds inside your head that you don't even realize consciously. If you are an insecure person or struggle with anxiety (Or even if you don't) stressful trauma that alters completely the view of the world that your brain has kept for long time, could find its way through by assuming, for example, repulsion to close relationships, behavior related to them, like sex, insecure thoughts about your own body, not feeling capable of feeling o giving any plaseaure or that you couldn't simple enjoy sex because it envolvs strong feelings of attachment for you.
This happens a lot, I've known many people struggling with anorgasmy, erectile disfunction or insecureness of every kind towards sex."

You can allways help yourself as you help your ill heart or kidney by eating better or exercising."
