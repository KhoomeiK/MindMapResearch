relationship_advice,f801960,t1_f7zkezq,1574119316.0,"          I stopped trying to use happiness as a reason to improve. I started motivating myself with the presumption “I will be worse off if I don’t”. I feel like shit sometimes, but less so when I’ve done something to improve. I’ve accomplished more in the past year on dealing with the problems of not changing than I did when I was chasing a good feeling. If saving money, losing weight, getting up early, improving oneself only produced good feelings we’d be addicted to going to the gym, not our smartphones. 
           I know it’s not that inspiring, we always want the positives, but sometimes not dealing with the negatives is more motivating and better for you. If you learn to love the process of change itself you won’t be weighed down by the goals.  
            I stopped getting a running high from the machines at the gym, however I didn’t stop. I knew if I didn’t change and lose weight I’d feel like shit. So I lost 25% of my body mass in a year. I knew I had stop getting up at 11:00 AM every day (I was still tired even then). I was miserable learning how to do it (I should have taken smaller steps instead of jumping directly from 11:00 to 6:15). I wasn’t happy for a long time but now I wake up at 5:30 every day no problem. I feel less tired waking up at 5:30 everyday then I did waking up at 11:00 AM."
