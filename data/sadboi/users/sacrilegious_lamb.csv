Fate,ffx0ggg,t1_ffw68e9,1580315091.0,"Back when I was first figuring out how to watch it, I stumbled upon this thread and decided to effectively go chronological order and skip Fate/stay night (2006) by Studio Deen, based on their recommendation, and I thoroughly enjoyed what felt like a solid experience.

https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/an7u1r/what_order_do_i_watch_the_fate_series_in/

I mean, Studio Deen's adaptation isn't known for its [spectacular writing](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/001/593/peopledie.jpg)"
Fate,ffwz2e5,t1_ffw6703,1580314222.0,"I wouldn't recommend putting Zero off until that late, either before UBW or after UBW at the latest (the third heavens feel movie isnt even out yet btw)

Zero gives good context to many of the character relationships in UBW that arent spoilery because they simply just aren't explained/revealed through UBW or Heaven's Feel.

Also I forgot to mention that UBW first would spoil not only the ending of Zero, but also a few other really impactful moments in Zero, making them kinda lose the power they have. Conversely, watching Zero first would give just enough context to the events of UBW, making them feel more impactful than they would have otherwise without that context, but not in a way that spoils the experience, imo—the way things are revealed in Zero is way more impressive and impactful than the way the same things are revealed in UBW, imo.

Like I was saying, UBW before Zero is a valid watch option as well, but if you're trying to aim for the best first experience, I highly recommend watching Zero before UBW, and skipping anything by Studio Deen until you're already a bigger fan of the series from watching the first two and wish to go back to it."
Fate,ffuk80g,t1_ffu7das,1580243704.0,Yeah it effectively spoils the ending to Zero
Fate,ffuer09,t3_ev8e9a,1580240418.0,"I personally would recommend beginning with Fate/Zero, then Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade Works, then the Heaven's Feel movie trilogy (all by ufotable). I consider Fate/Zero to be a really strong way to start the whole series, and while this watch order may not be the most ""faithful"" to the way the original visual novel is presented, it makes for a really solid experience to get into it.

UBW before Zero is also a valid watch order as well, but imo starting with Zero even makes UBW more powerful. Also, watching Zero first would spoil a minor plot point for UBW, but watching UBW first would spoil the entire ending for Zero, so keep that in mind.

If you want to watch Studio Deen's Fate/stay night then I'd say save it until after, as it's kinda clunky and awkward, and not ideal as an introduction to the series; so don't watch anything Fate by Deen until you finish ufotable's Zero and UBW."
Fate,ffr9vn6,t1_ffr9k0d,1580153611.0,"I haven't seen it yet myself, but it's likely best to watch it after you've finished Zero and UBW."
Fate,ffr9ayc,t1_ffr915i,1580153254.0,which one do you mean?
Fate,ffr86wv,t3_eusnly,1580152561.0,"My personal recommendation is to watch Fate/Zero and then Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade Works, both by ufotable.

IMO they flow really well together, and all the friends I've gotten into it have said they're glad they watched Zero before UBW rather than the other way around. There's a lot of other spinoff shows but I wouldn't really recommend those unless you really wanted to watch them afterwards.

Also there's ufotable's Fate/stay night Heaven's Feel movie trilogy with the third movie coming out soon, watch those after UBW."

I don't mind the other changes, I just want to get rid of friend activity and community content on each game page.
