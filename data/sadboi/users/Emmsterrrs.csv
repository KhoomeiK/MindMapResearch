mentalhealth,fbfpcw1,t1_fafosvz,1576816656.0,"So I had a conversation with my parents a week ago...honestly I feel like nothing has changed, they told me that they don't believe in ""middle school ptsd"", but say that they will get my sister help, my sister just stares at the computer all day, doesn't come out of the room, she even told me that she is hopeless and that not even the school psychiatrist is helping her :("
mentalhealth,fa26b7m,t1_fa1so5i,1575778337.0,"Hey! Thank you so much for commenting this, I'm sorry those jerks bullied you in high school...you are very blessed to have such a sweet little sister,  I'm so glad that you came out of those dark periods, hopefully my sister gets to heal like you some day <3

I was gonna just send her a very long text telling her that we love her and that she needs to talk to my parents and get help, but after what you said I think I'll actually talk to her in person...hopefully it goes well!

Once again thank you so much throawaway, if you ever need someone to talk you you can message me and other redditers (is that how you call it?), I'm still very new here and I don't come here much, but I'll try to be more active"

It was so hard not to stress over it, but I started to relax, sleep more, and took a break from exercising, also eating more than I was for the last few months, I'm back on my weightloss journey again, but this time, I'm gonna make sure to prioritize my health and wellbeing, I know I will reach my goal one day, but health should always come first. :D

Have a nice day!"

My period came back on Saturday, and I'm kind of glad that I started changing my habits right when I noticed my period was a week late, if I didn't pause my weightloss journey and just ignore the lack of period, it would've been worse for the long run...thank you for the advices! I definetly need to be more careful now"
