I haven’t been eating any differently really, the skin problems only started after a little while of being around/touching the cat more. I live in the southeast, in VA if that helps.

My dad has just complained directly to me about not calling him/him not hearing from me often enough as well, and it’s never been anything personal against either of them, I just didn’t feel compelled to do so, nor did I feel like they cared.

As of super recently though, I have been keeping in touch with both of my parents every now & then. Not as often as most people I know do, but still a lot for what I’m used to.

meth,fml2l0q,t3_fvx42o,1586176929.0,"I think you may be right that you are overthinking it in a sense. Like you said, unless you burn your pipe, there shouldn’t be much of a noticeable smell to anyone who doesn’t already know what meth smells like. That’s actually one of my personal favorite things about rolling bowls, I can just do it in my room & chill. Air freshener, a candle, and/or any other scented things are still a good idea to have like you said though.

You could try blowing your smoke into a sploof (Empty TP roll, stuffed with dryer sheets). Generally used for weed, at least when I used to use them, & they would usually work pretty well for that, so I would imagine it would really cover up any smells from meth. Like I said though, personally I feel as though as long as you don’t burn your bowl, even if there is a smell of some sort, it may just be a vague chemical smell, and I don’t think most people’s first instinct would be to assume you’re smoking meth from it. 

Also, if there are air vents, cover them up if possible. That would be the way to prevent the smell from traveling, as well as the crack underneath your door.

TL;DR: You should be good with scented candles, aerosol sprays/cologne, etc. but if you really want to make sure, blowing into a sploof should help."
meth,fma7a6p,t3_fu0wdb,1585885661.0,"This depends person to person entirely. Personally, yes absolutely as long as I don’t have to do any serious socializing, as I’ve noticed my memory and ability to process thoughts/form sentences is pretty trash when mixing bud with Tina. 

Upsides for me however seem to be less anxiety, leveled out heart rate, ability to sleep easier upon usage during comedown, and a more mellowed out high in general. Not so mellow that it reverses the upper effects though. 

Conversely, I know quite a few people who it seems to have the opposite effects for. I’ve heard many say they get more anxious & more high, even heard a few people say it makes them feel “too high”.  So in a nutshell, it varies person to person. Similar to how weed eases/gets rid of anxiety for myself & many other people, there are also many people who get more anxious from smoking bud."

I may smoke as much of the rest of the burnt shit that I can tolerate so as not to waste it in my mind, but after a while it’s just more beneficial IMO to clean it out & start fresh.

I was hallucinating that my friends & I were in hell, so much so that I actually “felt” intense heat, and events that happened would replay themselves, slow down, & suddenly speed up again as if someone had a remote & was manually fast forwarding & rewinding everything. 


The second was my experience with auditory hallucinations. I took quite a few of sleeping pills some years back with the original intent of suicide, although I immediately regretted my decision right after doing so. Not long after, I was hallucinating that my loved ones were talking to me. It felt & sounded SO real, that’s what I remember most. I remember specifically having a full blown conversation with my best friend, we went back & forth like any normal conversation would go, and it wasn’t until I remembered that I had been in my room still the entire time/hadn’t left my house that I pieced together that I was talking to myself but hearing the voice of my best friend so loud & clear that I genuinely felt as though she were in the room with me at that moment. Once the voices of a few family members as well subsided, I attempted to sleep the issue off, but each time I finally got close to falling asleep, I would hear a very loud BANG in my head. Every. single. time. Luckily I was more or less okay when I woke up the next morning."

Advice,fkadiz0,t3_fhd5y6,1584003018.0,"Technically speaking, not necessarily. Herpes can lay dormant for years. However, I wouldn’t freak yourself out about it by any means UNLESS you do in fact get a lesion and/or other symptoms. It’s recommended by doctors that you don’t get tested for herpes specifically because of both the stigma & possible chance of false positives, considering an overwhelming majority of people have apparently come into contact with the herpes virus in one way or another, (whether it be HSV-1 or 2). 

So, unless they have a lesion to swab & do a PCR test on, it’s not worth the mental upset because as I stated earlier, If they do a simple blood test instead of actually swabbing a lesion, you’re much more likely to get a false positive. 

Trust me on this one, from personal experience. I worked myself up about a potential herpes scare sometime last year, even though I was visually checked & cleared, and my doctor advised against getting tested for it unless I had any actual sore/lesions because she said the stigma was worse than the disease itself in the sense that, most people have come into contact with some form of herpes (Think, a cold sore when you were little, etc). & most blood tests aren’t thorough enough to detect a time period in which it may have been transmitted, but people end up psyching themselves out, accusing current or ex-lovers, & etc. I decided to get a blood test anyways, even after my doctors recommendation & was told by a nurse that one came back “positive”. 

I was crushed, & my mental state was extremely low. It got so bad, after I received that reading from the nurse at the office, I began imagining that I had symptoms. I soon went back to my doctor to see about alleviation from those symptoms, at which point she reminded me that I didn’t actually have herpes or an active herpes infection for that matter. That my index score was far too low, & that she had tried to warn me about how likely it was that one or the other would come back positive just considering how common it is to come into contact with in general.

So, my advice to you is to not overthink it like I did & drive yourself crazy. Herpes can lay dormant for a while hypothetically speaking, but if you don’t have any legitimate signs of any lesions specifically, I wouldn’t bother working yourself up about it."

You’ll find there are plenty of cis women interested in trans men, more than you might imagine actually! You may often times have more luck with women that happen to be bisexual just because they tend to sometimes be more open-minded as a whole in many ways, but this is not at all to say that finding an actual straight woman is impossible. They too are out there. I’m stealth personally, but when dating, I do make it a point from the beginning to disclose that I’m trans, basically just to “weed” anyone out that wouldn’t be interested if they knew the truth, and I also personally feel that it’s fair to do. I’ve met some pretty cool straight women over time who honestly don’t mind/treat you any differently than they would any other man. 

Most of my romantic interests do tend to be bisexual as I’ve noted before, but this was also the case for me pre-transition & I believe that is primarily because there just happens to be quite a bit of bisexual women where I live. Don’t give up. You’ll find the right woman when it comes time."

askdrugs,fj6r549,t3_fa4uy4,1583078367.0,"A while back, I tried spice for the first time with a few friends of mine at the time. I took one hit, & things started playing out really weird. Situations would replay themselves over & over again, & I was just in & out of touch with reality. I got to the point where soon, I was convinced my friends & I had actually died (we were in the car, so I assumed we had gotten into a car accident), & went to hell, & it felt super real. I remember feeling really hot, (further contributing to my hell theory) & I truly convinced myself that my friends & I had died & went to hell. 

I was tripping out pretty badly, it’s embarrassing as hell to think of now, but I was screaming bloody murder basically, & at one point I got so paranoid, I tried to hop out of the car window while we were at a stoplight, to see if I was actually alive or truly dead & in hell.

At any rate, that was the only bad trip to date that I have ever experienced on any drug, & it really scared the crap out of me, as I was honestly convinced that we were in hell. I don’t think it’s too uncommon to have hellish like bad trips honestly, I’ve heard other people talk about their bad trips/experiences on other drugs as well as spice, & with spice in specific, I didn’t touch the drug again for about 2 years or so later, but although I never had any more “bad” trips on spice after taking it later, each time I would get high on it, I would totally dissociate from reality & the places I would go to in my mind definitely felt hell-like, if that makes sense. That drug in general as a whole, just reminded me of hell. It was sort of strange, considering I’ve obviously never actually been to hell, so I don’t know how I was immediately so certain of what hell “felt” like enough to compare the feeling to my spice highs,but that’s really the best way I could describe it. 

The very last time I touched spice, I ended up OD’ing & had to get pulled out of a ditch by EMT’s (to my confusion). To this day I still see that drug as almost like a portal to hell."

I love ice, but sometimes if I get too high, my heart rate gets a bit too fast for my liking & I get really hot & shit. But if I roll a bowl of ice, then smoke a bowl or so of bud? Perfect combo for me. 

Brings my heart rate down, mellows out my ice high a tad bit, but not so much that I don’t feel high or anything like that, & bc of the ice, instead of being tired, I’m alert, focused, & often times pretty euphoric.

I also know people who it has the opposite effect for, & for some reason smoking (even the same weed I’m smoking) actually makes them tweak out even more & makes them anxious & shit.

AskReddit,fhxoc73,t3_f5bd7a,1581958803.0,"A couple years back I was working at a local grocery store chain as a cashier & a man, his wife, & a couple of their kids were in my line getting rung up by me. The husband had separate items from the rest of his family for me to ring up. I proceeded to ring up his items, & when I’m more than halfway done, the man tells his family he’s going to be right back.

I had a pretty decent line, & as it was the husbands time to pay, he still hadn’t returned. Considering my line, I couldn’t wait any longer for the man, & opted to put his change on the counter directly in eyesight of both myself,& the man’s family, & proceeded to ring up his family’s items. The guy comes back finally, & sees his money sitting on the counter & totally flips shit.

He starts yelling at me asking why I would put his money on the counter, & telling me how disrespectful it is, & how “anyone” could have taken it. I apologized, & said I did so, because I had a long line & had to continue trying to get the line down, & that the money was clearly in a spot that I could always see, & if anything, his family could as well. He didn’t want to hear any of this & proceeds to cuss me out.

The Kicker: whilst cussing me out, the man (a black man, you will see why this is relevant shortly.) says to me “That’s fucking ridiculous, you know, I bet you if I was a WHITE man you would have put the money in my hands.” 

My first initial thought was: he couldn’t have REALLY just said that...as for one, I MYSELF am black, so his insinuation confused me, & two, he really expected me to wait a good 5 mins AFTER I finished ringing him up to place the money directly in his hands? I get that placing the money on the counter when a customer is directly in front of you is rude as hell, but if you’re not in front of me, there’s nothing I can do. My world does not revolve around you, I have got to cater to these other customers as well. At one point I said “Well, I had my eyes on it the entire time, and your family is right here as well.” The guy is still yelling & cussing me out & the wife finally speaks up & says “You still should have put the money in his hands though...”.

At that point I was BEYOND done, & the looks on the other customers faces’ in line showed me that they were as well. The man asked about my manager, to which I swiftly replied that I would be HAPPY to grab her for him, & I did. My manager at the time was thankfully pretty cool, & overheard the part where he basically accused me of discriminating against him for not being white, & she assured the man she would “handle it” & came over to me a bit later & laughed with me about how ridiculous the guy was, & assured me that I had done nothing wrong. 

This happened some yearsss ago, the grocery chain has since shut down, but I still work a retail job & I often think about this situation & how crazy it was that this guy really expected me to wait for him to come back, and even more so that he tried to insinuate that if he were a “white man” I most definitely would have placed the money in his hands..."
Advice,fhwtu6w,t3_f55ygl,1581929922.0,"Yes. Absolutely. Mental health is top priority, even above work. However, I’m not entirely sure how your employer is, so I personally would be a bit cautious about specifically telling them your exact reasoning behind it. If you feel so bad mentally that you are having break downs & KNOW you need a break, it definitely should be done for your sake, but I would give another, much more vague reasoning for calling out if asked. You would think just stating you need a mental health day would be reason enough, & depending on your employer they may even view it as such. But, some employers don’t see it that way, & basically if you aren’t physically sick or dealing with a loss in the family of similar, they may not see it as reason enough to call out. 

My point is: Yes, you should definitely call out if you feel this bad, but if I were you, I wouldn’t tell them your specific reasoning. Maybe just say you are sick/haven’t been feeling well, & leave it at that. Don’t worry about your employer “hating you” because of it. What’s most important is your health right now. Any reasonable employer won’t flip out for you taking one day off, regardless of its your only day you have scheduled or not. Good luck, hope you feel better soon."

Eventually I tried again because I felt I had to, as T is something I know I want really badly. I got the advice to numb your thigh with ice, & that was the best advice ever honestly. Now, I’m a little over a year in & most of my shots go pretty smoothly with minimal to no pain at all. Try ice guys, it’s a lifesaver for me!

My family can smell bud from a mile away at this point, but I can light bowls of Tina just about anywhere in my house without it smelling like anything at all, both to myself or anyone else.

rant,fgypvx5,t1_fgynyzd,1581185695.0,"It’s not a basic fact. Science (biology) disproves your so called “fact”. I’m sure it might make you temporarily feel better to operate under the delusion that men can have periods, but that just denies basic biology. Men don’t have uteruses, therefore they don’t/can’t get periods. In fact, even trans men on testosterone don’t get periods after a while, so I’m not entirely sure what “men” it is you’re talking about that are able to menstruate, but biological men absolutely can not, ever menstruate, & trans men on hormones do not either. 

I’m not at all disregarding trans people (again, especially being a trans man myself), let alone AMAB NB folk...I’m just telling you how life works.  People already think the entirety of the trans community is comprised of a bunch of delusional nut jobs, denying biology is definitely a big factor in why they think so."

It always bugs me to hear guys make fun of how some chicks look down there, because these exact same guys are the ones who get super sensitive when women comment on ANY guy’s junk, whether their own, or even a random man’s. Like I said, projecting their own insecurities.

If it bothers YOU that much, sure surgery is a viable option. But if you yourself never seemed to see any issue with it prior to your ex/any other recent experiences since then, I think you should reevaluate your reasoning. There are a lot of immature guys out there. Just as this is true, there are a LOT of guys who aren’t, & who would actually love the way you look down there. Don’t let a couple immature guys ruin your perception of yourself. Keep your head up! I have no doubt you’ll find a guy who loves you just as you are sooner than you know."

AmItheAsshole,ffx10mk,t3_evimar,1580315437.0,"I hate that you even felt you needed another opinion on this. You’re certainly NTA. Your father neglected his parental role your entire life seemingly so, & any requests for help were clearly dismissed. You mentioned how he mentioned his preoccupation with his new family, that shows he has the ability to take care of/support his family, he’s just picking & choosing who to support. He decided to ignore one of his children’s constant requests for help, and now, what? He honestly thought you would help HIS daughter from another marriage? 

If your father had been the type of person who was always there for you when needed, hell or even just whenever he was able to actually help, then it would maybe make sense to at least consider helping, though personally that still sounds like something he as the father needs to take responsibility for, not you. But he very clearly had no desire to help you when you needed it, you should feel absolutely NO desire to help him, or any guilt for not doing so. Your parents are supposed to be your caretakers. It’s only the other way around after many years of them doing what parents are supposed to do. You owe that man absolutely nothing."

BPD,ffw7deg,t3_evbfiv,1580287802.0,"I was briefly in an inpatient program, not specifically because of my BPD, but because I was actually looking for an outpatient program to help with my depression bc I didn’t think I could take the time off of work for an inpatient stay. The local psych center here turned out to be the only psychiatric choice with no wait (others had waiting lists months long) & I went in to see about their outpatient program. Somewhere along the line though, I was a bit too honest with the lady evaluating me, & she took a response of mine to her more seriously than I expected & I was committed for about 5 days.

I think at that time, I certainly did need it, & it turned out that I was able to call my job & just tell them I was dealing with a medical emergency & would be gone for a few days & they were super empathetic/understanding luckily. As for the impact it has had on my BPD, well, it was an interesting time period, & the medication that they put me on actually helped my depression a great deal. Everyone’s experiences are different though, only you know what’s best for you. If you feel as though you are struggling so bad with your mental health that you need to actually stay at the hospital, cool. It may be the little break that you needed, it was for me. But, outpatient programs are definitely more flexible & apparently recommended for those with BPD."
BPD,ffw6ri7,t1_ffvpqpn,1580286953.0,"With all due respect...you lashing out on that person for just giving you a genuine (and personally, I thought, helpful...) comment is a clear indicator of BPD & it’s often the main thing that pushes people away. Most of us here are dealing with BPD too, so we can relate in a sense at least. Listen, I do it too sometimes. A seemingly minor comment to someone else, comes off as a complete personal attack on me, when in reality, the opposite is true. 

For you to assume the person who responded to you has no empathy because they didn’t give you the exact answer you may have wanted is far fetched, in fact, it seemed like they were being as empathetic as possible. You’ll never get any closer to conquering/dealing with BPD by assuming everyone is out to get you. Again, I get it. I’m not at all exempt from this criticism, in fact the only reason I feel so comfortable saying all of this to you is because I get it. I battle those demons too, But you’ve got to me more receptive to advice and even constructive criticism if you’re going to work towards improving. 

You speak of their lack of empathy, but how’s your empathy doing? Its literally as simple as putting yourself in the other persons’ shoes, & trust I know how hard it is when you’re going through hell yourself, but realizing that if you lash out on every single person who says every little thing that might rub you the wrong way, it won’t be long before the abandonment that we fear so much, will become a reality, is key. More often than not, the fear of abandonment is irrational, & in overthinking & the assumption that the person automatically has your worst interest in mind, you ultimately cause that irrational fear to become reality. 

You may find my advice “rude” as well, especially if you found theirs rude. But, I assure you that nobody is here to hurt you. My intentions are only to help others going through what I’m going through, if it gets misconstrued, that’s life. I just hope that you at least consider what I’ve said instead of jumping to the conclusion that I too, am just being a dick or something."
BPD,ffw5ofa,t3_evgqgl,1580285495.0,"I was on lexapro for a few months before insurance issues forced me to quit going to my psychiatrist. Personally, I feel like it truly helped me. Now that I think back on it, when I was taking lexapro & klonopin, I had a LOT less problems with BPD symptoms, especially my fear of abandonment/attachment issues. It was the first time in a long while that I was actually able to focus on my own personal interests & enjoy alone time without needing/wanting to be around anyone else. It was during this time that my friends whom I usually had to bug to hang out with, actually became the ones who hit me up all the time to hang out. 

Everything works different for everybody though, keep this in mind. If by some chance lexapro doesn’t work for you, don’t give up by any means, you just need to find the right one for you."
BPD,ffw5cx5,t1_ffv1uvh,1580285075.0,"This. Whenever explaining to therapists or whoever else, I have a hard time articulating my parents’ impact on my wellbeing. My parents weren’t physically abusive, & for a long time I didn’t even want to consider going as far as to say they were emotionally abusive because I’ve met/witnessed much worse. But hands down the one thing I can verify with absolute certainty is that my feelings were constantly, if not always, devalued/overlooked, sometimes even laughed at. I can’t recall many situations at all in which my parents actually made an attempt to comfort my distress in any way. I just remember feeling...alone overall. I know my parents love(d) me, & they weren’t always terrible at expressing love, I just didn’t receive nearly as much as I needed I guess, & I’ve kind of lended them some slack over the years as I’ve come to know how my parents’ parents are. A lot of why they took such a cold/distant/less affectionate route in parenting is most likely because that’s how they themselves were raised. It just sucks that because of that seemingly minor issue, I’m terrible at decision making & regulating my emotions without drugs/alcohol."
BPD,ffw4r9y,t3_evi75t,1580284294.0,"Very good question. Personally, yes & no. I feel like as an individual, absolutely. My FP is my best friend, & we’ve been pretty close for some time now, but I’ve also been in love with her pretty much since we first met. That’s where the unhealthy part comes in. I don’t think SHE is unhealthy for me at all, we have a great friendship overall, but my attachment to her? Definitely unhealthy. Every. Little. Thing. She does or does not do, affects me more than anything. I’ve put her on a pedestal & in turn I’ve set myself up for sabotage. And similar to what you stated, for a longgggg time, If anything she did or said triggered me enough, it was enough to make me act out with often times random sex partners, or ones I just wasn’t actually interested in at all, just to take my mind off of my FP temporarily. 

I deal with splitting a LOT, so of course there are some days where I can think about something seemingly minor she may have done/said to me & it’ll make me temporarily totally flip my view of her on a pedestal, to her being “just like everyone else”. This of course, changes pretty quickly when I get with/talk to her again & things are normal.

If you truly feel as though your FP themself is not healthy for you, that should be all the more reason to move onward, however hard that may seem bc the last thing you need is toxicity on top of dealing with BPD. If it turns out you’re in a similar situation to myself, & any unhealthiness/toxicity primarily comes from within, that knowledge alone is the first step to getting better & doing what you can to try & avoid self sabotaging anymore than you might already."
BPD,ffw3k57,t3_evdwzs,1580282788.0,"Everyone has provided great advice here so far, I wish I had been given it myself. 

I totally understand/feel you on this, I think about it pretty often myself. Truth is, the only way I personally get around it is to feign that I’m not feeling what I actually am. I don’t condone this, however. It’s just the easiest way for me personally, to ensure that I’m not gaslit/mocked/ridiculed for feeling things. The notion that men have to be these stone cold primal beings with no emotion, to be a man is one of the many things that drives so many men to suicide. Emotions aren’t gender exclusive. You just have to remind yourself that you are human, & men absolutely experience emotions just as women do, I think the main difference is a lot of men are taught to shut up/hide it. Just another reason why I’m positive there are a LOT more men with BPD than we think, due to stigma, they just aren’t coming out & being heard/discovered."
BPD,ffw2zv4,t3_evgadt,1580282104.0,"I feel this. I’ve made similar (although admittedly vague) attempts at getting my FP in specific to learn more about BPD/explain that my reaction to certain things is often times a result of BPD, but more often than not, people just brush this off as another “excuse”.  Funny to me, considering I like to think of myself as someone who knows when to accept responsibility when necessary, & I would think it would be common sense to connect two & two together if I’m exhibiting behaviors of the personality disorder that I’m diagnosed with, but again most people who aren’t struggling with MH or maybe not the same issues, just see it as an excuse. “Yeah, but you can’t blame that entirely” gee whiz, I’m NOT trying to absolve myself of any responsibility or guilt by any means, I’m literally communicating to you WHY I did what I did in hopes of better understanding."
BPD,ffw28zu,t3_evh8zk,1580281223.0,"Definitely. What makes it worse is if the people around you know you have a personality disorder, so then they just attribute every single bad mood/emotion of yours to the personality disorder. It’s never another persons wrongdoing anymore, it’s never anything more than “mood swings” bc of the disorder, so essentially how you feel is overlooked entirely, & almost deemed dramatic by people."
BPD,ffw1s37,t3_evgybk,1580280689.0,"Absolutely. Problems with object permanence are common in those with BPD. It’s so stressful/hard to explain this phenomenon to friends who likely know nothing about it. I have a close friend of mine who I love very dearly, but not long ago she temporarily moved to a different country. During this time, she made countless attempts to converse with me through text, but I found it nearly impossible to keep up with because she was half way across the world as opposed to right around the corner as usual. How do you explain to someone that if they aren’t physically with you, they more or less temporarily don’t exist? (When in reality, they very clearly do.)

This friend has since moved back, & now I’m constantly the one trying to rekindle our friendship & not surprisingly at all, she has less commitment to do so now. 

I often get shit for this from a lot from friends, my FP included. Things will be great as long as I see you regularly. If not, it’ll just eventually get to the point where I almost forget you exist momentarily. Even worse, I’ll probably start “splitting”.  These same friends wonder why I am sometimes unable to keep up with their text messages whilst not seeing them. For me, text messages alone just aren’t the same, eventually I get bored. I’m starting to get a lot better with not needing to talk to my friends nearly as often as time goes on & I mentally grow/or otherwise have other things to fill up my time though."

Fast forward a little bit & I started smoking weed again. I’d see my therapist & she would ask about any drugs, I’d tell the truth & say I started smoking again.

Oral doesn’t detect far back at all, I’ve heard of SOME lucky people smoking the day before & passing those things (I wouldn’t try it though, I tried it once & failed an oral swab).

ask_transgender,ffvpwsl,t3_evbpqf,1580270009.0,"I first came out I’d say maybe about a year or two before I ended up getting around to actually starting hormones, & the first people I told were my current best friend, & another friend of mine at the time. Truth be told, I don’t think I even had much desire to do so, I only did it because I believe I tweeted/retweeted some things that made my friends ask, & they were people whom I trust(ed), so I just told them. 

They were pretty receptive for the most part, & as supportive as they could be. At one point the (former) friend of mine made a weird comment that made me question her, but all in all it wasn’t ever anything really too negative. (Not to mention, I reiterate this is now a former friend, my current best friend was always pretty supportive).

They didn’t treat me any differently at all. They even asked if I wanted to be referred to as he/him & at the time, I told them I didn’t until I actually started “appearing” male publicly. I never actually told my parents, I decided to let them find out on their own as my voice deepened & I grew facial hair & luckily overall I have a great, loving family because it hasn’t been a problem like I definitely assumed it would have been. I think this is partially because my family definitely saw it coming, & thus had been preparing for it for some time. 

Everyone’s story is different, only you know what’s best for you. Go with your gut. If it had been up to me, I would have never “come out” to much of anyone about it, really because I was so worried about what everyone would think, ironically enough, my fears were irrational in the sense that I had no real reason to fear after all. If you can gauge how people in your life might act, & decide that it would probably be positive, I would definitely say go for it. If however, you feel as though you may not get a great reaction (or worse, a violent one), it’s best to keep it to yourself for now & let time do it’s thing. Some people don’t care either way though, they’d just like to get it off their chest & that’s cool too. Good luck! & try & stay positive no matter what anyone may or may not say about it."
truscum,ffvco9d,t3_euhrx4,1580261000.0,"I’ve been on testosterone a little over a year now. As far as “socially” transitioning, that more or less just came with time for me as I didn’t necessarily want anyone to start referring to me as a guy before I actually appeared as one. I’d say about, 3 months in, my voice began to first drop a bit, and by this point, most people I didn’t know were referring to me as a male (I also didn’t own a binder until not long ago though), so often times the rare occasion that I would get “misgendered” would be when someone happened to glance down for a second & notice breasts, then say “Oh, I mean ma’am, sorry!”. 

I started testosterone when I was 22, so I did that process by myself. I also didn’t “come out” to my family, even after I started hormones. Because of this, I never had to come out, my family then knew of course once my voice dropped & I started growing some facial hair. Legally, I’m supposed to actually finally begin my name change process tomorrow, it’s long overdue for me I feel as I’ve always hated my birth name for reasons aside from it being gendered. 

As it currently stands, I absolutely pass 100% which is a huge blessing. I’m primarily stealth, but in the rare occasions that I do end up telling someone I am trans, each time they’ve been confused as hell & thought I was a guy wanting to transition to a girl but hadn’t taken any steps and/or tend to say something along the lines of “If I saw you on the street, I’d just think you were a man!” Which is somewhat of a compliment, I suppose? 

No surgeries as of yet, though I do plan to get top surgery when I am able to afford it.

Anyways, transitioning is a process we will never truly be finished with. I remember like it was yesterday, being at the start of my transition & being so anxious about my voice finally dropping & growing some facial hair, but time flies so fast, now I have both of those things & though I’m still not completely satisfied, that’s how it should be. That’s how we improve ourselves, that’s what life is about, whether you are trans or not. Patience is key, I know it’s easier said than done, but you’ll be in a comfortable spot before you know it, I’m sure."
truscum,ffvatba,t3_evdt8u,1580259750.0,"Definitely felt everything you said. Hell, that’s how I got here myself, almost felt like I was “pushed” here. Some months ago I was interacting with/mutually following quite a few other trans people & I felt I had a nice little community almost, on Twitter. Then one day, someone said you didn’t need GD to be trans. I thought it weird considering GD is the literal reason that I am in my current position as a trans man, so I composed a tweet that basically said you need GD to be trans & if you don’t have it, you aren’t. Plain & simple. It wasn’t long before I was bombarded with comments labeling me as transphobic, self hating, gatekeeper, etc & my previous community quickly unfollowed & blocked me. 

A cult. That’s exactly what it seems like. How on earth do you get so indoctrinated that you are willing to deny both biology & GD as being a legitimate issue that trans people have. & if you don’t have GD, how on earth could you say you are trans? It’s literally the one pre-requisite (or so I thought). Then I started to see people calling trans people who believed in biology “truscum” & did a bit of research on where all the terminology came from. I’m so glad to have went through all of that though, as I wouldn’t have ever found a TRUE community of actual rational thinkers who don’t put their feelings before logic & think inclusivity is the key to everything."

It bothers me specifically as a trans man to see so many of these people who clearly appear female due to any lack of transition (more importantly, the lack of desire to do so) but maybe just with a short haircut, who decide to put on makeup/a dress & call themselves trans men. (Feminine trans men can & do exist, but pre-T? Why would any legitimate trans person want to look closer to their sex at birth?!) I think everyone should express themselves how they please & live life as they please, but my issue is these people are literally becoming the main thing people see when it comes to “trans men”. So now I feel the overwhelming majority of trans men are painted as/thought of as, such. Little do they know, most people couldn’t even point out an actual transsexual man out of a group of “cis” males. But I don’t blame them for thinking otherwise, because THESE people are on the forefront, prancing around as “soft bois”. 

Then don’t get me started on the GNC/NB people who present as trans women, & the damage they do to the image of trans women.

I wish someone would tell these people that it’s okay to not conform to the gender binary, & still be your birth sex. Just because you’re a girl who has a couple of masculine hobbies and/or likes to dress masculine, doesn’t mean you’re necessarily trans, & vice versa. Also, how on EARTH can you be non binary & a binary gender?"
truscum,ffuwrpr,t3_ev6fey,1580250819.0,"When you put it into perspective this way, it certainly tugs at my heart strings as well, & I try to be empathetic towards everyone, detrans folks included. I will say though, I’ve had somewhat of a harsh view of them for a while, simply because nearly every detrans person I see/come into contact with online is not only detrans, but they think because it didn’t work out for them, NOBODY is truly trans & now suddenly they’re against transitioning/hormones period. Like, it’s totally cool to acknowledge you made a mistake & were wrong about something, but to be so deluded that you assume everyone is the same is borderline psychotic. 

Doesn’t make it any better that detrans people get LOADS of attention from already anti trans people, who are against transitioning. They use every little opportunity to try & use the number of recent detransitioners as reason against trans people. Totally neglecting the facts that most of these people transitioned at an early age & that has an affect on it a lot of times. 

It also bothers me when people try & put detransitioners & actual transsexuals into one box as if they are one in the same, when we’re complete opposites. As someone who truly feels as though transitioning saved my life, it’s insulting to see people look at a couple detrans people & assume that means that’s how it’ll be for everyone. If more detrans people were willing to share their experiences/stories without bias, it would be great, maybe it would help prevent more detransitions in the future."
meth,ffus1mn,t1_ffun6np,1580248275.0,"Like the other guy said, it does vary person to person but personally weed is a LIFE SAVER for me whilst coming down, especially as far as my heart rate. I’ve also smoked with a guy who said it didn’t help him comedown/just made him higher though, & we were smoking the same ice & bud. If you generally do well with weed, I’d surmise that it could definitely help."
antinatalism,ffuifzl,t3_euwxfy,1580242629.0,"The key I’ve personally discovered is to find not only the right job, but having the right coworkers/managers as well. I’m currently at my first job that has been not only tolerable, but one I can actually say I somewhat enjoy. It’s truly the first job that didn’t make me contemplate killing myself more than I already did. The only difference between this job & my previous ones seems to legitimately be the staff I work with. I’ve always worked around pretty decent people for the most part, but when you work around supervisors who always acknowledge your hard work & keep positive attitudes as well as a great sense of humor & empathy, it truly does almost feel like a family. 

I work in retail, as I have been for years. As it currently stands, I don’t plan to stay here forever, though the job does pay pretty well, even more so when it comes time to a promotion, so I’m not totally against that possibility either. Anyways, my point is, retail is retail. You know what I mean if you’ve ever worked retail, it pretty much sucks because people suck as a general rule of thumb, especially entitled ass customers. However, having a great team behind you truly does wonders at making the time fly & it almost doesn’t seem like work sometimes."
Drugs,ffrxl7g,t3_eu8pti,1580168184.0,"That’s crazy, I wouldn’t have expected PA to be tougher on first offenders than VA. I live in VA & the first time I got caught with weed, they just took my shit, gave me a court summons & I was put on the first offenders program for probation. It wasn’t until I decided to be a dumbass and smoke in my car with an inspired inspection sticker while on probation, that I was actually first arrested."
Drugs,ffrv0v4,t3_euu281,1580166460.0,"You likely have an addictive personality like myself. I get addicted to any and everything that feels good enough, drugs or not. Everyone has different reasons behind having an addictive personality, I’ve personally been using drugs as a crutch since I was about 15. Before I ever touched drugs, I was addicted to being on the computer/playing video games.

The only thing you can do, if this rings true to you as well, is acknowledge the problem & do what you can to avoid any situation in which you will become dependent on a drug. It’s easier said than done of course."
truscum,ffq4vas,t1_ffq4pph,1580120603.0,"Same, that’s the exact reason for my embarrassment bc that’s exactly how society views it. The media latches on to one story about trans people & uninformed people assume that every trans person has some form of connection in one way or another, to whichever one may be listed in the article. I hate seeing it because I know other people will look at it & just see that as all the more reason to see them as a trans men as female, therefore (although I too, am stealth), I feel like they assume all trans men are similar & it really screws with me."
