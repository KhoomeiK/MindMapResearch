That’s some real talk. Yes, I was raped 3x by 4 people in 5.5 months between late 2015-2016. Those feelings you listed have been bedside for years, I’m having a hard time shaking them. Partly due to the fact that it’s taken me years to realize two of them were what they were and with who. I do feel weirdly that I could practically sniff out a pedophile, but not an adult sexual predator. 


It’s like, once my eyes were open to the umbrella term Rape and all the little sub-situations (drugged, drunk, sober non violent, frozen, etc.), my brain is going through my childhood picking up long forgotten instances of Hey Guess What You Also Survived.


Thank you for pointing that out, now I see that this influx of intrusive memories and flashbacks are therapy worthy lol. Yippee, more work."

I love that word, thank you.


The thing is, I didn’t feel pressured. I knew it was weird that my friends my age were sleeping with older men, but they kept telling me I was in the wrong in that thinking. There’s two clear instances, the 30-somethings, that have became crystal clear in memory recently and I just realized a bit ago that when I was a teenager warning my friends about these “creepers” that it was my alarm bells going off on pedophiles and I’m even more blown away that when it inevitably came out that these guys were shady, they didn’t believe me and looking back WOW how did they not see that?!


I’m sickened, I still feel violated that I can clearly remember, in vivid detail, this one night camping with two friends and a group of strangers, one was a 30s male, rest of us were teens, I was 15. He was... falling out his shorts when he asked me to sleep in his tent to keep me warm. And when I told my two friends later in the brush, they hushed me and told me to keep it to myself, never to be brought up again.


I threatened to break a guy’s hand if he didn’t remove it from my thigh when I was 15. He was later accused of kidnapping his “wife” (who was 18 with a little baby she confirmed was his) at 14 years old and the three of them fled the area one night never to be seen or heard about again. Like, my creep-o-meter was off the charts with that one and no one believed me.


I’m both floored that I essentially spent my adolescence dodging these people, and that my friends at the time not only were all about it, but made me out to be a prude. Which is wrong, that’s not correct thinking. Some of them might be whirling like me. It’s just a lot of shock, horror, anger, disbelief, and bewilderment."
rapecounseling,f8rkcsh,t1_f8q01q1,1574742832.0,"I don’t think it’s foolish to not speak up. Sometimes we have to do what’s in the best interest for us, even if that’s not reporting, not outwardly accusing, even not thinking about it and pushing it far far away.

ptsd,f8ritvu,t1_f8rfofj,1574741572.0,"I love the idea of finding out why you were drawn to it in the first place! There’s so many artists and bands I’ve essentially blacklisted because they remind me of crappy people. I miss the music and the shows and the feeling of home there, not the specific people that ruined it.


Yes I’m in therapy and medicated. I see my doc tomorrow, in fact."
ptsd,f8rbxmo,t3_e1faoz,1574736712.0,"What I did might not work for you, and it may not have been the totally correct way to do it, but hell if it didn’t release some pressure. My big trigger for those violent, vigilante thoughts are motorcycles anywhere around me. Two of the males that raped me ride motorcycles with a best friend of one of them who introduced us and shamed me after the fact also being a motorcyclist. Sometimes when I’m on the road behind any motorcyclist, I just want to run them over and over and over even though I vaguely know it’s not any of those people. The rage is so frickin strong I sometimes start shaking and have to pull off the way to get away from them.


So I found alternative ways to get where I need to that I rarely see motorcycles. I’m rarely on the freeway anymore. I flat out will pull off the road if I’m being tailed by a motorcycle. I deep breathe like it’s a hard stop, a slamming of a pause button. Seriously, get into deep breathing, it’s great for both getting to sleep and calming down. Therapy has helped tremendously in that I can voice to someone that I have these violent thoughts because X happened and she’ll not call the cops on me but instead talk me through it. Unbiased talking is amazing. And the last thing I do is calling local hotlines and complaining to them. Where I’m at, they’re really only able to support whatever I say, not necessarily guide me, but sometimes hearing that my anger is valid is all I need."

ptsd,f0bd8w9,t3_d4bj39,1568525511.0,"Yeah, as soon as I saw your title, I just audibly said “fuck those people”. While I feel it wouldn’t be wise to show up to his office with an appointment in an act of defiance, I can only imagine the feeling of success you must have right now. Screw him, you’re rockin this and I’m super proud of you. Not only have you proved him wrong, but you’re still taking the step to reach out for help when you need to and that’s huge in itself. 

When I was 13-14 years old, I was well versed in how therapy doesn’t work if you’re forced into it, as I had been for 6-7 years at that point with additional years before it clicked. At that age, I had a counselor tell me that I was like a hollow rock in that I had a tough exterior (I was a budding punk rocker) but completely empty on the inside. She often would tell me that because I would take my studded bracelets off at the end of school it meant that it was all a show, even though my spiked collar and chain & padlock stayed on my neck unless I showered, though I lost the key to the padlock several times.

When she told me that, I smiled and asked if that was all she had to say. She said there was 40 minutes left in the appointment and I stood up and said there was for her, but I was done. Last I heard, she was teaching Zumba after her practice went under. Shocking, I know. She’s a classic example of why not to pick mental health professionals based on how fun their last names are lol."

ptsd,f06vl7a,t3_d3zob6,1568446748.0,"I have the same issue. Unfortunately my music taste has drastically changed because of my experiences. I used to be heavily into punk music. Now, funny enough, I only listen to it in defiance when I wish it didn’t cause so many issues. Social Distortion is a HUGE trigger, especially a later album. Floater and Jamie Johnson are off the table. Jamie Johnson’s Living In Color (or something like that) came on at the restaurant today and I immediately went into panic mode. That’s the last song I remember hearing before being raped the first time. I was really getting into EDM (electronic dance music) and couldn’t get enough of Deadmau5 until Fucker #3 so now any artist in that genre is a trigger. Jason Aldean is a moderate trigger, which sucks. Ballyhoo in general is a big no-no.

More than that, though, I used to go to concerts all the time. Now I can’t without dissociating most of the way through or running out in a panicked frenzy. I finally got to see Pink live last April which was a bucket list artist, and I about hyperventilated my way to the balcony outside during one of her songs."
ptsd,ezs4499,t3_d1vhis,1568082532.0,"Yeah, same. When a bad day rolls around (farther apart these days), I’m wiped out for a few days.

ptsd,ez9gd2b,t3_d0g6aq,1567781636.0,"Yep, I used to avoid sleeping at night because for some odd reason the nightmares were worse at night. When I was first having issues, I’d wake up drenched in sweat, there was a body print on my sheets in the dead of winter more than once. I’d jump up gasping for air like I stopped breathing, and immediately, even without those issues, I would be panicking. Those were with or without nightmares. I started staying awake for as long as possible, then drinking and smoking weed (cross faded) until I could just collapse and not have anything happen, which came with other issues (hello addiction, my old friend)."
rapecounseling,eyk70qv,t1_eyk3gmc,1567138979.0,"So after some light searching, I realized that I should define things better, although my calling it sexual assault isn’t exactly wrong, it’s that the term is kind of an umbrella for other acts including rape. I just prefer using that term because “rape” to me is an ugly word and I plainly don’t like it lol. To each their own, and that’s okay. What I was saying is sexual assault is legally defined as rape.

“The term rape is often used as a legal definition to specifically include sexual penetration without consent.”

“The term sexual assault refers to sexual contact or behavior that occurs without explicit consent of the victim. Some forms of sexual assault include:

Attempted rape, fondling or unwanted sexual touching, forcing a victim to perform sexual acts, such as oral sex or penetrating the perpetrator’s body, penetration of the victim’s body, also known as rape”

[Here is a good website with lots of info](https://www.rainn.org)"
rapecounseling,eyk34ht,t3_cx9x6z,1567135452.0,"Regarding the first one, if you’re saying no to sex while making out, the other person’s sole responsibility is to listen to you and stop. Going forward with making out would be totally up to you, and they should listen and respect your decision on that matter. The fact that he coerced you into sex is shameful on his part and while I’m not a licensed professional, I can tell you that the instance with the first person does constitute as sexual assault. Even if you changed your mind, the fact that he didn’t stop when you initially said no is the key there.

The second one I’m afraid to say is also sexual assault. When the tone of a sexual experience changes in regards to a different person trying to pull the covers off of you, the person that you were initially going to be intimate with is supposed to comfort you and not shame you by calling you names (from your description it doesn’t sound like it was in the lines of a kink, but correct me if I’m wrong) and acting like a total dick. I feel the better course of action for him to have taken would be to make sure you’re okay and, if you were okay with this, reschedule the intimate moment. Also, sometimes our brains block out traumatic spots that have happened to protect ourselves, so I think of that as our brains putting up a shield between the memory and our ability to replay it. Just a thought.

Coming from someone who was drunk for 2/3 of my sexual assaults, being intoxicated automatically takes away any consent that could be offered. That actually had to be drilled firmly into my head by a number of doctors lol. My heart hurts that you’ve experienced such crap by cowards. I hope you can find support and a good sexual assault/trauma focused therapist because it makes the difference, when you’re ready. And keep posting here as you see fit, there’s awesome people here."

My traumas have been blow after blow lately and my stomach is having a temper tantrum about it. I haven’t had symptoms since 2014 and now I’m toilet bound. It’s interesting to me how trauma, stress, can affect other parts of our bodies. Stomach aches, migraines, aches and pains not related to physical memories but just constant tension. For me it’s also kicked up my psychotic disorder, worsened my anxiety tenfold, and brought my depression to some serious lows.

If it’s possible, OP, get checked out by a gastroenterologist, they’re gut docs. They’ve got magic in their practices for some."

rapecounseling,eugt6nf,t3_cgf17o,1563814418.0,"I’m so terribly sorry for what your ex did to you, there were many things you said and did that he should’ve taken as a ‘stop’ and he shouldn’t have convinced you to try anal without lube after you said no, that’s absolutely not okay.

There is a line between BDSM and (non-)consent. That line is named **respect**. I, too, had to hear this about one of my assaults, also anal and with a lot of pain. Basically, if you use the safe word, are making abnormal noises to pain (think screaming out that it hurts isn’t a normal reaction for you) and they don’t stop, it crosses the line to non-consensual. Him saying you’re not allowed to use the safe word and not being in tune with your needs is massively f-cked up on his part. Unless you two agreed to it beforehand, safe words exist for this exact reason. To be in a BDSM relationship, it’s actually the submissive that has all the power, with the safe word(s), what they’re willing to do or not do, and the Dom *has* to abide by what the sub agrees to/doesn’t agree to because otherwise the Dom is in hot water. There’s actually a number of BDSM people that sign contracts that detail exactly what is/isn’t a go during their time together.

Sadly I am inclined to believe, based on what your wrote, that your ex sexually assaulted you. Your current bf has a right to be mad and all other feelings, he just shouldn’t act on them. If I may say, you deserve support and kindness during this time. If you’re able to, please look into talking with a therapist who specializes in sexual assault trauma, the positives of them far outweigh going through this alone. Then there’s RAINN which is a great 24/7/365 hotline in the US (I don’t know if you’re here) that offers support and an ear. Also, keep posting here, we’re here for you too.
