I relate to this situation as I‚Äôve been unable to hold down a job for seven years, my exes‚Äô families have sometimes really sucked, and I also sometimes self harm again and then get really mad at myself. Then this is the bossy reply I sometimes need to hear:

Try to give yourself a little grace. This is a very stressful situation and you‚Äôre doing your best. Your boyfriend‚Äôs family is his issue to deal with, so focus on getting yourself sorted out/being safe and let him deal with them. You can control your behavior and you can‚Äôt control other people‚Äôs thinking, so accept that and do what you need to do to start feeling better. 

Maybe try starting here: Let out a long sigh, take a deep breath, pour yourself a glass of water, drink it, and then pet your cat."

I could create a memoir! Ha."

Edit: What I mean by ‚Äúbe as vulnerable as‚Äù is that they don‚Äôt work on their own shit and because you‚Äôre openly working on yours, they try to make you think that their problem is you projecting onto them."

BPD,fh4iv6k,t3_f1cbcd,1581279111.0,"I feel like I really understand where you're at. Apologies in advance for the long and mostly introspective comment. I'm leaving it because I think that it might help you get some perspective on where you're at.

My ""savior/savee"", a survivor of child abuse who has diagnosed, though untreated, Bipolar 2 plus some substance abuse issues, has sent me back to my parents'. He used to be an amazing boyfriend and he's tried to remain that way (I know he's really tried), but now he's given up on me. He said that I've wasted his time and that the end of our relationship is all my fault (even though I am: the only one going to therapy, working to improve my behavior and communicate better (to the tune of $1600/week), and -oh yeah- am currently adjusting my out-of-whack psych meds, a process which has caused me a ton of suffering and has been too difficult for him to bear through one of his hypomanic episodes). 

I have just realized that he's blamed me for absolutely everything that has gone wrong in our relationship since the beginning, and that I've allowed him to do it because I feel more defective than he does. He's used my BPD diagnosis to blame me for all of his paranoia and PTSD and, finally, he's decided that I'm just the worst person ever. It hurts SOOOOO much to be pushed away like this, but now I'm in a safe place where I don't have to worry about pleasing someone who isn't taking good care of himself."

BipolarSOs,ffh12n2,t1_ffgwhbi,1579920270.0,"I agree with you about bp2 being as much of a challenge as bp1, but I disagree about disclosing a diagnosis before dating. I believe people who are dating have a right to privacy about medical issues (save for birth control methods and sexually communicable diseases and infections) and that they also have a right to withhold such information until they are confident that they‚Äôve found someone they want to be with and not just date. My SO has done nothing outside my parameters. He told me about his diagnosis when I told him mine about a month into dating."
BipolarSOs,ffh03gq,t1_ffgc0ys,1579919526.0,"RE meds: I think he tried them briefly once. He‚Äôs 40 and has been self medicating with either alcohol or exercise and a healthy diet for his whole adult life. He‚Äôs an incredibly pleasant drunk, so his symptoms weren‚Äôt very apparent until he stopped drinking three weeks ago. I suspect he‚Äôs been ramping up to this episode since he stopped drinking. After he evens out, I think it‚Äôll be time to seriously discuss treatment options. I certainly won‚Äôt encourage him to drink again. 

RE sex: We usually have a very active sex life and now his sex drive is nearly nonexistent. I know that a super charged sex drive is common during mania, so I‚Äôm a little surprised about that, but I honestly don‚Äôt mind right now because his behavior is so unattractive. 

RE sleep: I hope he‚Äôll get honest about that soon. Yesterday he told me he‚Äôs been sleeping seven hours a night for the past two weeks, but his texts prove the contrary when I‚Äôm not with him and I know he doesn‚Äôt sleep when I am."

askwomenadvice,ew9ny4v,t1_ew7k4qn,1565228329.0,"Oh man, this is one of my favorite topics. Allow me to divulge. 

I‚Äôm going to share my hair care secret for pretty-haired poor people with you because I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve got hair just like yours. But first, the most important thing I‚Äôve learned in the past couple years has been to dry it differently and to stop touching it. These days i plop my wet hair down on an old silk handkerchief and sort of tie it up on top of my head while it‚Äôs wet. Then the curls can form and dry (mostly) without me tugging on them with my hands, which seems to make my hair angry/frizzy. The less I touch my hair overall, the better it looks. Back to the plopping - when I can no longer stand the thing on my head, I let my hair down to air dry the rest of the way while I continue to try not to touch it.  

Here‚Äôs the cheap/awesome part of my hair story: I‚Äôve been DYIing my shampoo and conditioner for a couple months and my hair just keeps getting better. For shampoo I dissolve one tablespoon of baking soda into one cup of water and apply it directly to my scalp with a squeeze bottle and rub it in really thoroughly (it doesn‚Äôt foam up but it‚Äôs definitely working). I don‚Äôt rub it through the rest of my hair, I just  focus on my scalp where the oil builds up and then let it flow wherever it goes beyond my roots. You‚Äôll know your hair is clean when the roots squeak after you rinse. For conditioner, and to make sure I‚Äôve rinsed out all of the baking soda, I apply a mixture of a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and a cup of water that I put into an old DevaCurl bottle LOL (plus some tea tree oil which smells good and is great for the scalp). Then I rinse out the ACV mix, wring my hair out by hand before I step out of the shower (skipping the cotton towel because it makes coarse hair coarser and I‚Äôm doing my best not to touch it any more), and I plop it on some silk like I described earlier to dry. Recently I‚Äôve just let it hang dry in the summer (no brushing ever, just a loose part made with a rat tail comb). Also, though I‚Äôve used a little mousse for hold in the past, I‚Äôve just stopped putting any product in it at all and my hair just bounces like I can barely believe. An added bonus for skipping the product is that my hair no longer gets all sticky in the heat and humidity and the wash lasts longer. 

So now my hair is softer and curlier, and the best part is I can go longer between washes than before. I only wash my  medium long hair once a week now, and that is something I never thought I could do. 

Oh, I should probably add that I‚Äôve done hair modeling many times and I‚Äôve received very expensive hair products for free in the past, yet my hair has never felt better than it does now AND IT COSTS ME PENNIES!!! PENNIES!"
