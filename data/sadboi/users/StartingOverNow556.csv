BPD,et6yhif,t1_et6e62f,1562521484.0,"It took me so long to see the evil around me.  I innocently thought that people were inherantly good.  My family lacked a theory of mind.  they thought everyone was just like them.  But I did too.  I channeled my 4 year old self.   My curious loving child.  Neglected and hurt... but my family did it for decades longer.  

Fuckmthose mother fuckers.  Be 4 years old.  love the clouds and flowers and ask questions and want to play.  I was ""bad"" for being happy and excited and curious and interested.  at 4, 6, 8, 10 years old.  I broke around puberty to decades of misery.  Finally fell to narcs trying to break a child of being a wonderous child.  

Fuck anyone that doesn't see your beauty and person.  It wasn't exactly what I did.. I was a mess. But in hindsight that is my advice.  Act like a child. A happy one, not a needy one.  

The kid that wanted his dad to play basketball or catch with him that never did.  Ecept I would count the number of times I threw a baseball high in the air and caught it.  Noone cared if I did it 45 straight times.  I did.  I somehow fullfilled myself as my parents rejected me.. as a small child.  I was hurt and sad at my parent's not caring about me at all... but somehow I was proud of myself.  They beat that out of me by 10 or 12 years old.. gradually. But at one point... I was a neglected kid that entertained himself and was proud of himself.  

Maybe you were once.  Or focus on that kid who can't even get his parents to wash or teach him anything or be impressed he could make a basket... I was impressed with myself once.  It took 30+ years of them destroying me.. to rechannel that  fucking kid.  The culmination to full freedom partly happened watching the oscar winning Into the Spider-verse.  I was old fat Peter Parker... but I was Peter fucking Parker at 6.. trying to get my parents to be parents.  I channelled all the moments I was not broken.  Like reverse PTSD maybe.  All the worst moments that give me PTSD.  I reveresed a lot to my best most empowered moments.  When I called them out or did something for myself. Asked a girl out for the first time with a corny poems. Bad and only one date.  Grade 11 I think.  But I was brave enough to ask a cute girl on a date... and in a weird cool way. 

Fuck the haters and doubters and abusers and bullies.  I am still alive and I had some bad ass moments... and sometimes I met my own needs.  Sometimes out of being pissed no one would ever meet mine. 

I didn't think like that... when I started fixing so many problems in my life gradually and empowerd myself... but looking back... I did that.. one moment at a time a few hundred times.  stopped hating myself and strted thinking... you raised yourself... of course you weren't that great at it.. but you did it yourself.. no one was helping you.  

I embraced deeper and deeper how truly evil and huge the abuse was.  I thought myself useless when I didn't really realize I was abused.  Now I realize I was not allowed to have any thought or feeling EVER.  EVER within my family.... that is unbelievably absurdly awful abuse... as bad as it gets really.  I am no victim though.  I survived... I am so badass I didn't consider horrendous abuse for decades.  

Or embrace empathy.  If what happened to you had happened to a friend... would you be angry?  in a rage?  sad? hurt?  Would you think... well you deserved it bitch?  That is how you are thinking about yourself. It doesn't make sense. 

I have done some crappy things... I know all the shitty things I have ever done.  At 43... I feel like a good person with my naughty list over a lifetime. at 15, 20,31 years old.. I felt the worst person ever... but what I had done ... wasn't really that bad at all... and I was a broken confused person that didn't really want to hurt anyone.  I felt shame and guilt over some pretty small and petty things... because I have a conscience and care about... things.  I realized my abusers had no empathy... and I have too much.  

I am not saying do any of this... and not all today.  But I guessing your pro and con list bout yourself is not how I would see you. Or the average person would.  you can't be perfect.  Excusing or forgiving old behaviours.. is different than making an excuse for new poor behaviours.  expecting a better self now to have been the person acting when you were younger and more of a mess...isn't really fair."
BPD,et6txdc,t1_et6k8ep,1562519257.0,"I know I can't change how much you hate yourself.  I hated myself for 31 years.  Suicide ideation so often, one attempt.  Not always, but so often.  Sometimes for 100 times a miute for weeks.. rocking.. wanting to die.  

It has been 12 years since I felt like that.  It so painful to me to know you are in so much pain.  I felt it.  Truly.  No bullshit.  But I know it can be different.  I had a lot of shit the last 12 years.  I was not happy or fulfilled the last dozen years, and I got abused by the same people even.  

Now no one is abusing me.  Finally free.  I don't want you to think of decades.. I was a slow learner.  You can be free of hating yourself though.  You truly can.  I want it so bad for you, I don't know how to figure out how you can do it... I just want you to know it is possible.  It is like my suffering of recent years... which was awful... pales so much in comparision to the self hatred I had for decades.  

I love you.  I care.  You are worthy.  I have been there, it felt endless and it fucking was... it feels like another life now.  I want you to believe it is possible to not hate yourself.  Imagine if life just kinda sucked.... but you didn't think you weren't worthy to breathe?  It is so much better that bleh or even more abuse feels not nearly as bad.  It is possible.  Really."

Believe me... the assholes that abused or continue to try to abuse us, they hate themselves way more than you hate yourself.  And they should.  You shouldn't.  They are all projecting their misery onto you.  Because you actually have empathy for others.  They don't.  Worthless vs priceless.  You are precious and priceless."
LifeAfterNarcissism,et6i46p,t1_et56fjz,1562513174.0,"You were tired.  Tired of being endlessly abused daily by the one person in the world whose greatest duty is to protect you from abuse.  

I feel like less of a sucker for taking 43 years to go no contact.  It is weird.  I could not even concieve of the evil of most of our parents.  It just didn't compute that any parent would act like that.  Since they were good enough not to beat or rape me... just brainwash and manipulate and hate me daily.  

I kept being told I was ""bad"", when I wasn't.  I was so ""not bad"" I couldn't understand true evil.  Most people aren't evil.  But somehow a lot of them are."
BPD,et4igwr,t3_c9u9dt,1562450828.0,"I just moved 1000 miles away from my home city of decades.  Living in a camp ground until  Monday when I move into a my new place, to escape my shitty family.

Great plan! Do it."
BPD,esyzb05,t1_esytaci,1562352346.0,"You are awesome.  You boosted me up and interacted with me.  I am healed and also so fucking broken.  I needed your affirmation, but not really that much, because I am healed for the most part.  But it means everything.  It is priceless.  
Priceless vs worthless is a weird thing.  Not the same as flammable and inflammable.  The latter mean the exact same thing.  The first priceless vs worthless mean the exact opposite.  

But it is a telling set of words to describe what narc upbringing versus normal is like.  

Every person is priceless.  Unique.  Narcs devalue everything to worthless except themselves.  But it is all bullshit.  Every tree and flower and well manintained loved home is beautiful and priceless. Every smile.  Every child acting like a child.  Getting called ""bad"" for being a child.  For being sad or happy or angry or hungry or any fucking thing.  Is absurd.  It is all priceless to any normal human.  

Even those words... are me on a deeper level.  Everything is priceless.  Every person I meet.  I think and do have an attachment disorder.  I love everything until it acts to hurt me.  I have dealt with a lot of it... but at the core.... I consider everything priceless.  You this comment, your comment, the house I bought, Every tree I walk by, everyone that stops to pet my dog and talks with me.  I hate no one but abusers and manipulators.  I do hate them.  
They... hate everything and consider everything worthless.  Themselves too.  But in society I am more odd or weird than them.  I can't hide it and I don't care who knows.  I don't carry shame in finding everything beautiful.  They do.  Feel shame in finding everything worthless.  

So they fit in better with neuro-typicals.  But they like us more, The neuro-typicals, but we are truly ""a lot"" and often so unfocused and random and confused about ourselves, we seem off.  But we are the best of humanity.  Or I am.  I will figure out how to get accepted better.  Or love the few that do. Like you did to me.  

You are priceless.  Not perfect.  It can be odd to take compliments on things people don't understand.  Like I lost a lot of weight getting off meds and being abused.  It sure does not feel ""nice"" to get complimented on a diet, when you had no diet.... you just got healthy and stopped being abused.  I can't take the compliment rightly and tell them my life story of my abuse and recovery and neuro's or most people, aren't prepared for intense intimacy, and it alienates their boundaries.  I have great self esteem and love myself (finally), and find it so hard to take compliments, yet find almost everything and everyone beautiful and priceless.  And recovery is not sharing that to everyone, all the time.  And I spent so many decades not realizing everything is priceless and I felt it and knew it on some level... but bought into my dad's hate of everything.  I was super optimistic about everything except myself.  I was the only worthless thing.  Not anymore.  I am beautiful and kind and giving and I realize how that confuses and overwhelms so many people.  I am fully self aware and mostly recovered but I have not yet implememtented this recovery knowledge into my life with others.  I will do it over months.  In a new city.  With all new people.  

Sharing all your bullshit like I am.  Is how I, and maybe a lot of people, can recover.  Not feel worthless.  I will remember this interaction forever. Today I fully owned and realized I was borderline.  And it literally does not matter as a label.  I am mostly recovered from the PTSD and borderline that abuse put into me.  Because of that.  I know that I feel everything is priceless.  I always intuitively knew it, but ignored it or could not accept it.  Now I can.  I attach to everything good.  But most things and people are.  And now I see assholes and can avoid them.  

I am an oddball weirdo that needs to figure out how to fit in better.  But I will.  I can embrace all of me and have a great life.  

The worthless abusers that hate everyone and themselves can sit in their own worthlessness.  I embrace beauty and pricelessness.  And my odd nearly recovered person and all the weirdness and extroversion and honesty that is part of it.  Again.. fuck worthlessness.  Told that for decades when I was always worthy, even at my absolute worst."
BPD,esysnmp,t1_esyorw9,1562348751.0,"My upbringing had no rape or beatings.  So I could not understand the dynamic and situation for 4 decades.... I should have seen it when I became and adult.  My brother drew me back close to the family whennI was 30 years old and started an internet business.  My worst abuse was as an adult.  It was emotional, but so controlling and dominating... I didn't truly find myself until the last year and No Contact.  

I am labelling it as complete abuse.  Because I mislabebled it forever.  I couldn't have a single thought or feeling of my own.  And was absolutely neglected except for shelter and stuff.  Of human touch, of getting taught to brush my teeth or comb my hair or wash myself or using deodorant.  

I thought of it so differently.  Good enough parenting.  But it was horrible.  Like insanity.  Every moment.  And us kids were blamed for everything and my brother went full NPD and got bamed everything blamed on me.  But it seemed somehow normal.  And dissismilar to most of my friends households from age 5-18.  There is a lot of NPD.  

It is weird.  I am defending myself and saying my background was not that ""rough"" because it seems you might be minimizing yours.  Or I am minimizing mine.  Or just trying to clarify.  I don't understand my intention.  I think you understand.  

If it was physical... I would have recognized it.  My dad emotionally punched everyone in the face he interacted with 24/7 50% of the time.  But not physically.  But I feel that kind of abuse can be worse.  It hides the pure evil in the person.  Makes you feel sorry for them.  Not think of them as so purely toxic and abusive. Like he already beat everyone into submission so he didn't have to beat anyone."
BPD,esyned5,t1_esydu5c,1562346048.0,"I was not thinking this when I wrote this.  It just came to mind.  Do you think I could be a life coach?  I was thinking of it.  I don't want to make big money from it or get anyone dependent on me.  I think I might more need to do it to have deep and intimacy and connection to others.  That is not a friendship.  It doesn't need to last.  If I was a life coach I would only want to really see anyone a few times.  That would be the point.  Free the person from needing a therapist or life coach in the same way.  

It is like... If don't have some outlet for my need to be around people in an intimate and real way.  Connect to feelings and honesty and authenticity and caring in me and someone else.  I will make a mess of new friendships or relationships.  

I think... I would be better at it than almost anyone.  I would just listen to people.  Share the times in my life that were similiar, and how I got through and others did.  I have been to so much therapy and 12 step groups.  Know hundreds of people with every mental illness that exists. I ""know"" them.  What makes them tick and what hurt them so badly.  

I feel like... I don't need to go to school or do anything but make a website and get a phone number.  And a tax dollar and charge $50 an hour.  And one client or 10.  I don't even need the money.  I need to do it to help people and be healthier myself.  The money also makes it professional.   I can't make friends with these people.  Ever.  It is all about a few hours to figure out them and point them in the right way.  Build them up, show them where they are sabotaging themselves.  Not about meds, or curing any disorder.  Showing them who they actual are right now.  Because I always see it in everyone.  And where they could be if they changed a in a few simple ways.  It might not always work.  But I feel it is what I am meant to be doing right now.  For all kinds of reasons. 

I didn't realize much of this... until I was writing it.  So I ask your opinion truly.  Am I full of shit?  Could I really hurt people by doing this?  Or only help them?  I am wondering why not just do that?  Do I sound like this seems a rational and good idea?  Or am I deluding myself somehow?  I don't need validation as much as I have few people in my life.  I would like at least a second opinion from anyone on a big move in my life that affects other people and not just me."
BPD,esyii1s,t3_c9gr6d,1562343977.0,"I can relate to everything you said.

&#x200B;

I don't truly know how to solve the problem.  But I moved to a new city and have 2 contacts from my city of 43 years.  An ex who is my best friend and a guy I met that literally let me move into his place after I sold my house and called me brother.

&#x200B;

I am so open... I attract everyone.  I have a dog, people come up to me.  Yesterday I was not in a good mood, went out for groceries and honestly beer to calm myself down.  I move into a new house on Monday and I am dirty and grimy from camping for weeks.  But I look ok.  Everyone talks to me.  I am in a terrible mood, just getting over that yesterday at like noon.  walking my dog in a part of the town.  I talk to a woman for 15 minutes.  She told me everywhere she lived, where the hidden beach is on the river, all about her dog.  Her life story.  I wanted to know where the beach was.  I went and drove a few hundred feet and found it walking my dog.  Met more people.

&#x200B;

I have to fight not being attached to things.  A family owns the campground I am at.  I like them.  I half convinced myself to try to get a job here... when I don't need a job, and want months to sort myself out and write a book.  If I like people or things, I want to be around them.  I realized, I am not broken, I am a magnet for people.  But I fuck it up by being attached so deply to everyone.  Because my parents never loved me.  I seek any attachments.  But after 4 decades... I am not such a mess.  Abusive Narciccists will attach to me... but everyone does.  Nice people.  I am my own problem.  In the sense that everyone senses I am open and likes me and starts conversations and so on.  I can't ""stop"" the natural connection properly.  Well now I can more.  But the powerful feeling are there.  I fall in love with everything I like or enjoy.  So many people I meet.  And that is amazing.  But once it is time to be close friends or girlfriends or a job.  I am too intense and intimate, right away.  I have learned better how to deal with that.  But it is still there.

&#x200B;

I feel like I am responding to what you are saying.  I am trying always to figure myself out.  I had no idea what I would write.  I feel attached to you by reading your post.  I care.  I need to figure out all my boundaries.  And not violate others.  Let friendships grow more slowly.  Date but not sleep with people for awhile, because then I am all in. And it always ends in weeks or a month.  Because I am ""too much"".  But I am not.  I am truly awesome and kind and nice and giving.  But the attachment thing never goes away.  I need to control how happy I get around people.  And I think I can and will and maybe have figured it out.

&#x200B;

I end friendships because I sense I am too intense, and start swamping others.  More often than others end them.  My family was abusive beyond measure and I was around so many toxic people that surrounded them.  They didn't respect my boundaries, they were all mostly shitty monsters.  The people in my life separate from people surrounding my brother... were nice and kind and good people.  I attract great people.  I just need to calm down and let the relationships play out.  Now I am not really needy or lonely.  But no matter what... I attach immediately to what I like.  If I meet a nice person.  I am best friends with them. In my mind and heart anyway. Because I truly like and enjoy them.  They aren't like me.... so they won't feel it for months like I do in a day. If I can figure out how to let others slowly acclimatize to me, and not act ""all in"" right away.  I hope I will have many deep friendships and fall in love and have a family.  But now I am ok on my own.  Not the best I could be alone, I get so, so much from deep friendships and relationships.  But I don't ""need"" them.  it could take months or longer.

At least I hope, starting over in a new city."
BPD,esybv3r,t3_c99vc3,1562341570.0,"I am 43, realizing I was ""borderline"" my whole life, and pretty much recovered in stages from most of the issues that come from it.  Mostly anyway.

I am able to be alone and literally don't care what anyone thinks of me.  I don't want to be anyone else.  At all.  I never really did, I wanted to be myself and never was.

&#x200B;

I say this only because today is really the first day I understood I was Borderline.  And I can relate so much to what you are saying.  Because I am so sensitive and empathic with others.  I stayed at a very outwardly gay friends house nfor a few weeks.  I really liked him and admired how he acted and treted everyone in his life.  And how he wore awesome bright pink, purple, rainbow clothes.  And was overweight and like didn't care about wearing tight shirts or fucking everything.  He was asking for attention, and showing who he was, and he didn't care much about what anyone thought, at the same time.  He was in his 40's.  He just did what he wanted to.

&#x200B;

I find myself buying bright clothes that are similar.  Save the rainbow ones.  But I always liked bright colors and wore clothes similarly in the summer often.  But I was doing it moreso.  I was so connected to him.  As a straight guy.  If I am around people I like with tattoos, I question myself and think of getting some.  And I might do that now too.

&#x200B;

I don't know.  Like with little recovery and being much younger, I felt it too.  in different ways.  I would be wearing a Bulls outfit being a full ""Wigger"" in style in like 1990, and then be wearing a leather jacket and ripped jeans and smoking pot.  I would not know who I was and attach to an entire style or mindset.  Of the people around me.  Not to impress them, because I had no sense of myself really.

&#x200B;

Now I know what I like.  I can pick up stuff from other people, styles, ways they act.  But I only take the stuff I actually truly ""like"" myself.

&#x200B;

The question is... do you really like piercings?  Do you know?  What do you really like?  And why do you like it.  Because you admire someone like that?  Want to become them?  It is freaking aweosme to change your style and appearance often if how you ""feel"" isn't right.  But realize what you do like about a certain style or appearance or ""attachment"".  Then keep that part of it, as you keep trying to figure yourself out.  Keep changing and ""own"" whatever you find is ""right"" for you.

&#x200B;

I realized we are all lost, and as you find something that is ""you"", keep it.  If it is dyed hair or piercings or journalling or walking in nature.  Classical music or death metal.  Own what you like, when you like it.  And keep everything that is ""yours"".  Life is long.  it is going to get better.  You will figure out more and more of what is ""you"".

&#x200B;

Edit: I hated myself for 32 years.  And have loved myself for 11.  And been a mess for most of those 11 years.  But often truly happy.  Up and down.  But not the misery I know you are feeling now.  I want to give you hope.  Things can be far better.  and you don't need to take decades to learn it like I did.  I like you.  I care about you.  I was you, I am you.  Find out how to be yourself.  It will take time to understand what you like.  But you are awesome already.  You reached out and were honest about where you are currently at.  That is the best possible place to be.  You are not only willing to change... you are craving it so bad, you are obssessed with it.  I am saying go with that... but pay attention and really realize when you LOVE something.  Then keep it.  That's yours and no one elses."
psychology,esy88uj,t1_esxzka9,1562340277.0,"I thought more about it.  I was always in a panic of some sort.  Now I deeply trust myself and don't doubt myself.  I am usually doing the right and healthy thing for myself.  With no specific plan, only general ones.  

I have no idea what I am doing or why... when I am doing it.  I sold my house and drove East.  Not knowing exactly where I would stop.  If I would buy a house or rent for the summer.  How big a city or town to live in.  I knew I didn't want to be house poor or in a big city.  I thought the ocean.  I stopped in a city of 17000 people on a river.  Literally on my way through.  The motels were booked so I stopped at a campground.  Literally the next day I looked at listings in the city, never had in researching a dozen plus places and hundreds of houses for 6 months.  Never thought this city.  But it was perfect.  I bought a house before I saw half, closed in 25 hours.  The 10 days of waiting to move in... exploring the area.  The house is 15 minute walk from 3 massive parks on the river.  The people are laid back.  Everything is right.  

I realized I am an ENFP too.  This past year. I thought I was some weird crazy unique person or oddly and uniquely gifted and cursed or something.  Nope. A lot of people are similar to me.  

I realized how I think.  I need information.  I heard the term grazing used.  I just need to consume a bunch of information and understand things generally.  Make broad decisions on what to focus on.  When the time comes to make a decision, I will, and it will be decisive.  It won't be out of my ass.  Or irrational.  But it can come out of no where.  Before I needed to understand everything before I made decisions.  Tried to force myself into making pro and con lists, did detailed research instead of consuming broad, broad strokes of information on something.  

Now I understand how I work.  I can be so much more effective.  I was making myself sick trying to force myself to act rationally, and logically... when really I always had anyway.  But I didn't trust myself and thought I was half crazy.  What my familes message always was.  Now I know I have my own back.  A lot of times when things got really bad.  I saved myself from myself.  It made no sense.  But all the sense.  I am still a bit of a mess.  New house on Monday.  But I trust myself.  I act rationally all the time.  People are just different in how they make decisions or process the world, and I was trying to  force myself to firstly ignore emotion, when it is everything to me.  Things need to ""feel"" right. When they do... then I act.  
I kind of thought Myers-Briggs was stupid.  Figuring out my personality type and separating it from the abuse was a big step I made in the spring.  I actually am ""normal"" 3 or 4% of people are similar to me.  I am not some uniquely broken confused person.  I am fine.  Big step."
BPD,esxzg3r,t3_c98m2o,1562337142.0,"It is funny.  You are doing on social media... EXACTLY what Reddit and Instagram or Facebook want you to do.  

They are programming everyone to feel and act like someone who is lonely and has borderline.  All the neurotypicals are supposed to act like you, when you are in misery and agony, desperate for human connection.  It equals max profits.  People buy stuff when they feel empty.  

I am so sorry you are feeling like this.  I felt that emptiness in so many ways, so many times.  So many.  I am old so it goes back to writing all my friends numbers on the back of a business card, before cell phones, or really the internet.  Take out my wallet and see who to call.  If no one was home... I was empty.  

Somehow at 43 years old I found true contentment in being alone.  And I found I didn't care about anyone's opinion of me a decade earlier.  

I can relate so much.  It angers me that society and social media make it worse, and try to make everyone feel as bad as you do.  The smartest people in the world are spending hours trying to make algorythyms, to make people feel as miserable as you do.  

I am sad for you and in rage at the world at this point.  Everything seems set up to hurt everyone else.  

&#x200B;

I write, and it took me a long time to be able to just write for myself.  In a journal, no one else will ever see.  I needed the outside validation.  Maybe try to have a journal, or a personal photo album if you like taking pictures more. That is just for you.  No one else.  Your thoughts or fears, or the most beautiful picture you ever took.  But don't share it.  You know it is beautiful, you don't need anyone else to validate or see it or care.  It is your picture or poem or thought alone.  

I did this.. somehow in the last year, and my life really changed.  If not my suggestion exactly, try to do something just for you.  That you never want to share.  Even it makes you want to share it more!  (it probably will).  I can share the idea that helped set me free and nothing of exactly the things that became just for me."
BPD,esxwmcm,t1_esusbqf,1562336149.0,"It is weird.  This thread made me realize that I am borderline.  As a 43 man.  Mostly recovered.  I thought the emotional deregulation was bipolar 2 for years.  It was all family of origin, abuse by my family.  Complex PTSD.

I so deeply wanted a family, I stayed in my horrible one decades too long, didn't have boundaries with others.  I never lashed out at others much either.

I am cured of most of the problem and symptoms, before I realize it best describes my secondary issue after PTSD my whole life.  In my mind, not having what I thought were key aspects of borderline, made me never think of it.

&#x200B;

This address and blocking finally fully sold me on my self re-diagnosis.  I can be hurt so bad.  I won't date for years at a time.  Because I will choose someone pretty cool and will fall in love in a day.  I know it will happen. Then have 4 weeks of intensity and it will be obvious the whole thing is too much.  For either of us.  I will make her fall for me too, and after a month she would realize I was ""off"" in some way.  

&#x200B;

I would do this 5 times in 12 years.  I managed a year with my probably true love.  twice.  I am not dating to mess with people, I would literally go years celibate, while handsome and able to attract a partner, I choose not to do it, despite extreme loneliness, because I know it will happen this way, and both of us are hurt.  I feel hypomanic.  

&#x200B;

It is like I was in my 30's or 40's but emotionally I am like 13 and falling in love for the first time.  With this new city, new friends, a new job, especially a girlfriend.  All the time, for years.  I attach deeply and fall in love deeply immediately to people or groups or places or jobs and when I fall out of love, or get abused. I am out. right away.  IDGAF.  

&#x200B;

I would choose being alone and isolated rather than have anyone hurt me, and for well over a decade... hurting anyone else.  I can't hurt anyone. On purpose anyway, besides defending myself.  Words that are true are the only thing I can do that.  

&#x200B;

I think I am Borderline and nearly healed enough to not be screwed up by the attachment disorder thing as much.  No contact with my family, a thousand miles away.

psychology,eswlzhw,t1_eswiwef,1562317028.0,"I think I got to the highest spiritual plane on Easter Sunday... of all days as an atheist.  Realizing my mother never, ever loved me, or even cared for me.  So abused by my father and brother and family of origin.  My dad and brother had NPD... I finally realized.

Everyone close in my life was completely selfish.  I was the exact opposite.  I had some kind of collective world view where I shared everything or felt I owned nothing.  To a weird degree and way, I still don't understand.  It was pathalogical.  I gave mostly not expecting any return, but I kind of did emotionally.  Not keeping score like a narc.... but kinda.  

Somehow I saw my life and everything all wrong for 43 years.  

From that day... I am purely selfish.  I am the entire universe.  No one really knows anything either.  Everything I know or anyone does is made up bullshit.  Even science, though I believe in science.  Even Einstein never believed in it truly.  He was wrong on trying to unite physics... even if he figured out both macro and micro levels more than anyone.  No one really knows anything, it is a guess work.  

Yet I am full in just being myself.  I want nothing from anyone else but to enjoy them being themselves.  I have some money, I don't need anything from anyone.  I can be purely selfish and not ever want to hurt or manipulate or take anything from anyone ever.  Just accept everyone as they are.  I can be purely selfish like a narcisisst, but literally not need anything.  Want anything from anyone.  Be friends and hopefully find a life partner.  And just enjoy other people.  I never wanted to take from others, but I couldn't be fully myself until I realized I am all that matters. 
I also realized I am an anarchist.  I hate authority.  Yet I feel for all and everyone is equal to me.  Not better or worse intrinsically.  Just different.  I will help anyone willingly... if I can.  But will be manipulated by no one.  I like people.  I hate rules and so much about the organiztion of society we have now.  My battle now is on how much effort to devote to changing that.  I literally have enough materially.  I don't need more.  I have a beautiful small house and small car and a good bike.  An awesome dog.  In a first world country.  I don't even need that much to maintain what I have.  It is a lot about others.... but I choose that fully.  Not out of guilt (was a big issue), or anything.  It just seems like helping others is the only thing that has much true value to me.  I did it before in an unhealthy way, now... not so much.  But I am trying to figure out how best to do that.  

It was a weird place to be.  I feel I should have known this at like puberty, maybe others do?  But most people seem blind to everything really.  Maybe I had to care and suffer and think so deeply about everything the mindfully and conciously realize this. Others do it naturally and don't need to actually do it with actual thought and actions and realize it.  I am both gifted and retarded at the same time.  Usng those terms as words that mean a specific thing.  Retarded is a great word that you almost can't use.  I used it as an insult in my teens to others.  But it totally fits here, so I used it.  And defended using it."

I smoke and not having a window at least to outside, in this 6 bed hospital pysch ward, was worse than not smoking... really quickly I felt that.  The staff was behind glass.  No one talked to you or looked at you.  All the other people locked up were asleep or tied to their beds.  It was solitary confinement, with a bubble of people looking at you.  By the second night I was in terror, at the staff maybe shooting me full of meds I didn't need.  Starting to hyperventilate and control my breathing.  All I wanted was to be outside.  Not the stale broken air of the hospital.  There was no shower or deodorant allowed. I started to stink, I was sweating in fear.  They said they would release me the next morning.  My abusive family put me there, for telling the other side of the family about the abuse.  All I wanted was to be free, I was leaving town and my house was sold.  Freedom, true freedom was days away, and I am locked in a dirty disgusting place, stinking, even trying to wash my armpits... I was in so much terror and stress I could not stop sweating.

The desire for sunlight or even the moon. Just being outside... even trumped my anger at the situation, physical pain I was in, nicotine withdrawl, revenge.... nothing mattered but being outside.  Nothing.  The last ten hours of the 43 I spent there... were controlling my breathing and panic and only thinking of being outside.

""I would say personal anecdotes should be posted with caution and as always with an eye toward initiating a particular discussion about a wider issue""

I did.  And got exactly what the wider issue was.  

This all helped me.  

I didn't talk of the sadist night nurse at the pysch ward that had dead eyes and might be a serial killer like the rare cases we see in hospitals.  

You have no idea of the trauma I went through, or how sick pychiatry is.  A none insignifant number of people in the profession are literally evil and are there to manipulate and hurt broken people as a fetish.  Like 2-10% is my guess.  The person I attacked is among the 35% estimate that literally don't care and are arrogant assholes as doctors.  Surgeons and Pyschiatrists are literally the worst.  One nearly killed me.

I take it personally... because they hold people's lives in their hands.  It is no joke.  It isn't intellectual banter.  If you don't care and put down any patients, you are a piece of garbage in my mind. He put down me and the Schizophrenic that posted here a few days ago.  So it was on.  

I am in this pysch ward talking to two people that needed to be there, at the end of some pyschotic rampage.  I talked to them and calmed them down.  I saw them.  They weren't dangerous.  They were interesting and truly had been abused every day of their life.  

The entire staff did not care, didn't do shit.  I was thinking these are the most interesting and hurt people.  Just like anyone else... and the entire hospital treated them like garbage.  As if they were child molestors.  Like everyone treats the homeless.  But it was a fucking hospital.  Where is the hippocratic oath?  I have it.. and I was a victim of my family in being there, and had much experience as a patient... with many great people tht helped me or tried to.... and that third of people that don't care... and the true evil that lurks in the profession too.

I am not saying even 10% of what happened.  I am angry as fuck.  I am empath.  I know when someone does not give a fuck.  You give a fuck.  Doesn't mean I like you or whatever.  But I respect what you did here.

I am realizing I can't really post on Reddit at this point.  But I won't take being put down or acting like I am a weak piece of shit by a so-called doctor.  Talking down to me.  At this point... I talk down to doctors.. if I get any whiff of bullshit.  

I am so angry at authority.  And I care so much.  I did the doctors work... talking down people... and they put on gloves... to feed a guy that was preening and in a meltdown in front of me... while he told me his life story... the staff in fear of him, behind glass... letting me talk to him...me not knowing his bloody hands had hepatitis. I wasn't afraid.  He was my friend immediately... because I listened to him.  He wasn't going to hurt anyone.. and hadn't. he punched walls in his rage at unending abuse, before he was in the hospital.  There he never did anything but was elevated on drugs like crazy.  That continued in a fucking hospital, more abuse.  tied to a bed when he didn't need to be... where they are supposed to help you.  But it is all subdoing people.  

I am so angry about it... I can't even comprehend.  I call out the nurse.  ""You let me stand there with this guy bouncing around and preening and you put on gloves to feed him?""  Dead eyes and he threatened to drug me.  I couldn't even say a thing.  

That is what pychiatry of the very mentally ill is.  this talking down to me about my experience.  I can sense he doens't give a fuck.  so fuck him.  If I am wrong and he is a doctor for real... then he has heard it all before."

It was a week later actually.

I could only warn as I was leaving the city because of a fear of something like this happening. Worse, my friend was with me at the hospital, she went to look after my dog, it was gone.  My parents who I went no contact with had gone to my house used a key and taken my dog to look after him.  My friend is traumatized searching for my dog.

I am around police, but I can't charge them, because I spent 36 hours in a pych ward, getting treated and assessed if I am violent.  When I haven't ever been violent.  Having asshole doctors trying to shoot me full of meds, telling me to not use weed, which 100% legal in Canada, not an issue, and what finally cured me of the hold and delusions of my insane abusive family and getting off pysc meds and being healthy, because I wasn't crazy or bipolar, it was ALL CPTSD from decades of abuse like this.

PsychMelee,essptkw,t1_esshfrh,1562255827.0,"This happened to me for years.  On cipralex and later seroquel.

&#x200B;

Honestly I still have complex PTSD.  I need to calm down sometimes from being in peak alertness and from being shattered and not being able to think clearly.  After decades of abusing alcohol, the only thing that works is beer and weed.  As I recover more.  I drink less often, and I drink only beer.  I don't get shit faced drunk, but after a day or two or three, I can't sleep at night, drink 6 beers and I sleep, then wake and sleep some more.  It lasts far longer than the alcohol is in my system.

Weed was my recovery stimulis.  I was so numb and in cognitive dissonance, I could not function. Barely left the house.  I was 205 lbs, and I am 140 now less than 18 months later after getting off seroquel and no contact with my abusive family.  I walk 20000 steps a day.  15 kms.  Just normally.  Without trying to do it.

I went from using 2-3 grams a day a year ago when I started using weed, to around a half gram, in vaporizers now, and I don't use any weed somedays.  I don't ""need"" it, but I might in the winter or if I get depressed or can't feel my feelings.

Weed made me not numb. And beer makes me connect to my feelings and calm down to be able to write things.

It isn't ideal, and I bought a new home in a new city I move into on Monday.  I have been essentially homeless for a month.  At campgrounds and motels, with money to pay for anything I need.  But truly homeless, without people I know.  Only my dog.  I think my drinking and weed use will evaporate soon after I have a home a home and a place in the world I make.  I try to stop using and after a few days, I am going through the PTSD windmill of Fight, flight, freeze, fawn.  I know I am not addicted to either. Not physically anyway.  I know health wise and historically, these are substances I don't want to use nearly daily.  But I need them to not be squirelly.  I use them in the evening, I never drive when intoxicated.

I ended up in a pysch ward at the end of June for 43 hours because my abusive family said I was violent to ruin my home sale, not let me leave the city, despite no contact in 2019, and try to institutionalize me.  The doctors there were trying to get me to take valium, which I was on from doctors forcing me, during my only suicide attempt.  Alcohol in a pill is better than drinking 6 beers and controlling my dose of water based depressant that goes away in hours?  How? How is valium a good thing for me?   They kept saying the weed was making me elevated... as I was locked in a pysch ward for violent people, with 4 beds and no windows to outside.  Really a prison, no shower, no going outside, no cigarettes so nicotine withdrawl, another thing I hope to end soon.  Are you fucking insane I thought.  I had to stay longer because I was honest about my substance use too, I am pretty sure.  Proving I am not violent, when I have no history of it, am looking after myself fine, selling my house, functioning like a normal person.  The fact I ws using weed in Canada, when it is fully legal, was this massive problem to them.  Like that was why I was angry at being taken by the police to a prison pysc ward, while I was selling my house and under massive stress. And physically having back pain.  I was saying shit like this.  In fucking righteous anger.  Not throwing things or acting out, but I was so pissed off, I didn't respect them, I said all the things I am saying here essentially.  This was my number fear in the world, I had a lawyer drawing up Power of Attorney papers at the time to stop my family from having anything to do with my health decisons, and giving them to a friend that actually cares about me and knows me.  43 hours.  In basically prison solitary.  And they are focused on the weed.  And pumping me full of meds.  I managed to not get forcibly medicated, if I had it might have taken weeks to recover.  Not hours like beer or weed.  They literally know shit about much at all.  They acted like I was crazy, when really they were and the system is.  So narcissitic and stupid.  I am as smart and know as much as the doctors about me.  But I get treated like a homeless vagrant with a 90 IQ.  I care so much about my health and welfare, yet get treated like I am a reckless dangerous addict.  It is absurd what pyschiatry is at this point.  

&#x200B;

I am not anti-meds, but I have lived it and seen it in others.  they label ""addiction"" and give you meds that fuck up your brains hunger function and everything in your head.  they act like it is all normal and safe and not  ""heavy"" drugs like Lithium.  But they are.  they are worse than vodka.  they fuck up everything in your brain and no one know what will happen when different individuals use them. They are last resort meds.  Yet doctors act like they are the first thing to try.

If I drink 2 liters of beer or vape a quarter gram of weed. I know exactly what will happen, it always happens.  I am not very intoxicated, enough not to drive even if it was legal or I felt safe doing it.  But I not all fucked up.  I do chores and write and walk my dog and stop being shattered and having emotional deregulation.  It goes away in hours.  Seroquel fucked up my ability to eat properly.  I was starving all the time.  Antidepressants made me not able to have a long hard erection, in my 30's.  So numb I didn't understand my family was abusing me emotionally in massive ways.

&#x200B;

Walking, biking and moderate substance use, made me recover a ton.  And pysch meds made me immeasurably worse for a decade.  I was too numb to think of suicide.  and I never do now.  That is the only positive thing they did.  I started them when I was suicidal. over a decade ago.  From abuse and PTSD I realize now.  Those meds kept me from realizing it for a decade.

I got to meet David, understood his delusions, also I was the only person that talked to him, not the doctors or nurses or anyone. It was sickening. In some emergency room holding tank pysch ward, for people in pychosis and dangerous to others.

I told David when I get to the ocean, I will sit in the sand and think of him.  I don't think he will feel it, but maybe he will.  I don't know, but he is my friend from an hour conversation. He was gifted in communication, I know half his life story. And the doctors didn't know shit, they just pumped him full of drugs.  He was a beautiful person. The only upside of the whole experience, where I have PTSD in essentially a prison, where they send people to calm down.  43 hours inside, not letting them force me to take drugs, a sociapathic if not murderous night nurse, who talked to everyone like they were 4 and wanted to shoot them all up with meds. 

Schizophrenia give you trauma, like he says, in the wilderness, it probably would be a lot freaking different experience, everything in society is loud and hateful towards them, no wonder halluciantions are negative of paranoid.  It is like taking acid and almost always having a bad trip because you shunned, over medicated and homeless or living in squalor because no one helps you.

I read someone else say ""not being my true self is physically painful"" It is true, and I apparently can't post on Reddit because of it.

Saying my post above that in r/politics would get me banned. No matter what, a person on the side of cruelty will ban me for saying the truth as I see it.  about anything it seems.  The truth is banned in the USA. Like the Two Live Crew song of my teenage years.

I am not paranoid, it is real, no one is allowed to be fully honest about themselves. If you do, you are shunned, because you make people see themselves, and they don't like that.

It is not as bad in person at first.  But I see into people, and they know it too. I don't want to, but I am hyper sensitive to others, and always was trying to figure out the feelings of my father so he would not rage, and other people because I didn't understand anyone as a child with no parents really.  I get overwhelmed around people a lot, but I love being around people, but I have been isolated so long.  So in the depth of PTSD I could use a pen and write, or even focus, less than a year ago.

I don't know how to wear a mask anymore, and I am starting over in a new house and city on Monday. I am not nervous, but apparently I can't not be my full self, get super excited, be really emotional. But also intellectual about everything. I am 43 years old and finally love being me.  I don't seem to know how to fit in properly, even in this subreddit.

I don't even care what people think either, I just don't want to seem like a lunatic and make some friends, I don't really know how I appear at this point, enough to get banned over nothing, but it must FEEL like something to someone so badly, to get that upset.

Getting kicked out of a support group you contributing great content to, is pretty freaking lame.  It is actually awful.  I always think... this could happen to someone else if I don't stand up for myself. But finally I actually am standing up for myself, and I can't NOT do it.  No matter how diplomatically I do it, I get banned."
raisedbynarcissists,esr9fi4,t1_esr6io7,1562219677.0,"You are projecting, and you have literally no facts to back you up.  What source? why should I trust those numbers?  Look how many gay people there are, and trans people.  Do you think in 1980 many estimates would have been correct when so many were closeted?

I would love a source, not insults.  Accusing me of what you are doing.  I said it twice in this thread.  And I tried to write with as much clarity as I could.  You don't even have a number.  I likely know 100 times more than you about the subject, and you act like the expert.  And provide little content yourself.  You just attack because you don't agree or don't really understand.  

It is so frustrating, and even proves my point more, because so many of us pick up traits of the narcs.  I am a straight empath.  I didn't even realize that empaths were real.  But I am one.  Not in a way that many claim to be, some kind of mystical figure. I understand where people are coming from, I just studied people all the time, because nothing in my life ever made sense, not really.  I attracted so many people with NPD. Never a romantic relationship, but so many.  I obviously attract them, because of the nature of my family of origin, and being in 12 step groups and so on. But there are a lot of them. I know there are.  Far more than people understand. 3 father within 2 blocks where I grew up in a town in Ontario that was upper middle class.  My childhood friends.  In my small gifted class in middle school. 2 of the 10 had NPD, and I was who they bullied. It is not rare. Not at all.  I really want to know is it 2% or 12%.  

Please I would love to see your source.  I know estimates exist, I truly want to know where you heard that.  But your the one who can't literally have an adult conversation about this, or maybe anything. You are just too angry and pigheaded.  But you truly believe I am.  Narc abuse is such a mind fuck.  Neither of us are over it. But I am fully self aware of how I act, and you really aren't."

She is among the top lawyers in my country, but she is a shattered person.  She has never got over any of it, and is still in contact with them.  

I felt rage from that, reading your story.  It hurts me, that my friend, not even a close one, is still living with all the trauma, drinking too much, in a terrible relationship, put down for being a failure, every time she talks to her mom.

It seems like your mom has your back.  I only read the one thing you posted.  So from what I can see, you are going to be ok.  it isn't both of your parents that are broken.  I am so happy that you are protected from this.  I said what I did, because I know that this kind of evil exists.  My uncle groomed my brother and I, sort of.  exposed us to sick pornography, when I was around 15.  it was before there was internet porn, in the 1980's, beastiality videos and he had all of these of my aunt, who is a normal nice person who fell under the spell of an evil narcissist and ruined her and then committed suicide.  she recovered.  Married a nice man.

I didn't spare your feelings and was so direct, because you did nothing wrong.  I told our parents about my uncle right away, and we never talked about it again.  Ever.  They lived 6 hours away and I never saw him again.  They did nothing.  They didn't care.  
if your mom cares about you and your dad is out of your life, hopefully you won't need to know any horrible things that you can't forget or get over entirely.  I am so glad you seem to be seeing what you are in the thread.  

Your dad can't help himself.  It isn't personal, he is just very, very sick in the head and will never change.  The place for him is in prison or at least not anywhere near you."

There are a lot of low functioning ones, but so many powerful people had full NPD.  Because they lack empathy, they end up running half the world.  And ruining it, and killing millions.  Not all war is from this, but so much of it is.  Michael Jordan, full NPD.  Cosby... thinking full NPD, the entire cabinet of the top narc in the world now, ALL NPD.  Every one of them.  So many doctors, wall street is full of them.  Religious leaders, cops.

I mean full NPD, alot of it very malignant.  How many have NPD? 

Even if I am wrong, and it is 2%, they gravitate to the places they should least be.  They all destroy dozens of lives, or millions, they cause so much trauma, 2nd and 3rd generations are shattered by it, it spreads like a virus, and they always team up with each other, the high functioning ones.  

And I am not talking naricssitic people, full NPD.  So many are under the spell of them, messed up, so the mess up their kids because of NPD being anywhere in the family.

I have realized no one knows or talks about any of this.  Only people here and people focus on that one famous guy that lives in Washington, not everything else.

raisedbynarcissists,esqv65e,t1_esozpso,1562210493.0,"Having autism is similar to having NPD.  I think.  It is very different, but imagine a person without autism, acting like they have it, and anyone that doesn't exactly what they want, when they want it... is causing them so much pain.  So they hate everyone and everything, but theyn actually fully understand emotions, and use them to destroy everyone close to them, and want to appear perfect to anyone they are not close to.  

They are evil.  Pure evil.  imagine the Devil.  Or the current President.  They literally make up their own version of reality, and it can change in a moment to something else.  They both believe their own lies, and know they are lying.  It is so pathalogical it is hard to comprehend.  

I read you were autistic, I thought you were a narcisist posting here.  I thought my dad was autistic for awhile, because the he acts like he is in his own bubble, but he is just a covert narc, who doesn't hide it really.  he bullies everyone into agreeing with him, so no one talks about anything that matters.  

I realized my mom is of above average intelligence, and she acts like she is mentally retarded.  I use the term specifically to mean that.  no one listens to her, she used her kids as a shield, she also acts autistic to, as a victim, and really a co-abuser by not acting like an adult and mothering her children.  My dad didn't beat or rape us.  He just made everything about him.  We were his slaves.  My mom cooks, I do chores..etc.  He treated us like pets essentially.  I guess trying to give each of us something... but what he decided was right... not even knowing anyone else.  but when challenged he would bully is way into no one talking about anything.  He hated himself so much, yet thinks he is the smartest man in the world.  If you challenges him he just swears and acts like such an asshole.  he does it to all cashiers, waiters etc.  Anyone ""below"" him in hiererchy.  If he can get away with it.

I am not saying everyone's symptoms aren't totally real, or that some meds for some people aren't needed.  

I am saying the entire world and medical community and everyone for the most part doesn't understand anything.  The DSM is ridiculous. The treatments of most mental illnesses make little sense.  I am not saying people can easily get over lifelong trauma and their symptoms. I am saying the entire system and langauge and society in general is fucked uo about the entire idea of mental illness.

Plus there are so many people with NPD.  They aren't that rare.  That why so many people have these mental illnesses.  The problem is parents with NPD.  Or the grandparents.  Lots of parents aren't evil or have NPD, but they grew up in it and don't know how to parent correctly, and they unwittingly damage their children too.  It is all narcs, all the way down.

I am realizing lots of mental illnesses are not that real.  All of it is Complex Post Traumatic stress disorder.  I even through most diagnosed Borderline's in that group, anyone that has bipolar 2 not 1, is possibly living through unreolved trauma all the time, anxiety disorders, depression in general, agoraphobia.  

NPD is pyschopathy but having feelings, and projecting all their self hatred at everyone else.  They feel a lot, but it is all negative and projected outward to everyone else, they pick a few shame buckets.  

I am not trying at all to tell you what your reality is, it just is screaming at me, that you aren't really seeing what is there.  But like me the terms you use are kinda fluid not DSM terms.  Diagnostic Manual pychitrists use is the DSM.

I can relate so much to your entire life story, as little as I can see in a handful of posts, so I am only saying this to you, because I am pretty certain about it, and it might help you better see your reality.  If anything, you and I are more classically borderline than bipolar.  but we thought bipolar.  and it is CPTSD really.  Fight, flight, freeze, fawn.  In a way I am finding a way to ""fawn"" with you right now.  

My emotional deregualtion keeps happening, but I am completely self aware of it.  I am living in a campground, waiting to move into my forever house in a new city, a thousand miles from anyone I know on Monday.  

I feel a deep connection to you.  But I don't even know you.  but I care, I relate to you so much, and I think I might have some kind of genious insignt of an empath into all kinds of mental illness, because I went to 12 step groups and mental illness groups for a decade and a half trying to figure myself out... and it was always my family.  I have met hundreds and hundreds of people with mental illness and talked to them extensively, they were all my friends and people I knew.  Yet I could never get it was all my family of origin.  I got drawn back into my family in my early 30's to be part of a family business.  It destroyed me, made me think I was bipolar and my family made 10-20 million dollars.  And ruined my life.  

We might never chat again, and it would painful for me not to tell you what I did, because I deeply know it is true.  And I wanted to share my experience and my story of moving into a new house in a quiet, beutiful city of like 20,000 people in the middle of no where.  Where people act mostly like people.  

I am still half fucking shattered, and recovered.  I am writing a book.  Living Paradox.  Everything in my life is the opposite of what I thought it was.  I think what you think about that shit bag ex, the ""label"" you attach to him is always borderline.  I ruined myself attatching labels to myself.  We are all just human beings.  But I think the label of NPD is clear.  it is like a pyschopath.  Everyone with NPD is the exact same.  At the core.  Every other disorder/mental illness is confusing and really shouldn't be labeled.  They mostly don't really exist in the way the medical community thinks they do, the meds are terrible, they are worse than the disorders unless you are Schzophrenic or Bipolar 1... it is really confusing and the ""labels"" make it worse.  Trump has Malignant Narcissitic Personality Disorder.  Every single Narc acts exactly like he does.  it is just how well they hide it, how intelligent or wealthy they are.  You ex is a woman beating, leech.  he has Malignant NPD.  he just does. He wants you to die.  A Borderline wants you to love them.  Period.

I know Borderline people, they don't act at all like I am hearing your ex acts.  Maliganant NPD does that.

In fact I thought I was bipolar myself, and I realized the emotional deregualtion and attachment disorder that I seemed to have, because neither parent loved me at all, or even washed me or taught me how to comb my hair or brush my teeth or anything, at all.  I really had CPTSD, but thinking I had bipolar 2, I acted more like I had borderline, except no self harm or anything, but romantically I would fall in love super quickly, had boundary issues with people, because I never had boudaries.  oversharing.  but I never acted ""to get attention"".  I wasn't angry or jealous or anything, but really I acted with a lot of borderline traits.  but not that poorly.  but I wouldn't date for years at a time, because I knew I would irrationally fall in love so easily, and I am pretty awesome in many ways, so I knew I could easily make someone fall for me too, and it would end up being the wrong thing and we both get hurt. Feeling in love was like being on cocaine or hypomanic.  

I am saying it from experience.  the Borderline's I know, do things like talk about their suicide attempts, in recovery they do it... to get anyone that doesn't understand their reality, to run away.  they are testing that they can be themselves around friends or family or in dating.  The all grew up in NPD families.  Every borderline person.  and they are just a mess, because the cognitive dissoanace and love bombing and hating and craziness, makes no sense.  I dated a few girls with Borderline, and they never were abusive to me.  One broke up with me abruptly, apparently for good reason, it was through her, meeting her parents, and seeing it was just like my house was growing up, but even more empty of emotion.  That triggered so much insight, my recovery, going No Contact.

This happened to me too.  I realized my brother was also had malignant narcissism.  always had.  Even in my childhood.  He tricked me into fights to get me in trouble and everyone acts like that was literally the only problem in the family ever.  Me before puberty.  When I did nothing really.  

My brother got me put in a 72 hour pysch hold, that lasted 43 hours until I convinced them I was not violent and going to kidnap my brother's children.  he thought he would ruin my home sale, but it was on the 6th not the last or first day of the month.  I could not even move away apparently.  

I still can't fully comprehend how evil my entire family is.  pure evil.  All the ways I felt them ""off""... but the depths of it, was beyond me.  I literally could not understand it, until I understood everything."

It is why we have Trump.  People don't know what Narcissism is.  They can't see Trump.  And the narcs team up.  The high level ones do.  Pretty much all thetop Republican leaders have NPD just like Trump.  The Fox News people.  

&#x200B;

I say this because the culture of abuse is America.  So many religious leaders too.  You aren't allowed to sad or even angry.  At anything that matters.  you accept the abuse at work or church or home.  

&#x200B;

These people stole all political power and ""normal"" people don't even understand what is really happening.   Because no one really talks about or knows about NPD abuse.  but it is what almost all abuse comes from.  NPD caused the 2008 collapse of the markets, the Iraq war disaster.... because those at the top wouldn't listen to anyone about how shitty an idea it was.  the decision in the first place, but the implementation too.  Cheney. NPD.  Trump's entire cabinet has NPD.  

&#x200B;

Now that I am getting over my families abuse, I can't not see every person with NPD and the destruction they leave around them.  individuals or society itself.  

&#x200B;

And the core reason, is what you said in your post, you can't talk about or share real feelings or expect any empathy from anyone.  it isn't like that in other countries, not the same way anyway.  I realized it was true in AA.  and Bill Wilson had NPD.  the Big Book is a ""cure"" for NPD.  the 12 steps.  except Bill Wilson stopped drinking and kept abusing.  He didn't cure himself, he created a cult like Lenin or Stalin.  To himself.  Never question AA doctrine either.  Because NPD. 

&#x200B;

Maybe all of us need to tell everyone me see about our abuse, save the world.  I don't know.  I need to find a way to tell everyone about narcs, before the USA goes Nazi.  It is so close."
politics,espnl5o,t3_c8o7ns,1562187067.0,"America is evil.  Always has been.  Trump won because he knows a third of people love cruelty and live to hate.  The question is whether America goes full Nazi or not.  You have a Congress that won't even impeach him because it might be a bad ""political"" move.  Few seem to grasp exactly where America is at.  
You need to stop this shit now.  There may not be a 2020 election.  The sane people aren't stopping it.  Everyone is chicken shit or deluded with American exceptionalism.  The USA can't go Nazi, they think, yet it is already run by Nazi's.  Fox News is straight Nazism.  Some of their top shows are done by actual Nazi's.  Laura Ingraham did a Nazi salute at the Republican Convention,  global fascism is what the CPAC was all about.  Needed the more crazy Le Pen to speak.  Trump said his dad was born in Germany, not out of dementia, it was a purposeful call out to Nazi's.

You better wake the fuck up."

This is a war between empathy and cruelty.  The Republicans, every one of them at this point want an American version of Nazism.  They want to kill everyone that is not like them.  Or deport like a 100 million people.  That is what is happening.  AOC understands that fact and says the fucking truth every time she talks.  Lots of Dems still don't grasp where America is at.  This is worse than the 1960's.  Less violence in the streets.  Everyone is mollified into being polite and not realizing this is Germany in 1936. ICE is the fucking true Gestapo.  Comcentration camps exist for children,  children.  

We need fucking violence at this point.  The proper thing to do with Nazi's and those with malignant Narcissism, is to cull them from society.  by any means necessary.  Unless you want millions or even billions worlwide to die at the world hegemon military and economic power going full Nazi.  No one can stop the USA.  Not NATO or China. And Russia is also fucking Nazi under Putin.  Nazi/fascist... it doesn't matter the words.  there will be death camps and Mexico will start getting attacked.  civil right will end like in Captain America Civil War.  Canada will be taken without much war, like Austria was.  

this shit is straight Hydra.  They need to be stopped.  They are the taliban as well as fuckin Nazi's.  Pence is the taliban and Trump is Hitler. Putin is Stalin.  This shit is going to get so much worse.  If Trump polls under 40% by October 2020... they will try to stop the election, or win by outright fraud that is obvious to everyone."
