I say this because they have not set themselves up to be a trustworthy authority, despite being a large space agency.  (An example of a reason I find them untrustworthy is that we have no photos of earth, only cgi recreations, if you look at this iconic image and read on how it was created, you'll see it's not a photo:  [https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/about/people/RSimmon.html](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/about/people/RSimmon.html) 

...despite the fact it's typically said to be a photo. Other images exist, but they're also similar in that they're recreations of earth's topography superimposed on a sphere.

NOTE: I AM NOT SAYING YOU OWE ME ANYTHING (sorry for all caps, but this is important to understand) You don't need to send me evidence, I'm just saying feel free if you do beleive it's not difficult to tell what's legit and what's fake. Saying that *it's easy* to tell what's real or not would be false. Just to keep in mind, I would say like *75-80% of proofs I see for a flat earth are stupid and also demonstrable false*. However, there are still points that cannot be ignored that point to something being off about what we are told. 

Much of the evidence I've seen for the globe earth, for the most part, can be refuted (not all of it, a fair bit is  intriguing and makes sense). *The same thing applies to evidence I've seen for the earth either being flat or way bigger than we are told*, hence why I say, ""It's really hard to tell what is true and what isn't"", because evidence is sketchy on *either side*. (And I'll be honest, a fair bit of sketchiness on the flat earth front, just not enough to make me deny the sketchiness on the globe earth as well)."

The aforementioned video you'll find in the youtube recommendations does not, however, address several important points for the earth either being bigger or flat, the most prominent in my mind is: the fact we can see farther than what should be possible. I *personally don't know what to think*, (don't want to say I'm a flat earther, as I do believe that the idea is rather preposterous) however, I'm really not a fan of the toxic behaviour I see online, especially in this subreddit, of people shitting on others for questioning the narrative we have all been given on a platter by our governments and educational systems.

TrueChristian,f7b0rwa,t3_dv2516,1573549355.0,"These are good questions. I can answer #7 ATM: Although I was raised Christian, I didn't really come to a deeper faith until I was looking more into Christianity, Christian philosophy, studying scriptures and church history. I was put in a situation in high school where I was exposed to other beliefs and religions and I didn't know what was true anymore. As I said, I grew up Christian, so I believed in some kind of God, but with the other worldviews polluting my mind I was more leaning into believing in some kind of impersonal God. And then after high school I studied Christianity more deeply and understood that Jesus Christ plays a central role in all of this. Jesus wasn't just ""some prophet"" as other religions try to say- He was so much more. The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. In Christ's act of laying down His life for us we can see what God is like. He is altruistic, other-oriented. That charitable love is core to Christianity and what God is like. WE see in nature animals fight, its a dog eat dog world. And then humanity pretty much has the golden rule, ""you don't punch me I don't punch you"". Christianity changes it all and puts active love into it.""DO unto others as you would have them do to you"". God took the first step towards us in Jesus, and it all made sense and spoke to my heart."

I've been crying and praying to God for reassurance and all that, but you can't have Him just give you reassurance at the snap of a finger- because where is the faith? Jesus says  “Thomas, because thou hast seen Me, thou hast believed. *Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed.*” (John 20:29) . I want CERTAINTY, but that desire for certainty in God comes from my pride. Faith is important because with it you freely submit to God and He can work through your life. God's timing is the best timing. Don't lose faith and hold on! Don't pray for, ""God reassure me you're here"", rather pray that God will help you see where He is in your life already, instead of making Him reveal himself to you on your own terms.
