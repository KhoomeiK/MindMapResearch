SuicideWatch,fl96zx2,t1_fl0ewrt,1584943224.0,"hello everybody above i know i am a stranger over the internet and I myself am in a lot of pain currently my friend killed himself one month and five days ago and trust me i count every day and write notes to him atleast once every week since, and i understand the pain i truly do i myself have found myself faced with the edge of a building feeling like i’m one step away from freedom but i encourage all of you above to stick around and i hope all of you see this i really do because i am currently dealing with my own guilt but you were not put here to bring guilt to others you were not put here to suffer and who is to say if any of us are here for any particular reason at all, but being a biological organism is a struggle and some days i feel like my own existence simply brings me pain but you have the power to show empathy and you have the power to move on past this and see all of the beauty that life has to offer but you have to take a step away from any of your circumstances in life or social obligations that may even feel like torture sometimes, but you need to be able to step away and realize that this too shall pass some scenarios pass with more pain and suffering or even less then the last and trust me there will never be a shortage i am 19 and i feel like i’ve lived a thousand lives of suffering and joy and i’ve attempted to commit suicide more times then i can count on my fingers and toes but you are all beautiful amazing people and one day everyone is bound to find their purpose, and until then if anyone reading this needs anything or anybody to talk to i am always free and it’s the internet you’ll find a way to reach me if you feel like you need it but if any of you think that you’re going to hurt yourselves i know it’s a lot to trust in a stranger but i’m always here for a good conversation, take care of yourselves"
