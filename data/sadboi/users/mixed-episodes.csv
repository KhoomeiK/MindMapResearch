Medications react differently for different people. Try not to stress out after one episode of throwing up. I have had meds that made me terribly nauseous (one was so bad that I woke myself up from sleep gagging), but often that side effect would lessen over the first 2-4 weeks until it was gone completely. This is why it is important to give a new medication at least 3-4 weeks after first starting unless you have some very bad reactions to it. 

Try to keep track when you feel sick or actually get sick. How long between the symptoms and your last dose, how long did the symptoms last, how severe, did you eat (and if so what) before, with, or after your medication. If it continues or worsens or you get concerned definitely contact your doctor to be on the safe side."
