Your friend sucks for making a “low blow” kinda joke and for not communicating that she was upset about being the center of jest in your group.

Anxiety,fisunh7,t3_f9o1xe,1582693862.0,"So this happened to me within the last two months. Most of my anxiety had been panic surrounding social situations or health. But then around Christmas time, it switched to more of what you’re describing. I was having intrusive and unwanted thoughts of harming others and sometimes it was more intense in imagery than others. I started FREAKING out because I’ve never experienced anything like it before. I got into a cycle for a month of thinking I was crazy, I would become violent toward others or myself. I finally spoke up about it in therapy and it’s been a slow process of getting back to my baseline. What my therapist and I processed is that it’s just another form of catastrophizing my thoughts, especially since I’ve made strides in my social and health anxiety distortions. I’m not going to downplay the severity and make it seem like it was easy to get over (because it was probably one of the most miserable times of my life), but as I started working on it, I treated it similar to how I cope with other distortions. Even though it was terrifying to be thinking these horrible things, I knew I had no intention of ever acting on the thoughts or images I was having. The thoughts always came as a “what if” scenario. So I started practicing this thing where if I experienced an intrusive thought I would replay it in my head by saying “what if _________” and then follow it up with “That’s a what if. Here is what I know about myself and why that would not happen.” It’s taking me a bit to try and get back on track, but I’m making improvements. I know it’s hard, but you got this!"

As far as medication goes, I kind of had a similar thing. I went to my primary care physician to discuss my anxiety after about three years in therapy and trying everything under the sun (except meds) to cope. He was very receptive to what I had to say and at one point said I was a good candidate for meds because even though I had tried everything, I was still experiencing anxiety and depression at the time. He said that made him hopeful that meds would be the last little bit in my recovery to get the relief that I had tried working on alone for such a long time. He also noted that it was refreshing to see someone who tried other methods of coping before trying to just get a quick fix with medication and not putting in any of the work. 

So overall, I think the fact that you’re still experiencing symptoms despite your effort should be reason enough for the doctor to consider medication. Hope all goes well no matter what you decide!"

Anxiety,ffvp6ab,t1_ffvo3mb,1580269471.0,"Ah. Well, my friend went through a similar thing with a research paper. Ultimately, she got friends to help support her and sit with her during the writing process to bounce ideas off of and keep her on track if she got panicked. I also encouraged her to just write a paragraph and not worry about the rest. If that’s overwhelming, just a sentence, even if it’s as simple as “my name is....”. The paper doesn’t have to be a final draft right away. You can get some ideas down then go back in and edit when your anxiety lessens. 

If it’s specific to yourself, if you have close friends or family, ask them what they’d write about you. Or ask yourself what positive things you’d write about those close to you. Often times, it’s easier for us to see the positives in others than it is in ourselves. Scholarship essays are all usually about overcoming obstacles or writing about strengths. So think of the strengths you admire in another people to help shape thoughts of what you’d say about yourself. Another helpful tip is just pretending your writing a story about someone who has been through similar things as you. I usually enjoy writing fiction more than anything so it can be a playful and creative way to trick your mind into getting some stuff down that is actually relevant to you. 

Hope that’s helpful. Remember you got it! Good luck and sending positive vibes your way that you get some of that $cholarship money because trust me, I know the student loan debt struggle 😂"
Anxiety,ffvokot,t3_evggzj,1580269044.0,"I had all of these thoughts. I tried out Lexapro and had an awful reaction so decided against serotonin based meds after that because I thought it would alter who I felt I was. 

I wanted to try something different when things got bad again but was reluctant to try Vistaril (my therapist and I agreed this was the best option), but rationalized it by saying it was only an antihistamine and wouldn’t change me any more than Benadryl would. I had a good experience with it, but only take it as needed. 

I’m pretty “high functioning” myself because I can go to work and do daily tasks for the most part but have persistent worry and horrible sleep. I’ve struggled with feeling like other people have it worse so I should just deal with it, until my therapist pointed out to me WHY SHOULD I JUST DEAL WITH IT? That was kind of a wake up call for me in realizing that I was just shaming myself into saying my problems weren’t as important.

Anxiety,fft0t97,t3_ev2qzi,1580201010.0,"This. 100% THIS. I’m currently going through a similar thing, but I try to tell myself that this is the last way anxiety is attempting to get to me and get me back into a really horrible place. 

I’ve never broken through this fear before and I feel like that’s why I have really long periods of doing well, only to get back to feeling really panicked again for awhile. 

Change is uncomfortable, whether positive or negative and anxiety LIVES on discomfort. Best of luck pushing through this anxiety and finding the healing that you deserve. YOU GOT THIS! ❤️"
Anxiety,ffrtszt,t3_eusou4,1580165669.0,"My anxiety peaks once it’s dark, specifically between like 7pm and 9pm. Not really sure why but I’ve used the pattern as a way to remind myself that it’s just anxiety that I need to work through instead of letting it blow up into catastrophic thoughts."
Anxiety,ffrt5xa,t3_euub8p,1580165266.0,"Phone calls are a major source of anxiety for me, so this is a win! Good job!"
Anxiety,ffrsy88,t3_euv6qt,1580165129.0,"Well, I’m actually a therapist and can 100% tell you that I care about all of my clients on a human level. It is my job technically to use the skills that I learned in my masters program to help others, but it is impossible to turn off genuine human care and concern simply because I’m at a job. My clients’ well being and happiness is very important to me, and I often celebrate with them when they have victories or feel sorrow when they experience pain. Hopefully you can continue working with your therapist and build a nice working relationship! Remember we’re people too and despite getting paid to do my job, trust me when I say I don’t do this for the money."

This book is literally the best. It’s helped me through a lot. I’d definitely recommend this to anyone struggling with anxiety."
Anxiety,ffprax7,t3_eujfot,1580102924.0,"Talking to my husband/friends/family, using my weighted blanket, reading, praying, deep breathing, journaling using gratitude prompts, and doing makeup to let some of my creativity flow!"
Anxiety,ffpr5sk,t3_euj8wt,1580102788.0,"It sounds like you need some relief from all the things you carry around in your mind and heart all day long. It may be difficult, but being vulnerable and opening up to others may be helpful. Even if it’s one family member or friend that you sort of test the waters with, you can let someone in to what’s really going on. 

If the barrier to therapy is money, there are resources (at least in the US) where you can receive low cost or even free therapy. Maybe you could explore that option so you can have a therapist to work through some of these anxious thoughts. 

If you don’t feel like you’re ready to take the step into reaching out or getting a therapist, maybe explore some self help books that you can start working on individually. Even though it’s done alone, I’ve always found that it makes me feel understood that someone was able to write about similar experiences."
Anxiety,ffpmezi,t3_eui21r,1580098681.0,"Please never feel like a burden (though I know the feeling and the struggle)! Anxiety THRIVES on making us feel isolated. If your girlfriend is supportive, I’m sure she wants to be there for you and make sure that you’re okay. 

Some things I’ve tried that helped with sleep anxiety: setting a sleep routine and over the counter supplements/meds. 

I found that the best sleep routine for me is ending my day with journaling or reading. It helps get me in a place of gratitude and feeing centered. 

I’ve also tried Valerian root in the past and it helped me fall asleep and stay asleep! I’m prescribed Vistaril now and that KNOCKED me out for awhile ha. 

My other suggestion is to download Headspace. I only use the free meditations but there’s one in particular that I use whenever my mind is racing or I wake up anxious. It’s called “falling back asleep.” If I’m having a rough anxiety night, I do this as a first resource and then if I feel like the anxiety is too great and I need to talk, I wake my husband. It’s helped me relieve that feeling of being a burden that I know I shouldn’t have but is still there sometimes. 

Hope you get to catching some good, restful sleep soon! 😴"
Anxiety,ffplme0,t3_euigby,1580098095.0,"For me, anxiety is knowing that I am capable of so much more, but having such overwhelming fear that it keeps me from reaching my full potential."

This book has saved me through some of the hardest and darkest times of my anxiety. It’s very easy to read and you work through it at your own pace. I worked through it years ago and started again last week since I’ve had another flare up. The way this guy rights is humorous, but informational. And a lot of the techniques are CBT based even if he doesn’t directly call them that most of the time."
Anxiety,ffn2ezh,t3_eu9a3g,1580061260.0,"If you’re a reader, I recommend “Tuesday’s with Morrie.” I was having constant anxiety around death but this book helped shift my perspective. Morrie says “Once we accept that we will die, that’s when we can fully begin to live.”"
Anxiety,ffkc4bc,t3_eu2hlh,1580020341.0,"I asked my doctor for a specific medication when I went in to see him. I actually discussed medication recommendations with my therapist first and we both agreed I only need an “as needed” medication. I asked my doctor for Vistaril and he was perfectly fine with that even though his recommendation was to take Buspar daily. He was weary of prescribing any benzodiazepines because of the abuse potential, but I was opposed to starting that anyway so it didn’t matter. But if you know what worked for you, then you have every right as a patient to discuss it with your doctor and advocate for your healthcare. Some doctors may not listen, but I feel like 1) go in with an open mind and consider their recommendations and 2) if you can’t come to an agreement, then seek a second opinion."
Anxiety,ffkbf2w,t3_eu2nxe,1580020023.0,"I think an anxiety forum is a good place to start to find people struggling with similar things! That’s definitely why I decided to even get on Reddit. As for some of the stuff you’ve discussed, anxiety sucks and it makes us question a lot. I’ve had similar struggles of feeling lonely, but have come to realize that my anxiety WANTS to isolate me. It thrives on fear and if I feel like I have no one, my anxiety can continue to live while I suffer in silence. Not sure what advice I can offer other than saying I understand your struggle and you are definitely not alone in the feelings of anxiousness. Hopefully that is a reminder that we can make connections even in small ways ❤️"
Anxiety,ffkapuc,t3_eu2ro3,1580019706.0,"I’ve had a lot of the symptoms you’ve mentioned, give or take a few, when I have panic attacks. But my panic attacks have sort of shifted over time so the symptoms vary. 

The other thing that might be going on is generalized anxiety/panic attacks mixed with post acute withdrawal. If you were using THC for a long time or even for a short time but in high dosages, your body can go through withdrawal. Typically people don’t associate cannabis use with withdrawal because it’s not as intense as what you’d see with other substances, but chronic THC users can experience some physiological and mood changes as their body adjusts to being cannabis free. The most common ones are usually changes in mood, sleep and appetite. 

And it’s pretty typical that once you have one panic attack, they keep happening because we usually anticipate the worst and do things that keep up stuck in the “panic trick.” 

I would encourage you to discuss this with your physician, possibly get a therapist, and keep using the coping skills you know work, like working out! Hope you find a solution soon!"
Anxiety,ffk7p9z,t1_ffk7jo5,1580018322.0,Nope. Even though looking back I know it would’ve made my life a hell of a lot easier. I was VERY anti-med at the time. But I was having 24/7 worry and panic attacks daily before I started going to therapy.
Anxiety,ffk7300,t1_ffk6w3o,1580017968.0,"I’m prescribed Vistaril right now, but it’s as needed only. I barely started it and I’ve only taken it once. But the anxiety free days were pre medication! That’s what makes me hopeful that I can get back there again!"
Anxiety,ffjnwj7,t3_etzquf,1580002611.0,"I was just talking to my husband about this because right now I’m going through an anxiety flare up. But to answer your question, I’ve had days of zero anxiety, for pretty long stretches and then one day have a bad day or so. It took therapy, social support and some good coping skills, but I got there! I’m looking forward to those days returning again if I keep putting in the work I was before."
Anxiety,ffbcg26,t1_ffalqce,1579759557.0,"I get it. Anxiety tells us some nasty things, even that other people can’t help us or won’t understand or think the worst. I was so hesitant on taking meds for YEARS. Had similar feelings that people would think it was kinda out of nowhere, but I finally talked through the anxiety voice and spoke to my doctor. And it has been the best thing. I landed on Vistaril my second go around (tried Lexapro first, but it was HORRIBLE for me), and it has been a really good experience. It seems silly looking back that I waited so long but I knew I had to do it on my time and when I was ready. Hopefully this is your time and you get the relief you’ve been looking for!"
Anxiety,ffaj07l,t3_esjqt1,1579736906.0,Go you! I’m in the same boat trying to get my life back on track. Good luck and keep that determination. Remember you are resilient ❤️
Anxiety,ffaitsv,t3_esk7la,1579736774.0,"I’ve explained it with a lot of metaphors. I’ve told people to imagine their worst fear and how it makes them feel, then follow up with “well that’s how I feel on a pretty consistent basis whether I’m in danger or not.” 

I also try explaining my symptoms with metaphors. For example, derealization is hard to explain if you’ve never felt it, but my husband was able to understand more when I told him I felt like I was behind glass and I could interact with the world, but felt a disconnection that no one else could sense or see. 

I also get this weird feeling of light pressure in my head when I have panic attacks, and my husband came up with “oh does it feel like someone is filling your head with helium?” Which is the closest I could get to saying what was going on. So now we just say I’m having “helium brain” whenever it happens. 

Anxiety and its symptoms are such a difficult thing to explain to people that even if they want to understand, it still might be tough for them to really grasp. I’ve found that getting creative and trying to describe the feelings in terms of things other people experience (just in a less distressing way) has been the most beneficial. 

Super long, but hope this helps! Take care ❤️"
Anxiety,ffai9g1,t3_esk9jr,1579736367.0,"I get medication through my primary care doctor. I’d encourage you to be honest with your doctor about how much you are struggling with your anxiety so that they can recommend something that will not interact with your other meds. If you feel like your doctor isn’t supportive of that, then I’d seek a second opinion from another physician.  I’ve found that most physicians are fine with prescribing mental health meds now as long as they’re non habit forming. Good luck! 🍀"

Anxiety,felhqos,t3_epsckw,1579222457.0,"I don’t think it’s weird and if you explain why you feel more comfortable with that decision, a good physician will respect that. 

I went and asked my doctor for Vistaril and even though he recommended Buspar, he was still on board with me trying what I felt comfortable with first. It’s always okay and never weird to advocate for our own healthcare 🙂"
