ForeverAlone,fqvytce,t1_fqvmgow,1589688330.0,"I think all of you in this comment section are wrong. I (F21) have been called attractive by people tho I don‚Äôt believe most of it, so that means I have guy to choose from and I can tell you this, it‚Äôs mostly not about the looks. For the record I think the only ugly people around are those that are wicked or something negative from the inside. I also don‚Äôt think the facial structure matters as much as cleanliness, body maintenance and maybe a nice haircut. 

The most important fact is your character, I once watched a tv show in which the man was average, he took care of himself though and what‚Äôs more he was confident and funny, he did it with such elegance that I kid you not I might have fallen in love, I still am. I don‚Äôt know if I conveyed what I had in mind but I hope this helps"
