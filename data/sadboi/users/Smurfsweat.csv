FixedTattoos,f0pp4e7,t3_d63zx2,1568840953.0,"It was originally a feather. I went to a reputable shop, and spent $400-ish on this. The artist does free touch ups, but I'm scared to go back. 

I'm partcially  to blame, I suppose, as I didn't speak up, when I saw so much black being used.

At this point, the only thing I can imagine is a large raven/crow of some sort, as I'm sure other colors are not going to do much for this.

I also picture, going ahead with a half sleeve of some kind, to make all I wish for (Halloween imagery) cohesive. However, if I need to just have big ol roses, so be it.

Thanks in advance, 

Haunted by a Tattoo."
