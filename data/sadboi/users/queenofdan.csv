They say it takes doing something 12 times to become an actual habit. Try walking every day for a half hour twelve times, and I guarantee you‚Äôll see what I mean. Then, keep doing it.

4 years in, and I stopped because I moved.  The weight started coming back on.  I started up that habit again and my weight has been steady since 2014, give or take 5-10 lbs.  moving is the best thing you can do for your metabolism. Aaaaand...WATER!

It makes a mockery of everything the previous 90 day people have struggled with.  It‚Äôs just getting worse every season. Now it‚Äôs mostly made up garbage for ratings.

I wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúnothing‚Äù like she would make me sound.  I stopped going to anything with her after a while.

TwoXSex,fp1q00y,t3_gaogdl,1588244129.0,"Ok I‚Äôm going back in time (quite a bit lol) and I‚Äôm remembering that if he took his hands and moved either my waist or my hips up and down, I would at least know what felt good to him and I could go from there. Eventually you develop certain muscles that will support your movements, but that takes a little time. And being petite adds a bit of a challenge so your movements might feel exaggerated, and of course that feels unnatural.  I promise you though, it will feel awesome eventually! 

Another thing to note is if you lean back just slightly, it adds more pressure for him and feels better for both of you. 

Having him guide you will help the best I believe. Everything I know (in my 50‚Äôs and still a good looking, healthy chick) is because we shared good communication.  Don‚Äôt be shy about asking him what feels good. If you‚Äôre close enough to share naked bodies, you‚Äôre close enough to talk about sex. Lol! Amiright?? ‚ô•Ô∏è"

NoStupidQuestions,foyamdb,t3_ga4qtf,1588168931.0,"I usually glove up and mask up, but a couple days ago I had to get two things at the store but forgot my mask (did have gloves) so I went in and out as quickly as I could (I was one of about 4 people who didn‚Äôt have masks. I‚Äôm a woman, the other three were big tall men).  Well you would have thought I was wearing the scarlet letter!! There actually was a guy who pressed himself up against the shelving as I passed and then he loudly commented to his wife ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs walking around without a MASK!!! ‚Äú.    First of all, that mask is to prevent me from you if I‚Äôm not sick. And I‚Äôm not sick. So I know 5 minutes in and out isn‚Äôt going to kill YOU.  and if you‚Äôre worried about me, I thank you so, kind stranger.  No need to press your body up against food in order to protect me, though.

Some people are insane right now.  We are losing or minds and or social skills."

EstrangedAdultChild,fovev3e,t1_fov8uyk,1588100141.0,"My daughter is extremely defensive of me and she hates my mother.  She‚Äôs stuck up for me in ways I‚Äôll never be able to.  Children learn the truth about their relatives. My son is similar, but more of a peace keeper. 

My mother damaged them both as well. Just because you‚Äôre not there to see it doesn‚Äôt mean its not happening. Keep that in mind. My parents took my kids to Washington DC when they were little (under ten) and n mother actually lost my daughter for a little while at the Abraham Lincoln statue.  My mother was high and too busy enjoying herself and lost track of my kid. My daughter could have easily been taken as it was tourist season. Just remember, your kids are little and cute, but your mom is always the same. There will be a day that they suffer because of her.  My mother screamed at my 6 year old daughter that day and she‚Äôll never forget it. She was crying because she was scared and she was used to feeling safe with her parents.  She didn‚Äôt know what I knew at that age/. I knew it was up to me to keep up with my mother (and I have actually been taken at one point because my mom was asleep somewhere at a lake). I didn‚Äôt know that parents kept you safe.  I thought parents hated you and you better be quiet and be aware of them and their feelings and your surroundings. 

I‚Äôm saying this because your mother will eventually act out on the kids, especially when the stop being cute and start having a voice."
EstrangedAdultChild,foupf01,t1_foui8sy,1588088197.0,"That‚Äôs exactly what she wants you to do.  The most powerful way to respond is to not respond.  It‚Äôs cruel in its own way.  Do not give her what she wants.  Attention.  It will mean you care. No matter what you say, it won‚Äôt change her.  It will only give her fuel to hurt you more because she‚Äôll defend herself.  If a stranger said those things to you, would you keep going back and forth?  No.  You‚Äôd block them.  I urge you to go silent.  Empower yourself."
EstrangedAdultChild,fouoo2e,t3_g9mw1c,1588087831.0,"Please please please just block her.  I did this three years ago and I‚Äôve never felt more free.  She will never be anything but cruel.  It‚Äôs hard to concentrate on your family or your needs when someone is being so cruel, especially the person who‚Äôs supposed to love you and support you the most.  Nothing makes you feel lonelier. 

Don‚Äôt keep that line of communication open for her.  There‚Äôs nothing of value that she‚Äôll ever say to you.  Nothing that will improve your life.  And she‚Äôll never be who you need her to be.   Once you accept that, and once you stop seeing her name pop up anywhere, you will be free.  Do it for your kids if not for you.  My children are all grown, but they have memories of days on end that I had nothing to give them because my mother continued to be cruel, and that makes me feel so guilty.  Don‚Äôt give yourself a reason to feel bad.  Block her."
