GastricBypass,fr3eden,t3_g1vxri,1589855600.0,"I had gastric bypass 10 years ago and what really got everything moving was moving. And I mean,breaking a sweat every single day, cold weather or hot. I walked all the time. Every spare minute. 

They say it takes doing something 12 times to become an actual habit. Try walking every day for a half hour twelve times, and I guarantee you’ll see what I mean. Then, keep doing it.

4 years in, and I stopped because I moved.  The weight started coming back on.  I started up that habit again and my weight has been steady since 2014, give or take 5-10 lbs.  moving is the best thing you can do for your metabolism. Aaaaand...WATER!

I understand that obviously you end up being promoted, but to tell the person you’re involved with that you’ll be on a show to promote yourself (she wrote a book and is trying to get a cooking show going) and that the plan is that she found love and it might be a catfish.  So the man you’re really seeing has to sit back and watch you do this?  You don’t think that’s a scam? If you watch the video, you’ll see what I mean.  

It makes a mockery of everything the previous 90 day people have struggled with.  It’s just getting worse every season. Now it’s mostly made up garbage for ratings.  It was originally intended to explain how the process works, and what you go through emotionally and what not.  What she’s doing is lying to people.   Lying=scamming.  Scamming=lying.

My mother, literally all my life from childhood until I stopped speaking to her three years ago introduced me to EVERYONE and ANYONE as her “Baby”.  In my twenties, thirties, forties...it was always embarrassing.  And it was usually with her college professor colleagues or people like that.   I started to say things like (holding out my hand fro a shake) “I apologize for that.  I’m not actually a baby, my name is ...” hoping it would make her look like an idiot, and/or embarrass her.  But it never did. She wanted people to see me as her property, and beneath her.  Keep in mind, I was in banking, and rather high up.  I also am an artist, published and work on commission with my art on display in my city and in a couple galleries. I wasn’t a “nothing” like she would make me sound.  I stopped going to anything with her after a while.  Every year she would have a party at her house for her students and her colleagues and she demanded I come.  And I mean, DEMANDED.  turns out, she wanted to appear “human” having an actual daughter, who of course she got to call her “baby” to EVERYONE. I WAS 48 the last time I went to her party.  I almost felt like bringing copies of my resume so I didn’t look like a special ed adult, the way she spoke of me.  

I just had to let a lot go and carve out a good life for myself.  I try to forget it all, but it’s good to be reminded. That way I stay strong about no contact.  I hope you find peace with all this. I think you will if you stick to your souls rules."

I spent my whole life “understanding” her, while none of my needs were met.  I had to understand why she hated being a mother.  I had to understand why she was cruel.

I’ve always lived by a certain rule when it comes to sex.  If I do not want to do it, I do not do it. Sex is supposed to be fun and it’s supposed to feel good. If something feels gross to you, do not do it and let your partner know that that is a strict rule. I’m more grossed out at the thought of eating ass than I am of eating a bug.

Eventually you develop certain muscles that will support your movements, but that takes a little time. And being petite adds a bit of a challenge so your movements might feel exaggerated, and of course that feels unnatural.  I promise you though, it will feel awesome eventually! 

Another thing to note is if you lean back just slightly, it adds more pressure for him and feels better for both of you. 

Having him guide you will help the best I believe. Everything I know (in my 50’s and still a good looking, healthy chick) is because we shared good communication.

NoStupidQuestions,foyamdb,t3_ga4qtf,1588168931.0,"I usually glove up and mask up, but a couple days ago I had to get two things at the store but forgot my mask (did have gloves) so I went in and out as quickly as I could (I was one of about 4 people who didn’t have masks. I’m a woman, the other three were big tall men).  Well you would have thought I was wearing the scarlet letter!! There actually was a guy who pressed himself up against the shelving as I passed and then he loudly commented to his wife “Can’t believe she’s walking around without a MASK!!! “.    First of all, that mask is to prevent me from you if I’m not sick. And I’m not sick. So I know 5 minutes in and out isn’t going to kill YOU.  and if you’re worried about me, I thank you so, kind stranger.  No need to press your body up against food in order to protect me, though.

Some people are insane right now.  We are losing or minds and or social skills."

EstrangedAdultChild,fovev3e,t1_fov8uyk,1588100141.0,"My daughter is extremely defensive of me and she hates my mother.  She’s stuck up for me in ways I’ll never be able to.  Children learn the truth about their relatives. My son is similar, but more of a peace keeper. 

My mother damaged them both as well. Just because you’re not there to see it doesn’t mean its not happening. Keep that in mind. My parents took my kids to Washington DC when they were little (under ten) and n mother actually lost my daughter for a little while at the Abraham Lincoln statue.  My mother was high and too busy enjoying herself and lost track of my kid. My daughter could have easily been taken as it was tourist season. Just remember, your kids are little and cute, but your mom is always the same. There will be a day that they suffer because of her.  My mother screamed at my 6 year old daughter that day and she’ll never forget it. She was crying because she was scared and she was used to feeling safe with her parents.  She didn’t know what I knew at that age/. I knew it was up to me to keep up with my mother (and I have actually been taken at one point because my mom was asleep somewhere at a lake). I didn’t know that parents kept you safe.  I thought parents hated you and you better be quiet and be aware of them and their feelings and your surroundings. 

I’m saying this because your mother will eventually act out on the kids, especially when the stop being cute and start having a voice."
EstrangedAdultChild,foupf01,t1_foui8sy,1588088197.0,"That’s exactly what she wants you to do.  The most powerful way to respond is to not respond.  It’s cruel in its own way.  Do not give her what she wants.  Attention.  It will mean you care. No matter what you say, it won’t change her.  It will only give her fuel to hurt you more because she’ll defend herself.  If a stranger said those things to you, would you keep going back and forth?  No.  You’d block them.  I urge you to go silent.  Empower yourself."
EstrangedAdultChild,fouoo2e,t3_g9mw1c,1588087831.0,"Please please please just block her.  I did this three years ago and I’ve never felt more free.  She will never be anything but cruel.  It’s hard to concentrate on your family or your needs when someone is being so cruel, especially the person who’s supposed to love you and support you the most.  Nothing makes you feel lonelier. 

Don’t keep that line of communication open for her.  There’s nothing of value that she’ll ever say to you.  Nothing that will improve your life.  And she’ll never be who you need her to be.   Once you accept that, and once you stop seeing her name pop up anywhere, you will be free.  Do it for your kids if not for you.  My children are all grown, but they have memories of days on end that I had nothing to give them because my mother continued to be cruel, and that makes me feel so guilty.  Don’t give yourself a reason to feel bad.  Block her."

I can’t imagine what you go through during all this.  I don’t know if I could keep myself from walking around with a flask in my back pocket and sipping from it very often!"
