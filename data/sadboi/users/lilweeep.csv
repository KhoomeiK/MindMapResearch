SuicideWatch,fpbtq76,t3_gcb0sp,1588478483.0,"keep going. you did not come this far just to come this far. write what YOU want. your writing is the only thing you will ever fully own besides your body. keep practicing and keep pushing it out there. people want to read what you have to say, dreams can take a while to manifest sometimes. when you feel like giving up that is the time to push more. xoxo much love"
