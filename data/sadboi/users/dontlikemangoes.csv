People are condemned to patchy internet suring quarantine time: assuming you mean during, that is technically grammatically correct but sounds very awkward, and word choice could be improved. Condemned doesn't 100% fit here; it's too harsh and has more of a context of the person doing something wrong to deserve it. I would use the word ""subjected to"" or perhaps ""faced with."" This is less of an issue, but quarantine time sounds slightly bulky. I would  just use quarantine. 
Can you gie me a pointer on this subject- assuming you mean give, that is also technically grammatically correct as long as you use a question mark at the end, but not 100% clear.

If you mean task, then change subject to task, but if you're asking for information about a subject, I would use ""some information"" instead of ""a pointer.""
