depression,foigflr,t3_g76n13,1587786052.0,"That’s exactly how I feel but I was always too scared to say it. I feel so pathetic all the time and like I have no ducking reason to be depressed. Maybe if I’ve had some traumatic accident I could have a reason to be so fucked up...but I don’t. And I hate myself everyday because of it. At least knowing that I’m not alone in this is somewhat reassuring, so thank you."
