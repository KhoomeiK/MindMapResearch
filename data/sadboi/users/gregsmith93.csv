bipolar,fqwzkg4,t3_gldnr6,1589722131.0,"I‚Äôm like you OP, I‚Äôm so grateful that I have stability in my life and that I have these pills to keep me sane but I just miss having real emotions, I feel like risperidone and depakote have taken away part of my character. I wasn‚Äôt always unstable and manic when I was not on medication and I remember those days of clarity were I was able to feel emotions such as pure love for someone. However now I‚Äôm just a floating vessel waiting for the next exciting thing to happen which will most likely not excite me that much and I won‚Äôt have that much of a reaction to. Medication I feel has stripped me away of my creativity and longing to do things which make me happy. 

I‚Äôm happy I have a normal life but I miss those days where I wasn‚Äôt medicated and I was feeling fine, but those fine days eventually turn into crazy days and everything around me explodes."
