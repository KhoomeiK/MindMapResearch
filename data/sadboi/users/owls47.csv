keto,fptpbsl,t1_fpt8yef,1588895577.0,"Thanks so much!!! This is an awesome tip.

Also I think the changes in my eating are slowly happening! Tonight I had 8oz salmon and I’ve been STUFFED for hours. This is definitely new to me but it’s a change I’m so happy with."
loseit,fptg60t,t3_fyw4rz,1588890649.0,"Girl you GOT THIS! One thing that has been helpful for me is clearing the house of junk food, sugary food, and trigger foods. There are some things like milk or coffee cream that I just can’t have in the house or I’ll over consume. I’m trying out keto as in the past I’ve consumed a lot of sugar and carbs.

I’m wishing you the best :) if you ever need someone to talk to DM me"

keto,fppd71l,t3_gehapa,1588800146.0,"I’ve just started out and the past few days have been keto but I’m eating about 1600-2000 calories which is a lot and maintaining my weight. I’m eating eggs, salmon, avocado, and nuts minimally. How did you guys cut down on the amount of food you were eating?

I’m 5’5” BMI 30+ 26F

Also what do you recommend adding to my coffee? I feel like too much half and half is not great. I add caramel premier protein protein shake but those are pretty expensive. 

Also how do you cut down on nighttime eating! I feel like I tend to overeat a lot at night.

Thanks in advance!"

BipolarReddit,fnqnqof,t1_fnqnb14,1587168320.0,I definitely struggle with my weight due to eating when depressed not necessarily because of the medications I’m on. I want to start keto but it’s definitely been a struggle. Someone I know with schizoaffective disorder on a med that causes severe weight gain lost 30+ pounds on keto.
BipolarReddit,fnqmaoi,t3_g3dejs,1587167478.0,Hello! You could look into starting topamax or anti obesity medications. Topamax may cause neurocognitive side effects (they call it dopamax) and hair loss. Metformin may help as well. Keto is also a good option albeit hard to stick to! I’m sorry you’ve gained this weight I know how hard it can be to experience that firsthand.

medicalschool,fl86y1i,t3_fms8by,1584917162.0,It takes a lot of courage and self awareness to step away from a path you recognize is not what you truly wanted. I also wanted to add that I had to take time away from school and in that time close to no one reached out to me. I think people are very self focused in general but it perhaps doesn’t mean that they don’t care for you. Maybe they just didn’t have the space at that point in their lives to show compassion. Just something I think about sometimes.
medicalschool,fl86ncr,t1_fl7rlc5,1584916983.0,Congrats on getting a position!!! I can relate to the disappointment I also had to SOAP but I was fortunate to be happy with the location. Good luck to you!
