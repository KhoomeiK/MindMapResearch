It’s that they don’t want to understand. They want to put you in a box. My mom always says misery loves company. They want you to be as miserable as they are. 
Hooking up with someone just because won’t make it easier. Having an emotional connection with another person is a beautiful thing. There is no rush when it comes to relationships.

I completely understand that a lot of people are using this service because of COVID-19. I, also understand that people are still continuing to panic purchase food and other goods. My issue is that there are a lot of people who have breathing issues such as emphysema, bronchitis, asthma etc. and they are forced to leave their homes to go into the stores to purchase the food. Thereby making them susceptible to contracting the virus. Last week I had to head to my local Whole Foods because I could not schedule a single delivery. That is the only headache that I’m dealing with. I do have food so, we are not shit out of luck, but I feel sorry for the people who are running low on supplies and are afraid to leave their homes. 

FYI: the system has always had that issue with items being “sold out”. I know someone who works at the Whole Foods Market and they told me that a lot of times when the prime shoppers are unable to locate an item they just say that it is sold out. That was not a problem previously, but with what’s going on in the world it’s a huge problem now that needs to be fixed.￼"

However, the child has blond hair , blue eyes and pale skin. He is white with a biracial father.

TrueOffMyChest,fi9ayu3,t3_f6w1d5,1582260157.0,"Race was not talked about to and around you because it is not an issue that you or members of your family have to (had to) deal with. People will not look at you and assume that you are stupid, poor, lazy and ignorant because of the color of your skin. Racism and prejudice are taught. No one is born feeling this way. We don’t even realize it , but the media plays a crucial role in race relations within our society. They play upon old stereotypes and freshen them for the present day. 

I’ve read through each and every comment in this thread. The one thing I have to say is that Black Americans or Afro Americans are not a monolith. People believe that the rest of the African diaspora are superior to Black Americans because of the negative portrayals in the media.  Images so engrained within our minds that it’s hard to look past them. This can apply to all if you think about it.

As far as the stereotype about black people not tipping, I’ve heard that before. However, where I live on the East Coast I have seen plenty of people in general leave restaurants and not tip their waiters or leave pennies for them. Keep in mind there are a lot of people who were not taught to tip waiters, waitresses, cab drivers , delivery drivers...etc. That knowledge is class based. You can not fault children and teenagers for poking fun at something that they do not understand. Something that is new to them. It is better to attempt to educate them rather than write off an entire ethnicity or race. 

The reason why trans women of color particularly black trans women are dying is because of fear. Fear coming from men who hate themselves for desiring trans women in general. Those who were taught that being LGBTQIAP was wrong and filthy. So, for you to say “now you see why” is appalling. Not to mention your myopic view of hip hop culture and black culture in general is sad. The fact that you are an educator of students of color specifically black students is not surprising to me.  You hold the futures of these students in your hands. You determine whether or not these children continue their education or in some cases fall into a life of crime.


If you truly want to change then educate yourself,  leave your small community and travel to other places. Only then can you truly change. 

FYI: Research where that so-called “ghetto culture” sprouted from. Learn how systematic racism plays a role in it."
