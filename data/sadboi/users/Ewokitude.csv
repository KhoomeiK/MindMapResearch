politics,fr5daaf,t1_fr54o67,1589906661.0,"I'm a member of the American Statistical Association and they surveyed the members a few years ago about data falsification/misrepresentation. While I'm having trouble finding the report they released, iirc around 2/3 statisticians have been asked by management at least one point in their career to deliberately misrepresent data to be more flattering and 1/4 have been asked to deliberately falsify data for the same purpose.

Ethics is absolutely a must have in any career working with data and it really should be a matter of common sense as well. When you're working on something that could potentially cost lives, whether it's on a study of the effectiveness of a new drug/treatment, measuring the failure rate of a part in a new automobile or plane, or something else, misrepresenting the data might make management happy, but pretending a flaw isn't there does not mean the flaw doesn't exist and that can be a costly mistake, both financially and in human lives. 

Unfortunately this is the exact mistake Republican ""leadership"" around the country is making. They think that if they don't look at the coronavirus statistics that the virus doesn't exist. Tragically for the victims of their malfeasance, coronavirus does not care about their lack of data and will continue spreading regardless."

The ruins of Sector 7 are incredibly inconsistent too. First you see the whole plate drop, then moments later you're running back into the slums and there are a bunch of makeshift buildings still standing, then during the wall climb there is literal mountains of rubble, then in the Shinra tower you see the whole area is on fire (when there were no fires earlier). Also in the Shinra tower there is a point where you can see the Sector 6 plate through two different windows on the opposite side of the building on the same floor. 

There are tons of environmental errors in this game. Most will go unnoticed and don't affect the game much at all, but I definitely wouldn't read into inconsistencies like these. The game had a long development cycle and it's not uncommon in games to have different art assets for the same thing to meet different needs (especially with large art teams where multiple people will be working on them). It's also not terribly uncommon for one version of an art asset to be updated slightly later in development and the others aren't.

When you think about it, in its most basic form, a hot air balloon isn't much more than hot air producing lift. China had gunpowder and sky lanterns so it's not unreasonable someone among the educated class would create an airship. 

Also if your world has floating islands, perhaps there is something unique about gravity on your planet or there is some magical form of lift that levitates them (perhaps a mineral in the islands?). If you can get huge chunks of rock to float without issue, then the people in your world should be able to levitate a wooden ship.

My medieval world has many things that would be technological plot holes in the real world but make sense as natural consequences of magic. In my case, magic is exclusively available to nobility, academics, and skilled guild workers (though anyone can learn it). Nobility might be taught magic as part of their upbringing while the academics more rigorously study it and become the mages/wizards. Meanwhile I have set up many different guilds in which guild members know only one type of magic that benefits their trade. For instance the Navigator's Guild, which consists of sailors who know wind magic, is hired to create favorable winds for trade ships. Other guilds might use ice magic to create ice for refrigeration or fire magic to temper different metals and alloys. Why not have a guild that produces airships? :D"

I think a big problem with it was all the PHS puzzles, if it was just an environment we took a detour through to get to the top of the tower then I think it would work really well with the original since you'd get exposure to the horrors of some of the Shinra experiments but your objective was still getting to the top. Instead, half the time I was in the Drum I was so busy trying to figure *where* to go I completely forgot *what* I was even there for.

Also is it ever explained why it's so damaged? Sephiroth only cut the bridge and when you wake up on the bottom there's debris and damaged machinery everywhere. Again if we followed more closely with the original, breaking out of Aerith's room and making a detour through the Drum, then I could understand the damage given the path of destruction left in the original. But here it's really unclear."
FFVIIRemake,fo5qk75,t1_fo4lc5m,1587532641.0,"The reason Sephiroth is so well known is because he was such a good villain in the original. It was a slow burn. Throughout the Midgar section you hear about him. He was a SOLDIER, the absolute best, Cloud looked up to him, he had a reputation that carried weight. You start to admire him because the characters in the world did. I remember wondering ""wow I wonder if Cloud is as good as Sephiroth?""

Then you get to the Shinra building and see the massacre there and it's so completely tonally different from what came earlier it's shocking and leaves you uneasy. *What* could do that?! Was it Jenova? There's trails of blood everywhere and when you get to the upper floor you see President Shinra dead, impaled by a sword...someone beat you to him. It was Sephiroth! ""Only Sephiroth could use that sword."" Again, implying Sephiroth is unmatched in skill. The dialogue says he was trying to stop Shinra from reaching the Promised Land, Barret even asks if they're on the same side. Cloud says no, but even at this point it was clear there wasn't something quite right with Cloud so I wasn't sure I believed him.

When I first played this game 22 years ago, I left Midgar thinking we were going to find Sephiroth. He was going to be the next party member. How cool would it be to have the best of SOLDIER join and help us stop Shinra! How small I still thought the stakes were that Shinra was the biggest threat. I thought even if Sephiroth disagrees with Cloud on things, maybe we'd bring him to our side. Hell, Cloud and Barret disagreed plenty already. 

Then Kalm happened...the flashback. Nope! There's no way Sephiroth is joining us. He's evil and irredeemable after that. He clearly has his own objectives and he'll crush anything that gets in his way. Suddenly Shinra didn't seem like quite so pressing a threat and maybe now we better focus on tracking him down and stopping him.

When I think back to that it was so effective. Some people say he was underdeveloped as a villain, but a lot of his development happens from the perspective of others or as a result of his actions that happen off-screen. It works. Your mind fills in the gaps and you're left wondering what he's capable of. The Midgar Zolom that wipes you early on? He impales it on a tree. Do you even have a chance against him? He's scary because you know his reputation and you've seen what he can do in Nibelheim and the Shinra HQ and to the Midgar Zolom. 

When I think to what they did in the Remake, shoving him in right away and making him just some generic evil bad guy from the flashes you get, I can't help but agree with OP. They went with the media representation of Sephiroth rather than actually look at his character in the original."
FFVIIRemake,fo5ngg2,t1_fo4t55v,1587530131.0,Coolest thing for me is Ifrit used Hellfire literally the moment ~~Hundred Gunner~~ Arsenal fired off its ultimate attack Cry Havoc and it literally looked like Ifrit charged in front of the party to block the blast and then bitch slapped the boss with an attack of his own. The columns of fire on the side just added tons to the effect.

AnimalCrossing,fo49v3y,t1_fo48jkp,1587500678.0,Was just going to say they need to add bananas back now
FFVIIRemake,fo3thjo,t1_fo3l9o8,1587492677.0,Yeah you're right. I'll fix that. It seems each character has 4 returning weapons and 2 new ones except for Tifa who has 3 new and 3 returning.

Soonâ„¢"
FFVIIRemake,fo34f7j,t1_fo2xneu,1587480350.0,I noticed the weapon menu has 7 slots for weapons in the UI but there are only 6 weapons so I have wondered if they'll do a .5 upgrade like they've done with Kingdom Hearts
NintendoSwitch,fo2zu11,t1_fo2udhd,1587477777.0,Might have been intended to come out on Earth Day but corona delayed it slightly
AnimalCrossing,fo2znb1,t1_fo2xcap,1587477664.0,I'd love a greenhouse/garden shop to put next to my orchard
FFVIIRemake,fo1xmu9,t1_fo1wljq,1587443959.0,I was amazed when I discovered it a couple years ago and went down the rabbit hole of reading about FF7's development and how concepts that were cut got put into FF8 and Parasite Eve
AnimalCrossing,fo1wvlg,t1_fo1lqa9,1587443399.0,If you pause in the first second or so of the video you can see the museum area takes up almost a full quarter of the island. It looks great but I really wish islands were larger so I could do more stuff like this
FFVIIRemake,fo1watu,t1_fo1uqi2,1587442976.0,"I'd be surprised because I'm pretty sure they cut the Cult of Jenova when they made Jenova into an alien. Originally ""Jenova"" was more like a genetic enlightenment that was latent in people and the cult was trying to unlock. Most of the early FF7 storyline actually got recycled into Parasite Eve which has a similar concept with mitochondria"
rpg_gamers,fo1sj5j,t1_fo1ocbt,1587440498.0,People are forgetting most of the original Midgar was just as linear. They really didn't do anything different but lengthen a lot of the pre-existing paths to give the city more scale
movies,fo1lpyd,t1_fo1gzh6,1587436050.0,"While karmic justice might seem to feel good, the reality of the situation is this would put an increasing strain on an already overtaxed medical system. No one wins. People will die, not just them and their families but also the doctors and nurses that treat them or other essential workers that might interact with them. It is not good, it is terribly sad how unnecessary that is."
FFVIIRemake,fo17fk8,t1_fo16sbu,1587427287.0,Iirc that's also why she has a shell motif in her design to connect her to the City of the Ancients. She was supposed to be the leader of a Cult of Jenova
FFVIIRemake,fo0s9gm,t1_fo06g95,1587418816.0,I don't feel free. I feel trapped by whatever convoluted storyline they're going to tack onto part 2. They were absolutely unnecessary and soured an otherwise flawless game
FFVIIRemake,fo0nqnf,t3_g4yapt,1587416431.0,Edea was originally supposed to be in Final Fantasy VII and I think some of that translated into the music. Just the opening for her [boss theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxW13qBTO1U) includes parts of the main theme of FF7
