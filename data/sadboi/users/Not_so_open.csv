You can never be good enough if you keep comparing yourself with others so just shut down the world around you. For a while, ignore about what people think of you. Take a moment to figure out why all your efforts are going in vain. Is it because you aren’t trying hard enough or is it because you haven’t yet found the way to present your skills and impress the interviewer. Try working on it, build an effective resume with interesting skills and hobbies. Don’t lose hope. Keep trying, it might take a while but you will eventually land up in a job. Good luck!"

depression,f8vo4es,t3_e2gnrw,1574873789.0,When in pain I stay in bed and watch some series till my eyes fall off. I go 2-3 days without sleep. I know it’s unhealthy but binge watching lets me escape reality and go numb. I couldn’t find any better way to stave off my depression.

I don’t understand how people are so sure about what they want. Do they not get bored or be distracted by something more interesting than what they do. As for me, I get part of the way through something and find reasons to quit."
