I know that feel of watching a positive show but then having to go back to your regular life and you feel low/negative again. It's def a struggle. 

I'm glad your therapist gave you some homework to do about 10 things you like about yourself. I know you're having a hard time coming up with the 10 things and that's okay. Don't force yourself. It's okay to step away and come back to it later. I think you will greatly benefit from your homework once you come up with your list."

The main difference between BPD and bipolar disorder is the cyclical moods. For folx like me with BPD, our emotional dysregulation can last from a few hours to a few days and we bounce back pretty quick, while on the other hand folks with bipolar disorder have extended periods of extremely low moods (Depression) and high moods (mania or hypomania). 

Another main difference between BPD and bipolar disorder is self-image. Folx with bipolar disorder, during a manic episode, tend to have a grandiose self-image while folx with BPD have an unstable self-image and/or typically view themselves negatively."

First, I’ll just offer you some validation for your situation. It sounds really rough and honestly if I was in your situation I would feel pretty triggered myself. 

Second, I know that we are all supposed to be sheltering in place so it may feel like you have nowhere to go. However you can still go outside. I suggest that when you are feeling overwhelmed to go take a walk if you can or do rigorous exercise in your room for 10 mins. Any type of movement especially cardio will give you some endorphins to help distract you and also calm you down a bit. Take a hot or cold shower depending on the weather LOL. Listen to your favorite music, something that’s upbeat. these are all suggestions to help bring you back to an emotional baseline to keep your distress in check and tide you over until you go to therapy. (I’m not a mental health professional, so don’t take what I say as a prescription.) 

Finally, When your mom is triggering you I highly suggest leaving the room and doing the aforementioned activities. I hope this helps"

My parents at first were defensive but, with time and distance, they have become better supporters with my mental health.

Idk how old you are or if you are able to move out (also prob not a good time to do so right now, haha) but if you are able to move out. Do so. Honestly, distance (and therapy) helped repair my relationship with my parents. 

Do you have support at home from other family members at home? Support from friends? Do you have paid support from a therapist? I want to make sure you have another support person in your life because you mentioned that you struggled with Depression for years."

>I argued subjective indifference and judgment. This is not even comparable to the Jogger who in fact needs to be championed. Disobedience and causing harm to civilians is out right Tom foolery. When you're Black how do you not know the game is not set in your favour to push the envelope?

I agree with you. I am not condoning Reed's behavior, it was reckless and irresponsible; however, it is unfair for us to compare his life as ""worthy of death"" / lesser than Arbery's (the jogger). Is Trayvon Martin's life worth less than Arbery's because Martin ""looked like"" he had a gun? Is Philando Castille's life worth less than Arbery's because he made the cop aware that he had a gun? Ask yourself these questions.

&#x200B;

>This is a case of delinquency. He has an adverse effect to the black community. Check the receipts on this dude. Why would you mourn that.

White folx can be in the same situation and have the same rap sheet as Reed but you'd find them in a prison cell, not a casket. (And sometimes they even still walk free!) There are literally videos of white people punching cops but not once is a gun, a lethal weapon, pulled on them. I mourn Reed just as much as I am mourning Arbery because a LIFE was LOST. Full stop. Somebody lost a son, a brother, a cousin, a friend--that's something worth mourning.

Did you mourn for Michael Jackson when he died despite, possibly, knowing that he molested children? (Watch Finding Neverland if you didn't know this.)  We are quick to mourn Black celebs and deny any wrongdoing they may have committed over our own regular black citizens.

>Why do we have to be the race that martyrs digenerates simply because they are part of the racist dichotomy of law enforcement. This does not strengthen your cause. It actually weakens it because it promotes blind loyalty. This is how Black Lives Matter became a bust.

I agree with you in that standing up for folks who have disobeyed the law deliberately does not strengthen our fight for equity and justice; however, to completely exclude any Black person from the BLM movement based on gender, sexuality, income, education, and background is reinforcing Black respectability politics and the white gaze, further dividing us.

I'm not saying that we should ""uplift Reed and make him the face of BLM conversation"", what I'm saying is that his life is just as important as Arbery's, as Martin's,  as Castille's, etc. Also, BLM did not a bust. It's still alive and thriving.

>As for white people abusing power. You and I already know white privilege is the reason why. Its unfair and that is how it is so long as Whites are the majority. You will see this dynamic change decades later when minorities gain more positions of power within the judicial system.

I'm glad we agree on this. I hope more black folks get into positions of power in the judicial system and government.

I'd suggest you read more about Black respectability politics because it is alive and thriving in our community. Here are some places to start:

[Article](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-rise-of-respectability-politics) | [Gatekeeping and Remaking: The Politics of Respectability in African American Women's History and Black Feminism](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/43088/pdf) | [Performing a Vanilla Self: Respectability Politics, Social Class, and the Digital World](https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/23/3/163/4962541)"

BlackMentalHealth,fpsx0bq,t1_fpsrmz8,1588881045.0,"I've said most of what I wanted to say in my reply to DeepReturn above.

I refuse to adopt an indifferent attitude no matter what any Black person does. 

White people are antagonizing cops now protesting the stay-at-home orders and you have yet to see 1 cop pull a gun on them or 1 person kill them for DISOBEYING the stay-at-home orders. 

I'm still going to mourn the loss of a Black life no matter the situation because we, as Black folx in America, are disproportionately affected systemically."
BlackMentalHealth,fpsvl3w,t1_fpsod0w,1588880358.0,"Yeah I've read the articles but I haven't seen the Facebook Live video. 

But also, this begs the question: is Sean Reed's death more ""justified"" because he shot back at the police?

Viewing Reed's death as more justified than Ahmaud Arbery's is placing a heirarchy on which ""type of Black person"" deserves to die or not. 

This is the same logic of when Bill Cosby said ""Black men pull up your pants and the cops won't kill you."" This is a product of Black respectability politics from the Civil Rights era(?). (It could extend further than that but that's when the term came about, I believe.) 

Unless you're a Black celebrity that white folx seem ""acceptable"" or one they can ""get behind"", you're just another ""dangerous"", Black body no matter what you do.

You can be jogging and get killed. (Ahmaud Arbery)
You can be walking home with Skittles in your pocket and get killed (Trayvon Martin)
You can can literally be following the cops orders and be gunned down right in from of a loved one (Philando Castille).

It's not fair of us to rank Black folks lives based on laws that are created and changed by the whim of predominantly white male lawmakers. (Laws are not synonymous with morals.)"

BlackMentalHealth,fpag4a1,t3_gc8s8q,1588447457.0,"TW: mentions suicide 

My success this week was not making a suicide attempt after a negative life event. 

I mentioned in our Weekly MH thread that I had a horrible experience with my therapist recently that made me lose my trust with her. Since I felt so uncomfortable I was unable to communicate openly with her about my life which would not serve me well in the long run. I ended things with my therapist. Typically when this type of stuff happens I spiral so deep into a depression that I try to KMS but this time I did not attempt. 🎉instead I fell into a deep Depression, with suicidal ideation, but I reached out for help.

On a different note, I registered to take a psychology class at the community college near me. It's online, ofc, but I'm happy that I am going back to school for a bit."

depression,fp2ffge,t1_fp1stx3,1588260833.0,"Yea I was chronically suicidal before taking Wellbutrin XL. While on it, I will attempt less to never. When I went off it, I was attempting like once a week."
depression,fp11hng,t3_gajy3p,1588221905.0,I'm on Wellbutrin XL 150mg. Apparently that's the lowest(?) Dose. I went cold turkey on it and I was suicidal everyday and made numerous attempts. (due note that I had some external stressors going on) not sure how it will affect you.

BlackMentalHealth,fozi1tw,t1_fowlwzw,1588191007.0,Breakups are difficult. It's totally valid what you're feeling right now and I'm glad you have tried positive activities to help you feel better (i.e. excercising and journaling). I'm not in a great place myself so I don't have much to offer. All I can say is that I hope you're being gentle with yourself during this time you're dealing with a lot.
BlackMentalHealth,fozhrpq,t3_g95fxd,1588190872.0,"It looks like I am going to have to find another therapist, yet again. My last therapist dumped me back in Dec 2019. I got with this new therapist in about March. Now I have to find another because she called me ""condescending"" and I don't trust that will not judge my words and experiences anymore. 😔

I hate that I have to find a new therapist during a f**king pandemic."
depression,fov8w62,t1_fou11vi,1588097302.0,"My definition of chronically suicidal: I don't want to die but I think about death a lot (like 70% of the time). My suicidal ideation can become overwhelming when a negative event occurs that causes me to become emotionally overwhelmed. When I am emotionally overwhelmed that is when my suicidal thoughts take over my mind (100%) and it's difficult to see the light unless I attempt. 

(My apologies in advance if that's too detailed.) 

Yes! There is medication that can help folks with mental illness; however there is no pill that ""cures"" suicidal ideation. Right now, the meds that are available for folks with any mental illness are the same meds they have been using since like...the 19th-20th century, just slightly modified and rebranded. (Just stating an interesting fact. I'm not negating the use of meds because they work for a good handful of folks.) 

Anyway, I suggest that you watch the documentary Bedlam on PBS. It's free to watch online. It talks about the American mental health system and it's very eye-opening. (Note: the doc does not have too many stories from people like us with lived experiences but it's nonetheless informative about the current system at large.)"
depression,fosjao3,t3_g99heb,1588031814.0,"You just described what it's like being chronically suicidal but with one major caveat. 

I'm chronically suicidal (I have BPD and Depression). I have these thoughts all the time. I always think about dying but not wanting to die; however there are times when I'm so deep in my suicidal episode that I attempt. I've attempted at least 5+ times (I lost count after 5) and I'm still here. (Honestly, I'm not sure why I'm still here. Maybe to tell you this! Lol.) 

It sucks. Life is horrible and draining but like some of the other commenters said, ""you still got fight left in you."" I really hope the best for you, I hope you get the help you seek (if you are seeking), and I hope you don't attempt at your life (don't follow my example). 

It sucks(?) that you don't have a mental illness to attach it to but also it's good that you don't. Cherish that, for real. Having a mental illness is a b***h."
