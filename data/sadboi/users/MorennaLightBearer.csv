recruitinghell,fmf4n84,t3_fupliy,1586019843.0,"Well, your options depend entirely on one thing: money. Many people will recommend learning a ""medical skill"" or entering the medical field in one way or another. Those jobs require an education and an education costs money. With no money, you could take out a loan but you still need credit - real credit, not ""I'm on my mommy's card"" credit (like me lmao). And even with that aside -  can you afford to take the time to go to school?

If you have the finances, I say go all the way. Go back to school and learn a hard skill. Like they said, the medical field is an excellent choice. One guy said ""become a PA"" for a long term option as if that's fucking easy. You have to go to graduate school for that and if you got the chops (and the money) to become a PA, just do ANYTHING you want. The virus will have passed by the time you're out of school and now you've boxed yourself in (and spent hella money doing it). There are a good bit of stable jobs aside from the medical field. Even so, the medical field is BROAD. You don't have to jump into a stereotypical hospital role.

If you don't, that means taking what you can get and just building experience in the job force. If you're willing to take the risk - some places are hiring LOADS of people. Primarily, grocery stores and delivery services. If you have a car, start delivering food. A lot of people want contactless delivery so you don't even have to look at these people when you go to their houses. You can do this to make money while have the time to think about what you want to do long term. 

Or you can get a job through sheer dumb luck. My company is still hiring. I had no experience in much of anything when I got hired and no connections. I make around $17/hr now. You can DM me if you're interested. Idk what state you live in, we're only in a handful."

So fuck you. Most women go to work every morning and leave every afternoon like their male counterparts. That shit happens far more than people think it does."

He'll text me asking to meet up and fuck and say a bunch of sexual shit when we never even kissed when we were together let alone had sex. Idk why he seems to think I'm suddenly dtf when I wouldn't touch him when we were dating (it's complicated). 

But he's usually sober when he does stupid shit."

2. It's not like men were doing women a favor, if women weren't hunting, they were serving their part in another capacity.
3. Why would any species allow on a large scale for it's opposite sex counterpart to just die off? That's how your species goes extinct. Male and females in most species are fundamental for that species' survival. 
4. Technological advancements in the prehistoric era very likely had contributors from both sexes. 

Cavemen weren't goddamn starfish and protected women because they were just nice like that.

You don't get special, magic points for doing the BARE BIOLOGICAL MINIMUM. It's the same reason you don't get points for being ""nice."" Being decent is barest of minimums."

Also, for private jobs (aka not the government), 6 months is a long time. For what you're qualified for I'd say 1 week - 2 months for them to call you back. It could be longer, smaller businesses and minimum wage move faster than large corporations and schools/organizations. If you hear nothing after a month, reach out to them but don't reapply. 

For state or federal jobs, be prepared to wait. 1 month to 6 months. Could be longer, could be never. 

In general, don't stop applying until you have the first paycheck in hand. Even when you get a start date, it can change. Right now, you need experience. Build it and work your way up by applying to new places. Try six months of work before trying to go to school simultaneously. Get used to working full-time and see if you can truly handle both (or can afford both). You've never worked so try to acclimate to doing so."
jobs,ffhygvj,t3_etnpnx,1579959275.0,"Fast food is a dead end. You could try working your way through retail or find a job at a warehouse. If you're looking for a sure fire job, nursing is a smart choice. Unlike literally every other option outside of medical, dentist, or pharmacy school - becoming an RN will get you a job. A damn good paying job at that. You could also try community college or technical school. I recommend the latter.

If you're crap at school or really don't wanna spend money, you're gonna have to just keep applying until something sticks. In the meantime, you aren't working so try volunteering. Also, trainee positions are great for people with no experience and few hard skills. 

College is a waste unless you pick a degree worth a damn and do well. Trust me, I have one and my ass is unemployed. I can't even get a minimum wage job, that's how worthless it is."

jobs,ffhxlqg,t3_etfmot,1579958325.0,"I've had a horrible female boss who was so determined to be rid of me, she jumped to fire me because she thought I was sleeping during a meeting. I was looking at an ant on the desk for all of three seconds. She didn't care when I explained and fired me the next day.  While I was there, she gave me a warning for everything - for not smiling, for not telling her good morning when I arrived once (she was literally on the phone), for not asking enough questions, for asking too many questions, for not knowing the brand new employee benefits policies (I was there for 3 days at that point and the booklet was literally a hundred pages - not even the employee benefits specialist knew the answer), and on and on. I was even berated for saying rude customers didn't bother me. 

I had a female boss who was fucking AMAZING. She preferred positive encouragement but would tell you if you weren't doing something well. She was kind but firm and very fair. She was just a gem of a human. I learned a lot from her and honestly, she was the best boss I ever had. I've had far more good female bosses/supervisors than poor ones.

Honestly, women are people. I find when female bosses are bad, they're horrible. Especially, to other women. Shitty male bosses are easier to handle (as a woman) in my opinion. I don't really like all female or majority female workplaces if (as horrible as it sounds) they're mostly white. As a black woman, it's just harder to navigate and unless, I make myself the leader in the dominant social group, I'm at the bottom of the totom pole. Lowkey, white girls scare me if I'm being honest lmao. Specifically of the Southern suburban Christain variety. Terrifying. Seriously."
jobs,ffhw1y0,t3_etny42,1579956499.0,"I'm in the same boat - sort of. I graduated last August, I just turned 21 this month. When I first started applying for jobs, for every 3 applications, I was getting at least one interview. I didn't even apply to many jobs. Maybe 20, got 6 offers. Dazzled everyone by being a 20 yr old graduate - my grades were shit but most employers seemed to be easily impressed. One or two from my town knew who I was since I was my hs' val and young at the time. So that halo carried over. Ended up taking a job at the same company my mother worked, great paying corporate position. Got fired in a week (Oct '19). I hated my former boss for (what I felt at the time) ruining my life over an assumption. I have almost no job experience and a useless degree in English. I got a seasonal job for two months but in my parents' opinion, I've been unemployed for five months now.

I just keep applying. I apply to a minimum of 10 - 15 jobs a day since the day I lost that job. I don't get a single phone call or interview (aside from during the holiday season) but I keep trying. I've been rejected from retail, grocery stores, convenience stores, fast food, warehouses, admin/offices, several cities, school boards, states, and the feds. Businesses small and large. Countless internships. I have no friends, hobbies, or talents. But I don't stop. My only blessing is that I have zero responsibilities or bills. My day consists of applying for jobs, reading, and studying (I'm enrolled in a post bacc program through my uni online). 

I have no motivation for anything but getting a decent job. There is nothing special that pushes me forward. I just want to achieve the bare minimum an adult should achieve. I keep applying because unless I win the lottery or my parents drop dead tomorrow, I'm not gonna be a millionaire and not have to work."

It was obvious she never cleaned. I ended up spending hours cleaning since I had planned to leave the apartment two days after she did. 

We were the first people to stay in those brand new apartments too so the place was spotless when we moved in. We were only there a year. I hate people who don't clean after themselves. It's one thing if you live alone, it's another when you obviously share a space.

Screw this girl, if she wanted her place clean she should have hired a maid or did it herself."
