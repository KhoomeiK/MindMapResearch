BPD,fhqmlfj,t3_f4g4q8,1581806760.0,"I was rejected from grad school and it took nearly two years before I reapplied because I was so devastated. I’m nearly done now though. I had the same thought about wanting to be married with kids by the time I was 30, and that didn’t pan out either. Here I am thinking all men are pigs because the only guys that talk to me are looking for extramarital affairs. I’m not going to say everything happens for a reason, but I will say don’t let this setback pull you down. You can be stronger than that."

BPD,ffstcnx,t3_ev0fg3,1580191726.0,I found out today that a friend of mine died as well (it’s very likely he has been dead for a couple of days now and was just found today). If you’re still sober I applaud you because I couldn’t stay that way. I’m so sorry for your loss because I am mourning mine. Sending you love.
BPD,fffaij6,t1_ffasdoo,1579879677.0,"I literally learned everything about them from how to care for them to breeding. I now own four, and I’ve lost interest in them. I feed them and keep them healthy, but I feel so guilty because I don’t play with them anymore. They can live up to thirty years, so I have these creatures, and I would feel bad about rehoming them because I initially signed up for the responsibility."

BPD,fetpf44,t1_feszv8r,1579377988.0,When I mentioned that I felt I may have BPD to my psychiatrist she agreed with me and also said she’d never made an official diagnosis on my chart for this very reason.

BPD,fen9nt6,t1_fen8hsl,1579279990.0,"I appreciate your feedback. I don’t know why it kind of hit me suddenly, but I felt so lost. I didn’t know who I was anymore, and I was scared because I’ve been put on antidepressants before and I didn’t feel like me, but who am I really? I was talking with my ex and he is really proud of me for taking steps to become healthy. He told me that no matter what I will always be myself, just a healthier version of myself."
BPD,fen7w6i,t1_fen7fpv,1579278908.0,"I guess I should explain what I mean by social justice. I get so angry when I see others get treated poorly due to race, religion, sexuality, etc. I also get really upset when healthcare providers treat some poorly based on history such as IV drug use. I feel like I want to be a champion for the people who cannot fight for themselves."
BPD,fen7h90,t1_fen6uia,1579278651.0,"Well I personally have never hurt someone physically or sexually. Like I said earlier, I’ve said things that I’ve regretted, but I don’t think it was ever so bad that others were unable to forgive me. I’ve even maintained healthy friendships with my exes. Just because that’s all you’ve experienced doesn’t mean that’s everyone’s experience."
BPD,fen5v4b,t1_fen4htp,1579277648.0,"You’re entitled to your opinion, however, everyone exhibits different symptoms, and not everyone is violent. The only time my BPD is a huge issue is when I’m in a relationship, and that has a lot to do with the fact I had horrible role models as parents. I have tried very hard to maintain normalcy within my life, and I won’t say I haven’t been cruel to people, but I’ve maintained some friendships for upwards of 19-20 years. Lumping everyone together as monsters is part of the stigma."
BPD,fen4wg1,t1_fen4cm7,1579277035.0,"Everyone thinks I’m being overly dramatic, but cysts rupturing really hurts! Gotta love the cystic acne that comes along with PCOS. I get boils everywhere, and I’m a germaphobe/ super clean human."
BPD,fen3o46,t1_fen2ec9,1579276259.0,"Even before my BPD diagnosis, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, and no one took my abdominal pain seriously. I even went through CBT to prove it wasn’t just my anxiety causing my pain. Turns out I have something called polycystic ovarian syndrome, but it literally took three years of constant begging to be taken seriously. Now I’m on medication, and guess what? I’m finally pain free. I wish I could have saved some money by having fewer ER and physician visits."
BPD,femurg1,t3_epxlh6,1579270147.0,"My brain does immediately go there. I sometimes think if I self harm that I’ll be hurting others around me, and it gives me some sick satisfaction to think that they’ll suffer too. I have not self harmed, but it is something I think about."
BPD,fekmaoh,t3_epnpfz,1579203008.0,"It depends on how you are using your friends for support. I personally felt like joining this community has helped me cope with how I’m feeling and the experiences that I’ve had, but I also seek out positive posts because I want to succeed in my relationships and my journey throughout life. My therapist had similar thoughts about interacting with others that have BPD. She was concerned about me getting sucked into the black hole of unhealthy emotions and behaviors that may arise from others with the disorder. Group therapy has the benefit of being in a controlled environment where the conversations can be redirected."
BPD,fec2g1p,t3_eo7v0w,1578965685.0,"So I’m 31f and I was very recently diagnosed with BPD. I work in the medical field, and I feel extremely guilty about calling off. If I’m ill I shouldn’t be around patients, so I shouldn’t feel that much guilt, but I feel so guilty just the same. I am extremely attached to my coworkers (they’re like my adopted family) and calling off really screws up the patient assignments. I’ve never really had any negative feedback from my supervisors, and I understand the feeling of letting them down. I feel like I try to go above and beyond to make sure I stay in their good graces. There’ve been days where I called off because I felt like death, then started feeling better throughout the day and thought to myself that I could have sucked it up and gone into work. Then all the anxiety makes me feel more ill later. It’s a vicious cycle."

BPD,fd6hul4,t3_ek5pk8,1578191256.0,"I’m in the same boat. I work full time and I also go to school full time. I’m meeting with my therapist on Monday to discuss DBT options. I would talk to your therapist about your concerns and see if they have any suggestions about how to proceed. On one hand you do want to be healthy because that will ultimately increase your satisfaction in the long run, but I understand pursuing a career and how difficult it can be to put that on hold. I’m 31 and had always put my career first, so my relationships have suffered as a result. I don’t know if this helps. Good luck to you."

BPDmemes,fcr9d3j,t1_fcj5nz3,1577898661.0,I have memories from age two on. I remember that time my cousin molested me. I remember my dad beating the shit out of my mom and hitting me in the head with the butt of a gun (I was three). I remember watching the water rise and flood the only home I’d ever known. I don’t really remember people outside of my family though. My mom is always surprised when I don’t remember someone from my childhood. I wish I didn’t remember a lot of that stuff.
BPD,fcqzk32,t1_fcph46e,1577894557.0,"Once I thought I might actually do it. I called the suicide hotline and they told me to go to the hospital, but I said it was complicated because I work there."

BPD,fcpfqto,t3_ei3rkd,1577862003.0,"The only person who was able to see through the cracks was my ex. He saw the absolute worst side of me, and I hate it because I still love him so much. I hate myself for turning into an evil monster in front of him. I work in the medical field and interact with people all day long. My social wick is usually burned out by the time I come home. I am working on my Master’s degree though, so I’m relatively high functioning."
BPD,fckfbbk,t1_fckdlm4,1577724050.0,"I agree. It also sounds like she has some unresolved issues with BPD that she is going to have to deal with, but you should open up that dialogue about how she makes you feel when she says things like that."

I’m not sure if it helps me or hinders me that he’s such an understanding person and checks on me almost every day. He’s made it clear that he doesn’t want to be in a relationship with me again, but I know he cares about me. The constant reminder of him hurts though too. I’m not sure how to simultaneously accept that he’s gone as a lover, but that he can still care about me. Thank you for sharing."

BPD,fcgkiz2,t3_eh8n8l,1577641116.0,"You are feeling anxious because you feel abandoned. You cannot however project your feelings onto this other person. Unfortunately, you will have to wait until they have cell service again to open up that dialogue. I understand with a thousand suns that the anxiety you’re feeling is absolutely awful and you probably feel like you’re exploding. It’s so easy to take everything so personally when someone is unavailable, but you have to remember to direct that energy in healthier ways. You’ve already taken a step by posting your feelings and wanting to open up a dialogue with others. Thank you for sharing."

Instead of trying to change your core self, change how you react to the situations that trigger you. It will take a long time and a lot of work. Remember that actual change doesn’t happen overnight. Make goals. Don’t let your disease win."
BPD,fcg5hax,t3_eh5f52,1577636658.0,"I do think you are correct in distancing yourself. It would be difficult for anyone to feel like they are being ignored. It would also be difficult to always walk a thin line of did I offend them or is it just them being them feeling guilty/uncomfortable? Good luck moving forward, and acknowledge that it will be difficult for some time, but life does have a way of providing you with another healthier outlet."
BPD,fcg2u2u,t3_eh7ifs,1577635958.0,Death is never the answer you’re actually looking for. I’m sure you just no longer want to feel the way that you do right now. Why are you feeling this way?
BPD,fcg1wmz,t1_fcd0joa,1577635757.0,"Thank you. I know I’ve said some really nasty things over the years, but it was always from a place of insecurity and not actually hatefulness. I feel really awful right now, but I’m also on this journey of self discovery where I’m beginning to recognize that how I’ve acted is unhealthy and I want to get better."
BPD,fcg0jc3,t1_fcczm6d,1577635413.0,"Just remember we don’t want to feel this way, but our feelings are very valid. They are extreme and difficult to manage. Never say that we shouldn’t feel a certain way about something. Validate that we’re having the feeling that we’re having. One of my biggest pet peeves was when my ex would try to tell me what to do. I didn’t want that. I just wanted someone to listen. Your girlfriend may be different, so I would open up a dialogue with her and just remember if she gets angry it’s because she’s feeling insecure or threatened. Every time I exhibit an extreme behavior it’s because I feel threatened or trapped. Finding out what made me feel the way that I do and addressing the issue head on really helps curb my behaviors and further ill feelings."
BPD,fccqe1t,t3_eh151x,1577601407.0,"As someone who struggles trusting my partner, I cannot tell you how to make her feelings of depression completely subside, but certain things do help. A lot of the feelings of depression comes from feelings of abandonment. Reassurance that you will be coming home may have to be told numerous times, but we crave the constant validation. Another helpful avenue is to make sure you aren’t distracted while you’re talking to her. Lastly, don’t ever lie. It’s always better to be truthful, even if it makes you uncomfortable because once our trust is broken it’s almost impossible to repair."
BPD,fccnwqm,t3_eh1ws5,1577600575.0,I’m so sorry that you are experiencing these feelings. I’m actually experiencing some of these myself right now. It’s important to remember your own self worth. YOU are able to accomplish great things.
BPD,fccj968,t1_fcch8hw,1577599030.0,"Looking back I see instances where I would agree with whatever he wanted because I thought it would strengthen the relationship.

BPD,fcchlc9,t3_eh20wj,1577598478.0,"The anxiety is so much. It’s actually debilitating. I live in constant fear of abandonment, so I push everyone away. I’ve never felt normal. I’ve always felt like I’m living on the sidelines. I can’t express how I feel without worrying that everyone around me will think I’m crazy. I’m more self-aware now, but that only makes my anxiety worse because I see the pain I cause. Thank you for sharing."
