CBD,f6wxc56,t1_f6wv6q0,1573237018.0,"Wow - thank you so much for taking the time to write all that out! It is really going to help me when comparing products and finding what is best for me. I love that you have had specific experience in the dance world considering you said your daughters are dancers. Having a formulator that understands individual needs and putting that knowledge into each product is so important and gives me (customers) a sense of comfort in using the products. I do have another question... sometimes my pain is small and sometime the pain is overwhelming, what is your experience with knowing what dosage to use for different pain levels?"
CBD,f6wuan7,t3_dtgotk,1573235019.0,I am a dancer and have been trying to figure out what topical CBD products would be best for me to use. Obviously my body has been worked very hard and I experience a lot of pain in my joints after a long day of movement. Are there specific things I should be looking for in topicals and how do I know a company is reliable?
