It's not easy, it's a long road and there will be many times that you'll feel like giving up. But, it's possible. I speak from experience, 5 years ago I was in a dark place, feeling disgusted at the kinds of things I was jerking off to. After a huge amount of personal development, self improvement, counselling, changing my habits, my mindset and my environment, I'm in a place that I consider even better than if I'd never had experienced the darkness in the first place. Sure, going through it I'd have periods where I'd wonder if it's all worth it - but it is, every second.  

You're in your mid twenties - you've got a whole life ahead of you and in 5 or 10 years, you'll look back and recognise that this was the most important decision to make - and you'll recognise the beauty that you're currently missing."

Habits like meditation and exercise can aid in learning discipline and delaying gratification, which according to some sources can affect our brain plasticity positively, especially the prefrontal cortex. Also, psychotherapy and counselling have been proven to have a positive effect. 

[https://www.fastcompany.com/3032513/6-scientifically-proven-ways-to-boost-your-self-control](https://www.fastcompany.com/3032513/6-scientifically-proven-ways-to-boost-your-self-control)  

Even after years of addiction, neuroplasticity makes the brain able to change and create new pathways separate to the ones we have been creating and with every new streak and every day not spent in the PMO, these pathways increase while the previous ones decrease.

Yes, there's an argument to be made that it's not really an issue, but you need to follow your moral code and live with what you feel is integrity.

Take one day at a time and fill the time you once would have spent jerking it with things that are better for you - learning a new skill, learning to eat healthily, developing an exercise routine and following it, connecting with new people or reconnecting with people that you miss. As well as those ideas, plan your days and tick off the activities you complete, it'll really increase your motivation to keep going.    

Picking up meditation again may help with becoming aware of what triggers lead you to wanting to jerk it, as well as keeping your thoughts in check. Use the awareness and increased mental acuity to develop a long-term plan for your next year etc - a few positive actions can really snowball if you let it.  

Have you tried giving up before? 140 days is a great target to aim for, but be prepared for a serious challenge, remember to be kind to yourself if you don't make it to the full target - the decision to improve yourself, your thoughts and your actions, along with the positive activities you've implemented are more important than an arbitrary number of days not jerking it."

You mention that your parents' divorce affected your view on romantic relationships - have you ever explored counselling for the effects it had?  

I can only speak from my experience but I was once in a relationship that was loving and supportive on some levels, but also manipulative and controlling on others - I experienced heightened anxiety around this person and this improved considerably once we had finished - this was because I was aware (and avoiding my own awareness) that the relationship wasn't healthy for me to be in.

At 29, I'm currently about to start university for a counselling degree, having studied for the last 2 years while working a challenging job that has taken me right out of my comfort zone and supported me in conquering anxiety, I'm having counselling as a client to deal with the emotional trauma and repression, as well as low self esteem and limiting beliefs I had, to create a personality I am happy with. I've got a lot more social experience and am working on dealing with my relationship issues. Also at my physical peak after exercising consistently for the last few years.

In my experience it has changed my life immeasurably, firstly learning to deal with a lifelong anxiety disorder, then working through childhood trauma and abuse, as well as relationship and personality/limiting belief issues. A lot of the progress was made by the actions I took alongside counselling but they wouldn't have been so effective without it.  
Firstly, you have to realise it's your responsibility to keep digging deeper and make changes alongside it (it's not a magic cure-all just by talking to someone) and you HAVE to seek out a good counsellor - if you don't click after a little while, you're doing yourself a disservice by staying with them.

Biologically you're not the one causing the orgasm, that's better than fapping to porn in a darkened room - but looking at the emotional, mental side of things, paying for a massage with a happy ending, from someone who you have no connection with - it's your judgement whether there is any difference.
