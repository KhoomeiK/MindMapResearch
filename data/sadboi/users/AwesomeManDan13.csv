Bad problems can become good answers. And vice versa. If you allow yourself to be taunted by every undermining action then I understand how everything can be damaging. I get it, a close friend of mine has autism. Damaging things depends on the point of view, which is usually derived as ""good"" given from person to person. My mom is not the greatest. But she's my mother, in my situation it could be worse. I have only 15 months left till I can get out of dodge. Life is unfair for the most part. What you deal out of isn't always up to you. When you deal your cards you gave options to fold or to continue, but somebody might have a better hand.. or worse. See joy in all things that were made. Even the bad. Even the good.

Doing all of that would make it awkward. So I don't believe you are the asshole. More than that. Your Dad handled it well from the looks of it. It seems that your mom thinks you are her child and she can be entitled to whatever she wants to call you. Not acceptable. Growing up is one thing. But when you respectfully ask people to start calling you something is more than acceptable. You keeping calm and being collective is what you makes you NTA. Good job on handling it well!"
