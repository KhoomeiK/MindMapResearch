Plenty of 'social justice warriors' who take it all a bit too far. Personally I have only met transgender people who have fully transitioned (including operations). Maybe look up 'body dysmorphia' if you want to know more about that. These people display gender non-conformative behaviour in the eyes of the outside world, but they feel like they do not belong in the body they've been given. And these people I've met did not change their pronouns as often as their hair colour, they made just the one change.

On the other hand, if you're young and confused, that's okay too, right? In the hypothetical situation that a young kid claims a bazillion genders and wants me to use different pronouns and names every time I meet them, I'd treat the situation as if it was a friend who changed college majors every semester. Sure, I might still refer to them as a Political Science major while they're doing Art History now, but they shouldn't get upset about a slip up. If I continue to do it, I can see why that might make them uncomfortable. Didn't they state they're completely over Pol.Sci? I'll respect that.

So for example if you're feeling depressed, keep going out and seeing friends amd family, don't hide away in your sadness. If you're going towards (hypo)mania, plan some downtime. Try to release the extra energy in healthy ways like exercising. Keep a journal, whether it's something  simple like the Dailyo app or handwritten notes. Make sure it includes your mood that day, any disturbances in your sleep pattern etc. Inform your close friends and family about bipolair and what they can do if they see symptoms you might be ignoring. Keep regular contact with a health care professional and make sure you do have access to medication in case you're doing really bad and there are no other options (some meds are easier to take for a couple of weeks and quit than others).

Tinder,exff76k,t1_exfeb3c,1566239209.0,Haha yeah I'll update you if I decide to be stupid
suggestmeabook,exfc8fb,t3_csk0iv,1566237391.0,I'd recommend 'An American Marriage' by Tayari Jones
Tinder,exfa7pw,t1_exf657a,1566236128.0,Yeah fair enough. I do think of him sometimes. Wish it had ended better and we could have stayed friends. But I guess that ship has sailed
Tinder,exbpo91,t1_exbo6lc,1566135845.0,Mh alright. Idk it just seemed like a lot to me (I'm average looking and have a profile with only 1 pic and no bio). I have way less matches too.
Tinder,exbm0l2,t3_cs06pc,1566133934.0,I feel like it's fake. Showing you random blurry picks to entice you to buy Tinder Gold. I dowloaded the app last week and within an hour I had 99+ likes. I don't think that was even close to the real number...
