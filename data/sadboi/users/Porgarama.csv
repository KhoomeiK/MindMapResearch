Atlanta,fk411qa,t1_fk3vktv,1583851023.0,THANK YOU for stating this. Lots of commenters don’t seem to understand the force this virus has brought on the healthcare system and public health. Healthcare is trying to catch up to the outbreak. It’s going to take time since resources are currently limited with this new virus. Consumables need to be made and that takes time. Hospitals need to be in emergency priority mood and that takes bed space. There are many limitations but the workers involved are doing their best!

I remember I had band class with him and one day one of his buddies gave me a note and said it was from him. It said stuff like he liked me and wanted to go on a date or something. I went up to him and try to talk with him about it and he and his buddies laughed in my face. It was a joke and I was a joke to them. It felt like I was in one of those cheesy 90s high school movies where the shy, geeky girl gets picked on. 

Jokes on him though. He peaked in HS."
