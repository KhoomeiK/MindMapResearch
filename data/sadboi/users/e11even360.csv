Factorise the quadratic equation
2a^2 - 3a + 1 = 0

I got
a = 1/2 and a = -1

Substitute sin(thetha) for a and then thetha will be equal to the sin inverse of the values

I got 2 answers 

Thetha = 30° or Thetha = 270°

Since Thetha can be anywhere between 0° to 360° both the answers could be plausible."
