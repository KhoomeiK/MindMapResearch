For the OH-6 the only [reference](https://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/local/2015/05/04/legendary-pilot-observes-final-mission-oh-helicopter/26888113/) I found that mentioned pilot's seats said ""in the standard combat configuration, the OH-6 included a pilot in the right front seat, an observer in the left front seat..."" with a gun behind the pilot firing out the right. The article mentions the removal of the observer and addition of another gun. I'm not sure if this involved switching the seat from right to left or not and it seems a little ambiguous, though I admit I only skimmed the article. 

For the MD500 I found a [source](https://www.rotorandwing.com/2013/01/01/flying-the-md540f/) that mentions ""pilots who drive civilian versions of the MD500 know that the pilot-in-command sits in the left seat"" but does not explain why."

Darth Vader's suit is NOT an augmentation. It is a deliberate handicap and weakness designed by the Emperor. They could easy discard most of his already damaged body and intentionally inefficient cybornetics and place him in a full combat body exactly like was done with Grievous. He only coughs because of sustained damage that mostly likely could have been fixed. Medical technology is much more advanced than ours (think bacta tanks) and the best that it can do is definitely not Darth Vader's suit.

Edit: typo"
explainlikeimfive,fqho449,t1_fqhbzu2,1589380969.0,"Edit: I should have touched on this first but orbital mechanics is entirely about velocity, meaning speed and a direction. Essentially being in orbit just means you're going fast enough and in the right direction (speed doesn't help if you're heading straight down lol) that you miss as you fall to the Earth. Since there's not enough air or anything else to slow a satellite downs it keeps flying around the Earth fast enough to keep ""missing.""

This is not the real reason. The equator is the only place it is possible to keep something in geostationary orbit (meaning it stays above the same spot on Earth at all times.) Anything orbiting with an inclination (angle relative to the equator, anything more or less than 0 means it's not perfectly around the equator) that brings it north and south of the equator will move north and south relative to the ground. [This wikipedia page does a good job of explaining the difference.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit)

For a space elevator to work it needs to be anchored to something orbiting the Earth or it won't have enough strength not to collapse under its own weight. This is why orbits are important. A space elevator that is anchored to an asteroid or station in orbit will have to bend and move north and south to keep things in a straight line unless its on the equator. True geostationary orbits are only over the equator, while all others are in geo*synchronous* orbits. Basically all geostationary orbits are also geosynchronous but the reverse isn't true. 

If anyone's curious, objects in geostationary/synchronous orbit stay over the same point (or north/south line) relative to the Earth orbit the Earth once every in 24 hours.

Edit: Forgot to mention, an object tethered to the north pole would have no orbital velocity and would just fall straight down. Also forgot to mention what orbital velocity even is lol"

Edit: I obviously don't really mean that."

hotas,fqckyak,t1_fq9ttaq,1589260984.0,Do you just keep your hand on it the entire time? I'm curious because this is pretty cool but doesn't seem practical to use.
hotas,fqckj3x,t3_ghybsd,1589260651.0,vJoy and Joystick Gremlin are actually super easy to use. I don't know for sure if they could help you do what you want but definitely worth checking out at least.
windows,fq6yjp8,t1_fq6a1z3,1589139491.0,I just looked at mine and I can only see high performance. Are you looking under power options in the control panel?
RocketLeague,fpstoue,t1_fprlkgc,1588879446.0,I pretty much just use solo as a warmup playlist or if I want to play but not up to the level of effort needed for regular 3s.
