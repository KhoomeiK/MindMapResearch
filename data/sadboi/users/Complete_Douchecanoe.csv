SuicideWatch,eyhtyzb,t1_eygcyof,1567092689.0,What about a therapist or a peer support group in your area?
SuicideWatch,eyddg87,t1_eyczinp,1567016655.0,"Had that once too, although in my case it was the police transport that the suicide hotline had sent to transport me to the hospital since I said I wanted to go there but didn't feel safe driving myself.

I was LITERALLY sitting next to the tracks that I had told them my plan was to lay my head down on when a train came, but the officers decided it wasn't serious enough to warrant taking me in.

In a weird sort of twist it made me feel so worthless that even the police officers sent to save me had so little faith in me of being able to accomplish even killing myself that I gave up and walked home. So in a weird way their lack of faith in that regards was accurate and it's a bit humorous in hindsight now while at the same time being like ""Jesus, what if you were fucking wrong though guys?"""
mentalhealth,eydctcw,t1_eybupdm,1567016247.0,"This is my throwaway account, but I have done it myself with supervision from my boyfriend. Granted in my case I'm a ""kinky asexual"" (which translates to ""I'm not into sex, but I like cuddling and I really LOVE cuddling if you tie me up) and already have a thing for restraint, but the being cuddled while restrained is very calming. Granted we don't use handcuffs, and we invested in a good straitjacket because it's even more cuddly and gives me that calming cuddle effect in and of itself."
SuicideWatch,eyd5faf,t3_cwnb7u,1567011520.0,Why do you feel like you want to kill yourself? Have you talked to anybody else about it yet?
SuicideWatch,eyd4f5t,t3_cwncjg,1567011032.0,You aren't alone in feeling like this. This is the sort of thing I experience as well even though I rarely reach the point of being suicidal. Do you have a therapist or any trusted friends that you can talk to about these feelings?
SuicideWatch,ey85x6y,t1_ey7s4nd,1566912169.0,Sounds like the circle of support is there again now though?
SuicideWatch,ey7cjdd,t3_cvz1np,1566878352.0,"> But now Iâ€™m 22 and have basically no future that I would consider happy 

This part sticks out to me. Any particular reason you say that? Is there something going on, or otherwise present in your life that prevents you from advancing towards your goals? What are your goals, what is it that you would consider happy?"
SuicideWatch,ey6s6zu,t1_ey6r8c4,1566862769.0,"You dodged a bullet there in any case, as that is beyond unprofessional for a therapist to act like that."
SuicideWatch,ey6oy56,t1_ey6icaj,1566860618.0,You have any trustworthy people in a support circle of sorts that you'd be able to talk with during this or even possibly physically visit with until the urges subside?
SuicideWatch,ey6i2eb,t3_cvum7j,1566856100.0,"How strong of an impulse are we talking here? I've had pretty strong self-harm impulses before that I've been unable to resist. Do you feel like this is strong enough that you may fail to resist it?

Is there anything bringing this about that happened recently, or is it more of an ""out of the blue"" impulse?"
