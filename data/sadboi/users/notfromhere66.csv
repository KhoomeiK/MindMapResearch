>Despite the daily reports of additional confirmed cases and deaths, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced earlier this week that the [state’s coronavirus curve had flattened](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article242171271.html).  
>  
>But health experts are concerned the statewide total of confirmed cases is [significantly undercounted](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html) because Florida reports only the number of Floridians waiting to hear test results from state labs, not private ones — and private labs are completing more than 90% of state tests.  
>  
>The results of thousands of pending tests from private labs have taken as long as two weeks to be added to the state’s official count. The state’s website does not say its figures exclude the vast majority of pending tests for the [novel coronavirus](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/2019-ncov-factsheet.pdf).  
>  
>On Wednesday, DeSantis announced two new contracts with laboratories that will [increase COVID-19 testing ](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article242212796.html)capacity by 18,000 samples per day by using rapid tests that provide results in one or two days.  
>  
>More than 10 new walk-up sites would also be set up in Miami-Dade, Hillsborough, Duval, Leon and Orange counties in the coming weeks, he said.  
>  
>Three drive-thru testing sites in Miami-Dade — Marlins Park, the Youth Fair site at Tamiami Park and the South Dade Government Center — also began to schedule [free retesting appointments ](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article242217471.html)Thursday. The appointments are for those who previously tested positive for COVID-19 and want to be tested again.  
>  
>Previously, retesting for the disease was not allowed at the [free drive-thru sites](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241422246.html), forcing people to seek second tests from private healthcare providers, a more costly alternative.  
>  
>DeSantis is also expecting to receive [a list of recommendations](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article242053011.html) Friday from the Re-Open Florida Task Force, which had its first meeting Monday on how the state can reopen. On Wednesday, the task force — comprised of lawmakers and executives from large corporations — said it needed [advice from doctors](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article242215811.html) on what safety measures reopened businesses would have to follow."

When the anger rages and I think on it too much, then the depression will seep in.  It's like I am telling myself not to be angry, then all the negativity goes back on myself.

Paradox, try to be as healthy as possible to reduce the depression/bipolar only to be accused of anything and everything.  

Last DR, before I lost insurance, had me coming off of klonapin from one point of 2mg at night, to 1mg 2x a day to 1/2 mg at night.  Over 2 months.  So much for weening.  I have been on klonapin for so long, at least 2015 and some other benzo before then.

Coronavirus,fm9uzj0,t3_ftyr2h,1585877173.0,"## What about Capt Crozier's letter?

He had warned the Pentagon that the outbreak aboard his ship was “accelerating” because crew members were living in confined spaces.

""We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die,"" stated the four-page letter, dated 30 March.

Capt Crozier had called for ""decisive action"", saying uninfected sailors had to be removed from the ship and isolated.

The letter was later published by the San Francisco Chronicle.

## What has the reaction been?

In a statement, [**Democratic leaders of the House Armed Services Committee said:**](https://armedservices.house.gov/press-releases?ID=2EFC2A13-1968-4190-8215-F9E2FCCB133D) ""While Captain Crozier clearly went outside the chain of command, his dismissal at this critical moment... is a destabilising move that will likely put our service members at greater risk and jeopardise our fleet's readiness.""
