modernwarfare,fr49k71,t1_fr496wh,1589880709.0,"No one said it will download the whole game altogether. But the copying process is making a duplicate from the original file and the apply the new patch and then delete the old one. That’s why copying took more time than downloading the update. 

I tried deleting the game and re download the whole thing when season 3 update is live, it’s a little bit faster than downloading the update and wait for it to copy. Just a little bit tho"
modernwarfare,fr49400,t1_fr48prb,1589880239.0,"They can only work in the actual update itself. 

They are probably putting more stuff in for upcoming seasons (evidently data miners are finding more stuff in each patch), hence each updates are somewhat evenly sized (even tho being tens of gb) instead of each having 100gb or something like that per season. 

So I guess that begs the question: would you rather have tens of gb per each mid update, or a 100gb per season update..."

Perth has helped me tremendously during each and every difficult times. The opening guitar riff is just pure tranquility and serenity bringing a peace of mind. Combining how the ""power"" breaking through the distant in the mid-late section, Perth is simply a recalibration for everything to my mind. And each and every individual track on this album is a transcendence in the recording audio form and a transgression of its genre.

Your work never fails to accompany me and especially Perth, is as if a close family member just right next to me helping me through my bad times.

P.S. I will not live in fear :)

P.P.S Sometimes it's difficult for a guitar player to keep up with the whacky tunings!

HongKong,f271g43,t3_dc8018,1570028567.0,"It’s not a taboo if it’s true. 

I get the sentiment that comparing the ongoing issue in Hong Kong to nazi Germany, or even to slavery in America and that people should tread carefully. 

But one thing that everyone should realize is that no one can understand what it is like to be a slave back in the days; or to be a Jew in nazi Germany. Same thing goes with Hong Kong - no outsiders can understand what is truly like to be a Hong konger Post-handover. 

Everyone think about the physical cost of slavery / Jew massacre. Yea, in this sense, it’s incomparable to put nazi Germany and Chinese government onto the same equation because the instances and historical background are very different.

But in the same time it is the Power that penetrates into folks socioeconomic status and culture. And this is not only applicable to Hong Kong folks but also China folks as well, and eventually worldwide as China gains influence everywhere. Look at the social credit system among other things that dehumanizes and enforcing a Foucaultian tyranny. What the chinese government does simply benefits no one but their agenda and regime￼￼.

It is the Power that strips people’s culture, rights, values just to protect themselves, further strengthen and secure their power. Under such circumstances, the chinese government IS indeed comparable to the nazi Germany and slavery. I strongly oppose the idea that “comparing anything to any ‘taboo’ is a taboo”. There are no taboos, it’s history, as long as the facts are correct.

This type of conservatism that only focuses on “appearing to be right” than actually being right is killing the world. What, so because of a debatable metaphor does not fit in the dominant narrative (which in cultivated by one ideology or another) and thus people don’t need to care and don’t need to do anything? Stop it ASAP, less will suffer."

HongKong,f26vqas,t3_dc3mhs,1570024625.0,"You’ll be safe. Police only targets the locals. 

The cops in Hong Kong have very little english proficiency in due to their low education qualifications. Many of them barely passed or failed their high school qualification and probably need to spend extra effort in participating course just to get the high school qualification equivalent.

Most of the rookie cops in Hong Kong only join the police force because of their low education level and wouldn’t guarantee to have a safe job elsewhere.

The radical pro China folks won’t dare to give you any troubles if you’re a foreigner, I know it may seems very political incorrect but it’s true.

On the contrary, I believe the folks on streets will be very willingly to speak with you.
