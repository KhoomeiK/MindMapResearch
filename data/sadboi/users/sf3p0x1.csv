Chronic depression is no goddamn joke, and it will destroy you, your relationships, and everyone you love. That was a lot of stress to manage on your own, and yes, you were on your own. You need someone to talk to about the dark parts that scare you, the things that you don't want to share with your partner for fear of scaring them off. That's what a therapist is for.

Your partner also needs a therapist.

You've known this woman for ten years, and in ten years she hasn't changed her behavior at all?
