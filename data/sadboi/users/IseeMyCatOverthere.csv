I see my brother and sister with their respective spouses and they actually do things for each other. They spend time together and don't feel guilty about getting the other to do something with them. I see my mom is happy with her spouse. 
My relationship with my husband has been rocky for years now. I keep trying to fix it. I lay it out on a silver platter on what exactly I need. I ask him what he needs and he doesn't respond. I feel so alone. I have no emotional support. I run my household nearly single-handedly. We both work so he's a provider. He drops our daughter off to the babysitter. I pretty much do everything else. 

Like your stbxw my husband has no friends. He did that to himself. He let those relationships die just like he let his die with me. He has family which is good. He also has struggled with addiction issues in the past. I'm afraid if I leave him he'll spiral into that again. But then that's not really a marriage is it? More like a hostage situation. 

I want to be happy. I want to be loved the way I need to be loved. I crave emotional and physical intimacy and I'll never get it from him. I've been trying with all my might for years.

Divorce,fqx3ft7,t3_glb44r,1589724908.0,"I was a child of divorce. I'm all grown up now and almost 30. I'm well-adjusted, have a career, all that stuff. If anything, I wish my parents got divorced sooner. They fought CONSTANTLY. They were together for 18 years. It was like a weight was lifted after things got settled. I feel things could have ended a lot happier if they were honest with each other and themselves.

 My mom remarried some time later and is super happy. It's awesome. My dad, who was always mentally unstable and had addiction issues, died due to his issues. But he tried to kill himself many times over the years, he was gonna succeed at some point. I feel the divorce and his death happening close together was a coincidence. Married or not, he did a lot of dumb shit.

I feel the biggest ways this has effected me are:
- I'm not sure how a healthy relationship works
- I've always kept myself in bad relationships longer than I should have because I was afraid of how it would effect my partner. I never put myself first.
- I question myself when I get the urge to leave a relationship because I'm so afraid of wasting so much time like my mom did. Like, is this relationship salvageable, or am I just being fearful? 
- I'm twisting with myself currently with deciding if I actually want to get divorced right now.

This is because they DIDN'T get divorced when they should have.

TLDR; I'm not at all angry at my parents for getting divorced. Staying together for the kids is a good way to make them feel guilty for making you stay together when ya'll'd've been better off separated. 

Give them emotional support. Consider counseling. Let them grieve. Kids are more resilient than we give them credit for. Allow them time to adjust and adapt. It'll be okay."

My daughter's babysitter had a stomach virus and I got the message that she couldn't watch her after it was too late for me to call off. Basically, no one could watch my child and my work wouldn't let me leave early. I wasn't scheduled to work that day. It was a partial shift I picked up to help out.

I'm a nurse, I would've given report prior to leaving. Another nurse would take my patients. They were understanding to my situation.
My boss was less understanding and said that she would report me to the board of nursing for patient abandonment if I left early after giving report. They had no actual case against me, but it would need to be investigated and they knew I was quitting soon. I had put in a month's notice. That report would have prevented me from moving to my next job.

raisedbynarcissists,fmi1kfq,t3_fv2fwc,1586100417.0,"feel this deeply. Im going to say what comes to mind and it's about to get real disorganized, bear with me please. Your story reminds me so much if mine.
I've had trouble leaving a relationship where I was physically and sexually abused because I was so ashamed of myself and afraid of how my mom and step dad would treat me if I moved back home. They just had this special way of making me feel like I was nothing. Just their weak burden of a daughter.
When I moved back in with them it was business as usual again. Getting yelled at for every little thing. Being treated like a child. My mom even convinced me to get off of my psych meds because ""I shouldn't need them since I don't live with that asshole anymore."" I realize now, years later, how terrible it was of her to do that to me..

I met my current husband shortly after moving in with them and moved in with him within six months. My jumping around with boyfriends was a pattern in my late teens through my early twenties. My husband was the only one who was patient with me and didn't take advantage. I would have panic attacks, I would cry, I generally felt like a terrible person and he just listened. He didn't tell, he didn't hit me or insult me. He just listened and I never got that from anyone before.

Growing up, my real father (narcissistic af) was severely mentally unstable and was addicted to drugs. My mom, through some heavy self reflection, I have discovered had a some narcissistic traits. Life was always chaos, scary, it was traumatic at times. Without writing my whole childhood story, the events if my chilhood=teen years messed me up and set me up to be taken advantage of.

Through their own special ways I was taught never to question their actions, especially my mother. My mother tried her best to choose everything for me and scolded, scared, or punished me into taking her views. She was always right, I was always wrong. My dad mostly fought with my mom and tried to drag me and my siblings into it. Then he mostly tried to kill himself. Do drugs, and self harm in his spare time.

 They always wanted us to physically fight people of they threatened us or did us wrong. It was a rough place we grew up in. Fighting was normal. This was especially jarring to my brother and I as we were more peaceful tyoes. We refused to throw punches. We were shamed heavily for this. They said if we snapped and kicked their asses they wouldn't mess with is again. My brother and I were small though, like didn't go over 100 lbs until we were 15 small. They never taught us HOW to street fight. They also seemed to ignore that times had changed and if you win the fight, their friends would track you down after school and jump you. 

I was pressured into being the perfect student despite all this and I was. I was straight a's honor roll, ap classes, graduated in the top of my class. But this was a base line expectation. Get good grades, be successful or else. You will be shamed. You're worthless. I was grounded for getting a C in the 3rd grade. What's frustrating was that my youngest sister was never held to the same standards. She was celebrated for getting a C because she failed her classes all the time. She is still the family favorite. You should have seen how my mom and stepdad (stepdad came into the picture after my dad committed suicide.) reacted when my brother told them he was a music major! 

This is just the tip of the ice berg, as I'm sure your story is too. Keep going to counseling, keep reaching out.
I've distanced myself from my family and it's one of the best decisions I've made. My codependency with my mother was hard to break, it's still a struggle.
 Keep moving forward. You can do this."

What made me appreciate security more was working in a psych/acute detox hospital that had no security at all. Inpatient workers didn't even get panic buttons. Only intake staff did at the front of the facility because ""the clients are unpredictable"". Everyone had CPI training and they felt that was enough. Mind you, I'm a 5'3 120lb lady. When I questioned the lack of security they told me that as long as I execute my CPI holds correctly I would be able to handle a violent patient. They weren't kidding.
Not like management came running when we had a 6'3 300lb behemoth going apeshit.

I didn't know about the security situation until I was hired in and working the floor. 

I would like to add that in my experience patients are more likely to act a fool when their nurse is female.  So many situations I've been in magically deescalate when the male nurse shows up and talks firmly.
Like, I had a guy literally trying to back me into a corner, squaring up to fight me. He wasn't a psych patient and he was discharged. He was mad because he was missing his shampoo. He was Yelling and carrying on, posturing himself. Guy nurse walks up to investigate and the patient is all ""I wasn't gonna do anything man."""

I didn't want to make scene, but that was offputting . I just put the condoms in my purse and went about my day all annoyed and stuff."
AskReddit,fj66uaj,t3_fbsfdi,1583059680.0,Put a small layer of toilet paper down in the water before you use a public toilet. You won't get splashed and your poops don't make that plop noise.

 It's weird having freedom. The most frustrating thing from this is learning that it doesn't matter what they think anymore. I spent so much if my adult life trying to please them (mostly my mother) and I was never good enough. It was hard to let that shit go.

I started seeing a counselor to work through this. I hope you're able to get through this blockage in a healthy way. My heart goes out to you."
AskReddit,fj59z77,t1_fj56p7d,1583027744.0,I feel like this too. Stagnation is a fear of mine. You might find some comfort in picking a subject you've always been about and immersing yourself in it. You don't have to dislike yourself to change. Keep learning about things you love.
AskReddit,fj5939p,t3_fbmiqt,1583027134.0," I feel like I followed the path my parent wanted for me, not the one I wanted. I felt like I was always in a crisis. Like I needed to accomplish a certain thing by a certain time or I was worthless and a burden. 

Now that I've made it through the difficult stuff, I can just be. And I don't know how to do that. It freaks me out and it feels like something like this should be so simple."

When I first got it put in my cramps were moderate-severe, but I took a motrin 800 and I was fine. I bleed a little heavier, but not a concerning amount. I don't have to worry about getting pregnant and I don't have to remember to take a pill every single day."

MMFB,fiu0flm,t1_fitfx9y,1582733005.0,I forgot to mention I had another rash like this due to carpet beetle larvae one summer. I would get these red/purple bumps that felt like bruises.  I figured it out because I found them in my cloth cat carrier and I was the only one in the apartment to frequently sit on the ground. That explained why no one else had this problem. I stopped sitting on the ground and the rash improved. Then we promptly moved out of that critter infested apartment.

 My only exception to this is eating celery when used sparingly and it's diced into tiny pieces. That's it.

Thank you for your correct opinion."
