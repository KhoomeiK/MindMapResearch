abuse,eruaz69,t3_c3xbvk,1561270186.0,"It's completely possible. Abuse victims will sometimes purposefully subject themselves to abuse because it's what the confuse to be love. Also because they have a deep rooted interest in ""fixing"" or otherwise making light of their trauma  by vicariously projecting their past abusers onto new abusers. 

However.

It doesn't sound like you're addicted to abuse.

It sounds like your abuse has affected your libido and sex life. 

In my opinion, there's nothing wrong with having taboo fetishes as long as they don't hurt others or yourself. If your fantasy is to be degraded, there's not necessarily anything bad about that unless you're internalizing the degradation. Are you? Or are the degraded feelings fun and short lived? It may be cathartic for you to feel this way during sex, even if it doesn't make very much sense to you. 

 If this gets you off and you're safe and your partner is safe and you're both consenting adults**,** I say have at it. And don't feel bad about it. Just enjoy it. There's nothing wrong with it, and doesn't mean you're victimizing yourself. That said, I also think it's important for there to be romantic, caring sex in a relationship. It contributes to sexual and emotional health.

I recommend you look into therapy to work out your sexual feelings, and blockages. Maybe this will help you come to terms with the following things: You have taboo kinks, they aren't hurting anyone, they get you off, and that's fine,you should enjoy them if they don't hurt you. You struggle with making love, but there are things that you and your partner incorporate into your sex life to make romantic, sexual interaction a more prevalent part of your intimate life. And a therapist, a good one-- will help you out with that. 

Much luck to you."

Your constant interchangeable use of communist and socialist lingo prove that you are uneducated on either philosophy. I’m not a communist, and I have not once during this argument suggested a communist approach to any problems faced by the modern American world.

I have not  ONCE suggested that the possibility of poverty being eliminated is possible, all I have done is point out that pure capitalism can not prevent or halt poverty because of inflation, my main point which you have failed to even once address.

Democratic socialism does not enable poverty. It makes life for the poor more comfortable because of the presence of social systems.

The objective is not to eliminate poverty, it is for poverty to be manageable. It isn’t, because we don’t have strong social systems in place. And because we don’t, people are forced to play “climb the ladder” but entire generations cannot do that because of the threat of inflation, which again, you have failed to address."

You are the only person that you don’t have the option of living with, so you have live life for yourself. Accept your job, and move on with your life. Everything you need to survive is already within you. This MAN is dangerous for you as well as your emotional, and financial welfare."

todayilearned,erdsiob,t1_erdqgxz,1560755156.0,"Do you even know what inflation is? 

If every single man and woman living in poverty right now got a job that payed enough for them to sustain middle class lives, inflation would threaten the class division, and the price of living would go up. That entire generation of people would be just as poor as they originally were. You also realize that Republicanism was totally different when Abraham Lincoln was alive, right? 

What makes you think that I’m a communist? How do you know I’m not a Republican? I see flaws in a system that enables poverty, and I call those flaws like I see them.  

I don’t even oppose a free market, I just oppose a society that depends as heavily on a free market as ours does today."

sex,erdpsim,t3_c1jxzg,1560751389.0,"Do some crazy shit before you get into it. Take her on some fun adventures. Go sky diving, mount a roller coaster, or just try something new. Higher adrenaline will result in more production of testosterone, and better sex. Memorable, binding experiences are good for a relationship anyway, and making some new ones will definitely tie you sexually and emotionally. 

I think that’s really important too. To emotionally connect before sex. I know that’s not everyone’s thing, but I personally recommend it and find it really nice. 

Alternatively, sex after working out is supposed to be really good. I wouldn’t know, I’m a lazy fuck. But as far as fun experiences go, I can anecdotally guarantee that they’ll spice up the sex life."

ptsd,erd52n4,t3_c1fu7n,1560731132.0,"Go to a professional before you decide to start self diagnosing. There are a lot of disorders you could or could not have.

While PTSD is curable, most people are not necessarily ""cured"" of PTSD. However, leading a manageable, happy life and having PTSD are not mutually exclusive, you can have both if develop positive coping skills and grounding techniques. These things happen in therapy.

An individual's PTSD will not improve unless they are seeking out legitimate, medical attention. If you do, in fact, have PTSD, you will not be able to heal on your own. In fact, waiting for it to ""get better on its own"" is proven to worsen symptoms. You need to face what happened to you in a safe, productive environment, or your trauma will always haunt your subconscious."
depression,erd3wz9,t3_c1bybr,1560730146.0,"I feel really close to my boyfriend when he cries in front of me. I was severely child abused. As a result, I have an irrational fear that I'm surrounded by sociopaths. When he just lets go and tells me how he's feeling, not only am I that much more familiar with him, not only do I understand him on a deeper level, I feel like I've just interacted with a human being, not some vacant, emotionless void.

Obviously, I would hate it if he were just using me as a canvas for his neurosis, and our relationship was based on a dynamic of venting, but I appreciate his venting.

I think people feel overwhelmed by emotion, and that's why they have difficulty empathizing with others. I stopped being afriad of pain a long time ago, this makes the process of leaning in, and letting others lean in much easier. I wish more people were like this."

AskReddit,ercw9od,t3_c1flt0,1560723738.0,"My ex boyfriend became ~~very~~ mildly emotionally abusive during the last few months of our relationship. Guy wasn't a wife beater or anything, but he was definitely not what most women fantasize about when they're dreaming up a fictional relationship. I was in denial of the abuse following our breakup, but two weeks away from him and my self esteem rocketed. My interest in him subsequently died. But, he kept insisting that I was still in love with him. This was  inaccurate and kind of manipulative.

Ironically, I ended up falling inlove with his childhood best friend, some kid who he was close to during middle school. We were all mutual friends at some point, and I never thought I'd develop feelings for him. Let's call his middle school buddy Kevin. I invited Kevin over at three in the morning the day of my break up (or I guess, technically the day after?), because I felt dejected and disappointed by my failed romantic endeavor.

I wasn't looking for anything with Kevin, I just knew he was up, since that's when he gets off of work. We just played music together. He's a guitarist, I'm a pianist. We made a song about our exes. And that just kept happening. He kept coming over and making music with me, and I sort of fell in love with him through that. Our music is everything I love about him intellectually, emotionally, and creatively, and everything I love about myself intellectually, emotionally, and creatively all put together.

At first, I was terrified. I thought, holy shit, I can't date my ex's middle school bro. You know, I was in a pickle for a minute.

But. I got over it by saying ""Fuck it"" and asking him out. Life's short, and they knew each other when they were kids. Who gives a fuck? They were never that close after high school and my ex cheated and humiliated me on a regular basis.

Kevin and I live together now."

offmychest,erbp1wl,t1_erbop54,1560689278.0,"If you put yourself out on the line, you might get hurt, you might fail. That’s a total possibility. But it’s just that: a possibility, not a certainty.

However, if you spend your life terrified of failure and being hurt, and close yourself off from the world as a result, you will inevitably get hurt.

Additionally, avoiding happiness as a means to avoid pain and failure is a failure in and of itself.

You’ve got a date coming up. Go clean up, practice your pick up lines, and try the very best you can (I know, easier said than done) to get out of your head and have fun. 

Really. Just try to have a fun time, and get an enjoyable evening out of this. Even if this relationship doesn’t work out long term, you will have walked away with a neat experience."
