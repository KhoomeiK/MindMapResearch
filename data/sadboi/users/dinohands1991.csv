It would be in their best interests as a business to have you buy more things, falsely telling you you don't have enough days is not something a dispensary will do.  It could be: a dispensary you shopped at didn't enter your MMC number correctly and your previous purchases didn't get reported, they saw the problem, fixed it, and your purchases at that dispensary got uploaded to OARRS after the fact.  Could be that you looked at the number you see when you log in to the Ohio medical system, which is not a reflection of how many days you actually have.  As others have said, they are looking at the state database to calculate your days, chances are better that you were incorrect about how many days you had or somebody fat fingered your order on a previous visit and charged you too many days."

In my opinion, a dark minifridge is your best option for storing concentrates.  Dark, because UV light degrades THCA into THC, and then into CBN (sleepy cannabinoid).  Cold, because heat causes that same chain of events that UV light does."

The ""sweet spot"" can be where you achieve adequate symptom relief or when you have trouble keeping your eyes open, depending on who you ask.  I know, personally, if I have a time period where I am using heavily, my tolerance for edibles will also be much higher."

At Strawberry Fields you can get the same container for $625, and they had a 20 day long 20% off sale this month which would make it $500.

One of the things I would ask people is what is your experience level/history with cannabis?  If you are relatively new, something like Burkle might be good.  One of the parent strains is Granddaddy Purp, and it is a nice relaxing pain-killing strain.  Not too expensive, good smell.  Cresco just came out with a new batch of Pineapple as well.  There are lots of tincture options, but the One Orijin tinctures have some of the highest amounts of THC for the dollar value.  Edibles wise, lots of people swear by Wana Blueberry indica gummies for sleep, if they fall within your tolerance level (10mg per gummy).  If they are too strong you can cut them up.  When it comes down to it, there are tons of options, and more often than not it takes a bit of trial and error to find out what works best for you because everyone responds differently to different strains/products.  Some people told me that indicas gave them energy and sativas slowed them down, which is the opposite of conventional wisdom.  Ask your budtender, do a consultation if it is an option, and try a few things until you find something that helps."

Nice and potent, similar effects to Peach Crescendo.  Even though it doesn't feel like a sativa, it is worth noting that the first thing I did the two times I've vaped this so far is to start cleaning.  I enjoy this strain, would probably buy again, but not one of my favorites."
OhioMarijuana,fnx4de1,t3_g4fbu1,1587331240.0,"Good question.  My preferred order is 1. Flower 2. Concentrates 3. Carts 4. Edibles.  I like flower because I have a relatively low tolerance and I've got a room in my house with an attached non-insulated/ventilated walk in closet that is off limits to the kids, so I have a bit more privacy as far as grinding/storing/vaping is concerned.  I like the look, feel, taste, everything about flower.  Concentrates are awesome, potent, flavorful, but sometimes more than I need because of my low tolerance.  Carts are convenient, inconspicuous, but lacking the depth to the high that I feel like flower and concentrates provide.  Edibles are fun, different, but last too long for practical use and have lasting after effects that interfere with my ability to be 100% clear headed at work the next day.  I generally only medicate at night after the kids are in bed.  If you are looking for an easier vape method, consider something like the G Pen connect in conjunction with a rig for a cheaper option or a Puffco Peak or Dr Dabber Switch for concentrates.  No torch, regulated temps, tasty dabs and easy set up.  Potent, too.  I use a Mighty for flower and that is perfect for me, just got it a few weeks ago and I'm never looking back.  Low maintenance compared to the old Vivant Ambit, and even vaporization with good flavor.  No need to stir."

I had such a good experience with Lemon Royal and Larry OG I decided I had to get a couple more from OCL.

If you look on the bottle the actual amount of THC is .29% and the THCA is 30.8%.  When the THCA is heated it loses the ""A"" and converts to THC (called decarboxylation), which isn't a 1:1 conversion.  THCA itself doesn't have the intoxicating effect.  Further, if you eat the decarboxylated flower the THC would become 11-hydroxy THC and have a somewhat different effect from regular delta-9 THC, which is why edibles also have a different effect than smoking or vaping.

Not overwhelmingly potent, but I really like it.  This batch is 27% THC.  Also it is worth noting that Ancient Roots has begun including humidity packs with their flower, which I'm a big fan of.  Next is Kings Mustache from Buckeye Relief, which is an indica at 27% also.  Not much of a smell to it, very dense frosty buds.  It'll be better once its had a chance to rehydrate a bit, seems a little dry.  Haven't had a chance to form a solid opinion on this one yet.  Last is the Platinum Dosi live rosin from Firelands Scientific, which smells great, looks great, but haven't had a chance to try it yet.  This one should be an indica dominant hybrid, and was an impulse buy.  I didn't know it was on the menu and it was the last one, plus everything was 20% off at Strawberry Fields until 4/20, so the rosin was around $60 plus tax for a gram.

I haven't tried it yet, but I want to.  It doesn't smell as good as the Ancient Roots strains I've had/seen.  My perspective is this: Firelands has the best concentrates and vape pens, and their edibles are very good.  They are an intelligently run company, one of my favorites.  Ancient Roots has ""small batch"" or ""artisan"" appeal, no mass produced feel to their products, well cared for and trimmed.  Always high terpene levels, just top notch flower.

The blueberry has a distinct blueberry smell, it is really awesome.  Garlic cookies from riviera creek is from a relatively new grow cycle.  Up until january we were reaching the end of an old batch, all the bags had tiny super dry nugs.  What is out now is all relatively new, so hopefully bigger, fresher nugs with a stronger smell.  If you like lower thc bud too, I'd recommend burkle and oro blanco.  Burkle smells great, kinda grapey, and awesome for pain.  Oro smells like paradise circus, citrusy and floral, awesome smell."
OhioMarijuana,flvkpvi,t1_flvjmsf,1585525943.0,"I'm a big fan of Ohio Clean Leaf, usually has a good strong smell and the buds always look great.  Sticky Buns was all anyone would talk about for a good while, but has since fallen into relative obscurity.  The Larry OG I have is nice, but not as good as the Lemon Royal.  Meigs County (Agrimed) is a different story.  I think around November or so there were a lot of different strains from them that had a LOT of seeds, which to me indicates some carelessness from the growers.  I heard of 10+ seeds in a single 2.83 of either Matherly's Private Reserve or White Tahoe Cookies, but I'm not certain which (I know they both had seeds). I haven't had any Meigs County this year because of it, but the Honey was really nice when I had it.  They have come out with a lot of new offerings and I'm interested to try them again, I'm just not sure where to start.  Have you tried them yet?"
OhioMarijuana,flvhwdv,t1_fluqg3z,1585524168.0,"One thing I'll say about Ancient Roots is that their terpene game is on point, and that makes a difference to me.  I feel like cultivators like buckeye relief and pure ohio wellness in particular usually don't smell like much of anything, so I never end up pulling the trigger on them.  Every strain I've had from Ancient Roots (Ethos Apex, Golden Goat, Blueberry, Peach Crescendo) have smelled amazing and have had great effects and potency.  Even the 21%ers like the Ethos and Blueberry caught me off guard with how potent they felt.  Definitely give them a shot if you ever see them in your local dispensary, but they seem to have the most presence in southern Ohio."
OhioMarijuana,flvgt5o,t1_flvea7t,1585523497.0,"The grapehead was $80, which is as low as I've seen it anywhere including Strawberry Fields and About Wellness, and the Peach was $43, which is about as low as you'll see Ancient Roots tier 2's anywhere.  Mad river is only noticeably more expensive when it comes to teens-range thc levels.  They've got halves of tier 2's (Cresco) for $140.  They may have been more expensive late 2019, but they are generally priced the same as Strawberry Fields and marginally more expensive than About Wellness on 2.83's now."

OhioMarijuana,flsgqvz,t1_flsfwqh,1585441754.0,"I agree.  Awesome taste, very potent, interesting blend of initial strong sativa effects, followed about 45 mins to an hour later with couchlock and a mildly indica feeling.  I've been told it grows as an Indica but the terpene profile gives it the sativa effects it has.  Always between 30-35%, except for mid-late 2019 I think there were some 28-29% batches."
OhioMarijuana,flsgb6c,t1_flse4jc,1585441473.0,"Well to be fair, I've cycled through probably 5-8 other Michigan strains in the amount of time I've had all these other ones, which is like 4 months.  I hang on to the good ones just to have a nice treat if I feel like it.  All the Ohio strains pictured I've bought in the last 2 weeks except for the blueberry, and I'm not usually in the mood for indicas so I still have some.  Also, even though the Michigan strains are super frosty, the potency is mostly average.  The oreoz in particular will explode with kief in the grinder but it takes a couple sessions in the vape to do what a single session will with the Orange 43 or Lemon Royal."
OhioMarijuana,flsf3aj,t3_fqv75g,1585440696.0,"To start off, I have a bit of a buying problem.  Whatever I end up buying and I'm not a huge fan of usually gets turned into edibles after a few months.  The Michigan strains I have are pretty frosty, but I've been generally using more of the Ohio strains because on average I enjoy the effects more.  My favorites out of what I have pictured are the Orange 43, Lemon Royal, Gushers, and Chem D moonlight melts rosin.  Ancient Roots is my favorite brand, and I've finished Golden Goat and Ethos Apex since I've had all of these.  I generally prefer the Sativa dominant hybrids, social, clear headed, focused feeling.  The Michigan strains were all $60 a quarter, which is hard to beat for the quality."
OhioMarijuana,flsahxg,t1_flsa4h4,1585437840.0,"Sure.  Both of these were purchased at Mad River Remedies in Dayton.  A lot of the Woodward jars have somewhat smaller buds in them,  I looked at 7 or 8 different jars until I noticed the big buds in this one and I had to get it."
OhioMarijuana,fls7gyt,t3_fp24zx,1585435986.0,"I was previously employed by a processing facility, and I and my coworkers had strong suspicions the testing labs are pumping out inflated numbers.  As a testing lab, it definitely pays to come back with high numbers, and it seems like a lot of them are from North Coast testing.  The person I worked with who communicated with the lab told me they would ask ""what are you expecting back from this one?"" which is an odd question to ask in my opinion.  Also, after looking at testing data from metrc for the entire state of oregon for a whole year, and seeing only like 12 total batches come back over 30%, that also makes me suspicious.  I find it hard to believe that so many growers who just got the ball rolling in Ohio are coming back with such high numbers, when the same brands (like Calyx Peak) operate in different states that don't have nearly as many 30%+ strains as we do and have had med and rec programs for years and years."
OhioMarijuana,fls5gq0,t1_flmi075,1585434760.0,"It seems like the lemon royal either leans skunky or just a bit lemony, depending on the batch.  The batch I have now is more skunky, fairly potent smelling, very nice.  It doesn't give me a very strong sativa vibe, but for me the difference between indica and sativa can be somewhat subtle.  I like the appearance of OCL's buds.  Also, I've been hearing about some pretty nice discounts on the 56.6 gram buckets of it that strawberry fields carries.  Can't say that I'll ever commit to that size container though."

OhioMarijuana,fibuze7,t1_fibkvn9,1582330756.0,"The vast majority of the pens in Ohio are CO2 oil that has been winterized with ethanol, this being one of them.

I have seen one from Cokoh (Cure Ohio) that is distillate though."

Dabs,fhnjr5p,t1_fhn1qjc,1581727748.0,"If THC and THCA are soluble in alcohol, a product that is supposedly 50 to 70% THC should at least break down in alcohol, and relatively quickly.  If almost nothing dissolves, what does that tell you about the product?  Also, in the post I wrote that it is not a definitive test."
Dabs,fhg0oo2,t1_fhfgzfu,1581555832.0,"So I've got some of what I think other people are talking about.  I've currently got what is supposed to be four different strains: gelato, platinum og, GSC and zkittlez.  They all have an identical appearance and smell, except for the gelato, which has a weird opaque look to it.  They all smell and taste like limonene.  I don't notice much of a difference in effect, and they aren't particularly potent.  I haven't noticed much of a lemony smell from flower versions of any of those strains.  I've also had other strains that tasted identical as well.  The lemon flavor isn't bad, but it is followed up by a kind of funky diesely/motor oil taste/smell.  This is for every strain of this type of wax I've tried, which is close to 10. Here is a picture: [https://imgur.com/a/oI6nQcq](https://imgur.com/a/oI6nQcq) BTW all 4 strains are mixed up in that jar, and I've had this stuff for probably 2 months and it looks exactly the same as when I purchased it.  I am dissolving some in 91% ISO right now and after two hours it is structurally the same, just turned white.  I will try to remember to post a picture after I give it a few more hours to dissolve.  Also, I am in Ohio if it makes any difference.

EDIT: words."
OhioMarijuana,fh3u01a,t3_f1c9jo,1581272314.0,"In Ohio, definitely one big requirement is being willing to accept low wages for the work.  Even getting a job as a budtender is difficult unless you know someone working there already.  Typically there are hundreds of applicants within the first couple days of any listing, and having experience in the industry is one of the biggest things that will get you near the top of the list.  A degree in horticulture will definitely help getting a job as a grower, though.  For perspective on the pay side, I heard Cresco was offering somewhere around $10 an hour for a trimming job. For budtending, I've seen from $14 to $16 an hour, with not much room for raises.  I knew someone with a chemistry degree making $18 as the head person doing CO2 extraction.  All this being said, I'm sure there are a couple places that pay/treat their employees better, but I've definitely seen a trend toward the ""employees are a dime a dozen"" mentality in Ohio.  If you want to get an edge, go to a ""meet the cultivator"" day at a dispensary, have a conversation with someone who is higher up, and demonstrate knowledge and that you would be an exceptional employee in any industry.  A lot of people show up to interviews at dispensaries wearing things like cargo shorts and a normal branded t-shirt.  Just because they like weed doesn't mean they will respect you the same if you dress casually."
OhioMarijuana,fgxhtya,t1_fgt58ir,1581173002.0,"Funny thing about those Catfish vape pens: they don't actually use the catfish strain to make them.  I worked at a dispensary and checked the metrc paperwork when they came in, it lists all the strains that go into the individual products.  There were about ten of them, including Josh D OG, OG Kush and O'Ryan, which are all indicas, but no catfish. I never got a chance to try them, but I wondered how they could get away with doing that."
trees,fgsgcwq,t1_fgs5ova,1581083579.0,"In Ohio, tier 1 is up to 23%, tier 2 is 23% to 35%, so you don't often run into the issue of growing over 35% THC flower and having to process it.  The flower is actually really good, and nowhere near $480 an O most of the time.  I can get a half of 25% Lemon Royal for $175 10 minutes from my house, and it is damn good.  The only lower quality bud I regularly see at dispensaries is much cheaper, and typically from one grower in particular (Pure Ohio Wellness).  The medical program has come a long way, but it still has a good ways to go.  If it has been a while since you've been in a dispensary here you should check it out.

EDIT: Just remembered the local dispo also had halves of GG4 at 30% for 140 last week and it was good quality, just gotta shop around."
