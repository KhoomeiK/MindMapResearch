depression,f0uuje5,t3_d6dxpl,1568951231.0,"Allow me to let you in on a little secret... 

.... relationships are hard. They are work. Even for those without mental illness. Society, social media, hollywood, and books have deeply distorted the reality of relationships. They arent fairy tales and ""I will love you no matter what"". They are sometimes getting pissed at your partner. Finding them unattractive or annoying. Not wanting to spend time with them because you want to do things on your own. They are miscommunication and misunderstanding. 

But that's what makes them beautiful. 

Because when you want a relationship with someone, what you are really saying is that you want to grow with them. And in so so many ways relationships HEAL us in ways we never thought possible. No, I don't mean your partner will save you and suddenly ask your problems go away. In fact, being in a relationship makes your problems more visible. But relationships force you to look inward at yourself. Your partner becomes a reflection of your own self views and beliefs. 

Love is not a feeling. 

It is a choice and a daily, committed action. That even when it's hard and you don't want to keep going, you do it anyway. 

I say all this as someone who has learned, and is still learning, so much about love in the last year with my current partner.... 

And btw... 

I have PTSD, OCD, and depression. He has BPD, BP 2, ADHD, PTSD, and severe depression/suicidal ideation. 

It's not easy. And it's a struggle every day... but its possible. 

And it's worth it."

TwoXChromosomes,es88vf9,t3_c695nu,1561690653.0,"A lot of time and self love. The latter of which I'm still working on several years later. Allow yourself to have any and all emotions that come up. Being numb is completely normal and valid. But when the time comes for you to suddenly feel EVERYTHING, allow that to happen to. 

Find a good, stable support system. Tell them that you dont need their pity or their anger. YOU tell THEM what you need from them in that moment. Find a good therapist if you need one. Talk to a doctor ASAP.

Most importantly, remember that what happened isnt your fault. You are in no way to blame for what happened. 

For me that last part has always been the hardest. So I understand what you're going through. Three time rape survivor, and I can assure you that the days after are always awful. But it's the hauntings of the incident that appear years later that are the worst. However, always remember that those feelings too will pass. And that you are allowed to feel however you need to for as long as you need to. Healing is not linear.

And I totally understand that. As does my boyfriend (he read over my shoulder). Sexual assault is seriously one of the worst things human beings do to other human beings. 

Please keep in mind that while you may think that her being there prompted the incident, in the end it was the decision THAT MAN made because he believed he had the right to. 

No matter where you are, what you are drinking, what you are wearing... rape and sexual assault are ALWAYS a choice made by the ASSAULTER. Not the victim. 

Right now she just needs your support and to know that someone is listening to her. Ask her what she needs from you in the moment. Thank her for opening up and confiding to you about what happened."
TwoXChromosomes,es84rh6,t3_c6dzuo,1561687842.0,"As a survivor of multiple rapes I can offer this anecdotal advice:

The best thing my current boyfriend ever did when hearing what has happened to me was hug me. He didnt say a word, no ""I'll kill them"" no ""fuck those guys""... he just held me. He gave me time and space to talk about what happened. He allowed me the security to talk and the warmth of his embrace as comfort after. He held my hand. He didnt press me with questions. 

He just reassured me that he loved me. That I was safe. That I was valued and loved. Looking back at that conversation, I could tell how heated he was. How angry he was. How badly he wanted to strangle all of them. But he knew in that moment that that wasnt what I needed. 

Instead he sat with me. As I lost consciousness and fell in and out of flashbacks and blackouts for 2 hours. He gave me space when I asked for it. And he held me when I needed to feel someone's arms around me. 

That night i fell hopelessly in love with him for just that reason. 


So my advice to you is to let her express how she feels on her own time. On her own terms. I can understand why you may feel upset or angry, but please keep in mind that that is the last thing she needs from you right now. That she needs from anyone right now. 

Just love her and give her security and a safe space. She will appreciate that more than your anger and frustration."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ernfkxp,t3_c2yl57,1561051556.0,"Hi! For starters I want to applaud you for taking control of your own body. I know that this process is daunting and you might feel alone, but please know that millions of women have sat where you are about to. 

I can only speak from my personal experience, so in the end your experience may vary. Please keep that in mind. Also this response may be long. And feel free to message me directly if you have any questions!!

For starters, since you are over the age of 18, your mother does not legally have the right to know why you are being seen by a doctor unless you authorize it. Now, idk how it works with billing exactly, but I know in my personal experience I had to request from the doctor that my chart be flagged and some things put as confidential due to my mom being the office manager at my drs office (I had to get an std screen once and it was this huge ordeal about how no one could tell my mom why I was in there). 

As for whether you can get the prescription at your already scheduled visit, you absolutely should be able to. The doctor might request that you get a pap smear done, especially if you are already sexually active. But that is standard protocol and labeled as a ""physical"" for adult women. She should be able to send in/give you the script for your birth control there and then you just wait until its filled. Idk what insurance you have/pharmacy you go to, but most pills are crazy cheap. 

On that note, do your research about the pills and make a list of questions you want to ask your doctor regarding them and how they can interact with your body. All pills and bodies are different, so it's important to monitor and know how your body reacts. 

There are also options such as the DepoProvera shot and the IUDs incase you are worried about your mom seeing the pills. Again, do your research and be your own advocate. 

If going through your doctor becomes not an option, there are also websites and places you can go to to receive pills and have them delivered. So that could be a possiblity too.

I hope this helps you. Feel free to message me if you have any other questions!!"
