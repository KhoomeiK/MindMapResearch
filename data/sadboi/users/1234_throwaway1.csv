Anxiety,fl9lk85,t1_fl97j77,1584961069.0,"Let us know what the results are. I've been weak/lightheaded for a few days now. My breathing is much better, though I still find myself being short of breath every once in a while."
Anxiety,fksxw6a,t3_fki8d4,1584501019.0,"I can't begin to Express how sorry I am for your situation. I can't give much advice, but stay strong and under no circumstances hurt yourself. Hurting yourself brings only pain to those around you. If you feel like you're suicidal, get help immediately. Life is short as it is, don't rush to the end."
Anxiety,fkspj89,t1_fksiimx,1584495413.0,"Remember this previous flu season we had that was really bad? I've heard several doctors say they believe this was coronavirus then. No way to prove that now, but I've heard this on a couple different occasions. But yeah, I feel you. This is an awful time to have anxiety."
Anxiety,fksp4oa,t1_fksife5,1584495146.0,I just got prescribed Lexapro and hydroxyzine. The hydroxyzine doesn't seem to help much and might actually increase my anxiety. Keeping my mind off of breathing and occupied with other things helps too.
Anxiety,fks4vu3,t1_fks4aj5,1584482333.0,"I read that too and went down a huge rabbit hole of information on Dyspnea (shortness of breath) causes and how it relates to anxiety. I tried breathing into a bag to ""adjust"" my Co2 levels, but just got dizzy. I honestly believe we are just hyper focused on our breathing."
Anxiety,fks3ubd,t3_fkdbca,1584481721.0,"Buddy, you're just fine. I'm going through the exact problem right now. I've been dealing with it since last Wednesday and have had full blown panic attacks over it every day and sometimes multiple times a day. Try to get your mind off of your breathing. Right now, you're hyper focused on every breath you take. Normally, your body does ""silent breathing"" which means you don't notice it. Right now you notice every breath. You need to distract yourself enough to forget about your breathing. I came to this realization today. Stay busy, keep your mind going and don't think about breathing! That's almost impossible to do right now, but try focusing on a different part of your body instead!"
Anxiety,fkrw9c7,t3_fkayil,1584477294.0,"OMG yes. It feels like I don't get a full breath unless I sigh deeply, and that's not common. It gets worse at night when I lay down. My fiance bought a pulse/ox monitor and my o2 levels are good, my lungs sound good, my heart sounds good. If I focus on something intently, it helps a lot. Even though it's weird, I listen to ASMR to help go to sleep."
Anxiety,fkrts4a,t3_fkbuys,1584475878.0,"Yes. Back of head tingles, heart beats fast, palms sweat, and can't breathe. I have thought I was going to die every night for the past week."
Anxiety,fkrtcnp,t3_fkblzt,1584475633.0,"I fully understand. Go get help as soon as you can. This is my big problem, every time I think of the future (my eventual death) it almost certainly leads to an anxiety attack. I too have hypochondria. The thing is, symptoms of GAD match a lot of other symptoms. You then focus on those symptoms constantly, have a anxiety/panic attack, which then create more symptom for you to focus on just to do it all over again. It's a vicious cycle that I'm currently trying to get out of myself. I've been in damn near a constant anxiety attack for right at a week, and have had peaks all out panic attacks. It got to the point of me nearly having suicidal thoughts, despite my absolute fear of death. I went to the doctor yesterday and got prescribed 10 mg of Lexapro. There are some side effects I'm still dealing with as this has obviously not been in my system long enough to alter my brain completely, but it has definitely helped a little. I expect it will be a big difference by the end of this week. Today has been the best day I've had in a week, and this morning was still rocky. Be tough, endure, get help. You will be just fine. I know those words don't mean much, but that's all I can say unfortunately. Take care of yourself, and I hope you find relief."

Anxiety,fkijq4v,t1_fkiieca,1584221635.0,"Will do, I was also told to have thyroid checked."
Anxiety,fkiit68,t1_fkiih9k,1584221009.0,Thank you
