socialanxiety,fqpdn1r,t3_gk46u8,1589543538.0,"Hey! I hate that too. Thoughts can be true and I feel like cbt really neglects that. How can you be expected to move on if you know something is accurate and you‚Äôre being told it‚Äôs not? If you‚Äôre getting a negative impression with your therapist then it could be helpful to think about other options. Obviously I don‚Äôt know the entire situation and maybe there‚Äôs something good about it too. But as someone who‚Äôs been to a bunch of different therapists I feel like it‚Äôs most important to find someone you‚Äôre compatible with. Sometimes it takes work but you can definitely find a therapist where when you leave you genuinely feel good! 

Analyzing and challenging thoughts is important to work on for sure, but anxiety can be such a body habit that cbt strategies can be relatively meaningless in the moment. Maybe try relaxation strategies like breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, and then do something that makes you feel good when you can. It may halt the thoughts a bit. But try different things because it‚Äôs ultimately about what works for you."
socialanxiety,fqpcofq,t3_gk2qyr,1589542718.0,"Yes! You‚Äôre not alone. I watch myself in slow motion say and do things that don‚Äôt remotely match what I‚Äôm thinking. Or I blank entirely. Breathing often helps. When we‚Äôre anxious we breathe very shallowly, and the deprivation of oxygen to the brain is one of the reasons it‚Äôs hard to think/ remember things when you‚Äôre anxious."
socialanxiety,fqij4zx,t3_git76d,1589396688.0,"Yeah, I agree with this too. I don't think exposure is helpful unless it's facilitated in a particular way (having a therapist guide you through everything). I think that sometimes addressing anxiety in general can be helpful. Like what can you do to reduce anxiety in the moment? Breathing, progressive muscle relaxation. Then try to challenge your thinking afterwards, and affirm something positive or do something that makes you feel good.  


I think its incredibly hard to address the thoughts in the moment as things are happening, and that a lot of the work can probably be done outside of social situations to challenge how you process things. This is obviously a lot of work, and I wish there was something easier :(."
socialanxiety,fqih6ss,t3_gj4dck,1589395950.0,"Yes, definitely. I'm sorry that this is happening, it's definitely not easy. This is why I always dislike when people will say things like ""you just need more exposure"" or that the worries are irrational, and that the likelihood of other outcomes are possible. Sometimes just being predisposed to experiencing anxiety on a body level makes it so things are more challenging.  


As for coping mechanisms sometimes if I focus on the words only I am better able to integrate into the conversation and anxiety can take a back seat and reduce the likelihood of a self-fulfilling experience. I feel like it can be habit though, so it's really hard."
ptsd,f9uqo80,t1_f9snebw,1575655963.0,That‚Äôs a really great attitude.

ptsd,f9smz9i,t1_f9sjy05,1575595683.0,Yeah I don‚Äôt blame you. It doesn‚Äôt help that a lot of people automatically think violence/outbursts in association with PTSD. I think there needs to be more awareness of just normal symptoms.
ptsd,f9sjsxh,t1_f9neey8,1575593835.0,Yeah I relate to this a lot. I find disclosing doesn‚Äôt always help. It‚Äôs really challenging.

ptsd,f9lmkax,t3_e0q2p1,1575426725.0,"Yeah, the way people use the word in a popular way trivializes our experiences with PTSD, as though being triggered = offence. It‚Äôs a physiological response."
depression,f7tglec,t1_f7p6bdy,1574004163.0,"Honestly, we would be friends. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal at all to be awkward. It‚Äôs so strange to think that awkwardness is such a social violation, and I think it‚Äôs because people are afraid to admit to themselves when they are nervous. If someone can‚Äôt provide support for someone else it usually means that they haven‚Äôt addressed it themselves."
depression,f7sny3r,t1_f7sae1o,1573996665.0,"I think it's good that you understand that people don't necessarily see whats happening (re: mental health). That really speaks to your maturity.   


I don't mean to say this as a solution or anything, because I know things are complex and sometimes you just want someone to talk to. But one thing I heard that \*clicked\* for me was, ""When you're having mental health problems -- don't individualize it. Yes, we want to empower people, but don't individualize the problem."" A lot of the times the reasons we are depressed are not because of personal failures.  
I'm 31 and I recently read that it's common for people in our age cohort to be in situations where it takes them longer to enter the workforce, so as a result many more people are living with their parents for longer, and staying in school longer. If this is happening to so many people, it can't possibly be a personal failing. People have linked it to the financial collapse of the 2000s, and the changing nature of work that sees people in many temporary positions.   
Being depressed is no fun way either way though. \*hugs\*"

socialanxiety,f1hyf4i,t3_d8itfw,1569503017.0,Yeah ^ that‚Äôs a really good suggestion. If your therapist knows that impacted you it will be helpful for both of you.
socialanxiety,f1hunar,t3_d9bmiv,1569501181.0,"You‚Äôre awesome for coming here to ask! 

I guess it depends on him, but just listening to him when he has a hard time and exercising patience. He may be sensitive to your responses too, which doesn‚Äôt mean you ought to self censor, but just keep it in mind that it‚Äôs the disorder and not who HE is as a human being. Exercise your own self care by gently setting up boundaries. Being patient and consistent in your listening is really helpful in my opinion."
socialanxiety,f1htzoy,t3_d98wfo,1569500863.0,"Yeah, I feel the OP so much. 

It‚Äôs interesting because for the first time there‚Äôs a language for this because we can talk about things like social anxiety, but that doesn‚Äôt mean most people are close to understanding it. I think that since we‚Äôre just starting to talk about it it leads to a lot of misunderstanding because it‚Äôs so nuanced and simplifying it is easy. On one hand it‚Äôs like yes everyone deals with anxiety, but no not everyone‚Äôs experiences are the same. 

It‚Äôs super frustrating too when people think social anxiety is being afraid of people. I don‚Äôt know about other posters here, but honestly I‚Äôm not afraid of people at all, but the feelings of anxiety are chronic and part of my body experience. The reasons for any type of anxiety are so varied and complex and often rooted in some form of trauma or negative life experiences. The way people respond makes a difference, but at the same time getting frustrated because of people not understanding isn‚Äôt helpful either. That‚Äôs all to say...it‚Äôs incredibly hard and sometimes it feels like there‚Äôs no winning beyond talking to people who actually do understand."

Anxiety,f16uvtq,t3_d7z32t,1569224922.0,"Don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself! It‚Äôs hard for the brain to do more than one task well at a time. Anxiety can hijack your brain by no fault of your own. That sort of thing happens to me all of the time to be honest. I agree that most people don‚Äôt have the patience for it. That said, it doesn‚Äôt mean anything is wrong with you. I relate to the frustration you describe *hugs*"
Anxiety,f16ukft,t3_d7ys0v,1569224554.0,"Yeah, maybe trying a different therapist would be a way of telling if it‚Äôs the therapists approach or if it‚Äôs how you‚Äôre responding. Maybe you‚Äôre working through something and the therapists support would be beneficial? But I guess one way to tell is how safe you feel around your therapist. Do you feel like you can talk to them?

If it‚Äôs not the specific therapist or their approach (maybe it takes time to figure that out) I‚Äôd personally say to listen and honour yourself. While I think therapy can be super necessary - I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs helpful in all cases depending on circumstances. It can be something better approached at a different time."

taijiquan,f0xqppj,t3_crri20,1569042386.0,"A bit late here, but You Tube videos were okay for myself to just get acquainted with Tai Chi. (I‚Äôm still new) See if you can follow along for any period of time to see if it‚Äôs something you will stick with since you mention you are on a budget. If you stick with it then I would also recommend eventually saving to work with a teacher because form is such an essential component of the practice. You can somewhat learn from videos, but because your body will be different from whoever you will watching I personally think there is more benefit in getting in-person instruction. I‚Äôd try to see if there are Taoist centres or community centres that offer classes at a lower rate.

Tbh though I think if you‚Äôre just starting yt videos certainly won‚Äôt harm you at all, and it could even be a good base to eventually enrich any classes you take.

Video rec: Tai Chi for Beginners by Dr.Hoover or the couple that Ian Sinclair has done. Both teachers have a strong understanding of the principles while making it easy for a beginner to understand.

All the best!"

Supporting another person is really admirable and helpful. It may be helpful to remember that if you‚Äôre taking care of yourself you can better take care of others.

In the mean time are you able to spend time together at all? Maybe you and your dads girlfriend can plan to do some things he enjoys together, and maybe see if he opens up.

socialanxiety,eus3nom,t3_chdjsu,1564002811.0,"I wish I had a better more insightful answer but preparation helps and focusing on something specific about the work rather than your colleagues.

This cycle is automatic at this point and stopping it takes a force of strong will. Going through 38392026 possible outcomes and possible potentials. It‚Äôs exhausting. CBT doesn‚Äôt work for me as it complicates this process further. Action based things that literally disjoin the thinking help but 90% of the time aren‚Äôt an option when you‚Äôre tied to a clock at least 8 hrs a day. Mindfulness is something helpful to practise and strengthen for sure."
