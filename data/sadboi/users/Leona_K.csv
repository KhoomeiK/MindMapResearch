Dogtraining,fhienq2,t3_f3fehv,1581623265.0,"Btw those are just on her paws and belly and nowhere else. No hair loss or change in behavior. She had tapeworms but she was treated for that and the vet said that she's 'clean' from worms now. 

She had her 1st set of shots at 2 months old and will get her 2nd round next week. I have older (Samoyed) dog and she doesn't have that even though they are in contact every day ALL the time, so I guess it's not contagious. She doesn't have fleas or ticks, I bathe her every 2 weeks because she likes to get herself into everything dirty, her hair seems normal, clean and fluffy. 

J sleep with my dogs so I'm a little worried of what this might be cuz I don't want to get infected with that."

*Anorexia:* food=fear/guilt. You LOVE food but you can't eat and you count every single calorie. Your body is screaming because you've starved for days but that pain in your empty stomach makes you proud. You look yourself in mirror and smile when you see bones, pale skin, thigh gap but when you don't notice any weight lose you spit in mirror and starve more and more until it makes you smile. You feel weak, sleepy but you don't want to sleep because you feel dirty and like you haven't burned enough calories. You exercise until your ankles hurt and you muscles are sore... Unless you've lost most of your muscles and you can't even exercise anymore. You avoid events, people, you just want to be home, exercise, distract yourself from food and starve and then eat as little as possible usually always the same exact food. [For example I ate only specific brand of oat [10g] with 150 ml almond milk and 2 strawberries a day, every day] I would lose up to 1 kg/ 5 lbs a day and I weighed myself every morning. I was eventually hospitalized for 2 months because I was so skinny I wasn't even able to walk. 


*Bulimia:* This came after I recovered from anorexia. I would binge and eat until I felt sick and then felt the need to get rid of all this food so I did. I would throw up until I felt empty and dizzy. This would happen every single night. I came to my apartment after collage them binged, threw up, shower, sleep. Repeat. I enjoyed while I was binging but also I felt to guilty I would cry myself to sleep and begged myself to stop this hell... And eventually I did when I fainted in public and ended up in hospital.
