like Detroit, Porsche & an Nissan GTR.

MODDING:

To anyone who modded pre-0.0.0.5 patch.

You'll most likely get FATAL ERROR when launching the new update.
Key is to unpatch the EZPZ patch, just like we did for patch 0.0.0.3. If that still fails, Backup/Delete the game files and install fresh.
If the EZPZ Patch is not working:
Uninstalling the game and also manually delete local files seems to be the solution (for those who don't have mods installed)
To do so, Hit Win+R, paste %userprofile%AppDataLocal and backup/delete the SessionGame folder.
Then, in the STEAM installation folder, backup/delete your Session folder under
...Steamsteamappscommon
Then reinstall the game."
