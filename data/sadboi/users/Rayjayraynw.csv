The mages took the horns, and Erin used her connections and got the strongest people she could to help her and fought with them. Xif used a powerful and legal skill on her, her hands were tied. She rejected most of Xrns requests out of hand but accepted some of them because she wants to raise up the antinium. She was upset with magnolia because she ambushed her with two equally powerful ladies who worked together to overpower everyone in their way and brought the antinium to the brink of war because she's desperate to form an alliance with the drakes.... despite knowing that there's a god sleeping under rhir that the ants were forced to flee from.
