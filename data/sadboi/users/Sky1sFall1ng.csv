My words dont do its justice though. so I understand why people think im crazy for believing its real.

 Idk man, after that I started questioning my beliefs and everything. Im still not sure the truth about life and i'm sure I won't in this lifetime. But all I know is its interesting to be here even though I don't always feel that way."

It can be tough to when you're depressed because a lot of the times it can make u not wanna be around anyone. 

Everything takes up so much energy when depressed, and considering how little energy u have it can be tough. The best all you can do is let him know you're there for him, and listen to him if he needs it. But depression requires professional help honestly, and without that you can't really do a whole lot. and the mental health system is a whole different story.."
