Say the computer shows the readouts of all monitors on the floor on the screen in boxes titled with patient's room numbers. Is it possible that Mary's monitor switched outputs with a different room's monitor? Someone else going through this heart sequence would have their monitor say they were in Mary's room so it would appear as though it was happening to Mary. Does that make sense?
