TrueOffMyChest,fjj3kdz,t1_fjio45b,1583382394.0,"Sorry this ended up being really long but I needed to write it. You don't have to read it.

This is going to sound weird but I dislike the idea rapists are the ultimate evil, scum of the earth. It's actually really easy for things to go wrong, for someone to not understand what you were doing. I don't want more convictions I want people to look at themselves and change.

I have tried to explain to people who have raped or assaulted me what they did and how it made me feel. I'd avoid the word rape because it's not about that I just wanted them to understand I was distressed by what happened and I hoped they wouldn't want that to happen again with someone else. 

It was more important to them to establish ""I am not a rapist, I am not a bad person"" than to apologise (maybe they thought that would be an admission of guilt). So to find a way for that to be true they had to find a way to make it my fault so they could feel like they didn't do anything wrong.

I wish more people wanted a culture where we could talk about these things because people make mistakes all the time. That's why I like things like the Gillette ad. 

You may see it as a big finger pointing at you saying ""Now remember, you evil men, you are predisposed to hurting those around you, don't commit atrocities to other people"". I agree that would suck if that was the message but I don't think it is. I think it's addressing a big problem in our culture. 

And I will chuck in at the end here: yes being falsely accused of rape is really damaging. People talk about it a lot. The problem is it usually starts with ""but what about"" when people are talking about rape victims which is really disrespectful. So feminists are so used to hearing it that they have a huge knee jerk reaction.

""Believe her"" (should be believe them) doesn't mean that's all the proof you need. It means if you are a friend, support them, if you work in law enforcement, take it seriously."
