All of that is just exhausting to worry about now. Yeah I'll play Mercy and I'll kick ass at it too.

I just want to reiterate how important it is to revoke internet access/Discord/anything that may get him in contact with his friends until he has learned his lesson, which is evident he has not. Especially during these times where he can't just go to school and continue this behavior. I can almost bet his behavior is not only learned from his friends, but encouraged. Discord with his friends is creating an echo chamber where these things are okay to say and any attempts to teach him that is absolutely inappropriate will be nill if he still can continue that behavior with his friends behind your back.

Also, and I don't mean this as a dig at your parenting(I am not a parent nor planning on it) but when I was growing up (currently 25) everything I did on the internet was my parents business. It was the stipulation that I could play WoW online and talk to friends, but they had every right to read everything I was saying to my friends at any point, with or without a reason. There was no such thing as ""privacy"" online until I was around 16 and they could trust me/knew I could handle the internet maturely. I guess things have changed over the past 10\~ years, but I think this situation should be a reason to reevaluate if he should have privacy of his chat logs if this is how he uses them."

At that point most of the nails if not all are long again and worth bringing back into the clinic to get another trim. Cats usually don't like their paws touched much less nail trims so definitely agree it's a good idea to bring to the vet for the first few times. They can show you how it's done and what to look out for. 

I also highly recommend getting multiple scratching posts or boards to put around your house if you don't already, as in between nail trims they will scratch and shed layers of nail and dull them themselves."
