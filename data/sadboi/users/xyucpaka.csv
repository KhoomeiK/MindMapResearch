Но и с другой стороны, практиковать английский никогда не повредит:) Рад видеть русскоговорящих! Надеюсь, у тебя дела отлично."
Schizotypal,flu6sc2,t3_fm8697,1585496460.0,"I’m probably really stupid, but I came to realisation that this whole virus situation might be the reason of my severe dissociation only after I saw this post. I stopped feeling anything after my college was shut down because of quarantine and shit got serious, now there’s only complete detachment and a feeling of watching the world on a TV screen. It’s like my house is floating in an empty space, distant from reality and it’s so surreal when I’m out to, huh, get supplies. 
 I understand you. Pretty sure a lot of us who dissociate feel that way now. Does reading the news that often trigger you to dissociate even more? I’ve been trying to avoid it, but it seems like for me it creates an even worse sense of surreal isolation."
