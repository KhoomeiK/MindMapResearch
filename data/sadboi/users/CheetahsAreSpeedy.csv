confessions,fhf6hnx,t3_f2mbiw,1581537205.0,"It kinda gets worse and worse the more time goes by. I broke and dislocated my wrist playing football. I was running toward the goal, and there was this huge guy defending, and right on the goal line, he kinda fell on top of me, and my hand landed on the metal bar holding the goal down at the bottom and back of the goal, and the guy landed on arm, so it got pulled out of its socket and also the bone cracked. At first I didn‚Äôt know anything was wrong, and I actually pushed myself up on my broken hand. Then I looked at it and realised I could see the outline of my bone wayyy out of place. I knew instantly it was at least dislocated. Everyone playing stopped and kinda just looked at it, and some people ran and got cars and a makeshift bandage etc. Then I got taken to the ER, and when they took off the bandage at the hospital, my arm was burning like crazy, and when I looked at it, I almost fainted because it had swelled up and warped into this really strange shape(kinda like Harry Potter‚Äôs arm after it got that spell put on it by Lockhart). Yeah...pretty interesting."
