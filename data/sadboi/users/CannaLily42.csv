But I've come up with a solution that works for me. I don't eat at all for several hours. At first you feel hungry. Then you get energy from not eating! Yes, we get sluggish after eating a big meal. Go out for walks in nature, explore. I don't measure time or speed, I just enjoy. 
Idk why I must eat in front of tv. But I must. So I stay away from tv. I try to keep my hands busy. I knit. I draw. I write. Read a book.Any other ""activity"" but eating. Eating is a stupid hobby but it makes us feel good!
I also don't keep loads of food at home. I keep proteins and fruit. Leave your cupboards empty. Carbs, get rid of them.
Food is an addiction! It's easier to get away from cigarettes because you quit completely while food must be kept at home.
Sugar is the most horrible additive in foods, ever. They add extra to sauces, breads, anything because sugar makes us spend our money and buy more, more, more! Stay away from sugar. It kills! 
I wish you the best of luck. Keep a diary. Walk every day. Dig in the garden. Fast a few hours."

It might be difficult for her to socialize. She might need the presence of just one person, a cup of tea. If this person could come once a week, she might start looking forward to the next time. That brings hope. But it should be understood that nothing is expected of her, such as cooking for guests, until she finds strength. 

The guest could bring her one gift from nature; a rock, a leaf, a flower. 

Most of all, though, I really think she needs a doctor. I've been depressed and meds help. 

Best of luck."
