relationship_advice,fp1xozu,t3_gauwuh,1588250609.0,Tell her you are not ready. It's a huge decision to have a kid. High schoolers get baby fever just like adults do. But does that mean you're truly ready to provide for a child? Not always. Financially it will be extremely tough and can potentially set you back on achieving goals such as education.

I smoke marijuana everyday as much as I want and I'm on lamictal. I've never had a problem mixing the two. Lamictal is considered one of the safer drugs for bipolar. But you do have to be extremely diligent in taking it everyday because Steven Johnson's Syndrome is terrible to get. It's very rare to get SJS. Like all drugs, you could have a terrible reaction to anything.

The drug has helped very well for me."
