Whenever someone says victim wavelength/mentality 9/10 they’re being judgmental (unintentionally or not) and it does nothing to actually help the person, it’s just shaming (partial shaming is still apart of that too).

Victims already have enough shame on their own being that it comes with the territory of being abused, and don’t need people who claim to be helping adding onto that. 

I have cptsd and was also raised by narcs and I find that I attracted a lot of cluster b personality types as well. Personally where I’m at in my journey of healing & self discovery I refuse to participate in anything that might have a hidden agenda of victim shaming/blaming."

And yeah I agree. I find that the more conventional someone is the harder it is for them to understand. When I tell them that no I wasn’t dropped off and left at a doorstep or that my parents are still alive they get really confused lol. People with that mindset think if your parents are still around then they must love you but that’s the farthest thing from the truth. They don’t realize someone can still be around and “give up on you”, and that “giving up” can manifest in a lot of different ways. I think it stems from believing that every parent has unconditional love for their child and they can’t fathom in their heads any scenario where that doesn’t apply. It’s dangerous because it makes victims of abuse feel more outcasted, even if it’s not intentional. Dialogue is what keeps us connected.  It seems when individuals become so confident they have the answers to another persons suffering, humanity is lost.
