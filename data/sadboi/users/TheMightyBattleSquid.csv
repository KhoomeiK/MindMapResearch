Edit: Upon further reflection I take back what I said about the hawk, it's got MORE than two drawbacks! 

If you want to keep up in the lands race you have to:

1. Play a creature with smaller stats than your average 2 drop.

2. Wait for it to get over summoning sickness.

3. Get an attack in through any flyers or reaching creatures.

4. Get damage in.

5. Have fewer lands than the person you attacked, not just any player.

For example, with Umori The Collector you could build a creature-centric deck with Nikya of the old ways in gruul+, Uro Titan of Nature's Wrath simic+, Temur using both, etc. and you didn't need to go chase cards like you would with say a mutate deck but you're going for more of a good stuff approach.

LeagueOfMemes,fqvhuzf,t1_fqun8ls,1589677597.0,"Don't worry, riot doesn't either apparently because we got 3 different versions of what happened in a short amount of time (the comic, the lore page, and the cinematic)."
LeagueOfMemes,fqvhepx,t1_fqv7g2h,1589677318.0,"Also, the void isn't even that anymore. Kai'sa survived just fine by getting buddy buddy with a void creature... SOMEHOW.

Kassadin, Jax, malzahar, etc. survived contact just fine. 

The void is basically the universe trying to understand itself and Vel'Koz is the latest manifestation of that. All of the beginning void creatures like Kog'maw and Cho'gath just broke down what they ate but Kha'zix and Vel'koz learn from the things they assimilate and supposedly Vel'koz's knowledge is sent back to the main ""body"" of the void. The current issue is things on runeterra don't want to be assimilated but we don't know if ""the void"" can grasp that concept at some point and make a conscious decision to stop."
LeagueOfMemes,fqvgqlw,t1_fqvaarm,1589676913.0,"Uhhhhhhh someone hasn't kept up with the lore. Targon's a mess now too. It's no longer the days of Leona and Diana getting powers from just asking nicely. Targonians can now get forcibly possessed by gods even as young as Zoe was when she got turned. In Pantheons reworked reworked lore (yes I know I said that twice) he got fully murdered by ""The Pantheon, god of strength"" and that god was running around in his meat suit while characters like Leona who knew his old self looked on in horror. It wasn't until the new new lore that the human was randomly decided to be the one who won the spiritual battle but now you have a dead (?) god's spirit or whatever being used to juice up a human body similar to when Kayne kills Rhaast for his blue form.

The targonians also threatened to blow up Aurelion Sol's creations (aka THE FUCKING UNIVERSE) unless he let them shackle him to mount targon and force him to do what they want. Zoe then has the gall to treat him like a pet dog."
LeagueOfMemes,fqvfsw4,t1_fqv8zg3,1589676357.0,"Are you telling me anyone in noxus would be upstet or even surprised if your less gifted competitor killed you so they could be the ""best"" baker again?"
LeagueOfMemes,fqvfpd7,t1_fqvbhfe,1589676298.0,But if you have a handicap of some sort or even lack strength from being born on the smaller/weaker side that's exactly the same as being born weak and being forced to stay weak in noxus lol
LeagueOfMemes,fqvfdv0,t1_fqv79ub,1589676104.0,And he got tortured by noxians in new lore right?
mtgfinance,fqve2n0,t1_fqvad3d,1589675307.0,"Well even commander's quarters likes throwing in stuff that only works with his particular build, he just has fewer than I do. He likes keeping a template to stay budget a bit more."
EDH,fqv99wf,t1_fqv7j0x,1589672458.0,"Oh yeah, I mispoke. Add some cats if you want the heirloom blade shenanigans. [[Felidar Sovereign]] can be an alternate wincon. [[Leonin Warleader]], [[Lurrus of the Dream-Den]], and [[Regal Caracal]] are some good ones that can buff your numbers."

EDH,fqv8fc4,t1_fqv6en1,1589671974.0,I can definitely see that being a lot of fun. My oathbreaker deck was a big mana [[Estrid The Masked]] deck that revolved around land untap abilities and land enchants as most of my auras.
EDH,fqv53hr,t1_fqv42ok,1589670040.0,"To be more specific since I think you're misunderstanding, it was lab jace as the oathbreaker, that spell that exiles your lands as the signature spell, and the only non-land in the deck was a Sapphire Medallion."
EDH,fqv1bjp,t1_fqv061q,1589667892.0,Yeah but if you're bouncing your own boi there are a billion 1 drop spells you could use.
TIHI,fqv0fae,t1_fqutl6m,1589667391.0,"[Here you go](https://imgur.com/8FKvDQq). As per your instructions, I DM'd it to you but I replied so others could find out as well :P"
MemeEconomy,fquzr3n,t3_gknxzl,1589667036.0,It's like how facebook keeps hiding the activity log and groups behind more button clicks with every update. Lord knows why these companies think I want to click MORE to find what I want.
