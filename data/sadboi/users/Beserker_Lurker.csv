Also just when I THINK I'm over them, whether they were friends from 15 years ago or somebody I met just temporarily who I clicked with (but sabotaged anyway), I find myself stuck grieving their loss as if part of me died the very day we stopped talking.

Each time I started bonding with someone, I swore to myself that this time would be different, that I wouldn't let my fears hijack another opportunity for a relationship. Never worked in the end, I still got incredibly anxious, paranoid, and the more that person showed affection or good will, the more my insides wanted to constrict and I couldn't breathe. Pushing them away was the only way I could cope even though I deeply wanted that connection and still do. Wish I could give any advice but it's difficult to see a way forward."

19/20 my abandonment fears and unstable relationships really skyrocketed out of the blue.

I was eventually referred to a consultant who was the first person to actually listen and DISCUSS my issues and trauma. The experience was a light bulb moment. As far as psychiatrists go, unless you're verbal troublesome or physically dangerous to yourself and others, they don't give a shit what you say. I've had consistent issues with my current one and have had to make him rewrite reports because of how off the mark he was, repeatedly so. The man was smug as hell too."

BPD,flqexhb,t3_fqgai6,1585391884.0,"The way I've coped was to just distance myself from them and allow time to ride the emotions out. I'll go weeks avoiding them because even just the sight of them makes my blood boil (for no reason too). They've also said stuff that'd warrant confrontation like behave shitty or said stuff, but again I hate feeling that way so I end up removing myself from the situation entirely. We're definitely not as close as we used to be, but at least I can look in the mirror knowing I've not subjected them to the drama going on inside."

After my last flare up, I've become more isolated than ever and dialled back the amount I talk to my only current friend (who I honestly don't even know if I like half the time).

It makes me feel like a horrible person but I NEED to get away in order to maintain a shred of sanity. 

On the flip side, there have been a few occasions where this fear has made me double down and become TOO intense and co-dependent, ultimately forcing the other person to cut me off instead.
