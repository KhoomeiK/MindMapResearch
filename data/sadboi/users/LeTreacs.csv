Brexit is a great example, we voted for a guy to be in the eu Parliament who wanted to prove the EU Parliament was ineffective. So he deliberately made it worse to prove himself right! And now my countrymen have given up their rights to live and work in over 20 other countries.

Brexit used propaganda to steal working rights from my people and republicans have used it to keep healthcare rights away from yours

I 100% will keep my socialist healthcare, it is better in so many ways but you’ve been conditioned like Pavlov’s dogs to believe it will be bad. And you believe it’s bad because you’ve been told it’s bad, not because you can think for yourself. It’s sad.

As of 2020 I am vape free after 18 years of smoking/vaping, it is possible!

For me, the first full day of waking up and going to sleep without the vape was the hardest, but Day 3 to 4 is the roughest spot. 3 months in and you start to think about it in the context of “wow, I haven’t thought about vaping for a week!” - that’s a cool day.

The things I did differently the last time I’m going to quit was getting the quit vaping app and nicotine gum. The app is cool, it gives you a running clock since the last time you vaped and your longest time vape free (still helping me today if I feel the itch!)

I think the gum worked for me because I hate gum in general, I don’t want to chew it so I naturally gave it up.

Keep trying different things and I know you can quit! Only one method needs to work!!

If I got a hit for apologising then I I’d really not be sorry for what I did."

CasualUK,f0t0cla,t1_f0svd8r,1568913740.0,"I was weekend staff in a couple of stores in my teenage years and had some cool moments on the customer service desk with really nice people!

I once unpacked one of every type of kettle in stock for a blind gentleman so he could properly examine them and find one that he wanted.

I had another gentlemen looking for a guitar for his sons birthday, after opening it for him he tuned it in three seconds flat, busted out some awesome music and then decided to look somewhere else as the quality was too low for him.

You meet every kind of person working there"

I’m not American, I haven’t been following the case in the media. My opinion on this video is based on how the presenter frames his argument, he is clearly biased."
Frisson,f0burz9,t1_f0anftq,1568532090.0,"That is obviously not the case as if you find one article stating “man arrested on charges of [what he was charged with], after woman was found behind dumpster”, then your answer is clearly no as that is a statement of fact, as he was arrested on those charges and a woman was found.

The guy in this video is clearly writing a narrative that he thinks is true, he’s formed an opinion and is presenting information in a way to support his opinion by pushing particular aspects and downplaying others. It’s totally transparent.

I suggest you rewatch his video, with your apparently open mind, and ignore everything about the subject matter and pay attention to the narrators motive for making the video."

I was spotting for someone learning double backs and the coach would give a shout when to kick out and slow the rotation as it’s really disorientating when you first do a move. This kid had clearly been building to this move for a while so he will have a sense of how much power he needs and if he’s going to make it or not."
