AskReddit,fq54om4,t3_gg63my,1589092418.0,"High school, for sure. It was the roughest four years of my life. I've experienced things teenagers shouldn't have to experience. I was treated as if I wasn't a human being. School was the worst. I've had to endure emotional and even physical abuse from my peers. People who I thought were my 'friends' only used me for their benefit. Home wasn't safe either. I dealt with my deadbeat father, who would often beat, curse, and belittle my mother and me. As a result, my depression gradually spiraled out of control. During my junior year, I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. The expectations to succeed, my ever-mounting trauma, and abuse became too overwhelming. I would rather die than to continue suffering. Getting help for my mental health issues was difficult. From where I live, the stigma is awful. People would assume that I'm a psychotic murderer or deemed dangerous because I have a mental illness. I felt like I had to fend for myself because no one would help me.  I've never felt so isolated nor inadequate about myself."

uofmn,fp35b6l,t3_gaq3yh,1588273340.0,"For context, I'm a high school senior from Kansas. I chose to go to UMN TC because of the surrounding area, career prospects, and leadership. Honestly, I wanted to leave Kansas for a multitude of reasons. Most notably, I felt that there weren't enough opportunities to succeed and that it was backward at times. Being in Kansas was mainly dull and miserable. I was in a toxic environment at home and school for years. I needed an escape from the life I've always known. Yes, I am aware of how expensive it is for out-of-state students, but I don't mind. I'd rather be in debt at the U than to be miserable where I'm at currently. But, the U has an endless amount of opportunities to succeed, and I've met a great group of friends who are accepting.  The U really does invest in their students from what I saw. In my opinion, I think choosing the U is the best decision in my life."

When I reported it to the police, the detective in charge of my case invalidated it by saying, ""I've dealt with cases worse than yours."" Then he went on and acted like I was a nuisance to him. My ex was 18 and attended the same high school as me. He used his status against me. I was made to look like I was trying to sabotage his reputation. As a result, I dealt with severe bullying. I was called a whore, slut, and a sociopath. To this day, I deal with PTSD and depression from what happened to me.

So, I had to learn all the material on my own. College credit isn't guaranteed. If you know where you're going to attend college, make sure you check with them to see how the scores would transfer.
