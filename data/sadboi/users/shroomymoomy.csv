I understand the concept is to make driving more expensive and encourage use of bikes and public transportation, but that's not a reality everywhere. Not only that but I'm in northern AB, I already pay about $300 a month to heat my home in the winter, what does a tax on my NG accomplish other than making my life more expensive? I'm still going to heat my home, and I still dont have access to public transit to get to work.

My second problem is that, let's say for a second that the tax causes some well services company to decide ""hey, it's too expensive to operate in canada"" they arent going to shut down, they're going to move somewhere else. Dropping emissions here just to have then go up elsewhere is a zero sum game. At least if we keep businesses here we can take at least some business away from countries where it's okay to drop frac fluid and production fluid on the ground.

If they think they're depressed, they probably are, going to a doctor and explaining the symptoms will lead the doctor to say ""yep, you're depressed"". The only difference between medical diagnosis and self diagnosis is who said it, I never had any kind of tests. 

The problem with going to a GP is that mental health is not their wheel house, my first run on meds was disastrous and made everything much worse. If you're in a country with publicly funded healthcare like Canada, you can just ask a doctor for a referral to a psychiatrist who can more precisely prescribe meds. If not then I guess a GP is fine, but knowing that SSRI and SNRI arent the only class of antidepressants is good knowledge to have.

Alternatively, I used psylociben mushrooms (magic mushrooms) to treat my depression for years when the meds didint work. They worked wonders, there's a boatload of research by Johns Hopkins university and Harvard medical school, as well as many other universities supporting that they work very, very well for treating depression.

If the person is already in therapy then maybe talk to them about what their therapist has recommended during the downs, and if not then gently encourage them to seek help or help them set up an appointment somewhere.
