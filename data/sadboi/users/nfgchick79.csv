bipolar2,fr2irq7,t3_gm4v09,1589838013.0,Hm. Well I know I was REALLY angry and that started around 13 maybe? The depression started around then but got enormously bad between 14-23ish. My parents largely ignored my mental health issues. I could go on and on about the whys and what was happening in my life that could have triggered it. I've had PTSD also for a long time and really had no idea until around 5 years ago. My official BP2 diagnosis just happened about a year ago. Other doctors said it to me over the years but I basically told them they were full of shit. This was mostly because I had no knowledge of BP2 and only knew of BP1 and I knew I didn't have that. No one ever clarified for me the differences. I've had hypomania forever and I didn't know what it was. I'm so relieved now that I have the right providers and am getting towards the right meds. Oh and I'm 40 so I've suffered for quite some time.

I mean I am absolutely not shaming any men who get emotional for various things, but to act like women are somehow just SO emotional all the time about everything and men aren't is bananas. Also, people tend to forget that anger is an emotion. Please tell me this dude is not incredibly angry (at an internet stranger at that)?

I managed to get a mat and mini bands before everything went to shit. I never work out at home so this is pretty rough.

Edit: Reading comprehension. I saw you bought weights before all this. But if you know of anywhere still, I'd be happy to know, lol."

workingmoms,foahthy,t1_fo8rl4r,1587646769.0,"We've gotten a refund in the past. We've had the same bank account for 10 years. So, a little confused. Also the IRS site is still saying basically they don't know anything. We're definitely below the threshold for married, filing jointly."
workingmoms,fo8pw20,t1_fo8731m,1587601416.0,I completely understand. We owed money too for 2019 and have already filed and we've had the same bank account for a decade. And yeah they took our money immediately too.
workingmoms,fo84d6p,t1_fo7o31d,1587589680.0,The same fucking thing has happened to us. No stimulus. They just like forgot us I guess? And we're getting the same message on the IRS site as you. I'm so frustrated that I want to go outside and scream. Except it is so quiet I can't even scream because everyone in the neighborhood would hear me...where was I going with this? Fuck I'm so tired.
Invisalign,fo3zpwb,t1_fo27w14,1587495708.0,Same thing happened to me expect on my very last set of trays. I called my ortho yesterday and asked for help and they said the doctor would call me and he never did. <sigh> I can already feel them getting gummy. Worn them 3 weeks now.

AskWomenOver30,fnxdcks,t1_fnxcduu,1587336340.0,"Our neighborhood we chose is pretty middle class. We didn't have any children when we moved here. We weren't expecting to do daycare (loooong story), but when we toured them, they were all expensive. We also picked where we live for the wonderful school district as we were planning on having children. So it's a mixed bag. Great schools, more rich folks. Luckily the elementary school he is going to has a lot of kids from our neighborhood. Lots of down to earth people. Of course there will be upper class kiddos too but maybe there will be less pressure."
ptsd,fnx7517,t3_g4ee93,1587332799.0,"You're a good dad and you're doing all of the right things. I am so very sorry for your loss. I have PTSD and used to wake up like your son does. I needed something to help me sleep through the night. I'm no expert in meds for children but maybe also talk to his pediatrician or a psychiatrist that treats young people to get some additional advice. Obviously this isn't for everyone but I just wanted to put it out there. And I agree with the other poster, take some time for yourself to grieve too and maybe try some individual therapy. Sending you strength and an internet hug."
AskWomenOver30,fnx5vtr,t3_g4baxz,1587332090.0,"Yep. My son goes to a preschool (he's 5, almost Kindergarten) that is somewhat affluent. We live in a suburb that is mostly middle to upper class. We fall into the middle class somewhere. I started feeling uncomfortable when my son was invited to birthday parties at his friends' houses. I almost drove away from a party once because when we pulled up it was a mansion. They gave all the kids monogrammed water bottles as party favors. So every year for his birthday the last five years has been a struggle because its a ""keeping up with the Joneses"" type situation. We've become friendly with a couple of the families but I am still uncomfortable. We've never had a party at our house as I'm embarrassed. It's also at like a bouncy house place or something.My son doesn't quite get the differences yet but I'm concerned when it becomes more obvious. I'm certain his elementary school will be similar. I at least live in a development that is middle class and he has some friends here too (and so do we)."

TwoXChromosomes,fn7whea,t1_fn7gr32,1586729031.0,"I have an interesting story myself. My ex and I were college ""sweethearts."" We were together for 5 years before we got married. Divorced in a year and a half (that is a story for another time, lol. Bad scene). 

After that shit show, I met my current husband. We met, moved in together after 4 months, engaged at a bit over a year and married after being together 1.5 years. We are now happily married 8 years and been together almost 10. Oh and we have a 5 year old son that we adore. 

I'd rather say timelines don't really matter. I was divorced at 30 and thought everything was downhill. Well I'm in my 40's now and never been happier.

OP don't listen to your mom. Life happens. You're doing awesome! There's no expiration date on finding someone you love (or being single if that's what you would like, NOTHING is ""wrong"")."

Yah I'm not ""bored"" and I'd love to be able to go places too. DEFINITELY having some serious cabin fever. I hate this so much. But getting medicated at home is NOT getting old.

My coaches are doing some lives on Instagram which is way better. They do the demos and the timing. I much prefer that. The music on the at homes, does indeed suck. I mess up constantly timing myself. That being said, I am so so grateful to Orangetheory for doing this. Definitely not complaining though! Missing my studio so much <3"
AskWomenOver30,fn4fs91,t1_fn46vrv,1586640490.0,This right here. I agree with all of this. Husband cooked me dinner (pizza from scratch at that) the other night and it was a huge turn on.

I'm really short and even though I only gained 35 lbs, (I was about 145 when I gave birth), I got shitty comments all the time. Telling me how huge I was, asking if I was having twins etc. It's amazing how much ownership people think they have over women's bodies. I'm sorry people were so awful to you :("

Tell me about it. I spent...oh jeez, about 5 hours sewing masks over the weekend and a few more doing work work. Then I log in most nights too and do a bit of work. Thankfully my son is at an age where he can play ABC Mouse, or play games on his Kindle or do workbook sheets but jeezus it's hard. The only bright spot is my boss has little kids and so do a few others of us in the department. I know she's frazzled too. Doesn't make it okay, but at least she can relate."

Yep, we're in the exact same boat being essential. I'm so tired, I think I am going insane. AND our company didn't get our PPE (of course) so now they've asked for help making masks so I spent all weekend doing that. I'm going to be so burned out by the end of this month I'm going to just burst into flames!

I'm so sorry you are feeling the same way. Message me if you need to talk!"

I don't have enough. If someone in my family gets sick I'm fucked. I work in healthcare and I am corporate. I'm working so hard right now I want to scream. My husband is also working remote. Our VERY spirited 5 year old has been off the rails. This is just so hard mentally. All my regular projects on top of COVID all day every day is...mind boggling. I feel you mama. I really do.

He's been out of Pre-K, swimming lessons and gymnastics now for almost a month. Juggling all of this is insanity. I'm putting in WAY more hours during this than normal (nights and weekends). I can barely wash my hair let pick up a fucking hobby. I see these posts all the time and it just fills me with so much rage. I just fucking can't. My mental health is on a serious decline and I'm just trying to get through each day. In the original post,""You never lacked time, you lacked disciple."" Oh fuck that person so hard."
