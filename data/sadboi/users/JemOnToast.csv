When we're good, we're amazing, we gel, we have so much fun, he's loving and caring, he does a lot for me and I feel excited about a future. But when we row, even over something insignificant, it blows up and it's like a horrible comedown."

JustNoSO,fiqcds0,t1_fiq7v1y,1582641038.0,"I've suggested counselling, asked to go as a couple. We had separate counselling last year but it caused more issues than it solved, as his counsellor was saying one thing, and mine another. He said he doesn't want to go to counselling and feels I'm forcing him because I've bought it up a few times and said it's quite important to me to get a third perspective and help us. I'm starting to give up tbh"

AskReddit,finldfh,t1_fimz1xh,1582565436.0,"I hate situations like this and hate society for making me feel this way. I was at the train station at night recently and it was empty apart from one guy. I had headphones on but he gestured me and then asked me what time the train was due, despite the screen displaying it above us. I answered him, put my headphones back on and just avoided eye contact but kept an eye on him until the train came. I felt really rude but at the same time, a bit scared. Probably just an innocent guy wanting a chat, but I shut it down straight away."
childfree,fin9ymo,t3_f8qcem,1582559135.0,"I feel this. People seem to think that not having kids means I can travel loads AND have lots of spare time and cash. The reality is me living in a one bed flat, driving a 12 year old BMW and going on one or two holidays a year. Feels a bit disappointing, but I hear my neighbour sometimes who has a young kid and a newborn, I hear the noise, crying, her shouting, cartoons on the tv, and although I don't have much, I thank god for my peace and quiet!"
