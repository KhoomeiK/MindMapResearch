With the JUUL, you can taper off the nicotine levels which eases you into withdrawal. It satisfies the physical habit and cravings. Downside: they are addicting as health and harmful BUT helpful in the short term. 

Also using the non-smoking app has helped as it allows you to log your achievements. A visual representation of your success with not smoking is rewarding."

Her mentions (digs) at Natalie are so off hand and strewn in to a narrative that is clearly wrapped around her relationship to her father. Bless it. 

I have so many more comments on this I am seriously considering rewriting it in my spare time. Or perhaps writing my own article (donations welcome!!~). It’s just...there’s so many things...

Edit: WAIT! I can’t rewrite the “article” because that’s exactly what Natalie was doing for her as mentioned in the Cut article lmao. Also, Natalie totally mentions the sheets in there as being “stained” most readers would infer this as being sex or period; not sure why CC needs to clarify that part.

SmolBeanSnark,flkpvk8,t1_flk7rxw,1585245455.0,"Not exactly this IIRC but the tone, style, and overall writing is very similar to Cat’s in HTMYL. 

She is somewhat of a “stream of consciousness” writer and describes “doctor shopping” for pills multiple times in her book. Pretty big theme throughout the memoir. She describes how she obtains more pills and says things such as “It’s that easy! See!” speaking directly to the reader. 

I would not call plagiarism but would say this sounds GREATLY influenced by Cat’s writing. Would understand if she got a copy or has read these “leaked” excerpts and that is what has pushed Cat over the edge. Total ripoff of her writing style but I will give CC some credit as her older Instagram “work” did play with the narrator and reader in a similar fashion (could also be influenced by Cat’s older works though)."

moraldilemmas,fiowke7,t3_f8mwsq,1582592680.0,"Bad plan. 

In your post, you are explaining how her “reasons” for breaking up were incorrect, that that’s not what happened, etc. If you’re still stuck on this now, what do you think will happen if you engage in a relationship again? Will you just forget that she has issues with the time you spent with your friends? People don’t change that much. If she had issues then, she’ll have issues now. Unless you want to start up the endless cycle of “I’m right, you’re wrong”, I would not do it. 

Oh, and living with the constant fear of her dumping you again will not be fun."

Anticonsumption,fgmxmu0,t3_ez9cu8,1580933952.0,"Eh, Amazon requires vendors/distributors to “pre-package” most of their single items in plastic polybags before shipment. I’d guess that 60% of products available on Amazon arrive at their DC already in plastic (especially clothing items). This is done for convenience of order picking and processing. If you request no plastic (at all, not just packing bubbles) and they comply, they would most likely just take it out of a polybag and throw that bag away. Also, most packing bubbles come on large chains of plastic and then are filled with air before shipment. Doing what is suggested in this post would reduce personal disposal of plastic but the shitty thing is...this plastic already exists. I would say it would be better if an environment conscious consumer receives the plastic so they can dispose of it properly, rather than leaving it up to a warehouse employee who will just throw (possibly) recyclable plastic in the garbage. 

Source: I woke at a large consumer goods company that distributes a butt ton of products to Amazon and complies to their crazy (and wasteful) packaging demands."
