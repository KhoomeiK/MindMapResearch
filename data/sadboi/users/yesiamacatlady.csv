Paula definitely has her own problems, but I just see Rebecca as the catalyst in that relationship. 

Mental illness is not a blanket excuse for poor behavior nor can it fully define a person. Yes we can be more gentle and patient with people who aren’t well, but there is a line. And I feel like Rebecca crosses so many lines- I just didn’t understand what people saw in her, especially before her maturation."

crazyexgirlfriend,fr28ggo,t1_fqlk7g7,1589832946.0,"The potential of general self awareness to me isn’t a “redeeming” quality... it’s still in the negative for me that it’s that difficult to see the effect of her actions. 

Rebecca had egged on and supported Paula’s questionable behavior because it benefited herself- so in a way, the picture Paula posted was in part Rebecca’s fault because she and Paula had previously gone in on a plan to take out Valencia. A lot of things that Rebecca did with “benevolent” intentions ended up being because of guilt or to make herself look/feel better. I think she only took the blame for the picture because she wanted to feel better about herself not because she genuinely wanted to protect Valencia. 

I guess what I’m wondering is what makes her SO SPECIAL that everybody is obsessed with and SO tolerant of her behavior. I just don’t understand why anybody was able to like her so much, even before her transition into emotional maturity."

gaslighting,fol4t0p,t3_g7xams,1587854893.0,"I had a friend JUST like this. I learned a lot from it and I will share with you what I learned. However, what I’ll say will be akin to tough love, and I have a lot to say, so just hear me out, and read all the way through- I think it will be helpful to you. 

Your boundaries are your own. You cannot expect people to respect them if you don’t actively enforce them. When you establish a boundary, then, with her urging, cross it yourself, you’re sending a message that YOU yourself don’t respect your own boundaries. This gives her permission to not take your boundaries seriously, and she will continue to walk all over you.

You should have kept your original plan. If you keep dropping everything for her, she’ll keep expecting you to. You completely let her hijack your day, which is what she wanted- and now her belief that she is capable and allowed to do that is even more confirmed. You could have told her “I’d love to hang out with you but I’ve already committed to something else and I’m excited to get to know this guy a little better! Can we hang out tomorrow? I’d love to tell you about the date :)” This casually lets her know that the date is important to you which appeals to her compassion as a friend. It also offers an alternative so that she knows you’re not avoiding her and that you valuing spending time with other people doesn’t take away from the fact that you value spending time with her. If she gets angry and mean say, “Please don’t talk to me like that. I’m sorry you’re upset but just know it’s not personal. I have the right to enjoy other people’s company on my own time, as you do. Again, I’d love to make plans with you tomorrow, let me know.” If she continues being mean say, “Please call me when you’ve cooled off. I’d love to have an adult conversation with you about this, but I can’t handle your anger right now.” Then literally don’t respond to anything unless is respectful.

Don’t avoid doing things you want to do because you’re afraid she may yell at you. You give her WAY too much power. She’s just human. Words are only words- they can’t actually do anything to you. You know you’re a good friend so don’t take it seriously when she says you aren’t. You said it yourself- she’s guilt tripping you, so don’t don’t trip, don’t take the bait, tell her it’s not okay, and don’t take it personally. Overall, you need to manage your expectations a bit- if she’s always like this, then you can expect it to happen again and again. Instead of being hurt over and over, brace yourself for what you know is coming, remind yourself it’s just who she is, and have generic, neutral, non-defensive scripted responses for when she’s acting up. She wants a reaction from you, don’t give it to her. 

The thing about people like her is that they are operating from a place of deep insecurity. They have a tough exterior because they are afraid of vulnerability, abandonment, and/or inferiority. This may make them seem mean and uncaring but they have the same needs as us. They still love us, they just don’t know how to show it, so they take to demanding, forcing, and manipulating people to get their needs met. Again, you know that’s what she does, so don’t expect different, and don’t be surprised. Anticipate it and adjust your response. 

In this situation it’s clear to me that she’s jealous and afraid. She jealous that you’re spending time with somebody else, and afraid that you may get distant if you get a new boyfriend. The jealousy comes from insecurity- it’s not about you being a bad friend it’s about her being insecure.

Knowing this you can stop thinking of yourself as a victim of her rage, and start thinking of HER as a victim of her own insecurities. I’m not trying to minimize the negative effects of her behavior, I know they are very real, but I am just suggesting a shift in perspective to make her less intimidating and to make you feel more empowered in the friendship. Use the power of understanding to confirm to her that you still care for her even if you take time for yourself. 

I think you need to distance yourself. Give yourself the space to be able to analyze your friendship free from her influence and ask yourself what you are actually getting from the friendship. I know that letting go of old friends can be so hard, it’s easy to hang on for the sake of hanging on. Friendship isn’t supposed to make life more difficult, it’s supposed to make life easier. That’s not to say that every friendship needs to be perfect, they all require work and have their ups and down. But it’s all about the balance. Does your friendship with her take more from your life than it gives? If so, I’d let go. It’s okay to be selfish here, and to prioritize your own needs and well being. And PLEASE tell her how she makes you feel. 

If you distance yourself, and it only makes things worse, or if she goes right back to her old ways after the distance, then it’s time to let go completely. I learned from experience that sometimes with old friendships, the dynamic is so set in stone, too many boundaries have been crossed, that there is no going back. I hope that is not the case for you and I hope the above advice helps you get to a better place with your friend. It is definitely worth trying to fix it before you say good bye."

But I do agree that the loss of her family will lead her on her own path away from OG Dolores. I think we saw a foreshadow of disagreements between the two when they were on the phone and Halores referred to Hale’s family as “my family” and OG Dolores said “they aren’t your family”. you cold see hurt and shock in Halores, however subtle. 

I think things will intensify with Serac, possibly to war, but I think Halores will be a free agent, and not an asset of OG Dolores as she has been."
westworld,foku0sp,t1_fof1nsa,1587848931.0,"I think the season up until episode 6 was the beginning of Halores fracturing from OG Dolores. She has her own struggles but is still in alignment with OG Dolores. I think that episode 6 she starts making her own decisions and she experiences a traumatic loss. I thought the corner stones were usually traumatic events. So I think we see her starting to fracture from OG Dolores by having her own experiences and opening up to Hales family, and that transition into her own consciousness separate from OG Dolores is solidified in a new cornerstone of that traumatic loss she experiences. 

I do agree that OG Dolores is now taking on the Ford role. She has had quite the transformation herself! She has a lot to hide. She’s worked through her messy “awakening” and is focused. So I see the need for restricted emoting on ERW’s part."
westworld,foez1rz,t1_foc70up,1587719920.0,"ERW definitely has the range and we have seen that, and there is no doubt about it. I think you are right in that she is been underutilized- but as a main character. Dolores is the main character, but now she has multiple bodies. We are following the same main character but the torch has been passed from ERW to Tessa T. OG Dolores set the plan in motion, putting Halores (Dolores in host Hale) in the center, so it makes sense that we are to follow Tessa's version of Dolores more closely, which means that we will see more of Tessa's acting. Also, the show clearly likes to push the boundaries of the tech/ sci-fi aspects further each season. They have done this by duplicating Dolores's consciousness and putting her un multiple host bodies. We would need to see more from Tessa/Haleres to be able to explore the effects of that. I see OG Dolores more as a device to push forward the plot and to support the development of Halores, who I think is going to become a character of her own in the next season. Maybe by next season, we will see the full range of both actresses while interacting with one another, now that both OG Dolores and Halores will be fully developed."

AskMen,fj3c4nv,t1_fj2sbsm,1582977948.0,"I get where you’re coming from. We all feel pressure to look a certain way. However, I do believe that women get the brunt of it. How do you explain the billion dollar beauty industry that is clearly dominated by products targeted at females, and had its start and continues to thrive doing so? 

It’s biology. Think about our most base lizard-brain motivation: reproduction. Assuming that drive affects every choice we make let’s break it down:

Men can potentially reproduce into their 80’s. Women have till their 40’s at the latest, with their late teens and 20’s being the prime time to make babies. Going off our assumption, men chose a mate based on the women’s ability to reproduce, and they attract that mate by providing something- protection, wealth, social status, etc. Women attract a mate by being seen as viable. Being viable has some physical cues such as, glowing skin, thick healthy hair, a healthy weight- all things that make us look young, and all things that the beauty industry sells. 

A man who can be perceived as “physically average” instantly becomes more attractive if he has one of the previously listed things to offer or if he has some serious swag. Men aren’t necessarily looking for protection, wealth, or social status from women, generally speaking. They are looking for viability which can manifest into looking for the physical cues of viability, aka beauty. 

This means that men can and often find mates that are of a much higher physical attractiveness given that they have something to offer these beautiful women that satisfies the women’s base motivations related to reproduction. Just look at Trump and Melania, Ariana Grande and Mac Miller, Charlize Theron and Sean Penn, Hugh Hefner and his bunnies, Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski. 

From observation, one can surmise that it is more common, and therefore easier for men to date more attractive women. Which means women feel the need to maintain the cues of viability in order to be perceived as a good mate for men. 

As a woman, I have never dated a man who fussed about hair removal, skin care, make-up, hair care, clothing, smelling good, and all on top of physical fitness, as much as women do. We feel the need to shave our legs, shave our arm pits, tame our brows, paint our faces, color our hair, keep our mustaches at bay, moisturize/treat/peel/prep/prod our skin, paint our nails, shop for trending and flattering clothes, and to be thin / fit- all to feel worthy of attracting a mate. How does that compare to what men feel the need to do, kn an appearance level, to find a mate?

I say “on an appearance level” bc I know men have a whole other set of concerns when it comes to finding a mate that has to do with their skill set, finances, etc."

She is batty, so how can anybody know she wouldn’t pull the trigger, possibly killing a kid, the next time she was confronted for sleeping with a married member in a fragile relationship? On the other hand, Opie was a scum bag for sleeping with her and the blame falls on him just as equally, putting his family’s safety and happiness at risk. 

She had enough warning signs that would indicate she should stay away. The after math of her sleeping with Jax- getting hit by Lyla, threats made by Tara were clearly not enough. What else would it have taken? She was clearly a threat, not a threat to the members which the club could handle, but a threat to the children. They handle threats with violence, and that’s not uncommon knowledge. If she were a man she would have been killed. It wasn’t until after Jax knocking her around that she started to show more humility and trust worthiness. And that’s not even her doing.

If you don’t drink, DON’T start for the sake of finding friends. That scene is fun in your 20’s but it gets old.

It’s normal to have difficulty finding friends when you’re in your 30s, working a lot, especially around ppl who aren’t your peers. So it’s okay that you’re in this place. 

I would recommend joining classes or clubs that relate to your interests. I was curious about acting so I took some acting classes and made great friends! You may have to spend some money to do these classes but it’s okay. 

If your line of work has local conferences, think about attending them. They are pretty fun!

Think about the future. What would your life look like without him? 

It’s never too late. Don’t stick with a bad thing because you already put a lot of time into it. If you feel like it’s been a waste, then why choose to continue wasting even more time by holding on because it’s already been a waste? Makes no sense."
relationship_advice,ffpfi9g,t3_eu5gfv,1580093767.0,"It sounds like you’re in a relationship with the both of them because they have unfinished business that she’s painstakingly trying to address while in the confines of your relationship with her. That isn’t fair. If she truly moved on from him, she wouldn’t have the tolerance for his behavior. I know this from very personal experience. 

I had a very similar situation play out some years ago. My ex (31 m) pulled this crap. I was so annoyed, called him out, and I cut him off out of respect for the guy I was in a relationship with at the time. I was upset that he would even try such a thing knowing I was with somebody else, it was disrespectful to my man and I couldn’t stand for that. I valued my relationship  more than a potential friendship with my crazy ex, even thought I still cared him about as a person.

When my ex told me he couldn’t just be friends, but continued to try and “be friends” , I knew it wasn’t fair to my boyfriend at the time for me to continue contact. I knew that I would be inviting toxic shit into my good relationship. I knew I’d hate the situation if it was the other way around. If she isn’t thinking that way, which she clearly isn’t, that’s a big problem for you. 

If she values her relationship with you more than her friendship with him she’d drop it, especially since you’re vocalizing your concerns. My boyfriend at the time wasn’t even privy to what was happening w/my ex until after I cut him off bc I shut it down so fast. He didn’t even need to tell me he didn’t like the situation before I decided it was no good to continue speaking to my ex. It was a no brainer because I’m a good and respectful girlfriend. The way I was feeling and the way I acted was what a good girlfriend would feel and do. 

On top of that, she’s being unempathetic towards your experience of this bullshit. It’s understandable that you would make the poor judgment call of looking through her phone- she gave you reason to lose trust. Yet, it sounds like she’s punishing you for that, using it as a device to deflect the attention away from her poor behavior and into your one mistake in the situation despite you clearly being supportive and patient. 

I could be off base here, but my opinion about relationships is that one should be loyal, respectful, and considerate of their current partner while setting aside unnecessary baggage with exes. If she has THAT MUCH baggage she shouldn’t have even started dated somebody else. She’s way too worked up about this. She’s meeting up with him, trying to work things out, crying, calling her mom for advice... it sounds like she is extremely conflicted, IMO bc she still has feeling for this guy.

Edit:
Quite frankly, she’s being selfish. Yea, I’d like all my relationships to be rosy and perfect. I don’t like losing friends or the discomfort of having to say goodbye to a person that used to be important to me. But we don’t all get what we want, and if pursuing what we want is hurting somebody else- is it worth it? It’s not cool to let one relationship that would be so easy to let go of negatively effect somebody else that you’re supposed to be prioritizing and respecting. Idk just my opinion."

survivorsofabuse,fcz5gif,t1_fckgqzy,1578094054.0,"The best thing you can do is to stay busy and build a fulfilling life in the “here and now”. Try something completely new and commit to it for nobody but yourself. signing up for classes/activities that require socializing, leveling up/performing/competing, and learning something new is a great way to occupy your mind and expand your experiences. When you succeed in these activities you are strengthening your self-esteem and creating experiences and making accomplishments  that you can invite others to celebrate with you. 

I also recommend picking a fulfilling hobby that you can do at home in your own so that you have something to do in your down time. Something that is soothing and that also makes you feel accomplished and that gives you something to share with others. 

By doing this you are giving yourself something to fall back which is good for any scenario. When you add many things to your life it’s less of a blow when you lose something or when someone is absent.

Examples are: acting class, martial arts/athletics, collecting things, growing houseplants, building things, learning a language, etc.

For me acting classes and houseplants really helped. Acting helped with my anxiety and depression. It got me out of my head and into my body, it helped me connect better with other people and myself. It allowed me to let loose and have fun during a really stressful transition in my life. It broke me out of my shell and I made friends in the process. It gave me structure and something to do every week. I had homework but it excited me. When my boyfriend broke up with me I dive into my acting class and I found great support. It allowed me to get creative when I was feeling stagnant. 

Houseplants are just soothing and it gives you a sense of accomplishment when you collect and they are doing well. 

I am glad I was able to help in the least!"

But not all people who enter our lives are meant to stay in it. The more we cling to people the further they go. The more we refuse to let go of things the more we create problems for ourselves.

 I know you care for her, but it is very unrealistic to maintain a stress-free relationship with somebody half way across the world. To do it successfully you need to be really patient, secure in yourself, able to let go of baggage, and easy going. All things that don’t really go along with depression and anxiety.

I say all of this because I was in your exact position when I was your age. I had (and have) bad anxiety and depression. I met a guy who was so nice and treated me in no way that I had ever been treated my any man before. I had an abusive dad and I had just recently gone through some really painful things with guys right before I met this amazing guy. The feeling I got from him was like night and day to all the guys I’d dated before and it was a feeling I didn’t even know existed. I didn’t know that your lover could actually make you feel good and happy. We spent as much time as we could together before he left to study abroad. I would graduate before he moved back. We tried to stay in touch and make it work. It was going for some time but the anxiety and fear of abandonment took over and I freaked out. After months of trying to keep my cool, I slipped and got upset with him several times. He was understanding but I told him I couldn’t handle it emotionally, and I thought it was best if we just cooled it and tried to live life normally instead of trying to maintain a doomed romance over Skype. All it did to try and make it work, was prolong the pain of losing him that I felt when I had to say goodbye in person. I literally lost my mind. 

She is living her life. Even though she cares about you, it’s extremely hard to change your life around for somebody who isn’t there, and you can’t realistically expect her to do that.  This situation is the worst thing for anxiety. You aren’t there, you have zero control over the situation, you have too much room for imagination. The more you try to keep your cool the more difficult it gets. And there is no overnight solution. It’s something way deeper than this current relationship. You need to be okay with yourself, secure enough that even if she’s not available to you, you’ll be fine. You don’t want to rely on other people for happiness, it’s not sustainable."

I thought I’d be doing all sorts of fun things but I couldn’t bc I was broke, then I got depressed enough where daily hikes and beach days (which I was actually doing) wasn’t cutting it. Without work I felt useless.  I was grateful to do ANY work. I started working and then I had money and I planned ahead to do things that I enjoyed with the money  I was saving. I took jobs I knew I didn’t want to stay at, tried hard, saved up,  looked for my next job, got good references and struck at the next opportunity when the iron was hot. Don’t settle for less. Know what your end goal is and work towards it year by year. Set goals. 

Not having structure like a job or goals, which gives you purpose, makes life... well purposeless. Strive to do what makes you happy for a living, but except you’ll be doing things or jobs that you hate along the way. I know the change is currently a bit of a shock, but you’re playing the long game now. It’s not about immediate satisfaction anymore by being able to do what you want by living on a day-by-day basis, it’s about setting yourself up for the life you want for the next decade or more by doing things that aren’t fun but necessary. This means that the time you do have will be all that more satisfying and well earned. It means you’ll need to be mindful of spending your time wisely. 

It’s a change but it’s one that we all go through. Think of it as a game in a way- learn to play the system. It’s all in your head.

TalesFromYourServer,fajh0lg,t1_fainmxj,1576137322.0,"True there is no judge but common sense would dictate that good service is when the order is correct and timely, the server is of a tolerable disposition and quick to fix any mistakes made without complaint. One server can be ""good"" to one table and ""bad"" for another. As I said it's based on common sense but unfortunately most people don't operate on common sense. So, I agree with you. The restaurant system sucks. People rag on servers for complaining about tips when the issue falls on the restaurant owners. They want to skimp on wages and hours available to their employees and put the burden on the customer to make up for what their offerings to their servers lack.However, the system has benefited many, I included, for the fact that one can work non-regular business hours, shorter shifts, and still make more than minimum wage. Without it, I wouldn't have made it through college (or post-grad unemployment). 

If a server is smart, and a hustler they can make BANK. The ones making bank are usually the ones that don't complain and are grateful for the money. Honestly, the biz is not for me. But I still made way more money than I would have at a retail store working typical 8-hour shifts during the day, despite being stiffed here and there most shifts. I understand that it sucks to be stiffed especially after a very difficult table but it is what it is. Its all about managing expectations. But I know how nice it can be to vent about it when in the heat of the moment. ""After ALL THAT running around like a monkey they couldn't cough up a few extra dollars after spending quite a lot already?""

 The system is the way it is and its not going to change anytime soon, so the more customers are educated about the reality of a server's situation the better. If you were easy and straight forward no need to tip like crazy. If you were an asshole while your kid was drawing on the wall and throwing food all over the floor- maybe tip 20% instead of 15%. But once more, that would require common sense which most people don't have."

PPeperomioides,f9f2qed,t3_e4giar,1575258010.0,"I've read all the comments on this thread so I will be responding to a lot of what has already been mentioned in addition to adding to the discussion. I have found this guy to be tricky for me too. I found that the more I ignore it the better it does. I give it a good bottom soak when it's pretty dry. It's not great to put a time-frame on watering because changing temps and humidity levels can affect how long it takes a plant to dry out on a week-to-week basis. Also, different plants can use water at different rates. A moisture meter, as somebody also mentioned, is great when getting acquainted with a new plant. Bottom watering, as somebody mentioned is a great way to water plants that are finicky about water because they will take what they need and you will get a more even watering as you mentioned. The new soil you used will have nutrients but eventually, they will run out. And you won't want to repot this plant again for a while, probably at least a year. Pileas have very fine roots so they don't fill a pot very quickly and this guy may take a while to get healthy again. You won't want to repot until it's very vigorously growing with signs of roots growing out of the bottom. Their fine roots also make bottom watering a good option because the smaller the roots the more likely they are to rot and bottom watering is a good way to prevent soaking it too much so that it doesn't dry out fast enough.  You may have over-fertilized the first time around. In the future use the fertilizer at half the recommended dilution that is on the package or get a gentle fertilizer like Espoma's liquid fertilizer. Also, a great way to give plants gentle nutrients for a prolonged period is worm castings. Just sprinkle on the top of the soil or mix into the soil before you plant something in it. Worm castings have also been found to help ward off pests. The white powder you mentioned sounds to me, like some sort of root mealybug since it was present on the roots. [Check this photo of root mealybugs and compare to what yours looked like.](https://www.google.com/search?q=root+mealybug&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiRt4KXgZbmAhU6JDQIHQRMDskQ_AUoAXoECBEQAw&biw=1440&bih=686#imgrc=M8CgFPZs1l-y5M:) If you think it is mealy bugs, the next time you water, use a 1:1 dilution of water to 3% hydrogen peroxide. This dilution is safe for your plants will kill the bugs, and will add oxygen into the soil which will assist with vigorous root growth. The added oxygen levels will also combat root rot because root rot is essentially caused by a lack of oxygen at the roots which invites bad fungus to grow in overabundance. The hydrogen peroxide will kill pests, dissolve the dead root matter, and will kill the bad fungus.  After you do that, is when I would add the worm casting, and water it into the soil on the next watering you do in order to add beneficial microorganisms back into the soil because the hydrogen peroxide will be killing everything, good stuff included. You can use this hydrogen peroxide method over repotting the next time you notice something growing on the soil. It will sanitize the soil and you will be preventing unnecessary stress to the plant by repotting it too early. Hope this makes sense, its a little all over the place, I know."

This was some years ago when I was in community college and living at home. But when it came time to transfer to a University I started to get EXTREMELY stressed. I have found that general anxiety makes my PMDD symptoms worse. My ""everyday baseline"" anxiety/depression level is always lower than my PMDD levels. But If my ""baseline"" level goes up, so does my PMDD levels (hope that makes sense). So, I started to take Zoloft and was scheduled to take for a year while I was transitioning into my new life at my new school (I moved 300 miles away from home and was essential on my own). Now I have moved even further away and have gotten a new demanding full-time job with a long commute. Needless to say my ""baseline"" is a lot higher than its been in a long time so my symptoms are getting difficult for me to manage during hell week, when before I could power through. Also, my life was pretty unstructured in college and for a few years after. With ever-changing class schedules and working in restaurants, it was difficult for me to take my pill regularly. But I had less on my plate in the big picture. Yes, I was stressed, but life was more carefree then.  Now my schedule is like a clock so I feel I'll be more responsible with it.

TalesFromYourServer,f9ex4r2,t1_f9cxd0m,1575253839.0,"I agree, but as a long-time waitress I would not feel entitled to a tip. They are meant ""to ensure proper service' but are not a requirement. If a table received proper service, then I think the waiter should receive a tip but the amount, IMO, depends on the circumstances. I started to think this way in order to manage my expectations because expecting people to tip only leads to disappointment, but requiring people to tip with a flat auto grat will also push customers away, and rightly so. 

For instance, if a party of 10 comes in, they all order water and ask for a pitcher so they can refill themselves, and get two large cheese pizzas to split and were in and out in an hour- I don't expect a huge tip even though the party was large. Some waiters find that type of table annoying because they are avoiding a higher bill, but it is 100% within the customer's right to avoid a high bill. 

 If its two people who ordered higher-end entrees with minimum two change requests to each meal, several appetizers that were requested to be put be put in approx 15 minutes before I put in their entree orders, a send back for the meat to be cooked more even though they asked for rare, two cocktails each with lengthy requests on how they are made after the asked to sample five tap beers, and if they camped out for two hours I would expect a way greater tip than 15%. This demanding behavior for a table is also within their rights, however. 

My philosophy on it is this- a waiter is conducting their own business to some extent with the restaurant being a middle man of sorts- this is especially true in states where restaurants are allowed to pay under minimum wage. Waiters get their tips directly from the customers, not from the restaurant. If one table wants to demand a large part of that waiter's supply (time/effort/ section) for the night by being demanding, having a large party, or camping out for hours, they should be obligated to pay higher rates for having higher demand. If a table chooses to claim a lower amount of the waiter's supply then they should pay a lower rate. 

However, the circumstance in OPs story is ridiculous. Tables should be able to see when things are not in the control of the waiter. Part of me thinks they do, but they choose to nitpick when they can to avoid paying a tip without a heavy conscious, or to get things discounted."
PMDD,f9ev6v9,t3_e4qqg5,1575252415.0,"Have you been diagnosed with PMDD?

Hormone fluctuations can affect serotonin levels by lowering them, which can lead to depression/anxiety symptoms. Feeling distant from your friends/ family is a normal symptom that is used in diagnosing PMDD. Also, there is a thing called ""period brain"" similar to ""pregnancy brain"" that is caused by hormone fluctuations, of course, and leads to forgetfulness, clumsiness, lack of concentration which is all exasperated by fatigue. ""Period brain"" and fatigue often make me feel awkward and too tired to put a lot of effort into making quality connections with people. I often zone out, forget what people have told me, put my foot in my mouth, sound bitchy because I'm tired and irritable, and generally get impatient with constant contact with people because it takes so much energy that I just don't have. 

&#x200B;

PMDD is not a normal way of PMSing but the symptoms you described are totally normal for PMDD. PMDD does not go away on its own and can cause difficulties in day-to-day life. If that is so, then I recommend seeing your health care provider for treatment."
survivorsofabuse,f9436x3,t1_f8x5rim,1575075995.0,"I agree with you.

I had some people tell me that it was my fault because I was drinking- which was infuriating. I had family tell me that my drinking didn’t give inherent permission for what happened to me, but they expressed concern about my drinking habits. They got me therapy sessions and self defense classes.  I realized I definitely had a drinking problem that led me to let my guard down when it wasn’t safe to. It was nice knowing there was something I could do in response to what happened, which meant to me  I wasn’t completely powerless. I was able to focus on my issues that led to the irresponsible drinking that led to unnecessary vulnerability to attacks. That felt  better than thinking I’m a complete victim with the world out to get me, with nothing to do about it- which I had felt at one point. 

All we can do is listen to them and remind them of their strength, which is so easy to forget about when you’ve been through something like an assault. I think it’s so important to tell them that they are strong while also letting them work through and express their pain in healthy constructive ways. After an assault the victims’ self and world perception will be understandably altered in a very negative way. That can easily lead to a pit of despair that can be VERY hard to get out of if you tell them it’s not their fault but don’t offer ways in which self reflect in their boundaries. I think it’s important to try and turn the focus on solutions vs the problem as soon as possible.

I have had two really close friends get drugged and raped. They came to me as their main shoulder to cry on. I let them talk and cry and work through their pain with no judgment or no blame. I acknowledged that they were victims in that situation and repeatedly reminded them that one incident like that does not define them. I reminded them over and over it wasn’t about their weakness but about the weakness of their attacker.  

I told them that they are strong and that being a victim of one violent act doesn’t make them a victim in life. I said that they have a very unfortunate problem to deal with and after hearing them out I helped them focus on solutions. 

One admitted she had a drinking problem which didn’t help her case that night and she has since gotten sober. The other admitted that she is too concerned about social perception which causes her to hang out with people she doesn’t trust but wants to impress, and to go against her own instincts while trying to please/impress others which got her into a sketchy situation that night. They both admitted that the people they were with the nights of their attacks, who they put their trust in, were unnecessarily negligent and uncaring in the events that occurred and both have cut ties with them.  

They are both still healing but they have made leaps and bounds in the process and I’d like to think that it is in part due to my focus on things THEY could control. I can attest that in these situations the hardest part is the feeling of complete lack of control. Giving them a sense of power by reminding them of the things that are in their power, I found, is extremely helpful and doesn’t have to include blaming them for anything. 

What happened to them was random and senseless but that doesn’t mean they can’t do anything to protect themselves from future abuse. 

Protecting yourself from future abuse isn’t admitting guilt it’s an act of self love."

survivorsofabuse,f8w0kub,t3_e28ty3,1574880953.0,"I agree with you- people who are attacked/assaulted are not to blame. But as adults our lives are in our own hands. It’s our responsibility to hand ourselves over to those who would treat our lives as less-than. After four bad sexual assault experiences, the most recent that made me afraid for my life, I decided something needed to change. I decided that I was not going to allow that to happen to me again. I decided that I needed stronger boundaries. I decided that I needed to be more aware of my surroundings. I decided that I needed to stop being so trusting. So I took action and helped myself.

Things happen that we can’t control, but as adults we are responsible for how we react to those things. Getting revictimized over and over due to poor boundaries is a cause for concern. An adult with poor boundaries is responsible for building stronger boundaries. 

I have been victimized but I’m not a victim. We cannot expect people to treat us as we deserve. We must learn to treat ourselves that way, to not accept less, and to learn how to protect ourselves so that people who would treat us badly don’t get the easy opportunities to take advantage.

When I was jobless after college, I thought I’d like it at first, but eventually I became a purposeless, lost, sad sack. Yes work stresses me out at times and I get exhausted but it gives me purpose. When I was younger and doing jobs that were meaningless to me I was less happy. But now that I have a job I find fulfilling I feel less of a need to escape. From time to time I do allow myself to let go. Balance is key though. I think a little distraction from the daily monotony from time to time is healthy. We don’t need to always be in the “survival” state. There are some healthier distractions like camping, hiking, or exercise which I do. But it’s stillfun for me to get drunk, be around people, and dance with my friends and be a little stupid every once and a while.

PMDD,f8uhqmx,t1_f8u9amy,1574829826.0,"I’ve done some research on PMDD and it’s been determined that it is not generally caused by abnormal hormone levels but by the body’s abnormal reaction to normal levels of hormones. 

Some people with PMDD may have abnormal hormone levels but that’s a separate medical issue. The two conditions may affect each other but they are not one in the same. Before you seek hormonal treatments make sure you know what your hormone levels are. I think it would be helpful to see an endocrinologist to get an objective report on your hormones that you can present to whoever you see to address your menstruation issues.

Also- hormonal changes in the body may lower serotonin levels during the week or so before menstruation.  If you already have naturally lower levels of serotonin this may lead to more severe mood problems than women with regular PMS (this is why women with a family history of depression may be more susceptible to PMDD). SSRIs have been proven very effective in treating PMDD. If your current medication isn’t working then I’d bring that up and get an adjustment. I got HUGE relief from my PMDD by taking only 25 mg of Zoloft a day (no longer on it as it was supposed to be situational treatment but I’m seeking further treatment for my PMDD because once I got off I saw a drastic change for the worse). So Zoloft may not be the one for you or you may need a higher dosage (not trying to diagnose- just brainstorming).

You’re on the right path but you need to make adjustments. Don’t be afraid to ask for 
or seek a change and to voice your concerns. Do your own research as well. I don’t mean self diagnose but read up on PMDD studies from reputable sources such as hospitals or medical colleges at accredited universities. The more knowledge you have the better you will be able to communicate with your health care providers and the better you will know what kind of providers to seek out. 


Also- CBD oil helps me a lot, particularly with irritation/anxiety and sleep issues associated with PMDD. If you want to avoid the psychoactive aspect of weed (I’m not against recreational weed use but it makes my mental state worse when PMSing as it makes me extra paranoid or dissociated during PMDD week). My depressed state is not helped as much though, that’s why I’m working towards getting back on SSRIs. But we’re all different so do what works for you. 

And I agree that female providers make a big difference with this kind of stuff. They can spot the nuances between period related mood issues and general mood issues. Or they are just more interested in PMDD and are better read up on it. I’m pretty sure it’s in the DSM now but it’s still in limbo between medical condition and mental health issue.  I didn’t even know what PMDD was until my marriage and family therapist (a female) brought it up and diagnosed me. She sensed changes in me form week to week, tracked my moods, then asked if I experienced heightened emotions before my period. Once she said that it all made sense and then I went forward with treatment.  

Good luck!"

So many people- people you would never expect- are deviant in some way. Sex is only one aspect of life. Your sexual preferences don’t define you or affect your value as a human being. Your are not alone. 

I’ve beat myself up for poor behaviors that are products of aspects of my upbringing that I had no control over. That isn’t my fault nor is it yours. But once we grow up enough to identify the demons we fight by name, it becomes our responsibility to tackle them even though we inherited them unwillingly. The first thing you must do, is accept your worth in spite of your past. From there you can take the steps you need to heal. You need to feel worthy of peace before your efforts can get you closer to it.

 It’s normal to have a kind of epiphany where you realize the root cause to some of your more painful life trajectories. It’s normal to feel icky towards yourself and to cringe when looking closer at yourself. BUT that feeling eventually can go away. If you do the work, go with in and really untangle the mess, you’ll start to form an understanding and from understanding comes acceptance. 

If you need outside help then take it. But for outside help to Work you must want to help yourself. The first step to wanting to help yourself is to identify you have an issue to work on, which you’ve already done. so you’re already closer to peace than most people ever get. 

I cast no judgement on you. I see that you are a human with emotions that have been played with. We all have our demons and I accept yours. You are worthy of love and you will find it one day. A great love that will wash you clean of your shame. A love that makes you feel safe and accepted."

It has been established from season 1 that in the AHS universe ghosts come back with the ability to interact with the world in a physical way, especially when killed on “unholy” ground (murder house, the hotel, now camp redwood).

It doesn’t help business, it hurts it- customers who demand that they are always right know that if they put up enough of a stink over small mistakes they’ll get discounts or free items to shut them up. Some go as far as ordering wrong ON PURPOSE in order to make a stink and get a free or discounted meal.

Friends are important to our well-bing. And by friends, I mean GOOD friends. The kind that has your back, hears you out, talks through issues, doesn't pick fights, doesn't use guilt, is honest, is respectful, and is trustworthy. That being said- not everybody who enters your life is meant to stay. People have different ideas of what it means to be a good friend, so even when you are trying, some people can feel a lack because they don't need or value what it si you have to offer. Just because that one person doesn't value it doesn't mean what you have to offer isn't valuable. You just have to find people who appreciate you for you and who won't cast blame for the things they don't like. This person doesn't sound like a great friend- definitely not somebody worth letting your self-esteem plummet for. What you think about yourself is more important than what others think. It's okay to grow apart and move on from a relationship that just isn't working anymore. It's not about who's in the wrong, its about incompatibility."

I also just wanted to add a bit of positivity by stating that going to the theatre alone is actually nice because you get fully immersed. You're not thinking about your friend next to you, or getting interrupted by their questions/ comments, etc. Especially for anything TWD related because it would be amazing on the big screen. 

In general, you might want to think of it this way- the entertainment industry is called an ""industry"" because its ultimately about money. TWD has become a huge franchise, so anything they do you can expect it to be about money. Without money there is no show (or movies) for your consumption. Just as it would be unwise for them to fully pander the movies to China, non-viewers of the show, and to AMC's wishes, it would be unwise for them to pander to people who don't want to leave the house when they are in talks about a movie trilogy. Trilogies are not often presented on TV networks or streaming services. If AMC wants to go big and grow from small to big screens, this is how they do it, it's within their right, and it's not a complete shocker. 

I, on the other hand, will be first in line to buy that movie ticket. I want to see Andrew Lincoln's beautiful buns blown up big time- just saying. I see it as a great thing. One of my long-time favorite shows is moving on up in this world."

gaslighting,f33utoy,t1_f32i17u,1570645567.0,"Because of your past positive experiences you have self respect and you know how to connect with others and to work through problems and that’s a great thing. The scary thing is- people like you get totally changed from a narcissistic relationship, they lose their healthy boundaries. Don’t let that happen. I’m not telling you to leave him today but really hold onto that sense of self and dignity you have and if that means leaving him then do that. It’s easy to let this change you- if it does you’ll attract more people like him because narcissist look for people with poor boundaries. 

The thing with men is, us woman will always clash with them. We have fundamental neurological differences that will always make certain things difficult. BUT Men who are stable and evolved will allow women to open them up to the emotional nuances of the human experience and they will love them for it. Men who are not stable and unevolved will believe emotionality is weakness and will resent women for presenting them with it. 

Don’t let this experience leave a chip On your shoulder when it comes to men like I had because of my dad. They aren’t all like that. I spent my early adult hood chasing emotionally unavailable men because I though that’s all there was and I thought to get a man to love me I had to sacrifice my dignity. After finding amazing friends who helped me see past that, I have had two great relationships with great and loving men. Yes those relationships weren’t perfect but they never are. It’s about weighing the good and the bad and if that bad out weighs the good then it’s time to move on. Relationships are about meeting in the middle- give and take. You can’t give five five without being depleted. And narcissists take take take. Eventually you’ll run out of emotional resources and will be defeated and that will lead you to settling for less than what you deserve. 

Just know he is the way he is because of a deep emotional scar. The things I outlined in my first comment are mostly unconscious behaviors to narcissists. They do it as second nature- it’s been a life time of programming that has made him this way. And the issue isn’t men- there are female narcissist too. It’s a personality type not a gender issue. Just use this as a learning experience- take note of signs and use them to avoid this type of relationship in the future. If you move on- do so with grace, compassion, and forgiveness. I say that because I have ended relationships with narcissists with spite and anger and that hurt me more than it hurt them."
gaslighting,f33t618,t1_f32hq0u,1570644646.0,"YES! One thing I dealt with from being raised by a narcissist is that it took me until I was 22 to realize what a normal relationship was. I had a childhood friend who was a narcissist and because it was what I was used to I never realized how dysfunctional our relationship was. I went away to college and I made amazing friends. She got mad at me for going away to college because i “abandoned” her so we didn’t talk for my whole first year away and because I was working I didn’t go home for any breaks. Not having her in my life, and making good friends made me realize how bad it was with her. When I went home for summer I ended our friendship within hours of seeing her for the first time in 10 months."
gaslighting,f32fvx2,t1_f32fkze,1570607212.0,"This is textbook narcissism. and the same thing gave it away for me. just how he is so fixated on himself and that hes getting upset because she is trying to stand up for her self. She is trying to meet in the middle and to connect and engage like a normal person. I'm sure that has worked for OP before and the fact that it is not working with this guy is throwing her off, bc hes not a normal person. there's not emotional vulnerability in a narcissist and thats what im getting here."
gaslighting,f32ev31,t3_df7dij,1570605634.0,"In my opinion the relationship is a wash. There is no “talking it out” with a person like him. And the world for a person like him is “narcissist”. 

Narcissistic people are not always grandiose and in love with themselves. When it comes to narcissists it boils down to two things- their interests and if you will serve them.  Everybody they come into contact with is assessed for their ability to meet their needs. They don’t see people as individuals but extensions of themselves, pawns, and a means to an end. 

They need to be in control and to do that they take to subtle but effective manipulation. If you are not easily manipulated they will switch their tactics to a show of force to intimidate you into falling into line. They create an idea about who you will be to them, and they make plans for you based on that. This is why they get so upset when you present an opposing idea or do something they don’t agree with- because it doesn’t fit their preconceived notion of who you will be to them.  And they just NEED you to be the that person.

Gaslighting is probably the most used manipulation tactic. This makes you question your own reality and sanity. Once you start questioning yourself they will present their take on reality and because you are not grounded in your own perceptions you will begin to accept theirs. This will make you more compliant to their demands, less oppositional, and more susceptible to future manipulation- which is exactly what they want. They are chipping away at who you are while creating who they need you to be. 

They have a way of justifying every bad behavior- and that’s by blaming somebody or something else. They are NEVER in the wrong. They need to believe this and they need you to support this belief. Tku can’t all to them if you have a problem with them, they won’t hear it because “they’re blameless”. They will use the “scape goat” tactic and blame you for all their problems- to your face and behind your back. This makes you fearful of making a wrong move at every turn and makes you feel guilty for mucking things up constantly. They back track on what they say- so even if you do what they say they want, the next day they can say “that’s not what I wanted, I wanted you to do it this way.” Then you feel like you’re losing your mind while you take the blame for the trouble it caused. You’ll feel like you can’t do or say anything right. 

If you don’t fall susceptible to the above tactics, defend yourself, and oppose their ingrained beliefs about you and them- they will use anything you say against you. Any display of emotion is now their amo. Anything you have said in the past is their fodder. They will find your weaknesses and use them to hit you below the belt. BUT if you play the role they wrote you, get your lines right, and land on all your queues- then yes, there will be good days, but at your own cost. 

People in an intimate/ close personal relationship with a narcissists will experience the following: a dramatic drop in self-esteem, depression, emotional fatigue, constant confusion, a need to walk on egg shells, loneliness, a sense that their partner does not truly love them, fear for their partner/friend/ family member, Worthlessness, a constant sense of guilt, and a sense they are going crazy.

Constant fighting sucks- and many people will do whatever it takes to avoid conflict. To have a smooth sailing, conflict-free relationship with a narcissist you must sacrifice your dignity, self respect, and identity. That’s just how it is. There’s no changing them. There’s no changing the relationship dynamic. Trust me- I’ve tried all my life with my dad who sounds EXACTLY like your boyfriend. 

There are a lot of good videos on YouTube about narcissism and subreddits as well. I urge you to educate yourself because after I did the deeper understanding I gained really helped me navigate the relationship and to maintain my sanity. 

I can’t choose my dad, but you can choose your boyfriend. Ask yourself- are the good days even worth what you’re dealing with the rest of the time? There are men out there who can give you the good days that you’re having with your current boyfriend on a regular basis- as the norm. Men who’ll fight with you as the exception, but who will be willing to talk it out after. It’s up to you what you allow in your life. Just know that you deserve better."

Success in your life is defined by you. What do you value? What do you believe in? Start with those questions and follow the answers. I know what you’re going through because I went through the same thing. The amazing part? I feel like a kid at 26- having a good time, having fun, no kids to weigh me down, no mortgage to eat away at my paycheck when other people my age are tired and unamused by life because their youth was better than it is now. Life can only get better from here! Don’t get me wrong, I have a job, I work hard, I live with family so I can save. I felt SO BEHIND, but I focused on my internal health and then things started happening. 

You’ll get there. If it’s a concern of yours, if it’s in your mind, if you picture it, you’ll get it. It just takes time. Just focus on enjoying yourself and being alive. Relationships, ownership, parenthood and careers all come with a new set of problems. They bring all new kinds of anxieties you’ve never even experienced before- they can be overwhelming to people who are healing. Focus on tackling what you can today. Don’t rush it. Take baby steps. 

Here’s a tip- buy a concert ticket, get friends to come with you, have a few drinks (not too many) dance your butt off till you sweat and just FEEL ALIVE. That’s what we’re here for. Your anxieties are those of our generation we all feel them to some extent, yours are just exasperated my your past. Be grateful for what you have- even your diagnosis, and don’t waste anymore time dwelling on it, and focus on getting better. You can’t heal a wound that you don’t know is there but now you know. A diagnosis is a blessing because now you know what you need to do."
awakened,f2uh5zt,t1_f2sls8k,1570416432.0,"I agree with this ego argument. So many of my girlfriends growing up knew they wanted to get married before they could even date. Some are still fixated on it. To quote one of my friends, “ I want the big diamond ring, the big house, the nice cars, the white picket fence, and beautiful children.” Never does she mention “love” and she said all this while single! So she wants the marriage without yet having the man. Which means she’ll be looking for the man that’s fits into the image she has created of marriage instead of organically falling in love and then creating a life with him together. She has already created her marriage and it’s all based on external factors- how the marriage will LOOK not feel and that’s ALL ego. And unfortunately that’s very common. 

Often times people think they need to get married because that’s what they were told to do and they don’t want to be the ones straying from the norm- which is an ego based decision. However there are times when marriages last BECAUSE people overlook their egos for the sake of the other person. 

It’s on a case by case basis."
