When she saw I was moving up and she didnt get the same. She started implying it was because the manager was into me. Telling our coworkers we probably getting intimate. Started lashing out at me when I tried to correct her work or give her tips. ( to help her move up too)

She ended up applying to our conpetitors without telling me and almost picked a fight with me when I asked her about it. ( a customer saw her and told me about it)

When she officually left she gave me and few other people she liked a treat, as a farewell. I found glass in it. When I took a pic of it and sent
 it to her all I got was a. "" the bitch got it"" it fucked up my trust in ""friends""

She tried to stay friends and talked to me. I never confronted her about it. When i told her we werent friends she tried to guilt me it was my fault and she tried."
