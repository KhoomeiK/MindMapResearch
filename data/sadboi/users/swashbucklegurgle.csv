They have had multiple names over the decades. Neuroleptics, major tranquilizers, anti-psychotics.

All of them work allot like alcohol, producing a blockade on many different types of receptors in the brain.

If you are looking for healing for your brain, try wellness, mindfulness, exercise, and 'counting your blessings'."
