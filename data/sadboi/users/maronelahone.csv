Let me also tell you that there is a way out of it. You just have to stick with your treatment plans and focus on working on yourself. Sift through your anger and try your fucking hardest to find something, even a shred of something that makes you feel happy. Even something that makes you feel something other than anger.

Focus on that one thing and use it to keep you out of your head while you find healthy ways to express your feelings so you’re not just cycling through these negative emotions every day. My personal outlet was drawing. These drawings weren’t good, some days I just went fucking crazy with a pen and blacked out pages, but it helped me release my pent up anger in a way that wasn’t self destructive.

Please, please, please don’t give up on therapists or medication. That just makes things 10000x harder for yourself, and will in turn make your feelings worse. 

We are all standing behind you here, please keep fighting this shit to the end. You will recover and feel happier. I promise. That might not mean much coming from an internet stranger, but I know how fucking dark that shit gets. Please PM me if you need to vent sometime, I mean it.
