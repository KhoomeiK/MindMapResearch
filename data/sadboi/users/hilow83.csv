BipolarReddit,fqx7cos,t1_fqvvw8q,1589727407.0,It‚Äôs not the world that would win but an accomplishment and something I could take pride  in. I like the idea of going out on my own terms. Unless I‚Äôm hypomanic or manic I‚Äôve wanted to die for about 22 years. My doctors are very straight with me. I‚Äôve exhausted all current medical treatments and we just have to hope the next med cocktail will be the one. They‚Äôre all meds I‚Äôve been on though. I also don‚Äôt necessarily want to get better because that usually always means a hop skip and bounce from hypo to manic and a forced hospitalization. I‚Äôm also sick of trials of medication before they are approved.

BipolarReddit,fqn2ahk,t1_fqmrwu6,1589487469.0,You‚Äôre not the only one who thinks this way. One of the biggest debates regarding bipolar during its most recent publication of the dam 5 was the separation of bipolar 1 and 2 because type 1 is treated more similarly to the psychotic disorders while bp2 is closer to anxiety and depression. Most people with bipolar 1 don‚Äôt have much of a choice when it comes to meds. Many persons with bp2 do.
BipolarReddit,fqfopbh,t3_gi2d7k,1589328756.0,Lol üòÇ years ago my mom was on my phone with the psychiatrist because I was refusing the added haldol. I was patrolling the perimeter of the house preparing to be attacked by terrorists. My mom comes out with all my pills. Depakote haldol and 400 mg of seroquel. I took off and I guess my mom got a headache and just popped mine by accident. She thought she had excedrin. She calls my doctor back freaking out because she can‚Äôt make herself throw up and in a nice relaxed voice he tells my mom to go lay down because she‚Äôll be getting very sleepy. She was out for a full 24. We still laugh about that one.

Good luck!"
BipolarReddit,fq6468d,t3_ggxdwf,1589124132.0,Once sleep deprivation gets to this level and bipolar mania appears you really need antipsychotics to bring it down as quickly as possible. The problem usually is that person thinks they‚Äôre fine. I‚Äôd recommend doing something my parents have done with me. When his behavior is poor and you guys are scared take a video. This could help if you need to have him committed. If he becomes threatening or violent call 911 and let medical services assess his situation. Good luck.

BipolarReddit,fpsxrng,t1_fpsxlg4,1588881412.0,That makes sense. I‚Äôd call your doctor and ask what they think. They might want to bump it up a bit.
BipolarReddit,fpsxehd,t1_fpse2sr,1588881235.0,You may want to ask your doctor about adding some type of stabilizer such as lamictal. It‚Äôs a popular combination as lamictal provides some protection against depressive relaps and you will still benefit from the abilify.

BipolarReddit,fprimbt,t3_gf5edp,1588855087.0,I‚Äôve never heard of this in relation to medication and I‚Äôve definitely been on all that you‚Äôve listed at different times. Have you measured?  I could see someone with bipolar being hypo and sexually active and consequently losing sex drive after meds have been adjusted but never heard of this. I‚Äôd be calling my doctor ASAP.

BipolarReddit,fpri5j1,t3_gf210w,1588854754.0,My sleep has dropped significantly too. I was at 20 hours about a month ago. Most nights now it‚Äôs 6-7 but a couple nights I get no more than four. I know what I‚Äôm doing if this persists. Getting a temporary script for zyprexa. Good luck with yours. Call your doctor if you can to at least report it to the assistant so if it becomes an emergency you‚Äôll likely be seen or talked to faster.
BipolarReddit,fprg913,t3_gezpzh,1588853314.0,"In 18 years of being treated I‚Äôve gone off meds twice. Once for a few days after the movie the beautiful mind came out. It‚Äôs plot was so similar to my manic government delusions I thought it was the government saying they wanted me. Fortunately I dumped all meds in the toilet and there they stayed unflushable. My parents saw called my doctor and we had a talk. 

Fast forward 18 years later I meet a navy seal while I‚Äôm hypomanic and raising doses per my doctors instructions trying to avoid mania. When I found out this guy was involved in the bin laden raid well that was it. I had my first psychotic episode after the towers came down at 18. Now I‚Äôm 36 and this navy seal popping into my life made sense. They finally needed my help lol. Long story short he convinced me the medication is making me sick. I listened and tapered off. Spent a month in the hospital and was still manic upon discharge. I was off meds for about a month. 

Other than these two times in 18 years I take my prescriptions dutifully but unfortunately that still doesn‚Äôt seem to contain episodes as much as I‚Äôd like. 

Most persons I‚Äôve met with bipolar fit into the ‚Äú I don‚Äôt need them anymore because I‚Äôm stable or like feeling hypo‚Äù."
BipolarReddit,fpps1o1,t3_gesrew,1588808038.0,Abilify is better in regards to weight. Zyprexa has the highest gains vs. placebo.
BipolarReddit,fpo1a56,t3_gekvny,1588776564.0,"Aside from not missing medication my depressive episodes are very similar to what you‚Äôre describing. I‚Äôm in the process of working with an attorney on a mental health declaration, power of attorney and possibly limited guardianship.  The only advice I have for you is to attempt to bring in these options during a calm conversation. Going nuclear on a person with little to live for can backfire and make things worse. I‚Äôd consult with an attorney first to determine which may be the best for your dad. 

I‚Äôd also like to mention a drug that is being talked about more. Spravato or esketamine literally killed my depressive episode faster than electro shock. Unfortunately I cycled again into mania and my next depression didn‚Äôt really have the same results but I‚Äôll always be fascinated with the experience because it worked magic. 

Good luck and I hope things get better."

BipolarReddit,fpcsf3s,t3_gbo1kw,1588511391.0,Bipolar depression is more episodic than unipolar depression. The importance of this is getting the right treatment. Someone with unipolar depression usually rely on anti depressants whereas someone who is in a bipolar depression might be treated with some of the antipsychotics at lower dosages so it doesn‚Äôt antagonize the disorder.
BipolarReddit,fpcrmvz,t3_gbo1kw,1588510750.0,Also should note bipolar depression presents differently than unipolar depression.

BipolarReddit,fpa0v2a,t1_fpa08ki,1588438550.0,"Yeah well unfortunately for me if I‚Äôm talking out loud because my thoughts are racing too fast chances are I‚Äôm sleeping less and getting unwanted attention. If I don‚Äôt do something ASAP it‚Äôs a guaranteed trip to the psych ward and then it‚Äôs devastating. The truth for persons with bipolar 1 is you generally have to increase medication from time to time, stay on high doses until the symptoms have passed and begin slowly titrating doses down after a couple months. Don‚Äôt be shy. Mania is extremely damaging and most of us suffer an equally hellish depression afterwards. The quicker you can short circuit the episode the briefer the consequences. Good luck."
BipolarReddit,fp9zztx,t1_fp9zvpy,1588438050.0,This is a symptom I‚Äôm aware of for me and we generally start increasing medication rapidly to prevent a full blown mania.
BipolarReddit,fp9zonp,t3_gc99di,1588437870.0,Yes when the thoughts race to fast I‚Äôll catch myself talking out loud. It‚Äôs a short route to mania from this point for me.
BipolarReddit,fp8c7gz,t3_gbx5zm,1588388686.0,I think your doctor is very irresponsible to medicate with this cocktail. This is a horrible regimen for someone who experiences mania.

Outside of occasionally getting hot shots for acting up in a hospital to be forced to take medication is when the courts deem it necessary. Usually unless the person becomes violent and criminal the courts will not do this. What is more common is when the courts side with your doctor while you are inpatient and order that you must. Once out of the hospital it‚Äôs a different story.
BipolarReddit,fp327ir,t3_gb1d3z,1588271828.0,Yes my one remaining friend I talk to has both.
BipolarReddit,fp31g3n,t1_fp2zvz1,1588271460.0,Unfortunately this isn‚Äôt always reliable for me. For many years this was one of the go too for my acute mania along with others. Over the last two years I‚Äôve had a couple instances during mania where anything over a hundred gave me restless legs and prohibited sleep. We had to take a break on this one. If another mania hit I‚Äôd probably go back on zyprexa or invega temporarily. There were also times when hospitalized 800 mg only helped when added to my mood stabilizer along with haldol and benzodiazepines. I can also remember times on 800 where it would hit me so heavily I learned crawling to bed was safer because walking to my bed ended up with me falling into things.  This is why I call seroquel my love hate drug.
BipolarReddit,fp2nmn2,t1_fp2ndho,1588264830.0,I never said this person isn‚Äôt on a course to mania. Simply stated that this poster is currently hypomanic.

BipolarReddit,fp2lhhf,t1_fp2i9gk,1588263798.0,Mania is much more severe than this. This poster hits many of the criterion for hypomania.

BipolarReddit,foyl2bc,t1_foydrp2,1588174442.0, I think Ian. The middle brother? If I can recall the mother turns out to be bipolar as well? But it‚Äôs been a long time since I watched.
BipolarReddit,fowhayf,t3_g9t6c1,1588119768.0,The show shameless. One of the episodes featured the one brother going through a mania.
BipolarReddit,fow31lc,t3_g9uynw,1588112087.0,Yes. About ten years ago. Doctor took me off after some blood tests. It hits you. If I had to compare it to any others in terms of bringing me down maybe high dosage of zyprexa or invega sustenna. It‚Äôs definitely effective just keep up with blood work.
BipolarReddit,foqkfi5,t3_g8u9hs,1587995531.0,I broke off a relationship recently too. The part that hurts the most is not talking to her anymore. I miss the sex and cuddling too. But it turned out to not be a good match. Sorry you‚Äôre hurting.
BipolarReddit,foqk7fr,t3_g8zom9,1587995395.0,We tried this but I became manicky. We discontinued and everything was ok.
BipolarReddit,foqjdcd,t1_fop2ys5,1587994885.0,I‚Äôm sorry. I jump into relationships quickly too. This one fooled me because we had taken time to learn about one another. Lesson learned. And yeah being dependent on someone for your source of happiness usually leads to a bad ending. The part of me that is relieved is knowing I have more work to do on myself while getting out of this funk and now no longer have to be with someone. I‚Äôm not excited to be single but dating is so tough. At this point I kinda just want a fwb situation that is less serious. Good luck to you too!
BipolarReddit,fop1bx7,t1_fop1131,1587950907.0,I hope so!  Same to you. Next time I need to slow down. Live and learn I guess.
BipolarReddit,fop16m1,t3_g8q02o,1587950816.0,Once I told my doctor I couldn‚Äôt deal with weight gain when they hit me with zyprexa. I‚Äôd be willing to go on a lower dose if necessary along with other meds if necessary but it was unreal. I was 200 up from my former life of 125 or below and that was hard to deal with.
BipolarReddit,fop0qqo,t3_g8omrc,1587950537.0,Yes someone who is in a depression or stable will likely be on a lower dose. Like many atypical antipsychotics it can have an anti depressant effect. This drug tends to be dosed out at 30 mg when fully manic often along with a few others. I‚Äôve never read about a specific cut off though.
BipolarReddit,foom7zd,t1_foo783u,1587941783.0,Ha yeah me too but it is what it is. I believe that one happened in 2016 and lasted longer than any I‚Äôve had. I thought the one positive was it got me back living on my own but as of two months ago I‚Äôm back at home living with my parents again so I guess not. And so it goes.

All my other medication had to be raised to high levels or switched out and I‚Äôll always have those horrible memories with me.
BipolarReddit,foo4eli,t1_foo0toh,1587932283.0,"I blame certain drugs to be honest more so than the person. It creates an atmosphere when lying becomes critical to hide your use from others, funnel money etc. I don‚Äôt think my bro or ex wanted that in their life.

I‚Äôm taking your initial advice though and not putting anymore thought into it. Sorry about your Aunt!  Take care."
BipolarReddit,fonzsz5,t1_fonyvm1,1587929709.0,"Yep you did the right thing. It would have been hard enough to date a bp1 person and I knew that going in. Wasn‚Äôt the case unfortunately. About ten years ago when my brother lived with me I was convinced he had to be bipolar. Nope. Heroin, coke and speedballs. Her little 3 day depression was tied in to the crack coma after she had come down. Additionally she rotates doctors frequently and hides facts. And her description of mania sounded like perhaps a hypomanic one but definitely not mania. Then again if you‚Äôre smoking crack yeah you‚Äôll fit the dsm guidelines with shitty doctors. However her ability to flip on a dime fits too well with borderline and or drug abuse. I actually blame the incompetent doctors for not ordering blood tests in the beginning or ever."
BipolarReddit,fony5k2,t1_fonx8ex,1587928781.0,Haha I replied to this comment but it posted up top? My bad I probably hit the wrong button.
BipolarReddit,fony0xu,t3_g8j3ns,1587928707.0,Yeah over the four months we dated I noticed her what she referred to as depression and mania didn‚Äôt quite fit. But based on the history I got from her and her family heroin was a big part of her life and later turned to crack. Like my brother said when he finally went into a long term rehab (for heroin) bro half his peers had a bipolar disorder. By the time rehab was done all but one was actually bipolar. It had a medical facility attached and they would detox them from drugs and psychiatric ones. Most were fine once they sobered up. Her flippancy and lies plus the histrionics lead me to believe she‚Äôs an addict. If there is a mental illness in her I do believe it‚Äôs borderline.
BipolarReddit,fonwefk,t1_fonuymz,1587927789.0,Me too. Thanks btw. I had her committed because when I found her and her buddy smoking she freaked and threatened suicide then attempted to act on it. Hated me for it then loved me for doing that for her. Three days ago I went over and we talked. I asked her to come clean with the lies and she disclosed some. I was satisfied and we got back together for a day. Next day more lies came forward and I broke it off with her. Her response reminds me of persons with borderline. She texts saying how I just came over to rape her and she was telling her brothers all about it??? I blocked her and debated calling the police to report what she said but didn‚Äôt because I never heard from her family that loved me. Crazy thing is when she was hospitalized the first thing she said was if we break up I‚Äôm going to do something bad. I thought she‚Äôd probably threaten suicide or something so her text was very unexpected. I don‚Äôt tolerate bullshit. Lies and crack. Wonder if she really is bipolar or she‚Äôs just been a drug addict her whole life? Her doctors knew nothing. The sex was great but I cannot look past everything else.
BipolarReddit,fonva6i,t3_g8j8kz,1587927153.0,I really only have two hobbies but they really only tend to keep my interest during hypo mania. Chess is one but cognitively impossible when depressed or manic. Ok when stable. Pool is the other but it‚Äôs lost it‚Äôs fun because at stability I‚Äôm pretty decent but when hypo all the angles and math come quickly and people that I used to play against thought I was fucking with them because there were periods when I would beat some really good amateurs. I like to read but that only occurs during stability. I‚Äôm not creative so art stuff really doesn‚Äôt apply with me. I do try my best to play chess fairly frequently because as my doctors pointed out my rating goes up about two hundred points and is an indication that I‚Äôm likely in a hypomanic episode.
BipolarReddit,fonuffq,t3_g8j3ns,1587926673.0,I thought I found mine about five months ago. I got to know her over about four months before that. She said she was bp 1 also and we clicked. Fast forward to a week ago. Turns out she lies through her teeth. I found her smoking crack. Honesty with partners and doctors are very important to me. This kinda hurt. I hadn‚Äôt dated seriously for ten years. So yeah that relationship is over. Dating is tough.
Psychosis,fongdmg,t3_g801bd,1587918977.0,When I‚Äôm manic and particularly psychotic most of the time I believe government is everywhere and I‚Äôm being watched 24/7. I act on these beliefs because my brain is telling me it‚Äôs as real as the ground I‚Äôm walking on. This of course makes me frantic and paranoid. This last episode I had was made even worse because I was committed to the psych ward and there were quite a few military people. Of course I believed they were put there to assist or guide me and it extended my stay. The worst is when the psychosis breaks and you can no longer make sense of concepts that you completely understood for a good deal of time. The paranoia and belief that I‚Äôm on some type of mission makes it intense. When police start getting called I generally can deal with them calmly??? Why??? Because they are below the CIA and my job is to fit in. Sorry your friend is dealing with this. It is incredibly nerve racking. Usually for me this only ends when all types of medication are raised to high levels.
BipolarReddit,fo8hgwq,t3_g6bb11,1587596636.0,Mixed episodes after abruptly stopping medication is common. Call your doctor ASAP and find out how you can restart them. Don‚Äôt just go back on without a consult.

BipolarReddit,fo8bsm5,t3_g69ywq,1587593564.0,About 3 weeks ago my intrusive suicidal thoughts stopped. Sleep went fairly quickly from 20 hours to 8. Last 3 days sleep has been way to short with zero sleep last night. A week ago when I looked at how much the sleep had changed we bumped up the seroquel and added melatonin back in. We shall see. So far nada.
BipolarReddit,fo0ihpm,t3_g4ultn,1587413742.0,This is a drug that acts like a stimulant. All I can tell you is we started on half the lowest dose and in 3 days time I was up 24/7 with the fastest raciest thoughts I‚Äôve ever experienced. Any doctor familiar with bipolar will tell you it certainly has the potential to do this.
BipolarReddit,fnzxmh7,t3_g4ultn,1587402512.0,This drug shot me into a psychotic mania within a week. Never experienced anything like it. We micro dosed this but no cigar.
doordash,fnt1jdn,t3_g3qwgw,1587232835.0,Mine too
BipolarReddit,fmrir6z,t1_fmq71go,1586324448.0,This posters response regarding seroquel happens frequently when doses are dropped that fast. A lot of times we have to make more than one med switch at a time which is unfortunate because it‚Äôs harder to identify what is doing what. I‚Äôve been on all the current available injections. Abilify wasn‚Äôt bad. It beat taking a pill everyday but wasn‚Äôt strong enough to hold back an episode. Invega was my personal nightmare. I‚Äôm consistent with meds so a drawback for me was having to go in to get the shot. Also remember you can ask your doctor to prescribe an anti nausea pill while you‚Äôre dealing with changes.
BipolarReddit,fmrbc4o,t1_fmrazxj,1586318454.0,It will I think. My parents will be starting the process with their attorney so he‚Äôll handle this aspect.  Thanks again.
BipolarReddit,fmra2ga,t1_fmr9k7f,1586317517.0,We‚Äôve done power of attorney. I appreciate your response to these questions. It makes more sense to me. Yes this is a last resort. I have a long history now of becoming very incapacitated for prolonged periods of time. So hopefully this will make things go a little more smoothly. Thanks again.
BipolarReddit,fmr8cpj,t1_fmr5m32,1586316303.0,I don‚Äôt understand some of this.  I don‚Äôt know what co- conservators mean for example?  Thanks very much for the reply. Why do I need a court ordered psych evaluation?  I have both a psychologist and psychiatrist. Can‚Äôt they just submit the documents? I‚Äôm 36 btw and in agreement with my parents about this so why the need to petition? Lastly any clue if this can be done quickly? Thanks again.
BipolarReddit,fmr3vep,t1_fmr3b1n,1586313272.0,"There are most definitely ways to stop them. If you weren‚Äôt getting enough sleep finding a drug that accomplishes that is key. My problem is sleep starts going and getting it back isn‚Äôt helped much by current meds.

Edit. Most importantly your only symptom that you‚Äôre seeing may be less sleep but it‚Äôs usually the continuous lack of adequate sleep that will lead to the symptoms you don‚Äôt currently have. If you‚Äôre sleeping poorly for the next week you might be talking fast then for example. Getting control of the sleep is so critical."
BipolarReddit,fmr3jya,t1_fmr2pyx,1586313060.0,"I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm at that point yet. I would absolutely love to function normally. I‚Äôd imagine it would look something like work, maybe being able to make and keep some friends, girlfriend and returning to living independently where I can manage myself. If I look at it the other way it‚Äôs too much. Congratulations by the way on ten months!"
BipolarReddit,fmr2s1c,t3_fwn9su,1586312538.0,This is a common drug for me to get hit with when manias start. The weight gain is unreal. I should note that my dosing is always at the other extreme I don‚Äôt have experience with doses like this.
BipolarReddit,fmr1dgn,t3_fwpge3,1586311633.0,"All I can really add is if you‚Äôre actively looking at information on certain websites etc. consider stopping for a bit. Relax on watching news. Many of my episodes in the past picked up after I became too into certain subjects, conspiracy and taking in too much news. Also it might not be a bad idea for you to write down your current thoughts on the pros and cons of your medication for something to refer back to in a month or so. It can also show your doctor how your thoughts are progressing if they do. If you decide not taking your medication please call your doctor to taper off properly so you don‚Äôt go through withdrawal."
BipolarReddit,fmr0jbw,t3_fwwysh,1586311094.0,"I get this thoroughly. After 18 years of manias depression and brief periods of stability it gets harder for me to picture what stability is like. Will I fool myself into thinking yay we finally found a working combo?  I suppose if I improved over the course of the next few months and had a good year I might start thinking better times are ahead. All I know is I need to protect the ones I love from manias I still cannot comprehend. Will I be back in bed two years from now?  Will I ever be able to work when I cannot consistently handle the most basic tasks like self hygiene, regulation of sleep?  

I do hope for some normalcy but am also trying to be realistic and so are my doctors. I hope newer medication comes through. I really thought I found a miracle drug for at least the depression when I started spravato. It just temporarily put me out of misery. But then the last four administrations produced no results. I‚Äôm apprehensive about this gradual return to life but am already scared shitless about how my next episode will unfold. My mom has congestive heart failure and I don‚Äôt want to be the reason her heart goes out. My manias destroy their lives too. If I knew how much bullshit I was in for 18 years ago I just would‚Äôve simply ended my life. Now it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I‚Äôve invested so much time in trying to control these cycles that I‚Äôm just exhausted thinking about it. Best of luck to you! I hope your days get better. And I hope you‚Äôre able to ease back into stability with more success."
BipolarReddit,fmqoiyr,t3_fwvlil,1586303721.0,Happy birthday!  Mom‚Äôs are the best.
BipolarReddit,fmnne2a,t3_fwcmfp,1586230199.0,Usually after a manic episode all my friends that I made while stable split or avoid me.
BipolarReddit,fmn5gad,t1_fmn3oc0,1586218601.0,I don‚Äôt know what to say exactly. I just try to learn what I can potentially do to prevent it again and hope it works.
BipolarReddit,fmn53um,t3_fw7ay4,1586218394.0,"I felt very ashamed too collecting ssdi and still am. I worked hard last year started a gig job because it would be a path towards a possible more regular job.  Thought I was doing pretty ok too. Instead I cost the taxpayers an additional 90,000 in hospital care and I don‚Äôt even want to post the cost of the medication costs because it‚Äôs too much for me to process. I remember my trip to Cameroon. I‚Äôm one person who could feed a dam country if I didn‚Äôt exist."
BipolarReddit,fmn388w,t3_fw9kgo,1586217266.0,Hey at the end apologizing is good regardless in certain cases. Sometimes we do stupid shit.
