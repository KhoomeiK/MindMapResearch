mentalhealth,fps4tor,t1_fpqeuwj,1588867477.0,"I agree. I have been training for purification of intrusive thoughts and feelings. Currently, It’s as if I’m in limbo. Not completely overwhelmed by the dark feelings, not spirited by the good. Just floating in the middle with bouts of each. I have never seen purification training through to the end where I believe feelings of peace is a primary and negative energy is secondary. Logging the progress has begun and might update if some of the techniques with discipline lead me to a more heavenly state of being. 

May you also find peace"

Nootropics,fprg6vy,t3_gf44zq,1588853268.0,"How much concerta? 
Was it doctor prescribed or is this rec based? 

If you are one who can concentrate, have fairly steady streams of conscious, overall are mentally and physically healthy...and then start taking 20-40-80mg of concerta or amphetamines everyday. Then I will guarantee there will be consequences.  

If you take a researched and doctor prescribed (not always right) amount of your medication for your diagnosed adhd then you are helping your brain. A low amount of dopamine and Serotonin can be dangerous. 

If you are concerned about the side effects of concerta. Might I suggest trying a protein rich diet (tyrosine is found in protein rich foods and can create dopamine), exercise and meditation. If you are already doing this...great! If not, This will at least give you a starting block to log your results. There are also many natural alternatives that can be tested with less side effects. Be careful of dosage.  

Best of luck! I enjoyed the fuel analogy. Also do not be overly concerned on dopamines roll in schizophrenia, bp or did. These are very complex illnesses with many components.

Edit- #5 Ritalin, coffee...they are fuel with a built in accelerator (Norepinephrine). They go hand in hand."

It’s not your fault you are feeling this way. I hope you don’t feel you have to defend yourself. Just love yourself and be respectful of how you feel.

Anxiety,fo8rmi6,t3_g6ci3y,1587602412.0,"I trained for the attacks. The subtle version of my training- guided meditation, working out, and eating clean. 
The intense portion of my training may not be everyone’s cup of tea but when I was feeling of sound mind I would run hills to get my heart rate up and trigger an attack. Then I would lay in the grass and say “okay, let’s get this over with.” Go through the shakes, the world ending, my body thinking it was shutting down and wait it out. Sometimes minutes sometimes hours. Today marks 4 weeks of no attacks and very little anxiety. I have lived with anxiety, depression, insomnia and psychotic episodes for 14 years. I’m 28 and am feeling like I’m gaining skills in dealing with it.

Things that are true: 
You are a good person 
You will overcome this 
You will be stronger and wiser because of this experience 

Things that are NOT true 
You will go insane 
You are dumb 
You fucked Up 
You let yourself down 
This is unforgivable 
Pretty much anything negative 

I’m not sure how long the floaters will last but you will get used to them and eventually they will fade and you’ll miss them... jk but they will fade. 

Give yourself time. Don’t stress. Every time a negative thought comes in. Take a deep breathe, hold, release and say, “you’ll be okay, I promise” 
I promise you will come out of this better then before if you start making healthy mental and physical choices."
Psychosis,fo5kwqi,t3_g5tpf4,1587528185.0,"“If you get the message, hang up the phone.” Allan watts. Sounds like you came out unscathed by most accounts. This may be your brain telling you things are changing so tread with caution. I had a similar experience 8 years ago and it all eventually faded. Working out, guided*** (important to trust your teacher) meditation and wood working helped me get through what I now refer to as my “disassociated” period. 
What did not help was marijuana, alcohol and more psychedelics. I dabbled thinking I was the same guy but quickly realized my chemistry had changed and know longer could handle drugs or alcohol. I’m for the most part sober besides a beer or two. I’m very grateful for my time with psychedelics but even more grateful for my partial sanity.

You are young to have learned the lesson of “get back on your feet.” Even though you may feel as if you are broken beyond most people’s comprehension. Keep going. Keep moving forward as little as the steps may be. Relish in every single movement in a different direction. “The path is there, it’s up to you to walk it. “
I began drawing when I was in a residential treatment facility. It was a historic success for me as just months before I was in the hospital thinking I would never be able to lift a finger again. 11 years later I’m feeling well enough to attempt to help others. The road has been long but it is worth it. 

Something someone once told me- 
Many will not understand you, they will look at your past and fear it. When you become strong, they will not comprehend how you overcame it. They will envy you and ask for advice. If that’s something you want then it is a great possibility for you. 

I’m rooting for you my friend!"
