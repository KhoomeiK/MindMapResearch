Cast out by his immortal brothers for the crime of being annoying he has spent eons in lonely isolation.
 Now this is the sad part because the Ojo looks like the most terrifying nightmare imaginable but he is completely without evil or malice. He just cannot experience pain or fear and has a zero understanding of it. And he is ridiculously, desperately lonely. He just wants a friend. Somebody. Anybody! 
""Aww human, why are you screaming so much? Your friend was filled with such pretty red ribbons! Here I'll put them on you! See now your so pretty! And I can put your ribbons on them too!"" *Squelch *rip
""Human? Human get up!"". *Another squelch as it's tentacles work inside the body and up to the nervous system. Now he's just talking to himself. ""Oh thank you Mr Ojo I feel so much better now!"" 
The Ojo is to be pitied and feared, and avoided at all cost."
