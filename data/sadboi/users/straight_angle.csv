InstacartShoppers,fmyd172,t1_fmy6qhl,1586483327.0,"I get that, but it shouldnt be like this. And in one of my trips, the missing items were only 5 out of 66 so my tip which was $55, was not based on the price of the items because it went down $11. This is insane and super frustrating. Tips should be ours to keep. When they ask me to accept a batch for $66, they should give me $66, not $56. If they want to take tips, then they should give us between numbers like from $40-60. And that 3 days to change the tip.... ridiculous. People cant go back to a restaurant 2 days later and take their tip back from the server.... come on. We gotta do something about this."
InstacartShoppers,fmy4hu2,t1_fmxmgal,1586477939.0,Me neither but IC takes my tips big time.

How is that fair? I busted my behind, and its not like its our fault that most stores are out of essential items. I am really upset. Has Anybody else gone through this? I am going to email them tomorrow to fix it."
uberdrivers,fl18fyd,t1_fl14dei,1584724029.0,Well that sucks. I was under the impression that things were better for all uber drivers. One more example of uber not giving a crap about their drivers.

bipolar2,fds5opr,t1_fds0xeb,1578694927.0,"Girl, the stigma related to mental health issues is real and I wish people would start taking it more serious. I got fired as soon as I got back from a forced medical leave, because nobody cared and took my condition serious. So i understand why you keep it secret. I will never disclose it with an employer. The problem is that i cant get a job after i was fired. Now i have to drive uber, and even that is not easy for me. Forget being happy, i will settle for just being productive at this point. 
But it will get better right?"
bipolar2,fds5a5s,t1_fds3z2t,1578694667.0,"So relatable. The thing is that my meds put me in something like an in between phase where there are no hypomania, or severe depression, but just meh days and then depressed periods where i cant do anything yet I am not crying or feeling sad. In those, i just feel drained and powerless. I wish i could get rid of that inactivity and inability to be a productive adult who can take care of herself."

bipolar2,fdrohz4,t1_fdr2kt8,1578687353.0,"I totally relate with that. I dont drink, but tend to sleep a lot and want to do all these things only to end up doing nothing all day.

You are doing great, and I wish I knew the fix so we all can live again, but unfortunately I don't. I don't share anything about my condition with the few people who I couldn't manage to push away, because just like you, I think they are tired of hearing about it. Shit, I am tired of experiencing it. One thing that really helped me, well for a while anyways, is a book called ""A new earth"". I should read it again, coz obviously I forget easy.

bipolar,fdqunss,t1_fdbd1ln,1578675160.0,I took wellbutrin but it made my anxiety worse and i became snappy. Nothing else. No energy and still binge eat like its an Olympic sport
bipolar,fdqugxv,t1_fdbd1ln,1578675096.0,"Thank you for caring and leaving me a comment. I am taking lamotrigine and trintellix. At first it was great. I felt myself but after a while i am in a meh mood, super lazy, withdrawn and mostly depressed than not. Have all these things i like to do, but cant seem to do any of them, including work. Showering on most days seems like an 8 hrs workday. I try to snap out of, talk myself into being proactive, but its like sleeping is always the more attractive choice. And dont get me started with my eating disorder that have been slowly but progressively developing..... no insurance, steady work or income and all the progress i made went down the drain. I need to file for dissability because i need help to get on my feet and have nobody around that can help me because they think i choose to feel like this. How can i get out of this hell?"
bipolar,fdqtvg1,t1_fdarpld,1578674767.0,"You are not a bad parent! I am sure you are giving it your all. We all have our good and bad days, and the bad days should not define us. Unfortunately, my ""close"" people see only the bad ones and judge me, which makes me want to not exist. My dogs have saved my life numerous times, and although my relationship with them is super close and too dependent, I wouldnt have it any other way. Its a vicious circle for me and cant get out of it."
bipolar,fdqtgzz,t1_fdbibxw,1578674523.0,"That is great to hear. So happy to hear when people feel better and enjoy life. I have been looking and driving uber in the meantime, and i am terrified that i will end up homeless if something doesnt change."
bipolar,fdauczy,t1_fdatzcu,1578250284.0,I do too but today my parents destroyed me with their comments and i couldnt help myself - i lost it and asked them to go stay at my sister's house.

Along with therapy, my life has been way better. Still struggling, but its not nearly as bad as it was.
