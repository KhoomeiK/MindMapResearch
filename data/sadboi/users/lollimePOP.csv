ForeverAlone,ewlhazr,t1_ewhyb4z,1565524221.0,"Yeah our friends don't have much time, they're living their own lives"
ForeverAlone,ewlh9tz,t1_ewhqiue,1565524179.0,"Yep true. I don't hate all humans. I still have friends, it's just the romantic relationship I think that I am looking for. And that's why I have to work hard to brush off this feeling of alienation."
ForeverAlone,ewhppn2,t1_ewholu4,1565416671.0,interacting with people really makes me irritated and just wanna dig a whole and hide there
ForeverAlone,ewhph6v,t1_ewhidm8,1565416388.0,"Sometimes, once in a blue moon, I find the interest of going out, but once I get to the place and start interacting with people, it makes me want to go home again."
ForeverAlone,ewho3sk,t1_ewhluba,1565414811.0,"Yeah so true although I try sometimes to go on online dating apps, I find it hard to continue meeting the person in real life. It's a barrier that I can't cross somehow."
ForeverAlone,ewg25pj,t3_co03f3,1565372243.0,"I also ALWAYS dream of having a boyfriend who's so much sweet that even after the dream, I still feel how much I loved him inside the dream. And for a second I wake up, I thought it was all real. Anyway, in my dreams the boys face is always blurred tho, but he's slim and tall."

depression,ew463rf,t3_cmmstv,1565103674.0,"Man so true. You just really hit the spot for me. One thing I noticed with people like us is that we are great pretenders. We project ourselves to others in the most perfect way. I guess because that's what we want to show them, that we are happy. But the eyes would never lie. We could give the greatest smile, the nicest tone when we laugh, but it could never reach the eyes."
ForeverAlone,ew3vauk,t1_ew2hrxk,1565095905.0,Dude talk to me
ForeverAlone,ew184gk,t3_cmakfp,1565017441.0,"I totally know the feeling of questioning yourself what is left in life to live for. Every morning I wake up knowing that it will be a whole day of torture again. And it makes me more depressed that I know I don't have the strength anymore to fight the feeling of hopelessness my whole life. But I'm too afraid myself to end it all. I can't do it man. So I just wish I die of natural cayse or by accident. Ain't that more convenient? All I wanna say is that, you're not alone dude. Somewhere in this world, you have a person experiencing the same thing you're in right now. So let's both hang on. Life may surprise us someday."
depression,evy0lqw,t3_clqg9m,1564917419.0,"Dude I'm totally the same, infact my daydream revolves around historical ages. Like victorian era, egyptian, and old chinese locations. I don't know why. I just find solace with these types of daydreams. It's better than my none existing life. I also thought I was pathetic. But before I sleep at night, I just imagine these fantasies, then I can sleep better. Thanks for letting me relate to you man."
depression,evy06tv,t1_evxphsj,1564916844.0,"Thanks man, I am really trying my best to get my mood up and not think too much anymore. It's true, depression is a tough enemy. It makes me dwell on my negative thoughts. I'll be better, I promise."

sex,epn6ud5,t1_epn4q56,1559322478.0,"I can't express just by typing here how happy I am reading your comment. You see, I myself know deep down inside that I'm ready. I'm not waiting for the right person or etc. I just know I'm ready and I'm seeing and feeling my body everyday getting ready as ever. But there's always hardships ,and one I'm facing right now is that I don't have the freedom to just do it with a guy. First of all, it's hard to find a guy who'll become a boyfriend.  I'm living with my mom and I can't wait to have a place of my own. And I think it would be quite stupid of me to just do it with a random guy just for my random feelings of being horny. Like I said , the world I live in is very conservative. It ain't a free world in here. kind of old fashioned really. That's why the struggle is real. But I truly loved how great you taught me things. To not think much and just be honest with myself. I'll be remembering what you said."
sex,epn4bzt,t1_epn1t05,1559321125.0,"thank you very much this is higly appreciated. I am so relieved that there are actually some of you who could make me feel better. You really got what I needed to know. I also hope I could find someone, but for now, I'll have to be patient because it's not possible for now."
sex,epn267w,t1_epn1gmz,1559320186.0,"sorry, it's just that where I live, people are very conservative. And I don't have any means of letting out my frustrations. It's like I'm not being myself. But thanks haha, that assured me somehow"
sex,epmz4tn,t3_bv9f6d,1559319165.0,I think we have the same circumstances
