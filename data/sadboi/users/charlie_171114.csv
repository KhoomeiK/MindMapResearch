depression,fd3jx5r,t3_ejw74l,1578159018.0,"Your feeling is normal, not only because you are 19 and going through a transition in life but also that's how we are always gonna feel about the past: we looked back with so many wishes and regrets but couldn't do anything about it because no one can turn back time. 

I can't give you advices on how to live your life or tell you that everything is gonna be better eventually. But I want you to know that it's okay to feel this way, I understand you."
depression,fcz5z63,t3_ejlxgu,1578094352.0,Angry is good. At least you feel something. I don't think you want to reach the point where you don't feel or don't want to feel anything anymore.

depression,fcx3f1l,t3_ejdkyk,1578049507.0,"Yes. Sometimes after a good chat with my friends I did feel more relaxed and start to make small plans for the week.

But a few hours past and all those thoughts of 'having nothing to live for. Nothing matters' and 'why do I even bother' or 'they are all gonna forget about me and leave me eventually' came back to me and I started to feel too much, way way worse than when I  was to begin with. I then dropped every I was doing to literally go to sleep, hoping when I woke up it would all go back to square one when I was just numb and not horrible like this."
wowthanksimcured,f294b3s,t1_f27v93m,1570080148.0,What an excellent way to put it
depression,f2375v5,t3_dbnzvm,1569908880.0,"Well same here. It should be an easy task but I just can't bring myself to do it. At one point I feel guitly for being ""lazy"" but I can't. I simply can't."

Pretty helpful for someone as depressed as I am so 
thanks?"
depression,f22vo80,t3_dbku0n,1569898179.0,"I'm around your age and at your exact situation. I have stopped going to college for 6 months now. 
I don't ear daily, it's usually once every 3 4 days or whenever I feel hungry. 

My sleep pattern is also messed up. I'm bored, tired most of the time. I can't focus on anything, I don't want to go out and I can't stand seeing anyone even though I'm living with my fam.

The only thing keeps me going (so far, I think) is texting with my friend online. 

I don't want to seek professional help, one reason is that I don't trust my country mental health services, but mainly I think I don't have any reasons to get better - I probably don't want to."
depression,eznjxig,t3_d1g6y0,1568007062.0,Good luck
depression,ezni35o,t3_d1lp30,1568006275.0,At least I feel normal here
depression,ezgd9wv,t3_d10qa0,1567895271.0,"This is exactly how I feel. To a point I start questioning myself ""Do I want to get better? Do I need to get better?""

My whole life was a long line of mistakes after mistakes, and the future terrifies me. Nothing can guarantee that my next step would not be another failure, why do I have to continue? On the other hand, I have stopped feeling sad or miserable, instead, I don't feel anything but tired and drained. 

Call me a coward, I am truly one but I'm so so sick of this life."
depression,ezfaxn5,t3_d0vy6y,1567875345.0,"Your post made me realize how much I miss my old self too. If 14-year-old me saw me right now she'd be so disappointed. That girl was so bright and bubbly, full of dreams and even ambitious. Where did she go? I have failed to become the person I wanted to be now I've lost myself too. I just feel so so empty"
depression,ezf94o4,t3_d0tpei,1567874610.0,Same. I can't guarantee my suicide would be 100% fatal and that thought is torturing me
depression,ez7rbd4,t3_d03qcg,1567727370.0,"Art and graphic design. There're a few bumps while I was learning but I enjoyed it very much. I was even planning to make a career out of it. 

But then I was told I had no talent in it and I guessed I let that soak in."
depression,ez6kgyy,t3_d01jay,1567713045.0,"I think I understand why I don't want to open up. I talked to exactly One Person - a very closed friend of mine about how I feel, and after I'm done talking, she replied with a question: ""Why?""

Most of our converstations ended with our disagreement. At the time I didn't know I was falling into depression, I just talked about how I felt scared about moving on because all the changes I made turned out to be mistakes after mistakes. When I realized this topic was going nowhere I asked her whether I upset her and if she wanted to continue talking about this. She said she couldn't understand me, and why I felt what I felt or feared what I feared, and it made her upset that she could not help me, so yes she didn't want to talk about this anymore. So for the sake of our friendship, I avoided talking about my (depressive) feelings.

The point is that What is the point of talking when no one can/is gonna/ is willing to understand. When I know people don't understand, I need not to ""open up"" before it gonna hurt all of us: sometimes it's because I love them too much (my friends) or sometimes I just wanna spare myself some BS like ""It Is Just A Phase/ You must deal with it all by yourself/ Cheer Up, it's not the end of the world""."
depression,eypcvlc,t3_cxvb2w,1567296484.0,"Me too. I have made so many mistakes that I reach  the point where I'm too scare to move. I am indeed a coward. People tell me so too. 
Right now I'm so tired. I feel empty and I can't see the point of trying anymore. I wish I wasn't born."
depression,eyj0wdc,t3_cx4y2k,1567110575.0,"Same here. I sleep because I couldn't bare staying awake: especially at the moment I feel like everything's too much to handle - I'm easily overwhelmed and I'm always on the verge of breaking down.
The hours I spend sleeping in one day get longer and longer and everytime I go to sleep I hope I never have to wake up again."
