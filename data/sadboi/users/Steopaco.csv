SuicideWatch,fa9knn3,t3_e83l4j,1575877801.0,I know how you feel. I’m at my end right now. Trying to figure out what to do because I don’t want to live anymore. I tried to wake up my boyfriend 3x already to have him bring me to the hospital but he seems like he doesn’t care and goes back to sleep. I’m just sitting here crying waiting for a sign to tell me what to do.
