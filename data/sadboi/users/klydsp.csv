JUSTNOFAMILY,fmgutka,t3_fv34mi,1586058412.0,"Omg my nmom did the exact. Same. Thing.

I blocked her on all social media and even disabled my own account because she kept stealing my pictures and making it her primary photo. Her and my dad divorced a few years back because she cheated on him and then she started hoeing it up online like the D was gonna be out of stock as quickly as toilet paper. She used my picture to lure these poor old guys in. We have the same platinum blonde hair but she's much heavier than me. When I was in my early 20s or late teens, most people thought we were sisters. 
When I saw she was using my pic to catfish men I lost it. I haven't talked to her I  almost 2 years. 
The point is that even though she is your mom, she is not looking out for your best interest or respecting basic boundaries. You shouldnt even have to explain to her why this is wrong, but her level of basic human kindness is so twisted that talking most likely won't do much in the long run. What she did is horrible, and she probably wouldn't have used another person's picture like a friend but she chose yours because she knew you were pretty and she got kicks out of the attention, plus the fact that if you found out it wouldn't be that horrible, after all she is your mother. In her eyes you're automatically supposed to forgive and look up to her.
