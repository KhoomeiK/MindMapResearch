AskGirls,fqsjqsm,t3_g5cgnw,1589609224.0,"If I like the guy's personality, I start liking everything about him. Lol. 

But,
What I generally like in a guy are his EYES, smile, VOICE, SHOULDERS, arms, his walk.

I never looked at a guy's thighs before. But this one dude, damn. Idk why but he has very good thighs.

Also, I like men with a good back, hands, chest. Lol, that just means basically everything I guess. 

But most importantly, it's about the way he makes me feel. You could be the hottest guy around but if I don't feel anything, I won't care."

NJTech,fq8u4un,t3_ghh34e,1589175592.0,"I'm sorry that this has been your experience. I can totally understand. Hope you and your family stay safe. 
But I also read a lot of posts and I wouldn't be surprised if this was a strategy to make sure that a lot of people are forced to retake their current classes. This way they get to make more money off of the current students. 
In a time where people are going through major life changes including mental health issues and financial issues due to literally everything happening around us, I'm shocked that professors are actually spending so much time to literally trap students. 
People are worried about their well being and are trying to just get by. 
Our grades should not be more important than our fucking life."
WeightLossAdvice,fq5b289,t3_ggvlm4,1589098656.0,"I'm 25. All my life I was trying to lose weight for others. And lost it and gained it back again. Even at my lowest, people would always compliment me but I never felt good. Instead I hated how people started liking me because of my looks and not because of who I really was. 


Now I have people who like me because of who I really am. Just the way I am. 


Last week, without telling or asking anyone (which I always do) I just bought a weighing scale for myself. Turns out I am the same weight I was 2 years ago. I'm glad that I haven't crossed that weight. I even paid for an app to track my eating habits without consulting anyone. Only because I wanted to. I feel more secure in who I am now. The difference is that I'm more confident now. I already like myself and want to get better. I feel relieved now. I'm not stressed. I'm not in a rush. I'm doing it for myself. To become healthier and more confident. And also because I have a great sense of style but I can't wear all those pretty clothes. So I just wanna lose weight and wear all those super cute outfits that I've always dreamed of wearing. 


So yeah, do it for yourself. With a personal goal in mind. Don't put a time limit. Just imagine that 'You' you want to be and stay positive. 


And most importantly, don't put too much pressure on yourself. You're just a teenager. You have your whole life ahead of you. Your life's goal is not just losing weight. You are gonna do so many amazing things in life that have absolutely nothing to do with your looks.


Try focusing on all your amazing, unique qualities other than your looks. Your looks are not the only appealing thing about you. 
So relax and stay positive."

depression,forkmu5,t3_g90794,1588013821.0,"I don't know if this is categorized as severe or not. 
But I've had these issues for a few years now. 
I have huge memory issues too!
I lose my train of thought all the time if someone or something interrupts me. And then my anxiety kicks in and I talk fast and loud before anyone can interrupt me. 

Since I was a kid, if the TV was loud or if I felt that a lot was happening at the same time, I used to get an instant headache and scream out of fear. Sometimes, even have tremors and then leave the room. 

Getting out of bed has always been a big problem for me. And also showering. It's not that I don't like showering. I do, cz hot water helps with my migraines. But most of the time, I physically have no energy to get up and shower. It takes me atleast an hour to be mentally awake. 

Also, I get very very easily confused. If a lot is happening at the same time, I can't think. I freak out. It is very difficult for me to make quick decisions. And react quickly. 

I have been blocking several bad years of my life in my mind. And now it's to the point that I don't even randomly remember a lot of people and my life from 2 years ago. When someone mentions something from even a year ago, it takes me some time to remember it. 

At my absolutely worst depressive state in 2017, I wanted to get better and decided to take as many pictures as possible to remember and think of small happy moments like sunrises, trees, coffee etc. And be present in the moment. And I've been doing that ever since. 

But on the flip side, when something bad happens or someone hurts me in the present, I obsess over it and forget about all the good times or the good things that people did in the past. And every small thing seems like the end of the world. 

But now, I still don't actively remember good times unless I look at all these pictures on my phone and even then, I get a very different, surprised feeling as if...wow...I did that/ went there? That was amazing... It feels like watching a movie about my own life. 

I don't know how to solve this issue either. But I feel it's not that severe. These are just the after effects of the coping mechanisms I embraced during my fight/ survival stage. And now, there is no need for these coping mechanisms as my present is different now. 

Sorry I wrote a lot. Lol. Hope this helps."
newjersey,fooh5m2,t1_foog9hc,1587938880.0,Yeah...it's all super confusing rn. Nothing makes sense anymore. Hope it all works out for you tho. üëçIdk much about off campus but I've heard that there are cheaper places in Harrison and Kearny.
newjersey,foog5z7,t1_foofsih,1587938361.0,That sucks. I'm sorry. Then getting your own place would be the best option.
newjersey,foofmn9,t1_fojuvkl,1587938089.0,You can tell Reslife about this in detail. And you can work for housing compensation. So you'll be living and working on campus till 31st July. Worth a shot
depression,fomy4w9,t3_g86q9d,1587907353.0,Just got done ugly crying an hour ago. But I would still cry if someone asks me why my eyes are swollen.
narcissisticparents,fomxib1,t3_g8cz12,1587906842.0,"I have experienced most of these things. 

I just had a lengthy, crying, conversation with my dad an hour ago, talking about narcissism and he didn't know what it was. He has been dealing with my mom's behavior for the sake of my brother (also narcissistic) and I. When I told him the traits and sent him links, he said, now it all makes sense. He didn't know there was a term for it. My dad and I have always been shamed by my mom and brother for having depression.

I didn't know what was happening till now either. I was (am?) The scapegoat for both my mom and brother. I've been blaming myself all my life. I was confused and felt like the bad guy just like you.

But once you accept that it's not your fault, it will get better. Once you accept that none of those things had anything to do with you and it was her issue, it will get better. Often we blame ourselves. Please, don't do that. Talking to a professional would help. 

Something that I've recently started doing is identifying if a thought is my personal thought or a trauma reaction. That helps you eliminate such thoughts. 
Hope this helps. Stay strong."
NJTech,fohkuo0,t3_g7fax3,1587767643.0,"I'm doing MS Business and Information Systems. It's a STEM program. I didn't take any classes at the School of Management at NJIT. But I took two classes at the Rutgers Business School, Newark. And it was a great experience. It felt a lot more like a Business school with several associations, meetups and other related resources. The classes I took were with executive MBA students, so there's also a possibility for networking. 
But, I LOVE NJIT. My STEM classes are great. And because Njit is a smaller school, it is personally a great experience. NJIT has amazing professors as well. I took a Corporate Finance class with Professor Fox. Great Professor. The class is challenging if you don't like math. Otherwise, an easy A. And I've heard great things about our School of Management. And most importantly, if you're interested in finance, we have the Bloomberg desktops in our lab. Great resource! For Free! 
So it would depend on what you want to do after college."
Anxietyhelp,fnrh8i6,t3_g3g9ag,1587188876.0,"When the quarantine started, I had a panic attack. I love being ""busy"" cz it keeps me away from spiraling.  I was scared of being alone cz I knew that I'd be alone with my thoughts and that was super scary. 

I slept way too much, didn't eat and my friend used to call me everyday to check up on me. I felt the need to talk to people as much as possible so I wouldn't be alone with my mind. Distracting myself as much as possible. I would listen to music even while taking the trash out. The only time I wouldn't have headphones on would be while sleeping. 

But I started dealing with my shit and started journaling and meditating. And started reading more. It was difficult. A lot of crying was involved. But eventually I felt lighter. 


And I haven't been interested in staying connected with anyone cz now I feel slightly relaxed. And don't feel the need to distract myself all the time. Now I don't feel the need to keep music on to distract myself from my thoughts. I even went on walks without my headphones on. 


Now the flip side is, I also have depression. 
My parents call me everyday. It's an Indian thing. But lately I don't feel like talking to them either. And that is unusual for me. So now I'm kinda scared of slipping into my depression again. 


I guess it's more about a balance?! 
Maybe a good amount of social contact with ample me-time as well. 
Also, try to get enough sleep and eat right. 
Hope this helps. Stay safe and take care!"
wholesomememes,fnoze07,t3_g30brt,1587136477.0,"Sometimes I think it's my mind telling me to be cautious in case shit goes down. But I've learnt that it's just conditioning. And also, fear."
Anxiety,fnk6ksh,t1_fnk00yb,1587016504.0,"Exactly. People without anxiety might not understand that it's not just ""worrying about something"". It ends up affecting all parts of your life like Academics, Relationships, Self esteem etc. 
 I'm bubbly and talkative around friends. But only my closest friends know how my mind works. And are there to help me.
It doesn't mean I'm putting on a fake personality. Just that not everyone deserves to know everything.  
I'm scared that if people know, they will tag it as ""being bummed out"". And stereotype me."
Anxiety,fnk5r9c,t3_g21eua,1587015785.0,"I identify with this completely. I have anxiety to the point that going to class is a struggle. It's a breakdown of small tasks like showering, getting ready making breakfast and so on.

And even after everything on the list is checked off, I usually wander/ panic around the room thinking I've forgotten something or something is wrong and I'm not ready to leave out the door yet. Always second guessing. Then finally, I leave and find out that I'm already late. 

I'm usually always late to everything. People think it's rude. But sometimes, even when I am ready way before time, my anxiety gets the best of me and I try to calm myself down which then takes more time and then I'm late again. 

Also, texting!!!!! Argh!!! I've had so many incidents where I have miscommunicated with my friends and had arguments over text only because we misunderstood each other. And I have to think for two minutes before I send a text and figure out the appropriate response before hitting send. And even after that, I panic if they take too long or leave me on read and I spiral into thinking that I just ended my entire friendship with them. 

And anxiety + depression is a f*cked up combo. 
I'm both unmotivated and hyper at the same time. Idek how. 

TL;DR: anxiety affects basic tasks that people without anxiety cannot relate to."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fnbjqe2,t3_g0of0i,1586816756.0,I compliment my male friends all the time. But I didn't know that men actually take compliments seriously. I used to think they don't care unless it's from someone they're interested in.
