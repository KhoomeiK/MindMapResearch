PanicAttack,foid7bn,t3_g7hu5e,1587783937.0,"Once in the downward spiral, it's hard to escape it.  Mind over matter, literally . You could spend months trying to figure out what your triggers are but it won't help you because you'll feel like you're gaining some sense of control over this but once you realize that there isn't really any form of control at all because no matter how much you change your diet or avoid your supposed triggers, the panic attack will return when you least expect it.  

The best thing to do is start therapy, learn all you can about it, and practice acceptance as well as meditation.  I've found exercise also works for me long term.  I've had panic disorder for over 15 years and I've been on medication for 14 of those years.  I have good years and bad years .  :)"

Since then when I take one, I just let it do its thing and I divert my attention elsewhere and before I know it I'm not having a panic attack anymore.  I'm also sensitive to medication so when I first took it I felt this odd warm sensation go through my body, kinds like when you get a cat scan and they put dye in your iv?

Anyways I wouldn't half the already halved dose.  I take half of mine also but halving the half would be.... Madness lol.  And it probably wouldnt do anything for you."

Or our cave man portion of our brain believing we are in dsnger so what you're afraid of is actually a normal reaction to danger.  If you relax you will tell that portion of your brain that everything is good and you're in no danger.  That's a skill that has to be honed however and isn't something that you develop over night."

panicdisorder,ff1uy97,t3_eodiw5,1579486755.0,I love coffee too.  I went a whole year just drinking one cup in the morning.  Just recently added an afternoon cup and so far so good.  I do sometimes get a little twitchy from the afternoon cup but I will say that yeah if you're having panic attacks a lot right now then you should limit that and sugar intake.
panicdisorder,ff1ur2t,t3_eohs7g,1579486633.0,I've read that once you have a large one it's very easy to get stuck in a constant panic loop cycle... like your nerves are more sensitive to whatever is causing the panic attack so you have more of them.

panicdisorder,ff1ui6i,t1_fed7ogl,1579486477.0,Ugh this is why I only take xanax during really bad ones.
panicdisorder,ff1udkp,t3_eohs7g,1579486394.0,Yep.  And usually smaller ones will ensue if I dont find a way to calm down.  I've read that one cant remain in a continuous panic attack state though as the body wouldn't be ae to produce that much adrenalin for that long.  I guess that is one silver lining in the cloud... knowing that eventually your body will be too exhausted to have a panic attack.
