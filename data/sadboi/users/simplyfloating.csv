So glad I have another brother/sister in Christ! Welcome to the family!"

depression,f11us79,t3_d7foof,1569130825.0,"I like the title lmao

I'm so sorry though. Last year I felt similar, and many years before that. Some days I still do. I used to just sit and fantasize about ending it and how much of a relief it would be but I couldn't because I had people who love me and it would crush and ruin their lives. 

Don't feel guilty. You aren't trying to hurt them, you're just trying to get some relief. 

I didn't think it'd ever end. I'm diagnosed with several things I thought would control my life so what was really the point. My life eventually changed though and I'm happy. I truly didn't see anything but black. I started just doing shit like stealing kinda hoping I'd get caught and thrown in prison cause I had no direction but also kinda as a fuck you to everyone I was stealing from because I was angry and yeah. I was just so so angry. I wanted other people to be angry too. What I didn't realize was it would get better. I mean, you never really can know that it will but when it does you think, ""how did I not see this as a possibility"". 

I'm sorry I'm kind of rambling, the point I was trying to make is don't be done fighting, keep fighting! Man there is so much for you out there. I was done. I had been dealt a shit hand when it came to my mental state of mind. I was ready to go out into a field and end it at some points. I knew where, I knew how. 

Then I found joy man. I found joy in the darkest places. In places it shouldn't have been but it was. I never expected it. I say keeping fighting because I believe that joy can be found by you even in your darkest places. Those so much to life I continue to see and it fills me up to the brim with just happiness. If I could find it truly anyone can. I'll be praying for you."

Christianity,f0j2b1o,t3_d51eh0,1568650198.0,"I think God simply listened to your request and calmed your soul. Nothing more complicated then that.

I know what you mean about liking to be sad and keeping suicide as a comfort because it means you have an escape option if stuff gets too hard. I was like that a couple years ago and still struggle with the comfort of suicide as my escape. The thing is once you’ve thought a certain way for so long it becomes a habit and naturally comforts you whether it’s healthy or not. You know suicide will always be there.

Don’t live that way anymore. Try to break that habit. I am a strong believer in medication as it is what keeps my life stable but I also believe that if you have a childlike faith (another way of saying if you have a simple faith) in God peace will be given to you like you experienced in this post.

Matthew 18:2-4 “He called a little child to him, and placed the child among them. 3 And he said: “Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 4 Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.”

You are anxious about leaving your anxiousness behind because you think if you do you will face the real world and become even more anxious. The word of God speaks about this.

Philippians 4:6-7 Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

Don’t you see? You prayed and the peace of God which passes all understanding came upon you! 

Matthew 6:25-34 Therefore I say unto you, Be not anxious for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than the food, and the body than the raiment? 26 Behold the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not ye of much more value than they? 27 And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto [a]the measure of his life? 28 And why are ye anxious concerning raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: 29 yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 30 But if God doth so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? 31 Be not therefore anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? 32 For after all these things do the Gentiles seek; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. 33 But seek ye first his kingdom, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. 34 Be not therefore anxious for the morrow: for the morrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.

Whether God is telling you through prayer or telling you through me, let it be know that you are called to no longer let anxiousness have a hold on your life. The Lord is calling you. Simply listen to his voice and all will be given to you."
Christianity,f0iyw2e,t3_d4s2ld,1568648860.0,"Deuteronomy 31:6 Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you

This baby is a blessing. Keep it, it will bring joy to your life. You say yourself you want it but are scared. Don’t be. God has not forsaken you. Have faith, that’s all that is required. Have the simple faith that God will provide for you and your child and all will be given to you.

John 16:33 I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.

There is no challenge for God to provide for you. It does not matter whether you slept with a man or not. He does not care as long as you trust in his son. Jesus has already washed away your sins. Get up! Why are you still sad? The son of God had washed away your sins and made you clean! That is something to celebrate!

There will be challenges ahead and consequences to your actions that result in those challenges but that still means nothing to God. If you ask you shall receive. All you have to do is ask , child of God. Just call on his name and let him handle the rest through your faith.

Matthew 7:7 Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you"
StarWars,f0gzt2u,t1_f0g345y,1568609781.0,a good summary but by the time Ezra finds Maul in the sith ruins maul has been stranded for years. i think Solo was going to cover some key points as to how Maul ended up in the state he was in all alone with nothing when Ezra found him. By that time Mayl no longer had the empire. Maybe he possibly dropped it long ago to try to find the sith holocron and find Obi Wans location but he was no long involved in the syndicate

later i found out people liked me man. i was the one telling myself they didn’t like me. 

you feel awkward and weird and insecure? good! maybe you’re an awkward and quirky person. own that shit man! if you’re kind of awkward and quirky so what! you have an interesting personality! my dad is really quirky and sometimes awkward but let me tel you that is the best part about who he is. he has such a good heart and his dumb but funny jokes will never grow old. he’s not smooth socially at all but i wouldn’t trade that man for the world. same with some of my other friends.

maybe you struggle with being awkward and it feels like everyone else doesn’t but they’re struggling with other stuff too. for a time i struggled with just being a huge asshole. id take being awkward anyway over trying not to be a jerk and open myself up. 

you seem like a genuine and great guy. don’t sell yourself short. own your awkwardness and quirkiness man! in my opinion those are great character traits. you got this and dont overthink it. your personality is what makes you who you are and clearly the girl ur dating and ur friends see that"

don’t focus on that stuff. don’t look in the mirror as often. just give yourself a break. it’ll be really hard at first. your more then just ur body. you’re a person. you are defined but your actions and character. you think people remember the famous people that defined the world in history books by how they looked? no, you are far more important then that. so is everyone. you have character and personality and honestly if you let it show you don’t even need good looks.
