This is good advice.

The thing that most helped me be able to do a pull up though was losing all the excess weight I had as a kid.  It’s a no brainer that less excess weight (fat) makes it easier to do body weight exercises.

Also, you can resistance bands to add varying degrees of assistance (if you’ve got enough height just loop it up the top and step onto it.  If height is as issue you put your knees on/in it.  This works so much better than assisted pull up machines)

Also, a personal anecdote.  On all pulling exercises except deadlifts, I find using a suicide grip (thumbs out) really aids in activating the back and reducing bicep activation...you may need straps to do this if your grip strength is lacking BUT that’s okay...grip work can be done separately."

You are an idiot.

Let’s review.

- 30 free incense in one box

- free poke balls and buries in other boxes

- incense lasts an hour and has increased spawn rate

- a community day you could do entirely from home and get an insane amount of Pokémon and shinies...using said free hour long incense.  Plus your buddy brought you 50 (or 51 or 52) FREE pokeballs as a gift every half hour.

- remote raids implemented and three free remote raid passes given.

- removed walking requirement from GBL do everyone could do their 5 rounds a day.

- your buddy brings you gifts to send to friends without you having to leave the house.

- gifts contain increased numbers of pokeballs.  (Like so much so that if you have a decent number of in game friends you should never run out)

- QoL changes that we have been hoping for for years.

There is much more they have done since this pandemic started but let’s all forget that and whinge they are charging less than a dollar for remote raid passes.  

It’s not their fault if you have nothing else to do but play Pokémon go all day every day.  They have done, and are still doing, more than enough to allow people to play the game for free AND for $2.50 a day you can do three remote raids if you choose.  

So year, sure, making your free daily pass a remote raid pass during this period WOULD be great...but don’t use hyperbole to try and say they haven’t done a tonne of work to let players keep playing for free."

It means health authorities being able to identify people you’ve come in contact with that are at risk of getting the virus if you have the virus.

It’s virtually impossible once the number of cases gets too high where the point of infection isn’t known (i.e: community transmission with no known source).  It takes a lot of work to do proper contact tracing without digital tools (see below).

China had to shut down for 30 days (or was it more?) so that they could start again with an almost blank slate and do proper contact tracing of cases...the initial outbreak in Wuhan got out of control before they had fhe capability.  They use an (mandatory) App on people’s phones to identify who was in contact with an unknowingly infected person.

Australia has a similar App now that is voluntary.  In order for it to be effective I think we need at least 40% of the population to download and install it on their phones.  I haven’t installed it as I am very concerned about it’s implications for the future."
