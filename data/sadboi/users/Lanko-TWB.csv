WritingPrompts,fqoufa4,t3_gk03y6,1589525180.0,"I’ve never done one of these, I’m bored in a pandemic so why not. I failed English in 9th grade so please go easy on me if my grammar and punctuation is atrocious. 

It’s been 2 years. Ever since my 17th birthday the voice just wouldn’t stop. I tried telling my parents about it but they just sent me to some shitty therapist across the street from my school. After a couple sessions he was convinced I had schizophrenia. Although this prognosis didn’t come as much of a surprise, it rattled every fiber of my being. I was referred to a psych and they put me on some meds. They said it would make the voice stop. It didn’t stop. After about a year of therapy and switching between an assortment of meds I’d accepted the fact this voice wasn’t gonna go away. I tried meditating, EMDR, hypnosis. None of it worked. After some time I came to be friends with this voice. If I was going to have this fucker in my head I might as well make it someone easier, right? Well, another year passed and I was diagnosed with cancer of the brain. They told me someone as young as I would have a good chance of survival, around 50% or so. I just turned 19 not to long ago. I’m not ready to die. I want to get married. Have kids. Finish college. Try some drugs or something I don’t fucking know. What I do know is within the next 5-10 years there’s only about a 50% chance I get to experience anything of the sorts. They told me it was only one tumor, but it was big. They could try to remove it but want to try shrinking it with chemo. I knew it was going to be hard on my body but if it meant possibly surviving this shit show I was willing to do it. My first appointment did not go well, it hurt like hell. I was told this was abnormal and sharp excruciating pain was worrying. Afterwards we decided to keep trying as some pain was worth a chance at life. But it happened every time. I felt weaker and weaker after every appointment. I was told this was normal, cells in my body were being destroyed after all. But the excruciating pain never ceased to stop happening. After a year of chemo the doctors told me the tumor had shrunk to a reasonable size. They were ready to remove it. I spent a week or so getting ready. Telling my family I love them in case it goes wrong. All the good stuff. I’d never had to have surgery before so they briefed me on the whole “going under” thing. It was scary but I was ready. The voice had stopped responding to me. It seemed like it was acting like a didn’t exist. I’m ok with that. He was still there, he just ignored me. That brings us to now. They gave me some drug to put me under and said it would take a second. My body wasn’t moving and the voice was gone. But I’m wide awake. I am terrified out of my mind. This doesn’t seem normal. They’re cutting out a chunk of my brain, I can feel it. This is a million times worse than the chemo ever was. Please make it stop. Why can’t they hear me. They’re saying they’re almost done. When will it sto.

Sorry for terrible formatting, I’m on mobile and really don’t want to get on my laptop to fix it. This was fun to write. If you want to learn more about EMDR here’s a link :) I also appreciate feedback, I want to do more of these and really want to improve.
