Anxietyhelp,fo8lk14,t1_fo3ztbn,1587598931.0,Yes! I force mine away for my husband’s sake too but my anxiety was so bad this past weekend I was either taking a million showers (one distraction technique) or crying in my hallway. It got him super anxious too. I’m not sure if being candid helps or not but I’ve reached out to friends and old colleagues.
feemagers,fo8kujg,t3_g49i9g,1587598526.0,Oh man! I was diagnosed with GAD and Depression in my mid twenties (late 30s now). I had gone to therapy and did really well with the CBT and learned techniques that got me off the meds and managing pretty well for a few years until this March when Covid came up. Turns out I developed a phobia of Covid that started my anxiety back up and all my old techniques stopped working. I’ve started back on medication and therapy. It’s starting back at step one but I know that I can get over this again.  I just have to remind myself of that every day.
Anxiety,fnu4bl2,t3_fo6h6w,1587254284.0,"100% me. I started crying reading this and it’s oddly comforting. I’ve been struggling and today was a particularly bad day. I’m not sure why, it just is. I’ve been staying away from the news and other triggers but I still spend a lot of my days with the tightness in my chest. My husband, love him, tells me it’s all in my head and I can control it. Babe, if I could I would. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy."
