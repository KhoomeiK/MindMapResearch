india,fmaq9w0,t1_flubas9,1585903530.0,"On your website, ""Should I wear a mask? No."" I think WHO have changed their stance on this. Not only if you're symptomatic now, but also as a precautionary measure they've been advising everyone to wear the mask. According to WHO if 80% of the people wear mask, the outbreak will stop immediately.  
But since the masks and equipment are in such less quantity, they're also advising people in DIY masks using cotton and stuff at home. You should read about it and make the necessary changes. 
EDIT: PIB issued a pdf suggesting people to wear masks and how to make one, here is it https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=200833"

And bran too knew he would become The King, because in today's episode he says, Why do you think I came all the way? But then what's the meaning related to being memory of the world? And do you think he talked to Tyrion about all of this in the little meeting they had earlier this season?"
