depression,fb3fjee,t3_eb0ggo,1576471684.0,This hit way too close to home. I’ll often be going about my day and all of a sudden I remember something sad; a few months ago I would’ve started crying and contemplates suicide. Now I just think to myself “only fifty more years to go” and I’m grateful that life does t last forever.
