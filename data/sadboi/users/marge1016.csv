bipolar,fmqzjha,t1_fmqlt29,1586310469.0,I cut my Klonopin too. I was at a really low dose so it was easy to wean off of it.
BipolarReddit,fmqysz1,t3_fwvlil,1586310014.0,Momâ€™s are the best! Happy Birthday ðŸŽ‰
bipolar,fkj7k3r,t1_fkdffcj,1584238261.0,Proud of you.
bipolar,fk8kez2,t1_fk8c4ir,1583957727.0,No problem and thanks! Wishing you well too.
BipolarReddit,fk81rc3,t1_fk7ynv7,1583947728.0,Iâ€™m really happy with the stability I have now so I havenâ€™t brought it up with my doctor.
BipolarReddit,fk7xzww,t1_fk1eokf,1583945715.0,Iâ€™m just lucky Iâ€™m currently on Medicaid so I donâ€™t have to cover the cost of my Latuda. My doctor does have to certify me very couple of months. Latuda is a life saver.
BipolarReddit,fk7ujkh,t3_fg0y0d,1583943888.0,My libido has been barely there for a while now. Iâ€™m on two medications which are reported to not  affect it but itâ€™s decreased dramatically.
BipolarReddit,fk5tmu3,t3_fgkl77,1583887649.0,Trazodone did nothing for me. My doctor put me on Klonopin which worked but I got off of it because itâ€™s a benzo and I didnâ€™t want to have to always rely on it to sleep. Now Iâ€™m sleeping okay without racing thoughts.
BipolarReddit,fk5svch,t3_fghum2,1583887221.0,As most people say meds affect everyone differently. I was on Abilify which seemed okay for a few weeks and then I switched to the Abilify injection and things went downhill. I ended up back in the hospital for depression/suicidal ideation.
bipolar,fk325i3,t1_fk2zq3g,1583815302.0,"You might have to go through the whole process again to find something that really works for you.

I was on Abilify and it worked while I was taking the pills but when I switched to the injection things went downhill. I was on it for three months and it ended with me being hospitalized for depression and suicidal ideation. I worked with my psychiatrist after the hospitalization to get on the right meds and I found Latuda and Lamictal. Iâ€™ve been stable for about 8 months now."
bipolar,fk2env4,t3_ffu334,1583799364.0,I'm on 200mg and it's working well for me. I tapered down from 250mg. I take it with an antipsychotic Latuda.
bipolar1,fjzvs1t,t3_edi5s8,1583731064.0,I take it and so far so good but Iâ€™m also on Latuda an antipsychotic. My mood has been pretty stable since I got prescribed these meds.
bipolar1,fjzjx6g,t3_f5v0f9,1583721486.0,Iâ€™m BP1 with psychotic features and I had one major manic episode before my diagnosis. Iâ€™m pretty sure it was Stage III.
bipolar,fjv6v92,t3_feuvj0,1583623694.0,Iâ€™m definitely at a 2. Last year I was at 7-8 and my psychiatrist put me back in inpatient which helped stop the suicidal ideation but I was still extremely depressed. I went to a partial hospital program and the psychiatrist there got me on a good combination of meds. Iâ€™ve been stable with no episodes or ideation.
BipolarReddit,fjhgpnw,t3_fd3j9e,1583347782.0,Good luck.
BipolarReddit,fjh764o,t3_fcv8un,1583342551.0,You can do this. (BP 1) I stopped drinking before my first hospitalization and once doctors told me alcohol messes with meds I wasnâ€™t trying to see what happens. Iâ€™m on Lamictal as well with Latuda.
BipolarReddit,fjfc11b,t1_fj2q1a4,1583288652.0,Thatâ€™s exactly what Iâ€™ve been thinking. I also take Latuda which doesnâ€™t seem to have the same effect so I think Iâ€™d be able to take that.
BipolarReddit,fjfayrk,t1_fj1enua,1583288024.0,Everyoneâ€™s journey is different and it takes time to find the right combo. Itâ€™s been little over a year and Iâ€™m on my fourth Med. I went through the first 3 meds in my first 6months. I also took several meds for sleep ending up with Klonopin which I stopped last year. I just take Latuda and Lamictal now and Iâ€™ve been stable.
AmItheAsshole,fjbc5gp,t3_fcexfv,1583190222.0,NTA your husband should prep his own meals. Putting all this work on you is unfair.

bipolar,fj0pxal,t3_fatd31,1582905339.0,That happened to me too. First it was Zyprexa and it made me gain weight and then I switched to Abilify. Abilify worked like a month and then I went into a really bad depression and they put me on Invega which was not working. Then I got on Latuda and Lamictal which took a bit of time but Iâ€™m stable.
bipolar,fizfrre,t1_fiz4r5m,1582861681.0,Thatâ€™s how I feel about Latuda and Lamictal.
bipolar,fizf9of,t3_fallle,1582861314.0,Happy Bipolar 2! When I got my diagnosis of Bipolar 1 it put things into perspective. Itâ€™s been just over a year since I got diagnosed and now I want to make a cake :)
