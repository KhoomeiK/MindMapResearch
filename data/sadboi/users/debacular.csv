It sounds like you need a steady roof above your head. Do you have enough money for an apartment deposit? Did you check craigslist for shared rooms or living spaces? Even if you’re in a closet somewhere you need that address.

Once you have a physical address, you should try to get in with a regular doctor, as well as a psychiatrist. If you have trouble finding one that will take new patients, try to look online for telemedicine providers. These are doctors who video chat with patients and they’re usually easier to get in with. They should be able to provide a general assessment, and may be well positioned to advise you about health including mental health.

Also look on reddit for homeless advice subreddits and living on little. This website is a treasure trove for information like that.

I’m sure we live in very different worlds, but mental health affects us all, no matter where we live in this globe or what other life factors are at play.

My therapist tells me to try to take care of my mind, body, and soul. So for me it’s important to pay attention to all three. If you’re able to, you could meditate or do puzzles for your mind. Exercise or do some sports for your body. And faith/religion/spirituality for your soul. For me, whenever I let one of my areas slip up I usually start to struggle again and I have to remind myself to do these things on a daily basis.

Do you have something you could do to help your mind/body/soul? Which one of these areas is hurting the most? Which is strongest? If you’re really in shape or good at sports, but suffer from a mental illness, you could try exercise to help balance out your mind, for example.

Also, I will say. I like to get my head out of itself and clear it up with what I call a “blank slate meditation”. It’s just sitting and observing and processing whatever thoughts arise.

Did you confess your pride yet in a confession?

After confession the answer for me seems to be to not think as much about myself, but instead think about others. Whenever you’re in a situation with someone, think about how your thoughts, words, and actions affect them. Not out of a selfish desire to conquer pride, but out of a genuine heartfelt concern for the other person’s wellbeing.

The good deeds must be done without any expectation of anything in return. Give freely with your palms open. Think nothing of yourself (not good or bad)."

What to do? Be available to listen if you can, but try not to feed the delusions. Try to get him to see a doctor. If he’s ever at risk of hurting himself or others then obviously call the police and tell them what you know about him and the situation. The police should be able to deescalate.

If you want to help him then he needs medical attention. Voluntary commitment is probably preferable. It’s tricky though because the delusions are all internally consistent and seem logically coherent, but are based on a flawed assumption. So it all seems very real to him."

Catholicism,fmbuo9h,t1_fmbqg7y,1585933536.0,"Thank you, I’ll be the first to admit that I have been misled before, and I appreciate your concern. I do believe God has a plan and have felt Him in my life.

I have no friends in the Catholic Church. I am basically posting here to try to find some, especially during these times. I guess that’s why I commented because I felt for OP.

I am sorry if I offended."
Catholicism,fmbi2c5,t1_fmbfah7,1585926788.0,"Okay, I will try to change your mind.

I believe that God gives us each instructions for our lives and we have to listen to our hearts to hear it. Like OP.

My instructions include practicing Catholicism as best as I can. I don’t think we all have to be the same type of faith to experience the fullness of God’s love, and just as God’s love can take on many different forms, I believe so can our salvation.

I am not one to judge. And I don’t know that anyone is really out of God’s reach and unable to be saved if they stray from their instructions. All I’m saying is this: no matter your path in life, love is the answer. And God’s love is the ultimate answer."
Catholicism,fmbb8ru,t3_fu7wxd,1585922779.0,"I will pray for you and others who are awaiting their first sacraments.

I believe we are all together in spirit, whether Catholic, Baptist, Jewish, Muslim, agnostic, atheist, or anything else. I’m sorry you have lost so much on your spiritual path, but you are staying true to your calling and God will reward you. I hope the people who were close to you will eventually respect your decision and find the common love in all faiths.

This too will pass. There will be a time for celebration. I look forward to the day we can look back and see where we showed each other love and friendship during this trying time."

Regardless of intent, a problem with lumping one idea in with others is it’s less likely to keep the discussion on track. Hence my calling you out..."
