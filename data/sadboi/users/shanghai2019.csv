depression,fnb4tr6,t3_g0b70h,1586809229.0,"I think I fall mostly into that category, but it does build on itself- beyond chemistry. The thought processes are perpetuated by the chemistry. I’m not sure you can entirely separated the biological side and the emotional side. They necessarily go together. 

I had some major medical trauma throughout all my teenage years, and I’ve dealt with depression ever since. Even once the trauma resolved itself and when things were good in life. I’ve been in therapy for years now, and have tried so many medications. But the first time I got put on a dopamine antagonist... it was like magic. Within three weeks I was improving significantly. Granted, it’s some hardcore stuff with some nasty side affects, but my body’s response to this medication firms up in my mind that a lot of my depression is biological."
depression,fm9n7t2,t1_fm8jomf,1585872216.0,"I think if you’re seeing a psychiatrist, seeing a therapist is a good idea too. Your therapist is going to have better perspective on how medicine is helping/doing nothing/hurting you. I saw a therapist for years before she finally was able to convince me to see a psychiatrist. I don’t think I would’ve made the improvement I have made if I didn’t have both of them. For me, therapy wasn’t enough, but medication alone wouldn’t have been enough either."
depression,fm9mua5,t3_ftl2ty,1585871995.0,"I saw a psychiatrist for the first time about a year and a half ago (should’ve gone like...4 years before that, but anyway...). The first one I saw wasn’t a great fit, but he was still able to get me headed in the right direction until I was able to find someone that I felt more comfortable with. I’m doing better than I have been in years, and I have both psychiatrists- the one I didn’t like and the one I do like- to thank."

depression,flo5ytw,t3_fq1u7t,1585332226.0,"I think a lot of us know exactly what you mean— or at least understand what that feels like in our own lives. 

Your doctor is right about therapy. I think it’s a really important piece of healing/surviving/thriving for the vast majority of people. I also recommend seeing a therapist in-person, but that’s not super practical in any way right now. Maybe check out some of the online therapy services. I think that’s definitely better than nothing. You’ll have someone to hear you out, help you put perspective on things, and help you develop some coping skills that will, hopefully, ease your panic attacks. I was having full-blown panic attacks daily a couple years ago too. I finally got on the right combo of medicine and have done a lot of work in therapy. Happy to say it’s been months since my last bad panic attack. 

If COVID news is stressing you out even more, take a break from the news and social media. You can control what and how much your exposed to in that regard. Take ownership of that piece of your mental health if necessary."

depression,fjp8lon,t3_fentif,1583544510.0,"I love writing/reading poetry. I recommend Jane Kenyon’s “Having It Out With Melancholy” if you’re looking for some to read. Mary Oliver has also been so good to me during this episode of depression. Keep writing, even if you think it’s sucks. It’s good to express yourself and makes you feel like you done something- anything. 

As for the pain thing, yes. I understand that. Pain feels like something, and my depression feels like absolute nothingness."

depression,fg288sd,t3_evzrls,1580440314.0,"One of my favorite little poems is by Jane Kenyon if the collection called *Having it Out with Melancholy* where she writes about her experience with mental illness. She wrote this one about her dog—

“The dog searches until he finds me 
upstairs, lies down with a clatter 
of elbows, puts his head on my foot.

Sometimes the sound of his breathing 
saves my life—in and out, in 
and out; a pause, a long sigh. . . . “"
depression,fg27pl4,t1_fg1blvk,1580440068.0,"I’d been seeing my therapist for a good year and a half, and she’d been telling me I needed to see a different psychiatrist the entire time. It took me so long to actually do it, but she was there each week to help me shutdown the shame and stigma I’d put around needing a different doc. It took 1.5 years, but I did it eventually. She helped me get there and never judged that it took so long."
depression,fg276r0,t3_ewdgqq,1580439804.0,"There’s no right or wrong way to feel about it. If you don’t feel proud, that’s ok. If you felt a little uncomfortable, that’s ok. If you left feeling kinda confused, that’s ok too. Therapy is a process, and a weird process at that. It’s a relationship unlike any other type. I can’t think of any typical friendship or family relationship that would be similar. It takes time to feel out what the therapist-client relationship will look like for you and your therapist. I’d give it at least three sessions before you make any decisions about if it’s a good match (unless something inappropriate, unprofessional, unsettling, or unkind happens).  

It’s fine to feel however you feel. Talk about it next week. That might help your therapist learn more about you and how to make you feel comfortable.

(Edit to add: as for their recommendations, don’t worry if you can’t do all of them before your next session. Your therapist won’t kick you out the door. If those things are too much for one week, that’ll be good info for your therapist to know)"

Idk if you’ve done/are doing therapy, but I found a lot of help in trauma-centered therapy (EMDR in my case). Helped with my PTSD, more than my regular therapy did (even though that was also helpful)."

I started **The Fellowship of the Rings** today. Somehow in my 27 years I’ve never read any of the LOTR books? Going to read the series this year. 

Anyone have recommendations for shorter books- less than 10 hours or so audio or less than ~250 pages? Either fiction or nonfiction. I’ve got about 25 books on my reading list, but they’re all on the long-side. Trying to balance out some of that so I keep making progress and stay motivated."
