SuicideWatch,fpmahrd,t1_fpm9a0a,1588728903.0,"Exactly. Making money probably takes up 60+ percent of our lifetime focus and aim. Look at it like this... first of all, the only reason why we go to school is for money. We go to school at least 7 to eight hours a day for probably 23 years. Then as soon as we‚Äôre out we have to make money for about thirty to forty straight years or we can‚Äôt live comfortable lives. After retirement is the only real time we have to fully focus on doing whatever we really want to do with our lives(with the exception of those who are able to make money off what they consider their life‚Äôs purpose). 

I know what I‚Äôm saying could be inaccurate but I just think it‚Äôs unfair that we give more than half our lives to the sole aim of making money instead of just living like animals(not literally) and being able to do whatever the fxck we want to do with our lives."
