Paedophilia OCD is not the same as sexual attraction to minors and, thus, does not mean that person is at risk of causing harm to children. Think of some of the most common manifestations of intrusive thoughts: harm, incest, paedophilia. OCD can tend to fixate on taboo or fearful topics. The content of someone's intrusive thoughts does not mean anything about the individual and it's really harmful to think otherwise as the fear it does is something a lot of people with OCD struggle with. You know what else can increase with isolation and stress? The symptoms of OCD.

BPD,fhy131y,t3_f57dst,1581966338.0,"My partner and I have really struggled with this and after three and a half years, we've managed to implement a number of things that have helped it become much less of an issue, such as:

* When you raise an issue, wording is very important. If your partner is on his phone and you feel ignored and that he doesn't love you, *do not* raise the issue as, ""You keep going on your phone and ignoring me. You're falling out of love with me, I knew it."" When you state it as fact, it comes across as an accusation and if this wasn't your partner's intention, your partner's bound to become defensive because they're being accused of something they didn't do. Instead, tell them what you *perceived* to have happened. Recognise your partner's side of the story.

>When you were on your phone, I perceived it as you ignoring me and it's made me feel like you're falling out of love with me. I recognise things may have been completely different from your perspective, so I wanted to know how things were from your end.

* Don't bring up every little thing you become insecure about. In my case, if I did that, my partner and I wouldn't have a life outside of it. Insecurity will bring anxiety, but the level of anxiety it brings will vary depending on what prompted it. If it's a bearable level of anxiety, wait a while. Sometimes, something else will happen that will reassure you. Sometimes, the anxiety will dissipate on its own as your mind becomes occupied with something else.
* Conversely, recognise that sometimes, there are valid reasons to bring something up. Having BPD in a relationship can be difficult because you can never be sure of what's a valid complaint and what's not because *everything* feels like a valid complaint. It can lead to a situation where you feel you can't say anything ever and even when you do, if your partner puts up resistance, you'll assume it's BPD even when it's something that's normal to have an issue with. It can lead to a lot of frustration because it can feel like you always have to be agreeable, as you described, which will raises tensions in itself and mean when arguments do happen, they can become worse than they would have otherwise. Obviously, recognising what is and isn't a valid concern is tricky, but I find tracking your triggers to be an effective method. If something is a reoccurring theme, it's possible there's a reason for that and it might need discussing. Also, asking others if it would be an issue for them, although make sure this doesn't turn into just seeking reassurance.
* *Recognise your partner has feelings, too.* I think sometimes, we can become so wrapped up in spiralling we forget that our partner's going through this, too. If my partner is getting overwhelmed or he's not in the head space to handle something being brought up in that moment, he says that and I have to stop. Yes, it's ridiculously anxiety-inducing and I may spend all night thinking he hates me and he's going to leave me, but my feelings matter no more than his. If it's something that I feel needs to be addressed, we'll agree to discuss it another time when he's feeling up to it so I can be reassured it won't remain unaddressed. He's also always willing to reassure me in other forms, such as messaging me on his break at work the next day.

It's really hard work and it's something I'm definitely better at some days than others, but it really has made a massive improvement in our relationship. Hope this helps. :)"

To use one of the examples he gave, after a dream of killing their family, someone might be unsettled and have the passing thought that they might be sociopath and it stops there. In the case of someone with OCD, it may not stop there. They become obsessive about it. They examine every single aspect of their life and personality for signs they're a sociopath and examine every aspect of their everyday behaviour. They'll form a growing list of reasons why the thought is correct, much like the one he listed to you.

They may seek reassurance in their fears, such as, in your boyfriend's case, comparing themselves to a serial killer to see whether you agree or not. In OCD, you can logically recognise the thought may be irrational (in your boyfriend's case, recognising he feels remorse and such), but that knowledge doesn't stop the obsession and the anxiety surrounding the thought."

It's not so much about a Mancunian accent as having an accent that people across the UK will associate with being the average, working person. In a sea of politicians that don't sound like that, I'm of the opinion that a leader that does would catch attention.

The appeal of someone who has a working class background is it's something Boris can't compete with.

Someone with a working class background could and the Tories can do a lot, but they can't change the fact Boris has a background majority of the country can't relate to.

As a working class Northerner, I completely agree the idea of ""Throw someone who sounds working class up there"" is missing the point, but it holds merit somewhat. People are likely to feel someone with a Mancunian accent represents them more than someone who sounds like Corbyn and Boris, regardless of their backgrounds. Yes, Boris wasn't a Northerner, but neither was Corbyn.

Most of all, though, we need someone who grew up working class. Boris doesn't understand the struggle of the working class and, as much as Corbyn cared about the working class, neither does he. RLB does seem to have that appeal. Someone who went to Man Met as opposed to Oxford and worked in jobs a lot of the public are is going to feel a lot more relatable to the working person."

Some people have drug and alcohol problems, some don't. Some just genuinely don't have the spare money. The drugs and alcohol argument is overused, insufficient as it doesn't apply to all and contributes to the stigma against people in poverty.

In the community I grew up in, parents starve themselves because it's either they don't eat or their children don't. The only positive thing that's said about my area is we have some of the best run food banks in the country because they're so needed. People can barely sleep during winter because they can't afford heating and even with five layers on and three blankets, it's still so freezing you're shivering violently in bed. Girls don't go to school during their period because their parents can't afford sanitary products.

Some people do not have the money. If you're going to continue to claim otherwise, then no, I don't think we're talking about the same level of poverty here.

Some are in cultures where there's stigma against mental health problems, some are scared of having a BPD diagnosis on their record, some can't afford it, some can't get an appointment even in places with universal healthcare. It's sometimes not as simple as ""Seek professional help.""

There can be an attitude in the mental health communities of people with a diagnosis feeling their struggles are more valid than those without one. If you're one of those people, you're not better than those who are undiagnosed, you've just had the privilege of being able to be diagnosed. The response to posts like these should be to say only a professional can diagnose and that would be the ideal, but if that's not possible, use communities like this for support regardless because it's the symptoms that make our lives hell, not the diagnosis itself."

People who are poorer, thus more likely to vote to the left. When you're in a low income household, you're less likely to be able to afford international holidays, a car or driving lessons and when you're struggling to get food on the table, passports and driver's licenses for the sake of ID come very low on the list of priorities. 

Most people where I'm from don't have any form of ID all across the age spectrum, it's also an extremely safe Labour seat. ID being required to vote would create a massive barrier for the poor and both sides are very aware of it."

Most universities don't request you to have done biology at A Level, so they don't assume you have that level of knowledge. I didn't do biology at A Level, just an A at GCSE and I've been fine. I have to spend more time on biological psychology than other areas, but I've always been like that with science and it's natural to have areas you struggle with more.

It's also worth noting it's very rare someone likes every aspect of their degree. I absolutely despise statistics, for example, but I love majority of my course, so I consider it a fair pay-off. Also, biological psychology will probably be a lot more interesting to you than straight biology, if you're interested in psychology -- it allows you an insight into so many things when it comes to the brain.

In short, if you want to do psychology, go for it. Don't let the biology aspect scare you off."

It's completely understandable that you feel anxiety around leaving her alone. I think most people would in your position, including me. You have a lot of elements now that weren't present before, though -- you've been taught the warning signs to look out for, you know the extent to which she's struggling now, you said she's much more open with you now. That said, you might want to consider whether therapy might be of benefit to you, too. What you experienced was incredibly traumatic, it'd be understandable that you might have to seek the help of a professional to work through it.

Even things I used to love, I'll do and I'll get absolutely nothing from it. It's like someone's turned off the enjoyment switch in my brain. I get as much enjoyment from watching a TV show as the non-depressed person gets from looking at a blank screen. I just feel nothing.

So, I lie in bed and I stare at my wall because when you don't find enjoyment in anything, staring at your wall is no more boring than anything else. All I'm left with are my thoughts: self-hatred, hopelessness, anxiety, traumatic memories, paranoia, torments of what could have been, wondering if this is just how life will be from now on. I spend my days waiting for sleep because it's the only escapism I have.

Have you sought help? If not, I'd really recommend doing so.

Your therapist was way out of line and ridiculously irresponsible and unprofessional. You're well within your right to not want to see her ever again and I don't think you should. In fact, I don't think she should be working with anyone vulnerable if this is something she thinks is okay to say to someone with psychosis. I'm assuming you're in the UK and, therefore, seeing her under the NHS — only if you're comfortable doing so obviously, but I think it would be a really good idea to report this to the mental health services you're under. You and others deserve a better standard of care than this.

AskReddit,f7brwkr,t1_f7bg7ur,1573576214.0,"I know of ARFID and it definitely needs to be talked about more in the eating disorder community, especially as it can have health consequences just as the other eating disorders can. When I've read and watched testimonies of parents of children with ARFID, a lot of them say because society teaches us children will be picky eaters and we need to break them out of that, when their child showed symptoms of ARFID, their reaction was to do anything they could to break it. One of the main reasons ARFID needs to be talked a lot more is so parents can realise that while children can definitely be picky, sometimes, it's a sign of a much bigger problem.

Your post is related, showing the diversity of how this can feature into a person's life and how it can affect them, but even if it wasn't, if talking about this helps, then talk away. What you've been through is awful, do whatever you need to do to try and work through this. I'm listening.

My dad had severe OCD (of course, this doesn't mean everyone with OCD will act this way) and did quite a few things that were similar to your mum, although he was never as extreme and I'm so sorry you had to go through that. When I was at his, I ate an extremely restricted diet because I was only allowed to eat a very small number of foods and he had very bizarre rules surrounding even them (eg. I was allowed noodles, but I couldn't add flavouring; I was allowed toast, but I couldn't have butter on it). Even when I followed those rules, he still shamed me in terms of my eating and weight. What helped me work through this later on is realising that those things were a reflection of him and the things he had going on in his head, not me. It's the same with your mum; those things were about her, not you, you just unfortunately got stuck in the firing line.

I stopped seeing my dad when I was thirteen and only saw him on weekends before that, so I can't even imagine how hard it would have been for this to have been your entire environment growing up and the effect this must have on you now, especially while still trying to maintain a relationship with her. While nice, financial support doesn't negate everything you've been through and it's only one type of support, arguably one of the lower effort ones. I'm so sorry this has robbed you at the chance of having that friend-like mother-child relationship as you grow older. I think it's perfectly normal to grieve the loss of ever having that, I definitely struggle with that a lot. I'm not sure about your view on having children, but what helps me is promising myself that I'll be the kind of mother that will mean my child can have that kind of relationship with me in the future, if that's what they want.

I can completely understand how it could result in restriction, as well. For me, overeating became a problem and, feeling out of control with that, I turned to restriction and purging. Encouraging any sort of problematic thought patterns regarding food isn't good for your child. You're completely right, we need to put much more of a focus on establishing healthy eating patterns in children because the problem is once those problematic food behaviours have been established, they're really hard to break out of (although not impossible and recovery is always possible!)."
