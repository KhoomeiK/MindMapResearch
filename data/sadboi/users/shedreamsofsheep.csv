TwoXChromosomes,fqwrlmf,t1_fqwp0nd,1589715275.0,"What? 

You completely missed my point and then felt butt-hurt because I didn’t validate your suffering as a man and decided to go on a really long rant. 

What I say still stands.  Men don’t see the inequalities that women experience because they don’t deal with them day in and day out. 

The topic wasn’t about the suffering of men, but none the less you had to make it about men. 

This actually proves my point. Women deal with distinct issues, and being drowned out by the wants of men is one of them. 

Again, this woman posted about the struggles of women. There’s no need to make it about the struggles of anyone else, because it just ignores the topic at hand. 

Women are free to talk about women without being told things like “what about sea turtles? They suffer too!” Well really, the sea turtles can suffer, too, but that’s not really the topic at hand."
