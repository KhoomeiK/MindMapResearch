EatingDisorders,fkwinz1,t3_fl3we2,1584593655.0,"I’m having a really hard time. Seeing the empty grocery store shelves really got to me. I have plenty, but I’m scared, so instead of eating what I have, I don’t. 

I’ve been in pretty close contact with my op treatment team this week, which helps. 

Do you have people you can check in with?"
AmItheAsshole,fgy83v4,t3_f0tk3v,1581180484.0,"ESH. She shouldn’t have invited him to go with you, and you should act like a grown up instead of this faking missed calls to give yourself an out."
AmItheAsshole,fgy77xz,t3_f0tmsp,1581180205.0,YTA. She told you your behavior is making her uncomfortable. Respect that.

I’m glad you’ve discovered foods you like!"
AmItheAsshole,fge1nww,t3_exy0p8,1580689501.0,"YTA. Your mom getting a job is not what’s causing the problem here. You acting entitled to your mom’s car and belittling her efforts to get out of the house are. 

She has been sharing her car with you, and you’ve gotten used to that. It’s understandable that dealing with the change of finding your own transportation is frustrating, but you’re lucky you still get to use the car at all. Your parents have every right to take away your access entirely. 

You have a right to be upset, but your mom also has a right to use HER car when and for what she pleases."
AmItheAsshole,fg7zehc,t1_fg7wo1n,1580605433.0,"For me, it isn’t so much actual annoyance as anxiety that manifests as annoyance. And probably a little jealousy. How come this person can eat a sandwich without panicking? 

It’s constant noise in my head, and constant thoughts about food. I try to keep it in my head, but when it gets too overwhelming, sometimes it comes out by nitpicking other’s food choices/habits. 

Eating disorders are hell."
