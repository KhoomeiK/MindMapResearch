depression,eqs870k,t3_bzc9jt,1560278927.0,Somewhere in your mind you know life is still worth living. Hold on to that. Go easy on yourself. Pick three things to get done a day. Even if they are small and simple like  eating a nourishing meal or going for a walk. Don‚Äôt push yourself with long to-do lists. You‚Äôll get there eventually.
depression,eqkfm97,t1_eqkc70j,1560122195.0,"Killing yourself would be much much harder on your family. I didn‚Äôt know how to tell my family since they don‚Äôt really believe in mental illness. But trying to handle it on my own made me even worse, which caused even more stress on my family. If you want to please your family, try to get better. There are days that I can‚Äôt do it for myself so I do it for them."
depression,eoqvd7o,t1_eopz8ee,1558797334.0,Not caring about what people think.
depression,eopsipt,t3_bsrlk8,1558774362.0,"I used to feel like this. Now I‚Äôd be surprised if anyone noticed, much less cared. I‚Äôm always surprised at how quick people are to say there will always be someone there for you. I‚Äôve had multiple people tell me to my face they don‚Äôt know what to do for me when it comes to my depression. Honestly, forgetting other people is the only way to start recovering from depression."
