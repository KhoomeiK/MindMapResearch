LifeAdvice,fr2tn7i,t3_gmc2ya,1589843667.0,"My opinion is there should be no kind of ""hiding"" your relationship. Even if invalidation of your relationship from others is what she's scared of, it's wrong of her to hide things. She needs to be able to handle negative pressure from those around her if she truly cares for you. The world isn't all sunshine and rainbows. Keeping  it non-exclusive boils down to a big ol' fat secret. That just doesn't work well any way you view it and quite frankly, sucks for you."
mentalillness,fpqouqe,t3_geps22,1588828065.0, This is honestly amazing. I had to stop and take it in. I'm a sucker for twisted art and you created something awesome
latebloomerlesbians,fpiagei,t3_gdh2xm,1588636906.0,This made me feel a lot of things. I loved it.
LifeAdvice,fphv7ye,t3_gdgodb,1588628420.0,"My advice is to fill out applications for lots of jobs, even things you're not very excited to do. If you stay limited on what you're looking for, it'll be harder to find something and you will most likely get discouraged in your search for the perfect first job. I'm an over thinker and I over-thought my first job too. Just put out applications, call the managers within a week letting them know you filled out the app. It's likely they'll pull your name and set up an interview. With life and learning new things come new experiences. Don't miss out for fear of not liking the job or not doing well in that line of work. I did not end up where I thought I would with my first job and I ended up learning a ton of workplace skills and also life skills as well. You're young so you have plenty of time to try different things. Good luck!"
LetsChat,fpdudun,t3_gcoto6,1588534426.0,Do you play WoW? I just started playing recently and I've been looking for gaming buddies too. I'm already tired of the trolls... just want people to connect with. 27F. Life has kicked my ass too. Welcome to the club. Message me anytime.
mentalillness,fp5e326,t1_fp4f1eg,1588325926.0,My marriage definitely suffers as well. It takes a toll. Feel free to message me anytime if you'd like to talk
mentalillness,fp47iow,t3_gb44nr,1588293246.0,I'm truly sorry your life is like this. I've been living my life this way for years. It's just too much and it's uncomfortable having to hide how you really feel most of the time for everyone else's sake. I so get this.
AmItheAsshole,foff84b,t1_fofe66z,1587734553.0,"Thank you. I appreciate everyones honesty. I truly needed an outside opinion. We've all been very stressed and its apparent I need to find a way to better cope with it, myself. And I also owe my husband an apology."
AskWomen,fobyfum,t3_g6hkcx,1587665081.0,"That no one really prepared me for adulthood. Because no one can really prepare anyone. You have to figure things out as life goes on. At 13, I thought anyone 21+ had their shit figured out."

depression,fl7vhse,t3_fn1vc8,1584910264.0,"I feel for you. I just found out yesterday that I'll have a loss of income for Idk how long during this whole mess. It really hit me, physically. I was sick all day, couldn't eat, just wanted to sleep. Today, I had a breakdown from past trauma while cooking eggs... eggs. But I'm trying to keep my head up. Singing makes me feel better whether I'm any good at it or not, so today I'm plugging in my mic and singing my heart out to my favorite songs. Just for today. Tomorrow will come later."

LifeAdvice,fi5c7uy,t3_f6j97h,1582159782.0,"You should absolutely try again. It's hard to find people to connect with on such a personal level and it's totally normal to try out different therapists to see who you best connect with. Here's a link to NAMI's website on things you can do to help find the right person for you. Hope this helps!

secret,fhvsp4t,t3_f4mkzn,1581900861.0,"Best advice I can give as someone who's had similar issues with parents, I can tell you that you should lose focus on what they're doing and focus all of that energy on your own life. If you are this invested now, in the long run it's going to fuck with your life so hard. Getting involved in any way is only going to make things worse. They can ruin things for themselves over and over again, don't let them ruin *you.* Try and focus on literally anything else that you know makes you feel happy."
