And this is not to make you question your faith or make you turn a certain way, it's just how I view it from my own experience... If a god or religion is going to make you feel like shit for just being you, doing something that hurts absolutely nobody and is frankly nobody elses' fucking buisness... Fuck them. I'm not saying to leave or anything, but just do you and don't worry about what they think. And if they think it's wrong... Well, that's on them. It's one thing for a group to have rules on what you should and shouldn't do, but being a certain sexuality is not something you choose to do. And again, it hurts nobody. 

And I understand where you're coming from. I had similar issues when I was a theist, so I feel your pain. I've been there. So trust me when I say, it's not worth it to suppress who you are. To live a lie, to feel like nobody really likes you because they don't know who YOU is. And that's not to say that being gay is ALL you are, but if you have to hide it and pretend it's not there... Then you feel secluded, isolated. And it sucks.  Now, I don't know what religion you are, but whatever it is, I'm sure there are sub-groups of it that have nothing against LGBT. I'd say look into those, find people with similar struggles. Don't try to pretend to be whoever you aren't. It doesn't make anything better, and it just makes you feel even more like shit."

Can't really remember anything before I was 15, and my short term memory is shiiiiit... But my mother ALSO has a bad memory. And yet she can use it to her advantage either way. Me?
