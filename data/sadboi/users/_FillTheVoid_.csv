depression_help,fp1kc3b,t3_ganj9f,1588238469.0,"Depression is not a personality trait ! Of course you gonna notice something different, you're not dying, you're the same person but with a healthy amount of neurorecepteur in your brain ! You're not used to it yet ! Like when you start a new habit :) ! But talking about the sentiment of feeling like a false self is really scary and seems like a really good topic to think about before making a choice. In other words, start them when you're really fully committed to go through it. It hurts, let it hurts and acknowledge it and cry about it !  And then you will be able to make a choice because you're the judge of your life, be kind to yourself !

I wish you well :)"

And you're suffering ? The more you suffer the better is pleasure. Am not gonna lie its extremely hard to not do it sometimes, but hey i still need to figure out if this complete shit world is this worthless.

depression,fce2pnd,t1_fcdwn4n,1577616361.0,"Damn, that's profound, the pain is still there, only it switches places. You made the choice to keep it so it won't hurt nobody else, you're really strong and I just experienced that too ( remembering the loved ones when you choose to die ). Not gonna lie, I want people to understand my pain, maybe that why I want to kill myself, but will I do it ? I think its unfair, that I have access to this knowledge of pain without being able to express it nor pass it through, because of how shitty it is. It's stuck to us because we don't want to be selfish, but don't I have the right to be selfish in a world where self centered people are the ""winner"" ? I don't want to ""win"", I don't really seek that, but everyone is asking why don't I ""win"" ? Today, I made the choice to be selfish, I will kill myself for sure, I will be so selfish and ""winning"" nobody will suffer for my end. The worst in all this shit is that I don't think nobody cares about me and they will only ""care"" if I die! I was like that myself. How someone can be so stupid to take his own life ?! Yeah, I don't expect people to understand anymore, I hate this feeling of uncontrollable life, thoughts and pain. I don't know if there is much to life, it doesn't matter because I don't like it ! I think we mourn our deads because of the loneliness they leave us in, there is no ""love"", but everybody fear to not exist and if no one remember us that we exist then we feel like shit. It's not death that we're afraid of but to stop existing. Some will says that's why religions exist and maybe they are right maybe not, we just don't know a single fucking thing, but we pretend to. I hate this, it suck, why am I even writing this rn, yeah guess it to exist."
