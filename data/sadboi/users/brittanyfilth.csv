I don't wanna alarm you but facing it will be hard if it's worse when sober. But like others said, once you're stable and in routine and clear headed, handling anxiety while sober is much easier as long as your open to looking for healthy tools to deal with your feelings in a constructive way. My partner wasn't the reason I decided to quit, I was the reason I quit, but he was definitely an influence and something that helped my motivation. I wanted to be sober, happy, stable, and find my true self so I could be strong. So I could be strong and be there for him unconditionally as much as he was for me when I needed it. Not just for him, but for my whole support system. I wanted to be able to give them all back what they had given me. So I could look at myself everyday and say with confidence ""This is who I am, and this is who I want to be."" I got there.

November 2019 went for perio cleaning. Told hygienist about sensitivity. She took these xrays and told me I might need two root canals on that spot. Periodontist was busy in surgery. I have appointments with my dentist and perio both in the same week soon. I don't distrust them obviously, I just want more insight on what's happening in that area?
