ABA,feglxk4,t3_e57eqp,1579096799.0,"A little update (sorry for the unanswered questions and thank you for your responses!)

I got hired on as an intern with a company that is putting me on the track and supporting me through each step. I have my competency assessment soon and will get the RBT certification in a matter of days hopefully, and then (according to them) I will be offered a paid position with this company. I think this will be a better route than trying to go about it without the help of a company and just working under one BCBA. This will give me several supervisors and the opportunity to take on more cases."
ABA,f9iagml,t3_e57eqp,1575332232.0,Thank you!
bcba,f9ia1wn,t3_e56sz3,1575331938.0,I was already working on my RBT before I started this job. I’m really confused... was I not supposed to take the RBT course without already working for a company who hires RBTs? I thought I could work cases with a BCBA in various settings.
bcba,f9i9ov3,t3_e56sz3,1575331680.0,I’m not working on any cases yet. I work in the field but only as a support professional.
BehaviorAnalysis,f9i496a,t1_f9i3us2,1575327893.0,"Thank you for your response. I don’t believe our staff are RBTs- the BCBAs and RBTs come work with a specific few clients. We are a day program for mentally disabled adults. I was hoping to work on cases elsewhere with a BCBA, preferably working with kids."
askaguy,f5o6dnn,t3_doij2n,1572310978.0,"The man I’m currently seeing wants every benefit of a committed relationship without any sacrifice. It’s pretty arrogant. When I set a boundary, he becomes more persistent like he doesn’t want to lose the relationship, and that is confusing since he said he doesn’t want a girlfriend right now. Isn’t that selfish and arrogant? Correct me if I’m wrong."
BPD,ewgcphh,t3_co2vhx,1565378923.0,The only thing that has helped me in my interpersonal relationships is learning DBT skills. My <3 goes out to you. I hope you find someone who will see all of you and love all of you.

BPD,ew68h8p,t3_cml7m2,1565157902.0,You are definitely not alone in these feelings as you can see! I like to think that we are more made of love and in tune with our souls. The rage is at the world and all of its injustice.

CPTSD,evdmys3,t3_cjcuc8,1564442229.0,"LOL I just had a DBT session where I was complimented on distress tolerance skills as well only the conversation in my head hadn't been so encouraging. :)  I try not to rehearse conversations in my head because it comes out more genuinely to just go with the flow. It also causes me unneeded anxiety to think or worry about the future convos and interactions I might have, and it sometimes makes me avoid the conversation or person altogether.

BPD,evad37s,t1_eva694x,1564344718.0,Love this reply!! We have such good days and bad. My problem is everything seems permanent and nothing actually is and I need to realize that. Especially during a good day I need to realize it too will pass just like the bad ones. Then I wouldn’t be so devastated every time I fall off the pink cloud. I have euphoric days that might be more related to my Bipolar and then when I crash it’s hard and my BPD kicks in with all the negative self talk. Exhausted.
BPD,evacc8f,t1_eva020a,1564344187.0,"Omg! I literally just took a video of a clear blue sky and the huge dark cloud over me.... while in the middle of an event I of course was coming apart over... I happened to look up and was like.. yup.. this is my life. But I quickly had to realize there were OTHER PEOPLE under this cloud too. Im not the center of the universe and not experiencing any more or less life circumstance than other people. Everyone has problems, I just can’t handle them as well... Or at all sometimes!! I’m practicing DBT skills, and on a slight positive note they ARE helping! I’m sharing my experience in DBT on a blog.. I just started the therapy. You are welcome to follow me along as I go. :)

bipolar,eva7foe,t1_ev9bm8a,1564340722.0,That’s so good to hear that it’s not just a honeymoon phase or something lol because I really have never been able to regulate especially a panic attack EVER until these skills.
BPD,ev96qee,t1_ev79j2j,1564309125.0,"Yes! That was a selling point for my family and I for sure. Great point. DBT continues until you're better, or quit going. I'm going to keep going, because my life depends on it!"
BPD,ev4xsj7,t3_chpjpf,1564223639.0,"Wow, this sounds so much like myself! I have been ""self-harming"" in subtle ways since the age of 13. I have subconsciously sabotaged any good thing that has come my way. I have left relationships and quit jobs out of delusional fear of abandonment. I have gone weeks without eating and deprive myself of sleep. I got to a serious point where I had totally given up on trying at life at all. I lost 30 pounds in a month and had not much will to live. I have just stated DBT therapy. It is completely unaffordable for most people, and I am very grateful to have this opportunity (with help from my family). It is also not offered in a lot of smaller cities and rural areas. I had to move 6 hours to get the treatment. In order to help others who cannot get treatment, I have decided to blog my entire experience in DBT therapy. I started only a month and a half ago. My first post just describes the last episode that led me to one of my darkest points. I will be following up in the next day or so with the skills I have learned this far and an update on how it has changed my thought patterns and behavior so far. I am already emerging from this last episode with hope for the future that I haven’t had in a very long time! You can follow my blog here, and I hope it helps you or your friends in the depths!!

BPD,ev4wejb,t3_chp2yw,1564222832.0,"I totally agree!!! I’m 32 years old and been suffering all my life with this disorder. Finally, on the verge of suicide, my parents decided to foot the bills for my DBT therapy. On a positive note, the skills that I am learning thus far have been highly effective, and I will be sharing my experience and everything I’m learning on a blog for those that can not afford therapy or who live in an area that doesn’t offer it. I personally had to move 6 hours from home to get this treatment. Follow my blog and stay tuned for weekly updates after each session! I hope to be able to help anyone I can. It’s ridiculous that this therapy isn’t more available to people who’s LIVES depend on it!! I wish you the best in your journey and am here for a support connection if you would like to have that.

I’ve just started the therapy a month and a half ago so the first post is just explaining the last severe episode that brought me to this point and a little hope for what is to come after already having some success from the treatment.

I have just started DBT and will be blogging week by week throughout my treatment so that maybe I can help others who are not able to get the treatment. You are welcome to follow my blog. I’ve just started treatment, so my first post is really just explaining the last episode that led me to finally get treatment. I will be posting another soon with some details on the skills I’ve learned so far. They are proving to be very beneficial. I hope it lasts!

BPD,ev4mij6,t3_ciacgi,1564216923.0,"I too oscillate between being highly patient and engaging with just about anyone,and then being the exact opposite. It is usually in response to paranoia. I’m either afraid of them in some way, especially at AA meetings in the city I live in because we have a lot of scary people that come and go, or it’s because I am having disproportionate anger and unfortunately sometimes other people become the reason for my anger. Anger is a very uncomfortable emotion for me, so I tend to subconsciously inflict it on other people so as not to keep the emotion inside me. Most of the time, I let it out while I'm alone. 

I am going through DBT right now and we have TIPP skills that are helping me with anger as well as panic and depression. One of the skills especially for anger is intense exercise even if just a short sprint down the street and back. Another option is to dip my face in a bowl of cold water. It lowers the heart rate.. this one is good for anxiety. 

This is not one of the TIPP skills (more of a mindfulness skill), but during depression, or rather just an extreme bout of sadness, using my senses like smell especially of the outdoors, even dirt, grounds me (no pun intended LOL) and comforts me in a strange way.  

These skills really work!

I have just recently started the DBT and will be sharing my experience on a blog, week by week so that others have a chance to learn some of the skills they teach. It’s given me the most hope I have had at getting better in a long time! You can view my blog here... linked at the end!

BPD,ev4jf1k,t1_ev4gso9,1564215073.0,"Yes! I have definitely gotten a lot out of working the AA program. Unfortunately, probably because of my lack of will to live, when I did drink I ended up in the hospital almost every time. That’s not to say alcoholism is secondary to my BPD though I definitely know for sure I have primary alcoholism (not just an underlying symptom of another disorder). My psychiatrist diagnosed me with BPD, PTSD, and Bipolar. So I am an extreme work in progress. I do feel a little manic right now, with the excitement of this new found hope. I’m just using it as fuel to reach out to others who I can help and try to remember it’s not all about me. 

But yes the structure of AA is Very similar. One on ones with sponsor and group therapy. DBT actually brings in things like mindfulness and spirituality, so they go hand in hand. I wish my last sponsor could have been more open minded about it. She suggested I put therapy on hold while I work the steps. Been there done that. Not doing that again. I’ve realized, and it says this In the reading on how it works which is read at the beginning of each meeting, that some of us have grave mental and emotional disorders but do have the capacity to get better as long as they are honest with themselves. Being honest with myself has meant NOT following every suggestion they give me like its Gold. And being honest with myself when a sponsor might not be the best fit and to politely (this part is hard for me) let them know it’s not going to work.  

Sorry for the rant! 😅"
BPD,ev4e7un,t3_ciecw9,1564212371.0,Wow! I laughed out loud! You nailed it with already having second thoughts about the therapist. Sometimes she seems dry and I have to remember she’s not my friend and I just need to learn these skills she’s highly trained in. 🤣🙄🤗😅

I feel like when I am in those moods I am highly paranoid, but also can't help but acknowledge the fact that I'm being ignored... so I try not to text to make sure I am not overbearing. Sometimes the person will eventually ask why I am ghosting THEM. It makes me so miserable to the point I cannot have a healthy relationship... constantly wondering if the other person is sincere, even though all of their words and actions seem to be. My idea of being ignored or my perception of being ignored is usually way off point. But at the time it seems so valid.
