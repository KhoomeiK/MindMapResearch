BPD,fl1z3sx,t3_flzdl9,1584739350.0,"Regardless of BPD the best thing you can do in this situation is to clearly and professionally ask her to cease the behaviour in writing and then ignore. No matter what is said, ignore. 

Make your accounts private and if that doesn‚Äôt work delete the accounts all together. Your mental health is more important than a social media account."
Reformed,fkvsygf,t1_fkvsd4k,1584576074.0,"It‚Äôs kind of funny because when my dietician explained it to me I was skeptical as well. I think her main point is that if you give a food a label that makes it ‚Äúworse‚Äù than other foods you give that food a certain power which can contribute to craving it more. Allowing yourself to eat all types of foods doesn‚Äôt mean you should rely on eating processed foods or only the type of foods that people classify as ‚Äújunk food‚Äù it is just a strategy the dietician taught me to help curb cravings and treat food more like fuel and take away any moral value society places on certain foods. 

For example, personally, when I stopped treating chocolate like it was this forbidden thing, keeping it in my house even, at first I ate a lot of chocolate. But eventually once I allowed myself to eat it whenever I wanted to it became less special and I actually craved it less, and ate less of it."

Reformed,fkvpdom,t1_fku84l5,1584573940.0,"I think most of this is good advice. However with eating disorders it is very harmful (and counter intuitive) to label certain foods as ‚Äújunk‚Äù, restrict yourself to buying certain types of food and hiding food. Most of the time that type of behaviour just heightens cravings and can lead to binge eating. 

When I was in recovery my dietician had the approach of everything in moderation. Also, she told us that the more types of food you allow yourself to eat, the less power the food has to be tempting or worrisome because eventually it just becomes like any other food. Of course if you have restricted yourself from eating something for a long time and allow yourself to eat it you might eat more of it at first, but the novelty eventually wears off as well as the cravings."
Reformed,fkvod5p,t3_fkhger,1584573338.0,"I suffered from a restrictive eating disorder and then binge eating so I can really relate to your struggle. The key for me to beating the eating disorder was trusting that my body would not betray me and allowing myself to eat, even if I thought it was ‚Äútoo much‚Äù. Eating disorders are really good at tricking people into perceiving the amount they eat incorrectly. After practicing this for a while I was able to trust my body more and I felt much less desperate around food... but this takes time and patience and it is okay to make mistakes in recovery. Three years into recovery I am still working on this. Therapy and working with a dietician helped immensely as well. 

From a Christian perspective, the way I look at it is that when you are engaging in eating disorder behaviour ‚ÄúED thoughts‚Äù are your main focus. Even if you try, when you are so concerned with food and body image it is hard to live a life that God wants you to live and it is hard to serve God when you are so focused on something else. This is not to say that having a mental illness is your fault or that you should just will your way through it. Rather it is said as an encouragement to give recovery all that you‚Äôve got because I promise you when you are recovered your mind is so much more open to positive things, like seeing yourself how God sees you and serving God to the best of your ability."
