OverwatchUniversity,fr20a63,t1_fr0hvg3,1589828960.0,"Ok I watched it from your PoV... Youre definitely not a diamond player. Those GM/T500 players, no offence to them, but they are talking out of their arse because its a load of shit. That's fine though, you already knew that and Im here to help you. Here is a list of the things you need to look at in your gameplay and fix:

- The biggest glaring issue was your cooldown use... You kept spamming sleep off cd it feels and this isnt good at all, you want to save it for situations where you or a teammate needs peel, or to cancel/shut down key ults. Spamming it like you did in this game is a really bad habit to have, but you'll be glad to know its a bad habit  common for your rank. Your nade usage was better... but still really bad, you self nade in some situations where you dont need to. During the second round you asked your lucio for heals in the off fight... this is good, and you need to do this more often. You want to set your nade up for offensive uses as much as possible. The one fight you won on lighthouse was because you hit a fat nade. Try not to just throw it blindly into shields either, if the rein is in the way look for a surface to splash it off of... or go for a flank angle to hit them from behind.

- Another big issue was your positioning... sometimes it looked as if you just didnt know where you should be standing. What you want to do in general is play somewhere such that your team are between you and the enemy... and you have good LoS to heal them. Lighthouse for example... you played in the open in front of point, when you cap the point you want to play in the back on point itself.

- Your ult usage wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. You want to use nano to combo with a dps ult, to facilitate a push on your tank, or to peel and save someone (Usually a tank). But you don't want to use it in a fight you cant win. which you did once or twice.

What I noticed though... you lost round 1 because of your tank picks... Zarya Hog vs Rein Zarya really isn't good since neither Zarya nor Hog are good at taking space, this isn't something you can control though so I wouldn't worry about it... it happens now and again. Round 2 its a bit harder to tell what the main problem was for you guys as a team other than the enemy just playing better. 

This isn't what you should focus on though... the bigger picture isn't something you can control as much as just looking at what you are doing. Improving yourself makes it so you are less likely to be the weak link on your team... which will win you more games.

One more thing... normally Id do a more full timestamped review, but there is a game patch tomorrow and I wouldn't be able to get it done in time for you to watch back yourself with the review so Ive done more of a summary. I hope it helps you out regardless, and I'm sorry about that. I didn't think about the patch tomorrow before agreeing to review this lmao."
Competitiveoverwatch,fr0s35z,t3_glkto0,1589805323.0,"Honestly I think Moira is in a good place as much as people may disagree.

She isnt too hard to kill if youre not a complete potato. 50dps isnt that high, and can already be either mostly or completely negated with a pocket heal.

She has extremely high healing but it is somewhat limited both by range and by being resource based. Thats fair in my opinion.

Her shift is honestly fine as an escape ability because its misuse can be punished.

Her ult is the only thing I would argue is somewhat strong because her high healing lets her have it almost every fight... but you only need to increase the ult cost to sort that out... I think the ult itself is fine.

All in all I think people hate on moira too much... she is low skill high reward yeah... but other healers reward high skill with more value... moira is basically a heal bot hero with no utility, but that doesnt make her bad either. The only thing I find annoying is random skill orbs... but those dont happen often enough for me to consider it a problem with her kit."

It really sucks that these people exist, but one of the things Ive done is just learn to ignore these people because they don't actually mean it. Why should you take to heart what a random stranger on the internet tells you?

I know that's kind of shitty advice ""Oh just ignore them 4head"", but its that or mute them or don't join voice chat. Just know that for every shit person there is that plays this game there is also someone who is genuinely nice and understanding.

If you ever need someone to talk to my dude, hit me up in DMs. I don't mind playing with you in game if you need some positive reinforcement. I know how much depression can ruin you, Ive experienced it first hand."

OverwatchUniversity,fpfynnw,t3_gd7ure,1588588432.0,"If they dont change after you ask there isnt much you can do about that. What you can do is try your best to enable them regardless.

As a support in these situations you want to be a lot more careful with your positioning and make sure you dont wander into LoS of snipers and spam. 

At the same time you want to do your best to keep your tanks alive as long as possible, without a shield you will likely have to babysit them a lot more as they try to push.

Another thing you can do is try to use your kit to make plays and create openings for your team to push. Go for big anti nades as ana or discord focus targets as zen for example.

More than anything though put your own life before anyone elses. You die and everyone else wont be far behind with no heals."

If your PC isnt good enough to record a vod you can always share a replay code too. Thing is without anything to look at there isnt much that we can do other than give general advice."
OverwatchUniversity,fo437jl,t1_fo3ignn,1587497427.0,"Alright, I did as much as a could but I was booted out of the game for a new patch and then I couldnt watch anymore, I got most of it reviewed though for what its worth... although you cant really watch it back yourself anymore. Ill give you a summary of the mistakes I noticed a lot though:

- Your aggression:- You are playing ana a bit too aggressively most of the time, like you are always right in the front which isn't the best position to be in. You want to play more in the back, where you are a lot safer.

- Use of scoped shots:- I dont know why but you rarely ever liked to scope in at all, maybe this is because of the aggression or what. but you need to try and use scoped shots more since they are more accurate and hit scan, so you don't need to wait for the projectile. This also suits playing more in the back since you can just scope to aim and heal better

- Cooldown Usage:- Overall, pretty poor. You tend to use sleep and nade on the first enemy or teammate that needs healing that you see, which isn't good considering how important they are. You want to use your nade to facilitate plays with anti and to save teammates who are literally on the edge of dying since it amps healing for them when you nade them, also if their attacers are close range you anti them too, so its win win. Save your sleeps either for peel or punish. You never want to spam them down main ever. You want to save them to save yourself or a teammate who is about to die, punish enemies out of position, or to shutdown important ults on the enemy team. Also try to call out your sleeps whenever you hit one. Getting help can secure you a kill you wouldn't otherwise have gotten.

I wont lie, a big reason you won this game was luck... your other support and one of your dps were pretty bad, which hilariously saved you the point at one point of your defence... both of them inting at the same time got the bastion 3 kills which saved the point lmao.

These are the biggest things you need to work on though, you are playing Ana more like a tank or dps than a support which isn't good. Fix this, along with your cooldown usage and I think you will see fast improvement."
OverwatchUniversity,fo3hftk,t1_fo3gea5,1587486964.0,"Its ok, I assumed as much watching it through. Ill watch through again now taking notes and then Ill write up a review for you...

pcgaming,fne74ze,t3_g139nu,1586884235.0,"I'm glad I never bought this game. 

I remember being hardcore into battlefield 1 back when that was still the main game and over time things with that just went further and further downhill. The devs had no clue on how to balance and manage their game and the community itself was never open to discussions at all... it was either echo in their echo chamber or be exiled.

Never again. I'm done with battlefield as a franchise, and this basically proves my point as to why. I advise anyone with any sort of sense to do the same."
OverwatchUniversity,fm1x19b,t1_fm1ssr0,1585686545.0,"You cant really grind to improve your awareness... all you can do is play and keep what I said in mind, keep an ear out for enemy footsteps being a key one. Also if someone is actively attacking you or someone you can help don't tunnel vision on something that isn't as important, like when the enemy Genji popped blade on point B of your defence... if you were listening out for footsteps you probably would have heard the enemy soldier flanking. 

Glad I could help though :)"
CivVI,flue64z,t3_fr5mzs,1585500817.0,"Not the most optimal configuration there but still very functional, nice job!

You are supposed to build the aqueducts so that they are each adjacent to two of the industrial zones. So imagine if the three industrial zones make a triangle... put the aqueducts on the edges of it to make a bigger triangle. 

For example in this image where you put Ruhr Valley, the +4 Commercial hub and the Dam in Aachen should have been aqueducts. You still could have built the Ruhr Valley where the Aqueduct in Aachen is"
OverwatchUniversity,fll6rav,t1_fll5zdv,1585254661.0,"(Hit the character limit)

your poor mechanics resulted in more than a few deaths on your team. Try to practice against bots. You need to improve your hip fire accuracy if you want to get good at Ana. as for target priority... healing teammates should ALWAYS come before damaging enemies unless its an enemy who dove you. As for healing priorities... Squishies first then tanks unless your tank is in immediate danger of dying without a pocket.

* **Awareness and tunnel vision** - There were plenty of times in that game where you missed important audio cues which give you really important information. Hearing enemy footsteps behind you lets you know to expect a flank for example. Also you tend to tunnel vision on one thing a bit too much which is a bad habit you need to try to break out of.

* **Sleep Darts** - It appeared as if you tend to impulsively like to use sleep off cooldown... which really isnt a good idea because if you keep spamming it when you dont need to use it you wont have it when you do need it. Sleep should only ever be used for self peel (saving yourself from someone attacking you), teammate peel (saving a teammate who would die if you dont sleep the person attacking them). Ult shutdowns, You should always use your sleep to shut down an enemy ult if you have it off CD, like you tried against the enemy soldier on your defence at the end.

Overall if you work on these things Im confident you can climb out of bronze. If you need any more help or questions feel free to throw me a DM dude, Im happy to help."
OverwatchUniversity,fll5zdv,t1_flkpgyp,1585254251.0,"Ok lol, I just spent the last three hours going through this and taking notes by HAND... Christ I cant feel my fingers right now. Still, Id like to go through the game bit by bit with you.

**- DEFENCE -**

*0:47* :- I really like your initial positioning here, you are playing in the back behind your shield with LOS in the choke and easy cover to run to on the left.

*0:50-1:05* :- You are over hard scoping here... when your teammates are that close you want to hip fire.

*1:05* :- You wasted your sleep here, instead of using it on the enemy frontline you should save it for peel (Saving someone, either your team or yourself) or to punish flankers. Not the front line.

*1:15* - Ok, now you are hip firing but your accuracy is pretty bad so you nade to heal everyone instead, nading to heal isn't bad all the time but you want to try and use your nade more offensively than defensively.

*1:38* :- I like how you instinctively tried to sleep the rein as he charged here but when he charges one of your tanks its better to just throw a nade and save sleep instead. You did nade him but needlessly wasted your sleep.

*1:51* :- this was a good nade to punish the over aggression from the Winston... you wasted your sleep on him again though.

*2:00* :- Good rotation to stick with your team but you just keep going which puts you at unecessary risk because now you are in the open and on your own. Enemy Winston sees this and tried to jump you, luckily he goes in on his own and gets shredded.

*2:15* You keep rotating between left and right as if you dont know where you should be standing, you need to find a spot with good LoS on your team which is also relatively safe. Most of the time this is in the back, in this case it is left side of point.

*2:25* :- There is an enemy tracer top left poking away at your squishies and you aren't there to help them. Your Mei tries to 1v2 the Ana and tracer, gets purpled and dies. That isnt your fault though, its the Mei's.

*2:35* :- Ok this is a crucial error you are about to make. Your Orisa is currently being pressured by the tracer and your mercy is busy killing the enemy Ana and rezzing mei. You needed to stay left side to support her and keep her alive, instead you rotate right and let her die. This eventually results in you losing point A.

*2:45* :- Just to add you nanoed the Mei in a 3v6, you have already lost the fight at this point and ulting there is just a waste. you want to back out and wait for your team before you re-contest.

*3:50* :- You wasted another sleep on the monkey there, nade him yeah... but you want to save your sleeps for when someone is in danger of dying

*4:15* :- Another wasted sleep dart, however your positioning on this point so far is pretty good, well done.

*4:23* :- The enemy Tracer comes back and harasses your backline again but you dont notice because you missed the sound cues. You tunnel too much on main rather than getting the tracer to fuck off by throwing a nade or trying to sleep her. Another wasted sleep and then you keep hard scoping shots you should be hip firing... like I know your hip fire aim sucks but you need to practice if you want to get good at Ana.

*4:38* :- Good nade to punish the Winston.

*4:42* :- Enemy rein pins your Dva and you give her nano. This is actually an Ok Decision to make in that situation because the Dva can burst the rein down and then go after the squishies in main.

*4:50* :- You finally take notice of the Tracer in your backline but only when she starts trying to kill you instead of your teammates, you need to listen to audio cues like footsteps and gunfire a bit more. It will make you a much better player.

*5:00* :- Playing this far back is a little risky given you know there is a Tracer nearby, its giving her a really good chance to pick you off if she wanted to. In that situation I would stick closer to my team for peel.

*5:13* :- the mccree in front of you needed heals but you chose to poke the enemies instead.

*5:25* :- Enemy monkey approaches you from high ground and surprises you, although his footsteps were really audible before he dropped down. Again though... he is on his own and feeds.

*5:35* :- Enemy genji pops blade and you tunnel vision on him too much which lets the soldier flank behind and fuck you up. This soldier goes on to kill 2 more and win them the fight.

*5:57* :- Good on you, you recognised that your team needed to regroup here.

*6:11* :- the enemy has a Pharah now, and whilst its not your job to kill her you can still put a ton of pressure on her because your scoped in aim is hit scan.

*6:34* :- I get you were trying to help the cree here but your safety should always come first before anything else. you should have slept that monkey much sooner than you did eventually.

*6:42* :- Your Dva and Mei are frontlining right now and are slowly getting fucked up by the enemy, you should consider trying to help them after the mccree. The mccree dies which is unlucky but he traded with the pharah at least. Don't beat yourself up about the cree dying, that was just bad mechanics and less poor decision making. Mechanics are something you can always practice.

*6:45* :- Your Dva and Mei are both incredibly lucky to have survived there... and they then go on to carry the team fight. You probably wouldn't have held at B if they died.

*7:10* :- First time Im saying this, but good sleep on the soldier. You missed sure, but situations like this are what you want to save it for. if you keep spamming it down main you probably wont have it when stuff like this happens.

Anyway, Nice hold. Onto the attack round.

**- ATTACK -**

*8:50* :- wtf is their ball doing? like he just hangs there in the choke and slams your team right in front of you... in higher ranks this would be considered throwing lol, he feeds so hard here.

*9:10* :- The enemy soldier has high ground and LoS on you here meaning he can pressure you really easily. He is distracted so you should have used that opportunity to push up with your team because you are being left behind. Instead you try to sleep him basically letting him know where you are.

*9:34* :- You shouldn't be flanking like this as Ana, its a really good way to get yourself killed. Stick with and behind your team.

*9:40* :- Because of that off angle you took before your Dva got de-meched when you were rotating back around. this wouldn't have happened if you positioned correctly.

*9:45* :- You land a sleep on the Torb but instead of running because the rest of your team is dead you stick around and try to kill him. Torb is 250hp and you can't one shot 250hp targets on your own, so either call for help in comms or run away.

*10:00* :- You rotate left to try and help your winston but that means you don't have LoS to help the Mccree or Dva, if you went right with the Mccree and Dva you could have still helped the monkey when you peeked point, and you the Dva and Mccree would be safer because you were together. This is hypothetical though, in reality Torb orgasms all over point and kills like 3 of you. Not much you could have done to stop that, even if you went right you would have died to it too. That was on your Dva to be honest because she can eat Torb's ult as he shoots it.

*10:48-11:18* :- I liked your use of cover here to try and stay alive. Your nano was a part of the win condition and you knew that so you tried to stay safe. good on you.

*11:18* :- You nano the reaper and he pops off, all that is left is cleanup... which you did a lot better than the enemies on their push. Although you put up more of a fight on your defence too to be fair.

*11:55* :- You saw the reaper go right and thought to try and help him, which is ok but you should have bailed and ran back to your team the moment the Torb started attacking you. Instead you take the 1v1 and lose leaving your team to 5v6.

*12:30* :- You push way too far forward here, you shouldnt be front lining as ana. This ends up in you burning both of your cds on the torb and your widow dies because you weren't there to heal her.

*12:44* :- You should have slept the rein as he charged there. You tunnel visioned a bit too much on helping your reaper and monkey way in the front.

*13:05* :- The team fight is over now, hiding like this is staggering yourself.

*13:20* :- You manage to get back to your team anyway and even save the widow to boot, good job... but you wont get away with this in higher elos. You and the widow would have died there if it was a higher elo.

*13:30* :- You are playing too far forward here. Id be playing in the back near the arch the payload goes through. That poor positioning lets the Dva kill you and then snowballs into another fight loss.

*14:05* :- good to see you try to regroup again :)

*14:29* :- nice rotation from your whole team to fuck the soldier... you waste your sleep again just after.

*14:42* :- I would be scoping in here to make sure my shots are actually healing the Dva and not hitting enemies like they were here. When the Dva gets de-meched you waste your sleep again.

*14:55* :- This fight is lost. There are 16 seconds left so you should be trying to regroup for one final push.

*15:03* :- I think you kind of just gave up there... you swap to Lucio to try and get back to point but it didnt matter int he end.

**- SUMMARY -**

I was actually surprised by this vod at how competent bronze players can actually be sometimes... like its a mess sure but you do some things right. As for you, you have a lot of problems with your play... but the good news is there is a lot you can choose to improve on. Here is my list of things for you to focus on:

* **Positioning** - Your positioning is really poor a lot of the time in that game which results in a few fight losses, watch some youtube videos and tutorials about proper Ana positioning.

* **Mechanics and Target Priority** - Your mechanics are really poor, which is to be expected for a bronze player. And your target priority needs work"

Some of the things you saw I feel could be explained better with some context as to what I was thinking at the time. But I wont bore you with that

All in all what you gave was good advice. I usually try to ult track but sometimes I can be a bit absent minded and forget. Some fights that game I didnt really know what to expect in advance.

A couple of things I learned though... I need to learn to use my personal for engagements rather than for soaking up spam when Im already high charge. I also need to learn to change how I play when I know I dont have my CDs.

I already knew my over aggression was an issue... but this makes it clear that its still an issue I need to resolve. I straight up fed a couple of times that game.

As for comms I wasnt in vc this game because I have some mental issues when it comes to dealing with social settings and my head just wasnt in the right place to deal with it that day. There were definitely some situations where this hurt us though.

Your advice will definitely help me moving forward though for sure. You ever considered going into coaching? You dont need to be a high rank to have a good understanding of the game which you certainly seem to from this review.

Thanks again :)"

OverwatchUniversity,fk1so62,t1_fk1oedb,1583786074.0,"I play Zarya most of the time when I tank on ladder and I both agree and disagree with you... Zarya and ball can work as long as the ball is drawing enough aggro away from your front line, your ball needs to play as a disrupter.

If the enemy doesn't pay much attention to your ball then you are forced to front line which you cant really do on your own so you get walked over if the enemy team just runs at you.

A Rein isn't necessary no, but I do prefer it when I have a shield to back up behind when I'm done dealing damage or building charge with my self bubble. It also ensures I don't have to solo front-line and get melted when the enemy comes at us."
Competitiveoverwatch,fiu7ivc,t1_fiu77tg,1582736470.0,Well a tracer is different. Its a lot easier to one shot her lol. Even if you mess it up you force her recall and make her back off. Still I only do it myself if I have to.

CivVI,fhcbcwd,t1_fhc3etv,1581459991.0,"Desert + Tundra = restart due to poor yield potential (Usually) and dead tiles.

Yes you can build districts on the desert tiles but the desert tiles usually aren't in a good place to give you high adjacency on your districts (Which is true in this case).

In time yes, you could probably make this a really strong city but as a first city its not really that good at all since it will slow you down early on. And the early game is always the most important since it sets you up for later on.

This is coming from an advanced player who usually plays on Deity."
CivVI,fgzsw4c,t3_f0qdmm,1581197282.0,"Personally, I would re-roll this because its a pretty bad start, even with the natural wonder.

Since you are new though I wouldn't worry too much about where you place your city, just settle in place. In place is probably the best spot you can settle here thinking about it though, that or one tile north on the incense."
civ,fgp4ocu,t3_ezp95w,1580996754.0,"There isn't really any set number of things to look for, but you want to make sure that your city has three things in the first two hexes of where you settle:

1. **Good place for food**: i.e. nice flatland where you can put farm triangles (Grassland is better for this, but plains is also decent) You can also look for things like marsh early on which has good food yield as a base without needing farms.

2. **Good place for production through raw yield**: i.e. Plenty of hills or forest for mines/lumber mills. If you have forest on hills then you can chop to rush stuff then put mines on the hills so wooded hills aren't useless.

3. **Good place for district adjacency**: You want to make sure that there is a good placement area for 2-3 different districts in a city you are about to place.

Some other important rules to consider:

1. When you settle a city the city centre tile yield always conforms to 2 food 1 production whilst keeping any extra yields (which is why plains hills give you a 2-2 tile to start with) as well as any extra yields from resources. (which is why plains hill with a luxury is S tier for actual tiles to settle on, provided its on fresh water) this however does *NOT* include extra yields from features like forest or marsh since they get destroyed when you settle the city.

2. Fresh water is really important because without it your initial growth will be painfully slow due to limited housing. Without fresh water coastal is next best since it still gives a bonus to initial housing, just not as much as fresh water.

3. To add on to the point about city centre yield... settling on a resource gives you access to that resource instantly! Even without the normal required tech, this is especially useful with plantation luxuries earlier on since it lets you delay irrigation to get more important techs."

I just felt as though you assessed some of them a bit unfairly. Having read your edit though I see where you are coming from.

When it comes to the acropolis I want to add the fact that wonders are a lot harder to build on higher difficulties, especially early game ones which you have to proper hard rush and still might not get. What the acropolis actually does is let you set up a cultural powerhouse with clustered districts to get your culture gen going a lot faster.

Also the unique district discount doesnt really impact all districts equally since some of them you will build a lot more than others. Its one of the reasons the seowon is so good, 50% cost for a campus is a lot more valuable than 50% cost for a commercial hub or encampment for instance."

The acropolis is actually a really damn good unique, so good that it is arguably strategy defining for the greek civ as a whole. The biggest bonus it gets is just the fact you can get easy adjacency on it, compared to the base theatre square which is really hard to get adjacency on. 

An important thing to point out though is that all unique districts are good because of the halved base cost to build them which is actually nuts and lets you take advantage of district discounts much easier.

I dont want to go into depth explaining but my own tier list would probably be this:

**S**: Seowon, Hansa, Lavra

**A**: Acropolis, Suguba, Ikanda, Cothon

**B**: RND, Bath

**C**: Mbanza, Street Carnival

Your culture output is your defensive tourism... your tourism output is offensive tourism. 

If OP wants to delay China from winning they need to try to maximize the culture output of the person who has the most culture. If its you then you can directly impact this. If not try to get a cultural aliance with the person generating the most culture so you can boost it higher for them.

The other way is by hurting China's tourism output, war will definitely do this but its not always possible to do that. You can send spies to steal their great works and gold which will hurt them whilst boosting you.

Also Rock bands do nothing to slow down another player from winning tourism, they only speed up your own tourism win because they just generate a burst of tourism (which is offensive, not defensive) to the civ where you used it."
