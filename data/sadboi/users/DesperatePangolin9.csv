Construction,flgh18j,t3_fopjuj,1585142366.0,"Painting Contractor here, just started with a company after a slow winter because I needed coin. Can confirm, coughing old people crammed in one house, no running clean water, overflowing jonny on the spot and no sanitizer to be found. Hands not being washed nor mouths covered.

 I decided to not go in today. The idiocy is giving me an ulcer and doing a reclusive job like painting is mental anguish when you hear 60 year old painter Janet dry coughing her lungs out 4 ft from you. Hoping I can get the emergency fund as my 2 other part time jobs reduced my hours to 0 as they where in the food sector and I was somewhat new.

It's not worth it. I have an immuno surpressed sister, lung cancer survivor dad and bad asthma myself.

I would fight for EI and claim people around you where visibly sick and not self isolating. That is what I am doing because it is the truth at this point.

Ask yourself this - is a few weeks money worth the risk of those you love most? Philosophically speaking, I have long known that what makes me happy, truly, is being close with my loved ones. Being close to nature. All this other economic nonsense is superficial in a time of crisis.. not to say we shouldnt pay it attention, I just think that the resolution is in non-action. Stay home and safe. Construction workers on the low end are often financially dependent on the job and eating will take precidence over there perceived threat of sickness. They have the imminent threat of being starved, within reason. I don't actually think this true though. We're all rather adjusting to a stark reality that most of the things we work for are superficial, dont be a sheep.. a.. sick wheezing sheep"

I just want her to be happy! I think bringing in the bread will do that but instead she seems frustrated on days I have to work and it invokes anxiety within myself. Damned if I do and damned if I do not.

I wonder if there is some post partum depression going on. There very well might. It is a lot of changes and I do respect her but all the same, these happenings really depress me and damper my day. She has strong resentful outbursts in the mornint and when I get home from work. It has amounted to this perpetual feeling of failing her.

Edit: i dont actually hit my cat so her feelings are unjustified. Just letting you know the circle jerk I go through. 6 years together now 

I straight up told her the baby slept for 11 hours and she has no reason to be angry. Her response? Looking at me stupid and mocking my statement about having to work at 430pm so I do not want to be woken up by her hissy fit at 650 am.

I am ready to be a stay at home dad and tell her to go fucking work. What is wrong with society? As a philosopher, it rattles my brain, reflecting on how a toxic society has leaked into my personal life and that imposing any traditional gender role leads to arguments and discontent"
