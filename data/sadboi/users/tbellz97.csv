AskReddit,fqond5y,t1_fgv8z0x,1589519451.0,Look at us now. We all know the feeling
Anxiety,fqaz42o,t3_ghiqy2,1589227770.0,I get this too but is more when I leave work. Every day I think that I messed somthing up or said the wrong thing and that I’m getting fired in the morning. Especially on weekends where I can’t relax cus I’m dreading Monday.
VetTech,fpy0jyx,t1_fpxrjfp,1588993409.0,I don’t know much about that drug but I only wear a mask when measuring it out cus litterally when you open the jar it likes fills the air with the worst tasting dust you can imagine. I’m just a drama queen
VetTech,fpxqaak,t1_fpwqs1t,1588987405.0,I open my mouth and all I can taste is bitter
VetTech,fpiwz29,t1_fpiuvcz,1588650696.0,Omg. That’s insane
VetTech,fpiwxxg,t1_fpisd3t,1588650673.0,All these comments have made me feel a lot better. This one especially

VetTech,fpht5bc,t1_fphfqay,1588627334.0,I’m all about facing my own mistakes I always tell on myself even if it’s somthing that nobody will find out. This was scary tho I just wanted them to fire me cus I felt like that was what I deserved
VetTech,fp665gq,t1_fp4obpl,1588346778.0,People don’t realize that this isn’t how life has always been. Their pets aren’t getting the socialization and practice being alone they need for when this all ends. I predict a lot of shelter overload when this is over
VetTech,fp2vkxu,t3_gaytl4,1588268614.0,Everybody is getting babies!! We’ve had calls every other day about “puppy well checks”??
VetTech,foo35q8,t3_g8jmh1,1587931587.0,I never answer the question of “what made you want to work with animals” with “oh cus I love animals” that is a given and they already know that and have heard it 1000 times. Think of somthing that makes your desire to work with animals unique. All the jobs I’ve ever had were with animals and they always ask that question. I my answer is always along the lines of “I want to educate myself as much as I can about every aspect of animal husbandry because this is what I’m going to be doing the rest of my life”

Justfuckmyshitup,foldxov,t1_fok7d2i,1587860168.0,Sword and scale? Me too! I heard his voice and I was like I gotta see this neck beard for myself- I was not disappointed
Justfuckmyshitup,foitkwp,t1_foitfle,1587796572.0,I don’t get what the thought process was behind this
VetTech,fo6pp4u,t3_g61j18,1587564290.0,For me it’s the people. If there were no owners involved (ie working with wildlife) this job would be a lot easier
relationship_advice,fo5zhms,t1_fo5z90m,1587540924.0,I have a certification to work in a trade witch I am currently working at now. I don’t really want to stay where I’m at I just feel really pushed aside in all these decisions. I’m going to be finatially dependent on him for a while at first because there’s no chance I’m getting a new job in this climate
JustBootThings,fn93n3s,t3_g07p3p,1586758308.0,Who is he?? Is he one of those Adam Calhoun personalities? I need to see more of this cringe
AskReddit,fmsnozf,t1_fmsndbd,1586358958.0,This is exactly what I was hoping to see !
VetTech,fm2vnt6,t3_fspb6b,1585706478.0,I’m In the same boat. it was my family’s ultimatum that I either go to work and not come home or vis versa. My job is understanding but there’s only 2! People on staff not including the doctor and manger. I feel insanely bad but what can you do
relationships,fluc1s1,t1_fltthlw,1585499606.0,What if there’s more to this story that OP isn’t aware of? I don’t wanna discount the fact that she may unknowingly play a role in this. I’ve defiantly been in her shoes and it did end up being my fault
AskReddit,flss4gg,t1_fl0zt0j,1585449426.0,Can you imagine being so desperate for blow that you sell your car on the spot? I bet that was an exceptionally shitty comedown
VetTech,fllzszv,t1_flklxrv,1585271304.0,Looks like a dumbo rat
VetTech,flfqvj4,t1_flc901z,1585114568.0,Oh Jesus .. I almost like when we see people like this. Keeps it interesting
VetTech,flfqq2b,t3_fnul9s,1585114420.0,Rigor Mortis is my thing. Found out a while ago when I picked up a DOA cat and the whole thing came up like a cold dinner plate. Litterally jumped straight into the air and couldn’t go near it
VetTech,flfq8sw,t1_fld1wxk,1585113964.0,That seems a little agressive..
medizzy,flcbnnu,t3_fnqpn7,1585025342.0,Did it feel better after??
unpopularopinion,fjovi4u,t1_fjopjow,1583535658.0,I remember hearing a talk show calling churches and orginizations that were preaching for help to immagrants and homeless ect. They called these groups and pretended that they had an individual in their care that needed shelter/support and all that. They asked the group if anybody was willing to take them in and nobody would do it.
VetTech,fisr718,t1_fis88hm,1582691130.0,I heard that isn’t really palatable but who knows
Cringetopia,fiof8a4,t1_finxjcb,1582582094.0,She was at the glasses store and saw that pair and was like “this is it- these are the ONE”
VetTech,fi98qrd,t1_fi8vtzh,1582258403.0,The people that we have to clear the hallways and lobbies for so they can be pulled by their flexi-leash to the exam room>>>
DiWHY,fi47msr,t1_fi3rtcb,1582135602.0,There’s a man in that couch!
VetTech,fi1w32j,t1_fh4pjft,1582065972.0,I feel like goldens and labs are marketed as these chill family dogs when I’m actuality they’re still working dogs!!
VetTech,fi1w026,t1_fgysoay,1582065922.0,This is kind of late but the idea that people even own huskies in climates like that infuriates me
forbiddensnacks,fhzvfzl,t1_fhy9fjs,1582013550.0,Why does lush display the masks like this? Do they change them out every day? Is it out for people to sample and if so how do you sample a face mask in a store? I have so many questions about this
AskReddit,fhk5rmo,t1_fhij2b0,1581668095.0,My coworker did this to me the other day. Not exactly with trash but with an amputated dog tail while I was on the phone with a client. Needless to say I had to hang up the phone (I work at a vet hospital)
shittyfoodporn,fh9h3hj,t3_f1uzve,1581381173.0,I would absolutely eat that. Jalapeños and cheese are the best on fries
WTF,fh6veua,t1_fh6srxw,1581307086.0,Would you do this to almost 200$ boots?
AskReddit,fh5uktc,t3_f1avnb,1581292456.0,Disney merchandise.
WTF,fh5u5fc,t1_fh57kd0,1581292313.0,Unfortunately I think those are really expensive “moon boots”  wasteful.

VetTech,fgy4eki,t1_fgves9i,1581179408.0,This is a perfect example. I really don’t understand why we don’t emphasize the exercise needs of animals to clients right off the bat rather than just handing them trazadone no questions asked. Apperently it’s “ not our place to tell them”
VetTech,ff1pv5m,t1_ff1k82j,1579483528.0,That “my doctor” sh**t drives me INSANE. Your not special- if your dog needs to be seen your gonna get who you get
VetTech,fe58106,t1_fe4mcrs,1578866435.0,I know it sounds like I’m overselling myself. I think that they just don’t have room for me anywhere now. I sort of just float around helping all areas of the hospital rather than having a specific job title. That’s what is bugging me. Who knows Maby that will be helpful in the long run
Celiac,f8wh4wz,t3_e2h96g,1574890684.0,It’s corn. I drink it all the time and never have issues

oddlyterrifying,f19zg0u,t1_f19x9cw,1569281823.0,This video is pretty old. The horse flips over on her because she dosent let it catch it’s balance and it lands right on top of her. I heard she shattered her pelvis
Psoriasis,evq680t,t1_evq61h8,1564687204.0,I was desperate for a glimmer of hope that they could be removed. I wasn’t waiting lol
Psoriasis,evq5die,t1_evndsli,1564686712.0,I tried the oil last night after posting this- soaked my scalp in olive oil for an hour or so and then used a comb to at least try to break it up. I ended up getting a decent amount out but it still took some hair- but it worked!
Psoriasis,evndles,t1_evndbok,1564623094.0,Was your hair coming out when you tried to remove them before that? My issue is when I pull or comb a scale out all the hair that it’s grown around comes out
