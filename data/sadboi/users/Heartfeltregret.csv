medizzy,fpsbmol,t1_fpf3hs4,1588870737.0,That’s like people who own big cats. Like sure the cat probably does love you and wouldn’t intentionally hurt you. But when she plays with you in the exact same way a house cat would she might actually rip your arm off.
medizzy,fpsb936,t1_fpcj5vw,1588870556.0,"Well - sharks don’t really attack people. Normally their just curious and kinda checking you out. Some are more curious than others and bite- which do to their size results in things like this; but you could hardly call it an “attack”.

The demonization of sharks since the release of jaws is really quite tragic. Fear mongering about the animals was used as a marketing strategy for the initial release and has since then had a massive negative impact on the public’s view of them. Sharks are not bloodthirsty monsters, they’re beautiful and fascinating creatures. 

We need to remember that the ocean is not our domain, and when we enter it we effectively leaving our world. We cannot blame animals for being curious about or even frightened by us. Sharks just like any other animal and should be given space and respect."

As soon as we discovered how we could exploit them we’ve been utilizing them to our benefits with no regard for their comfort and happiness. We kept human slaves legally all over the world for thousands of years. You’re kidding yourself if you believe we ever gave the smallest consideration to the animals well being.

If you personally own a couple breeding cows and just drink the excess milk when it’s available that’s one thing - but as soon as someone is relying the animals for income exploitation is *inevitable*. This is proven time and time again and you’re absolutely deceiving yourself if you say otherwise. it’s not pessimistic, it’s merely recognizing the reality.

TheBullWins,fp7n0g2,t1_fp7dx3s,1588373722.0,"Regardless of how the meat industry actually works and regardless of the fact that unless you are at a farm all day every day watching how the animals are being cared for 100% of the time, you can’t possibly know that they’re being treated “””ethically””””. there’s no meat or dairy farm that could be philosophically 
If I killed you- not out of necessity but just because I find you delicious(which, according to real cannibals, you are) and I want to eat you, would you care that I prayed for you? Would that make you feel better? No, it wouldn’t. You were slaughtered and eaten. The only reason to “show respect for the animal” is to make YOU feel better. It does nothing for the sentient creature you just ate. She’s dead. Just like [150 billion ](https://thevegancalculator.com/animal-slaughter/) other animals. 

Deer populations are intentionally grown by organizations who profit off of hunting licenses. They use such environmentally destructive methods as creating clearings that they gather in and removing predators. This is not natural. 

Our gluttony is so great that we are literally [killing our planet ](https://climatenexus.org/climate-issues/food/animal-agricultures-impact-on-climate-change/). We have utterly [corrupted](https://www.ciwf.org.uk/media/3818904/welfare-of-broilers-in-the-eu.pdf)  the natural world to produce as much product as possible. It’s *absolutely absurd* to try and defend farming with an argument from naturalism.

Regardless - Just because something is natural doesn’t make it okay. You’re clearly wealthy enough to afford these incredibly high end meats which means you aren’t eating them out of necessity. There are people who literally can’t buy fancy meat, or raise animals, or hunt or go vegan due to where they live and/or their economic status. If you’re so privileged as to have that choice it is not ethical to eat meat. You’re choosing to cause unnecessary suffering for the sake your own pleasure and that’s that. The natural world is brutal, yes, but we are able to choose kindness and compassion. 

I wish I could keep talking to you about this but I honestly find this topic to upsetting to continue. The most I can hope is for something I’ve said to maybe influence you to give this some more thought and inspire you to do further research. It took a lot of time and soul searching for me...."
TheBullWins,fp6ra5q,t1_fp6ku2k,1588357234.0,"Yeah, that’s better than eating the standard American diet, but we should always seek to do better. I think hunting and to a lesser extent raising your own animals is the second most ethical way to eat meat^(the best would be freeganism - which I highly recommend looking into) since you’re not supporting the meat industry. 

It’s not possible to kill someone who doesn’t want to be killed with ‘dignity’. It’s not possible to breed animals specifically to die ethically. It’s not possible to breed animals to spend their lives in a constant cycle of pregnancy, birth, then immediately having their babies taken ethically. And even if it were they all go to the same slaughter houses. If you’ve seen any footage from these facilities i can’t imagine you’d say they are anything resembling ethical. How they die has nothing to do with the farm they grew up on. They’re smart animals and they know exactly what’s gonna happen; they know that whoever gets forced onto that truck never comes home.

WTF,fp6nqtl,t1_fp6m78f,1588355493.0,"Sorry if I came off like I was saying it’s safe to keep them, I’m absolutely, staunchly opposed to keeping these animals as pets; I couldn’t tell the species but yeah, this lil guy is probably going to be pretty big one day and with that, less scared of confrontation. 

i just felt the original comment read like “all pet monkeys eventually go wild and become aggressive” which isn’t accurate. I concur with everything you wrote. I sincerely hope this animal ends up with an organization that can give them the safest and happiest life possible. “Exotic pet” breeding is sick and should be considered a felony, from my perspective."

WTF,fp6gkr8,t1_fp6b8v1,1588351977.0,"Well first of all, I’ll say that you’re certainly right that wild animals are not good pets. Monkeys don’t adapt well to being kept as pets and often become “moody”; scratching, biting and generally being destructive like particularly wild toddlers. BUT their still animals. Normal, healthy animals don’t just become spontaneously aggressive and murderous. Monkeys are skittish creatures, as you can see here the dog easily tells the monkey off. It won’t just go rabid due to some “wild instincts” - especially considering that monkeys don’t even act that way in the wild.

Monkeys aren’t apes and monkey behavior is not accurately comparable to ape behavior; even in apes, the known cases of pet apes attacking people was due to their human’s improper care^(not to say it’s ever good to keep an ape as a pet, it’s absolutely not)such as the case where the chimp ripped off a person’s face. Sandra Herold, the owner had given him tea laced with Xanax, which she was unaware causes psychosis and a host of other mental side effects in chimps. The term “apeshit” came from us observing the aggressive behavior non-human apes often show eachother and all perceived threats, not directed at humans in particular."
