Anxiety,fgda9jt,t3_exvij5,1580680408.0,"I‚Äôm really sorry you had this experience. I‚Äôm an RN that works in a hospital and I have the same issue advocating for my patients that have anxiety. Doctors do not want to prescribe benzo‚Äôs because of the effects they can have on people if they DO rely on them too much. Which...I understand, but I think instead of avoiding this all together, they should explain what it can cause and/or maybe show videos of people that this has happened to. Doctors, however, are much more likely to prescribe SSRI‚Äôs. The doctor that you were talking to sounds like she sucked entirely though. She failed to weigh out your options or explain anything to you. Not every doctor is going to be like this. I recommend either going to a psychiatrist (they are not afraid to prescribe meds for anxiety) OR try going to another doctor that has better reviews. Also, you should pan out what you want from them as far as medication. Do you want an SSRI? Buspirone? Xanax? Ativan? Also, how much propranolol did she prescribe you? Is it to be taken regularly or as needed? Propranolol can be helpful, so try to not completely disregard it if you can. It‚Äôs definitely not like taking Xanax when you‚Äôre having an anxiety attack, but it‚Äôs better than nothing and I really good solution if you have to be at work or drive. Please don‚Äôt give up on talking to a doctor about anxiety! As someone that talks to doctors all day, it is not personal. A lot of doctors just suck, and it sounds like you went to someone that sucks. :) You will have better luck with another doctor!! Promise!"

I‚Äôm sure that she doesn‚Äôt mean to put your compliments down, it just seems like maybe she was 1) conditioned to think otherwise and 2) it has become hard for her to ACCEPT a compliment because she feels like she‚Äôs not allowed to agree. 
Maybe there are also things you could do to help her make her feel better about herself. Like for instance, I always feel better after I get waxed, get my nails done, or get my hair done. It‚Äôs not necessarily that she NEEDS these things to feel beautiful, it just might give her an extra boost of confidence because it feels good to take care of yourself. Also, (I‚Äôm sure you are but) always make sure your compliments are genuine. Mostly because that is something that can not be faked.
