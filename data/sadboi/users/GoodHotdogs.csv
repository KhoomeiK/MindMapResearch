WhitePeopleTwitter,fq8l0pw,t1_fq8job8,1589168682.0,"It’s a bit like a poop joke. While it is untrue, lazy, and cringeworthy, I find it humorous because it’s a joke about a common stereotype. 

The same goes for something like Family Guy, the show makes tons of race and sex jokes which can be offensive but they can also be humorous. 

The joke is simple minded and a bit easy but that doesn’t necessarily make it unfunny. 

It really isn’t necessary to take a comedy high ground on this one when the original post is light hearted and unrealistic. 

And I noticed you downvoted my comment. You have the right to do so but the downvote isn’t meant to be a “disagree” button, but whatever"

I’m suggesting something for a future update that makes better use of the in game tools (the nukes). I’m not commenting on your posts saying that the devs and players say that there shouldn’t be goblins. My idea is that the game shouldn’t be limited to medieval fantasy. 

If you’re seriously getting upset at this discussion you have some reflecting to do"
Worldbox,fn1q391,t1_fn1pb08,1586567496.0,"But who says the races shouldn’t use them? You? At a certain point, civilization stops developing. I’m suggesting a way the game can keep progressing.

OculusQuest,fn0l48k,t3_fyf9e9,1586543938.0,"Collision seems to be a bit buggy. If you stab a dummy, the metal clashing sound plays on repeat as they flail around on the ground endlessly.

 My hands seem to flip through walls a bit too. It can be a bit challenging to get my character to get his whole body over a wall but I might just have to get used to it. 

The katana doesn’t seem to stick itself into the bodies of the enemies as easily. The crowbar doesn’t either. 

Overall, this is still one of my favorite quest games. Thanks for all of your hard work 


Also, It would be cool to see an enemy with a melee weapon. I’d love to see this become the blade and sorcery of oculus quest."
