I went on sick leave about two weeks before I had my kid, but in order to do so I had to provide a letter from my midwife. However I definitely got the impression that if I’d said I felt done sooner than I did, my midwife would have made it happen. But I had gestational diabetes and PIH, so especially with the hypertension my midwife and doc were like ‘you’re done’. Given that you’re not due for a few more months you will be able to see how you feel as things progress.

If you go into labour before your due date, your manager should be able to revise your paperwork accordingly. I put in my paperwork that my EDD was the 15th, but ended up having my kid on the 2nd. So once I was home I let my manager know and he said he’d put in the adjusted PAR. Check with them for what the proper procedure is these days though because my experience was a few years ago.

Afraid I can’t help with the PSAC questions since that isn’t my union but perhaps someone can chime in with that info.

Good luck :)"

After that the challenges that face the community (and the territory as a whole) are much more apparent. Some people who come up to work burn out, others thrive.

A colleague put it to me this way - you have housing, a job, and a social group. Only one of these things can suck at any one time, so if your job sucks but you have good friends and like your apartment, cool. If you love your job and find it worthwhile but don’t have many friends, that can also work. But once two out of the three are out of whack, that’s when the burnout clock starts ticking.

But there are lots of opportunities up here, and if you’re interested, poke around in r/nunavut for a bit. If you want to look at jobs, google ‘government of nunavut job postings’ and you’ll get the territorial gov’t jobs page. I love it here and I expect to stay here for quite a few more years :)"
