You might even drink again ( I hope you don’t need to ) but eventually you’ll chain together another set and go for triple digits.  It gets so much easier they longer you go without alcohol.  It’s draw and its promises are never solve any problems it either wants you to drown out or that it carries with it.  Only you can do that and it’s so much easier without a hangover and an empty checking account. 

I went a month at a time a few times ... then did 3 months, then 6 months and every time I went back I fell in harder. “ But is you can go 6 months without a drink, you don’t have a problem, celebrate your sobriety by drinking just a few this weekend”. Is what the voice would tell me.  WRONG ... FUCKING LIAR.  You’ve joined this sub, you’ve come here and maybe even posted,  there’s no magical wave that washes over you and will save you from your own intentions. Just remember how you’ve felt recently and you wouldn’t have that if you weren’t trying to make yourself better, be it good or bad it’s your life trying to come back to you. 

HMU if you’re struggling this time.  We’re here for you. 

I will not drink with you today."

depression,f0dkq7g,t1_f0b1z1f,1568555353.0,"I disagree ... You have to find happiness wherever it presents itself.  From the smallest little interactions with people, to the most trivial of daily accomplishments.  You brushed your teeth, did the laundry AND made food for yourself? Pat yourself on the back buddy because you're making progress. Just keep stacking those successes on top of each other and if you are living life and engaging it on your own terms, comfortably and happily then people will notice.  No one loves a workaholic who never takes care of themselves."
depression,f0djv7m,t1_f0anwh3,1568555031.0,"Let me share something with I’ve come to realize after many years fighting the feelings, urges, tendencies and difficulties these illness' can present. 

Whatever you accomplish in life is your own success, be proud of it and don't compare yourself to others, it's not a measure of your own efforts. 

That being said, your anxiety and stress will be there if you are a CEO of a successful business and wealthy beyond your wildest imaginations or if you pack bags at a grocery store.  Your anxiety, depression and everything else are your minds responses to external stimuli and will adapt. 

It's up to you to learn how to overcome them and respond accordingly.  It's going to take time, there's no magical set of circumstances or advice that will see you through your own struggles.  Just know that there are people out here who have had similar ones and we're still keeping on. 

But I could also be wrong, felt worth saying though."
discgolf,f05e8kh,t1_f05d0b2,1568407808.0,"I think it's easier to count through 9 or 18 hours this way. Shoot your round. Figure out agreed on course par or posted course par after.  

For instance both local courses we frequent and play league on play as all par 3's despite ""posted"" par 4's here and there. The one 10 hole course, anything 6 under playing all par 3's is a great score. The 18 ... Anything 10 under. 

Play the par you're comfortable with. But a straight ahead 340 hole is not a par 4 if you're seasoned."

I'm lactose intolerant so anything spicier with cheese on top of it boils out of my rear end like a middle school science fair volcano.  My girlfriend has learned it's better for everyone in the general vicinity to not allow this combination. 

Cause I'll just dump whatever I'm feeling in the mood for and to hell with the repercussions ... That's future me's problem."

stopdrinking,ezuol19,t1_ezukdo0,1568157322.0,"Naw you don't ... But being sober really gets easier the more days you string together.  And if it comes to another drink, one is too many and a million will never be enough. 

Something that always keeps reminding me is something someone told me here.  You tried the drunk life and it clearly didn't work, give the sober one a try and see what else you can fill your time with. 

I've picked up rc cars again, read a few more books, bought a bike and been riding it, working out here and there, been playing in a local disc golf league as well as throwing with a lot of great friends ( who happen to be alcoholics ) spending more time with family, even drawing and painting again.  

It's been a good year overall ... Looking forward to seeing how the second one ends up you know?"
