I‚Äôve been telling my kids to wash their hands before eating and any other time they‚Äôre able to while at school (ones in kindergarten so it‚Äôs a little difficult and germy to being with).

Maybe a little obsessive... but I‚Äôm trying to keep us all safe and it‚Äôs become second nature pretty quickly.

It didn‚Äôt change anything between us, if anything they‚Äôve become more supportive because they actually educated themselves on bipolar... I am very grateful for these women. 

My parents were interesting. My dads a quiet one, we‚Äôve never really gone into detail about my struggles, not even suicide attempts... instead he‚Äôll show up at the psych hospital and talk about the weather. I know he‚Äôs trying hard to be there for me but has no idea where to start. And I kind of love the simplicity of it. My mom on the other hand took it on as her problem. She never ‚Äúwanted a bipolar child‚Äù and prayed that she would have a healthy baby but god must of not listened. She‚Äôs had to go to therapy herself and now, pretty much everyday she has a new ‚Äúbipolar cure‚Äù that the doctors are unaware of. She is a HUGE help with my kids when I need it (which is a lot lately) but sometimes I feel like it‚Äôs only so she can be praised for everything she does afterwards. 

My oldest was almost 13 and I‚Äôve been fairly open with her throughout a lot of this. Of course she told her friends, who then told their mothers, but honestly they‚Äôve been amazing. I was worried they wouldn‚Äôt trust me with their kids but they acknowledged, genuinely asked how they could help, and it‚Äôs never been brought up again. I get reminded from time to time that they‚Äôre always there to help. 

The hardest one was my husband. I‚Äôve been with him since I was 20, he‚Äôs step dad to my daughter. We‚Äôve been through hell back back together. He watched me completely fall apart after our son was born. He was my rock throughout all this, the hospitalizations, the psychosis... but as soon as a what I was going through was given a name our relationship drastically changed. It‚Äôs like something inside him died. He become cold, distant, mean, frustrated. Any struggle I have is now met with an emotionless ‚Äútake your meds‚Äù. He has a look of never ending disappointment on his face. He‚Äôs tried to have me committed several times over the past year. It ruined us. 

Unfortunately there is a lot of stigma surrounding bipolar because I think it‚Äôs so misunderstood. Its a sad answer, but I would only tell those you feel you should know and who can hopefully be supports in your life. 

TLDR: You‚Äôll get a mix of responses. Your loved ones will hopefully want to educate themselves and support you.

I had the best sleep if my life. In the morning I was getting my breakfast and felt like I was going to pass out. Nurses caught my blood pressure dropping. This terrified me and I vowed never to touch the stuff again. 

Fast forward a few months and I‚Äôm in such a horrible mixed state I text my pdoc BEGGING for it. I took half this time (12.5mg-instant release) and was completely fine. I only take as needed now but it‚Äôs literally saved my life numerous times. 

I did a lot of research about the dying part and the strongest correlation I could find was it being over prescribed in hospitals for sleep when patients were already on a cocktail of dangerous meds prone to bad interactions with Seroquel. Your pharmacist will be about to check to make sure everything you‚Äôre taking interacts safely together. In fact, they probably wouldn‚Äôt have filled your prescription if their was a high chance of bad interactions. (Not sure where you are-this is my experience in Canada).

bipolar2,ffbfvd6,t3_esp27h,1579763470.0,"When I first started lamictal I developed a rash once I hit 100mg. Everyone freaked out. My psychiatrist didn‚Äôt think it looked like ‚Äúthe rash‚Äù but still took me off of it cold turkey. 

I tried several different meds over the next 6 months and eventually begged my psychiatrist to let me try it again because I felt like it had the most potential with the least side effects. 

I started taking it again in October, this like much slower and again, developed another rash at 100mg. This time I was sent to the ER where a dermatologist confirmed it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe rash‚Äù. Turns out there‚Äôs just something about it that makes me a little itchy and I tend to get a small rash. 

The dermatologist explained a lot about Stevens Johnson‚Äôs Syndrome and really put me at ease. I live in a major city, and this was at the top rated hospital. This dermatologist had never seen anyone with SJS from lamictal in her 25 years of working there. 

So yes, the bad rash is EXTREMELY rare. And just because you get a rash while taking lamictal doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs one you need to worry about (but obviously check to be sure). You need to watch out for blisters and they typically start in your mouth or groin area. They‚Äôre very distinct (google pictures to know what to watch for). And if this does happen to you .. you get medical treatment and stop taking it ASAP before it has a chance to get bad. 

I‚Äôm still taking lamictal, I‚Äôm finally at 150mg and am not nervous about the rash whatsoever.

The uncontrollable jerking movements sound horrible though :( I wonder what causes it?"
BipolarReddit,ff3p29b,t3_erfufu,1579545793.0,"I‚Äôm on 100mg of Lamictal and every time I increase the dose I feel a little nauseous and tired. Maybe for a day or two max. 
The worst i felt was probably the initial start of the meds at 25mg, but every increase since then has been easier.  However, the benefits do take a while to show up! 
I would voice your concerns with your doctor (or even pharmacist), they‚Äôll help answer any questions you have. I would assume now that it‚Äôs in your system, an increase won‚Äôt be as hard on you. 
Hope you get to feeling better!"
Psychosis,ff1tu0t,t3_er4rt0,1579486044.0,"My heart hurt reading your story. I too experienced postpartum psychosis with the birth of my son. He was my second child and after he was born I had debilitating anxiety and wound up in the hospital pretty quickly. I learnt I was also experiencing psychosis. 

He just turned 5, I was hospitalized a second time for psychosis almost a year ago. I left with a bipolar diagnosis. 

I feel like I‚Äôm missing so much and am so scared I‚Äôll loose it at any moment. 

I have found that basic self care (eating healthy/regular meals, enough sleep, enough water, some form of exercise) helps keep me somewhat stable. I‚Äôm overly sensitive to any and all drugs now. Even too much caffeine can make me manic. 

Also, meds. If you‚Äôre not feeling stable, don‚Äôt feel nervous to talk to your psychiatrist about changing things up. 

You‚Äôre going through so much but I sense just how much your little boy means to you. You are a good mom, you are taking care of you. That‚Äôs what he needs you to do :)"

I‚Äôm experiencing something similar right now, I‚Äôve been complaining about feeling numb for months and now I just feel an overwhelming urge to cry all the time. 

Little upsets have been turning into full on meltdowns. Is wish it wasn‚Äôt for hard for us :("
bipolar,fecxzpb,t3_eob33u,1578989217.0,"This made me tear up. I‚Äôm the bipolar mom who tries her best to get out of bed and give my kids all I can. I always spend time taking in every single cuddle in the mornings... we might hide out in bed longer than we should but starting a new day is always painful. 

My daughter is 13 and struggling with some mood issues. My son is 5 and her just adores her. He can‚Äôt wait to wake up and jump into her bed. He loves to listen and to her, learn from her, be involved with her however he can despite the age difference. He‚Äôs constantly trying to make her laugh and can usually help get her going in the mornings. All he wants is her love and attention every single day. 

Your little sister loves you. I‚Äôm sure you are her world, just as my daughter is to my son. There‚Äôs something about being the older sibling, the younger one simply adores you. Soak up that love. It‚Äôs so pure."

I hope you listen to what your body‚Äôs telling you it needs. If you need time to yourself, take it. People don‚Äôt always understand but you need to take care of you. 

I also hope in the coming days/weeks you do something for yourself that you wouldn‚Äôt normally do. Something that makes you feel alive. You obviously have people that care about you, I know it can feel empty, but spend time with them. Make new memories. Slowly life changes, it always does. 

My thoughts are with you on your birthday."

I don‚Äôt feel lamotrigine has been doing much for me other than making me feel numb. I was sick over Christmas, missed a few doses but felt a little happier and energetic again. 

Since then I‚Äôve gone from 150mg to 75mg... and it‚Äôs sooo tempting to just keep lowering it. I‚Äôm just terrified I‚Äôll end up in a mixed state and rush to up my dose again. 

I‚Äôd just keep a close watch on how your mood is changing. Enjoy feeling good :)"
bipolar2,fdieyih,t3_elit0u,1578441380.0,"Yup! Or a variation of this. 

My psychiatrist said ‚Äúfor someone who wants to die you always seem to look attractive‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt know how to take this. 

I‚Äôm offended because, fuck you unprofessional dr. But am I supposed to look like I‚Äôm on deaths doorstep to be taken seriously? I have two kids, it takes every ounce of energy in me to ‚Äúlook together‚Äù for school pick up and drop off... and that‚Äôs what he sees."

BipolarReddit,fde9lak,t3_ekwfw9,1578334192.0,"I have two children and yes, it‚Äôs incredibly hard. Not just typical mom hard that everyone complains about but sometimes near impossible - not to freak you out, this is my experience. 

I had my daughter at 18 and spend the next 8 years almost entirely hypomanic (undiagnosed at the time). Upside to this, I was the best mom ever. I was a single parent who could do EVERYTHING. I had my son 5 years ago, pregnancy was rough, I was extremely agitated and paranoid. I was hospitalized within months of having him due to psychosis. 

The last 5 years have been hell. I cannot be the mom I used to be/need to be. I do the bare minimum to get through the day. I was diagnosed bipolar exactly a year ago but looking back it all makes sense. I‚Äôve been sedated most of this year. 

I feel immense guilt over the possibility of passing this excruciating existence onto my children. I worry that I‚Äôm ruining their lives and causing them pain and trouble later in life. 

If I had known I was bipolar, I would have chosen not to have children. I probably would have adopted but those children would still need a functional mother. However, my children are my world. I wouldn‚Äôt change anything now. I‚Äôm happy I didn‚Äôt know so I had a chance to know these beautiful souls. I just need to be better. 

Bottom line, it will be hard. You‚Äôll need support. And that support with need backup support. I believe it‚Äôs doable and I believe we can be healthy, loving parents. I would 100% make sure you‚Äôre set up with a solid healthcare team. Talk it through with them, create a plan. 

Best of luck :)"
Psychosis,fde753t,t3_ekrl2o,1578332650.0,"Forgive me if I‚Äôm reading this wrong, but it doesn‚Äôt sound like your husband has truly been on any type of med long enough to see any benefit. 

First, I would go with your husband to initial appointments and demand two things; a consistent, long term psychiatrist and therapist. Health professionals that continue to send him in different directions do more harm than good. He‚Äôs starting over every single time a switch is made. 

Second, stress the importance of involving you in his care plan. You should have an understanding of what he‚Äôs going through, how to help him and a safety plan that he creates with you. (You have his written consent that if x,y,z happens, he‚Äôs to go to the hospital etc)

Consistent medication is HUGE and is unfathomable why a psychiatrist would prescribe something without it holding your husband over until his next appointment. It‚Äôs backwards and cruel and unravels any progress he could be making. 

As for self soothing and coping skills, the first thing that came to mind was DBT. It‚Äôs not always very accessible and requires group participation which is super rewarding but possibly too much at the moment? There are also DBT workbooks that you two could complete at home. It‚Äôs been amazing to help me self regulate and feel a little more at ease in my body and with my mind. 

Lastly, hang in there. Don‚Äôt forget about you. I can feel your love and concern for your husband and it truly sounds like he‚Äôs being tossed around within the system. To say it‚Äôs horrible is an understatement. But please, take care of yourself. Caregiver burnout is real. Utilize any help you can and be damn clear with the healthcare team that this is NOT working. 

All the best."
