Anxiety,ez1d11l,t3_czqtqt,1567646981.0,"Yep. Diarrhea every freaking morning from it, not able to eat for days, always sick to my stomach. Now I take an anxiety med and anti-depressant. And smoke a shit ton of weed. I can finally eat, but the meds cause constipation, This is why I hate my life uggh."
