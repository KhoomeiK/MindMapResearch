depression,fqtghf0,t3_gkp5b0,1589638526.0,"I relate to you. My father was gifted, and he continued to be brilliant throughout his whole life. My mother was also accomplished academically. Me being their first child at the time, a lot of people expected a lot of me since I was born. But unlike my father, I didn't start talking at one year old nor did I build complex buildings out of stuff when I was 4. I was normal. 

So I wasn't a genius, but school was easy for me. I attribute that to my mom who taught me how to read quite early. People in school praised me, and I was happy, so I tried harder. For the first time in my life, I was special in a good way. So I got this idea that if I did well in school I would finally matter... That was my mistake. 

I was a top performing student my whole life, until I couldn't fool myself anymore that people actually cared about me as a person and not their own expectations of me. 

Midway in, I gave up college. Of course, I did terribly, and I also acted terribly tbh. My whole life I knew I was different and had to try to just be normal, and I couldn't take it anymore. Everything fell apart, and friends... Family... Teachers, everyone who would always say I'd do great things in the future, none cared about me when I fell. It was by my own doing yes, but I lost them when I needed them the most. I grew to resent why should I try so hard to be accepted when some people were loved simply for existing? I almost killed myself a few times. It was the darkest time of my life and I couldn't see a few meters... Or rather days, ahead of me, it was just dark. But then I pulled myself together and decided I was going to live my own damn life. 

I decided I was going to live my own life. It might've been horrible, I might've hated myself, but I decided I won't abandon me. I found some work, got enough money to continue my education (I was disowned when I almost flunked out), got my degree, got better work,  saved money, made investments. I still want to die sometimes, but now I know I won't die homeless and starving... 

Maybe my mentality of living only for myself wasn't the best, but it got me out of the abyss when nobody would pull me out of it. Now I do care about people again but not to the extent that I'd twist myself into a tangle expecting things from them again. If you have to scale down your expectations for a bit to make things easier for yourself, it's okay to do that even if other people think differently. They might think less of you, but so what? You're the one going through this after all. Will their words do your work for you? Nah. Only you can do it. You're great to make it this far, the effort you put didn't just evaporate into thin air because you're struggling. The distance you traveled wouldn't be reversed because you're stumbling, you'll just take some more time, maybe do some detour, but you're still walking and that's a fact! Even if you stop for a while, doesn't mean you're giving up or that you won't continue again. So good luck, pal, and give yourself a breather, think about how you want to go about this and whether you want to continue, or take a different path, not because of others, but because it's what you want for yourself."
AskReddit,fqt9xhx,t3_gkpda1,1589634207.0,"So I went outside for walks at night sometimes, it's not the best habit but I figured it was alright to do that again because I moved to a gated complex. But I was wrong. 

One day I went back from a walk and found a stranger in the fountain/garden circle, and he was looking at me as I got closer. I won't say I know everyone in the neighborhood, but I know a lot of people and their families because I'm part of the women's association, and yet I never even saw this guy. He could be a guest, sure, but he struck me as odd even from a distance. He was just standing still in the fountain in the middle of the night, so that's odd enough, but he also looked unstable to me; his eyes were red, he looked like he hadn't showered for a while and his clothes were full of stains. Did one of the neighbors go through a rough patch or something, I thought, but I haven't heard anything like that. I decided to walk the long way around. We kept our eyes on each other, then out of nowhere he started screaming. 

I couldn't tell what he was saying, but it sounded horrible. He was really angry, or sad, or whatever intense emotion it was. So I bolted, and he ran after me. He stopped screaming as he was chasing me, instead he got out a knife. I honestly thought I'd die if he caught me. I ran the fastest I had ever run in my life, but I didn't run straight home, I didn't want him knowing where exactly I live! So I jumped over fences trespassing into other people's properties, which was a horrible decision in hindsight, but I didn't think that far at the time. Got home and hid in my second story, up all night. I belatedly realized I might have invited disaster upon my neighbors, but I didn't have the guts to get out again. 

In the morning I immediately went to look for the security to find out what the shit had happened last night. Security said there had been complaints about some ruckus and asked me about it, yeah that was probably me. But they didn't find any guy when they investigated last night, though apparently some people did see someone running... But probably me, not the guy I described. They looked for him for sometime, did night patrols, but nothing. To this day I still have no idea who that was and what was up with him, and I stopped going for night walks."

At the same time, it's also easier to not think so far ahead, for the example about what to do after you graduate, because that's very distracting, and instead just take the days/weeks/months as they come, being as efficient as you need to to lessen your own burden. In that case, you can also see working hard as some kindness you can do to yourself, because the world sure ain't going to stop over your plight. That's the key I think, treating the grind as being kind to yourself, I mean you're the one trying to get through higher education, and presumably, you want to see it to the end and don't want the effort spent to go to waste, so what else can you do but do your work for you?"

AskReddit,flkalcq,t3_fp5kk9,1585237265.0,"I was really into this guy and he agreed to date me, but somehow kept rejecting my advances. A month and we barely did anything. Then on the reunion (we were school friends) we went to a hotspring, I was kinda desperate and got myself in a bikini. Everyone looked but him. But then he called me to his room, and we had the best sex in my entire life. Oh all of that pent up frustration just exploded lol, and not just from me. We barely went outside for the rest of the stay. Apparently he wasn't sure I really wanted him until then, which is amazing, because damn what?"

I have a similarly sized gap in my house and could never get through because my head gets stuck, my head isn't even that big... I gotta try again."

depression,flg9joo,t3_fojaa1,1585136001.0,"I went through the same thing, but I pushed through it with sheer effort. I had to accept I was dumb and had to tailor my approach to learning. I spent a *lot* of time reading ahead of my class so that I could get a comprehensive look at the subject, made a giant summary and marked everything down, down to the book, page and line number. That really helped shorten the time required to do my course works. Gathered all the quizzes/tests/exams from everywhere. Bought some books and references too, and started discussing my possible thesis early. Asking help from professors and graduate students along the way. Hope some of that could help you. I never regained my passion for learning, but keeping up could be manageable if you constantly study."
