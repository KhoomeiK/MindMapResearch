Insurance is such a disaster. Not having insurance is an even bigger disaster. I'm lucky to have it but the company that bought the company I work for has what looks like a step above catastrophic plans because I don't live in NJ where they're headquartered."

bipolar,f8sw76k,t1_f8ssn95,1574790476.0,"On the flipside, if I feel like someone is pulling away I can't stand it. I do everything I can to try and put myself back in their line of vision, so to speak. It baffles me that I do it to people but it's not ok at all if I feel someone is doing that to me."

bipolar,f8shg91,t1_f8rqe86,1574780803.0,What do you think this is? Is it a personality flaw we have or bipolar (depressive side) related?
bipolar,f8ru64y,t1_f8rtnsa,1574753317.0,That's it!! What is this?!
bipolar,f8ru50m,t1_f8rppco,1574753275.0,I understand. I'm so lonely sometimes it feels cold in my bones.

bipolar,f3lg2s5,t1_f3gd6mr,1570975540.0,I went! I didn't drink! Kind of - they had Chic-fil-A tea and I drank the F out of that. Thank you for your supportive words!
bipolar,f3fbs7d,t1_f3f6rom,1570894332.0,"This sounds bad but it's true, I don't know who I am.  I'm slowly working on it though! I'm a big Salesforce geek and I know some others that share this will be there so I do have that going for me, which you actually just helped me realize! I have 3 dogs and most people are, at the least, slightly interested in dogs so there's something. Outside of those things, I'm kind of at a loss. Not staying long! An hour tops bc I just don't want to be around alcohol right now. 
These were good tips and I really, really appreciate them!!! üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
bipolar,f1afc8u,t1_f1ado4t,1569292490.0,"I label myself as the most fun bipolar since I hit mixed states in the fall & spring and I'm a rapid cycler (eye rolling, of course). I didn't know what mixed states were until several years ago when my at the time new doctor said, ""Well you're in a mixed state"". 
It's getting the high and the low at the same time. When I'm manic I want to create things and ""do"" stuff. When I'm depressed I can't even think of anything worth creating. In the middle of those, 85% of the time, I'm ok. But in a mixed state I want to create something but then hate the way I started it. It's a different feeling than starting and just stopping. I get the manic part of being SUPER short & irritated with people. It's simultaneously loving and hating something at the same time."
bipolar,f1advoz,t3_d8djpc,1569291412.0,"I've been there. It's awful to feel like this. What's your plan? I do better when I have plans with microsteps like get out of bed, brush my teeth, feed the dogs instead of leaving my husband to do it. I managed to get my GED and I think you can too. 
Give yourself a 3 hour plan. Not 30 days. Thirty days is a long time and it's ok to work up to that. 
Suicide isn't the answer though. It seems you have a support system that cares. Lean on them. If that's not an option, check yourself in to your local hospital. The last time I went the suicide route, I woke up 3 days later from a medically induced coma. When I was awake enough, with a virgin system nonetheless, I felt awful. I let myself down and everyone who gives a single shit about me. But most of all, even though I thought I was worthless, I still felt like I let myself down the most. 
Reach out. You're not alone.

bipolar,ex3qruh,t1_ex2upmx,1565989763.0,"Hang in there! Finding the right cocktail is like being on a roller coaster without any safety gear. It's awful. And nobody understands how awful it is until they've experienced that brand of hell themselves. I was diagnosed when I was 14 and didn't find the right mix of stuff until I was about 20. I'm 40 now and have had to add things here and there. Along with lithium I take neurontin, lamictal, kpin and lunesta. I guess my point is you find a doctor who is about YOU and then work to find what makes you feel better. It's a journey but the alternative isn't an option... I'l answer any questions you have anytime!"
bipolar,ex2tz4d,t1_ex2apzu,1565975267.0,"I know Li isn't for everyone but if you can make it through this initial awful period, it can be a gamechanger. It was for me. I've been on 900 mg for about 10 years. I also take other things but lithium is what everything else is built off. I really, really, really hope it winds up working for you!!"

I turned 40 in April! There were definitely times I didn't think I'd see, or even want to see, the next day. 
I believe we're all stronger than we give ourselves credit for and ANY *healthy* support system is a good one! Virtual, irl, it doesn't matter as long as you know you have people to help you get up when you fall."

This is the kind of night I wish I had a punching bag in the garage to get try and get some stuff out with a physical release. But alas, I do not so I'm doing my ridiculous dipping dot craft instead. Also did a little 10 minute guided meditation that probably helped. *Again I appreciate you reading & replying. :)"
