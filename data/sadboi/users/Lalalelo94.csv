The host makes amazing rum fruit punch style drink so always makes big batches for parties. I noticed the two guys were the only ones not drinking it. To begin with I shrugged it off and we carried on. 

An hour in my friend who could drink anyone under the table said she felt funny and was slurring her speech after a few drinks which was really odd. I'd seen her drink a bottle of whiskey to herself and only appear tipsy. 

I then noticed I felt a bit odd and took the host aside and asked him if he put more booze in the punch than usual or if he'd left anyone alone with it. He said his friends from school helped him make it and they were alone with it. He then got what I was implying and said I was being paranoid. 

I stayed half hour longer and didn't drink and didn't let my friend drink unless it was from a bottle she opened. I then said let's go now as I don't like the situation, let the others know why I was leaving an another couple felt the same and left with us.

Turns out those guys from his school days has spiked the punch and sexual assaulted his sister and another female guest and stole all sorts from the host."
