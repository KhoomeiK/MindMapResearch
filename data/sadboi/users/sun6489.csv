SuicideWatch,fqp3pd7,t3_gjsxjk,1589533914.0,"First of all I want to thank you for sharing your thoughts/inner rants and you are not pathetic to share your pain. Yes it is true that there are people in the world who have way worse (People suffering from diseases, people in refugee camps, children starving etc.) but that does not mean your internal pain is invalid. Trust me it isn't. I don't know what has triggered such painful thoughts in you (frankly I don't know I can even help you even if I know that, I am no trained psychotherapist) but what I can suggest you to change your perception a little. Rather than thinking yourself ugly say to yourself that you are different. It is not a false statement just different representation. (There is no quantifying metric of beauty and humanity have very weird standards of deeming something beautiful)

Now you are saying that you are living a mediocre life (I feel that myself too most of the time) and you want to end it.  What I suggest to you not to end your life but the part which makes your life mediocre. There must be something you think will make your life more awesome than current one. Pick the easiest one of those activities and start researching about it and how to do it. Just try that. You can at least justify to yourself that you tried. Finally I want to say you are brave for coming out with your inner thoughts (Even to the strangers of the internet :) ). You have people who care for you (Even though they have struggle understanding you) and you have intelligence and internet resources and faceless strangers who care about you. I am confident you will do good if you be easy in yourself. Take care of yourself and the people who care for you :) :)"
SuicideWatch,fo47oqa,t1_fo44d77,1587499611.0,You don't have to love yourself. I never understood the expression self love and trust me nobody hates me more than I do. You can try to think what kind of suggestion you will give to your friend if he is in identical situation. We all have the extraordinary power of giving good advice to others. So try it on yourself.
SuicideWatch,fo45fde,t3_g5lb4j,1587498501.0,"Hello Stranger in Reddit. First of all I want to thank you for writing this. Trust me it is very relatable to me. My self destruction methods are different than yours but I doubt they generate any different result than yours. I am in no position to give you any advice so can I give you some suggestions? I hope you will not mind. In recent times I have realised something about other people in my life whom I consider my dearest friend but they never reciprocate as much. The thing I realised that it is not there fault actually. We care too much and the others the so called ""Healthy"" & ""Sound minded"" people can never understand or do that. It is like asking a born blind person to describe a beautiful sunset. They physically can't (Even sometimes a person with good eyesight can't). They can't care as us does not make them bad person per se. But unfortunately as they are the majority in society we get isolated, marginalised and simply laughed of by them. We get hurt again and again, get even bitter,angry and lonely. So my suggestion to you will be don't expect others to show up for you and also that most people really don't care who you are as they are busy with their own life. The expectation of some saviour is just cruel. Maybe try to help others any way you can because very few people have the ability to care like us. You can consider it like some kind of superpower. I do believe the world need people who can truly empathise. We are the outliers in the bell curve. If you are really lucky one day you will have that person in your life who will bring purest joy in your life (Do not leave that person for any trivial reason ever and cherish them). But you can at least try to give your life meaning by yourself. Also don't ever think you are alone. You never know how important people like you (A faceless stranger over internet) are in my life. Knowing there are people in the world who are trying and failing but trying again makes me feel less alone and give me comfort :) :). So good luck friend :)"
SuicideWatch,fo3wund,t3_g5h7ao,1587494299.0,"Hey mate. I am near about your age (22) and I can genuinely relate to you. I know being a disappointment to myself (Don't worry I am not going to say that I have found success and everything and you can too etc etc). I have always assumed that I have disappointed my parents, my teachers and everyone else in my life who I care about. Till this day I only ever had two real friends (My best friend in school and my ex girlfriend who I still love). They eventually lost attachment towards me as there are many more important people in their interesting eventful life so simply they don't have time for me. They are not bad people at all but they just can't be with me. All I have left of them is the memories which are sometimes more painful than joyous.My main point after telling you all of these boring stuff is that you think you are bumming your friends by being coward about girls or what not but actually they really don't care. They have their own problems to worry about and your truest friends and also your parents/family will love you always even though you disappoint them. It is true that there is a  good possibility that they never understand your personal struggle or the pains you endure each moment but they will be there standing beside you. Ending all of this shit does sound like a plan and I will never blame you to think about it (Trust me most of the time I regret being born). But if you end all of it now other than the real person in your life everyone else will always know you as a loser according to your own word. In other hand if you stay and with hard work and lot of luck there is a possibility that you may not remain a ""Loser"" anymore. You may find that person who becomes your friend who thereafter becomes the love of your life and may give you the joy that you deserve. You will never know the answer to this if you just think about ending the whole shit. For people like us (Who has depression) living our life is bravery in itself. So take a chance in yourself :) :)"
SuicideWatch,fo3pu1f,t3_g5ejp3,1587490974.0,"Hello Friend. I can understand this same frustration. I think all of us in here at least faced it one way or another. I know from my personal experience how lonely it is to hear the sentence ""I don't know what to say"" or any other variation of it in any language. The real fact is they really don't know the answer (They are not just capable of it) and sometimes even we do not know what to expect to hear as advice after pouring our heart out. In scientific sense we are the oddballs of humankind. In my opinion it is equivalent to describing a beautiful sunset to a blind person who was born that way. It does not matter how much word or emotion you put into it you can never do justice.  I think you should consider yourself a little lucky than others who at least say to you that ""You can talk to me about anything"" because so many people even don't get that chance."

Python,f131oyj,t3_d79phm,1569151440.0,First of all it is really cool. Now I may be wrong but if you have the prior knowledge of time signature and tempo of the piece by using that information can you not perform zero padding to increase the spectral resolution. I know that it will take a lot more processing time but spectral resolution will increase as per my knowledge.
