NarcissisticAbuse,ff2a8qu,t1_ff29xt7,1579498466.0,I thought it was me when I would catch them in a lie. Almost made me believe that the lie was told for my benefit.
NarcissisticAbuse,ff29u6j,t3_er7v8h,1579498092.0,"I'm so sorry to hear that. I dated a Scorpio for 3 years once. I wouldn't say he was a Narcissist, but he sure lied ALOT."

his zodiac? I'm Cancer and my suspected Narc was a Gemini."
DeadBedrooms,fer7a0w,t1_fer6250,1579350682.0,"He didn't apologize. Things kinda went back to cordial, and that's when he brings up the bag of unwanted gifts. The last part of this post just transpired. He just told me he doesn't want to be with me anymore and also says because I was selfish to do that.....which really freaking gets me hot because HE is the one who gave those things back to ME. I may could even see his side, IF I was the one who said give me everything I've given you back. I didn't. And would never. But I've been working on not letting him get to me and I think this just showed me that he will do anything and say anything to make me be as toxic and negative as him. Either that or he's cheating or trying to replace me by running me away. Iono. I'm upset and confused and a lil hurt by all this."
DeadBedrooms,fer4mcs,t1_fer3nc3,1579349723.0,Ik. Donating it to me meant it was going somewhere somebody may need it or want it. I appreciate your view. Because he hurt my feelings when he put that bag there and said what he said. And I DID walk by it for days before I was like.... Fuck this... It only hurts knowing he knows it's there and he hasn't moved it or apologized.

DeadBedrooms,f1me7kf,t1_f1md3c1,1569591843.0,"He says the guy is a friend of his. They were drinking beers in the kitchen. However this guy I have never met, nor heard if prior. And also what made it weird is that when I came in he introduced me as his boyfriend, but then followed up and said to his FRIEND...Now u have a face with the name. But how the hell does he know about me and I don't know shit about him?"
