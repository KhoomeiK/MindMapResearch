SuicideWatch,fd5atz3,t1_fd4xoi8,1578175832.0,Intellectually I know you’re right. There’s a gnawing part of me that’s hopeful for the future. It keeps gnawing at me. I hate that I’m in this position
SuicideWatch,fd59yfo,t1_fd4y7ja,1578175544.0,All of the above
BPD,fd59wr8,t1_fd511mh,1578175529.0,So many bridges. I have so many regrets
SuicideWatch,fd59tpj,t1_fd51mrv,1578175500.0,"I don’t think nature’s wanting us to kill ourselves. It’s a conscience decision. Because we think we have no other option. I’m open to being wrong, I’m no expert"
SuicideWatch,fd57sj3,t1_fd56plc,1578174999.0,I always think I’m alone. I mean that literally
SuicideWatch,fd55ez0,t1_fd4wao3,1578174342.0,Just know I’m 100% with you. Seriously
SuicideWatch,fd54s76,t1_fd4xoi8,1578174168.0,Idealistically I know I’m worth something. But realistically I know I have ruined lots of opportunities

BPD,fd53o2r,t1_fd511mh,1578173898.0,I burn bridges and I regret it every. Damn. Time. I know better and yet it keeps happening
SuicideWatch,fd3mer6,t1_fd3kjea,1578159758.0,I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I have an innate sense of worthlessness. I can relate to it being a virus
SuicideWatch,fd3f1qy,t1_fd3cliz,1578157672.0,Doesn’t make me a coward. It means I’m uncertain about the outcome. But I obsess about it all the time
SuicideWatch,fd3e9tx,t1_fd3dw85,1578157486.0,"I would say that to others, but not to myself."
BPD,fd3blnh,t3_ejyx5f,1578156672.0,Many people have told me I’m hard to read. I don’t look crazy but I’ve come to realize something isn’t right with me. BPD has ruined my life.
BPD,fcuj9gc,t3_eixxb4,1577982258.0,"Absolutely not. I have been vulnerable before, telling them about BPD, and they don’t understand. Inevitably they will leave. So I’m really good at letting people sort of know me but keeping everything surface level. That’s not the same as taking advantage of them - it’s a defense mechanism. I know that’s not healthy.

But we have to be vulnerable, and have people love us despite flaws. Problem is I haven’t found that. Maybe I will someday."
BPD,fcuipjf,t1_fctz8vb,1577981894.0,"I will check out the link! I’m taking a break now at work and I really didn’t feel like “taking on the day.” I told myself just get to the office, you can’t leave then. I never actively plan on killing myself; I get lost in the fantasy of it. Not wanting to commit the violence of actually dying, just not wanting to exist anymore.

I don’t have much of a support system. I’m glad I found this sub as it’s nice having people validate my experiences. Nowadays it’s rare to have someone actually listen to you; and with BPD, I can say I’ve never felt understood. But I know people here like you and others do, and that really means a lot."
BPD,fcui1r3,t1_fcu2gft,1577981453.0,I’m in the same boat
BPD,fcui01u,t1_fcsrigs,1577981420.0,"Sorry I’m a little late responding.

We’re about the same age and I can relate to a lot you said. I don’t accept that I’ve ruined good things in my life, and believe it’s because I’m a messed up person. Not completely worthless but close.

I’m just trying to make it through the day today. Like you mentioned, that’s a goal that’s worthwhile. Very much appreciate your response!"
BPD,fctlbnl,t3_eiqkwu,1577947520.0,"You’re only 19. It’s good you recognize things like this now. You have a chance to turn things around, and take advantage of opportunities. IMO so many decisions we make have lasting consequences, both big and small decisions. So be wise now and give receptive to the help you’re receiving. 

I don’t feel my best days are yet to come. I want more “best days.” It could happen I guess."
BPD,fctkiah,t1_fcspohf,1577946567.0,"Damn. I needed to hear that, I’m sorry that happened. Suicide is on my mind all the time. Maybe today will be a better day, and all the best to you in 2020"
BPD,fctjjkv,t1_fct6wz6,1577945502.0,"I appreciate that and I hope you’re right. Maybe today will be a better day. I wish it was that easy to forgive myself. I do recognize my triggers but when they come I’m totally overwhelmed. Like Mike Tyson once said, “Everybody’s got a plan until you get hit in the mouth.” I think I have a plan then boom! I’m knocked off my feet and really struggle to get back on solid ground"
BPD,fcsnji8,t1_fcslf3j,1577920442.0,"That takes forgiving yourself for the past, being rational in the present, and allowing yourself the possibility for a future. Right now I struggle with all three.

I’ve ruined so many good things in my life"
BPD,fcskvi4,t1_fcskl74,1577918650.0,Just trying to get through today. And I’ll do the same tomorrow. Thinking about getting through 2020 is overwhelming
BPD,fcqjw64,t3_eig35u,1577887301.0,"I’ve always had plenty of acquaintances. But when I really *talk* to a close friend or girlfriend, they inevitably reject me. “You need to work on you.”

It’s hell for me right now"
BPD,fcnua9e,t1_fcnqq0a,1577818547.0,"That’s true, I’m glad you’ve experienced that. Unfortunately I haven’t. It’s especially needed around the holidays"
BPD,fcntdgw,t1_fcnq8vo,1577818041.0,"I don’t actively compare myself to others, unless I see a happy, younger family at a park. Then it hits me hard. I can definitely relate to your feelings.

I mostly do intense self-loathing"
BPD,fcnodw3,t1_fcno0yl,1577815337.0,It only adds to my innate sense of worthlessness and self-hatred
BPD,fcnma4o,t1_fcnhsw9,1577814190.0,"Appreciate that. I guess I didn’t add the appropriate flair so it was removed, now I know.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I would kill myself if I was certain of what happens after death"
BPD,fcnent6,t3_ei2g0r,1577810157.0,I wish I had some encouragement. All I can say is I can relate 100% and it’s a terrible feeling
BPD,fcmp1af,t3_ei03fp,1577785123.0,"Honestly just hope. 

Hope that new opportunities come my way, and I can make the most of them. Hope in the future, hope I can manage my BPD, hope I’m not as lonely."
BPD,fcmoto3,t3_ehx8cl,1577784821.0,"I love good stories. I’ve had some crazy experiences, travelled a lot, met some great people.

But I can’t tell the grandkids without having kids. I won’t have kids without having a loving wife. And I don’t have a wife because my ex-fiancée rejected me.

Life is about opportunities, even the ones we miss"
BPD,fcl4y5i,t3_ehs2s7,1577739904.0,"I know I need close relationships. Yet I fear close relationships because they see me for me, and they ultimately reject me. So I end up isolated and frustrated.

I can relate to your experience"
BPD,fcl4q9m,t1_fcl1gsn,1577739769.0,You as well. I can relate to your story. I don’t deal well with rejection and loss. It’s hard and I wish I had some more encouraging words for you. Best wishes in the new decade!
BPD,fcl0rp2,t3_ehqmle,1577737317.0,"I’ve told my close friends I have BPD. They didn’t know what it was. They then google it. Reddit it. See all the horror stories and “avoid these people at all costs” posts.

After this, they slowly became just acquaintances. 

It’s a rare thing to have someone love you for you, and to be understood. I miss them and my ex-fiancée every day."
SuicideWatch,fckwgpf,t1_fckuoil,1577734678.0,That has happened before but not for a while now. Unfortunately now i just have acquaintances and work associates. I do appreciate your encouragement though
BPD,fckvj08,t3_ehp3by,1577734101.0,"All I want is to be loved for me. I know I have good qualities, I know I would make a good husband and father. But the rejection inevitably comes. 

Rejection is my #1 trigger and it’s terrible. It absolutely destroys me. I know it’s irrational and yet my emotions are so intense I can’t handle it properly."
SuicideWatch,fckuahe,t1_fcktwoa,1577733337.0,"Who doesn’t fear death though? I think it’s human nature. I want to die because I want relief and an escape. A permanent escape. 

You’re right, though. I do want companionship and to be understood. In the good times and the hard times. That’s a rare thing."
