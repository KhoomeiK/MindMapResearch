loveafterporn,fozibg1,t1_fozdjp0,1588191135.0,"I just want to tell you that you have a wonderful partner. I admire the initiative he took to make you feel comfortable.  

I dated a PA when I was in high school and he was an adult. It was very traumatic and I’m still recovering from it. My current partner was aware of my ex’s  constant cheating and PA and told me he would do whatever he could to make me feel safe. With the porn use, I admit that it didn’t bother me at first (or in denial lol)  and he said he didn’t use it that often but it started bothering me knowing he watched it and he was being less intimate with me and would reject me because his body wasn’t cooperating. My partner used to excessively offer for me to go on his devices but I denied because I find it addictive and my abusive family used to go through my things and I just kinda have a soft spot for it and feel guilty. But I do admit I did snoop once and I found that he was viewing nsfw subs on reddit and that’s when he told me he thought I meant only porn which annoyed me. I was able to look at his reddit because he left it logged on my laptop but after I confronted him and we talked about it, he logged himself out which made me feel insecure because I felt if he wanted me to feel like he really is up to nothing, he would leave it logged on. He said we can look at it together but I don’t feel like I would want to do it together? I think if I were to snoop, I would like to have privacy and then show him what I found that I don’t like. I think it would make me more comfortable.

 As for the group chat, I think it would be reasonable for me to ask if he could leave it out of respect for me. He tells me all the time he would do anything to make me feel secure and he doesn’t want to hurt me. I think it just sucks he doesn’t do it himself without me telling hi not asking him? I can’t be mad without asking him but i feel if he was serious about this, he would eliminate all exposure he could have control of. I don’t understand the bond men have with exchanging nude pictures of women either. I also don’t get comparing sex lives either. He told me that they asked him our frequency and his was the highest and everyone else’s is like 1-3 times a week or less. He told me that he said we were in an argument and told his friends they told my partner to just fuck me. I laughed because I made jokes like that but it felt a bit invasive and embarrassing they think of me like that. He has a ton of group chats with them so if he left this “secret” nsfw one, he would have the other ones still so it wouldn’t be like he’s abandoning them. If they are as good friends as he says they are, they should respect his decision. I just don’t want him to be like, “oh my girlfriend is mad I’m in this group chat and making me leave” and villainize me."
loveafterporn,fozeh56,t1_fozcnhr,1588189300.0,"I have that fear but the entire reason we got his PA addressed what him neglecting me when it came to intimacy and him not being able to have sex with me. He can’t go more than once but very rare occasions he can go more. I would assume that if he was doing it behind my back, he would have a hard time cumming or getting hard and our intimacy would be diminished. He still gives me attention and is a bad liar so I know when I ask him something and things aren’t adding up but luckily he hasn’t lied about this to my knowledge at least. I like to think I’m fair when I when I talk to him about it and friendly when approaching the conversation because I want to be a safe space for honesty and with any addiction, I know there will be relapses. I think the worst thing about this addiction is the lying so I want to kick that in the butt(I’m talking generally not him specifically) But I agree when he was playing dumb that concerned me as well, that is why I often ask him if he has been clean because I don’t want him to be like “oh I thought this didn’t count”. 

Honestly, I dont know how to handle this properly."
TwoXSex,fozac94,t1_foynj02,1588187328.0,"I feel like not all situations are that one partner is anti porn in the beginning. I always had my past partners watch porn and talk about porn it but it never bothered me because they still gave me attention. We would even send each other videos of what we like to help communicate what we wanted, etc. I consume porn myself but never let it get in the way of having intimacy with my partner and never choose porn over my partner. When your partner rejects your sexual initiatives and then you wake up to them watching porn and masturbating, that is when it becomes a problem. Everyone is different and I don’t hate porn, I just don’t think some people can handle or balance the consumption without getting desensitized to real encounters."
loveafterporn,foz7enl,t1_foz67t1,1588185929.0,"He knew already. When I did my verbal check in he said that it auto saves and that’s why he had the pictures still saved and assured me he didn’t manually save them. I think I’m just bummed out he didn’t delete them right away? I don’t want to look for a reason to be mad because he is doing a great job but I feel like this kind of carelessness could lead to something. I was clear in the past about not having saved images. One time when I did find out he was still looking at nsfw, he said he thought I meant only porn and not lewds which felt like he was trying to not be held accountable."
TwoXSex,foyuc11,t3_ga305p,1588179318.0,"I had the same issue with my parter. I honestly didn’t think porn addiction was a real thing or that it would have to be “really bad” to be an addiction (ignorant I know). My partner had to use viagra but thought it was just because he was getting older. His porn use didn’t bother me at first but as our intimacy started to diminish, I started to get more insecure when I would come across the porn he used or him looking at lewds because it felt like he was rejecting me. I have a high sex drive and I love sending nudes so it wasn’t like I made him resort to watching porn. 

He’s been porn free for about 4-5 months and he told me that he doesn’t feel desensitized to visuals anymore and sex feels so much more different and he thanked me for it. He didn’t realize how porn impacted him. Our frequency is everyday now and he shows way more interest to me and it doesn’t feel like he uses my body to masturbate. 

I really liked /loveafterporn sub because I feel like talking about having a partner with a porn addiction isn’t a conversation I want to have with just anyone because people can be quite cruel and blame you for it."

He used viagra to cope with this but was unaware his porn use was causing this. Once we moved in together I requested that he stop using porn because it felt unfair that it was pretty much a missed opportunity for us to be intimate if he was going to just masturbate. He had a couple slip ups where he was still looking but I can confidently say he stopped. He is able to get hard on command, shows more interest in me, and he even told me that sex feels different now that he doesn’t use porn anymore. He said it’s easier to feel excited by me and he doesn’t feel desensitized anymore."
LifeAfterNarcissism,flxu4zd,t3_frf7xl,1585589875.0,"My mom would always say she could just leave and live her best life on her own with her boyfriend, but she wouldn’t so we can have our mom. She always prided herself for staying even though we were “holding her back” from her living her best life. She said she didn’t have to do shit for us but since she is a good mom she will pay the bills, feed us, and work 

It hurt on its own but she was absent for 4 1/2 years because she went to prison when I was in elementary school. She constantly would remind us she could leave."
survivinginfidelity,flkl1re,t3_fp8yhi,1585242920.0,"When you said all she could say was “I’m sorry” or “I don’t know” those are the same exact responses my serial cheater ex’s would give me when I confronted them the first time. 

Also, saying she only slept with him one time doesn’t mean anything. One time or one hundred times, it’s not okay. I hate that cheaters always try to downplay things saying “it was only once” or “it didn’t mean anything”. It’s so frustrating. I’m so sorry you are going through this."
cheating_stories,fleigpg,t3_fo70nu,1585085018.0,"I’m so sorry this is happing to you. I dated a serial cheater and dealt with a lot of manipulation. It was so hard to leave. I was with him for 3 years. I was 15 and he was 20 when we met. I didn’t know about his infidelity until a year later. I also have a narcissistic family and he was my temporary escape which made it harder for me to want to leave. I was very excited emotionally invested by that time so it was easy to tell myself that it was a mistake. I also found out the first time he cheated way later when it actually happened so that made it “easier” to “forget” but he still remained the same. The last year,  I thought I was at the point where I was able to forgive him and let go of all his “mistakes” but deep inside I was looking for a sign to leave, then I found out he was sexting this girl. It hurt me the most because he never asked me for nudes and I would constantly offer to send him nudes but he would deny my offers. He was a porn addict as well and would lie about his usage. His reasoning for sexting her was because he didn’t want to treat me like an object lol? But I am so thankful I found those messages, I was hurt at first but later that night I realized this isn’t what I wanted and that I don’t love him. I remember that sudden joy I felt strangely after crying at work for hours. I didn’t leave him right away, I distanced myself from him and said we would take a break because he didn’t take no for an answer. It was crazy because it was him harassing me and not leaving me alone til I said we could reconsider things with time and he then said “I knew you would say that” and he left me alone. I know its mean to lie but it was what I had to do. He still contacts me to this day after two years of our breakup hoping to get another chance. I am so grateful I saw those messages even though it killed me reading their conversation. It brought me peace and made me feel less crazy realizing he will never change. I would honestly still be with him probably if I didn’t see those messages. 

I know your situation is different but I hope you get the strength and opportunity to leave. I didn’t feel like the relationship impacted me but it left me a lot of emotional scars that I projected on the people I would see after I left him."
survivinginfidelity,fl1izvm,t3_fll3tn,1584729950.0,"Kitten. It used to be a pet name my ex used for me. I found out he called one of the girls he cheated on me a lot that as well. Him lying and hiding already hurt but the lack exclusivity of our intimacy hurt much more. It was just a pet name for me but she was very into pet play. They would role play her as a kitten and etc. When I found out and read their messages, I requested him to never call me that again. I was able to finally leave after 2 1/2 years and it’s been about two years unce I left.

I feel I sound silly for saying this but I became self aware of me still not liking the word recently. Hearing it still stings. My partner and I recently got a kitten and when I hear him talk about how much he loves it and how cute it is, I feel discomfort. But I only feel this when he refers it as “kitten”. I’m not actually jealous about the cat lol, it was my idea. There was also this one time when we was taking about how cute it was, he also asked me if I was his kitten and that felt really ugly for me"

loveafterporn,fkfkf7z,t3_fhy2it,1584136375.0,"We didn’t realize it was an addiction until he stopped watching porn. I normally was okay with SOME past partners when it came to porn consumption because certain relationships I had, their porn consumption didn’t impact our intimacy. 

When I started dating my current partner, he was not able to get hard or stay hard. He used to use Viagra to “battle” this. This was territory I have personally never experienced and it was something he said he believed was coming due to his age. When we moved in together it made me a little uncomfortable to know he could be using porn because we have all our free time together. So if he is going to beat it, why not use it for an opportunity to have sex with me instead of using porn. He was very supportive when I asked him to stop the first time. I did find him on using lewd subs on here and told him I didn’t want that either and thought I communicated that, he said I wasn’t specific but whatever lol. 

Anyways, it’s been like 2-3 months now and we are able to have sex two times a day now and sometimes more. He one day thanked me for getting him off porn because he realized it desensitized physically and visually. He said sex feels different (in a good way) after not using porn for so long and he also realized how it robs being intimate with your significant other."

It left a lot of invisible wounds I didn’t know that I had that I would project on partners I had later. But I am healing now and I have a great partner that I appreciate so much. I used to hate Reddit and the idea of Reddit used to make me feel so much rage and fear because it is what he used to find the people he cheated on me with and it was where he consumed most of his porn. But I feel lucky to have found communities like this that help validate my feelings and not make me feel alone or crazy.

AskWomen,fk59ffj,t1_fk58q39,1583876047.0,I realized I didn’t put how I healed. I finally moved out with my partner four months ago and I am still healing. He has been such a great support system. I got a new job with an amazing boss. We both had very emotionally abusive mothers and are able to connect that way. She is such a great person even though she has been through so much and it inspires me to not let my trauma jade me and that it’s possible to not bring everyone else down with you. It’s almost like she is the mom I never had. It feels like fate that I met her. I didn’t realize the lack of boundaries I had with my family but he is currently my support system. I wouldn’t know where I would be if he didn’t get me out of there.
AskWomen,fk58q39,t3_fgfngx,1583875655.0,"When my partner and I started dating, I would spend my days off at his house. There was one point where I ended up having a week off so I brought a ton of clothes and my dog, it felt almost like a vacation! I remember on the drive home I realized I had this tight feeling in my throat and I felt afraid. I started to cry and my partner asked me what was wrong. I didn’t know what was wrong at first but then I realized that I didn’t want to go home. Not like oh, I am so sad to leave my boyfriend I’m going to miss him but I felt like feeling safe and distracted was over to an end. It then hit me on how much stress that my family and especially my mother gave me. He pulled over and we talked about it and it felt like I was able to see everything on how it actually is. It was so strange how in that moment I was able to identify how toxic and emotionally manipulative my mother was. Several months ago my mom confessed to selling drugs again (she got locked up for 5 years and when I was in kindergarten for the same thing) I have a 1, 2 yo brothers and a 9 yo little sister so it hurt she put them at risk for what I had to go through. She admitted to doing it for a year and said it was all my fault because she can’t depend on me for shit. My brother and I supported her financially and with whatever she needed so this was even more heart breaking. I didn’t realize how unfair and ridiculous it was that she blamed me for her actions. I was carrying that weight for me for so long and had so much self hatred. I realized that it wasn’t fair to blame me. I did everything I could. Also, going out for a long time repeatedly freaked me out because my family would give me crap but they gave me crap regardless if I stayed in or went out. But this was the first time I didn’t have that inner voice of my mother being upset and not feeling like I had to constantly worry about them judging me. It felt like that terrible feeling when you repress something shitty but then you remember and it’s just a bad time again, so all that unused worry comes full force. 

I had a similar experience when I was in 6th grade and I was in a homeless shelter. It was the day I was going to be sent back home but I had the same tight feeling in my throat and felt scared. I didn’t know what I was afraid of. I kept complaining of feeling nausea and feeling off. I started crying uncontrollably not knowing why I was afraid. I didn’t consciously think that me going home was scary, I knew it was going to happen and I couldn’t change the outcome so why be afraid. Since it was my day to go home, my mom picked me up instead of the caretaker. The tightness still followed me through the rest of the day. I was watching a movie with my stepdad and mom, we ended up cuddling and I started to vomit due to stress. The fear that I had as an adult reminded me this this moment and made me realize that I had to get out."

Once we finished building my pc it did turn on just fine but we had to mess with it because the rgb wasn’t working on my fans or cpu cooler and I was very disappointed because it was the entire reason why I updated my build lol so I couldn’t settle with just letting it be. 

My boyfriend was moving my computer back and fourth from the carpet and to the desk we were working on and I believe it got short circuited from him tampering with it while it was sitting on the carpet and while I was sitting on my chair and messing with it. But at first it made a weird smell and I admit it did scare me and I refused to turn it on until we make sure everything is in correctly. Then a couple more times of us turning it on and off again to see if we got the rgb to work, it just stopped turning on completely. I thought we may have had not plugged something correctly. We didn’t know what exactly happened at the time and did a lot of trouble shooting. We tried using his power supply because his is obviously working but my computer didn’t turn on. Then we tried changing all the psu cables just to see and it turns out that all my psu cables got damaged as well. We knew for sure because we tried using them on his computer and it wouldn’t work. We tried so many combinations of things and I’m glad we didn’t give up. 

I literally tried everything that is recommended when your pc doesn’t post or turn on and was able to try everything on all the lists suggesting cpu, gpu, ram, motherboard, re-plugging everything back together, and basically everything I could find because I was changing everything. Out of all the videos I watched, no one recommends to check the psu cables lol."

BPD,fiuff4b,t3_f9llcb,1582740367.0,For me I think it’s the validation of my idea. My partner and I got in an argument about putting something in the passenger seat instead of the backseat. I just told him to put it in the passenger seat but then he sighed and ROLLED HIS EYES. I don’t know but that really sets me off when he rolls his eyes and it feels very disrespectful. It just feels very unfair because I have to always bite my tongue and try extra hard to not be an asshole but he can’t take the time to show signs of disrespect knowing I’m very reactive. I was explaining to him why it was better but it felt like he was annoyed with me when I was trying to explain my viewpoint on it rather than actually listening to me. He proceeded to roll his eyes and he higher’s his voice when he thinks someone his stupid and doesn’t want to listen to them anymore which makes me feel even more invalidated. I called him out on it and he claims he doesn’t realize he does it which I find so unfair. He is a terrible liar as well. I notice it helps me not get pissed of when he acknowledges what I’m trying to say and validates my opinion and not accidentally belittle me. I sucks feeling like I can’t have a constructive argument argument without feeling like I need to be told I’m right to not feel like people think I’m stupid. Or maybe that’s just me.
TwoXSex,fir4865,t3_f98bq9,1582657045.0,"Ok so I had the same issue and I did confront my partner. However, its very frustrating because it feels like I’m not important enough for him to consistently try. I am a very giving person and I always communicate with what I want and always ask what he wants. My partner is a great listener but his consistency fades. It doesn’t feel so great feeling like I need to harp on him to “put effort” and character into our intimacy. 

When it came to asking him, I would ask him during sex/foreplay because I feel like when you’re both in that “mood” it’s easier to just do what you’re told without asking why, or that’s at least how it is for us lol. Then after sex/foreplay I will comment how much better that made me feel when we changed it up. I try to avoid to tell my partner what he could have done better right after sex because I find that can make him feel bad about his performance. I understand you’re wanting to be sensitive to your partner’s feelings but I do feel they shouldn’t take it to heart because sex requires communication. I don’t know if you watch porn together or watch it in general but one thing I have done with other partners is find a video of what I like and show them that’s how I want a certain thing done. Or you can masturbate next to him and show him. I find when I do this, it’s easy for me to express the things I want to be done and fantasize what he could be doing and communicate it. I don’t really have a filter when I am aroused and find it easier to say what I want."
Twitch,fhc1a18,t3_f21nvh,1581454187.0,"From my personal experience, I find certain games bring certain viewers(wholesome or toxic). Some games are just easier to interact with chat either by playing with them or just being able to pay attention to chat itself. 

Also with playing either only one or the same couple games, it’s easier to have things to talk about with familiar chatters. So when I find a game that I can constantly play that doesn’t always bring toxic raids (I understand this is inevitable but it’s my personal experience) I play comfortably while interacting with chat, making the vibe more cozy for me. It’s kinda like muscle memory with the said game and I don’t find myself having to pay too much attention to it since I’m playing it all the time."

Once I got a response I would have my partner/friend read the response and then I will ask them to tell me good or bad (or just nothing). I still feel shitty but there is something about someone else doing it for me that feels less gutting.

When it comes to texting people, I’ll send the text when I am in a middle of a game, cleaning, or just something distracting. I try to find something time consuming because it usually gives people enough time to answer but if they don’t, I will feel a little better about myself because I either finished a chore, made progress in a game, or just did something. 

This may not be good advice I’m sorry but this works for me. It probably doesn’t help your exact situation either since it sounds a bit more time sensitive🥺"
TwoXSex,fgmsuh7,t3_ezais4,1580931354.0,"The times I have squirted always have been by accident and caught me by surprise. I have never successfully squirted when I made the personal goal to squirt. I have squirted during penetrative sex, hands and just a toy. I still have yet to figure out what exactly made me squirt lol."
relationship_advice,ff9tmax,t3_esgk5z,1579720996.0,She could have been sexting someone else or she could be venting to a friend. I normally vent to my girlfriends when I feel rejected by my partner or just need validation.

buildapc,feaaj9q,t1_fea6wi1,1578946304.0,It has only three holes. Not four. I understand what you are saying. So I can’t do anything since it has three holes
buildapc,fea3703,t1_fea2752,1578943897.0,"I am using the left one. If you mean making sure they’re facing the correct side, I thought this connector is fool proof when it comes to connecting to headers because I can’t flip it due to how the pins are laid out"
buildapc,fea09vi,t1_fe9ritr,1578943068.0,I see one three pin connector but that is for the power and it goes on the aio pump header. The other connector has two connectors one being for msi/asus/asrock and the other being a gigabyte connector. I have an asus so I plug that argb 3 pin connector into the motherboard that is a 3 pin header. The only other headers I have are rgb but they are 12v. The connector on the cpu cooler is 5v
