HollowKnight,fq8n227,t1_fq8n05p,1589170124.0,it'll be worth it when you finally get it truly an amazing game
HollowKnight,fq8mwre,t1_fq8mtn3,1589170017.0,It certainly is and I hope silksong has a mode similar so I can re experience it also why cant you play HK?
HollowKnight,fq8mobm,t1_fq8mj5k,1589169846.0,Took me like 9 or 10 attempts on the 5th pantheon after a whole lot of practice in the hall of gods. Not going to lie my hands were shaking so much which is something I have never had a game make me do before even 15 mins after I finished it
HollowKnight,fpn427s,t1_fpn3zti,1588749544.0,Im going to do that after beating the pantheon found out theres still more endings to be found
TowerofGod,fo7pkk7,t1_fo7p3pq,1587582344.0,at the moment it definitely is so much people I know that struggled to get through the early stages of TOG are loving it now and the info they skipped they can easily bring up later its small necessary changes also black march is more detailed in the anime and looks nicer but thats subjective. In any case a design change does not equate to a bad change thats my entire point different does not equal bad
TowerofGod,fo7nns0,t1_fo7nk5g,1587581428.0,during the part with hatz yes but shinsoo on the other hands looks bloody amazing
TowerofGod,fo7nawd,t1_fo7myxc,1587581258.0,yeah those are definitely reasonable concerns but im mostly talking about people who see those differences and automatically think the entire anime is garbage because of it agree with rak being less charismatic though.
TowerofGod,fo7mobl,t1_fo7mkh9,1587580951.0,Yeah thats true im mainly talking to the people that think any slight change makes the adaptation garbage
TowerofGod,fo7lqdw,t1_fo7juq4,1587580484.0,such inconsequential info dumps were part of the reason why many people struggled to get into tower of gods webtoon at first. The very same people that I have reccomended tower of god that dropped it are loving the anime I think many webtoon readers are treating the word different as a synonym for bad they will definitely mention urek and enryu later
bleach,fmcsuhf,t1_fmcrces,1585952151.0,makes sense
bleach,fmcitt0,t1_fmcfs2n,1585946500.0,Yes they never do an incantation they just straight up go into wrapping kido around their body so I was a bit confused lol
bleach,fm9hwb5,t1_fm7hfqc,1585869075.0,You know studio pierrot animated bleach before right
loseit,fjb27nk,t3_fc9wxj,1583185051.0,"Why have I seen so much people recently in real life deny CICO and say it doesnt work while at the same time recommending specific diets do these people fail to realize that every single diet in the world is CICO? Usually I see people say that CICO isn't the only thing that matters as eating healthy nutritional food matters more but again eating ""healthy foods"" usually results in a caloric deficit... due to fruits and vegetables being low cal. How can I get people to take CICO serious in my life and stop living in delusion"
SuicideWatch,fdilm25,t1_fdg23l1,1578445642.0,a bit better but its kinda scary knowing the only reason Im alive is cuz of not having access to things that could kill me imagine my circumstances were different
Energy_manipulation,f76cpoi,t1_f71e45l,1573426477.0,I do not think we are able to see it as far as I know all we can do is feel and manipulate it to our will but not see it.
SuicideWatch,f5o9t6b,t1_f5o77ww,1572313102.0,I was on a few but didnt do any good benzos is looking like my only option right now but I dont want to get addicted.
SuicideWatch,f5o1nzq,t1_f5ngvey,1572308060.0,Ah I see thats understandable its hard to keep trying when things go to shit. I have very bad social anxiety and I was extremely hopeful after trying to seek treatment but nothing is really working and its frustrating when after trying so long to hide it and finally gaining the courage to seek help nothing changes. I'm tired of the continuous effort that leads to nowhere
StardustCrusaders,f5o1gi2,t1_f5nhsa0,1572307926.0,I think they are trying to say that since her hair is her stand and normal people cant see stands she appears bald to others but I dont think thats the case cuz of certain part 3 stands
SuicideWatch,f5ncz54,t1_f5jvz9w,1572298901.0,Wow thats actually quite the coincidence feels weird and hypocritical for someone like me to give advice since I'm thinking of ending my life. However I can say for sure that being that old and still going to school is nothing to be ashamed of. My older brother finished at 35 and I actually consider him mentally stronger for being that old and not giving him up hope all goes well.
anime,f5isgqr,t1_f5irpqw,1572217652.0,If you havent watched either of them then you havent gathered enough information about them
anime,f5ijhfh,t1_f5igjrx,1572215098.0,I know but you shouldnt compare if you didnt watch one piece
anime,f5ijf49,t1_f5ij5jr,1572215074.0,I agree but thats not the point lol
SuicideWatch,f5bo57s,t1_f5b8jr1,1572123834.0,How do you know this?
MarioKartTour,f4xg1rz,t1_f4wnrby,1571865240.0,True I'm just talking about reusing all the old tracks especially early on instead of letting us play all the new ones right off the bat like the previous tours
MarioKartTour,f4dakib,t3_d96y8e,1571540025.0,721479569334 add me cuz I need 3 friends challenge
AhiruNoSora,f2yzriv,t1_f2y0vsl,1570502469.0,Theres actually around 600 chapters of ahiru no sora raw you can only find raw chapters in the 500s to 600s though. I'm sure the japanese animation studio thats animating this will have an easier time adapting it since ahiru no sora is big in japan.
AhiruNoSora,f2xjhvc,t1_f2xiooy,1570479093.0,Super dissapointing atleast we have the anime and they could just adapt from the raw scans since they dont need translations
SuicideWatch,ezxbk8z,t1_ezwy7la,1568236474.0,"If god exists and hes omnipresent then whenever something absolutely horrific happens like a little girl getting raped god is literally right beside her watching not doing a thing despite being all powerful and merciful because of free will. If god exists hes a cunt,"
Energy_manipulation,ezly09d,t1_ezl9uxb,1567983309.0,I guess your right its just I want to know for sure that its not something else. I've had certain experiences in which I try to feel ki energy and do something physically taxing that becomes easier after using energy but it could also be a placebo.
Energy_manipulation,ezgmir0,t1_ezgcu2c,1567898672.0,Thing is I can literally make certain parts of my body hotter if I just imagine the energy going to that area and have yet to find an answer so I guess at this point science just isnt there yet
stevenuniverse,eyuo2l7,t3_cywufq,1567467441.0,This movie was amazing cant wait till all the songs come out and hopefully we see more of spinel in season 6 she was a great character.
SuicideWatch,eyfvmz4,t3_cwpqz4,1567055962.0,Sometimes the simplest things that dont seem to matter as much actually have the most impact on our lives glad that you got the extra push you needed to keep trucking on.
SuicideWatch,ey93gzt,t1_ey915jm,1566934394.0,Thanks lol but I'm not really strong since I spend a lot of time feeling sorry for myself.
SuicideWatch,ey90udl,t1_ey8zxh7,1566932700.0,I can definitely see where they are coming from they are just not aware enough about mental illness. Also currently no I'm going to university but eventually I do plan on it when I'm finished up with school.
SuicideWatch,ey8zof5,t1_ey8yy9a,1566931948.0,"Yes and it didnt work out so well my family does not believe in mental illness and are very religous. All advice that was given to me was ""pray to god"" and ""It's all in your head"""
SuicideWatch,ey5vcc3,t1_ey5mzyp,1566841190.0,No and thats the worst part
SuicideWatch,ey1uoy5,t1_ey1uf6g,1566711992.0,They definitely wont suffer for only 6-8 weeks
socialanxiety,ewdk156,t1_ewaesr9,1565302087.0,So would you say that I should go out and just talk to strangers as a good start? How long should I do this or should I do something else
socialanxiety,ew9t8lg,t1_ew99z4u,1565230773.0,I probably wont turn to medication for now but if I do I'll definitely try clonazolam out thanks
socialanxiety,ew9t0ez,t1_ew9ps7d,1565230670.0,Thanks a bunch will definitely check it out
socialanxiety,ew8l4sj,t1_ew8j0v8,1565211272.0,I would like to go to therapy but I can't which is why I'm looking for other ways.
