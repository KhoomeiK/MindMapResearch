And there was some woman who put her youthful photo of herself on her carnivore-promoting book but failed to tell readers that it was taken back when she was a vegetarian. Now she looks terrible. Really shocking.

There was another woman who wrote a low carb diet book I bought back in 2010. I saw her recently and... holy hell.

I’m sure not everyone would look terrible. It’s all quite subjective. But these people genuinely shocked me."

ArchitecturalRevival,fnvjj8f,t3_g3p2h3,1587295662.0,"Nah. It would be a lot better if we pulled it down and replaced it with a giant concrete brutalist box with large amounts of superfluous steel and glass. It will be waaaay over budget and behind schedule. It will receive countless awards from the architecture community of people who live nowhere near it. And the local community will despise it, but made to feel like fools for not praising it like the oh-so-smart architects do.

Then it could accumulate cracks and damp and mould. After countless expensive repairs on problems that should not exist in the first place, ultimately it will be abandoned. Then it could gradually become covered in graffiti until some homeless people can sh1t in it and shoot up heroin and litter drug paraphernalia all around it.

Then the local council could throw up a metal fence around it to stop the crime, allowing weeds to grow out of control within it.

Finally, at great expense to the local taxpayers, this too can finally be demolished and make way for a new development.

The architecture community will mourn its passing. “Oh if only these common people could be as enlightened as us.”"

They’ve done more damage to the vegan movement than anything else. There’s plenty of them here on Reddit and Facebook and they’re the reason why the vegan community has such a (deserved) toxic reputation.

They’ve turned off many people from going vegan and have therefore caused more animals to die.

They’re also really two-faced because they claim to be compassionate and caring but they have no interest in the welfare of humans, such as the poor. They’re especially aggressive towards other vegans. Many of them appear to be narcissists or to have some other kind of personality disorder."

I hope it’s not introduced into the game as sometimes it can be unrealistic. After all, some real-life rides never lose their popularity over time. Disney would have to pull down Space Mountain as it’s “old”, but instead it’s refurbished occasionally and is now more popular than ever.

Perhaps it would be realistic addition to Parkitect if a ride with a low scenery rating could lose popularity as it gets old (such as a simple coaster with no theming), but a ride with a high scenery rating (at Disney levels of detail) could become a “classic” that never loses popularity.

That would make sense to me and add an interesting challenge to the game, pushing the player to pursue quality in their designs over time."
