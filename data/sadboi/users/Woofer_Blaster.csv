socialskills,fju0ony,t3_ferdri,1583612543.0,"I learned this a long time ago and it honestly helps my anxiety so much, i learned to just embrace how weird i am, and my imperfections, like how i stutter, or my eyes twitch ocasionally or how my hair doesnt look perfect, or how im a little skinnier than average, if you have alot of people shit talking you and putting you down dont let it get to you, their ""opinions"" arent the opinions most ppl have and they likely are just jealous (as stupid as that might sound for some of you like me).
