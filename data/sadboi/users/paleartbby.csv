BPD,fqcx7i9,t3_ghw4yq,1589272031.0,i relate for sure. i feel like i sabotage myself of any progress out of fear that i won't do it perfectly and make mistakes. it's really messed with a lot of shit in my life and kept me from doing so much.
BPD,fqcwyni,t3_ghqcxp,1589271784.0,"I consistently feel like I put more effort into all relationships I have than anyone else ever does for me. it's a huge let down, and i tend to find myself being hopeful everytime a new relationship forms, but i'm always disappointed. it's this annoying reoccurring cycle and i hate it.  i feel like i set my goals too high, but i also feel like a lot of people literally just show no effort to make me feel better in any way or to make me feel special unless prompted and even then it seems like nothing."
BPD,fno0p9w,t1_fngmqy6,1587107871.0,thank you for your response. my brain is basically in a continuous tailspin rn and i appreciate the kindness as well as the honesty.
BPD,fn7s0nz,t1_fn7d07w,1586726459.0,"thank you for your response. i appreciate all of the input and recommendations, i honestly didn‚Äôt know there were so many options until this thread! 

thank you for the support‚Äî i wish you good luck as well in your mental health journey! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
BPD,fn7ru3l,t1_fn7iom1,1586726358.0,this is the one i heard about before all others and what ultimately made me want to speak with my psych about mood stabilizers and such! definitely a medication i‚Äôd like to try out and see if it‚Äôs the right fit. thanks for the input i really appreciate it!!
BPD,fn7rifj,t1_fn7h1ef,1586726169.0,"i‚Äôm on the 300 mg of this right now, just got bumped up after being on 150 for about a month. coworkers and loved ones so far have told me i seem like ‚Äúmyself x2.‚Äù i have noticed that i‚Äôve been a bit more energetic, but it almost seems like a near permanent state of mania was with depressive episodes peaking through. i‚Äôd say so far it‚Äôs the best i‚Äôve felt on an anti-depressant for sure, but my anger/irritability and intense mood swings still persist which gets in the way of a lot of my daily activities and my relationships. thank you for responding!"
BPD,ff7pm6i,t3_es4b8r,1579655272.0,i‚Äôve done this honestly for as long as i can remember and have lowkey always been afraid to admit it. i‚Äôm glad someone can relate to this omg.
BPD,f32diqx,t3_df9f8x,1570603621.0,"completely different story for me, but a similar situation. i‚Äôm curious as to how others cope on this. i‚Äôm seeing an impending end."
BPD,evuh3cn,t1_ev9k5oq,1564795095.0,"the protection from not being remembered is so relatable. it isn't the case with some of the ones i'm dealing with today per se, but i've definitely felt that in the past. i've never felt like a memorable person in the slightest so that would make a lot of sense! i'm glad i'm not alone, but i'm sorry you deal with these feelings as well."
BPD,evugwyl,t1_evas6wl,1564794950.0,"late response but, i'm sorry that you're going through this as well. it's really shitty feeling and hard to grasp. i desperately want to feel close with these people that i used to feel so attached to but i'm still struggling to find a way."
BPD,evugu6f,t1_ev9uzvf,1564794889.0,i'll have to look into it-- thanks for the reply and info!
BPD,ev8wvcy,t1_ev8rvpk,1564294873.0,well it‚Äôs nice to know i‚Äôm not alone. it‚Äôs the worst trying to deal with. it makes me feel so far away from people. thank you for responding and relating!
birthcontrol,eu20o1x,t3_cedv1c,1563379736.0,i‚Äôm honestly curious myself. had mine inserted two days ago and have been having quite a lot of cramping that doesn‚Äôt really go away w/ anything. i went to work for a few hours yesterday but had a difficult time as my job involves lifting things and physical labor.
BPD,etnr0wz,t3_ccemzx,1562996827.0,"i've done a few things that have gotten me into trouble,  like coke and ritalin, which make me feel really energized and the most awake i've felt in a very long time, but also create a problem with me and my addictive personality-- but i'm doing a lot better there. otherwise, i've done mdma 2-3 times and really enjoyed it. as you said, it really relieves my anxiety when it comes to socializing especially. i feel like the better, more comfortable version of myself-- which i sort of feel sad and ashamed to say. i've used hallucinogens a few times-- acid was looong, and somewhat made me feel antsy, but was a decent time. it only got bad at the end when it didn't wear off before i had to go in to work the next day (i was stupid and thought i wouldn't still be feeling it by then). shrooms gave me the worst experience-- havent done them since i had a huge ass breakdown at my friend's house with full body sobbing, demonizing my best friend in my brain to the point where i seriously questioned our friendship, and wanting to die the entire time. it really fucked me up for a while afterwards even. not the best experience."
BPDmemes,epevhyr,t3_bumozg,1559187594.0,yeah my smol old lady therapist would probably shit herself if i was completely honest with her about everything i think and do ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
