My first onebag was a  way-overengineered MEC briefcase-style pack that carries half the capacity of the Timbuktu for more weight. I realized that I  don't give my bags that much of a workout.

I did mod a Deuter top-loading pack for wilderness backpacking by removing the lid and adding a silnylon extension sleeve with a drawstring and a strap/clip to fold it over. Also removed a compartment wall at the bottom of the pack and shortened extra strap length. This gives me a HUGE capacity for the weight.
