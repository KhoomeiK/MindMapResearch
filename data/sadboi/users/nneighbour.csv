the drinks.  The only ones mentioned as containing concerning ingredients that are big names today are Coke and 7-UP. 

Looks like some of the modern drinks we have were designed for their medicinal properties. Root beer (sarsaparilla for syphilis), tonic (quinine for malaria), ginger ale (ginger for nausea). Funny to see that ginger ale is the only soft drink that’s kept the status as something you give to sick people.
