1) trans people aren't a homogeneous group by a long shot. Surgery will help some, not others.

2) you jump straight to surgery. Many transfolk neither get nor want surgery, they just want to present their gender 

3) you are defending the fee-fees of people who are upset by transfolk. Those people need to get they asses into at least the last century. Gender is and always has been performative (ex: pink used to be for boys, bc it was like red, which is tough! Not like soft blue, for soft girls).

Third , aspergers isnt a mental illness, it's a sensory input disorder. BIG difference. Illness means something is going wrong with the brain, disorder means something is just different at the genetic level and can be sort of mediated, but meds are usually only for comorbid conditions (like with ASD, anxiety and depression are often, but not always, comorbid. (In before ""aspergers isnt a thing, the DSM blah blah"" a lot of people who were initially labeled with it identify with the name/find it a useful descriptive distinction between themselves and people at the non-verbal end of the spectrum, it's their disorder, they can call it what they like. )

Like mostly rust, multiple holes in the floor, the passenger door stopped opening for a while so I had to jump in the window racecar driver style (which I thought was dope AF)...but eventually, mom put her foot down (thankfully, not inside the car) and said he wasn't allowed to drive me in it anymore...I think eventually she paid someone to tow it away bc he downright refused to recognize it as dangerous. (the exhaust falling off was the final straw for her.)"

howto,fqdyi1v,t3_ghwygd,1589298785.0,"Has she ever said something about suicide to you?  You could ask her what she means by that. Suicide has such a weird space in pop culture...I had an autistic student who used to say he should just commit suicide/he wished he was dead for every small mistake or minor mistreatment by classmates...10 minutes later he was fine. Of course I reported it every single time , but just knowing this kid and his problems expressing his emotions,  I'm relatively sure he didn't really mean he was suicidal. To him, those phrases meant something more like ""I'm extremely frustrated"", ""that really hurt my feelings"" etc. 
He figured out I reported what he said to the counselor and asked me why I did it. I told him that my job required me to do so, even if the kid is ""joking"", and told him it made me scared, too, because I liked him and would be really sad if something bad happened to him. He sort of rolled his eyes in a little kid way and insisted he didn't *mean"" it.

TL, DR, check with her about what she means when she says shes suicidal. You could get a better perspective on specific things that are bothering her. 
And naturally,  tell her mom she said it. Really cant be too careful."

Every time I've read about it, though, it was because new mom had a seizure disorder and couldn't take her meds/hadn't been back on them long enough for them to work,  was incredibly sleep deprived and had a blackout seizure where she did normal stuff totally unaware of it...but didnt recognize that was a baby she was putting in the microwave bc you know, blackout seizure. Really sad all around."
