The OPs intentions are all good but also kind of damaging because not everyone with a mental illness could be capable of recognising that they do need help, or that there is something wrong, or that they should be taking precautions. 

There’s high functioning people with mental illnesses who
can do those things but that’s by far not everyone."

You are literally adding to
The stigma that prevents people from getting help. 

You have been the victim of ONE, you don’t know everyone suffering the disorder. If I said I was attacked by someone in a manic state and therefore everyone with bipolar is aggressive and dangerous you would disagree right? And even think that that is fucked up and damaging to say? Because it is, and people used to do the exact same thing with many mental illnesses which is now (mostly) frowned on but you (and others) want to keep
It going for BPD and THAT is toxic.
