I suppose on my end, he seems like someone who displays these red flags very outwardly, and that can be worrying. But, just as being high can raise your anxiety, it can make you a lot more cool to say things that are on your mind. So it could also be his high affecting his actions just as much as your high affecting your reaction. I think the biggest question in the story for me was you turning around to see him with a large branch along with his reaction. To me, the rest of story and how you describe him is worrying, but I can’t say I haven’t had people of a similar mindset in my life. But that branch part definitely weirds me out, even without the rest of the story."
Thetruthishere,fq91dvn,t3_ghi5to,1589182150.0,"I definitely can’t say if he had true intentions to harm you, but he definitely sounds like he wants you to think he is going to at the very least. He sounds like he needs a lot of mental help. From what you’ve explained, he shows red flags of being capable of harming someone, and there could be other red flags that you don’t see yourself. Again, I can’t give a definite answer on if he wanted to harm you, but in general, if someone makes you feel unsafe when you are around them, that can be a major problem in a friendship, and it seems like a problem that can only be solved if he seeks help."

abuse,fnys7ek,t3_g4icxk,1587373681.0,"That’s mental abuse leading to physical abuse. He is trying to make you afraid of him so you don’t leave him, while also making you think that he could just find someone new to make you feel like you are less than him. You’re smarter than that, I can see that from how you explained the situation. The number one thing to do is to get out of there, because the situation seems to be escalating very quickly. What you should also do is explain the situation to close friends that you can trust. It’s very normal to have second thoughts when leaving someone who is mentally abusive, that’s their goal. Having someone there to tell you that it’s a bad idea can be very helpful, especially if it’s someone who’s opinion you trust. Stay safe 💕"
