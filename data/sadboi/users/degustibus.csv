I just checked and there is some price gouging going on with panicky Corona buying (I got temp scanned to get into a furniture store today).  Check Harbor Freight or Amazon.  With this too you can quickly figure out what is going on in your hot room.  You scan the wall around the window and compare the temp readings to another wall to rule out a builder mistake like little/no insulation.  It will also reveal things you hadn’t considered maybe, e.g. your son’s room has a wall with a hot water pipe or in the slab.  And then take readings of pc/game equipment/tv/monitor etc.. keeping the pc clean can extend its life and might reduce the overheating a bit.

If you plan to be in this home for a long time think about options to keep more of the sun facing wall in the shade.  We did this for my mom’s south facing room with sun sails ? (Basically heavy duty but nice looking triangular fabric panels attached well above the window with two stainless eyes and included rope that in this installation made it to the side yard fence posts.  My dad was anti awnings (too mobile home looking he said) though some neighbors have gone that route.  Hanging sail cloth is cool cause you can set it high enough so you’re not messing with the view and you can easily detach in the winter when you might want more sunlight/heat.   This will help with your ac bill.

Landscaping is also an option, but growing anything close to a house can come back to bite you."
homeimprovementideas,fr467lm,t3_g3egz1,1589877225.0,"If you look up tips for finding studs you should find some.  My favorite way lately is to take a really lightweight clear bag, maybe a ziplock or the free bags at the grocery store you get by the butcher counter or produce, and then take super strong neodymium magnets and a magnet at a time slide along the wall.  The magnet will usually be strong enough to easily get through a certain amount of drywall mud and tape and stick to drywall screws.  Before long you have a fair number of these magnet discs on your wall and you almost see the obvious vertical lines of studs and you can tell if they are in fact 16” on center.  I can’t guarantee this will help if the old plaster wall is super thick before the nails or screws which go into the studs.

Another way to find studs I like is to look at the electrical outlets.  These should be nailed or screwed to an adjoining stud.  You may be able to simply remove the cover plate to look behind the outlet.

Ok, maybe I saved the best for last.  If your friend owns this home and the spot she wants the television seems like a good one where a set could always be installed you could propose surgically opening up the wall so the you don’t simply mount the tv on the wall (which actually means hanging off a bracket off the wall...) but in a cool niche.  It makes the installation look more custom if done right.  I remember working on a new custom home where we actually had the framing and drywall done to anticipate specific sizes sets and used mounts that could pull away for initial hookups but then push flat into the niches.  Essentially when done if you looked at the set from the side you just saw a very thin frame, no mount bracket and nor cords."

At night I highly recommend a remote controlled light bulb for your balcony fixture.  I hated going out at night and having a bright light in my eyes and putting me on display as it were.

Third, it’s not accurate to describe things in US history the way you have.  By the time white colonists arrived in North America this was a peculiarly sparsely populated land (compares to China, Europe, Africa, etc.).  Now to be sure, the single worst devastation to the indigenous populations was the introduction of pathogens for which the people here did not have immunity.  Even arguably the most infamous and evil moments in the history of US history and the various tribes don’t reach the level of genocide.

Alcoholism, drug abuse, domestic violence, and the utter mismanagement of resources (buying vehicles and not performing basic maintenance then simply storing the vehicle in the yard to get to later and buying a new vehicle).

As for what Epstein did vs Cosby, it’s hard to actually compare.  Drugging women into unconsciousness to rape them is horrific and he apparently did it a lot over decades.  Epstein has his accomplice find teenaged girls and they’d get paid to give him a massage which would usually turn into way more.  From what I read some of the girls actually turned into repeat providers.  Statutory rape, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, all horrible stuff too.  And I think we’re fairly confident he was supplying underage sex to the rich and powerful for favors and blackmail material.  Did Epstein do way worse? Maybe, for all we know he had straight up imprisoned sex slaves on that island at some point, maybe people got killed.   As for convicted in criminal court, Cosby ended up getting a heavy sentence.   Epstein skated the first time and then after years got picked up again for his New York activities.

Womanhood is a gift from God and an amazing result of evolution.  I won’t give you the official theology of Humanae Vitae cause God knows well what I was like at your age.  

Now one thing people complain about with NFP is that often a woman most wants and most enjoys intercourse when most fertile.  This is the design of course.  One interesting side note, the fact that peak fertility for a woman coincides with her peak pleasure and receptiveness suggests yet another way in which humans seem set apart from most creatures.  With many species the female enjoying matters seems irrelevant so long as reproduction happens (and there are the cases where the female kills and eats the male after sperm deposit).

My first serious girlfriend, also a Catholic, came to know almost just from touch when she was at peak fertility and I learned too.   And being hormonal teenagers our high iqs were practically useless when it came to staying apart.  But I never made a mistake (I hate to use that word cause sometimes I really think she and I should have ended up married, but yeah, her pregnant as an undergrad would have been a scandal).

And so when you know you’re at peak fertility no essence of life there...  But you two can still share all sorts of pleasure, even intercourse depending on the level of risk you can tolerate.

And my mom, God bless her, actually wrote in my baby book (you know those books where some moms record milestones and glue pictures for the early years) “This baby only likes to drink Coke.”  Funny, and horrific, and illustrates how between genetics and the environment in early years you can be dealt a horrible hand.  

I have at times been able to stay in pretty good shape and limit sugar, but the cravings for sugar for me have exceeded virtually any other in life over the long term, and that’s saying something cause for a while I felt like a sex addict and for a little while likes the other white powder.  My mom was recently telling me how she mostly just uses sugar to put herself to sleep.  “Mom, please, come on, there are much better ways to fight insomnia, I have over the counter and prescription drugs which can help you.”  And my mom of course progressed from gestational diabetes to eventually being the 2 and injecting insulin.  But my mom knows all the risks, we know people who’ve had partial amputations, damage to vision...  And my mom is quite smart, college educated.

It started to help me and was really promising but before long a nasty rash appeared on my trapezius and any rash means risk of SJS discontinue immediately or you could have a horrific death. Lorazepam is another name for one of those benzodiazepines iirc.

I was actually in the hospital for a while Saturday getting rehydrated and monitored after what was likely mild serotonin syndrome cause by polypharmacy.  And now I am completely off the latest SSRI my doc insisted I take in addition to Depakote prescribed by the neurologist which may have been helping to stop mania but was destroying my liver.  I am still on lithium because I still remember that my last manic episode only started to end when officers drew their Sigs on me (somewhat justified, they could have just asked me to walk towards them...).  And I didn’t get to see my son for Christmas.  And destroyed my credit and went through a fortune and nearly died multiple times.  And that episode of mania was so strong a single injection of Ativan actually just agitated me.  And even after the mandatory 72 hour hold complete with drugs the psychiatrist said I was still clearly not back to anything approaching level.  And my own mom apparently agreed and they kept me longer and really drugged the f out of me— it was a chemical lobotomy but my brain kept fighting it.  Everyone in my life assumed I was some dangerous monster and not one person would let me even crash in a guest room.  So I was finally transported to a halfway home which was a place I would never want to live in again.

So I finally realized that my manic depression, my type 1 plus temporal lobe epilepsy and PTSD and..., it had all finally proven well beyond my ability to control.  Which of course is what any researcher will tell you.  It’s a lifelong, chronic disease which can have periods of seeming remission but that’s usually not going to last and as you age and especially if you go through as many manic episodes I have you’re much more likely to go manic and have worse symptoms.  This is the kindling hypothesis which is close to being well accepted as fact.

If what you’re doing seems to be working I salute you and wish you continued success.  Hopefully you have at least one close person in your life educated about the condition lest you slip into mania. Lithium has some negatives of course, but it’s proven to reduce the rate of suicides and for most people prevent mania (it alone is only so so for me now).  Lithium also helps protect and even renew brain tissue which means that while decades of use may damage the kidneys, you’re far less likely to suffer the most severe cognitive impairment seen in most bipolar people as they age."

I am so tired of scorn and pity from people in my life that I’ve actually started being brutally honest when they make ignorant or cruel comments.  “Yes, my mood swings are annoying.  But I find your mediocre intellect and unimpressive education a detriment to conversations.  Furthermore, while we certainly suffer more than the majority and die younger, our tribe is way over represented among geniuses in so many fields.  Donkeys don’t suffer severe depression or mania—- forgive me, donkeys are actually useful animals.  So if you find me so problematic and pathetic don’t tax yourself and don’t waste my time talking about the latest episode of Tiger King you enjoyed.”— OK, we all know I haven’t unloaded like this on anyone in my life cause I have virtually nobody anymore.  But I sincerely believe that while we present so many difficulties for the right person we are so much more interesting and ultimately rewarding as a partner.

As a general rule I would recommend against the manic depressive man just as most people shouldn’t try to own a Hyacinth macaw or a harpy eagle or a monitor lizard.  We can be incredible lovers I’ve heard more than once."

I had to contend with some tweaker burglars last week.  It got tense cause I was outnumbered.  They were also younger and on drugs.  But I have training and have been in fights.  I was also bigger and stronger, but most importantly I had a stun baton and a combat folder.  Once they saw me draw the knife quickly and competently without taking my eyes off them they stopped advancing.  “You pull a knife?!l” “Damn right. Criminals want to gang up on me at night where I live, well I can guarantee that at least one of you will be seriously injured or worse if you attack.”  We had a standoff until a neighbor came out and joined in telling them to GTFO.  The police had been called by at least one neighbor, but of course they arrived too late to be of any help. 

So yes, weapons work as deterrents probably far more often than they need to be used to injure.  If you’re holding a bat most people don’t want any part of it."

If you’re strongly agnostic or a faithful atheist then any talk of transcendence probably seems way too mystical.

No, they still die, just of something else, something more protracted and more painful. 

As for suicide, once you realize that just as you don’t have the right to murder others the same applies to you.  You are a human being alive thanks to others, from your parents to all the people in society who invested and worked to provide for your immediate needs from the womb till tomb.

SuicideWatch,fqlfxtl,t1_fql74f2,1589456990.0,"Let the tears flow.  I was not in any way denigrating women for crying, if anything my experience gave me a new respect for women.  I do believe when I’d catch someone into stuff on the Hallmark channel it was like, “WTF? This is maudlin and corny, so sentimental, so sappy.”  (Not aloud usually, in the big world I am not as blunt as in here sometimes.). Then a change in biochemistry changed my whole take.  It still deeply troubles me that such a tiny pill could wreak such havoc on the human mind and body.  I fought the change, caught it as being out of my character, researched possible causes, and self diagnosed the condition.  My gp is a wise doctor, really smart and yet willing to listen to someone unlike most doctors who hate that you can read FDA warnings.  

This will sound a bit out there, especially from a guy who doesn’t embrace the current trend of encouraging men to transition.... but I suspect, propose that there would be a huge improvement in relations between men and women if many of us could experience how things feel and seem with different hormone levels.  Men might cut women slack for things that strike us as “weak” or “irrational”.  Women with the right hormone profile would be experience some of the male traits that probably annoy them.  A crazy sex drive for starters.  I have had women in my life who truly enjoyed sex, but the drive was never like that of a guy.  I almost forgot how intense male desire can be because of health issues and these nasty medicines.  Last week I had to quit two drugs cold turkey and ended up in the ER for blood work.  Well they decided to put me in a gown in a bed for a bit with an IV for hydration and meds.  Those hospital gowns aren’t too heavy and damn if my body went back to teenage mode since being freed of an SSRI and Depakote.  I wasn’t even thinking about anything remotely sexy and grubbing at full mast.  Flexing my thighs was doing nothing.  And now a young woman was entering the room (even with a mask on I would say she was perfectly fine looking, but not my type really). Before she could see I grabbed for my shirt as a cover. She drew multiple vials of blood but that didn’t change things.  We talked a bit (she was asking me what I had been saying to my nurse about THC and unmasking schizophrenia) and then she was off.  My straight male nurse didn’t notice.  Next a 5’9” good looking woman in glasses and a mask enters the room and looks at me and then down. “Are you cold?” “Not really, well...” “Would you like me to get you an actual blanket?” “Yes, please.”  And it’s a good thing because next she asks if she can fix my mask for me and she gets closer and bends the metal so there’s a tight seal and gently reseats it against my beard.  This small kindness and contact from an attractive woman had me so aroused.  And I swear to you I thought that part of life was gone and I almost felt like good riddance.

We like to think the ego or superego calls shots and sure, the civilized, respectful part of me did reign in the animal urges, but I had forgotten how ridiculously strong those urges can be.  And duh, those urges keep our species in existence, at least so far.  If the ladies could experience the ache, the longing, the craving and throbbing to... pardon me, not trying to write erotica, but even though I don’t have much use for Freud, he was onto something talking about the sex drive and death drive being intertwined and so powerful.  The ER can be exciting, but it’s also a place of life and death and also some attractive people.  Wouldn’t surprise me at all if some of them bang like rabbits on breaks or after a stressful shift."
SuicideWatch,fqle2pk,t1_fql0nk0,1589455377.0,"God bless you.  Sincerely.  Most men would not let down their guard and cry in front of a woman— especially if she’s not crying.  I didn’t have a healthy childhood.  When I was a kindergartner we lived in Monterey CA, a beautiful place, because my dad was stationed there for school.  He didn’t have to go to sea for two years! Maybe not so exciting as I recall it.  I had a lazy eye and ended up seeing a doctor for eye therapy exercises to strengthen the muscles.  My mom and dad both took me (my dad as a boy ended up needing surgery which was semi botched, but he still became an officer).  Afterwards I was happy and curious and looking at things when my parents started telling me to hurry up and stay with them.  At some point they grew extra annoyed with me and walked really fast to their old beige Volvo and drove away.  Accounts differ as to how long they were gone.  I was a bit upset to be ditched by my parents on an unfamiliar public street.  I do believe I cried.  And that didn’t go over well with Navy man. 

I can’t get into the rest, that was minor really— but the stuff when you’re really young sticks. “The child is father of the man.”

I think of our Lord. He wept.  Sorrow is part of the human condition, but so many of us our deeply wounded and damaged.  I also have type 1 bipolar.  In the manic phase there’s no crying unless from laughter.  And in the depressive phase when it’s really bad you are no longer emotional so much as in physical pain with a brain shutting down.  You barely speak.  The world grows dark.  For many of us hypersomnia sets in and waking hours are short and grey."

SuicideWatch,fql450u,t1_fqkp69f,1589445584.0,"I was in line to pick up prescriptions at Costco a couple years ago.  When I got to the window the woman working told me not to be a big baby.  I was there for meds to treat double pneumonia and a severe sinus infection/polyps.  I wasn’t crying or moaning, but the mere fact that my face showed discomfort she found contemptible.  I can’t recall if I just gave her a look or asked her when she last had such conditions or told her she was highly unprofessional.  

My baby mamma, my ex, but we actually mostly manage to be friends for the sake of our son has had a lot of boyfriends and even a few fiancés.  I was asking her once about some of the fiancés and why she never married any of them.  The story that really stands out is the trip to the movies she described.   He was Jewish, but not really observant.  They went to see Schindler’s List and at some point in the film she looked at him and thought he was crying.  In that moment she lost all interest in him.  She ended it soon after.  “What? That was a powerful film and based on things that happened.  He wasn’t emotional watching Bambi.” “Doesn’t matter.  He was now a crybaby Jew in my mind and I lost all attraction to him.  And I did him a favor really cause when I watched the movie I found the one Nazi kind of hot.”   

I have other examples that are even more extreme.  I have/had a fairly close Jewish girl friend (we dated briefly but we both realized we would ruin a friendship on a remote chance of things working between us).  She is beautiful, sexy, very smart, now an ambitious business owner (took over from her dad who battles a condition I have as well).  One of the last times we hung out together she decided to confide in me that she had had three abortions already.  What’s done is done.  I am not her confessor or judge, but she already knew me to be against elective abortion as a moral principle (the golden rule, ethic of reciprocity, if you appreciate that you were allowed to live...). I forget what I said if anything, but she said “Sometimes you have to be willing to get bloody to get what you want.  I mean I guess I should have been on some form of birth control years ago, but I don’t like unnatural hormones or things implanted.”  I was dumbfounded.  All of a sudden she struck me as monstrous.  Yet I didn’t bail and we stayed in touch.  That night she actually performed some sage burning ritual over a seriously injured leg from work.  I haven’t talked to her in four years.  She gladly rang up almost ten thousand dollars on my credit card at her business.  All I have to show for that night is a small piece of art, but a couple I never met before got a several thousand dollar bed.

My mom ended up speaking to her on the phone while I was in the hospital for mania.  She told my mom that I certainly didn’t seem like myself that night and would post a refund for new, returned merchandise, but nothing else.... What made this whole episode worse is that her dad has the same disease, perhaps type 2 so never quite as dramatic.

Anyway, I don’t want to think of every time I have encountered a vicious woman who seemed to delight in hurting men, particularly sensitive or wounded ones.  Maybe one last one.  My first serious girlfriend was in college.  I went to an all boys high school my first three years and just didn’t meet anyone I liked who like me for my last year at a coed school.  To this day I’ll sometimes enjoy remembering my first girlfriend and wondering how her life has gone and what could have been.  She was both loving and vicious as I discovered.  I was candid about my nearly utter lack of experience.  She was a virgin too, in the strict sense at least (I know it may seem naive to even believe anything but that was true).  She invited me to her dorm room when there would be at least a little privacy.  We were learning how to kiss really well together and at some point I wanted to kiss her everywhere which she enthusiastically welcome.  After bringing her to a nearly convulsive climax I went up to kiss her and hold her but she hauled off and smacked me the hardest anyone has ever smacked me.   

This was an intense moment, my first time ever bringing a woman to climax and the the first time I was ever struck like that by a woman.  I was stunned.  “What was that for?” “You lied to me.  Claiming you had no experience and..” “I didn’t lie.” “Oh sure, you just knew how to do everything right and where and... on your first try?l” “Maybe I’m a natural? I have studied anatomy, read about this, so I’m not just a cunning linguist?”  She didn’t find that convincing or cute.  She looked at the clock and declared I would have to spend the night but would have to sleep on the floor.  These were not coed dorms and security guards could be awfully strict about catching guys in the girl’s dorms.  I asked her to buy me a soda from down the hall (was thirsty and decided I was done savoring her taste given how bitter she turned). No.  Now maybe most guys would have stopped pursuing, but like some stupid puppy used to abuse and not knowing better, actually expecting and maybe wanting abuse, I became more smitten the worse she treated me.  And eventually she fell in love when I was almost over my infatuation.  The rest is maybe worth recounting another time.

My point is that there are plenty of women who are nasty pieces of work.  I truly enjoyed the film Nocturnal Animals because it was such a departure from most portrayals of men and women in films.  You get a real range of the types of men and you see a woman who had it all only to kill for something better in the eyes of the world."
SuicideWatch,fqkzx3y,t1_fqkwnhu,1589441499.0,"Interesting and to your credit.  Are you romantically attracted to even one of the cry baby guys? I don’t seem capable of crying in front of people.  The one big exception was when a medicine caused me to suffer hyperprolactinemia.  Prolactin is mostly a female hormone and lo and behold, I became fairly weepy watching The Hallmark Channel!  Once my doctors confirmed my suspicions with lab work I was off that medicine and returned to my stoic/aggressive self.  It was a huge insight into the human condition that a tiny pill could so mess up my neuroendocrine system and my thinking and feeling.  I got off the drug before growing breasts and lactating.

My point: that men not crying like women is not a mere social construct of our society but biological.  And most women are attracted to men.  Anybody who encourages a teenage boy or young man to cry in front of people does that guy a real disservice in most cases."

And she was livid we went to In N Out, of course she can’t actually say anything about a healthy diet given most days she tells him to have cereal for breakfast and lunch and sometimes dinner.

There are a lot of horrible ball busting harpies in our country.  And in my case tonight’s incident is minor compared to some of the stuff she pulls.  Don’t even get me started on the way the deck is stacked against dads in court and what it costs to be allowed to see your child.

Don’t misconstrue my point.  The man who would put his son in such danger is the guilty, responsible party— I am just saying that most of the time men don’t snap out of nowhere.  It’s ever increasing stress and emasculation and impoverishment that will lead to rage or seriously exacerbate a psychiatric problem.  I am actually amazed sometimes at how resilient most men are.

PublicFreakout,fqkb5rf,t1_fqiitof,1589423698.0,"At some point during my lifetime almost all of us accepted this programming without a question: “The proper response to an emergency is to contact the proper authorities. Doing this is the most noble act expected of citizens.  Attempting to stop a crime, save a life, render aid— all highly problematic and potentially ruinous to you.”  Partly it’s the nature of appeals to specialization, “Only those with the right training and tools and costumes- er, uniforms, can do anything.”  Don’t get me wrong, misguided help can hurt, e.g. you move someone with a spinal injury and actually further injure or even paralyze.  BUT often it’s absurd to delay while waiting for the so called trained expert help, like in this case.  You’re a grown man.  If you’re afraid of her with the brick you can lift a desk easily.  First, simply shouting as loudly and deeply as possible sometimes stops an attack.  In the time it takes security to arrive more blows to the head can cause permanent significant brain damage or death.  Remember Reginald Denny?

I get that our educators shouldn’t have to deal with this, but just as a human I would hope someone would step in if somebody were beating my head with a brick.  I have rendered aid, stopped fights, stopped crimes, and helped people with flat tires, dead batteries, and once a really heavy motorcycle a crashed guy could not lift. 

I don’t even tell people about these small acts of humanity not because I don’t want to share a story that makes me look good, but because often people tell me I shouldn’t get involved. “Jumping a car could electrocute you.” “They probably have AAA.” “Lifting a motorcycle? You could have hurt your back or he could have sued you if the bike slipped.” “A fight? Now one of them will want payback!”  Some of those concerns may be valid, but overall it’s the cowardly and selfish approach to life.  Only look out for yourself and maybe your kids.  Even your spouse can be abandoned at the first sign of trouble.

Yes, I know that some schools forbid any contact between an educator and a student under any circumstance.  I know this will sound insane: as important as any one job or career seems, saving a kid’s life and preserving your honor trumps that and most of the time you will in fact be just fine. Your lawyer or union rep or doctor writes that you were in shock at seeing a student being killed and did not break policy because at that moment you couldn’t remember policy— you just saw the need to save a life.  And some places are pushing back with Good Samaritan laws that protect those who help.

There are some charitable decisions I regret, but I can’t think of any time I rendered aid which I now regret.  In fact, helping another is about the best feeling in life for me."

They will learn how to do all sorts of stuff on their own that other people get paid to do.  And they enjoy their equipment.  So just as most people simply buy cars, there are guys who end up getting so into cars that they do almost all of their own maintenance and upgrades.  During this lockdown a man at our complex repaired/rebuilt a Subaru.

BudgetAudiophile,fqgdme3,t1_fqg66mq,1589343606.0,"Amen.  I’ve worked in audio at different levels and while I appreciate the fidelity of better equipment, enjoyment of much music doesn’t require expensive gear.  Consider the human voice.  Do you recognize easily the voice on the other end of the phone line? Or a really cheap clock radio? 

Truth be told, most people in the industry come to realize that there is a real steep curve on money spent versus actual enjoyment and that many people buy expensive gear not because they love music so much, but they enjoy the tech and the philosophy and the hobby (and I wouldn’t criticize many of those people, many used to provide my livelihood).  

Solid, acoustically inert cabinets are not a mystery and not that pricey.  Same for most of the things in audio.  To me the hardest thing to do well cheaply would be extremely deep bass, but even this has gotten less expensive with digital amplification and sensors to monitor and control the driver/unwanted excursion/resonance.   Now I’ll get ridiculed for not realizing that you MUST get a turntable tone arm cartridge combo retailing for the price of a Honda.  Or you have to have professionals come run eq and treat for sound.

The single greatest audio value will be a set of headphones that you both enjoy wearing and listening to (and I went ahead and got a portable amp because before my life fell apart a while before Corona it was clear I spent more time out than home).

It’s a schooner! If someone does show interest in the hobby do your best to remember you too once knew nothing about the hobby.  If a fairly subtle performance gain doesn’t jump out to them let it slide.  Many of the performance gains audiophiles enjoy are placebo.

If you only support people who largely agree with you or disagree in a socially approved way then you’re not actually for FREE speech.

As I recall, Anglin was almost driven from the web for good after he made fun of Heather Heyer in the wake of her death in Virginia.  I don’t want to misquote him, but it was something about her being a fatter who died of a heart attack more than from a car hitting her.   Cruel? Yes, obviously that’s a vicious thing to say about someone who just died.  True? I don’t know, I mean she was obese and other people in the video suffered worse impact injuries if memory serves—- but guess what, it’s irrelevant to the question of whether or not he has the right to express unpopular opinions in writing on a site nobody is forced to ever visit.

Dr Dre is now a billionaire someone told me.  All of these people can be given multiple chances or total free passes— and those are actions, not opinions.  Bill Clinton, a member of the bar and a former governor and president probably raped women, definitely behaved wildly inappropriately, but he gets a perjury slap and that’s it— he still makes a fortune selling access to power as his nasty wife in name only angles for the presidency.

No, I am NOT endorsing the daily stormer.  I am an American.  My ancestors fought to defeat Hitler.  Fascination and admiration for those vile losers is so strange.  I will say that raising ethnic awareness may sadly become necessary because we unfortunately find ourselves being attacked simply for being white or having earned anything.  The media and many leaders seem intent on stirring up racial hatred against whites.  Take this case in Georgia. I can’t even imagine forming a posse with my dad to go detain a suspected criminal, but of course my dad is not a recently retired investigator and I don’t keep a gun in my vehicle where a thief can get it.  So they do something reckless and dangerous and try to stop a stranger.  But then the stranger does something suicidal: he attacks a man holding a shotgun.  Watch the video a couple times, maybe you’ll need to slow it down, but plain as day you see him not simply grab the shotgun (itself a very misguided choice) but punch the son in the head more than once.  Some reporting now says that the first discharge was caused by the decedent grabbing the weapon.

Now in a society that supposedly values the rule of law and doesn’t want to mess with the justice system leaders should shut up and the media shouldn’t try to incite riots and racial tension.  These guys are in custody. They will be tried.  But if leaders keep poisoning the potential jury pool... And please, this is a horrible amplification of the nonsense with Trayvon Martin where everybody is supposed to pretend the dead person was just an innocent little boy, a saint among us.  Truth seems to be that this father and son ill advised volunteer crime fighter force didn’t accidentally kill an innocent jogging enthusiast, but somebody with a criminal background and mental problems.

We’re all going to die, just not of Corona.  I had to go to the hospital Saturday and it was surreal.  It was almost empty and I got put into a room with a bed in just minutes.  I really only wanted some important bloodwork done which can’t easily be done the normal way cause of all this.  Not once did the ER doc even ask me to remove my mask or check my lymph glands.  I wouldn’t say he was bad at his job, just that the obsession with this virus has clouded judgment and allowed for strange practices to emerge.  I was no there for any complaint about lung function, but the first thing that happened after I got into the gown and bed was a Mobile X ray unit was wheeled in and bam, chest x Ray (tech was in such a rush I had to ask and grab the led blanket for the jewels (not that any more children are likely in my future—but why any unnecessary radiation?). The tech laughed and said it’s very little radiation (hmm, why the fuss at dentists and hospitals in the past?).  Family in medicine told me a lung x Ray is the fastes way to see telltale signs of damage possibly from Covid.

Ok, then what I really needed, IV fluids.  But with the bang hanging a lovely woman comes in the room and says she’s taking me for a CAT scan with contrast.  She also asked if she could fix my mask for me.  Anyway, long story short my blood work shows a few things of real concern, but you know what call I got within probably exactly 48 hours? A nurse telling me my nasal swab test for Covid came back negative.  Ok, well I wasn’t concerned about that but the likely serotonin syndrome which hadn’t gone away after days.

It also occurs to me that the nearly empty hospital may have generated a lot of money in bills the feds pay without blinking usually.  While thing was trippy.  So the iv fluids and anti nausea/pain relief really helped and they were able to chart my pulse and blood pressure all over the map.

Maybe a dog walker trying to find land mines? Then a gloved hand forces its way between the running box fan and window frame and goes exploring.  I reacted by shouting as loud and deep as possible “What the fuck are you doing?”  The forearm and hand jerked back and a simultaneously startled but snarky woman says back, “I’m looking for my friend. Chill.”  This lie pissed me off more if that’s possible.  Got geared up with less than lethal (lethal if needed options) and headed out ( two locked doors to set and securing the window ).

Her yell summoned her accomplices, two “men” who immediately started threatening me and then spread wide to flank me.  This is when my fight or flight mode kicked in and my reason tried to help.  I knew I couldn’t turn and outrun the three and honestly I’d rather get into some savage brawl than runs while defending my rights where I live.  

I told them they were all criminally trespassing (true) but if they took off we’d fall it a night.  Lead guy filled with drug courage and numbers on his side decided to lie to my face.  I laughed but was now even more resolved not to budge.  He balled his fists and put on a silly flexing show.  His buddy was quiet as he approached and those are usually the worse types.  This was unsportsmanlike and when they both advanced I pulled my combat folder, the exact legal limit in this state, given to me by my SWAT cop brother who also showed me basic handling.

bipolar,fqael4r,t3_ghqfv8,1589217745.0,"Good morning,

I have been on 1,500 mg of lithium since 2016 as well as Depakote (for epilepsy as well as its anti mania properties).  I take propranolol to stop tremors probably from lithium (it’s also good at slightly lowering blood pressure and calming).  I also take amiloride to help deal with polyuria, again from lithium.  Until very recently my doctor had me taking generic Lexapro, an SSRI meant to fight depression.  At those times when I still can’t sleep and mania seems closeI am supposed to take 100 mg of generic Seroquel (Quetiapine). 

Ok, sorry if that was long.  Since being on lithium I have not been hospitalized.  I’ve also gained weight with these drugs and gone from in control blood sugars to elevated numbers and a type 2 diabetes diagnosis.  It’s tough for me to encourage you with lithium if you’re in your 20s or 30s because while it is still the gold standard in many ways for type 1 bipolar patients,  it also is not a drug many people can safely take for several decades (the rest of your life).  It’s well known to harm the kidneys over time.

Now at one point my psychiatrist had me try Lamictal (lamotragine) and it was a gradual increase in dosage and I started to feel great, both calm and alert, like my younger self when in between the mood swings.  And then at around 100 mg a rash developed on a trapezius headed towards my neck.  Well that meant I had to immediately stop the drug.  It was so frustrating, but SJSyndrome is one of the worst things a person can suffer so my doctor assured me it was no longer worth any risk.

Now you will meet many bipolar people on Lamictal who swear by it and from my short time on it I can see why.  You may want to discuss this with your doctor.

Almost all doctors resist patients self diagnosing or suggesting treatments.  What I have found works though is to bring a doctor medical literature from other doctors/scientists.  It was a kind doctor here on Reddit who recommended amiloride and provided me the links to papers about using it.

Speaking of medical literature, how do you know lithium has anything to do with your platelets??  I was in the hospital recently and have a low MPV (mean platelet volume).  There are many things that can cause low or high platelets.

How are you doing as far as your overall health? Things like exercise, diet, connection to other, and a sense of purpose...?

I am very sorry if this was too long.  I wish you all the best.  If you have any questions please respond here or PM.

Listen, you hate white people, I get it.  It’s actually cool to see it spelled out so clearly on the internet.  The internet, almost entirely the invention of white people.  Did you use a computer to post?  Something with an integrated circuit.  You’re plugged into power right?  Real talk, almost everything you enjoy in civilization was invented by crackers.  As for the contributions to civilization by African Americans, well there are certainly some, but as my black friend Kenny actually says, we’re living in a white man’s world and anyone who has spent any time in Africa prefers this place.

So is a random black man of a certain age range likely to be better at fighting than an Asian or caucasian? I guess that could well be, though black people as a group overall are the least healthy.  

Anyway, I know my comment probably won’t help you with your anger and envy, but perhaps if you reflect a bit you will realize that you’re lucky to live in this cracker country.  Crackers are only about 11% of the world’s population, but black people enjoy the highest standards of living in cracker countries.  You could certainly go live in a country with no crackers or very few, but then you would be forced to really reconsider your hatred.  Go see how Chinese people treat blacks.  Try Mexico.  

As for me, I am glad America has black people.  Jazz, the blues, much of rock and roll, inventors of all sorts (from George Washington Carver to Lonnie Johnson), and artists and entertainers.  Denzel Washington is probably my favorite actor of the last decades.  And in my personal life I have had good black friends.  Just a few days ago I was in a standoff with three criminals (story for another time) and the only neighbor with the guts to physically come outside and help end the situation without bloodshed was black.   And the worst victimizations as a child and adult that I personally have endured were all at the hands of fellow crackers.

Anyway, I hope you learn to view people as individuals first and judge by character.  It was the vision of Martin L. King.  It’s the only path forward for all of us as neighbors and countrymen."

For some weird reason a lot of people think knifes are trivial compare to a gun.  Experts have determined that once two people are close to each other the knife wielded often has total advantage over the person drawing a firearm from a retention holster.  And knife wounds aren’t just incredibly painful and incapacitating, but frequently fatal.  

One training exercise some police academies do is have cadets face off at given distances.  One will either have a rubber knife with some paint or dye on part or even just a big sharpie.  This cadet gets to have it in his hand while the other cadet has a training gun (replica or sometimes a real one that’s unloaded obviously or has some training round).  Instructor will randomly shout and the confrontation is on.  And almost never does gun cop emerge unscathed and sometimes knifey gets the total jump and owns the cop who is slow unholstering and aiming.

Knives are simple but elegant and so reliable.  Guns can jam.  Sometimes the crook struggles for the gun or gets a finger in behind the trigger.  Meanwhile you can slice and slash and stab and if the cop ends up wrestling the criminal that knife can find its way into soft flesh so easily.

So if your point is people are still capable of evil, indeed.  Don’t think a homicide in Georgia in February was needed to realize this.  And all of the fake outrage and virtue signaling by Hollywood morons may lead to more bloodshed."

Even if you want to think that we gradually evolved in some sense, our intellectual development has been exponential.  There are many species alive today virtually unchanged for huge periods of time, but in the incredibly short span of several thousand years behold all of civilization."
fasting,fpv56sg,t1_fpuxf10,1588935286.0,"Well it depends on your goals and what you do for a living.  I worked in construction for a long time.  Much of it was intensely physical for 8 hours a day.  Now a bodybuilder will be doing time under tension, progress to failure etc.. and those guys are of course strong, but strength doesn’t look just one way.  Compare powerlifters to bodybuilders to strongmen to strong men (obviously some overlap). 

I remember a company trying to lure me away once after an exchange I had with their foreman on site. “How can you still smile after running those wheelbarrows all day in the sun?” “Well, usually I like to pretend my company is paying me to exercise, to train for something.”  And for a while I spent the money to up my protein intake and bam, muscles started swelling.  Most construction workers are not going to spend limited money on protein shakes and supplements.  They’re strong enough and lean enough to be good at the job—- in fact more than one experienced worker/super would tell me that rarely did the bodybuilder types have the right stamina power/weight ratio to be ideal workers.  My brother in law is living proof of this.  He’s probably only 150 lbs at 5’10”, but he is freakishly strong.  He can bust out 20 pull ups while a son of his is hanging off his back.  If he’s working on his own home I have seen him do freakish strength/balance things. 90 lb sack of mortar mix on one shoulder, some 2*4s on the other.

Anyway, sorry to ramble, getting inspired to start exercising again! Thanks!"

All of the studies seem to agree that promiscuity is bad news, especially while still maturing.  The latest one I saw, probably here on Reddit, was a finding that promiscuity at least doubled the cancer risk.  Another study found that among adults looking for a life partner, 0 partners could be off putting (why is this guy a Virgin at 30?), but more than a few was really off putting.

Nowadays with so many porn addicted guys pressuring for more and more obscene things. And then there’s the risks of revenge porn and such.

I think I’m glad to have a son.  Though that’s not what it once was either.

If I had a girl would I be sending her mixed messages by explaining why waiting for love and trust to explore sex is better but then having her mom help her with contraception “just in case”.  

Parents are of course all over the place.  You hear about the ones who let their kids part and have sex in the home “at least I know where they are and it’s a safe scene.”  Then you have the father daughter virginity pledge dance things.  Or the Muslim approach where the girl is never out without a male relative chaperone."

By itself it’s highly unlikely to be of tremendous therapeutic value, but for many people with PTSD and anxiety a game can provide a lot of time free of symptoms.  I wouldn’t dismiss it as a silly coping mechanism because for many of us the previous coping mechanisms were chain smoking, heavy drinking, drug use/abuse.

In the US the single largest cause of PTSD: car collisions.  I have a relative who has a violent, dangerous job (SWAT, gang suppression, plain clothes detective) and was shot at multiple times from a few feet away (gang member pulled alongside of his marked car and just opened up)—- this causes serious trauma (and facial lacerations and hearing loss, but miraculously he went flat across the bench seat narrowly escaping death.  Fast forward to the last year and he’s on a family trip to Costco in a nice neighborhood with his pregnant wife and their child in back.  A drunk driver loses control gets partially airborne and hits their Explorer stopped at the red light.  The Explorer is totaled.  The drunk at first tried to escape, bad call.  As it turns out they all had relatively minor injuries, well the baby on the way was 100% healthy and the little guy in his seat was just freaked out.  But both husband and wife still will wake up to nightmares of that incident, as it happened, versions where they lose one or both children.   

Anyway, there’s the event and then there’s the unique person who goes through it.  

I have mild PTSD from 19 years ago at this point.  I avoid reminders.  I know breathing exercises to calm myself if I get caught off guard by vivid recall.  In my case it’s not so much visuals, but a particular smell I thankfully have rarely encountered since."

Are your rails pressure treated? Posts steel?  I have a friend who got obsessed with her fence (security, privacy, dogs inside, coyotes outside).  So her fence has steel posts, pt rails, concrete under everything (she used to breed rabbits), but of course the boards still got attacked.  So she’d either treat them or just have me replace bad ones to avoid the termites from spreading."

Porn is a serious problem and polluted far too many minds.  I will not argue against that point which even scientists now see.  But must guys who fall into it aren’t organizing parades, exposing kids to it, or so earring deadly diseases by indulging.  And I haven’t seen anybody in this subreddit claim it’s great and perfectly good since men are born to be aroused by visual stimuli after puberty."

We’re at the point that drag queens with criminal records are celebrated for putting young children on their laps for story time in libraries and schools.

See this is the thing, when it comes to some thins you find that a good faith attempt at tolerance emboldens utter degeneracy.  And any thinking person already saw this with HIV AIDS and how that spread through drug fueled sodomy among strangers to killing kids like Ryan White by tainting the blood supply needed by people with hemophilia.  Now obese queen Elton John sensed that possible pr nightmare and got extra praise for meeting the child...

Nowhere in the history of Judaism or Christianity is there a celebration of sodomites, but now in 2020 these would be scripture scholars think they have some great argument for sodomy as just as good as the union between man and woman that yields life.  

We are all sinners in a fallen world.  We all fall short and need redemption.  As for being born with defects or crosses to bear, this is not unique to those homosexuals who truly declare they have always felt such cravings.  I was born with various genetic diseases and predispositions, but I don’t try to remake the world in my image.  Like about 10% of men I don’t see colors right.  It has its pros and cons, but I don’t lobby for abolishing colors that I can’t really enjoy.  I have epilepsy, don’t expect the world to cease any and all things that can trigger a seizure which may even prove fatal.  I am type 1 manic depressive, don’t even get me started, around 25% of us kill ourselves—- is that cool now since this disease is genetic and epigenetic from childhood trauma??  

I can list lots of imperfections, but the fact that they weren’t chosen doesn’t mean anything about whether correlated behaviors should be condoned or celebrated.  It’s just a ludicrous argument.  I have PTSD from what I experienced in NYC 19 years ago, am I allowed to beat the next Arab I encounter who tells me America deserved it because of support for Israel?? It’s almost happened already, but thanks to grace and a semblance of self control I didn’t let the rage flow."

Bouncers serve a role, but if we’re all being honest, many of them look for an excuse to get violent and often gang up on much smaller drunks who have often done next to nothing.  I’m a good size, but won’t play Internet tough guy and claim I can fight multiple bouncers (I can’t, especially if drunk)—- the only time I had a real negative interaction was at a huge venue in Philly long ago. I was there with what would become a serious girlfriend and her best friend.  The place was overcrowded in one area and the bouncers decided they would heed some people to another area, but instead of being decent about it they were just shoving and grabbing.  Saw a hand grab one of the girls and I just reacted. Shouted at the guy and startled him and he let go, but they don’t like anything resembling a challenge. Two of them grab me from behind by either my belt loops or top of my jeans and I am in this horribly awkward situation. The girls follow behind telling them to chill and let go.  Well I get shoved out a door onto some side street/alley.  And then the women burst through the door.  And they made me feel like their knight (right before that I was feeling pretty low, wasted cover, all worked up when the girls were making out a bit, now tossed into an alley alone).   Anyway, we ended up going to Pat’s and I have little doubt they spared me at least getting thrown into the pavement or worse.
