Anxiety,f5exy7l,t3_dnp44x,1572176087.0,I know it sounds stupid but I listen to podcasts.  There are so many podcasts out there to choose from.  I constantly have something playing if I'm not around someone I don't know or alone to keep the racing thoughts and magical thinking away.  I don't get lost in my anxiety as much anymore.  My family finds it annoying but it help so much.  I haven't had that jumbled knot of anxiety  in my stomach.  I still get anxiety but I can hand the daily anxiety.

cats,f0v0qdw,t3_d6q0l2,1568958042.0,It looks like something I get all the time there called mucocele.   In cats their more susceptible to oral swelling in and around their salivary glands.  It's usually just a pocket of mucus that pops by its self but sometimes may need help from a vet or dentist.  I had a cat that that they gave me some pills to help release the fluid slowly.

cats,eyxbcpb,t3_cywcc9,1567549128.0,"The vet said it's UTI and that it common in female spayed cats.  Bean got a shot and some antibiotics to take home.  Boy, was she not a happy camper.  They said the entire time she was there when she was put in the kennel she would just face the corner and not look at them.   She happy and I happy to have her home.  Thanks for any advise it really helped calm me down."

cats,eybxdc6,t3_cwftgf,1566993366.0,I've always given them an old used sock of mine something that smells like nothing but you.  Then just give them their space.  Give them food and water.  Make sure they have places they can climb so they can feel safe and on their own turf.  My cat have eventually came to me.  Don't pet them unless they come to you or you risk scaring them off.  When they feel comfortable and safe they'll come to you.
depression,exzv4jq,t3_cuorzz,1566671010.0,Podcast constantly.  I have to like the peoples voices too.  Even if I'm not really listening I'll have something I've already listen to on.  Can't stand silence for some reason it makes chest feel like it's just expanding and then I have time to think about stuff that I don't want to think about.

cats,exkighh,t1_exkgblw,1566390514.0,I agree you should really talk to a vet if you haven't done so already.  With cats it's easy to miss if something wrong because they're generally so standoffish and loner animals especially if you've only had them for a short time.  The don't voice their discomfort often and it tends to go unnoticed for a long time.  It might be something very simple that your vet can determine with a more thorough examination.
cats,eu65e1c,t3_cezv44,1563492523.0,"My cat were spayed when they were a bit older so they'd all ready calmed some.  But if your worried call your regular vet in the morning and ask him or her their advise.  I call and ask questions all the times to save them having to deal with me all the time, if one of my pets has a 
procedure."

It luck like some dumbass with too much time and a pocketknife."
Anxiety,et7yqtg,t3_c9u0iv,1562541745.0,Yep.  Nothing more calming than laying in the fetal position while my dogs snuggle around me and my cat lays on top of me.  The purrs and dogs even breathing just give me something to concentrate on.
Aquariums,esxk2wz,t1_esu62jo,1562331642.0,Yep.  Texas to be exact.  Total population rounds to 3500.  Closest mall is 40 minutes away and really good shopping is like 2 hours away.

Pets,epdej0b,t1_epd9195,1559165082.0,Thanks I've already ordered the martingale collar and I'm look for a good sporn harness for Pennie.  She a very prey drive dog so I like the idea of double up. She's already killed a possum and a dove that happened to be unlucky enough to get in our back yard.   I'm just afraid she would see a squirrel and slip out of the usual harnesses and make a run into the road before I had a chance.
Pets,epbxz1o,t3_bu9ffl,1559148102.0,My dog killed a possum about a week ago. I talked to my vet she said that since she didn't eat it and is up to date on her rabies shots she'd be fine.  Just keep an eye on her.  It's extremely rare for a possum to contract rabies but not impossible.  I live in a more rural town in Texas and both my dogs have killed a rat and dove.  They've never been interested in eating anything that they kill.
