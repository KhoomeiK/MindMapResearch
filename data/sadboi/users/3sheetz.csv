They are going to get as close to people as they did before all of this and probably not stand further away than normal because if they aren't wearing a mask they probably don't think this is a big deal.

And the CDC has instructions on how to use a bandanna as a face mask, so I would think they are at least a little helpful. Definitely not 100%, but that is the point of staying at minimum 6 feet from people, washing your hands, not touching your face, reducing the amount of people in a store, etc. Plus, face masks of any kind reduce face touching, so they are not just for airborne virus particles.
