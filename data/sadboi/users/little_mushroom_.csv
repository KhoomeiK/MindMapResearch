I am eating a lot of different things on this elimination diet that I do not normally eat of course. One of them is the gf trader joes bread to your point. Also having Mac milk. Tuna. Popcorn. More salad and oranges. Otherwise meats and such. Hmm. I don't know.

Thanks for your time and I'll give this some thought."

Another side issue. I switched from soy to lactaid. But quit that a few days ago after some severe symptoms that seemed dairy related ( tho I thought I would be ok with lactaid milk). Sigh. Now I'm on macadamia milk. Anyway, ha. Thanks for listening."
