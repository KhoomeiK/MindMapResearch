kratom,fqx37dv,t3_gl248j,1589724749.0,Just wanted to add that there are supplements you can take that lower your tolerance to kratom so you can take less. I believe that they are helpful for  withdrawing from opioids as well. Agmatine is one that I take daily and I have just discovered PEA (palmitoylethanolamide) that works very well. Both of these are normally used for joint pain but are great for tolerance. Good luck!

Long story short, my period did not come back on it's own with the weight gain. I think because i was 16 and still developing i screwed up my hormones. Later, at 28 I was having 0-1 periods per year and needed hormone therapy to get it back and become pregnant. It worked but it was expensive (abt $6000 total).
