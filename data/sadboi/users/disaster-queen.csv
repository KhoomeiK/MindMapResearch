PCOS,f5qtjyo,t3_dougjk,1572382759.0,I could never do full Keto. I find reducing my Carbs (100 or less) to be sufficient to help me lose weight and feel better.

PCOS,f36rb2a,t3_dfxu2t,1570716419.0,"Ha, no joke I was just considering making a post about how I can‚Äôt quit cheese, keto recipes, and PCOS. My endo has not told me to quit dairy, but I think about it bc of the recommendations I see. Some of my symptoms have gotten better with just carb cutting and exercise alone however, I do wonder what would happen if I took the leap and got rid of dairy all together. I cut out dairy creamer and milk years ago and have been using almond milk and almond creamer. It‚Äôs really just cheese I can‚Äôt ditch for good. I can do a day without it every now and again. It‚Äôs mostly bc I use it as a snack and a lot of my recipes call for some sort of cheese."
depression,f34xuy5,t3_dfoadp,1570663396.0,"I‚Äôm lucky that I have 1 person who I can tell my thoughts too. I have some other friends that get the ‚Äúgist‚Äù of my depression but I don‚Äôt deep dive into it so much. I‚Äôve learned who cares more than others. I was never able to talk to my parents about my symptoms. Although my mother had developed a sever anxiety d/o 1 year after having me, whenever I told her about my depression (when I was a teenager) she would just get annoyed and say, ‚Äúwhy are you doing this to me.‚Äù I tried a few times as an adult and she would just lecture me on how I ‚Äúhave a good life and have nothing to be depressed about.‚Äù She‚Äôs the kind of person that feels that their suffering/issues are worse than anyone else‚Äôs. I just stopped trying to talk to her about anything and now I hardly have anything of substance to say to her. Find new people to talk to. There are people out there that will care and support you."
