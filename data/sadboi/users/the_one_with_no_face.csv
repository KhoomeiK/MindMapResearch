 I think it's safe to assume that most of us Americans have absolutely no idea what's happening, and that's why we conspire the most ridiculous ideas. Currently, a couple of states are starting to reopen their economies. The premise is, though, that only a particular group of people are selected to go back to work for observational purposes. There's also a threat of a second wave of this, but hey, let's see if people will still die. 

Questions that directly affect us here go unanswered. Instead, news outlets are reporting on death tolls and offering condolences (I mean that in a metaphorical sense) while we've got nothing to do but to absorb information the media offers.

You guys are gonna scream at me. 

I smoke. Like half a pack a day, so not too crazy. 

I had symptoms that fit under the criteria of covid-19 a couple months back. How may I have caught it? I live and work in an area where travel tends to be rampant. I work in a salon. It's possible that a client of mine carried it and passed it along (this was while there were *very* few cases in my area, I think there were 3 confirmed within a 100 mile radius at the time). I started coughing uncontrollably one day and left work after an hour and went home to rest. 

The next day, I was in immense pain. My chest especially felt like it took a beating. I couldn't breathe properly, I had a gnarly headache, and a sore throat. I was familiar with the flu, so at the time that's what i had figured and blew off the idea to get tested.

A week later, my voice was officially gone, and the coughing started to slow down. I was no longer in pain. 

The week after, the coughing was no longer painful, but comparable to congestion. 

The week after (week 3) my voice slowly returns 

And now I'm healthy as I was before I got sick.

Super easy job, and it gets the bills paid. Fortunately, I would have earned enough to get a full body makeover, complete with extensive cosmetic surgery. However, upon consulting with some of the best surgeons in the area, I was told that it was physically impossible to make me even remotely attractive. So, here I am, all this money and none of it will put me on the scale of attractiveness :'("

AskReddit,ez85lwx,t3_d09mf0,1567734762.0,"I'm the suicidal one. My mom was the one that stopped me. 

I had planned on a specific day earlier this year, and I had gone as far as scouting for locations, so my body wouldn't be found for awhile. The only person that was even aware that I was planning anything was my sister, who worked in the ER as a nurse. Her pleading was not enough to stop me. 

So about 2 or 3 days before my scheduled day, my mom's pill addiction caught up with her and she got arrested. No one else in the family had the balls to take responsibility, so I had to step up and manage everything. Many mental breakdowns and months later, I still get suicidal thoughts, but I've been able to get medicated (as a result of getting help for my mom) myself and I feel like that has physically weighed me down from acting on it."

I'm a single female that is working on moving back out of the parents house as well, and because I dont even have any savings, I try to prepare as much as I can depending on when I get paid. 

I plan do quit one job and just work 2 jobs, but that possibly won't happen until a full year from now. 

I do have a dream job, and none of the 3 jobs have anything to do with that unfortunately. However the 2 jobs I want to keep are pretty okay. And theres a shit job I need to keep until everything in my life is stable."

Also, I'm in a group of other black sheep and we get along like blood brothers, so that's fun."
