I'm not saying the government is lying to us right now, but they have before, and they will again in the future. So when shit like this comes out, it's extremely hard for me to blindly put my faith into known liars and actual pieces of shit. I always take what they say with a massive grain of salt.

But I refuse to blindly follow politicians who are the biggest liars and phonies on the planet, most of which have an agenda they're trying to push to get re-elected.

Edit: Downvote me, it's all good. This is what opinions/reddit is for. Maybe I'm wrong, I very likely am. But I always ask questions first, and do my own research as well. I just cant blindly believe a lot of things people tell me. I'm taking precautions, just like everyone else, maybe I just have trust issues, who knows?
