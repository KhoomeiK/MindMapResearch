I'd also recommend having a nice chunk of savings. It takes longer to find a job in a place where you have no contacts. It took a lot longer than I thought. Housing can be tricky too until you have stable income, so take that into consideration. I did a weekly rental in ones of those residential motels and that was expensive. I'm sure there are better options these days, so I'd scope it out before you go.

mentalhealth,fq60utl,t3_ggvgas,1589122118.0,"Honestly your story sounds similar to mine, and I suffer from complex PTSD. Before I got into therapy, I thought I was just depressed and anxious, with a shitty childhood that realistically could've been worse. When my therapist brought up PTSD, I didn't know that much about it. I thought it was a diagnosis primarily for soldiers or victims of some horrendously violent crime. But it's actually much more complicated and diverse.

Trauma can be a lot of things. Sometimes trauma, especially repeated trauma (even if it seems comparatively mild), can actually change the neurological pathways in our brains. In PTSD, it literally rewires the way we think/feel. I'm not trying to diagnose you or anything, but

>bullied as a kid
>raised dirt poor
>narcissistic absent mother

are all potentially traumatic childhood experiences that you lived with during your most formative years, and even one of those have the potential to cause severe long-term emotional damage without proper treatment. (Not saying it always does, but some of us aren't given the right resources when we need them.) Your symptoms are all very familiar to me was well (memory loss, depression, derealization, dissociation, etc). I recommend checking out other communities on here like r/PTSD r/CPTSD r/raisedbynarcissists etc to see how you identify with people there. And regardless of what you're suffering from, please try to get yourself into therapy if you aren't already. That way you can hopefully get a true diagnosis and real, helpful treatment. Don't wait until your 30s like I did. So many years wasted.

As for suspected sexual abuse, I absolutely, positively would **not** recommend digging for potentially repressed trauma without a trusted and trained trauma therapist. Trauma work is HARD and really requires the help of a professional.

I found email to be the easiest way to make that first appointment. (I was waaay too anxious to call!) She didn't ask for details or anything, we just set up a day & time and she sent me some paperwork to fill out and bring to the first appointment. Honestly, making that first contact was the hardest part and it all got easier from there. It took many, many sessions before I felt safe enough to dig into the harder stuff, and although I trust my therapist completely now, I still struggle to bring up particularly tough subjects, even when I want to! (I've told her this and she said it's okay and also pretty common.) She's given me alternative methods to bring up things that I typically freeze up over. (For example, I can email her and tell her I want to talk about a certain thing at our next session, or I can send her a journal page, etc.)

It's great to have trusted friends in your life that you can open up to! I do recommend seeing a professional for trauma stuff though. There is a huge physical component to PTSD that most people don't understand, and well-meaning friends can cause unintentional harm. Plus, a trained trauma therapist has so many amazing tools to help us! For that reason, I would look for someone who specializes in trauma.

My husband and I are both pretty responsible with finances (after having learned some lessons) but we have different methods of money management. So we each have our own checking/savings accounts that we had before we got married, and we have joint accounts as well. Shared expenses are paid out of the joint accounts, which we each contribute to (though he pays extra for certain luxury items/upgrades he prefers). We each pay our own personal expenses (car, student loans, medical bills, etc) and take spending money out of our own accounts as we see fit. It works for us.

As for POA, I'm my mom's instead of her husband of ~20 years. He's not sick or senile or anything, he's just bad with making decisions in general, so I would say it depends on you and your spouse.

You didn't ask a question or for advice, so I'll just share my experience and leave you the opportunity to follow-up with any questions. 

I do EMDR with my regular therapist. For most of my sessions, we don't do EMDR, we just talk. I have a long history of trauma of that I started unwinding with her about 2 yrs ago now. When I'm feeling up to it, and she feels like it would be beneficial, we do EMDR. Usually we dedicate a session to it. I decide on it beforehand so I can mentally prepare myself. I always get nervous before these sessions. My therapist helps me get into a good mental space, and then we get to work. She moves her fingers and I follow them with my eyes; we don't use any special equipment. Sometimes, particularly if I'm getting worked up, she'll switch to knee taps. I feel a lot of sensations in my body during EMDR, and we talk about that a little bit at intervals. Sometimes I cry during sessions, but usually I don't. At the end of a session, I usually feel great, sometimes even a bit euphoric, like I competed for something and I won. By the next morning, the hangover comes. While all that stuff is processing behind the scenes, I tend to feel pretty emotionally exhausted. I'm a bit more sensitive, I get overwhelmed more easily, I'm tired and a little brain foggy and generally not very social. For this reason, we avoid EMDR right before any important events or social gatherings like family holidays.

Overall, EMDR has significantly improved my response to certain triggers. Some things that used to send me into a panic, now just make me feel uncomfortable. I did have to stop EMDR for awhile though because I went into a deep depression, and both my therapist and I agreed that I wasn't emotionally stable enough to handle it. I'm better now and I will probably start back with EMDR once face-to-face sessions resume. (It can be done over teletherapy, but I'd feel safer with my therapist at my side.) I can't honestly say I'm looking forward to it, because I hate EMDR... but I love what it does for me. 

People respond differently, and have different opinions, but I personally believe that keeping an open mind is the best approach. And as the first commenter noted, having a support system in place is important. I hope you give it a try and that it helps you as much as it's helped me. Just remember that healing takes time and don't try to rush it"
EMDR,fmiy0zu,t1_fmi8de0,1586119197.0,"I second this. EMDR always gives me a sort of ""emotional hangover"" for a few days afterward, and I tend to need a little extra self-care, as well as external support during that time. I had to stop EMDR when I became deeply depressed (for unrelated reasons) because it was too much for me to handle in that state. EMDR can be tough. A support system is important."
AskALiberal,fmfpfdf,t1_fmfn0ik,1586032104.0,"Thank you, and yes I absolutely believe safety and power are *major* influencers. Take bullies, for example. Statistically speaking, they're very often abuse victims themselves. They can't make the abusive parent answer for the abuse, so they take all that hurt and anger and project it onto someone else. Politically speaking, I see it in arguments between parties all the time. Someone posts a meme about any politician, and you will inevitably see personal attacks in the comments. Attacks on the person who posted the meme, who is probably a total stranger. Attacks on politicians (past & present) who have nothing to do with the meme. Attacks on entire parties and groups of people. Attacks on other commenters. We feel powerless to correct the injustice we perceive in our own government, so we project that anger in the form of personal attacks on random strangers. The politician has too much power, but we can take out our anger on his/her supporters. It's a horrible cycle, it happens on both sides, and it's only preventing productive conversation and driving us further apart.

That said, this whole post feels the opposite. Thank you for that."
AskALiberal,fmfmqjg,t1_fmfktar,1586030508.0,"I think it's projected onto people who we *identify* with our triggers (can be PTSD triggers, shame triggers, etc) more often than we realize. For example, a lot of LGBT+ people have anger towards religious people because they identify them as being part of the same religious group who caused them harm in the past. It's a defense mechanism, much in the same way you would want to avoid all bears after previously having been attacked by a bear. At least, this is how I see it as someone with PTSD who has done a lot of trauma work. When it comes to trauma, the brain sometimes doesn't know the difference between a false alarm and a true threat, so it reacts to the false alarm in the exact same way it would react to a true threat. I view this form of misplaced anger in the same way: people reacting to the triggering person/group/issue as if it were the true threat, without their brain realizing there is a difference.

ETA: I think we are all guilty of this to varying degrees, myself included. It's part of our wiring and something that I personally believe if acknowledged, could be improved."
AskALiberal,fmfhqwb,t3_fuxw3s,1586027497.0,">1. In your personal life, how do you feel about when you are angry

First I feel guilty for feeling angry. Then I pause to practice mindfulness and allow both emotions to pass through me and try to figure out where they came from 

>2. In your personal life, how do you tend to feel about when people are angry with you?

Afraid 

>3. In your political life, how do you feel when you are others who agree with you are angry?

Angry with the other side? My heart aches for them, realizing that they are so often angry because they're being triggered by the same thing/people/group that traumatized them, and they sometimes don't even realize it

>4. Politically, how do you feel about people who don’t agree with you getting angry?

I wish they were able to understand my side, but I know that anger is an emotion that shorts out logic, so healthy debate is useless and it's best to end the conversation at that point. I'm curious to know the source of their anger, but they usually won't talk about it because they already see me as an enemy.

I'm no expert, but I do a lot of research on human emotions, both as a hobby and for self awareness and improvement. Anger is a universal emotion that always has a source, no matter which side of the political fence you sit on. For most of us, that source usually boils down to things like fear, hurt, and/or shame. If you can remember that your ""opponent"" carries around these same emotions you do (maybe from different sources and for different reasons, but it *feels* the same) then it's easier to have compassion for them and not hate them or return their anger with more negativity. I wish we could all get better at practicing compassion for others, and for ourselves."
hsp,fmcw02p,t3_fu9ra8,1585953942.0,"I'm in the process of learning how to deal with this now. I've been reading 'Radical Acceptance' by Tara Brach (recommended by my therapist) and listening to some of her talks on mindfulness. It all seemed kind of ""out there"" at first, but it's actually rooted in science. Learning mindfulness basically helps you learn to switch on your prefrontal cortex (the logical part of your brain) and calm your limbic system (the emotional part) so you can better control your reactions. That's sort of an over-simplified explanation, and it takes a lot of practice, but it works. I recommend looking into it. It's especially helpful for hsp"
Marriage,flx4gb9,t1_flwwcja,1585574865.0,"Ask your wife when she would prefer to have sex if not at bedtime. It might seem like an ideal time to you, but maybe not to her. I have a high sex drive, but when it's time for me to sleep, it's time for me to sleep. I do a lot to prepare my mind and body to shut down for the night and 1) that mindset is not good for sex and 2) sex messes up all the work I did to get there.

It's like it has to be in almost every show and it's just so over-done and generally extremely poorly done and it can pop up pretty unexpectedly and it's often very triggering. I hate it so much and I thank you for bringing it up so I can see that it's not just me who feels this way
EMDR,flir7a3,t3_fp1mth,1585188777.0,"A lot of people get images but I generally don't. I get feelings, mostly in my body, and I tend to focus on those. A lot of stuff in my chest usually and sometimes my hands go numb. Sometimes it's very subtle, sometimes it can get a little overwhelming (and my therapist helps me deal with that). It can be different for everybody too, so don't worry about what you're *supposed to* feel because it varies a lot. You actually have to let go of expectations in order to really be open to whatever comes. EMDR is a weird and wonderful thing, and it's not for everybody (or anytime- I'm on an extended break now). I have a love-hate relationship with it myself, but it really has helped me a lot."

povertyfinance,flhq0q0,t1_flgzv5t,1585167349.0,"Insurance reps are wrong about a lot of shit a lot of the time. I work in oral surgery and share an office with the insurance coordinator. She gets incorrect information from those reps EVERY SINGLE DAY. Sometimes she's like ""eh, that doesn't seem right"" so she'll call right back, get a different rep and a totally different answer to the exact same question. Preauthorizations tend to go the same way. Denied for bullshit reasons, we appeal with a note that they processed it wrong, and (sometimes after multiple attempts) they will process it correctly. Part of me thinks they do it intentionally to avoid or delay paying claims, the other part of me thinks they're just the stupidest people on earth and have no idea what they're doing. 

My advice? Try again. Call the insurance company, ask for a supervisor. When the supervisor picks up, make sure it's a supervisor (because sometimes the rep will say ""ok I'll get you a supervisor"" and then just put you back in the regular call queue.) Tell them what's going on and ask why a standard procedure ordered by your doctor is not being covered by your policy. Make them explain the exclusion to you, if it exists. Some can even do a 3-way call with the provider if necessary to discuss why it is being billed a certain way. I've been on those calls as both a patient and as a provider('s office), and it has worked well in most cases for me and for my patients. It's a huge headache to be honest, but well worth the $10k if it works.

Pro-tip: Get the name of every rep you speak to, note the date and time of every conversation, and always ask for a reference number for every call"

mentalhealth,fld1k5b,t3_fnylu3,1585054064.0,"Repressing your feelings doesn't make them go away. It just hides them somewhere inside you where they gnaw at you until you deal with them. I tried repression for most of my adult life. Like you, I used work to cope by distraction. Something I learned: it doesn't work long term. Trauma is stored in the body and you're carrying it around whether you acknowledge it or not. And you have to deal with it if you ever hope to recover from it. Get yourself a therapist and commit to doing the work. I'll be honest, it's hard. And it will take longer than you want it to. But you can heal. And you'll have to heal if you want to move forward with your life. It is so, so worth it."
AskAnAmerican,flaq01v,t3_fnm4q4,1584988801.0,"Sometimes.

Now that I'm grown, I usually just go up for funerals, and I might fly or drive, depending on where I'm coming from, how much time off work I can get, and how much spare cash I have to spend. I don't mind the drive much, but it does take a whole day (16hrs plus traffic and stops) each way vs just a couple hours if you fly.

Exactly this. My friends live in a rural area just outside of a city and they have to use a spotty mobile hotspot for internet. They asked comcast how they could get lines run to their house.
