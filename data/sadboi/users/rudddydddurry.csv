TrueOffMyChest,fi6i2tb,t3_f6dh33,1582195907.0,"I think both yes and no. It's almost impossible to tell someone has depression just from what they look like, or what they said in one conversation. I suffer from both depression and anxiety, and my view on it is, I want to tell people, I try and make myself talk about it when the appropriate situation arises. I do this because the more I talk about it with people, the more I force myself to, the easier it is for me to really open up to my closer friends and family. I think talking more about it is also important because it normalizes it for a lot of people who have never come in contact with it. I like to think that if someone else with depression was to hear me openly talking about my depression, they would maybe find it easier themselves, or at least seem more common, less taboo.
I live in NZ and here the culture surrounding mental health has been, men dont cry, dont show emotions, if you have personal problems, keep it to yourself. 
Only over the last few years has funding began to rise for the mental health sector. But for a lot of the older generation, i think its definitely still a taboo subject.
So I completely agree with your point, however I dont think you should assume that someone talking openly about it is just using it as an excuse, as I worry about this perception all the time."

The OP is clearly being a great support for her bf and trying her best to understand it and as someone with depression, that's all you can ask for. It's so hard to open up to people and tell them your problems because you keep telling yourself that you're just a burden on others. So to have someone by your side, reassuring you that you're not a burden AND also giving you space when you need it, is the dream a lot of people with depression including myself feel like they wont have. To the OP, keep doing what you're doing, you sound like an amazing support force to be by your bf's side."
