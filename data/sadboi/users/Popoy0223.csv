dating_advice,etbsz67,t3_caxomv,1562660525.0,"For any context, my notable past relationships went like this---

-Not a relationship really, but a mutual feeling toward each other was agreed on, I was told they weren't ready for a relationship, and I was okay with that. 2 weeks later I found out he'd gotten a girlfriend after talking to me. Sucked a lot, but okay. I'm not really saddened by it anymore.

-We were going to start bein together and such in a month or 2 or something. We weren't together, but same thing. Mutual feelings agreed on. We talked and hung out when we were around each other and all that. All of the sudden I find out he went to homecoming with another girl. I confront him, he says he thinks we aren't going to work and that's that. Shit hurt a lot, but we're cool now.

-This one's a doozy.(?) This relationship lasted about 6ish months? He started it off by telling me he was still in love with his ex. Left for vacation over Christmas, came back in January and we got together and I gave him a shit ton of presents. He later told me he didn't love me anymore. No reason, just an ""I dunno"". That happens yeah, but there was no remorse. Just eh. We end it, and got back together a day or two after (dumb, right?). A month of that, no love just nothing really. Prioritizing other people (his ex and other girls) which I didn't really have a big problem with at the time. Only texting me for a few minutes a day late at night when I'd stay up waiting for me to text when he'd be active texting, you know who, the ex. He ended uo breaking it off and I ended up with my current guy who blows him out of the water."
dating_advice,etbsy6w,t1_etbs0jt,1562660485.0,"I'm aware that that's really controlling and I hate it :( I feel terrible for it and I want to fix it.

I'm pretty insecure with myself. Sometimes the ""I love you""s and the ""You're so pretty""s feel like they're fake. I've always had a thing with compliments and people not really meaning them. There's always been a lingering thing in the back of my mind that tells me there's no way he actually loves or cares about me. That thing makes the small things feel like proof that he doesn't, when they're normal things people do.

There have been times where he's done something and I've asked for him not to and explained why it hurt. He would agree not to but I'd see him keep doing that and then get upset when I got upset with him for not sticking with what he said. This happened both with girls and other things.

It just feels like everyone is so nice and pretty and mature and I dunno, ""womanly"", that I just feel totally inferior comparitively. I'm scared of being out of the loop and not knowing, eventually finding out. I'm scared of someone making a move on him and him not stopping it. Him making a move on them or developing feelings for someone else and not being happy with me anymore. 

He's just the person that's made me the happiest I've ever been, relationship or not, and thinking about the possibility of having him slip through my fingers to someone else gets me to the point where I wonder if I should even be in a relationship if it makes me that sad to think about something that hasn't even happened.

I've talked to him about it and he just doesn't get it. He says that he wouldn't be with me if he didn't love me, he wouldn't spend time with me if he didn't love me, and he isn't looking to be with anyone else. It's so hard for me to accept that and I don't know why. I just don't trust everyone else. I don't trust him, for some reason.

I'm gonna post what my other relationships were like in the comments if you're interested :)"

Mental_Help,etbkc2x,t1_etaref6,1562649823.0,"It is really easy to be sad and not do anything about it, you're definitely right. I've been putting effort into things recently, apologizing to some of the people I've treated poorly, even if they've not treated me great in the first place. I've been trying to talk things out in a better way with my guy, not being so forceful and trying to make the arguement more of a discussion than a battle. Things like that help, but it's still difficult to deal with some things. I'm a big crier. I cry a damn lot. It's embarrassing to cry over things that shouldn't really be cried over, but it just helps to not go off and say things I don't mean or haven't thought over and all in all it's just some stress trying to melt away sometimes, even if it will never permanently help. But yeah, reading what you said did bring some new things to the table for me to think about and consider when trying to make things better, thank you :)"
HollowKnight,etavfth,t3_ca08dy,1562630206.0,"I don't really have a right to choose yet as I haven't finished the game, but I absolutely LOVE Hornet. Both of her fights took me a few tries, the first like 3 or 4 and the second had a total of 12. I saw something about Hollow Knight about a month before I noticed it was on game pass. When I saw that the game with the two little characters I'd loved the look of enough to trace onto a piece of paper and remember, I was so so happy. Her voice and both fights are challenging but feel amazing to fight.

Someone mentioned that it feels like an actual battle between two players in the Kingdom's Edge version, and after fighting her over and over again, I can agree. It's a challenge, but I loved it and can't wait to see more of her with the rest of my play-through :)

I'm stuck on the traitor lord right now though :/"
