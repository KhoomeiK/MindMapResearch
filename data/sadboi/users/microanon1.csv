For the first time ever, I found a city to call home and that felt like home about 8 yrs ago.  1.5years ago, I got lost in my depression,  and left that home behind.  For the last 1.5yrs I've felt like leaving there was the biggest mistake of my life.  Now I'm stuck in depression and living here because I cant uproot my family again..."

We have a good couple of months, things get bad, then we sweep it under the rug.  This first started when we first started dating 12yrs ago.  Now with 12 years of undealt with issues , things are a mess.  
My wife is emotionally and physically void from the marriage.  I'm battling my own fight with depression.  
We are at a breaking point, and if things dont get better,  we will not make it much farther."
