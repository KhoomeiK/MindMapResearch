Pets,ezv7lbs,t3_d2h011,1568169312.0,"My cat does the same. What helped was breaking up her full amount of food into several feedings. For example, she eats 2/3 cup a day and I just break it up into four feedings. I have an automatic feeder and I feed her Nutro brand. As for the plastic, I just really try to keep it out of her access."
BPD,eyl197e,t1_eykox1x,1567173721.0,"I do go to therapy and take medication, since there are other symptoms to deal with. But, these mechanisms help outside of therapy. Although, I‚Äôve been in therapy since I was 13. I‚Äôm 24 now and many of my symptoms are mild if not diminished."
BPD,eyieqpf,t1_eyicpd3,1567101458.0,"I don‚Äôt really experience the tunnel vision so much. With me, it‚Äôs just so normal at this point that I just try to do something until it passes, like coloring, drawing, playing a game or with my dogs, or even cleaning. I don‚Äôt talk about it every time it happens, but when I do need help, it‚Äôs great for my boyfriend to just sit with me and talk about anything. It‚Äôs really helpful most of the time for him to just tell me I‚Äôm okay and that I‚Äôm real and ask if I want to do something together or get out of the house."
BPD,eyibxal,t3_cwyn7w,1567100272.0,"If you can‚Äôt do the drawing, try holding ice where you usually cut. It stings and can satisfy the craving to hurt, without actually harming yourself. It helped me stop."
BPD,eyi9z3b,t1_eyg86b2,1567099549.0,"I second the lamotrigine (lamictal)! I take that along with buspar. They really help me. I‚Äôd tried tons of meds before that, they either didn‚Äôt work or some of them, like antidepressants, made things worse."
BPD,eyi8pod,t3_cx3aut,1567099023.0,"Yes, these are things I experience often. I forget things very easily and to be completely honest, I experience dissociation so often that I barely think anything of it at this point and just wait for it to pass."
BorderlinePDisorder,ey6xeej,t3_cvqy2k,1566866173.0,"I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist, after previously being misdiagnosed by other mental health professionals. I‚Äôm in the U.S. though, so I‚Äôm not sure how the referrals work there."
