With other stuff you have to start somewhere. Rebuilding yourself is a long process of a thousand tiny steps. Getting some kind of job and starting learning something would be a good beginning. Also, standard stuff like therapy and medication. Although I might be speaking from a privileged position since basic psychiatric care is free (tax-funded) in my country.

ChernobylTV,fiun1ao,t3_f9wjso,1582744514.0,"I have always been intrigued by events which had profoundly shaken humanity and somehow questioned who we really are, what we do and what we think. Which left some trauma in the collective unconscious. The French Revolution, the meatgrinder at Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima, 9/11, the Columbine shooting, or Chernobyl.

The last one has something almost unreal to it. Never before had such an environmental disaster occured. People forced to leave their homes because of something they could not see, touch, smell or feel in any way, other than as consequences of radiation sickness. Like an invisible evil spirit, a creation of man's hands that could bring an end to him.

Second reason is my fascination with old, derelict and abandoned places which were once bustling with life. I love the aesthetics (and the post-apocalypse in general as well). There is a word in English, ""kenopsia"" which describes the eerie feeling brought by being in such a place.  Also, it's as if time stood still. Things left as they were, untouched. It makes you think about how ephemeral our lives are in the great passage of time, and that we ourselves are just passers-by in this world.

I first heard about Chernobyl as a kid, but didn't pay that much attention to it. I remember my parents talking about how the Soviets tried to cover up the whole thing as they used to do and how they as kids had to drink the awful Lugol's iodine to prevent thyroid cancer (I'm from Poland).

Then in adolescence I played the famous S.T.A.L.K.E.R video game, read the ""Roadside Picnic"", saw Tarkowskis ""Stalker"", played the two other games and then started researching more. I looked at the maps and realized that the power plant actually was near Pripyat and not the town of Chernobyl. More insights followed and I eventually amassed an almost unhealthy amount of knowledge about the accident and the exclusion zone itself. I also read the ""Chernobyl Prayer: A Chronicle of the Future"" by Svetlana Alexievich (great book, would recommend). I was very excited when I heard about the show and later was glad that the HBO did the job so well.

Now I'm planning my first trip ever to the Exclusion Zone, which I've always wanted to do."

ForeverAlone,fii2c55,t3_f7xj57,1582416550.0,"I had a blog where I once wrote ""an article"" (more like my personal thoughts) about some school shooting - it got some views (I'm not from the USA btw, former Soviet bloc actually). I also wrote there about my FAness, my shitty life etc. Eventually she made a comment under one of my posts and via her profile I found that she also had a blog where she posted enigmatic and a bit edgy entries about her life. At one point we exchanged e-mails. Once she send me a lenghty e-mail confessing that she had a a crush on me. I was pleasantly surprised but the feeling was not reciprocitated. But then after exchanging some more messages something clicked and I started crushing on her too (weird I know, but I was really lonely at that time). We met and I had my first kiss. We were both convinced that we'd found each other's SOULMATE (oh boy how I was wrong).

She lived 500 kms away from me so then we started seeing each other in a city that was half-way beetwen our cities, to make it easier for both of us. I was a college dropout at the time and broke af so I started doing shitty part time jobs to afford train tickets. We would meet at the train station and then hang out for the entire day and say goodbye in the evening. Eventually I moved to that mid-way city, partly to study for a new BA, partly because I wanted to be closer to her. We lost our virginity to each other in a room that I rented (I was 21 at that time, she was 20). She would visit me on weekends since we were both busy with uni during the week.

It went on for about two years but then she cheated on me back in her city and I was back to being FA. It all feels very weird now, like something that only happens in a movie. It's been almost 4 years since that and I haven't had any further success with women (I'm 26 now, basically an incel, I only attract fat or ugly chicks).
