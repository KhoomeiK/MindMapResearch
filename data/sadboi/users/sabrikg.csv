EDAnonymous,fmzumfx,t3_fycnyd,1586529875.0,"Yeah both of them do, or at least did. Fortunately, I live alone now. My father used to just linger around and stare at what I was cooking without even saying anything, it was awkward as fuck. My mom would give me a disapproving look and say things like “ohhh, are you going to share that?” ( when she was in a “good” mood ), now, when she was cranky she would comment on how I’m using up the ingredients and proceed to whine out loud to whoever was listening. I learned to block them out. I remember that alone kitchen time was greatly appreciated, I really enjoyed it. I almost forgot, my mom also used to diminish my baking abilities; “that looks weird”, “it’s so dry”, “you are taking that to your friends? Great bc I wouldn’t eat it anyways”.

I also love to bake, knowing the amount of butter and sugar that goes into making regular brownies and being able to count the calories on them gave me some sort of power, I obviously didn’t eat any of them. I guess it’s just a coping mechanism. Anyways, as I would bake these indulgent desserts my mom would eat most of it and then proceed to tell me that they weren’t good enough and she only ate them bc she had to. Crazy F***. 

Those are just some stories. I’m pretty sure I got my BPD and disordered eating patterns mostly from her. The worst part is I was really chubby up until Senior year and she’s always been a stick."

I’ll leave this quote from that particular scene

Erica Albright to Mark Zuckerberg: “You are probably going to be a very successful computer person. But you're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true. It'll be because you're an asshole”"

EDAnonymous,fmo2o7w,t3_fwb5fq,1586243177.0,"When the anxiety gets to be too much and I feel the need to fuel my brain with chocolate and other indulgent treats, I usually just give in ( this only happens in times of great stress ), usually when finals come around. What works for me is just repeating in my head that after the exam, all the stress will be gone and I’ll be able to sleep/fast and make up for the overconsumption of calories later. 

It sort of goes like this: “you need to fuel your brain in order to do well on this test. Just eat. After this, its back to your warped sense of normality”

it also helps that my treats are mostly sugar free ( sf chocolate, sf cookies, Coke Zero, sf redbull), I also eat shit tons of trail mix. Yep. CALORIC SHIT.

I end up bloated af and feel like a total pig after my binge/study session but it pays off. I’m back to normal in a few days."
