MakeupAddiction,fr2hhgg,t3_gman4i,1589837364.0,"Believe it or not, I used Elf felt tip pen eyeliner! I saw an older reddit post saying it was a dupe for the Glossier Brow Flick! The top left is how I used to do my brows, but one day I was tired of the “fake” or “instagram” brow look and wanted a more natural, realistic brow look. However, I have very thin and light eye brows, as I practiced and practiced, I started seeing real improvement! The last row is how I do them now :)

Edit: CCW! I am always eager to learn"
