Anxiety,erhz4yc,t3_c14bmv,1560886027.0,Magnesium taurate took away the heart palpitations I'd had for 10+ years.
Anxiety,erhyz2r,t3_c14uzm,1560885931.0,"I had heart palpitations for years, and neither my cardiologists nor myself could figure out the cause. I could be experiencing stress or be perfectly calm and relaxed and it didn't make a difference. I had all of the tests you had - stress test, holter monitor, echo, EKGs, etc, but everything pointed to the problem being in my head. 

That's when I started looking at anxiety symptoms and remedies for those symptoms. I stumbled across magnesium and started taking 250mg/day. My palpitations are pretty much gone. 

I highly recommend magnesium taurate. It will mess with your stomach for a few days, but after that, it's smooth sailing - and hopefully fewer palpitations. Whether or not it will relieve you of other symptoms, I can't say. I never really had any other symptoms other than random feelings of dread. But I'd rather have that than the palpitations!"
