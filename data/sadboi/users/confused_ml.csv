AskMen,fqnie0c,t3_gjtsmd,1589495397.0,"Where do i begin?

Do you want a convinient lie or the harsh truth?

Well, its not exactly the truth but a speculation, maybe youre just unlucky with women, this thing happens, some of us are just too unlucky with certain things in life and no matter how many times we try them, the end result is just the same

However, as a general advice, just write down what do you want in a relationship? What do you want in a woman? Are you hoping for temporary fun, or long term commitment?

Just be honest with the women around you to what you want, do you want a woman who loves a guy who is way too nice to the point of being unable to stand up to himself and is unable to say no to anything? Or do you want an extremely submissive woman who wants her man to dominate her, to control her, tell her what to do and punish her if she fails to carry out his commands? 

Another advice, dont fall too easily in love, you see in romantic stories they'll tell you that love is the most important component in any relationship and that no matter the differences, love will solve everything, sorry but thats just plain fiction that does not work in real life, yes love is good and important but its not the most important thing, compatibility is the most important thing, love dies but compatibility remains, thats why i advise you to not fall in love with the first woman who shows some interest in you, dont just throw yourself into a blind love with a womsn who is not compatible with you and dont want what you want in a relationship then convince yourself that everything will work out as long as love is there, such ideals are sweet but they are too good to be true

If you cant talk to women, go hit the gym and work on your physical attractiveness, they will be talking to you instead which will make things easier

Remember, dont fall in love quickly and dont believe that love never dies"

There are always people you can't piss off, there are always critical opinions you have that will get you in some sort of trouble even in the most democratic nations, you might lose your job, they might make rumors that ruin your reputation and in sone cases they lock you up

There could be times in certain countries where you can say anything about anyone, but such periods are short, humans always revert back to their nature of refusing opposing opinions"

1 its one guy or a small group of soldiers shooting down tens of enemies while the enemy bullets keep missing

2 a small, skinny woman beating hordes of muscular men including men 5 times her size

- in horror movies:

1 the protagonist is scared, he or she knows that she is being stalked by a killer/ghost/monster, but when she hears a noise coming from the closet or behind the door, instead of hiding or calling for help, she or he slowly approaches the source of the sound, without even carrying a weapon for defense

- in movies in general

Interracial relationships: look, im bi-racial myself, a product of an interracial relationship, back in a day whenever i see such relationship in a movie, it felt good because its something you rarely see so it feels special, nowdays, almost every movie have one or more of those interracial couples, it feels fake, forced, dumb and meaningless, if they want to normalize this then i appreciate what are they trying to do, but how about making movies that specifically talk about this topic or having such couples every once in a while instead of just putting bi racial couples in almost everything all of a sudden, it feels stupid and it will backfire, if a bi racial guy like me feels like its stupid and is getting tired of seeing it everywhere, then you can imagine how will the people who are a bit reluctant about such relationships feel, you're not normalizing this thing for them, you're provoking them and making them more angry and of top of that, you call them nazis for not readilly accepting what you're doing in movies, so you turn them from being reluctant into outright refusing that thing, yeah good job normalizing this thing for them

These same cliches infest almost every single action and horror movies"

Here's the thing, im so sick of the ""one man army"" trope where a single or a handful of soldiers are killing enemies by the hundreds, while enemy soldiers cant shoot for shit, thats why i don't ever watch american war movies, im sick of seeing one guy manhandling his opponents like they are nothing.

.

If that wasn't bad enough, now we have the ""one chic army"" a single, small and skinny woman is beating the crap of guys more muscular and larger than her, that is what happened with me and RE movies, as soon as i saw the heroine beating the hell out of three guys in biker suits i said ""that's it, im outta here"""

The closes thing i can think of are two examples: women who have a fetish for misogyny, they constantly talk crap about the female gender and worship men in a sexual ways, but they usually only linger on the internet

The other kind are women who exclusively white knight for men they are with unlike male white knights who kiss up to every single woman they find or even hear about even if they don't know her personally

One example of those female ""white knights"" are the women who date abusive men and defend them furiously even if he hits her, abuses and cheats on her, even if he hits her in public and another guy comes to defend her, she will attack the other guy then leaves with her abusive bf/husband hoping to earn his acknowledgement and love for her"

But, i dont know about the idea that breasts by default have the same sexual value as any other part of a woman's body

If we compare hair to knees for example, hair have more beauty value than knees even though its exposed more often, so maybe some parts are naturally more attractive than others, and off course covering them increases their already higher value

Just my two cents"
