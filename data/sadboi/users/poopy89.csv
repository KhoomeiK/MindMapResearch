BorderlinePDisorder,ey06vll,t3_cuwx48,1566675211.0,Hmmm. If you like animals... I currently work as a dog bather in a grooming salon. It's not too high stress. Some days can be busy though. It's nice not always having to interact with people.

bipolar,ev827td,t1_ev6tnsh,1564267882.0,"Fucking same. I'll keep pushing people with my bullshit. Eventually when I get a reaction, I end up getting hurt from it though. It's so stupid."
bipolar,eucjwg1,t1_euajsxj,1563677221.0,"I turned 25 a couple weeks ago. For me, my birthday just reminds me that another year went by and things still feel and seem so shitty. New Years does it to me too."
bipolar,etniq2t,t3_cchjr4,1562988501.0,"Same. The other night at 12AM, I was like, ""I REALLY want a new tattoo"".. Next day as soon as the nearest tattoo shop opened, I went in and got a tattoo üôÉ"
bipolar,et2u0ph,t1_eszd73w,1562422691.0,:(.. message me. Or someone. It can help to talk to people. Please don't hurt yourself.
bipolar,escdwqy,t3_c6tf5h,1561827267.0,"Yes. I drank about a week ago. This past week, I've been up and down even while taking my meds consistently. I felt hypo for a day, the following day extremely sad, and then the following two days I just felt like I was dissociating... I'm just starting to feel almost at my baseline."
bipolar,es9qwfq,t1_es9joea,1561742466.0,That's good to hear. I'm really glad you're feeling better. Take care of yourself.
bipolar,es7v6cc,t1_es7skx7,1561680721.0,"Loool it's such a struggle.. just feel so what the fuck after pulling shit like this.
Try not to be too hard on yourself though. It's so easy to give ourselves shit but we have to remember that we're not always well :("

bipolar,es7t0df,t3_c6cbi0,1561679020.0,"What you're saying makes sense. I feel this way right now. Coming down from a high mood makes things feel so unreal.
Last night I messaged my boyfriends roommate asking him if he wanted to hookup. And then today I self-harmed...
But yeah, it seems like you need to get some rest. Have you tried guided meditations that are aimed at helping you fall asleep? They've been helpful for me in the past."
bipolar,es7se3r,t3_c64b9y,1561678552.0,Yes. I messaged my boyfriends roommate last night and asked him if he wanted to fuck... Like what ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
bipolar,erd87kc,t1_erc790g,1560733843.0,"Yeah, I agree. It definitely takes a lot of strength to keep going and deal with the bullshit. If you wanna chat OP, feel free to message me"
bipolar,eq9hg9x,t3_bxpoqs,1559906831.0,I think about this a lot too. It blows my mind. Like hooooow??!
bipolar,eq8uo57,t3_bx25re,1559875936.0,"I was on cipralex for a bit and that definitely lowered my sex drive.  I am currently on zoloft and latuda... zoloft hasn't really affected my sex drive but it's affected my ability to finish. I lowered my dose by 25mg and I can finish now, it's just not as enjoyable. 

I think you should  try it out. It's amazing how much the meds have helped. If the side effects become too much, you can always communicate that with your doctor and try another one."
bipolar,eq8tk94,t3_bxirtf,1559875084.0,I've been on Latuda for about 6 months with no issues.
