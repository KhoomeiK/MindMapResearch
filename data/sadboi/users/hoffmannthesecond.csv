BPD,ffzemmq,t3_evun8i,1580375184.0,Yes
BPD,ffzeb88,t3_ew1ib5,1580374730.0,You made it this far. You are a rock star.
BPD,ffzdwd9,t3_evxrd2,1580374154.0,Yes especially the part where you obsess about what everyone else will think about every potential action. I have so many imaginary dramas doing on at any given point as I play out other people's reactions to me in my head - like I am checking with my imaginary version of literally everyone to see if what I'm thinking of doing is going to make them reject me in some way or invalidate me or judge me. Bleh. So you are not alone and I hope you find good help and make progress it can and does get better.
BPD,ffx03qw,t3_evk3m8,1580314871.0,My dad said I was controlling even as an infant. I believe it.
BPD,ffx013u,t3_evmra5,1580314828.0,Yes it is real
BPD,ffwzd51,t3_evntve,1580314412.0,"YESssss big time. It's a HUGE factor for me. Ugh. I get a little alarm on my phone when PMS is coming and I'm like oh fuck here we go.

Lol. God bless you! I hope you get the help you need and deserve and just never give up trying different things because it takes a long time to make little progress sometimes but it's worth it."
BPD,ffwz5wj,t3_evnwol,1580314284.0,Felt this way this morning. Didn't help to know I'd feel different by the afternoon (which I do). Now that I feel ok I try to soak it in for the inevitable flip. With therapy it has gotten better. Never give up. I get so pissed at BPD and feel like suicide is just giving in to what BPD wants. Fuck bpd I'm not ever going to give up. We all die eventually but I'm going out on God's time. I'm sorry you're in pain and hope you are ok or at least a little better by the time you read this (if you do).
BPD,ffwbrp6,t3_evk4c3,1580294328.0,"I also don't know what it would be like NOT to be thrilled every night at the new phase of the moon, every day at the different shapes of the clouds, every change of season because of the new colors in nature, every deer I see, every cute animal...hahha I have kids and I'm right there with them in terms of the way the world is so interested and full of wonder and adventure. 

I feel awful lately, just full of that dread fear and anxiety but DBT is helping and I hope in time to get better enough to imagine a life that I can sustain. Great reminder that there are good things about this God forsaken illness.

Can't say I love it though. Lol! God bless you."
BPD,ffv1uz1,t3_ev8s2s,1580253757.0,"Thank you. I'm glad you have resolved to never give up. I'm so sorry for all of this, I understand and it makes me so sad. Sometimes I wish there weren't so many if these stories out there. I feel like I would rather be the only one than know that out there all over the place there is hurt and hurt and hurt. Just like mine. Ugh.

We all die in the end someday but let's never go down without a fight. Fuck this disorder."
BPD,ffuatjo,t1_fftx5fb,1580238083.0,"Same here I struggle with my conscience all the time...the ultimate thing that will get me choked up is thinking about that passage where Jesus is like ""depart from me I never knew you"" and being crushed by anxiety to please not get rejected by God himself. I think about BPD and religion a lot and how complicated that can get. I have a good priest though who reminds me about mercy which helps and he's really level headed and kind. I can just tell him that I'm freaking out and I often cry from the guilt/fear when something is on my conscience.  He probably thinks I'm a bit crazy but he's really helpful when I need direction."
BPD,ffu987k,t3_ev5upy,1580237142.0,"Everything you said I can relate to. Every. Single. Thing. Haha so funny how we understand each other and no one else understands us and I don't understand other people who aren't bpd. I just feel like a weirdo voyeur when I'm around people just observing them like ""wow isn't that neat I wonder what that's like"" haha yep."
BPD,fftkaf3,t3_ev3f0k,1580222758.0,Yes. I have it as a goal for the year 2020 not to say yes to anything just to practice saying no gracefully. I tend to always overwhelm myself with obligations and I think I feel pretty worthless unless I'm doing 'duties' so I volunteer alot and overbook myself. If someone asks me to do something I almost always say yes. But I do believe in baby steps so this year I pray I can get more rest and recalibrate to learn a good baseline so I can know my limits and stay in them. I hope you find a way to practice boundaries with this too. Baby steps!!! God bless you!
BPD,ffs2ome,t1_ffrz71y,1580171654.0,Thank you for the gentle but no BS way you laid this out.
BPD,ffs2eyt,t3_eutls9,1580171466.0,Glad you are doing something positive with reddit instead of negative.  Keep with it.
BPD,ffs26bx,t1_ffrxnti,1580171300.0,Yup lol
BPDrecovery,ffrx3ep,t3_euuzlm,1580167848.0,Yes. It's helping me a lot already. Was also diagnosed when I was maybe 19 but only now for the past year or so working very slowly with a good DBT therapist. It's incredible God bless you so glad you are getting the help we all need and so glad DBT exists.
BPD,ffrwxj5,t1_ffrwrex,1580167739.0,"Haha freaking out because i put just ""yeah"" what if the person thinks I'm being sarcastic or rude, I didn't mean to be mean also freak out about saying love you too because that's weird. I hate being like this but it's pretty comical. 

So for the record that yeah was a supportive yeah."
BPD,ffrwrex,t3_euuwob,1580167626.0,Yeah
BPD,ffquniw,t3_eun3et,1580144032.0,"Had it the opposite when in my 20s couldn't stand being inside my apartment. Would do anything to try to tire myself out enough to be able to go back there and sleep. Many hours driving pointlessly in circles on the interstate at night. Hated that feeling.

God bless you I hope you do find the skills that work for you. Right now my best skills are the deep breathing and mindfulness skills which help me get past crippling anxiety that I get every morning. It helps and once I get going I do ok for the most part."
BPD,ffns0r1,t3_euab43,1580069994.0,"I'm all the time confused too.  Was married to a porn/sex addict it took me many years to even get it straight in my head that I didn't deserve it. All because he was generally nice to me and we get along great. Lol. Also the fact that I was basically pre-rejected from the start took away a lot of the anxiety that usually comes from not believing a person could like me for long. Also he was legit narcissist so it was like all the worst fears of rejection and degradation were realized so it was somehow calming. Ugh. Now that we're divorced I am more screwed up emotionally than I was because of being alone. In any given day I'll go from super happy to anguish/despair. Sorry you're hurting though. It's so lame having this disorder. I cried this morning before church because I wake up every morning in dread despair and anxiety. Lol.  I feel like an unperson and it's so exhausting. I wish we all could be just cured. My therapist has helped me a lot and I am getting to where I have enough skills to not do anything too self destructive. Would be nice to have something better to look forward to than just barley being able to exist. Um. You are special and very tough, very resilient and very much gifted as all of us are who survive this ridiculous and absurd illness. There is a good and special person that endures through all the ups and downs. I hope you'll feel better soon and when you do that you get rest and comfort to store up against the hard times. God bless you."
BPD,ffh3f9v,t3_etbc5y,1579922047.0,Yes
