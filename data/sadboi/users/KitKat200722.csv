genderfluid,fpbx62c,t3_gca56d,1588481073.0,Thor is the most excepting bitch I’ve ever seen! This is probably because of the amounts of times he wears a dress. But for real if any of them should be a gender icon it should be Thor because in the Myths he’s dressed up in a dress and crap (usually to sneakily kick ass but still). He’s still the most excepting butch I’ve ever seen! (Sorry the cussing and paragraph)
vet,fpbwrnk,t1_fp4q3y4,1588480770.0,Ok! Is it too late for ASAP? Because she hasn’t shown any signs of being in pain or anything and the thing has gone away so does she still need emergency care or does she seem fine? And third eyelid?

OriginalCharacters,fo8qrex,t3_g64wvs,1587601915.0,Fun thing! In my opinion I find it obnoxious when people name a character after a color and make that character the same color as their name literally everywhere. So if I were coloring her I would use a normal amount of purple like not an EVERYTHING IS PURPLE ALL TGE TIME but more of an I have like three purple outfits because I like the color not because it’s my name. But that’s just me you do whatever you want she’s not my character and you are great at arting

Christianity,fmubvtr,t1_fmubq8w,1586388366.0,Yeah must have
Christianity,fmubu9m,t1_fmuarko,1586388342.0,"1. I knew it was multiple books but I didn’t know there were 66, and another thing that I commonly find my mind asking is “did the author of the first book ever think or realize that this would become so (in lack of better words) popular?) 

2. I’m glad to know that this place doesn’t have many homophobic peoples! And I completely understand where you are coming from! 


Thank you for the help honestly! I wish you the best!"
Christianity,fmub3vo,t1_fmuavpc,1586387938.0,This was truly beautiful and poetic.
Christianity,fmuayln,t1_fmu8ro2,1586387858.0,"Ok. 1.sorry I didn’t know it wasn’t free and yeah people made an entire petition to get Good Omens removed from Netflix (it was never on Netflix) so yeah a lot of people didn’t like it

2. Yeah many people were raised to think that it’s bad and I’ve had teacher Denys being gay and say something like “that’s a sin and you’re such a nice girl) or something but they said it in a nice way the girl on my bus commonly talks about other things considered sin and the way she says it to me is clearly meant to offend or insult me so I was focusing more on people like her saying that I’m going to hell and that being gay is a sin as a way to be mean instead of people like my teacher who honestly believe that being gay is a sin and just wanted to let me know

3.cool! Happy it’s not pride yet (I say this as a good thing not a me trying to be mean thing)

4.i already touched on the stuff in the fourth paragraph 

5. A lot of people were just raised to think that being gay is just terrible which is why I was asking this because I just wanted to know if the people here think of being gay as just terrible because I like to know my peoples 

6. Yes because “that’s a sin” is just like  Thanos, it is inevitable

7. Yeah shortly after I posted this I scrolled through this sub Reddit a little and only saw wholesome questions and well people talking about Christianity (I hope I spelled that right)

Ok! I’ve answered all the paragraphs! 

Thank you for this it honestly helped a lot more then I made it seem I’m sorry if my answers seemed snarky or rude! I wish you the best! Have a great day!"

asktransgender,fmrkz4n,t3_fwm7cu,1586326437.0,"Ok here’s what I can tell ya (just know I’m not at all experienced in this).

1. Remembers she is a girl she feels like a girl she acts like a girl she looks like a girl she talks like a girl SHE IS A GIRL all the same apply to you being a boy.

2. Just ask because you never know she might want to wait till marriage she might want to give things more time you know stuff, so while we are all still quarantined just call her and ask when all this covid mess is over if she might want to do the sex thing, and while in that conversation if she says yes then talk about it ask if she’s comfortable with the down their pair and if she’s not then maybe she’ll make you wait till she completely transitioned before doing the whole sex thing

3. Lastly just do what you’d normally do, she’s hardly any different then other girls so yeah!


Remember I know nothing about what I’m talking about so don’t listen to what I’ve said. Congratulations on the nice lady! Buy eggs and toilet paper!"
