Both have cream as part of the sauce. The pork version includes brandy. The beef version has bourbon and white port wine. I also make a different version of the green peppercorn beef steak without cream. That has red currant jelly and red wine, and of course all include other staple ingredients, as well. You have to be a peppercorn fan, but if you are, they're all wonderful! I love pepper! 

If you like any of these ideas let me know. The pork loin version is originally in French. The cream-version beef is in Czech with a bad translation. I could clarify a few things. The red currant jelly/red wine version is at:

Cooking,fr10w68,t3_gloe7o,1589811059.0,"My husband is allergic to garlic, so I never use it and my food is delicious. I use various herbs and/or spices (and vegetable aromatics, etc) that accent the dishes. Luckily my husband isn't allergic to other alliums (i.e. onions). This garlic allergy is only a challenge when we eat out or want pre-made foods from the grocery store. I don't miss it in my cooking because almost no one in my family regularly used garlic in the past. I also love the herbs and/or spices I use in its stead. Many recipes barely even call for herbs/spices because garlic has become considered THE main flavoring by many people. Almost as important as salt. I believe some people even overuse it. I can't help but to almost feel a bit sad that such people miss out on other flavors, that are easily masked by the extreme pungency of overused garlic.

Obviously, there are people that use it so much that they stop realizing the pungency. Since I rarely eat it, but am not personally allergic to it, that is quite clear to me. Recently I ordered a slice of white pizza with arugula, prosciutto, tomato, and mozzarella at a pizzeria and it had so much garlic on it that I felt like ""Have a little pizza with your garlic."" I happen to make the same pizza without garlic, using fresh rosemary in the ricotta. I enjoy the flavors of the rosemary and all of the other ingredients, including extra virgin olive oil, which I buy high-quality of. They are delicious!

Like you, OP, I do like garlic, but I like it where it belongs and to the degree that is appropriate. Garlic bread and garlic soup, and a nice garlicky marinara sauce? Delicious. Many other dishes? Really, I wonder why in the heck it's there.

* 1/4 tsp dried oregano or marjoram
* 1/2 cup chopped lean ham or Canadian bacon, or additional cooked vegetables 
* 4-8 eggs, poached, sunny side up, or fried as you like 

Add  lentils to a medium pot with broth, onion, bay leaf, green pepper, and salt. Bring to a boil and simmer, covered, for 20 mins.  Add  herbs and chopped ham (or additional vegetables) to the pot and simmer  5-10 minutes more, or until lentils are tender, but not mushy.

Sometimes a person with bipolar type 1 can just have a hypomanic episode and then return to stable or become depressed. Other times they go through a hypomanic phase en route to a full blown manic episode. Of course some people can go from baseline to full blown manic rapidly, but that's not necessarily a norm. The only requirement for bipolar type 1 is that at some point you experience a full blown mania.

BipolarReddit,fp67tk9,t3_gb9219,1588347633.0,"I am not familiar with the means of looking up online therapists, but most of us even who seek face-to-face therapy need to screen for bipolar experts. My suggestion is to not only ask if they specialize in working with bipolar disorder, but to also ask the approximate number of people they've treated with bipolar disorder. You may also want to ask what their approach has been in helping those with bp. Their years of experience treating those with bp. Ask about successes with patients with bp. Etc.

I'm not sure it makes a huge difference whether they've treated clients with bp1 vs. bp2. And certainly if your bp2 leans on the depressive side, their experience with that is also crucial.

One of the times I was looking for a new therapist I discovered that some really only focus on non-mental illness counseling (i.e. marital counseling, self-esteem issues, adjustment issues, quasi life coaching, and similar). One therapist I saw even rejected me at the end of our first meeting because she said she'd need ""a team"" to handle me as a patient. It's good to weed out such therapists quickly.

You know, it's possible that some therapists that have only ever offered face-to-face sessions may start to offer online therapy, in the future. The covid 19 pandemic has forced a great number of such therapists to try it. My own psychiatrist (a man over 70) would never have considered such a thing, but this week he said he might even offer it to me, briefly, after I relocate to Europe in the near future. As a transitional support for a few months. This is just something to keep in mind. Obviously, therapists don't have the medication bit to worry about."

I'm sorry it seems hurtful to you, but I'm going to be frank and say that you should take the feedback with some level of gratitude and work to lower the volume, whether it be by calming hypomania/mania or just plain breaking the bad habit. Or both.

What if you found someone very disrespectful and you told them that? Should they feel hurt, if they were, indeed, disrespectful of you and others? Some people don't even provide such feedback, and instead, stop talking to the person or even talk about them behind their backs, or be mean in return. It could even affect a person's ability to be promoted at a job, in some cases. Having ones attention drawn to a universally annoying behavior is often a gift. As I wrote, one to even be grateful for, in many circumstances.

I've read that we don't always hear our own speaking volume as well as others do. Certainly adding some impulsivity and lack of insight from hypomania/mania doesn't help. And though I can't speak for you or others on this, I can say that the energy, possible anxiety/irritability/excitement/agitation can tend to cause me to ""pull from the gut"" when talking.

Cooking,foruucn,t3_g8zpm2,1588018907.0,"I own Kosher salt, and have attempted to use it in recipes, but then realized that it is not such a big deal as they seem to make it out to be, for general culinary purposes. I think table salt is usually fine for general purposes, and the iodized kind can be good for the thyroid. Sea salts can sometimes add a very nice element to some foods, particularly as a topping. In my view, better than Kosher salt.

People can downvote me if they like, but the only real benefit I see in Kosher salt over table or sea salt, for home use, is that it's cheap. Perhaps in some cases the crystal size is of benefit (i.e. for using on raw meat), but some sea salts can be just fine...and so can table salt. The amount of salt needed is all a matter of taste and based on experience using it, except maybe for cake (or similar recipes) and they usually assume table salt use. I believe some chefs grab Kosher salt with their hands (from whatever they keep it in nearby) and throw it in certain recipes (amount based on experience). I find my table salt to be more convenient to keep close at hand. I know that table salt is stronger in saltiness than the same amount of Kosher salt. So, I know to use less.

Since it's cheap, I tend to use my huge box of Kosher salt more for topping the ice for my ice cream machine. I rarely make rolls (or pretzels) that would need larger crystal salt, but if I did, I'd likely just use one of my sea salts. As a salt for home use, I see Kosher salt's increased usage as part of a fad...or a cost-savings measure."

One thing that is quite built into my brain is disinhibition. Obviously, sometimes my disinhibition is stronger than other times, but it is always there. Personality? Bipolar disorder? Who knows! For example, I really don't care if people think some of my behavior is odd. I guess I do care more if they think it is aggressive or scary. It was mostly the latter two that made me finally get help, but I have NOT tried to hold myself back from any otherwise odd-ball behavior. I feel stable, and yet I have no qualms about flashing my husband while walking down a grocery store aisle. I am perfectly happy being the ""Star of the Show"" by dancing most enthusiastically...anywhere. I believe that talking to myself in public is perfectly fine. I'll admit that when I'm manic, it gets even more out of control. ""Over the top"" has been a label I've heard directed at me many times over, throughout my life. 

Not every man could tolerate me as a wife, but luckily I do have a husband who does and embraces my eccentricities. He doesn't want me to be very ill, but he is OK with my baseline ways. 

I have plenty of stories of psychotic and EXTREMELY over the top behavior, but no need to go into all of that. I'll say that it actually took a while for me to even recognize that some of that behavior was even very abnormal. It took a while to gain insight. I do agree with you that based on some of what I've read others write on various bipolar forums, some people with the diagnosis are pretty darned tame.

Even if I don't take my Seroquel XR until 1 am or later, I usually feel sick the next day. In those cases, I don't get to sleep until 4 am but still usually wake up by at least 7 am.

My usual sickness from missing my Seroquel XR includes a bad headache, upset stomach, anxiety (or even mixed mood), and sometimes gastro intestinal discomforts. 

I take 650 mg at night and 50 mg in the morning.

I told my psychiatrist about not being able to sleep if I miss my Seroquel XR. He told me that that is because I am so prone to mania. I sort of disagree that that is the full reason.

Our personalities are such (and similar enough) that we understand each other well. Our relationship endures because we love each other without any real judgement.

Along with the personality traits I referred to, I suppose the fact that my husband's father was a psychiatrist maybe helps. My husband understands depression well, himself, and gets a gold star for being very ""imperturbable"".

There was a six year period in my illness that I would call somewhat traumatic. That's when all of my hospitalizations occurred (plus). He saw a lot of scary stuff. Obviously he was quite negatively affected because of that. I have had therapy and psychiatrist since my diagnosis. My husband goes to a psychiatrist and did see a therapist during a rough period.

In my husband's and my case, never having children was surely helpful for us. I'm not saying couples dealing with bipolar disorder shouldn't, but that it was best for my husband and me. I have no regrets about that. Really, neither my husband nor I even like children. Sometimes a pet is more than enough."
BipolarReddit,fo8pprh,t3_g69ywq,1587601318.0,"Impulsive/disinhibited behavior and talking loudly, quickly, and/or aggressively and ""over the top"". Usually with the latter symptoms, either someone who knows me well draws my attention to them, or in the former (and latter) cases, even I may eventually notice. This stuff usually precedes major sleeping issues, since I have a tendency to be sedated well by my rather large dose of Seroquel XR at night, plus Klonopin. Usually, if my mood skyrockets again in the morning, I know something is amiss. Then if I can't sleep many hours, it's really ramping up.

Over the years, I've gained more insight into my hypomanic symptoms. They're usually not subtle! The insight is not always immediate, but being aware and doing regular ""self-checks"" help. If I start to reach full blown manic, there is no insight or stopping myself. I need others to help. I try desperately not to let myself reach that point! When I do, the public notices!

My psychiatrist gives me ""prn"" supplies of regular Seroquel and Ativan. I usually take one of these to curb or extinguish it the upswing. Having prns has prevented many additional hospitalizations. If the prns are not enough or I need too many, there is usually a call to my psychiatrist. He often orders an increase to my base cocktail, in those cases. This setup has only worked well since I found a good medication cocktail, and gained some insight into my illness."
Cooking,fo8lhjx,t1_fo8jy7n,1587598892.0,"Do you like coconut cake? Or if you really love fruit, you could consider making a strawberry (or mixed berry) shortcake. Or a simple yellow, white, or almond cake with either a fruit preserves and whipped cream/cream cheese or butter cream icing/filling, and iced with that same filling/icing, and then topped with fresh berries and even some almonds (or anything else.)

I made the following cake for my father a year ago: [https://www.williams-sonoma.com/m/recipe/almond-scented-white-cake.html](https://www.williams-sonoma.com/m/recipe/almond-scented-white-cake.html) Instead of a four-layer cake, I made it into a three-layer cake (using 3 cake pans instead of 2). That prevented the need for me to halve each layer horizontally, which is often a tricky task. I just reduced the baking time slightly."
Cooking,fo8je8f,t3_g66gxs,1587597710.0,"I hope this doesn't offend, but why don't you first try baking a boxed cake? Yes, that wouldn't be 100% homemade, but it can be a good first step for a new baker. There's still plenty of things to do with a boxed cake (preparing the pans, the oven, mixing the box ingredients with the ones directed on the box, baking, testing for doneness, removing from pan, preparing frosting, decorating). I deliberately listed all of this to show how it would still be plenty of work.

If you really want something from scratch, go for it. You haven't really said what kinds of cake you like, other than not liking intense chocolate ones. Probably the easiest would be a simple vanilla or lemon pound cake, as someone else recommended. 

Do you have a well-stocked pantry and kitchen tools, like a mixer?"
