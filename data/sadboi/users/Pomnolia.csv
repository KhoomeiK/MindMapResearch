If you're sick but not in need or urgent care, you don't get tested but are told to stay home and act as if you have it. So the numbers we see worldwide today are those that have been TESTED. There are so many who probably caught it, but it wasn't severe and didn't get tested.

My mother, who is from Brazil, I can tell you that in the very poverty stricken areas, there are people who aren't even accounted for. Who don't even have birth certificates. We really have no idea of the numbers.

And, for those conspiracy theorists, the Government could be hiding numbers.

Many people go through this and you're not alone. 
I wish you the best of luck. It'll be ok! I believe in you!"

I feel that those who 'over share' are really just in desperate need of talking, so please do it. Find a therapist. Therapy is an amazing thing that everyone should do. It really does help."
rant,fn88mut,t3_fzxzfj,1586736234.0,"The problem I have with this is that, just like people think it's unnecessary to hoard toilet paper, it's unnecessary to hoard so much money that they would never spend in their life time.

I understand that their money was earned through hard work or whatever reason, but why should there be people will millions in their account when there are others that can't even eat? It's 2020, and it's time that people stopped being so selfish.

We all bleed the same colour and we should all be entitled to the bare basics, which we don't all have.

Yes, I would give away money I don't need to others who do.

In NZ so many people have spare money right now due to quarantine and I can't even count on my hands how many are offering that spare money to those who can't buy groceries due to losing their jobs over all of this. It's a beautiful thing to see. They could just put that money in savings, as it's a great opportunity to save right now for those who still have jobs! I myself had left over money as I'm not spending much during the month because everything is closed. I could've put it in my savings, but I used it to buy someone else groceries.

The unity in NZ is like nothing else I've seen in the world, and I've lived in South America, UK and Australia. The world needs to be more selfless. You don't take your money with you when you die."
rant,fn87p0f,t3_g04fw1,1586735671.0,"Oh man, I'm so sorry. My boyfriend has hit someone's cat once (it died straight away) and he said it was the hardest thing to do to go to the persons house and let them know. 

If I hit someone's pet I would just feel absolutely terrible, regardless of it being my fault or not.

My cats have never left the house (mind you, I was living in Brazil at the time and people over there actually purposely feed cats led so they die, so no one really lets their cats out) and I don't think I would ever let my cat out even now living in NZ. I think I would aim to get a more of an indoor cat, though. I can imagine how stressed an outdoor cat would get if it was forced to stay indoors."

Weird analogy, but here we go- it's like someone who takes pictures of the house they cleaned to prove they cleaned it. If something has been cleaned, you don't need pictures to prove it. You'll just see that it's clean. (been watching too much Kitchen Nightmares during lockdown. Those that know, will know)

If he really didn't care, he wouldn't need to make a video proving he didn't care."
rant,fn66dmc,t1_fn5ijfm,1586689211.0,"I think about that aswell. Here in NZ the amount of people recovering is greater than those being infected. Lockdown is due to end on the 23rd. It'll take one person who's infected to start it all over again. Then what? I'm very grateful that both myself and my fiancee are essential workers because I have absolutely no idea what we'd do otherwise. I can't even imagine the stress that those who have lost their jobs and have no income are facing. 
It's just a total mess! This is why I get so upset when I see kiwis not following lockdown rules. We're so lucky to have someone like Jacinda, and people are just not paying attention to her rules.
I have family both in the UK and Brazil, and the leaders over there are just totally useless. Especially in Brazil. 

I genuinely can't even picture a normal life anymore. At least not soon enough."
