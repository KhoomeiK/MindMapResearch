Yes, benzos shouldn’t be taken long-term but the reality is that some people need it. My anxiety makes me miss work and school, not sleep, fight with people, and am just crippled. I was having constant panic attacks. I also have bipolar disorder so I can’t take SSRIs which would normally treat my anxiety and panic. In terms of keeping tolerance low, if you don’t abuse it won’t develop. Yes though, you most likely have to occasionally go up and down on your dose ñ."

I feel like I’ve felt the range of humanity and what it means to exist, suffer, and recover. Yes, it fucking sucks a shit ton, treatment is a pain in the ass, and it is heavily stigmatized, but it is the lens through which I have learned to see the world.

Also, as a therapist in training it makes it more capable of understanding the emotional experiences of my clients. I can understand what it is like when a mental health condition gets in the way of living. I know what it’s like to be manic, depressed, anxious, addicted, psychotic, etc. I have developed an insight into the mind and behavior that few people who are not bipolar have."
