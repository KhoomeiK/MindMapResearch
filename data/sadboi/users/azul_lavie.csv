ADHD,fn7pae7,t3_g02wkr,1586724892.0,"I‚Äòm a girl with ADHD. But my parents didn‚Äôt believe it, and they were completely against stimulant medication, so I went unmedicated for 18 years of my life (I‚Äôm 18 turning 19 now and I finally have medication).
Shit‚Äôs rough. For me, ADHD is absolutely debilitating. I knew for a long time I had it even without being diagnosed. I had a couple of guy friends who had ADHD and their‚Äôs was much more obvious. I was a girl with ADHD who seemed to hold up fine in the regular school curriculum, it was less obvious at first. My hyperactivity was mostly suppressed with my depression (yes I have depression too). But it all came crashing down later.

When I was a kid (like three years old) I would get up from the carpet and just start running around. My teachers were like ‚ÄúWtf is this kid doing?‚Äù. I also ran around, wrecking havoc, almost breaking the blinds, attempted to steal from the local walmart, and last but not least, kicked a teacher in the shin. 

So here‚Äôs some symptoms that got me extremely sure that I have ADHD. The three main ones that usually mark ADHD are Hyperactivity, Impulsivity, and Inattentiveness. Let‚Äôs start with the first one. Hyperactivity: I‚Äôm always restless and my mind races, I usually talk really fast. I find myself going off on a tangent too much. If I don‚Äôt go outside at least once a day I turn batshit crazy. One time I ran to a piercing shop at 8:50pm, 10 minutes before it‚Äôs closing, just to get a piercing because I ‚Äúhad to do something that day‚Äù. 

Which ties into Impulsivity: I make many decisions on a whim. I waste a lot of money, had my first time at 15 with someone who doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about me, had unprotected sex, took a lot of drugs (in a form of self-medication I suppose). Besides the more extreme side of things, my actions usually escaped before my thoughts. Everyone tells me to ‚Äúthink before you act‚Äù. 

And now finally, Inattentiveness. I almost never paid attention at school. I never properly studied for anything before. I was never able to finish a book, let alone pay attention to a full paragraph in the book, because my mind wanders too much. I am extremely forgetful which makes my parents yell at me every time, yet I still forget to do what they demand. I was looked down upon at times because nobody could count on me. I was, and still am irresponsible. Somehow, I actually did really well in highschool despite this, so I got into a good university, however I completely fucked up my first term of university because of ADHD and Depression pulling some sick combos on me.

Sorry for writing so much (again, this much writing comes from my hyperactivity). This was a word dump. Anyway, I hope this helps you see if you might have ADHD or not, and if you do, I hope you get the help you need ASAP. Don‚Äôt wait too long like I had to."

ADHD,fj0rce7,t1_fj01mxp,1582906162.0,"Yes it doesn‚Äôt always mean they don‚Äôt have them. But personally, I used to exhibit ‚ÄúADD‚Äù (For the sake of my explanation I‚Äôll use it) symptoms, which means I didn‚Äôt have ANY typical hyperactivity symptoms. Because of this, my parents never took me to the psychiatrist to get tested and treated for ADHD until two months ago. My extreme inattentive symptoms were overlooked because people typically associate ADHD with the hyperactivity (three of my friends at the time were ADHD-PH). This led me to 18 years ago of being unmedicated and being fully misunderstood throughout my childhood.

As you said it‚Äôs ‚Äúrarely a problem to the extent the inattentive symptoms are‚Äù which is a perfect reason why I used to describe my symptoms as ADD when people ask, long before I discovered this sub and it‚Äôs usage of ADHD-PI instead. If you wanna describe ADHD-PI to the common folk/regular people, I personally found ADD easier to use to describe myself even if it‚Äôs ‚Äúinaccurate‚Äù because it does a good job explaining what my symptoms are like (as does my friend, she says she has ADD instead to clarify she doesn‚Äôt have the ‚ÄúH‚Äù to people) (this is also before I discovered my impulsivity is intense and correlated with my hyperactivity, but that‚Äôs not my point here) Now I use ‚ÄúADHD-C‚Äù but nobody in the general population knows what the hell that means.

Personally for me, if ‚ÄúADD‚Äù (So ADHD-PI, or hell, even just without the classic exhibited hyperactivity) was more well-known, I might‚Äôve been treated for my ADHD sooner. My teachers never detected the symptoms as a child which caused more harm than good. My report cards never showed any signs to point towards ADHD like my other friends had. My parents used this as an excuse to not get me medication, because I don‚Äôt actually have it if my report cards don‚Äôt point out the possibility, right? /s My mom said I never showed ‚Äútypical signs‚Äù so she never suspected it.

From your other comments, I see you struggle with the concept of social hierarchies. School can be a bitch sometimes and the popularity contest is absolutely draining. It took me a while before I let it go, but letting it go does wonders; I actually became much more confident, free, and made a big group of friends in the end (which ended up with mostly guys, but not on purpose, we just had the same interests). Hang in there, it will be over before you know it."

I suggest that if you two love each other and think it‚Äôs worth to push through despite your parents, then continue the relationship as is. It is YOUR relationship not their‚Äôs. Make the big steps as you want. Move in as you want. Etc. But don‚Äôt be disappointed if the parents don‚Äôt approve; they are stubborn and it‚Äôs like talking to a wall."
relationship_advice,fijgdkg,t3_f86ndq,1582446711.0,"Funny because I sorta had this mentality back in high school too, so I see where you are coming from. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not a good mindset to have; you and your gf should be a team, not a pair of rivals. So I‚Äôll give you some advice and an example from my own life.

My bf has a lot of girl friends, and I have a lot of guy friends. Back then, what irked me was him hanging out with them one on one (because I‚Äôve never done that before). To counter this, I started hanging out with my guy friends one on one. I‚Äôve made some close friends due to this, but also unfortunately led a lot of people on. It became an endless back and forth jealousy contest; often he would be hanging out with his girl best friend on the same day that I was hanging out with my guy best friend. Things almost got ugly fast. 

Why am I telling you this? Because I want you to know that competing with your gf is not the way to go. If any problems arise and you feel suspicious about her guy friends, then communication is key. Already, you are feeling nervous that her opposite friend count outnumbers yours. I think the best thing to do here is to build trust with her, and if it makes you feel better, make more female friends. But I suggest to make friends for the purpose of getting to know people, not to counter/compete with your gf.

Remember, it‚Äôs not a competition, and there‚Äôs no need for it to be. She chose you for a reason, and that‚Äôs all that matters."
