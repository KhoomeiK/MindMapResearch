It doesn't need to be a 5'8+ guy for you to feel loved. You can still be sexy at your height and body size, but not all men will see it that way of course, its normal, you can't be attractive to everyone, no one is. 

Also don't think too much about it, for example when I look at a girl I'm interested in its not her boobs or ass that attracts me first, I look at her face and eyes then her personality, the body comes much later and will not in any way lessen the 'Sexyness' she achieved by her personality if she has. 

Last thing if a guy rejects you because you're short or because you have a small anything, that just proves who he really is, I doubt you get too many rejections though(my assumption :) ) men aren't too picky especially with short girls, you are all cute to us. Just my 2c :)
