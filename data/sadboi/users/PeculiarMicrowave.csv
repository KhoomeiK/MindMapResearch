As for your students, it isn’t really any of their business where you are. You could have another teacher say that you’re in the hospital and about how long you’ll be there for. If you’re close with your students, it could also pay off to just tell them and start a discussion about mental health.

I’ve been depressed for years and I’m not sad all the time- a lot of the time I’m pretty happy. For me, it manifests as hopelessness, feeling like a burden, etc. It might be worth looking into. You might want to take a screening. Although you can feel suicidal without being depressed, it is a sign something’s wrong and it’s good to rule out all possibilities."

But other than that, yes, I do think there’s something wrong with me. It’s hard not to when you’re always the one overreacting and crying over seemingly nothing. I know it’s just my brain being a dick, but it’s hard not to think you’re messed up when you aren’t able to operate without being on medications. Maybe it’s just me. I don’t think there’s anything that’s undiagnosed and I know that what I’m feeling is just a result of my conditions. I think another part of it is that since there are so many people with what I have who are able to cope, it makes me feel like I should be able to as well.

It is hard, though. It feels like she loves alcohol more than her own daughter, which I know isn’t true because she flies out here to see me since she’s so desperate to be with me. The only problem with that is that until she gets sober, I really don’t want to see her. It’s still rough but with her out of the house, it’s been more peaceful than it’s been in years."

askatherapist,fn8fzms,t3_fz4qxc,1586740791.0,"This happened to be too. I stopped going to therapy because of it. I would just completely blank and get super uncomfortable. I just spaced out and listened to the clock tick. Whenever this would happen and the therapist would ask a question after that, I couldn’t snap out of it and would just end up staring off into the distance for the rest of it. I would give her small nods and shrugs but other than that, I was gone."
askatherapist,fn8f7a3,t3_fzqxhq,1586740287.0,"Not a therapist but I’ve been in a similar situation.

It’s good that you’re not self harming. Eventually, the need to do it will subside, so long as you don’t self harm. The urge to do it probably won’t be entirely gone for a while, but it’ll fade. At least, that’s what happened with me. The reason I stopped is because I didn’t want to disappoint my friends or my therapist (I have a really hard time lying about stuff like that). Now, I’ve been clean for a few months. It took a month for the urges to settle down but they did. I believe in you- you can stop this. This might just be the push you need."
askatherapist,fn8duac,t3_g03nto,1586739425.0,"Obligatory not a therapist but if you’re having suicidal thoughts and urges to self harm, it’s important to see a professional. People have upswings and downswings in their mental health all the time but if it’s getting that bad, you need to see someone. You aren’t overreacting. Trust me. I’ve been in your situation before, and I also thought I was overreacting and that I could just push through it. I was cutting again (about once a week- not as bad as some but still not good) and had urges and suicidal thoughts at least daily. One night I had a really bad panic attack and decided to ask my dad to bring me to the hospital. I got 5150’d and sent to the mental hospital for four or five days. I’m super glad I went because, even though I wasn’t as bad as I could have been, going there stopped me in my tracks and sent me on a better path. It’s better to catch yourself slipping than fall into a pit you can’t get out of.

TL;DR- You’re not overreacting and should really see a professional. It’s better to catch yourself early than get to a place you can’t get out of."
