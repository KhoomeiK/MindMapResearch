heartbreak,fbg0gr6,t3_ed6q3a,1576828294.0,I know exactly how you feel:( its hard to replace the one you love but you just have to focus on the little things that make you smile. You loved him how you should've! That's how you should love! But you arent alone‚ù§
depression,f9ks00f,t3_e5e9vs,1575406693.0,This is exactly what put me in the position I am right now. You have to be careful and always keep your guard up at least a small bit it seems. Even the people that say they love you the most may turn around and hurt you.
depression,f8uy2zu,t1_f8uy0d8,1574850591.0,Life is just so hard with everything happening to me right now. Everything was just so good and now it feels completely lost.
depression,f8uxuut,t3_e2e4m8,1574850229.0,Self worth and confidence is what I've been struggling with for a long time. I know exactly how you feel. To make matter worse I think I just lost the person that had helped me the most. I love her so much but my emotions just take over and I say or ask really stupid things. Its hard to imagine seeing yourself as having worth when you've felt so worthless for so long.

MortalKombat,esihaa6,t1_esih6ab,1562013680.0,"It will work but you have to wait after your ""delay wakeup window"" has passed"
MortalKombat,esi5y70,t1_esi5u67,1562007423.0,Like in the mk game? Cause you can adjust button mapping on the actual ps4 but it would still be stance switch/roll.
MortalKombat,esi0g3j,t1_esi02nf,1562004465.0,"I think we should leave tha stupid stance button alone and just use r1 for spending meter. All meter can be spent with that button lol it makes sense. 
After a move-r1 amplify
Rolls- fwd or back r1 on the ground as to not accidentally delay wakeup and not roll
Breaker- just make down r1?
And with wakeups r1+2 or r1+3"
MortalKombat,eshyzfa,t1_eshx7qb,1562003667.0,The breaker in this game is weird. But that's the only one I don't completely hate lol. The timing can be weird but make sure you let go of block before you try breaking
MortalKombat,eshvwto,t1_eshvh4y,1562002011.0,I know! Why the absolute fuck is UP 3??? Why not r1 and 3 or 2?? And with rolls why can I not just input fwd and r1 and itll do the wakeup when I'm able to? I dont wanna spend 10 mins before I play practicing rolls and wakeups-.-
depression,erlkiyq,t3_c2fuf3,1560989645.0,I hate it. Talking to my parents about my problems make them feel so dumb. Like I shouldn't be upset about this and so I try and distance myself. Also it's the nausea that's the worst:(
lonely,ergau45,t1_ergajs0,1560831981.0,I know. I've feel like I've been helping my girlfriend a ton and she doesnt care to much about me. She and all of my friends that talk to her says that she does but I'm not sure what to think. None of my friends are talking to me much right now.
lonely,ergaeeq,t3_c1xcgf,1560831548.0,This is how I feel. I always try and help my friends with anything I can and nobody ever talks to me. For the past few months I havnt been able to shake the feeling that most people dont care about me.
