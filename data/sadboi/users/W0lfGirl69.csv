I've been in therapy for 5 years now. Had several therapists and none of ever did such a thing. The therapist can suggest to do a family session, but ONLY if you're ok with it/want it. What your therapist did was basically violating you, your safe space and basically invalidating you in a way.

This is very controlling!! This is a one way ticket to having your daughter resent you and religion. I myself went to a somewhat religious school and I hated it. I was bullied constantly, FORCED to pray everyday AGAINST MY OWN WILL. Today? I have severe PTSD, general and social anxiety and more. 

These are the most crucial times of her life. Don't ruin that.

Edit: just adding that I was mentally, emotionally, physically and sexually abused in that school. The teachers/school staff? DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Please don't do this to her.

Dog trainer here. ALL dogs need the basic training, no matter the size, breed or age.

The ""guiet"" command is important. It does not teach the dog not to bark at all. It just teaches them that when you say ""quiet"" then they need to stop barking.

Dogs who constantly bark at anything can drive people crazy. They can't be taken anywhere, people may stop visiting and it can drive the neighbors crazy. 

Keep up the good work."

Encountering any wild animals can be scary. In my city and especially in my neighborhood we have coyotes too, but we also have porcupines (they're not AS dangerous but it's better to not provoke them as their needles can be painful) and we have wild boar (PUMBAA). I've encountered them countless of times and it's always a bit scary. Especially the boars. 

Little story:

I live in a neighborhood that has a small wooded area with a creek and we have all those animals listed above. Now there's this small wide entrance to that area that is also fenced, and people (as well as me and my family) walk our dogs there and it's just nice, it's a little peace of nature and the dogs like to do their ""business"" there. One night, me and my mom were walking the dogs and in the middle of this clearing there are benches and this light that turns on when there's movement. Remember, this happened around 10-11 pm. It was DARK. Suddenly, that light turns on, and I see this HUGE boar running towards us. I basically did what you're NOT supposed to do. I PICKED UP MY LITTLE DOG AND RAN LIKE HELL. And left my mom and one of the other dog behind me... not my proudest moment lol. Now, I didn't run that far, it was just a few steps basically, when my brain goes ""shit! Mom! And ""other dog's name""!"" So I froze in place, yelled in a terrified voice ""mom!"", turned around and saw that the boar just took a 90 degrees turn and went into the creek/woods.
Took me like a solid 30 minutes to calm down. My heart was racing. 
Now, for me it's a very funny story, but at that moment I was in a fight or flight mode. It was  terrifying to see that beast just running full speed towards us (it was pretty far from us but still). Also, my mom was totally oblivious and did not notice what was happening."

Technically you did adopt, just from a breeder and the ""adoption fees"" were a bit more expensive. 
People buy dogs for many reasons(allergies, working dog, therapy dogs, sentimental attachments to certain hard to find breeds as puppies and more...). As long as the breeder is certified and does everything by the book, caring and responsible, you're all good.

Heck, next week I'm buying a labrador puppy (first time ever that I'm buying a dog from a breeder, always had rescue dogs) and my reason? I'm studying therapy dog training and as someone who has little experience and need a therapy dog to work with, my best option is to buy a dog where I know his/her family history, they tested the parents for any health problems (mostly hip problems and other common issues Labradors might have). I can't risk having a rescue dog where I don't know the history of his parents, nor his own personal history (was he abused or not? Any aggression problems that may surface? Etc...). I don't have (yet) enough experience to train any dog to become a therapy dog (which is possible yeah? You just need the experience to do that).

I have flown quite a bit through out my life. I ALWAYS recline the seat if I can, as i chronic back pain and it eases the pain a bit to recline the seat. Also, I'm 6ft (female) and when the person in front of me reclines their seat it BARELY affects me in any way (I also prefer the aisle as it can give me a bit extra leg room and cuz of medical issues I have to get up and walk around/stretch my legs and I don't want to bother other passengers).

Go ahead and RECLINE YOU SEAT. 

Also, as some have mentioned here too, if you're not supposed to recline your seat they wouldn't give you that option. But they do, meaning, anyone can recline their seat if that what they want.

dog trainer here. There are many ways you can teach a teach a dog not to jump on you, mostly are force free or in the new classic way which uses some correction (basically either using only positive reinforcement or negative punishment in force free - negative punishment means basically removing something the dog wants/loves to stop the behavior for instance the dog pulls during walks, you stop the walk wait till there's no more pulling and resuming the walk in the positive reinforcement, in classic ways you use both PR and NG, but also positive punishment, so keeping with the example of walks and pulling, whenever the dog pulls you basically both stop the walk AND add something that he doesn't like/want for instance correcting the behavior by giving a tug on the leash {depending on the dog's reaction you adjust the strength of the correction} I hope this makes sense to you OP). Hitting the dog WILL NOT achieve the affect you want, it will cause him stress, teach him to be afraid of you (which I'm guessing you do not want) and maybe even traumatize him or make him reactive (which is very easy for his breed. I suggest that you DO talk to the boss, and worse case scenario, find a different dog trainer. You should feel comfortable with the person that trains your dog/s at all times. 

I suggest either turn your back to the dog/ignore him and once he calms down give him positive reinforcement with treats or affection, also you could teach him that only once hi sits or does a certain trick he will get the affection he is seeking for by jumping on you."

puppy101,fgmgmrx,t3_ezbzei,1580924149.0,"Hey OP, as others have already mentioned, no breeder should be separating the pups from the mother at the age of 6 weeks. That's way too early. The EARLIEST you can separate them is 8 weeks. You did your research, you tried, but a 6 week old puppy is not like an 8 week old puppy or even a 10 week old puppy. They have VERY different needs in every stage of them growing up (even a 1 year old is considered still a pup mentally mostly. 2 years is when the dog is a full adult physically and mentally) and it's EXTREMELY EXHAUSTING to raise a puppy (14 years of raising dogs and pups, and almost 2 years into professionally training), and honestly not everyone can actually handle raising puppies. 


Don't feel bad. From what I understand you tried your best but it didn't work out. It happens. IMO it's the breeder's fault for separating the pup from it's family too early and the way they (or was it just the wife?) acted cold towards you for basically admitting you can't handle this and being responsible enough to bring the puppy back to it's own family, so later they could find him a better home.


BTW, I had a dog that came from an abusive situation and tried to te-train her and take care of her. Was way too hard for me (with 2 more dogs who also have been abused before I got to them and just adopted them, who have their own issues as well) and my mom. We decided it's best for everyone to give her away, and we found her a good home (told them upfront about her issues to make sure that they are aware and CAN actually take care of her), and now she's happy and thriving (from what I heard last... unfortunately I lost their info so can't contact them anymore). 

Also, if you still want a dog maybe look into getting grown adult dog or maybe a puppy whose at least several months old, just a thought :)

And again, you tried and did your best. It's ok. It happens. You did right by you, yours mother and the puppy.

I get what she means and I completely know what your son is going through. I myself am mixed (American on dad's side, and mom is half slovak half arab) and live in Israel. I went to all arab schools and hated every single day. For 14 years I was bullied and it all started because I wasn't 100% arab, and it destroyed my mental health, I was always looking for a place or a culture to feel like I belong. And honestly? It feels like I'm still searching for that. 

Trying to find your place is hard, especially when you're mixed. It's completely ok to not feel as connected to a certain culture, and it's important to feel like you belong. It's great your son is finding some places where he feels like he belongs, it's very important. 


On a more personal note: 

I personally, due to trauma mostly but also for not feeling like I belong, I excluded myself from the arab community as much as I could. I still enjoy some of the music and traditions and stuff with family, and I do have friends who are arabs but they are all more open minded and less judgmental. Again, this may sound racist to some people when they don't understand what it means to be mixed and get judged based on your skin tone or race. I pass as white (mostly people assume I'm Russian lol) but it goes 2 ways once they figure out I'm part arab. They are always surprised and then either just accept and move along or they become kinda racist and start judging and asking RUDE questions and looking at you like you're a terrorist.

I would say leave him but you mentioned that overall you guys are happy together.

I suggest talking to another dog trainer that has maybe a more positive training approach as a start. It's also important you feel comfortable with the trainer, so if you feel a bit uncomfortable with this, he's not the trainer for you in my opinion."

It's not your fault or your problem that the boyfriend is a pervy perv. And as you mentioned you clearly aren't into men and he has a gf. Your roommate needs to rethink some things about him IMO. Also, it's your place too, not just hers, and HE doesn't live there, if it was me I'd tell him off. I would be VERY uncomfortable having a guy acting like a perv in my own place and I'd tell him or your roommate off. Like what the actual f***? And the fact that BOTH of them walk around literally half naked even when you have guests over and then you roommate demanding YOU cover up cuz HER boyfriend can't keep his eyes off of you is just hypocritical to me. You do you. It's your place too after all.

Also, I suggest you have a serious talk with your roommate about this, and make her see how f***ed up this situation is basically. Maybe even show her this post and the comments."

As someone who has 3 animals atm, you NEVER leave anything important somewhere they can reach. 

When it comes to kids, that rule has to be doubly if not triply re-enforced. Kids will grab at ANYTHING. I don't have kids yet it seems I have more common sense that your step sister here. 

Also, my grandmother (RIP) was a professional babysitter (she was a nurse too, worked with premature babies) and basically what she HAD to do, was make sure the kids are safe, that they are fed, and anything else that comes with taking care if kids (like playing, changing diapers for babies etc...) but it was NOT her responsibility if the kids broke something on accident.

Damn... like what? No no no no. You are NOT responsible for you sister in any way whatsoever. As someone who has depression episodes, yes it's nice having friends or family members to take you out or hang out with you or whatnot, but in the end it's up to me to get back on my feet. I also feel uncomfortable when anyone other than my mom spends money on me.

Also, you mom is TA here. 

You deserve to spend some alone time with your kids without anyone else. It's your time to bond with them. And from i understand from you post is that you guys already spend a lot of time with your sister as is, so you DEFINITELY deserve some alone quality time with ur kids. 

And about your sister holding grudges... I think most would agree it's NOT healthy at all, especially over such trivial stuff. Like it's common sense (at least for me) that a parent (especially a mother) would want some alone time with her kids."

First, the whole ""if you're really my friend you'd do  x for me"" I hate it. That's a fake friend right there, or at least someone who doesn't really care about your boundaries. 

It sounds like she knew about this about you and yet she still tries to make you wear something you'd be uncomfortable in. That's not ok. 

Also, her blocking you over this screams to me that she doesn't really care about your friendship or you that much. 

Now I personally have body image issues with anxiety and also I have big curves and am on the bustier side too, all that does not help when I actually do want to wear something like that dress, cuz it feels like all the guys are just staring and mentally undressing me, or I feel like the girls are also staring and judging me. So I understand not wanting to wear that dress especially at a such big event where you are also a bridesmaid (you're put in a spotlight more than if you were just a guest but less than the bride, hope you understand what I mean here)."

A few years ago I use to have a lot of sleepovers with my friends and we usually all crashed in my bedroom (the most at one time was like 12 or 13 people in my room) but we were all very good friends and respected each other. Yeah we would drink booze or smoke weed (my mom preferred that if I am going to do this I might as well be home where I'm safe and not roaming the streets). No one had any issues, no parents had any problems with this. And my friends also always helped clean up the day after.

Basically what I'm saying (and what I'm understanding from you) is that you let them feel at home, that they are safe and like you said they friends and there are more than 2 genders so yeah, giving the choice where to sleep and separating was the best way to go.
