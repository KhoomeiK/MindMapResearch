depression,f5ksrz5,t1_f5kr2ef,1572269458.0,"Her love towards me is ridiculous maybe thats why my love feels small.

The line where i say :   There are days that i love her and days that i dont feel anything for herThose are the days that im so suicidal and depressed that i dont feel anything towards her.

The thing that really depresses me that i dont love her as much she loves me. And i dont want to lose her because she really understands my anxiety and depression... But every time we meet or go for a walk she is on me hugging me and kissing me... And im like a dead man without emotions. And thats what bothers me, i want to love as well but i just dont know if i love her, or im just that unexperienced ? I really dont know whats up"

I think about death everyday.I just dont see the reason why should i be in a relationship if im sad about this world. Everything seems so pointless to me. She tells me that she will fix my feelings about everything but i dont think anyone can really help me. We just met at work 4 days ago she is a new worker, everything just came way to fast. She tells that it was love at first sight and she had the feeling that im the right one... We talked about things and we listen to the same music, we play games,we like animals everything seems perfect.
