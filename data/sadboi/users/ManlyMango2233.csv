She shines best when controlling multiple members under their turret, and in these situations the poke/advantage gained from 800 true dmg autos, massive q hitbox and a quick combo means you don't need AAs as much as other ADs. You aren't going to get/need many opportunities to get off more than 5 autos because of your oneshot potential with w/aa/q/aa/e/aa/r  (give or take an auto depending on target)

Might mean nothing and maybe I'm straight up wrong (still think not getting rapidfire 3rd on cait is kinda trolling since it scales off your range) but something to think about."
