Doing the same motions without the weed actually helped a lot in getting over it. Like, not lighting the lighter or even filling the bowl but still taking drags off the bong.

bipolar,evag1or,t1_ev9c328,1564346811.0,"To hop on the train here: before I was diagnosed with bipolar I was diagnosed with depression and given Lexapro (which made me vomit) and then Prozac (which made me manic). Eventually got so manic that I was having a panic attack every day. Kept getting sent to the ER where tons of IV Xanax wouldn't even calm me. 

First drug that worked was Haldol. Later I was put on extended release Depakote. Anti psychotics have helped me far more than SSRI's have. If anyone is having repeated issues with their SSRI meds and you haven't tried anything branded as anti-seizure or anti-psychotic, I strongly urge you to discuss doing so with ur psych. The change was immediately huge for me. Not perfect mentally but in a much better space to work through my shit.

Edit: Worth noting at the end here that I am mostly manic with short periods of depression. Someone who deals with depressive symptoms longer than a couple hours-2 days max like me might not do as well on antipsychotics."

Whenever I'm sad and my therapist asks me to draw back on good days I think about past manic days and it lifts me out of the funk."

bipolar,eofdmd4,t3_brlkro,1558531523.0,"If I'm on vacation, or in a similar situation where I have pre-planned events but nothing urgent, it's great. I have endless energy and my brain gets into a sort of floating fog. I can usually feel it coming on because colors will start to be brighter, I'll start to notice how the sun comes through the trees, I can't stop talking, etc. Truly it's amazing, the joy will be so intense it brings me to tears.

However, if I'm having a stressful day at work, or if something happens to me that is unexpected or frustrating, I completely fly off the handle. Often just reading a post online will have my whole body shaking with rage. In these moments I almost live outside of myself, and I'm scared of the potential I have to seriously hurt others, either emotionally or physically. I have a lot of friends who admire my strength in confronting problems, but really I just need an outlet for all this angry energy inside me. And if I don't focus on putting it into the right places, it will eat me from the inside out."
