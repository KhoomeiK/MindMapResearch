In terms of how it's changed how I view my art, I definitely see it in a less critical light knowing that people genuinely like my stuff, although I still have ways to go.

I guess one thing I was worried about was that I'd become complacent if I rely on social media numbers to boost my confidence, but so far it's only done the opposite, so that would've been nice to know back then."

ArtistLounge,fnvuoy5,t1_fntvq91,1587305191.0,"I wouldn't say stigma, but there's definitely some emphasis on people who are ""self-taught"" vs people who aren't. IMO, in most cases, the distinction is pretty negligible, just seems like people who go to art school simply get more resources at their disposal (access to studios, figure drawing sessions, etc), those who can't or choose to not pursue an art education can still become professionals. I mean, just look at the average art college student and you'll understand why a huge percentage of art graduates aren't employed in art-related fields despite having access to connections."

Most of my feedback has been from my parents (very unsupportive) and randoms on the internet (their comments don't hold much weight when you hardly have any connection to them despite being positive). I'm basically in a vacuum where my only measure of self-worth is the kind of feedback I get for my art. The irony is that no amount of positive feedback I get from people online can satisfy me, so I'm just stuck in a cycle of self loathing. I don't know why I'm typing all this out."
ArtistLounge,fj1pci1,t1_fj1nvcy,1582924852.0,"I guess part of it does come from being left behind and not being able to make a living off of art, something that comes from just not knowing how the professional art world works (and the world in general).

ArtistLounge,fikv35b,t3_f8ef02,1582487858.0,"Shilling. I join Discord servers of big artists with similar subject matters. They usually don't mind if you plug a link to your latest post every time you finish a piece. Obviously they won't retweet it or anything 100% of the time, but even just one retweet from an account with 1k+ followers can get you far. From there, you can slowly build up an audience. As for finding these servers, the best way is to just find artists you're following and see if they have a public link to their servers. I've found 3-4 just from a handful of artists on twitter and I'm sure there's plenty more out there."
ArtistLounge,fijz18v,t3_f86no4,1582468474.0,"I'm the same way. However, I don't think it's a good mindset to have, since if you're like me, you'll always feel some sense of inferiority when you have some high end artist in mind. I think a better thing to keep in mind is to focus more on what you should be improving with respect to your art. For instance, I know that my values and perspective need work, so I'm currently working on those two. From there, you'll naturally get a better sense of where you stand in the artist world and improve along the way."
ArtistLounge,fh2wby3,t3_d5r5ys,1581261782.0,"Late but I'm exactly the same way. I know a large part of it has to do with me connecting success to my worthiness as a person, so if I'm not the best in the room, then what am I good for?

I know the old mantra of only comparing yourself to your past self, but as nice as it is, it only works briefly before I return to the shitty mindset of comparing myself to others. As silly as it sounds, it gives me a little high almost every time I see that I'm better than someone, although it's very brief before it turns into the usual ""why am I like this?"" This mindset makes me both complacent and anxious, and I know it's going to be the thing that'll keep me from truly growing as an artist.

Now I'm at a pretty decent art program, the only difference is that it's not too prestigious and I'm legitimately better than 99% of the students there. I've never really been in this position before, but even though I certainly had my ego stroked for a bit, I quickly realized that I'm going to be stuck with that skill level for a few years with no one to really look up to within my vicinity. Sure, art in itself is varied and you can take inspiration from even the most amateur pieces, but as someone who focuses more on technical skill, I find myself in a pretty unstimulating environment.

I got a bit off topic, but regardless I'm hoping to break out of that mindset in the near future. Being involved in art communities IRL has certainly helped since about everyone I've talked to doesn't have that mindset, and it's honestly refreshing to be in such a non-judgmental environment."

ADHD,f2sy9zk,t3_dcdnip,1570388445.0,"I'm in a similar position, just younger. Never been able to hold a job for more than a few months, dropped out of college twice due to not being able to complete assignments on time (which has been an issue all my life but the consequences were never severe up until then), organization issues abundant, inability to focus, diagnosed with severe anxiety, etc. At this point I just want to try a stimulant and see what it does to me, and yet I fear that I wouldn't be able to tell whether it's working because I have ADHD or if it's working because it's a stimulant. I know I have *something* and I'm going to talk with another psychiatrist about it later and hopefully get a decent analysis, but for now it all seems so fuzzy to me.

Interesting that Adderall didn't work for you. The way I see it, there's one of two ways that this can go: the doctors say you don't have ADHD and drop the whole thing altogether, or they tell you that it wasn't the 'right medication' for you and they put you on some other stimulant. At what point will it stop? Will it ever end up working for you or will you find yourself tolerating a prescription that you don't think too much about? Will you say ""ENOUGH"" and stop medication altogether?

Can I ask how you got tested? I had to go through some third party psychiatric clinic who put me through a basic IQ test, a general questionnaire, and a Connor's CPT-III, which I apparently did so well on that there's ""very little to no chance I have ADHD,"" that it was 99% my anxiety keeping me back, and yet my therapist/psychiatrist didn't exactly believe it. I'm just unsure myself but I don't want to be dependent on a prescription that might not be right for me. However, I did feel pretty cheated by the whole thing since I was hardly asked any questions about my struggles that point to ADHD.

Sorry for the text dump."

For me, it's as simple as comparing myself to others less when I'm feeling bad about my current skills, and instead focus on how far I've come along. I've looked through your art and it's definitely nice enough that I don't immediately see any glaring issues, but to you I'm sure it's absolute crap and there's no reason to show anyone. At least that's how I tend to feel about my art despite being shown otherwise. It's good to compare your current skills with your end goals, but I think if it gets to the point where it's keeping you from drawing in the first place, it's good to reevaluate things.
