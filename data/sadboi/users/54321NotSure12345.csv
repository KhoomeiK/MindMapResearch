depression,fde5qsq,t3_ejsoej,1578331774.0,"Life is meaningless. 

Depression is normal, everyone experiences it, for the rest of there lives. (rich/poor, single/married, etc)

No body cares, people are selfish, always will be.(to include yourself and your family, all of them)

Learn to live with yourself, your pain, your loneliness, your dark side, your everything, or don't. 

This pointless cycle of life will continue, until it doesn't.

Find pleasure and joy where you can, or don't.

Life is pain, suffering, boredom. 

Once you understand that you'll either draw a blank feeling from within yourself and continue with your saddened state OR you'll fight to change that and face numerous challenges and failures along the way.

It's all nonsense, all of existence and life.

Have a nice day, or don't."

My first Legendary was Nethril as well. My best pulls occurred during those first two weeks.

Now two months in my pulls are mediocre at best to trash at worst. 30% average, 70% trash."
RaidShadowLegends,f49gudq,t3_djzu2n,1571465649.0,Smart move if you're looking to farm medals. Put a single champ while you're online and keep refreshing till you find a single champ and or weak teams. If more people did this it'd be faster to farm medals...

Arena is a cake walk if you know how to exploit its weakness.
