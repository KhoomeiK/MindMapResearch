Everything you say is true. However, your making 1 mistake. All paths have trouble and barriers. Rich well-bred have different obstacles to and much more efficient too. So instead of a safe car journey to success and creating a good new family yourself, you need a starting plan.

Stop damaging yourself. You can do this by minimising interaction with your family (even uncles and aunts). Cut the links. Even one bridge is enough for them to poison you. This is also important since we all have one cup of water. Some bigger some smaller. we give this water to the people we SPEND ANY TIME WITH. This is important to realise since you need to play for the long game. You can not give your family too much of your water since you are going to have kids in the future and you need to save some for them. Cut yours loses with your toxic family. It will feel like cutting an arm with cancer of YOURSELF, WITH A SAW, but that you really had no choice, since it will destroy your life and consume you. 

Most people don't care about themselves, but when they realise it will make them bad parents and make them a bridge for cancer to spread to their kids, they don't even think twice about it. 

Don't say things like, 'no i am strong enough and have enough water for family and kids' toxic people don't use water coz they need it. They use it to lower people via Stockholm syndrome. Every interaction with your family will alter you genetically and make it likely your kids will come out sick. There are hidden costs.

Next, in the words of John D Rockefeller ', I pity the boy that did not struggle early in life' coming from a man who became the most powerful and in such a toxic and abusive house, that his own father kept robbing his savings for WINTER FOOD for him and his mother. The obstacle does not define you. It is not there to destroy you. It is there to make you learn the most money-making skill in business and finance. To learn early on, that no matter how emotional you are, to always be strong enough to CUT YOUR LOSES! The world will always have an opportunity waiting for you, you FUCKING CONSCIOUS LEGEND!!!!

If your father dies (another example), you could think 2 things. How you miss him, or how great your time with him was. This is proven by your brain saving this memory as a positive nostalgia. Enjoying rather than missing the memory is more empowering. This is because it means you promise yourself to keep finding unique and better experiences. 

Not missing people, but rather being grateful, is not forgetting them. You are forgetting them when instead of remembering the good memories, you are just crying. The crying is you being selfish coz God wanted the gift back, that he lent you. 

The memories you make with the gift, are yours to keep. Like someone lending you a pen to write a poem as a chapter in your life. Once they take the pen back, they won't demand you give them your poem, coz it has his ink on it. You also won't cry about the pen, but rather enjoy the experience (nostalgia/poem) you produced with them. Nor will you say that you can never use another pen or write another poem. Put your poem in a frame and hang it on the wall. That is positive.

The example is too emotionally charged (but still does not change anything, only tricks mentally weaker people to fall for this. Propaganda basically. But i know that is not our intention). But taking emotional and moral aspects out of this, THIS IS IRRELEVANT!!!!!! Personal situations and circumstances are irrelevant. I must live with the cards we are dealt with. No matter how crappy they are. Even if it is not our fault. This is a law and a fact of nature. Laws must not be designed to save people from nature!!!!! Laws can only be made to ensure freedom.--- Also, we ill die if we do not have a life long ongoing usage of eater and food. Are we slaves now to the farmers and we'll owners? Remember, as free as NATURALLY PERMITTED. We can not call ourselves slaves because we must consume food and water to stay alive. That medicine is just a specific difference for that person. Some people can not eat anything but meat. Does that mean that they are slaves to meat producers? Also, you seem to be forgetting something......the reason that well of water exists, is because the man built it, escalated it and so on and so forth. The reason that food exists, if because someone raised the animals and veg and harvested it. Blood sweat and tears. They took risks. They could have failed in their production. Now through experience, they found more efficient ways to produce and provided jobs for other sand can afford not to work himself. He has paid off his investment and now we are going to call him a slave owner??? Remember laws are not to protect from nature!!! This is irrelevant to everything. If anything, the man (or we) would be dead if the good maker did not make the well and the farmer did not make the food and the scientist or businessman did not invest in the medicine. If you were going to DIE if the resource had not been produced ahead of your need like the farmer, well maker and medicine maker did, then u would not have even been able to beg. You would have been dead. So instead of seeing them as hostage-takers. See them as heroes coming to throw a lifeline, when you were drowning in the water. If u were going to drown anyway, then their resources (lifeline or inflatable) only extend your life. And i don't know about you, but what is the one thing people say, when their life has been saved????? I DO NOT KNOW HOW I WILL EVER REPAY YOU.

Another person has the medicine and demands------- this is just attacking people for wanting to grow and profit. This is again an invalid and emotionally charged example that does not remain an object. But still, he has the right to profit from his creation. PERIOD!!!!!

 the sick one to labour for them without pay in exchange for the life long dosages of it. ------- Did the medicine man point a gun to his head??? Did he seek him out and force him to buy?? Was he coerced and threatened with physical harm?? No!!!! He does not need that man to buy. There are plenty of people that would pay the price and thank the high heavens for the man's existence and thinking ahead. Remember, exchanging products and services is VOLUNTARY!!!! If he does not think working to stay alive is worth paying for the price of life, then he can just decide to die. No one is forcing him. (But remember the 'i don't know how i will ever repay you' the fact that the medicine maker was so smart, as to make a product that SAVES lives and is AFFORDABLE ENOUGH for a man with a TERMINAL illness to be able to pay for, is a miracle!!!! If anything, it means that when the man goes to buy groceries, he just needs to buy one pack of this medicine to stay alive. Plus we work anyways. Life is about producing and working. That is a law of nature)

The person works for them, receives the medicine and lives a normal life.-------- again, what a hero!!!!!!!! Someone was able to produce a life-saving drug food and water so efficiently, that a terminally ill man can buy them and go to work and live a NORMAL LIFE!!! 

The price of nature requires users to pay to stay alive is not what takes our freedom. It is what makes our life. It is not human killing us, nor is it any other living creature. If a living being stops looking for resources to maintain its existence, then they should have the freedom to die!!!!! ( this is where euthanasia stuff comes in). 

But overall, you can not force someone to produce for someone else. Let's say u did that. What does u think will happen? In future, all medicine makers won't make medicines anymore, because they are not allowed to sell it (since it 'enslaved the one that needs it) and must only give it for free if it is life-threatening. Plus ( i am going to use cancer in this example) the cancer scientist himself will die if he makes it since he will not make money. Why won't he make money?? Because all his drugs are LIFE EXTENDING and under the YOUR FREEDOM LAW (i know it's not your law, but just one example your trying to give lol) selling a life-extending law at affordable prices is ENSLAVEMENT and takes the freedom of the one that would of need DEAD if it was not for you. Then no one will ever make medicine that extends cancer patients lives. Not only that but the cancer scientist will close his factory!!! Since it is costing money and even if he gave up his pattern copyright whatever of the medicine, no one would produce it, because selling it is illegal because it enslave the people (that by now are dead coz the factory closed and at this point i guess we can call the cancer scientist a murderer as well, since the new people relied on the medicine). You end up in a world where cancer medicine is known, but not produced!!!!!! And if you ask those patients would cancer, 'hey there, you need this medicine and it is cheap enough for you that you can live a normal life that you would not have otherwise, BUT!! since under OUR DEFINITION of freedom, we do not want you to be enslaved, so we will basically destroy the incentive to produce the medicine you need. Destroy the incentive so badly, that even when the formula is known, no one will make it.

Also, the medicine is so complex that the average guy would not be able to produce it at home alone sufficiently and affordable for himself let alone for friends. And since technology improves when mainly companies try to advance their production, even single unit tools to.make things yourself will not improve.

Next question!!! I'm slaughtering these like minced meat lol........or maybe I'm getting cocky. Lol but I'm pretty sure i hit the nail in the head here.

You see what happens when u try to mess with the definition of freedom.

This man in your example would be free, less he is dead. (Because he now lives a normal life playing witcher 3, watching porn, fucking chicks and eating chocolate!!! And all he has to do is go to work forever, LIKE WE ALL DO. By the way even rich people have to work or they will lose their wealth. Also, he could become an entrepreneur and make passive income eventually. After all, he has HIS WHOLE FREEEEEEEE LIFE AHEAD OF HIM)."
PoliticalPhilosophy,f8t4mwe,t1_f8sy5yh,1574795697.0,"Fair enough. I am not trying to derail either. I will only answer your questions and let you reply with the more focused and precise request as it goes. You hold the steering wheel of the convo.

Freedom from physical harm and Coercion. Coercion is when physical harm is not done, nor implied, but would logically follow. - (no other definition of freedom can be possible, without an infringement in the freedom of others) this is the only kind NATURALLY possible. (If you have something to counter this part, please do, as I want to test if I can defend it, as no one has been able to refute this o far)

Government is to only ensure no coercion or physical harm. And if done so, to provide courts of justice to penalise those that break this law. This includes emergency services. Basically, in layman's terms, the government is tasked with the PREVENTION of all forms of physical harm (but not cure).

With regards to what extent limiting freedoms is ok, if at all. I will use your disease example to explain. Freedom (as i defined) can never, at all be adjusted. You can not be half pregnant. You either are free or not. Either are pregnant or not. The second any form of coercion or physic force is used on you, then your freedom has been lost (and you really never had, since it was possible in the end. Basically, you had been living under coercion and reached the final level). (I don't know why this is in big don't size) 
-----
If the government wanted to defend against a chemical attack, then PREVENTION is the only possible course. BUT NO FORCE OR PHYSICAL HARM.  The government must prevent without force. (Interestingly enough, i think this is what the difference between propaganda and advertising is. The ability to critique or go against, without fear of corrosion. Without fear of physical violence. What do u think about this??? I'm going off the track here sorry). Basically, the government must inform people of the disease. (But to be honest, private markets do these things automatically. Supply and demand). If this does not answer the diseased part, please be more specific what you mean. 

The only compromise permitted by the individual is none (with regards to my def of freedom). The individual will be able to even defend themselves with weapons against government too if they try to break that individuals freedom and the individual can go to court and get that officer in jail for breaking that law. Both the government and individual must accept that VOLUNTARY cooperation can not be compromised. (Unless government suspects someone of having committed a crime, then they may arrest, without causing physical harm.

If there is to be any form of compromise, it must be voluntary.

Lol there! Much more constructive and well thought out. Lol thanks man. This would have been better in the blog lol. So, hit me!!!! (No harm) what are your next questions? Lol"
PoliticalPhilosophy,f8s69ya,t1_f8s2rix,1574770955.0,"I did not say because of member quantity (with regards to kkk) but the positions they held. They were lawmakers and so on. Also i am against all forms of crowds right or left. But with regards to anti being anti-facist........have u ever read animal farm and 1984??? Any group that gives themselves a loving name, is trying to hide something. Antifa is extreme in their behaviour and violence. Just because it is not comparable to kkk, does not mean it is not extreme. 

However, i have nothing against extremism. Extremism is a measurement level. If you are extreme in terms of defending your finally home from invaders, that is only natural. But if you are extreme in the form that you think you have the rights to invade peoples homes and tell them what to do, then that is a negative extreme.

By the way, i am aware the blog itself was self indulging and assuming. That is a problem on my behalf. I rushed it and it was mainly address to objectivity. I shared this post with objectivity and they understood it. But they did mention i should not write assuming, even if they understood me. Something i have learnt. So yeah with regards to that, it is more of a target audience issue. However, wince this was a philosophy section, I ASSUMED. LOL so u r right about that. I am sorry.my goal is not to win arguments but to learn and spread good ideas. 

Milton Friedman is the economical aspect of what i tried to say but failed. (My fault). But any rand is the philosophical basis of my argument of culture and how economy links with government and individuals. 


I am not sure if i addressed everything, but with regards to you saying it says a lot about me and that i am fixed in my views. In life, there is such thing as absolute. There are only 2 genders. Collectivism does lower freedoms of individuals. Whether that is fascism or communism or what ever. There is no grey. If there is grey, it is only because we need to undo the damage already done slowly, since humans are creatures of habit. Protection from violence and harm is an absolute. It is called defence. That is why i agree with the rights to bare arms. Because it is a way of relying less on government. Also justice and law comes under objective enforcement of defend and protect policy. Whether regarding property or people. 

I am extreme in the defence of the individual against any collective, be it kkk, antics, communism, fascism and so on.

By the way, i have relatives that lived through communism in Yugoslavia and Albania and lived through fascism in Greece. I have living evidence of these things. And my family were in high positions, such as spy and navy. So views from peasant and lord perspective of living breathing people. There is such thing as absolute. SOCIALISM UNDER THE BANNER OF COMMUNISM OR FASCISM, IS WRONG AND DESTROYS FREEDOM. The reason i am fixed is because the elders in my family told us how it starts. It starts with a kkk or an innocent seeming antifa. Living evidence from 3 countries and from 2 of them being good and bad communist country. (Since for some reason, people think Yugoslavia was a socialist haven.)"
PoliticalPhilosophy,f8piwut,t1_f8o9x6l,1574702267.0,"Hey, sure.

Regarding the kkk comment. I did state that their violence is not comparable. However, i also stated that the only reason it is not is that Antifa does not have as many members that are in high positions in life. But i did state that in terms of violence they are not the same.

Government is necessary. I am not an anarchist. I am practical. However, big government has no purpose!!!!! Governments only job should be to protect us from one another and protect us from external enemies. The evidence (results) throughout the history of government doing anything altruistic or benevolent in anyways has always failed, made things worse and cost way above what any sane deal makers would accept. I do understand this part may be particularly confusing, so I recommend you look at just 1 lecture by Milton Friedman. The man explains it perfectly.

Regarding the tech company point. Throughout history (again watch Milton Friedman, you will thank me later, the guy is an economic genius) any time the private sector has done harm, is because there was a government branch, law or something that they could bribe and influence. So if it did not exist, that harm would not occur. (You can not blame people for always trying to win).

I will end it with this. In America, you guys realised the importance of the separation of church and state. Now is time for the separation of economy and state. The only thing our money should go to is police and military (emergency things like firefighters and ambulance) but once the threat to life or physical harm is dealt with, they should not get involved (such as paying for doctors and medications). -----i do realise the comments that might arise that health care is expensive, but that is only because the government holds a monopoly of how many people can become doctors. Again Milton will explain this too. (By the way, please reply after you have watched it. It won't take long and it will only help you understand basic economics and freedom better. And let me know wa you think.

PoliticalPhilosophy,f8iy2h1,t1_f8iue6a,1574593932.0,"Not necessarily. I am neither right nor left. I am an Objectivist. Conservatives and socialists are opposites of the same coin. For example l, left want to take guns and right want to take away women rights to abortion. I think government should mind its own business. But the specific recent case I am making is, that just like military companies sponsor their candidates, in today's world, tech companies are a new type of sponsor.

I do not vote by party, but by policy. The party (promising) more freedom and less government is what I will vote for. I gave the example of Mccarthyism being conservatives doing what the left is doing today. I vote against big government, whether it is against conservatives or liberals. But it just so happens in today's age, the game of McCarthyism is being played by the liberals. In the past conservatives had KKK to threaten with, in today's world the left has antics. Granted these can not be compared, as what the kkk did was much worse, but only because they had more power, not because Antifa is moral.

Also regarding right-leaning governments being in power. In democracies, power is not absolute. Secondly, throne or title turning right does not mean it is really conservative, but a modern version of it. Remember, the goal is freedom, not right or left.

Also to state something, my grandparents come from 2 types of governments. One side communist, the other fascist. They told me how both start and how they are the same thing and people must fight it before the symptoms, as the symptoms make it viral. I am against both sides. But I am just aware of the trend and resistance to it long before other people, because of what my grandparent told me. Also on the communist side, my grandparents worked for the spy agency and the fascist side navy. So my family did not suffer, but instead went against it with their positions. 

Look, chef can tell what a dish is, just by looking at the ingredients, even before it is made. My mistake is saying in the intro, what the dish is going to be, without explaining why and how.  I will make sure future posts are more specific. It is just that I am use to talking with my grandparents and just assumed others kind of understood what they did, since it is sooooo obvious. But maybe that is only because of hindsight.

Please also if you can reply with advise on how I can fix my main weaknesses, would really appreciate it. My goal is to inform, not win. So I appreciate all helps!!!"
PoliticalPhilosophy,f8iuqvd,t1_f8iitk7,1574592827.0,"I agree with what your saying 100%. But maybe if I state the background of that answer here more specifically. As I plan to answer these questions more specifically in a future post, I am trying to not just explain them here. Remember, this post is called WELCOME TO NOTEBOOK OF THINKERS. I am not trying to address anything directly in it and my assumption of you being left is only because I could not understand how you did not notice it was an introductory post and was purposely not intended to be too specific. 

Anyways, I just want to say thank you. It is my fault. The truth is we should always write, as to leave no holes to be filled by assumptions that we think people already have. When I normally write, I ensure clarity. But as I thought it was only an introduction and did not want to waste too much time. Instead, I was looking to get some tips on the topics at hand rather than my argument for them, as I intend to address everything separately in their own posts. But I do appreciate this. Thanks. 

May I ask, to what depth must an introduction swim in explanation? This would be very helpful if you answered. I intend to make my website address complex aspects of human behaviour and society. Thanks again"
PoliticalPhilosophy,f8idiiq,t1_f8hkjsr,1574587396.0,"The art of warfare always changes. To say a country never invades another country because men do not cross their territorial air or land space is silly. Just because drones do the killings, does not mean it is not an invasion. 

My point with the first paragraph is to state that political censorship in the west is not enforced with bullets like in North Korea, but a psychological manipulation of the crowd. This is a new type of warfare, especially with internet censorship and so on. 

For those who understand, no explanation is needed. For those that do not want to understand, no explanation will do. The only way I can assume you do not understand the post is that you must be left-leaning in your politics. (However, I am not saying only the left does this kind of thing. McCarthyism was the right doing to the left, what the left is doing to the right today).

Also, the last thing I want to say, I have deliberately left out actual examples of what I mean, because I want to show to those who see it, not to teach the blind.  Teaching the blind to see, is fruitless. Not because the blind is bad, just because there is no way. This is why drug dealers try to create addicts in first-time drug takers. They know that they won't come out of it, without great cost.

Hope that answers your question. Please let me know if there is anything else :)"
