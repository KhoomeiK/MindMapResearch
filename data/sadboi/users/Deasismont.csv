I technically could've met her, but I'd feel bad (she was in the hospital, got in about 2 weeks after we entered the relationship) since I didn't know her or anything about her, or much about my partner's family in general. I wouldn't fit in and I don't think I would be able to be there either. :(

WhitePeopleTwitter,fg5y70n,t1_fg5btxl,1580544065.0,"I don't entirely understand your question?
Also I don't understand much about the diagnoses, or anything else for that matter. I've been too horrible at paying attention, and taking in information, my entire life so it is my parents (mainly mum) who got the information. I've also had the problem that no one seems to care to make sure I understand fully. I need very clear instructions etc to understand the simplest thing. I have been trying to look up information on my own to try and get on at least a higher level to understand what is happening and why.

I am only 20 by now and still don't understand much and pretty much act like child (from my point of view at least) because I don't know any better because no one has helped me understand.

Anyways. The only answer I can give from what little I might have understood is one thing I've been told, and read, many times: ""Not everyone with ADHD has some kind of autism, but many diagnosed with autism also gets diagnosed with ADHD.""
That is all I know. It doesn't even seem like my doctors have decided if I have ADHD or ADD yet though...

The subject is just very sensitive for me because I have been bullied since age 4/5 because of it and everyone has been very insensitive about it and is joking about it when they don't understand how it affects a person's life.
I have finay been diagnosed with major depression so far, but it has been with me since age 12 I think, because of all the shit I have gone through because of my diagnoses and people not understanding nor caring to even try to either.
And everything has gone wrong with that too. People who were supposed to help and come to my school to explain for my classmates, but they kept postponing it and things like that never happened. Same with help in school, they promised this and that but nothing ever happened.

Sorry for the life story, but yeah.
If anything is done/written wrong or I have misspelled it I blame that I am from Sweden."

It's only at about lunch I go out to meet my partner (who goes first year uni) to eat. I go around in my PJ's all day some days. I went like that for a total of 4 or 5 days rather recently, but since we live with his parents I feel embarrassed and like they are judging me which both makes me stay even more in our room and helps me push myself to get dressed and shower (just came out of one actually).

I'm happy for you that you are getting help, and I know it sucks that it takes so long, but i believe in you, that you can make it. Everyone in this subreddit is able to get through this. (My partner was the most happy and positive person I ever met and it rubbed off a bit on me from being the most pessimistic person ever, still stryggle, but I try). My psychiatrist tell me over and over that it will take time, but, IT IS WORTH IT. Keep fighting, keep pushing yourself to do the smallest things.
I've tried to make myself a little achievement thing like I get a star or something in a notebook if I brushed my teeth or got out of bed, ate at least 2 meals a day etc. Gotta celebrate the small things and it feels like it's worth it.

I recognise the not leaving bed unless you *really* have to, and also with the taking a shift when you felt okay and really regretting it (summerjob that was HORROBLE as it was). It's going to be okay. Just don't push or judge yourself too hard for it.

But with my current boyfriend I had had a crush on him for 2 years and been mistreated enough and was so depressed etc I felt ""how could it get worse"" and started talking to him and some others, got friends, hung out with him, he taught me Magic The Gathering and we hung out several hours every day for a month and even went on a date before I finally dared to enter his home, lied on his chest and cuddled for about 3 hours before he asked me ""Will you be my girlfriend?"" And we have been together for 1+year now and he is the best I've ever had, thr nicest person I've ever met  most patient.
I just feel bad with my depression which causes me to be down pretty much all the time and extremely irritable...

So, my word of wisdom to you is to get to know whomever you have a crush on before getting into the relationship. It is better to be sad alone then jumping into relationships unknowingly and probably get mistreated and used...

These are just a few examples from the top of my head and are in a way physical, at least IMO, but people just don't pay attention and if they notice it they don't make the connection, ignore it or simply don't care."
