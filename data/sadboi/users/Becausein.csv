Been inching myself towards holding myself accountable of if/when I have the energy to check my phone then I owe them something even if it's just a ""I'll watch that later"" or ""I'll respond another day"".  

The first checkpoint I remember was when I got ahold of when I had the energy to read what they said, then I would say something back.

Caring is exhausting but to be fair caring conceptually can be enough to get us there sometimes"

When it ironically drags someone down with us and we're aware of it that should call for a modification to our behavior, so you're on to something, but a complete overhaul would be wrong imo or at least unnecessary."

AmItheAsshole,fjwtner,t3_fes4eh,1583645577.0,"NTA.  I had a buddy who a girl did this to, including covering it up with a fake miscarriage.  It not only put my friend through heavy unnecessary emotions, thoughts and stress, but it got him un-organically attached to the idea of being a Dad plus a normalized perspective of her being his kid's mom.  So they broke up for a while because they were mostly trying to make it work for the baby, and when they got back together they tried and had a kid, but separated again before he even came.  She blurted out the whole first pregnancy and miscarriage was a lie during an argument.  A few years later they fight like cats and dogs and are on and off again more than Ross and Rachel.  The kid is pretty chill but he has to hear them yell and talk mad shit as I bet he always will, and goes weeks without even seeing his father sometimes, even though she admits he is a great Dad, because she is so bipolar and controlling.  He regrets getting back together with her.  If one of her sisters or friends would have told him about the lie sooner I believe they'd both be happier right now.  Even if it was half by accident, you did the right thing and that guy has more reason to be thankful than your sister does to be upset.  Your sister is the asshole, not you.  Text him back unapologetically.  The truth is better without tact than too late."
