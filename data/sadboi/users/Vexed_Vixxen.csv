ptsd,f4xgs4t,t3_dm5ppj,1571865487.0,"Something triggers your anxiety, and it will eventually trigger the attack you have to figure out what the trigger is and figure out a way to reduce it. I use to have panic attack multiple times a day and I'm down to one every month or two. Seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist has helped me do much with this issue. I hope you are able to find your trigger and reduce your anxiety. Panic attacks are the worst. Stay strong! -hugs-"
