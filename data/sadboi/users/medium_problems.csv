KeeperoftheLostCities,fpyaezs,t3_gg5yh3,1588999717.0,That is very interesting. I wonder if it's actually showing insights into their characters or just happened to be how their stories went. Like fitz's was also kinda about biana if I recall (it's been a bit since I read them)

TeensMeetTeens,fo79wmz,t3_g62544,1587574741.0,What do you like to read?
KeeperoftheLostCities,fo79qpq,t3_g4fgqk,1587574662.0,yeah Nightfall and Flashback. Even tho I (do? did?) ship fitzphie it was just almost no plot compared to earlier books at least
KeeperoftheLostCities,fo5ksgf,t3_g5sjdc,1587528099.0,"That Blur is Jensi's brother. Blur's a Phaser, Jensi's brother is a Phaser. Blur looked familiar when his Phase was weakened by water. Maybe he looked like Jensi so he looked familiar.

descriptions of Jensi:

He was a couple of inches shorter than her, with messy brown hair and a very round face. Page 165, Keeper of the Lost Cities

""though I’d kinda been rooting for Phaser—like my brother—"" Page 421, Lodestar

and Blur: 

“It’s a little drier,” Blur said. His outline was becoming clearer as the cold spray spritzed him again and again. He was skinnier than Sophie had imagined, and shorter too, but he kept his face turned away, hiding his features. Page 282, Nightfall

“Go for servitude,” Blur told her, right before a huge wave hit the prow and drenched him head to toe. For the briefest moment, his features were outlined by the water—and while Sophie didn’t recognize him, his full lips and round cheeks felt strangely familiar. Page 289, Nightfall

so yeah"

TeensRateMe,fnxpk62,t3_g4hguj,1587343625.0,"Honestly I think just time. You don't look like a *ugly* 12 year old lol so I don't think there's really anything you can do but wait for your face to mature. And you look older in some pics than others, if I had to guess I'd probably guess you were 13. But yeah, you have nice hair and stuff so I wouldn't worry"
