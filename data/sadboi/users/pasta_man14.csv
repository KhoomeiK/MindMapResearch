So satisfying to win a match now, cause I feel like there is more team work involved, instead of our farmed mid ember carry us to a 20min win

Before you say its hard for supps, i exclusively play pos 4 or 5 on SEA on top of that. Its hard yes. But so worth it to play. 
I like the new changes. gl"

learndota2,fl0bifo,t3_fls2kw,1584700127.0,"positions are how farm is prioritized withing teams, with position 5 being the least prioritized with position 4 following after. 


So this means generally if you are a hard support(5) you will have less gold, thus buying thing like force staff, glimmer cape, smokes and also ALOT of sentry wards(Observers don't matter cause they are free)


Position 4 will also buy wards and other more ""expensive"" support items, example would be pipe or Vladimir's, Lotus orb and even aghanim if it helps the game.


But what I consider the biggest difference is gameplay between the two supports.

pos 5 will majority of the time babysit the position 1 and make sure he has a good start, the game is highly dependent on how well you take care of your pos 1, in my opinion pos 5 takes a lot of responsibility to play you have to be selfless for you team.

position 4 are the roamers who setup kills in the early to mid game, roaming most likely when it turns into night time and just rasing hell with pos 3 and 2. You eventually transition into a core in the late game.

Anything else you need just ask."

he's gonna be taking of very little hp to use buring spears when he's very low; huskar is the most dangerous when he's mid-low health, so when he  uses burning spears initially he'll hurt himself alot(what every huskar player wants) but when he gets low enough (below 10%) burning spears will do tickle damage and I'd like to see you kill a huskar when he's that low with decent items(and get out alive) 
-buff to jungle is good
-buff to sange and halberd makes him a beast
-armlet nerf broke his balls tho
damn sure we'll see this in a pro game fucking shit up"
