About a year ago while playing NTW DM as Ireland, I had three full stack armies departing from Hungary to Romania and left about half an army‚Äôs worth of units (almost all infantry with one howitzer) to defend the fortified area.
Well, one army had to come back due to suffering heavy casualties and also being used as reinforcing units for my better 2 armies. Had to put them in the city to heal when, all of a sudden, 3 full elite Austrian (I allied with France) armies marched out of the fog of war and were heading towards my city. So I rallied the half army and sent them out to hopefully hold them off long enough to get my main forces back.

I didn‚Äôt auto-resolve, since we all know that mechanic is ASS unless you outnumber them 3-1, and resolved to fight them to the last. Key words were ‚ÄúI resolved‚Äù

My men fought well until the third army entered the field and I had advanced too far and taken too many casualties to hold them off. Their cavalry decimated what was left of the regiments and they broke almost instantly. It was a hard fought defeat, but I was still expecting better. I have learned since then that cavalry in DM is far more important than in vanilla. 

Side note: in NTW3 you are almost required to have at least two cav/army so you can actually find the enemy army/armies and observe their troop movements."
