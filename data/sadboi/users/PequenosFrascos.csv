Nope, you are not! (you may need to isolate yourself a bit, but you totally can handle it.)

yes, there's a lot of sexual crimes going on daily, and a lot of people who think about but don't act on it...

A bad person, who is able to hurt someone, wouldn't be here talking about this. You have a problem but you're not a bad person. you just have to accept the problem you have, understand it and realize you have to control it daily.

Like any other disease, I have diabetes, I have to think about what I eat, and take my medicine EVERY SINGLE DAY, till my death. Good luck in your journey.

You may be able to change yourself somehow, but you'll never be able to run from yourself, so, make peace, accept the reality, take precautions and keep walking."
