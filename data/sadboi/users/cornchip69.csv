It seems like the problem here is your depression and self esteem is the real problem here.

It doesnt make sense to me now, but at that time, he did and said a lot of stuff that made me in some way believe that I am worthless and he is someone sent from the above to be with me. At the same time, every time I tried to leave he threated me with suicide, and even tho I knew he never had balls enough to do it, I didnt want to be the reason someone takes their own life «just in case»."

Maybe he hoped that since Greg treats women bad, that if he changes his gender he will be treated better. Or he suffered extreme depersonalization which made him believe that he now is a guy. I think its all just a coping mechanism to try to survive all of the abuse. Leaving a toxic relationship, ESPECIALLY if there are children involved is extremly difficult, so I can see why it is taking him ages."
