depression,fkgae8p,t3_fiahxu,1584154077.0,"Looking at where the deaths are actually occurring out of the top 5 for infectees and deaths, they do all share something in common and that's a poor sewage management. Now if the cases rise in Italy for example at the same rate that has been appearing over the past 2 days, which has been around 2000+, then there could be a distinct connection, it's known that Italy's ""roads"" in Venice are shared with their sewage treatment/management. It could be technically used for bacteria viruses etc to be channeled through to regions where it may not have travelled before. It may be a cause or it may not be but it definitely seems suspicious and as the virus is relatively new, no one has information only guidance so logic assumptions is the best course of action for All, as delegated by most head of countries. So on the basis of that, you could be correct in thinking poor individual management of sanitation is the cause. In Italy's case and other countries where they have poor management of human product, it definitely seems apparent so far"

Being as honest as you can towards these people is the best policy ie. Telling them they're a cunt (or words to that extent) because they will do it again if they've done it once to someone else most likely because they have that cuntishness about them

Its made people, especially women, think they can get better than what can have, so as a result you have alot of males depressed and wanting to commit suicide because they question their integrity and their stance as a male, after all, males were always looked on as leaders hisorically. 

Its tragic that this generation has been caught up in an obsessive revolution of overall equality when everything should have been neutral from the beginning, equality for all etc. 

Also, why do the majority sound like they come from a place full of cunts when the majority of them live anywhere between 30 to 330 miles away from cundon? 

Roll back pre 2004 when none of this bollocks never existed and we just had google, ask jeeves, yahoo email and the ability to research whatever we wanted, rather than making our minds numb and become a dark calderon of negativity and ridiculous questions because someone slightly younger is doing better because they had a fantastic start via their own support network. ($) This highway and 'convinence' of having all this information in a matter of moments can really affect some people, probably as much as mindblowing. 

If you cant roll back to a time whenever none of this bragging material ever existed then do the next best thing and commit suicide (not endorsing, sarcastic) I will be doing this soon because there is morality left its all selfishness and greed and this is profounded on a daily basis through various events.
