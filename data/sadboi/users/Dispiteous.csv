If there is an interaction between two drugs, most of the time they are competing for the same enzyme in your body that metabolises them. The other drug leads to a slower metabolism of finasteride in your body, so there is a higher serum fin concentration and thus higher risk of side effects. You should definitely lower the dosage of fin, try 0,5mg or even 0,2mg. If you have still sides you have to stop using fin. Also please speak with your doctor about the interaction.

The thing is, that I have a pharmacy degree and know what happens to your body when you take meds, especially hormone influencing ones. Even if you do not notice side effects, there are **always** effects that influence your body functions. Even if you do not get aging skin or heart racing from minoxidil, it still changes your blood pressure and after a long time of usage I am sure also your skin. And your libido, your strength or other androgene influencing body properties from fin? Although you might not notice them instantly, if one would be able to compare your pre-fin-self with your post-fin-self, there are definitely differences, some people notice even the slightest changes and some don't.

I dermaroll (1,5mm) every 5th or 6th day, it really depends on how I feel my head has healed and I have mixed 3 oil mixtures that I apply on different days. 

- One for directly after microneedling (no peppermint and tea tree because it's painful (1/2 castor + 1/2 pumpkin seed oil + 5 drops rosemary) 
- one for 1-2 days after microneedling (castor, pumpkin seed, rosemary, (you can but no must + coconut) + 5 drops tea tree + 5 drops peppermint) 
- and one for 3-4 days after microneedling (equal parts of all the oils).

Also I am trying Zix once per day and it feels great in my hair (great cosmetic effect and in vitro studies show a 5AR inhibitory effect.)

A few days ago I additionaly started using topical melatonin, applying it before going to bed.

It is quite a drastic ""natural"" treatment and I am not sure if it is all good what I am doing, but I will know more in a few months. For now I feel like I am slightly shedding but on the other side it looks like new and more hairs are growing instead. Could be my imagination but we'll see ;)"

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3681103/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3681103/)

If you don't want to read the whole thing, here is the last paragraph of the discussion:

*In summary, it can be stated that multiple studies with different study designs observed mostly positive effects resulting from the topical application of a cosmetic melatonin solution in women and men with early-stage AGA (Phase I and II, Hamilton and Ludwig scales, respectively) or general hair loss with a partial reduction in hair loss, as well as new hair growth in some cases. Although the mechanism of action has not yet been clarified in detail, it appears highly likely that it is based on a melatonin receptor-mediated antiandrogenic effect and/or an antioxidative effect. Due to the fact that the application of the melatonin solution has been shown to be very well tolerated in a total of 5 studies and because positive effects on hair growth were observed in the before-and-after comparisons, the cosmetic melatonin solution represents a possible option for delaying hair aging, hair loss in general, and for the treatment of early-stage AGA in men and women.*"
