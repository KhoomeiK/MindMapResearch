BPD,fj4pw3v,t3_fb65pb,1583014045.0,"I’m starting to become convinced I don’t have bpd but more cptsd based on the fact that my bpd seemed to get worse when i tried doing dbt and responded better once I did started doing trauma based mindfulness and inner child work/started doing what my trauma therapist normally does for ptsd instead of treating me as a “typical bpd” pt. 

Still uncertain as to what this means but 🤷‍♀️

It’s really interesting to me the cross over that CPTSD and BPD have and the seemingly lack of response from the psych community it seems to have in diagnosing. I’m sure it’s bc CPTSD is a newer term and hopefully we’ll see some developments within the next few years. 

Hopefully your new diagnosis brings you some peace? I’m sorry you’ve had to most likely go through the ringer when it comes to treatments/therapies and the like. Sending you good luck in the future and fair winds ♥️"
BPD,fj4o7sx,t3_fbj6md,1583012888.0,"1. i’m sorry she said this to you. but just bc she said this to you doesn’t necessarily mean she will leave you or that she doesn’t care. people can say things and not mean them/say things carelessly/say things and have them be a projection etc. are you able to ask for more clarification? 

2. are you able to speak with a therapist/parent/trusted friend for support to help calm down? you need validation and support from someone asap. i’m sure people on the internet help but it sounds like you could benefit from someone irl too. 

3. try to just take some deep breaths and focus on the present. i don’t mean to sound like a trite assh*le but mindfulness has helped me a ton w my bpd. try to just not focus on anything and just breathe. play a game that can distract you, pet a fur baby, watch a show anything to take your mind away from this and just be somewhat present without doing anything harmful/rash. 

4. no matter what happens with this person know that your life and it’s meaning are bigger than this relationship. the idea of being left and abandonment are terrifying and i know that that part of bpd is fcking awful but you on you own are strong even if you don’t feel like it. 

5. i hope this helps. i’m thinking of you and sending you well wishes wherever you are. don’t shame yourself for feeling like you need a person or being afraid or panicking, it’s natural and normal even outside of bpd. but just know that you’re ok and strong on your own too."

astrology,fi71lmi,t1_fi67r2v,1582212366.0,"This is an asteroid placement and honestly not something I’m too familiar with! I’m gonna have to do some more research. Seems intriguing. Wish I had an answer for you. Maybe some googling/under ground digging can help you? 

I’m curious myself now & gonna find out more info about my own placement 🧐"
astrology,fi5qap5,t3_f6iks3,1582168396.0,"In my opinion beauty is in the eye of the beholder. As you read through the comments you can see quite a variety of opinion here. 

A good thing to keep in mind is whatever else lives in the first house and how it can mesh together. For example I have a lot of “traditional” “ good looking”placements in my first house, but they run amuck with my jupiter asc being the closest as it can cause excess weight gain and I also have a uranus in the first so I am probably “good looking” but strange as well. Just some things to consider. It’s all a blend and other placements should always be considered. 

However some “traditional” good looks or striking features would be as follows 

1. Mercury asc wouldn’t necessarily correlate with physical attractiveness but mental wit/good w words charismatic etc. 

2. Neptune asc is associated w physical attractiveness/mystique an ability to shift into whatever people want you to be. This is both good and bad as people can project ideals onto you. Lots of famous people have this placement. Think Marilyn Monroe. 

3. Anything ruled by Venus is going to be aesthetically pleasing typically so aspects/libra etc. 

4. A Lilith in first house will make a woman appear very physically attractive and dark, think goth hot or just more mysterious. Usually very steamy presence. 

In all reality we could go on about this for days, there are tons of aspects that rule physical vitality, mental dexterity, uniqueness, charisma, looks, its your pick. It all just depends on what OP and others would deem “attractive”. There are so many extraordinary possibilities and combinations from astrology that lead way to different talents/looks etc that are shown in charts. 

To try to just limit it to one post is nearly impossible. If you’re asking for ones self I’d recommend looking at your chart online and analyzing in depth there and doing as much research as possible. 

Or, if you are curious about others a fun game I like to play as the more I learn about astrology is guessing in my head what placements others may have as I meet them and pass them by/befriend them over time. Great way to think about things and eventually test your skills! 

Hopefully this helps and didn’t entirely put anyone to sleep. Cheers!"
astrology,fgo2u3h,t3_ezk483,1580958472.0,"Aqua sun, virgo moon, cap rising, i sometimes have an internal monologue-if I do it’s mostly in the form of when I have an intrusive thought, am typing, reading etc. Otherwise I mostly maladaptive day dream or think in abstract concepts or my mind is just processing info. 

I do not have the actual inner monologue that others seem to describe-like hearing their own thoughts and conversing with themselves 24/7. I never realized this was a thing until movies/other ppl described it as such. I do better with this if i verbalize out loud if necessary-its easier to hear myself talk, which I do somewhat frequently."

capricorns,fge9q4d,t3_exyfn8,1580694609.0,"i would say capricorn can make anything into a vice. caps work themselves to death and generally hate themselves underneath everything so whatever is their poison of choice they’ll make their vice. every cap i’ve known is a work hard play hard type of person and loves either 

caffeine, drugs, alcohol, food, drinking, eating, smoking etc SOMETHING in excess to numb off whatever they don’t wanna deal with in a healthy way 

this is myself included i’m a cap stellium in the first house. (ask me how that goes lol) 

i think it’s just that in our nature we wanna really unwind to our detriment just like we generally work to our detriment. i can’t speak for all but this is what i have noticed in my personal experience myself as well as friends who are caps.

astrology,fg4f1hd,t1_fg4c998,1580502224.0,"i also am a capricorn mercury and your experience sounds similar to mine if i am interpreting it correctly. like you are thinking and interpreting others actions but you aren’t actually talking to yourself in full sentences in your head, but you do when you’re alone out loud? 

it sounds like your thought process and inner dialogue etc is more abstract in nature? if that’s what you’re describing that’s my inner monologue constantly. i’ve never been able to relate to these ppl actually thinking sentence by sentence. it sounds exhausting and strange. i talk to myself out loud alone frequently and i do maladaptive daydreaming a lot but that’s the closest i get."

CPTSD,f99qdij,t3_e4aza8,1575193840.0,"I have struggled w terrible fear, anxiety, and panic all my life. I’ve always thought it was GAD or typical panic attacks. Pretty recently I’ve started to realize my anxiety stems from my childhood and the abuse I’ve suffered. Since this I’ve started to approach my anxiety attacks differently. Instead of using logic when having an anxiety attack or typical methods that are employed by other diseases I’ve started to talk to myself like I’m a child when I’m feeling distressed. 

I’ve started to do this bc nearly all my triggers are based out of fear or worries that we’re created in childhood or based out of trauma. I’ve already noticed a significant difference in how it goes when employing this method. Without getting too in depth here-I’ve found that using inner child work has been dramatically helpful for me personally bc it is what has been the root cause of basically all my problems. 

My panic and fear has been hard wired into me bc of my abuser and my environment. It’s not something that can be treated for me using traditional methods which explains why they weren’t working. Now when I have a panic attack I patiently dismantle the issue w my inner child and don’t even try to look at it logically. I try to address myself like I’m having a temper tantrum and I just tell myself that I’m safe, I’m okay, my feelings are valid, and I remind myself of all the facts. My abuser is no longer here, etc. I distract myself with something simple and almost immediately my fear is gone. 

Before when I’d try to just move on and implement shame or other techniques using logic it didn’t work. Bc that’s how my abuser would try to invalidate my feelings. Therefore it would just heighten my feelings of anxiety and cause me to spiral. Whereas using nurturing and mothering techniques gives me quite the opposite effect. 

Sorry for this novel. 

But yes. I HIGHLY recommend if you are READY (key word) working w your inner child. If you feel like you are in a safe enough place mentally to really reflect on what you need and missed out on do it. If you are NOT ready focus on other things you can change."

But watch that, it starts fun then becomes sort of a drag/weird. Food starts to lose its taste and eating becomes more like a chore. Lol it’s weird to explain. But soda tastes different. It tastes like battery acid. Sweet stuff isn’t as appealing either. At least for me! Also make sure to drink lots of water as it can cause kidney problems if you don’t!

I have a Virgo moon and my mom verbally, emotionally, and sexually abused me as a kid. I am in no contact with her now. I’m still dealing w the repercussions of her actions as an adult.

I remember my favorite was when my mom did actually attempt to be present in my life and be a Girl Scout troop leader. She stole all the money from the group lol. 

It’s so hard feeling so alone and invisible. You’re not the only one who has felt this way and it’s a very real way to experience trauma. I didn’t realize it until I found this community and did a lot of research online. Neglect and instability are so commonly ignored when childhood abuse are discussed and they shouldn’t be. 

Another thing that you may want to research is the term “fawning or fawn” that sounds very similar to what you may have done to survive. It’s a coping strategy for dealing w trauma. I did it too.

After years of SSRIs and typical treatments for depression and anxiety nothing else has worked for me except a mood stabilizer. And all the symptoms and everything match me exactly.

I am working closing w my therapist to monitor my mood. I am currently on a mood stabilizer. I don’t know if upping the dose or lowering it will work :/ 

I think my biggest issue is I keep forgetting that my self hatred is taught and was ingrained in me. I also just keep comparing myself to others and forgetting my progress. 

I had a really beautiful moment happen w my friend tonight. We were driving home in separate cars and I started to have a panic attack on the highway when I pulled off. She pulled off behind me and I called her and apologized. She was understanding and was like that’s okay! 

We got home and I explained that this particular exit was just triggering for me and I usually take a different way home, that I chose to take this one as it was faster bc she was behind me following me. She said “no worries! You just don’t vibe w that exit!” And laughed and shrugged it off. Just like that. 

It hit me. There’s nothing wrong w that. I have been shaming myself for opting to take that alternate route home for MONTHS. I explained that to my friend and she was so confused. “They both get you home so who cares?” 

The fact that she was so accepting of me and it was so clear that it wasn’t a big deal made me realize that my self judgment and hatred the past two weeks are really just that simple. Everything could be compared to this exit. If I just don’t vibe with something it’s okay and that my choice DOES matter. It sounds so silly but this was such a big deal. 

Hopefully I continue feeling moderately better."
BPD,f8e2eb9,t3_e0h7hm,1574516836.0,"Agreed. Kudos to you for realizing this! Don’t beat yourself up for last night. It happens. Yeah I quit drinking like 6 months ago and it’s been huge for my recovery. If I had continued to drink I’m sure I would’ve ended up dead. I wouldn’t say I was an alcoholic but I just ended up getting so drunk when I would drink and I’d turn super depressive at the end of the night id almost always start contemplating suicide by the end of the night. I think anything that heightens our emotional state is bad news bears. 

It sucks though bc alcohol is such a nice temporary relaxant at least for me anyways. Le sigh. I do miss it. BUT. So not worth it. 

Best of luck to you friend. ❤️"

BPD,f8cyct7,t3_e08p84,1574472853.0,This is me too right now. I’m sorry. I don’t have the words to tell you how badly I wish I could make it go away for both of us.
CPTSD,f8cxugb,t1_f8cxadr,1574472428.0,We have a good relationship. That was my meaning.
astrology,f8cwghz,t3_e07z38,1574471299.0,"Venus in Pisces in 3rd house. I love either character driven indie movies that are romantic ala 500 days of summer, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, drinking buddies, or I love more gritty mind bending crime movies like pulp fiction, gone girl, inception, in bruges. 

I guess anything w a strong voice or anything stylized. I get lost when it’s a stereotypical action movie or something commercial that doesn’t seem original. 

As far as music goes I like a wide range! I can go from Shawn Mendes to queens of the Stone Age to Tyler the creator to violent femmes to hozier. It all really depends. As long as it makes me feel something I like it. 

Maybe that’s the common theme? As long as it makes me feel something I’m down w it. 🤷🏻‍♀️"

CPTSD,f8cbmvu,t3_e05g98,1574456852.0,Be proud of yourself that you reached out for help. I’m glad that your therapist followed up w you. But seriously awesome job taking care of yourself-that’s no small feat. Pat yourself on the back. Sending you lots of compassion during your hard time. ❤️
CPTSD,f8bx5nt,t3_e031gq,1574447366.0,Amazing. Thank you. I’m sorry you’ve experienced this too.

witchcraft,f878p3f,t3_dzbici,1574320698.0,"I agree w the earlier comments. The more research you do the more you’ll find that the church and paganism have roots tied pretty tightly together despite what they’d like you to believe. 

A lot of the rituals and things that are done are pagan in nature it’s just that they’re labeled as catholic etc. I believe you should find what works for you so long as you’re not hurting anyone or disrespecting others beliefs publicly. There are plenty of people who work w Christian saints/deities in their practice so I’m sure you can work that into your worship. 

You could also look into more of the kitchen witch, green witch types of magic which involve more practical and maybe more homey types of magic which may seem potentially less pagan in nature to you? Do research and see what fits with your beliefs, it’s all dependent on the individual. 

Again much of the what the churches practice now are in fact stolen from paganism is my understanding so...it’s silly to even consider not integrating them so long as your intentions are good which of course they seem like they are :) 

Good fortune to you! ✨

Edit-I realize stolen may seem like a harsh term. I mean to say borrowed, or influenced by etc. I do not mean to belittle your beliefs in any way."

CPTSD,f85cx9f,t3_dz55mv,1574272582.0,"My mom was right about so many things but she was wrong about a lot of things too. It doesn’t change the fact that she’s a fucked up person who destroyed me and doesn’t deserve to be in my life. Your feelings about loving her/hating her/being angry at her/knowing she’s right/hating her for it are all valid. Don’t punish yourself or feel guilty about any of it. Be gentle w yourself. So many things in life are varying shades of gray. Nothing is black and white. 

Try to focus on your present and how you feel and how to take care of you in the ways your mother couldn’t. You are the most important thing. Be gentle w yourself. That’s my advice to you."

Usually means healing after a difficult decision, calmer waters, escaping, a journey, you may be tired, a spirit guide etc.

CPTSD,f842rht,t3_dytnsj,1574228625.0,You are valid. Your feelings are valid. You don’t have to get over them or put them away. You existing and being here is enough.

CPTSD,f82znhs,t1_f82w6r0,1574201322.0,"Thank you so much. I’m just starting to feel this way after 6 months of therapy and being sober/not dating anyone/lots of sustained alone time. It hasn’t been easy at all. This also comes after a particularly rough weekend. I really hope you come to find it gets easier too. Positive affirmations help me so much (telling myself repeatedly I’m safe, I’m proud of myself-for any task even the smallest most menial, self soothing is a big one) tools for grounding like lotion, gum, chapstick and always having those on hand for panic attacks has helped for making me feel safe too. 
 Maybe those things can help you as well. 
Wishing you peace ♥️"

https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/maladaptive-daydreaming

Super common especially with people who’ve experienced trauma. Probably bc we didn’t get a lot of emotional support."
tarot,f81z1ah,t3_dyl0w9,1574180468.0,You may feel a lack of direction or perhaps be overworking yourself depending on what you’re doing. This could be effecting your sleep habits or keeping you up at night. Make sure you are also not ruminating on anything unnecessarily. Or ignoring what’s in front of you/overlooking your options by overthinking. All of the cards suggest to me that you are potentially having difficulty making a decision or going in a direction perhaps? Again I’m thinking this may be effecting your sleep quality. But the good news is that the last card suggests that this is going to change soon and you’ll soon make a decision that is going to change for the better and you’ll start moving in a new direction towards healing or traveling. A journey of some sort.
CPTSD,f81xcxf,t1_f81w5of,1574179425.0,Thank you so much 🥺 I know it’s just a feeling so it won’t last but I hope at least w me posting this when I feel shitty I can reread it and assure myself that it’s all worth it ya know?
