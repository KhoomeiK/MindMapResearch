I actually failed one semester stubbornly pushed myself for another semester and failed again and then went a 3rd semester and withdrew midway and luckily, due to academic forgiveness policy I will be able to apply to drop the two horrible semesters next year which means my GPA will skyrocket! You might want to see if your school offers the same thing <3

Also financial aid forgiveness is a thing you can apply for as well. You basically fill out a form and write a letter saying why you failed and what you’ve done to make sure it doesn’t happen again and they put you on probation."

When I tell him I’m having a low point he...Idunno how to say this without sounding like an ungrateful asshole...but he cares too much? He tries to draw me baths and make me tea and snuggle me and he wants to fix it and make me laugh and I feel worse because I want it to be that easy, I want his love to be enough and I don’t want to tell him it’s not and then I have to ‘be okay’ and I’m not ready....and if I tell him THAT he worries and he watches me like at any moment I’ll break down and I hate that...I hate being fragile. I hate being not okay......I hate that I just can’t decide to not want to stop existing...."
