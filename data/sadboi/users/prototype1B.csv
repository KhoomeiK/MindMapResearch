My girl is from show lines but I will say shes the easiest dog I've ever had. Her breeder didnt put much focus on sports anymore, mostly confo (she's old). Plenty of drive for sports but also content to chill in the house whenever. The confo breeders who focus on sports will have dogs much higher drive and energy than my girl, so if thats something you want then look at breeders who do that stuff, look at the parents and siblings to see what they're competing in.

BodyAcceptance,fmlpqww,t1_fml0s9y,1586190966.0,"Please don't take this the wrong way, but I think the reason why you don't see as much for men is because men don't push for these movements themselves. The whole reason why you see a lot of body positivity stuff is because women are constantlyyy pushing for it now. Years ago this didn't exist. There was no body positivity in the 90s or 80s.
That being said I have seen male body positivity artwork drawn by women on Tumblr. I know women on that website have that reputation of being ""tumblrinas"" or w/e but they push for body positivity for women and men. So feel free to check it out if you like! 

As for the ideal male figure vs female figure you mentioned. I respectfully disagree (in some aspects! ). I do agree that there is an ideal male figure nowadays, but I feel that it's something that hasn't been starting to be marketed strongly until recently. In most decades I can't throw a rock without seeing beautiful idealized (often sexualized) women thrown in my face, especially in really innocuous scenarios where I'm least expecting it. Sex sells and women are often used to promote and market All The Things. I feel as though women have had a much longer history of having beauty standards pushed on us than men (just look at all the things we've had to do to appear beautiful in various eras, corsets, lead based makeup, dyeing your teeth black, etc). 

I think what we're starting to see with men today is theyre being given their own beauty standards, thanks to the rise of media and the internet (I. E. social sites like IG, Tiktok and even dating apps.) Which is scary honestly... I wouldn't wish this on anyone. I sincerely hope it doesn't get to the point where men have to start wearing makeup, otherwise they won't look as ""put together"". Like I don't want to live in a world wear ones natural features are so unappealing that it has to be masked with make up . Or that there's an even bigger push for cosmetic surgery. If I'm not mistaken I believe women are the most common customers for plastic surgeries, but it's even beginning to increase for men, which tells me they're reacting to media that tells them they are less than or not worthy because they don't fit a beauty ideal. I believe S. Korea is one place where standards are insanely high for both men and women. I think it's because of male kpop groups. Now men feel like they have to look the same to be taken seriously. It's all really fucked up. I fear for the future a bit ngl.

If you check out the Normal Breast Gallery you'll probably see some breasts with ptosis.

The thing that I heard with IF is that it's best because  you're not grazing all day. It gives your body a chance to not have constant blood sugar spikes, which becomes a pattern and makes you predictably hungry too often. There was a video on this that explained it pretty well, I'll see if I can find it.

Chocolate isn't so bad, especially if you have dark chocolate. There are low calorie potato chips too.  If youre having issues with snack cravings perhaps look into 1200isplenty subreddit? They post low calorie snack ideas/recipes. So you can get your fix but not binge out of control either. Other option is to straight up power through it. For me the first 2-3 weeks were the hardest. I had horrible insomnia at night (I was a night snacker) because usually I would eat something and then it would help me fall asleep, but now I couldn't rely on that anymore. It's a lot of willpower and telling yourself ""no, you really don't need to eat right now, you're just bored"" . I suggest drinking water or tea every time you feel the urge to binge on snacks. Like just gulp it down and walk away from the cupboard/fridge lmao. It takes some time but you can retrain yourself."
intermittentfasting,fkom1fm,t1_fkolllx,1584389899.0,"I eat whatever I want, just less haha. Typically I don't  eat until 12 or 1 pm. Usually just a cup of skyr/yogurt, granola and thawed blueberries. Then if I'm still hungry I'll snack a bit, I'm not really too selective about what I eat. At that point I usually eat supper sometime before 8pm (my cut off time). I attribute my success mostly to sticking to my eating windows and just eating less honestly. Now that I've been fastng for a while I find myself not feeling hungry as often or at least being able to resist the urges more? Sorry if that wasn't very helpful! I don't calorie count or anything like that."
drugstoreMUA,fkolleo,t3_fjlkdb,1584389648.0,Lovely aesthetic!
intermittentfasting,fkolbpp,t3_fjbhfg,1584389493.0,"Little over 12 weeks of IF. I've been sticking to 16:8 religiously, no problems with that. So far I've lost 13lbs! I'm very pleased, and I'm glad I stuck with it. I still have about 20lbs more until I reach my GW."
harvestmoon,fkojunh,t3_fh581i,1584388657.0,Back to Nature will always be my favorite. It was the first one I ever played and will always hold a special place in my heart. It's basically shaped how I view all other HM/SOS games. I'd say my favorite after that would be A Wonderful Life. That game has such chill vibes. I love it.
goats,fkmb0r2,t1_fkma7ac,1584324764.0,"Yeah I'm looking to focus purely on raising goats for meat. So sticking with a meaty breed seems like my best bet! The only downsides I've heard about boers is they're a bit less thrifty compared to Kikos or Spanish (esp when it comes to parasites), and that they can sometimes have difficultly kidding."
PlasticSurgery,fkm9vyc,t3_fjcux7,1584324058.0,You have an ideal nose.  Plenty of girls would pay a surgeon to give them your nose lol. You look fine in your photos. Sounds like BDD to me.
loveafterporn,fklv63s,t1_fklv3yg,1584315297.0,Thank you!
Trufemcels,fklty2h,t3_fjafp5,1584314528.0,I don't find any of those guys ugly. But if they're considered 6/8s then those girls should definitely be ranked the same as them or higher.
ForeverAlone,fkk0m4n,t3_fiwl1p,1584268400.0,Yeah depression will do that to you. You get to the point where you truly feel as though you're not meant to enjoy anything in life or ever be happy. Moments of happiness are incredibly fleeting and I don't find any of my favorite hobbies enjoyable anymore (art in particular) which is fucking sad. I can't bring myself to start new ones or do anything productive. It's like my body and mind reject happiness. I think some people are just put on earth to suffer until we die tbh.
Vindicta,fkj7gr4,t3_firkbc,1584238190.0,"Aren't ppl from Scandinavian countries notorious for [avoiding social interaction](https://d1vlhxry9oul9s.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sufghcz.jpg)? lol So I wouldn't take it personally if you're not approached. There are certain countries like Spain, Italy and Latin America where men are more forward with their approaches. If you want a guy to approach you in your country then you'll probably have go to a bar or club, when inhibitions are lowered they're more likely to approach. Also being stared at with a smile is a good sign. I get looks and 99% of the time it's a blank expression, or a look of annoyance, people must find you non-threatening and pleasant to look at if they are smiling."
smallboobproblems,fkif3sf,t1_fkhx6qm,1584218520.0,"Thank you very much for the comment, it's really nice to know I'm not alone feeling like this<3. I know many girls here are insecure over their chest size, and I'm grateful that such a group exists for us...but I sometimes still feel a bit like an outcast because most of the redditors here are petite and thin, and have those perky breasts that guys like. Whereas I don't have that. It's bad feeling like an outcast among ""outcasts"". 

I really hope that we'll all be able to overcome these feelings of inadequacy someday<3"
smallboobproblems,fkied20,t1_fkhzo5g,1584218026.0,Yes I'm hoping to start working out when I can afford a gym membership :-). I actually don't hate my wide shoulders from the front. I like the aesthetic of a  strappy dress with a square neckline (really accentuates the shoulders). For some reason I just don't like how they look from behind... I feel like with the broad shoulders it kinda of cancels out any chance I have at being considered petite. I guess I should just learn to embrace it though. Thanks for the commment <3
smallboobproblems,fkie1ng,t1_fki53ek,1584217813.0,"Yeah I feel that way too, like my belly wouldn't look so big in comparison."
PlasticSurgery,fjzqug6,t3_ffkjda,1583726624.0,Are you sure you don't have mild lipedema/lymphoedema? It may affect the method of liposuction for you.
depression,fjwxnam,t3_ff5ykt,1583648728.0,"God this is so terrifying and upsetting . I know this doesn't mean much considering the gravity of what you're going through right now, but I am truly, truly sorry. I've lost a parent in a car accident, though it was many years ago that shit will always haunt me for the rest of my life. 

Reading your post reminded me how much I dread this life... having relationships and forming close connections with people. Knowing that someone I love dearly can be taken away from me without a moments notice. I literally cannot bare the thought of it, and have contemplated living alone for the rest of my life. I'm so sickened that you're going through this. I wish this world wasn't so fucking cruel and unfair."
dyscalculia,fjj0aql,t3_fdmnvp,1583379990.0,I feel u buddy. :'-(
analog,fj8rprh,t1_fj8c4m8,1583120495.0,"Looks like a gibson girl (more of a aesthetic/beauty ideal at the time, rather than an actual person). Sorry if that's not very helpful haha."
HumansBeingBros,fj64l73,t3_f9tts2,1583056414.0,Poor sweetheart. He's lucky to have such a nice human taking care of him. I hope he continues to make progress.
Trufemcels,fj5rkc8,t3_fbn4t7,1583040752.0,Having an enormous game collection is one of my life goals lol.
SuicideWatch,fj34iwi,t3_fb7vcy,1582966865.0,"Not to be crude but your corpse will float. Someone will find it, so it's not really disposed of like you would imagine. As for your main question, yes you definitely have a chance of surviving a gunshot. There have been people who have survived and rendered disfigured from a shotgun blast to the face.  I can relate to the suicidal urges, and I'm really sorry you're going through that. Please do not consider shooting yourself."
