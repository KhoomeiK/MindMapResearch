Pixel4XL,fprjmki,t1_fpqowep,1588855773.0,I will say that so far the battery is pretty awful.
Pixel4XL,fpqivh4,t1_fpgzac2,1588823824.0,"I just sold my OP 7 Pro for the 4 XL. Good change of pace so far. The only downsides are screen brightness, battery, smaller storage and no screen recording. Stock Android is nice. Very iPhone- ish."
Flipping,fpmoupn,t1_fpmop19,1588737934.0,You guys are right. I shouldn't try this. I will give in to the doubt.
Flipping,fpltwy9,t1_fpltugz,1588719395.0,"Meet at Starbucks, etc."
Flipping,fplmi5k,t1_fplm4k9,1588715398.0,So you don't think it's possible to sell locally ?
Flipping,fpkjtt4,t1_fpkjn58,1588695966.0,How did they adjust them? All sellers? Even a power seller?
Flipping,fpivhwr,t1_fpity0i,1588649678.0,"iPhone, Samsung, Pixel probably."
PickAnAndroidForMe,fpdzskq,t3_gb2eky,1588537518.0,Pulled the trigger and picked up a Pixel 4XL from Craigslist for $450. So far absolutely loving the switch.
PickAnAndroidForMe,fpapj77,t1_fpapb34,1588453025.0,I haven't made the switch. Sort of talked myself out of it.
PickAnAndroidForMe,fp45a25,t1_fp3lmza,1588291964.0,Thank you. That's what I've been thinking. I'm low-key trying to get people to talk me out of this switch. I'm gonna stick with the 7 pro.
PickAnAndroidForMe,fp3l7rw,t1_fp3kq6i,1588281263.0,Let's trade!
Agoraphobia,ffb7q59,t1_ffb6rc2,1579754197.0,Thanks for your response. Yes I am in America and have heard basically what you're describing. That won't work for me -i will be homeless by then !
webdev,ff9wv7i,t1_ff9wozw,1579723255.0,Thanks for getting back to me. In what ways would WordPress be limiting? Bear in mind I do not have any experience in this field.
legaladvice,fdi13bc,t1_fdi0yxq,1578433862.0,"Well craigslist couldn’t ban me since it’s not an account driven thing from the prospective of those browsing, only posting. Would i face any legal repercussions?"
legaladvice,fdi0y9p,t1_fdi0roj,1578433786.0,"I was thinking that, but craigslist does that by default so I doubt I’d find anyone who went out of their way to uncheck the box."
oneplus,fc1z30a,t1_fc1yzwa,1577334272.0,Are you in the United States ? Did it just come in randomly?
Anxiety,fc16qle,t1_fc16o7c,1577309844.0,Just generalizing.

Agoraphobia,fby312a,t1_fby0m9m,1577206868.0,"Thank you so much for this. I know exactly what you're saying about the ""what kind of parent/ family member / friend/ etc. am I?"" I'm 30 years old now and have been dealing with this for so long and I'm starting to find my self talk and guilt about everything has held me back a lot. Maybe on some level I didn't want to get better because I felt so shitty about myself."
NeckbeardNests,f6qs68j,t1_f6qs3g3,1573084556.0,Currently doing this. I've been going telephone pole by telephone pole. Made it 20 miles from my home this week.

legaladvice,exl5tty,t1_exl5pco,1566406540.0,"I'm asking from a legal standpoint, not whether Facebook would ban me again. There is no way to figure out why you are banned. There's no human support for these type of matters."
legaladvice,exl5h3c,t1_exl5e5d,1566406337.0,"No, it takes months to get access to the marketplace."
Anxiety,evz1p27,t1_evz0uxe,1564946777.0,"Great. Go back to your shithole thought process if you must but don't go out of your way to bring others down. If you choose be self defeated- i get it. I do it all the time myself, but it don't let that impede on others and go around commenting that on positive reddit posts. Keep your defeatist attitude to yourself please. It's lame. Also don't try to marginalize my anxiety because you don't agree with what I said. Sound like you might just be a bad person."
Anxiety,evz0nc5,t1_evz0ic1,1564946038.0,Virtual housebound agoraphobic for 6 years. You can make the decision not to be negative about it.
Anxiety,evyzxdz,t1_evyzsyc,1564945530.0,Do you think there's a correlation between this thought process and what you're speaking of?
Anxiety,evy6t17,t1_evxxjd4,1564924406.0,What? Who said you had to sit around and wait ? I really don't mean this rudely but if you manage to be offended or see negative in this post you're right- it may never go away for you.
Showerthoughts,ev81h3u,t3_cio10n,1564267510.0,It's too hard to see what the sentiment is here. Come on people.

mobilerepair,etof95w,t1_etoe3m9,1563025891.0,It would work fine for like 30 minutes and then start doing it.
mobilerepair,erz9kjl,t1_erz8ci3,1561429336.0,"Yeah, I guess I just didn't take them out and then basically pryed the screen."
