I didn't calibrate the e steps and flow rate, that should be a next step, shouldn't it. 

My PTFE tube is very similar to the capricorn but is a different brand, which I assume is why things got worse when I installed it. However, the problem was happening with my stock PTFE tubing.

I am using the stock extruder. 

I just checked the arm and all looks good to me.

I'm about to switch to PLA from PETG, which I'm sure will work (well, fingers crossed.) But I definitely want to keep printing with this PETG.

Do you have any good recommendation videos for calibrating the e steps and flow rate?? Thank you!"

I tried it for a week or two then stopped sleeping with a pillow between my legs for a while and all my pain went away. Who's to say if they're related. I guess when I hurt my lower back, it could have hurt my mid back too. 

It could also be that both of us are sleeping in a non-neutral position, even with the pillow. Hope this helps."
