During my interview I said ""I'm not a code monkey, and I don't do well in boxes"" but a box is what I got. I had no influence over design, little say over frameworks, all because of what the client wanted. 

Then again, it was a consultancy, but even at my current company (where I'm a data scientist) I see this with the devs. They're using outdated libraries with very little documentation and community because management says so and won't budge on it. A couple of the devs just ask me for answers too, like they're used to not having to think.

Miway started making changes to its system with its  [MiWay5 Program](http://www.mississauga.ca/portal/miway/miwayfive). It used to be a radial system that came from city center, which led to a lot of unintuitive routes and long travel times to get down the road. They are making the changes to the grid system where possible by adding new buses, new routes, and getting rid of some old & redundant routes, thus increasing frequency.  

For example, according to [their first changes in April 2016](http://www7.mississauga.ca/documents/miway/servicechange/20160411/AccessibleDoc.pdf), the 26 Burnhamthorpe used to route into city center on weekdays but was changed to continue straight along Burnhamthorpe. With this they were able to add more stops that were usually skipped. Another example is them getting rid of the 35A and just having the 35 in October of 2020. The bus will go now end at the new community center at ninth line that will be finished then, and will have a much needed increase in frequency."
