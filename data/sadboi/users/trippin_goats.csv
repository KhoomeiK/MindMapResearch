If I had killed myself when my existential crisis was at its peak, I would've never seen myself achieve my goals. Hold on. Live by the day. If that's too much take life in by the hour or the minute. Whatever you can handle. Direct message me if you need to talk"

You around very judgmental. Last time I checked only Jesus is qualified for that. Maybe I should talk to your elders and tell them you were participating in hostile debate on a ""apostate"" discussion forum. 

Remember sir you're a Witness and you must keep composure or else your soiling gods name but if your just here to make JWs look bad.  You're doing a great job. I genuinely thank you for showing your true colors."

BPD,f1b2mm9,t3_d8jusi,1569320945.0,"I'm in this exact situation. I actually cried at work yesterday over exactly this. I noticed that the managers at my work didnt include me in their conversations like they used to. Used to share about our personal lives and make jokes. They only spoke to me if they absolutely needed to. I couldn't figure out why. During my shift I got really upset and I took out the trash just so I can go cry. I came back and didn't seem to care that im rubbing my eyes and that they were red and glossy. I didn't want her to know I was crying but I also knew you could see it in my face. Just made me feel even worse. 

I've always had issues with management.. I've always eventually have to explain my disorder and then not long after I look for another job. I can never tell if it's me feeling too much or if the intensity of my emotions are appropriate.. then I get into a loop of ""I can't trust my judgement so how can i even prove reality?"" Then I have a nervous breakdown and nothing is real to me. 

I thought I was the only one. You're not alone."
JehovahsWitnesses,f1agfc2,t1_f1abpig,1569293313.0,"And what about those with mental issues that cause instability and poor self control? There are plenty of things in the bible that were once okay but now isnt because times have changed. Incest for example. Why? Because its unhealthy, causes birth defects, lower IQ and you dont need to sleep with mommy Eve and daddy Adam. 
So why haven't the JWs discarded shunning. You tell your followers to only associate with other JWs to keep away from Satans temptations. They do. They make a mistake and they're shunned for it. Losing all your family and ""friends"" in the blink of an eye. It can definitely cause depression in those who are predisposed to it or worsen it. People attempt and have committed suicide over these things. Shunning is unhealthy, psychologically and physiologically damaging."
JehovahsWitnesses,f18j7du,t3_d7y7p3,1569258667.0,"Raised a JW. Never baptized. POMO  
The fear of being shunned was so great that I never got baptized. I watched the youth in my congregation get baptized because they wanted to please their parents and gain their approval (like most kids). I on the otherhand couldn't. I was so afraid of getting baptized and eventually make a mistake and get shunned by all my friends and family. Now as an adult I see how ignorant this form of punishment is. 
Why would God allow his ""witnesses"" to psychological and emotional abuse other witnesses as form of punishment. God is all knowing. Humans know very well what happens to the human psyche when they are isolated. I doubt God would want shunning to be a form of discipline to people who dedicate his life to him. Frankly a surprising amount of witnesses suffer from anxiety and depression. Probably because of how demanding this organization is. People who suffer from these disorders shouldn't isolate themselves. Shouldn't be shunned. It doesn't help, it makes the problem worse. The Jehovah Witnesses refuse to acknowledge very basic necessities of the human psyche. 

If anyone who reads this and is currently a baptized member of the organization please respond. I genuinely want to hear your thoughts"
BPD,ewctdcq,t3_cnj048,1565290051.0,Yeah if it's not the lifestyle I live that'll kill me early it will definitely be the stress. I'm sure that my stress alone steals at least 5 years from me.

exjw,euh3rtq,t1_eugtbl4,1563820280.0,I normally end up in heated debates with my mother about this. After I make the point that I have no issue with the bible teaches but the organization itself she starts saying I'm just like worldly people she preaches to. It's kinda funny actually
