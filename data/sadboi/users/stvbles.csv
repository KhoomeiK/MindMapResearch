* Fixed disabling Melee Target Compensation.
* Fixed Legend banners having a black box when having AA disabled.

ApexUncovered,fqefcix,t1_fqef0vz,1589306620.0," WEAPON AND LOOT UPDATES
Season 5 is the first season Apex doesn't get a new weapon. We stepped back and asked ourselves, does Apex need a new weapon every season? If we continue to add new weapons, the weapon pool will become saturated. We believe there is a ""right"" amount of weapons in the loot pool, and we think we are currently in that sweet spot. Vaulting weapons is not an option (because players have purchased skins), so we are forced to be more creative. We have some ideas on how to address it, but we need some time to test them and make sure they are healthy for Apex. We also want to make sure that weapons we add have real value to the gameplay. We have some fun stuff in the works. Our weapons team is hard at work. In the meantime, we hope the changes listed below can get you excited to learn and master the Season 5 weapon meta.

ApexUncovered,fqef0vz,t1_fqedg4u,1589306466.0,"Hey Legends,

We’re as excited as you are about the upcoming launch of Season 5 – Fortune’s Favor. From new Legend Loba, to the extensive updates to Kings Canyon, to the new Season Quests, we wanted to give you a high-level overview of all the changes we’re bringing to the game when Season 5 launches. We’re also making plenty of smaller buffs, tweaks, and fixes too.

Be sure to check those out and give yourself an edge before you drop in to pursue your fortune on May 12!

NEW LEGEND: LOBA

Stylish, sophisticated, and resourceful, Loba uses her Jump Drive bracelet to teleport where she pleases and takes what she wants.

Tactical - Burglar’s Best Friend

Teleport to hard-to-reach places or escape trouble quickly by throwing your Jump Drive bracelet. Ultimate - Black Market Boutique

Place a portable device that allows you to teleport nearby loot to your inventory. Each friendly or enemy Legend can take up to two items. Passive - Eye for Quality

Nearby epic and Legendary loot can be seen through walls. The range is the same as Black Market Boutique. Learn more about Loba on her Lore page here. MAP UPDATE: KINGS CANYON

Skulltown and Thunderdome have fallen. A new POI, Salvage, has been added to the Broken Coast. Across the map, the Offshore Rig connects to the former Relay and Wetlands. Wetlands has been replaced by the excavation of the Capacitor, which has a new underground pathway to Singh Labs. Nesting Grounds has continued to regrow into the Reclaimed Forest, which features an expanded Singh Labs exterior and a small camp outside of The Cage. Check out our blog post here for more information on these changes!

Kings Canyon will be the only map available for two weeks after the season launch, so players can have time to fully explore the changes and meta shift. After the two week honeymoon period, Map Rotation will start rotating World’s Edge Season 4 into the mix.

CHARGE TOWERS

Charge Towers are new devices unearthed in the excavation of Kings Canyon. Activate them to grant a full Ultimate charge to any Legends standing on the platform when the charge blast goes out.

SEASON QUEST: “THE BROKEN GHOST” Introduces Apex’s first Quest - a season-long search for 9 pieces of a mysterious relic. Find your first daily Treasure Pack in any competitive match to get started on your hunt, and enjoy free weekly drops of new Story, Gameplay, and Rewards along the way. Learn more about Quests in our blog post here.

SEASON TAB All seasonal content has been moved into its own tab in the lobby. Here, you can find the Battle Pass, Quest, and Challenges tabs. Future events in this season will show up here as well.

BATTLE PASS S5

Fight your way to glory with the Season 5 Battle Pass. Complete Daily and Weekly challenges to unlock over 100 exclusive items including exclusive Legendary skins, gun charms, skydive emotes, Apex Packs, XP Boosts, load screens, and more.

RANKED SERIES 4 This new season starts a new Ranked Series! This season we are sticking to mostly the same format but have also introduced a key feature, Reconnect. RECONNECT Players that leave a match unexpectedly can now rejoin their match in progress. ""Unexpected"" means exiting the match through any means other than the system menu, including crashing, using alt+f4 on PC, or ""dashboarding"" to close the game on console. To reconnect, simply restart the game and enter the lobby. The game will automatically attempt to reconnect you if the match is still valid, your squad is still alive, and your chance to reconnect hasn't timed out. Reconnect will be available for all competitive modes.

Disconnected players' characters remain in the state they were in while the player was connected. To their teammates, it will look a bit like the disconnected player has gone afk (with an icon next to their name to indicate disconnection). This means when the player reconnects, they can immediately continue where they left off. Unless, that is, they were killed beforehand. Player characters can be knocked out and eliminated while the player is disconnected. Disconnected players whose characters have died can be respawned normally, by taking their banner to a respawn beacon, before or after the player has reconnected. If a player doesn't reconnect in time,  the disconnected player's character is removed as normal, and the game will treat their disconnect as an abandonment. There is a limited time window in which a player can reconnect and failing to do so in Ranked will result in a loss penalty. Loss forgiveness does not activate until a player is fully removed from the game, so don't drop from a ranked match when your squadmates have a chance to reconnect!

To read more on Series 4 Ranked, Read the blog here.

CONDITIONAL LEGEND CHATTER Under certain pairings, Legends will speak to each other differently when prompted with normal dialogue cues. How does Loba thank Revenant for a revive? She sure doesn’t say “Thank you.”

There are many pairings if you are interested in hearing what everyone has to say. Experiment!

Mirage

Now it’s a party! Your favorite trickster has learned a few new tricks to bamboozle his enemies in this new rework for Season 5.

Designer Note: The hope for this rework is that it gives more depth to Mirage gameplay by giving Mirage players avenues to get better at Bamboozling people.

Tactical: Psyche Out Pressing the character utility action button allows Mirage to gain control of his decoy. When controlling the decoy, it will mimic Mirage’s every move. Decoys now last for 60 seconds. Releasing another decoy will remove the previous decoy. Ultimate: Life of the Party Mirage deploys a team of decoys that mimic his every move (think “Emergency Dance Party"" from DUMMIEs Big Day). Cooldown 60 seconds. Passive: Now You See Me… In addition to cloaking when downed, Mirage also cloaks while using a respawn beacon and reviving a teammate (the teammate is also cloaked). Mirage’s “You got Bamboozled” line will now trigger when you bamboozle an enemy, instead of when you release a decoy. Bloodhound

Tactical: Eye of the Allfather Increased Sonar Detection from 3 seconds to 4 seconds. Decreased Cooldown from 35 seconds to 25 seconds. Crypto

Tactical: Drone Crypto can now ping banners, while in drone, to warn teammates of nearby squads. Lifeline

Increased Lifeline bin ratio to 20% Removed Knockdown Shields from Secret Compartment loot pool Caustic

Designer note: this is something that is a bit of an experiment.  We will be keeping an eye out to make sure this change doesn’t cause any degenerate player behavior.

Friendly gas no longer slows teammates. Caustic traps are no longer triggered from the other side of a door. Octane

Designer note: This is a first step in pushing more team utility for Octane. We have more updates planned but they didn’t make the cutoff for this patch.

Launch Pad cooldown is reduced from 90 seconds to now 60 seconds. Gibraltar

Designer note: Internal data shows that Gibraltar’s performance in individual fights is in a good place, but we want to bring down his power a bit in team fights.

Reduced Dome Shield duration from 18s to 12s. Pathfinder

Designer note: Given the power of quick repositioning in Apex, being able to use Pathfinder’s Grappling Hook multiple times in a fight is both too powerful and muddies combat legibility.

The cooldown for Grappling Hook has been increased from 15 seconds to 35 seconds."
