Antipsychiatry,fr6194q,t3_gmqun5,1589918141.0,"Yeah, it doesn't make very much sense. You go to school from roughly age 5 to 18 and you learn a lot of the essentials of life. How to count, how to read, how to form proper sentences, etc. But if you happen to end up in a mental hospital, you might have to re-learn a lot of those things."

antidepressants,fqs9lw8,t1_fqs9h89,1589601643.0,If you've taken antipsychotics before maybe that's why they think it will help. I'm not a doctor but I've heard the long term effects of the drugs are really bad. If you've never taken them before though I probably wouldn't take it.
antidepressants,fqs9h89,t3_gkml2h,1589601555.0,I have. If they didn't warn you about the side effects I would do a simple search on Wikipedia. For me it didn't really do anything for depression and I wish I wouldn't have taken it.
anhedonia,fqp94a1,t3_gk5zvy,1589539413.0,I use Zyn peppermint pouches even though I know I shouldn't. I feel like it calms me down and let's me think straight. Both before and after.
antidepressants,fqoqypb,t3_gjzcuh,1589522292.0,I wouldn't do it... from the people I've talked to and the things I've seen.
antidepressants,fqn2o9z,t3_gjtncg,1589487652.0,Like tremors?
antidepressants,fqlc0p5,t1_fql2ihf,1589453470.0,Sometimes melatonin works for sleep for me. I've had chronic sleep problems for a long time.
antidepressants,fql2ihf,t3_gjhxrd,1589443992.0,"It is absolutely the cause.  I would highly recommend you get off of it as fast as possible. Doesn't matter what the dose is, those meds are bad news."
antidepressants,fqkwzye,t3_gje142,1589438807.0,You don't want to take either one of them.
trees,fqjcnrv,t3_gj7zkn,1589408072.0,Lol I cant tell if kids just get better weed or if something actually changes physiologically and you respond differently to it as you get older.
antidepressants,fqjal2h,t3_gizreh,1589407284.0,I had something very similar happen while I was on antidepressants. What pills are you talking about? Some medical literature talks about dopamine supersensitivity psychosis but that is usually an effect of long-term use of antipsychotics.
antidepressants,fqj9vp4,t3_gix2f0,1589407018.0,Effexor takes time but the changes will happen. I took it for probably 4 years total and now I don't respond well to any of them.
antidepressants,fqj9bv3,t3_giyalr,1589406802.0,"There must be improvements eventually. I took almost every antidepressant there is and I was able to recover from each one. It took time but eventually things would come back to normal, or at least to a place where I could function normally with other people. It may also have to do with things you are consuming now, because pills can affect your metabolism. Are you still sweating? How is your vision? How do your muscles and joints feel?"
CHSinfo,fqj89av,t3_gj7qa3,1589406393.0,Very bizarre you mentioned this. Years ago I used to have something where I smelled a bag of pretty pungent weed and my stomach would gargle right after. Maybe it has something to do with the way terpenes affect the stomach but I really have no idea. I certainly never got sick from smelling weed though.
antidepressants,fqj7uhx,t3_gj1kag,1589406231.0,What pills?
Antipsychiatry,fqiwuan,t3_gid7ut,1589401968.0,"If you had super chronic sleep problems like I had, you might be able to switch the seroquel out for melatonin. Ever since I made the switch I'm sleeping plenty. 10mg at night usually has me out within an hour or 2. With seroquel for sleep I would get this daunting feeling in my leg and it was not a good time."
Antipsychiatry,fqiv3ee,t1_fqf5umt,1589401289.0,"Nope, I quit everything 6 months ago. Still some PRN prescriptions laying around but the only one I take consistently is melatonin because I can't sleep."
Antipsychiatry,fqiusss,t1_fqga2ni,1589401175.0,"Means it takes a long time for the drug to leave your body. Prozac is supposed to stay in your system for close to a week after taking one dose. It's the longest acting antidepressant, but it's also one with some of the most severe side effects."
PSSD,fqgjwa4,t1_fqgjsxl,1589348241.0,Also curious which drug(s) caused it.
PSSD,fqgjsxl,t3_ggzcbc,1589348168.0,The staff used to ask if I had these same symptoms when I used to go to the ER for health phobias. Now I know what they were actually talking about.
Antipsychiatry,fqg7ebc,t3_gi9k0q,1589339570.0,It's generally one of the easier meds to stop because it has a long half life.
Antipsychiatry,fqc6kr1,t3_ghvn9r,1589251182.0,"I'm trying my hardest not to call it anhedonia. I know that's what it really is, the medical definition of this, but I have also experienced dysphoria periodically in my past and it is a thousand times worse than anhedonia. If you've had it you know what I'm talking about. Not eating gluten, for me, keeps the dysphoria away, for now. 

People say exposure therapy works, but for me, it's avoiding those triggers that keeps me from spiraling. Or trying my best to alter those triggers. There are people you need to avoid and there are people you need to find comfort in. 

And if it builds your confidence in any way, I believe anyone that has suffered the damage of phenothiazines and their derivatives are the most powerful people in the world. This was something you didn't know was going to happen so you can't beat yourself up over it.

There's a part of me that says I have to throw away my old life entirely but to be honest, I'm mostly in the same boat as you."
Antipsychiatry,fqbrw6b,t1_fq9s8ut,1589242720.0,I really wish I could go back too. Trying to find the positives in life right now.
antidepressants,fqb8t5m,t3_ghterh,1589232588.0,We dont really know the mechanism of action. A lot of people don't respond well to the antipsychotics. Everyone I talk to tells me to stay away from them.
schizophrenia,fq8e7cs,t1_fq8cuyn,1589164196.0,Damn did yours happen out of nowhere or did something trigger it?
Akathisia,fq8dw3f,t3_ghenoo,1589163989.0,Its definitely possible but it's considered one of the more weaker meds that don't really tend to do anything.
Antipsychiatry,fq7ykv4,t3_gdv86f,1589154860.0,Nice video and way to keep the positivity.
Antipsychiatry,fq7m73h,t3_gal48q,1589148256.0,Brand-name brain damage
Antipsychiatry,fq7k5p5,t3_ggys2n,1589147462.0,"I'm pretty sure the atypicals cause the symptoms of autism in children. I guarantee if you don't seek meds for your child they will develop a lot more normal. It's not only mental harm like difficulty speaking, they can also affect your physical health and the way you look. Your nerves, senses, all of that is put in jeopardy. It really does make you retarded and the prescribers just say ""nope, can't happen."""
Antipsychiatry,fq7hzo0,t3_gh70vl,1589146635.0,And the Ritalin and clonidine doesn't come close to the harm that the atypicals like risperidone can do. But 90 milligrams is still an absurd amount of speed to give to a 9 year old.
Antipsychiatry,fq7hdd3,t3_gh70vl,1589146410.0,"I've never had a serious problem with any therapist. It's the psychiatrists I have a problem with, not telling you the actual risks of what the drugs can do. Even after I am told I have to do my own research for hours to make sure I'm going to be okay. The physical and mental harm of these drugs bother me more than any past experience of trauma."
Antipsychiatry,fq7ev79,t1_fq7e9ai,1589145478.0,"And on another note, does anything really bad happen after drinking or has it only been the ability to feel the euphoria from it? In higher doses I get pacing, shaking, muscle spasms and uncontrollable movements. It's really a sick joke and I'm really bummed out about it because that was how I used to feel okay or have something to look forward to."
Antipsychiatry,fq7e9ai,t3_gh3uxt,1589145253.0,"I've seen these posts before and I've seen how different people respond to alcohol. The neuroleptics definitely do something, even after you get off of them where you aren't able to feel drugs or alcohol, or they affect you very negatively. Same thing with laughter and crying, or the feeling of connection. I think the doctors know exactly what they do and they don't inform the patient that it's a possibility because they think their lives will benefit from not being on street drugs or alcohol. I'm not sure if it's brain damage or an autoimmune reaction that occurs from the drugs but something gets changed after neuroleptics. For me it didn't start happening until I quit the drugs--up until then I was feeling mostly normal."
anhedonia,fq72xia,t3_gass4f,1589141100.0,Yeah they don't get it.
anhedonia,fq3k7p6,t1_fq3jrof,1589067311.0,Huh. I also took Zoloft in the 9th grade. But yeah I would recommend trying to stop and maybe try eating a different diet. For me it was a gluten free diet but I guess it can be different for everyone.
anhedonia,fq3ihas,t3_ggq1zt,1589066806.0,Have you taken medications in the past? To me it sounds like pretty extreme depression but not anhedonia.
Antipsychiatry,fq374d2,t3_gglof1,1589063629.0,Interesting. I took it for 14 years and stopped about 5 months ago. I'm pretty sure the pharmaceutical companies have already been sued to their britches and we have to learn to live with it.
antidepressants,fq369kx,t3_ggmlhp,1589063400.0,"Over time you will find yourself on 2 or 3 antidepressants and they won't be doing anything. At least that was my case. With those, time usually resolves it to a degree.  Can't say the same for other meds. If I could rewind I would've stopped before it was too late. Eventually you get more impulsive and agitated and you realize it's doing way more harm than good."
anhedonia,fpzgwxa,t3_gd1o22,1589018099.0,Yeah I second the feeling of your head being filled with glue. I always relate it to having cement in my brain that won't come out. I definitely have the same thing.

Antipsychiatry,fpx2u5p,t3_gfm08e,1588974612.0,The antipsychotic drugs can cause schizophrenia symptoms even in healthy people. I would just recommend getting off of it as fast as possible but some people aren't that lucky.
Antipsychiatry,fpul3m1,t1_fpu48fs,1588915788.0,Yes why
schizophrenia,fpu3xzx,t1_fpjo95n,1588904141.0,Yeah the doctors probably don't tell the parents about how bad the side effects really are. To be honest by the OPs description of him it sounds like he's taken the drugs before. They completely change the way you look even when you're off of them.

I honestly think antipsychotics in general fuel schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Been on meds since I was 12 but everything started popping off when the doctors started prescribing atypicals. I no longer see much of a life left, but that's just me. As long as I'm not spending time in the hospital getting injections, I can deal with the depression. I am lucky enough to have people that love me and care for me... But obviously others aren't as lucky.
