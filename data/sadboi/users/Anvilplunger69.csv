On another note, if you don‚Äôt want to take medication like me I would refrain from telling your therapist that you‚Äôre taking psychedelics. They use that to tell you your brain chemistry is fucked up and you need the meds now. Which tbf, your brain chemistry is fucked up, but it will return to normal after a few months.

My therapist told me she won‚Äôt see me anymore unless Ik taking meds because ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting too deep and personal to not have you established on a strong baseline. Especially since you‚Äôve been taking mushrooms and your brain chemistry is even farther off from baseline than just being bipolar.‚Äù

Just my two cents"
LSD,f0v12ie,t1_f0v06fs,1568958462.0,"Yep. That‚Äôs called addiction. As someone who‚Äôs dealt with it for practically forever, don‚Äôt believe that you can‚Äôt get addicted to psychs. Sure you can‚Äôt get a physical dependency, but you definitely can get addicted. You need to recognize that and make steps toward overcoming it. 

You‚Äôre gonna be bored not taking psychs, I know, I‚Äôve been there, with more than psychs. They‚Äôre fucking awesome, until they‚Äôre not. And then you take more So you can get a new, more intense, powerful experience. And then more. And then more; and you can really fuck yourself up. You need to make a decision to stop, or at least do less. Then less, then less, then none. And ffs man you can come back to it at some point, I have. I can hold myself accountable now when it comes to taking psychs. Find someone to hold you accountable, someone you can be completely honest with, who doesn‚Äôt judge you for it. Until you can hold yourself accountable.

There are several reasons people get addicted to drugs, but the most prevalent is that they have issues they‚Äôre escaping from, mainly family issues in their childhood. Shit man read my post history: I‚Äôm bipolar, I‚Äôm fucking depressed, and you won‚Äôt see it in my history but I can tell you I can‚Äôt function in a relationship. My whole family has issues relating, I have to watch YouTube videos and read articles to figure out what the best way to respond to anger, or empathy, or someone else achieving something is. You know what never cured it? Taking 8 grams of shrooms my third week in an row. Getting fucking loaded and bawling my eyes out making a suicide note recording on my phone to leave with my therapist. 

You have to remember that while acid is not really a ‚Äúhard drug‚Äù, people literally do permanent damage to their psyche with it, and IT IS STILL A DRUG. My dad did himself permanent damage taking 2500ug as a teenager.

If you don‚Äôt have anyone in your life to help you, hold you accountable, remind you why you‚Äôve been taking them and why it‚Äôs bad, I‚Äôd be happy to give you my phone number, my Facebook, Instagram, whatever. I‚Äôve been through what you‚Äôre going through multiple times myself, and I‚Äôm sure I will again. 

You need help, or at the very least someone supporting you getting better, and you may not believe it right now, but I am in total support of you getting better. And if you‚Äôre skeptical, I‚Äôd love a chance to prove it to you. And btw, no matter what you think, you do deserve to be healthy, happy and functional. At the very least functional üòÇ. This is a big one for me, one I‚Äôm still struggling with myself, one that I imagine I will continue to struggle with a long time. I know it‚Äôs true, and I know I have to accept it, I just can‚Äôt seem to yet. But if I can finally accept that, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll have issues anymore. I‚Äôm hoping the same for you man. Whatever issues you‚Äôve been through, even if you think they‚Äôre minor (guarantee they‚Äôre taking more of a toll on you than you think), you can come to terms with them, and make a better life. Some of us get dealt a shitty hand, and you know what, I just like to give a middle finger to whoever put that shit on me, and remind them that I will fight with my teeth and fingernails to get what I want. And what I want is to be better. Better than yesterday, better than last week. Better than a year ago. 

I hope you want to get better too. I want you to get better"

Damnthatsinteresting,ez1njet,t1_ez1l8th,1567649205.0,"So if it‚Äôs sagging you have to identify why. Either the screws in the jamb or the door have come somewhat loose over time, you can tell if the hinge isn‚Äôt tight up against the door or the jamb. To fix that you can plug the holes and put longer screws in. Standard on most homes are 5/8‚Äù screws which honestly suck total ass. Use 1‚Äù. For a plug, cut a piece of pine or other wood into a wedge, and split it longways. Use a piece that‚Äôs slightly bigger than the hole and hammer it in until it‚Äôs tight, but not demolishing your jamb or door. Snap it off and put the hinge back, and screw the hinge back on with the 1‚Äù screws. If you only have two hinges on the door I recommend placing something under the door when you remove the top hinge to keep the door from falling into the floor. Allowing that will cause your bottom hinge to bend and cause more problems. 

The other thing you can do if the hinge itself is tight is remove the hinge and use a 2-1/2‚Äù or longer screw and run it through the jamb and into the framing behind, behind the hinge. This will suck the jamb over and alleviate the sag."
