We dont have a stable doctor as of yet, I'm very wary of a lot of gynos here when it comes to PCOS they dont care enough and just prescribe meds and are done with it. So I'm still searching. But i think she'll be comfortable with me speaking to her doctor whenever we find a good one. 

Yes i agree. I do try to be as approachable and sensitive to her as possible but our family dynamic makes it difficult to find a comfortable way to be chill with each other. But i think she does share a lot with me and has shared her concerns often.
