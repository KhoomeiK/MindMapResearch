GayChristians,fg25d2j,t3_ewdty0,1580438610.0,"So damn hard to hear this. But it was the slightest thing I’ve heard. My father is a pastor and he would always say that I was destined to hell, that God hated me and my promiscuity, that I was an embarrassment to the family, that I should move out asap. 

I’ve been attending to an inclusive church and It’s been amazing to find out that God loves me, he cares for me and he doesn’t reject me. I have to confess that It’s freaking hard to get over and forget years of brainwashing, but I believe the truth shall set me free as Jesus said.

This thread has been helping me a lot heart♥️"
