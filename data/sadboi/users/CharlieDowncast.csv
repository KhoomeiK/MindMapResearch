We actually live together. When I moved out of the shelter we were in, I insisted she would stay with me to be safe. I learned a great deal from her. From gaining confidence to realizing how much sex and closeness means to me. She has her demons too, which makes sex awkward at times. I hear other couples on their sex lives and it gets to me to the point that I hate myself for having these needs. For her intimacy = sex. And me the other way around. Its so.....frustrating.

Now I feel things are forced and I feel being friends or giving eachother space would help. We've talked about it a few times and she would at least want to see therapy to work things out. Yet I've already retreated to my daydreaming. Staying in my hopeless romantic world that makes sense. Holding myself tight with all the chaos and confusion. I have been talking to a penpal who seems perfect to me. Someone who craves love and attention since all her life she was the giver. Another hopeless romantic. But she has a man shes trying to get with. I currently help her because I care but what used to be fleeting feelings of connection are now close to numbness....
