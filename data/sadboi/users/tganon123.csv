SeattleWA,foi9i0t,t3_g788tk,1587781553.0,"The solutions being proposed here attempt to address symptoms instead of root causes. It's one thing to blame individuals since we all individually have at least some degree of agency, but if a person is going to make policy suggestions, it's important to have those recommendations address the macro conditions that make crime more likely, and to also be backed up by empirical research. When we look at surface level symptoms, we need to keep asking ""why?"" and ""how?"" until we get to the source.

I'm not going to pretend that I know all of the solutions. With any social issue, there are always a wide variety of factors that synergize together. Based on what I've read, I think that at least one factor could be the phenomenon of secondary deviance presented by the labeling school of sociology. If children are labeled as being ""bad kids"" when they're young for relatively trivial things, that label can shape the way both peers and school staff interact with them making it really hard to shake. Over time, the label becomes a part of their identity, and with the societally acceptable role closed off to them, they're more likely to align with others who've had similar experiences. 

I know it's going to be unpopular for me to say this, but race is a factor in the labeling process that results in secondary deviance. There is research that shows that black students are punished more harshly than white students for the same infractions. Once a student has a suspension on the record, the labeling process can snowball, and continue promote additional secondary deviance.

If they do fall into crime and start selling drugs, there has also been research done here in Seattle published by the University of Washington showing both that police disproportionately arrest black dealers, and also tend to target drugs that black people are more likely to sell, rather than the ones that white people tend to sell. Once a person has been has been arrested, it continues the spiral of secondary deviance. God forbid if they actually get sent to prison. How are you supposed to reintegrate if the label of ex-convict prevents you from getting a job? 

Regardless of what you feel about moral responsibility, if the way systems operate promote this chain, I think it's likely that you're going to continue to have more offenders. Every step along this process, it becomes harder and harder for people to change their behavior and reintegrate. And again, you can argue that's their problem, but if you want people to change their behavior, or prevent that behavior from escalating, then why try to make it more difficult for that to happen?"
CriticalTheory,fnla3ky,t1_fnl5tj1,1587049859.0,"I only have this account. I'm not sure why you're accusing me of using two accounts. Is it to try to discredit me?

First, when I brought up logic, I wasn't saying that we shouldn't use logic to understand the situation. However, the logic I'm using accounts for the fact that there are a wide variety of responses to trauma, and as a result, to act like every survivor would both respond in the same way and then make the decisions that we feel would be the most tactical would be short-sighted. That's just not reality. 

Second, as far as the current election goes, people can do whatever they want, but if someone decides to vote for Biden as a way to get rid of Trump, I want them to acknowledge what both men have done and how those actions factored into their decision. I think that while Trump is a lot worse, both of them are monsters. 

Overall, I'm actually way more concerned with what it says about how victims are seen and treated in our society. We're used as pawns by the powerful to attack their enemies and then tossed aside when we're not useful. The arguments that Democrats are using right now are the same ones that Republicans used against Ford, but since they want to gain power they've conveniently forgotten this. We're being objectified all over again. 

The idea of being falsely accused is horrifying. I get this especially because I'm part of a community that is vulnerable due to stereotypes of us being predatory. However, to say that an accuser is guilty until proven innocent means that almost all victims can't be trusted since there are rarely witnesses. That's why I lean so hard into believing victims. In Biden's case though, the fact that he has a long history of exerting power over women by touching them inappropriately should be factored in as evidence against him."
CriticalTheory,fnk8hdm,t1_fnhaepq,1587018212.0,"First, I'm so sorry that happened. It sounds terrifying.

I don't think your argument makes sense. First of all, I think that trying to analyze why a survivor didn't come forward using strict logic doesn't work because trauma can dramatically alter how you think. What made sense to her at the time could seem irrational to other people. If we did try to logic out out though based on your argument that if she was concerned about him being powerful before, she would have come forward before, I think there are several holes. Biden first became VP 12 years ago. We have no idea whether or not she was psychologically in a place to come forward in 2008. She also could have thought back then that no one would have believed her. Keep in mind, this was almost 10 years before the Me Too era, and by the time that movement started he was already out of office. 

Yes she had the attention of the Me Too movement last year, but she said that she still didn't feel safe since she was receiving threats. She tried to reach out to Times Up back in January, but they abandoned her. When she came forward, it was clear that Biden was getting close to clinching the nomination. However, an opponent was still in the race, and even though he was extremely behind, she probably thought that if the media picked up her story, maybe that might be enough for people to rethink electing the man who raped her. 

Ultimately, neither of us actually know how her trauma and material conditions have affected her ability to come forward. We can go back and forth and try to guess using the lenses of our own experiences, but ultimately the factors that allow a person to be able to come forward are complex. A lot of the time the person who's experiencing won't even fully understand. 

For me, people asked ""if it happened over and over again for over four years, why did she keep going back to his house?,"" ""why was she so warm with him all these years"","" ""why did she decide to work with him for another four years at his school after she graduated?"" If someone wanted to, they could craft a narrative that allows them to argue that I'm lying. The story my abuser told people was that he ""had no idea why I would say such awful things about him, especially when he had done so much to help me over the years; it must be because she's mentally ill"" (which no shit, being raped two hundred times causes some problems). 

The problem is that the people who don't believe me don't know the context. He started grooming me when I was twelve years old, he positioned himself to replace my father after he started drinking and actively endangering my life. After my father died, I was completely emotionally dependent on him. When he decided to start molesting me he used that dependency as leverage, and used Foucault's arguments for removing age of consent laws to convince me that what he wasn't messed up, I had consented, and actually that it was my fault that it happened. Even after my PTSD symptoms got worse and worse when I was around 17, and as a result realized Foucault was full of shit, I was still so dependent on him that I believed that he him when he said that his intentions were pure. He also promised to never do it to anyone else, and I believed him So I stayed for another four years. 

I'm not sure what was the catalyst that allowed me to wake up and come forward. I had read about grooming several years before I came forward, and even though what he did was text book, he was adamant that he never intentionally groomed me. One day I was watching a youtube video where a person was describing their experiences, and something started to click. Shortly after, I heard that a kid was going to be hanging around their after hours again, and when I realized how uncomfortable that made me, that's when I decided I had to speak out. People will ask me why at that moment, and I don't know what to tell them. I had access to information I needed way before that, but it took a long time for me to be able to internalize it. 

We don't know the larger context. I'm choosing to believe her because I know what it's like to have people cherry pick specific details to discredit you when it's convenient for them"

When people have a vested interest in supporting the accused, survivors are dissected, our lives are torn apart while they look for any small bit of evidence to claim that we're liars or that we're crazy.

Your outfit's not ""pornified"" or ""a fetishized male idea."" Aside from the shirt which would look better if it was more form fitting, I have seen cis girls wear thigh highs and a-line skirts. Ultimately there's not one universal way the cis women dress. They vary just like we do, however when they decide to dress in ways that are somewhat unconventional, their gender isn't brought into question. 

As trans people one of the things we unfortunately have to navigate is the balance between presenting how we're comfortable, and how much we'll be punished by cis people for our presentation. This is a messed up situation. Obviously make whatever decisions you need to along that continuum, but please don't internalize cis people's toxic rhetoric like dec has. 

&#x200B;

As far as passing goes, what I've learn as a trans woman who presents pretty androgynously is that ultimately voice matters more than anything else. If I'm able to maintain a cis passing voice, people will correct themselves and apologize to me when I open my mouth. The reverse is also true. If I dress femme and automatically get gendered correctly on sight, but my voice isn't cis passing, the way people perceive me changes instantly and all of a sudden they start acting weird. Again there is no correct way to present. There's only the balance between what you're comfortable with, and what will keep you safe."

I've only ever reached the date two times. While setting a date feels macabre, it keeps you from acting on impulse. All of my previous attempts before I started setting dates happened because I was in the middle of a panic attack or ptsd breakdown and I couldn't handle it. It has legit kept me alive. If you decide to do this and ever actually reach the date, call Trans Lifeline (**877-565-8860)**. They've saved me a few times.

The dynamic between Maki and his dad feels realistic. Same with the PTSDish symptoms. Maki's subtle expressions and body language hit a little too close to home. Toma's famiIy dynamics are super interesting, and I also love the growing camraderie that the team is building.

That said, I'm having really mixed feelings about this show. I love the characters. There's been so many beautiful moments. The pacing is way too fast though.

But if you have too many heavy things happening one after another, it runs the risk of veering into melodrama even if all the individual parts are really solid. A story needs room to breathe.

I feel like this show has enough beautiful things to say that it deserved 24 episodes, and I'm worried all of that will get condensed in a way that robs it of it's power."

Refusing to use this student's pronouns has a similar effect."

SuicideWatch,eyxqsub,t1_eyxqfpj,1567560198.0,"I guess if there is anything positive to pull from this, it's that if any of y'all are able to recover the hopeless evaporates. The question is the if. I know people in my life that have been able to do it, but it feels impossible a lot of the time."
SuicideWatch,eyxqfpj,t3_cz9m9q,1567559934.0,"So I kind of feel like I'm in an odd situation with this as a bipolar person.   


My thought patterns are different when I'm depressed. Suicide seems logical, and there is literally nothing anyone can say to convince me otherwise.   


When I come out of it, the thought of dying seems bizarre to me though. All of the arguments for dying make no sense.  


Honestly the brief moments of feeling better make it worse. When I'm depressed I know what I'm missing, and when I'm manic I still know that I'm going to be back to being suicidal soon, so it's hard to enjoy it."

ask_transgender,ey0l611,t3_cuqkoc,1566680375.0,"Ok, so if she is seriously planning on doing this then there's a decent chance that she is either already suicidal or at least actively doesn't care about the risk. 

When I'm in that head space people making traditional logical arguments doesn't work. I would tell her that even if she somehow managed to pull it of, since she isn't experienced in doing that procedure she could be wrecking her chances of having a successful bottom surgery in the future. I thought about trying to castrate myself when I was her age, and while I was ok with risking death at the time, I wasn't willing to risk giving up on ever being able to have vaginoplasty."

I've talked to so many people that have struggled with mental health issues for years that still worry that they're deep down only doing it for attention. Saying that people are faking is so toxic."

I recommend checking out Murray Bookchin's essays for the former, and Conquest of Bread by Peter Kropotkin for the latter if you want to learn more about left libertarianism."

I also recommend looking into the concept of capitalist realism. We've been indoctrinated to believe that capitalism is like an inevitable law of nature, and deconstructing that is necessary to convince people another world is possible"
