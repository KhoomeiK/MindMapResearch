I had to try 6 different meds before I found one that worked because I didn't have depression, I was bipolar.

Track your moods.  Are you down and out when something bad happens? (ADHD)

Do you get depressed for no reason (Major Depressive Disorder)

Do you worry constantly and burn yourself out (anxiety)

Do you have mood swings (bipolar)

Also, get checked out by the doctors for physical problems like heart, digestive, thyroid etc.

It's not normal to feel the way you do, but there's a way to fix it.  Treatment almost never works the first time around.

Therapists are shit.  Reddit does more for me than therapy does.

You care about your friends and probably your family too, so don't give up.  Find what works.  That's what everyone wants and you care about them, don't you?"
