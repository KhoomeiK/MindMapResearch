stripper,fr1xg4y,t1_fr1wks2,1589827571.0,Ugh I knoww I used to just sit at the bar observing and learning from the other dancers bc that feeling of discomfort and awkwardness ate me ALIVE
stripper,fr1wb0p,t3_gm3wf3,1589827010.0,"Agreed , my friend who got me into dancing gave me a rundown multiple times bc I felt that it helped with preparing myself, but she kept reminding me “it’s nothing you can understand till you’re in there doing it”. And I rlly thought I knew it all until I was in there by myself on a Saturday night not knowing wtf was going on"
NarcissisticAbuse,fr11wyn,t3_glx1nt,1589811646.0,"TDLR: Don’t feed into this. All the progress you’ve made with yourself will be thrown in the trash and lit on fire, it’ll only prolong the moving on process and most likely will fuck it up even more. You’re a badass bitch:) remember it, stay confident and don’t let anyone fuck with you, especially a shitty ex. Focus on your money, passionate hobbies, things that make your soul feel full, bc I can assure you he will not be providing that feeling 


This sorta happened to me, ex of almost 2 years came back after dumping me for the 2nd time and ignoring me for 5 months, popped in during May last year and talked me into being FWB. I agreed bc I still loved him a lot and wanted his attention even tho I told myself FUCKING STOP THIS IS BAD, we fucked  for abt 1.5 months, texted eachother every single day. 

By September my head was so fucked with bc I knew he didn’t want more than my body and it hurt me bad, I cried literally every time I left his house, hotels, or wherever we hungout 

I started getting more clingy and angry  abt the whole thing which pissed him off, except I couldn’t ever ignore him when he texted me or tell him no to having sex bc I needed his validation. 

I finally went tf off on him and told him I can’t fuck him anymore bc I still cared so much (couldn’t use the word love anymore cuz he didn’t see it like that), and I got “that’s straight we can still hangout here and there” and slowly started texting me less and less. 2 weeks went by and I called him out on ghosting me as soon as I mentioned no more sex, it was pretty ironic considering he always told me  “he still cares and it’s not just about sex”. 

We had a “talk about it” which entailed of me sitting in the car glaring out the window while he smoked a bowl and bitched that I was “trippin for thinking I got ghosted, he was just busy”

Went off on him one more time the day after, told him he’s a piece of shit, and then ignored his response which felt good. However, a month went by and I felt that I had to explain myself for acting the way I did for some dumb fucking reason, tried explaining I freaked out bc I still cared a lot and it was messing with my emotions. He ignored it and that was back in November, haven’t heard shit from him since and probably won’t and it’s been really difficult to deal with."

careeradvice,fpw5l3w,t1_fptki6o,1588957649.0,"I started doing hair because I thought it was something I’ve always wanted to , but this was a dream I had when I was like in middle school. I kinda fell back on it after I realized at 19 that college seemed impossible, and beauty school seemed like the easier alternative. 

As with art, my mother has her bachelors in art history so I grew up with it my whole life. I love the process, I love the finished result, I love creating trippy/abstract work to inspire others. I’ve been drawing since I was 5 and art just truly fills up my soul, I’m always viewing the world as a photograph or a painting..there’s Art to be found everywhere. I definitely have thought about graphic design , it’s just taking that first leap is what scares me the most. I’m scared of leaving my shitty job that I make good money at to start a whole new career that would make me happy but be broke 

Thank you for your advice!"

mentalhealth,fpq8k2p,t3_gexn9d,1588817343.0,"I’ve suffered from depression for a very long time, I was diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder and the best thing for me was therapy. I’m 22 now and started when I was 17, and now on medication. A good psychologist can help her discover where her trauma comes from, and help navigate her way towards self-improvement and healing. I also suggest writing, I’ve been journaling for YEARS and it helps me to sort out my feelings, it’s also been great to look back and see how far I’ve come. I try to write five things everyday that I should be grateful for, it helps me focus on the good things in life rather than the negative. Being a teenager and having to deal with it  also sucks because your hormones are already out of whack. As for helping her with words, just be a shoulder for her to cry on when she needs to and assure her that you’ll be there for her through thick and thin."
