She explained that there were not enough hangers for all her stuff when she got home. She walks into any room, takes off her coat and places it on a hanger. Then hangs it up and puts her shoes beneath it. It was in the first few days that she realized she was late. She started freaking out and having panic attacks, as she unfortunately does, and said she needed to get a pregnancy test. Her  having panic attacks forced her boyfriend of the time to go out and get one for her. Apparently he remembered the hangers and the one other thing he'd forgotten in the move, new towels. So, in order, he set down a pregnancy test, a new pack of hangers and towels."

This woman would have to over power a 30yr old man, asphyxiate him and then proceed to partially bury him. That takes a lot of strength and while women can indeed be quite formidable and strong, it does seem highly unlikely."
RBI,fo25u7a,t3_g57t5f,1587450674.0,"Expanding on what's already been said, I believe there is a distinct possibility these are related. or at least some are. I would love to see a map of where the person's were when they were killed/found and where they had started. Many serial killers enjoy the hunt of the individual but will also do everything in their power to be  undetected. Because the AT has a huge number of hikers, it therefore would have a veritable smorgasbord of victims to a killer. 

The fact that two murders happened in nearly the same place could be, but is very likely not a coincidence. Serial murderers will often stalk the same grounds because they are comfortable with the environment. This could account also for where the victim is first apprehended or murdered but their body may be dumped a distance away. 

Dumping a body tells you a few things about the killer. 1) they are strong enough to lug the dead weight of a body
2) they are significantly larger than the victim
3) they utilize a weapon as a tactic to ensure compliance and force the victim to go to the dump site themselves

It also serves to show that this is not their first rodeo. They have likely committed violent acts before and found that hiding the evidence- burying, burning, dropping it in water - erases evidence.

Lastly from what I've just heard about the missing man's wallet, I speculate you are dealing with someone with Antisocial Personality disorder (commonly laypeople, lawyers and the like call them ""psychopaths"") as they seem to have no regard for the others. but what is really telling is that he/she (most likely a he as women serial killers make up less than 10% worldwide)
Also has extreme narcissistic traits, believing to be smarter and better than those trying to find him or what happened. It is akin to following someone looking for you in a game of 'hide and seek'. 

Note that leaving the wallet was 
a) purposeful and meant to send a message (further indicating the presence of a serial offender
b) it's a significant trait of narcissism and feeling untouchable
c) is not a normative trait of ASPD (psychopathy) 

if someone who could plot the points of entry and of where the bodies were found, as well as the method of killing, I figure I could work out more about the ""hunting field"" and the psychological make-up of the offender.

It should also be noted this could take place under the following other circumstances
a) 2 or more individuals working together
b) a copy cat killer 
c) a very rare coincidence that is statically unlikely"

MMFB,fnobqsv,t3_g2vu87,1587119623.0,"As others have already stated, I'm glad to hear that you haven't gone through with it. I have burn scars across my hands, wounds on my arms, and have hurt myself many times, and you know the worst part? I did nothing to help my mood or affect my negative feelings. It is an impulse decision and I'm glad you're able to stop before  going through with it.

I think what's most important for you are a few key takeaways:

1) Many if not most people have self-harm thoughts. You are not alone. I personally struggle with harm OCD where thoughts of harming myself or others just come into my mind randomly and I tend to dwell on them. which brings me to point 2.

2) They are just thoughts. You don't need to act on them. we all have weird thoughts from time to time and if we agreed on the thoughts all the time our whole world would be one messed up place. Try framing your thoughts to have a better perspective. like ""my brain is telling me to hurt myself"" this allows you to distance yourself and not feel like something has to be done.

3) Ask for help. Especially if the thoughts become overpowering, but find someone you trust and tell them about your thoughts and how they make you feel. it could be a friend, family member or professional. It's really important to talk to others, even though it's uncomfortable because they may be able to help if things get really bad while at the same time keeping you accountable for your actions.

4) look into thought patterns. Try writing down what you feel or think of directly before these thoughts occur. this will help you to know what precipitates the self-harm ideation and will help you manage more effectively. by knowing what thoughts make you feel like doing it, you can begin to ""ride the wave"" (experience the negative state without resorting to negative coping like self-harm) and also institute more positive coping like exercise, fidget toys, talking to others etc.

5) lastly,  if the urges get to be so bad that you cannot control them, or feel you are going to do serious harm. call for help or go to the hospital immediately."

1) 40% risk of developing schizophrenia is less than half , i.e. pick a side of a coin to be schizophrenia and flip it. You have less than that chance of developing. Also considering your other siblings it may way something about the generic heritability of schizophrenia in your family


2) social isolation is caused by so many things that I really wouldn't worry about it being presymptomatic, it is also high school so socializing is important but very hard. Don't get too down on yourself


3) onset rapidly increases in later teens, early 20s in women, and if you do have it at least you've done homework on it


4) don't do any drugs that are hallucinogens or marijuana, there are studies indicating the use of such drugs increasing risk of schizophrenia and inducing psychotic states. 


5) be careful with all this research, it sounds like it has become a compulsion and may need to be addressed. I did the same thing growing up reading the DSM and case studies trying to understand what's w with me, only to recently discover it was a symptom of OCD.

And I know how you feel about people thinking their shitty comics are a retirement fund. Searching Craigslist every one is asking hundreds or thousands for their unbagged smashed 90s comics. Ughhh"
AskReddit,fj2djzg,t3_fayx6x,1582940918.0,I went to a comic convention to challenge my anxiety. Someone from my treatment center met me. It was fun but really hard. Ever since I've walked out I've been trying not to break down
comicbookcollecting,fj295qo,t1_fj22rjz,1582937698.0,That's awesome!
comicbookcollecting,fj1wpr2,t1_fj1r76t,1582929507.0,Thanks!
comicbookcollecting,fj1wpa7,t1_fj1tpi1,1582929498.0,Thanks!
comicbookcollecting,fj1qs8x,t1_fj1pf82,1582925733.0,"Didn't realize that I had to check in at CGC and when I did figure it out (an hour ago) I was told I had a 5 hour wait. Wtf. I'm really bummed that I just walked around, I didn't wanna spend the money I had for grading and I don't have friends so it was really hard to see all these groups of happy people. But I went. So that's an accomplishment"
AcademicPsychology,fj1qjzm,t1_fj152ax,1582925589.0,"I'm not one to tell you a definitive answer to this. You could apply for a ph.d. and get a master's while doing it I believe. Some programs look down on applicants with master's getting a pH.d. as to why I have no idea. You'll need to study and take the gre. If you're good at memorizing vocab and have a good memory of basic alegbra and geometry you will do okay. It's a beast of a test though. I would recommend reaching out to one of the professors at Depaul or a school that you like and ask them what track to take. It was build a relationship, get a good response and it will help you when you apply, you can ask that person to advocate for you."

It seems your method paid off. Glad you got them done and that they look so clean. You're making me feel like I should finally start my retro 1 vachetta project."
comicbookcollecting,fitl9g7,t1_firw509,1582723313.0,Awesome thanks so much
AcademicPsychology,firss6y,t3_f9ddfa,1582670584.0,"From a read-through of your ideas and desires i would recommend you look into social psychology and community psychology. Both overlap with what you are talking about. And I know one researcher at Depaul University in Chicago who essentially studies the best methods of community engagement in mental health practice. While in a grad program you will likely be expected to take a few classes outside you track, this would be a good time to focus on sociology which I think would help a lot in understanding the effects of race, see, gender, identity etc. On communities in the context of inclusion and to some degree success in a capitalist economic system. Check some out and let me know what you think."
comicbookcollecting,firqz6n,t1_fire4ax,1582669679.0,Oh good to know!
comicbookcollecting,firqvho,t1_fir5736,1582669632.0,Where would I find a presser/cleaner?
comicbookcollecting,fir4t7v,t1_fir26mf,1582657378.0,Woah that's a big difference lol. How long are they pressing these books lol
