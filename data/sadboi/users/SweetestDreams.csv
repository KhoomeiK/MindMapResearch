Cause I thought you were fighting for, quote “puberty blockers for everyone who need it” which you think mean everyone who says they need it and I think should only be reserved for kids with physical disorder. And I don’t know where you got that last sentence from. I study medicine and am well aware what informed consent is. 

And lbr until there are peer reviewed studies done on substantial sample sizes on the effects of puberty blockers on trans minors I’m not gonna call anecdotal cases “evidence based medicine” and call for all trans kids to have access to the same treatment.

TrueOffMyChest,fj61ccw,t1_fj60yyo,1583051879.0,You do have a point but at the end of the day it’s gonna come down to the doctor treating each specific case to weigh the pros and cons of using puberty blockers on a “normal” minor body and to decide whether they wanna go that route or not.

TrueOffMyChest,fj60mk1,t1_fj609q5,1583050921.0,"Thing is, I don’t think any minor *need* puberty blockers unless they have a physical disorder which cause them to start puberty early, for example CAH.

The acting from the main 3 women (the Baker family) is pretty solid, the storylines are really dramatic and soap-opera-y at times but tbh it’s kind of my guilty pleasure. 

Good as entertainment and though not all loose ends were tied up I think the viewers can easily draw up their own conclusion from what the show gave us"
SpinningOut,fin86cz,t1_fdtdx2w,1582558014.0,Seriously?

Really didn’t dig the narration and I felt the ending was kinda anti-climatic? The old witch was defeated too easily? I kinda hope they’d show more of the girl learning magic and get more corrupted so there would be more conflict and more dramatic at the end.

I felt like it has elements of visual from The Neon Demon and a similar story/vibe to The Witch with a fairy-tale like atmosphere... overall enjoyable movie.

P/s: Marta DID carry naloxone but Ransom took it when he was switching the meds, not sure how you missed that 🤔"
movies,f9bcicl,t1_f9bboby,1575211320.0,"No, according to the statements from the family Walt and his son were the last people to see Harlan alive. Walt even testified that Marta left at midnight and he saw his father alive a quarter after midnight. It’s almost like you didn’t even watch the movie.

And yes, she made a big mistake and should have her license revoked but in-universe, in the movie, it was midnight, she had a long day and already had a glass of champagne, so she overlooked things. Not saying she was justified, but the movie gave enough details for the situation to be believable."
movies,f9b9qpl,t1_f9atxzf,1575210557.0,But he didn’t tho and that’s kinda the point. And even if Marta was questioned she had an alibi. Normal cops like in the movie would not press further because even the family didn’t want to pursue it more

The twist is that Ransom switched the meds to indirectly kill Harlan by Marta’s hands but she switched the meds again thanks to her muscle memory and instincts thus giving Harlan the right drug from the wrong vial."
movies,f9ao19h,t1_f9amn7b,1575204684.0,"Yes but the movie already established that in-universe, the local, average cops were ready to rule it as a simply suicide (which was technically true), the family members didn’t want to pursue it further cause they just wanted the inheritance.

Marta was freaking out because she thought she just killed her patient and friend AND she couldn’t find the antidote, if she actually found the antidote she’d probably give that to him, calm down and then realize that Harlan wasn’t overdosing at all. Harlan didn’t have the medical knowledge and experience thus he took Marta’s words at face value. Again, when your primary medical professional says she just gave you an opioid overdose and you’re sure dead in 10 minutes you’re gonna believe it. Also Fran could have been a morphine user with a stronger tolerance. We’re shown she smokes weed and likes to drink so it’s not entirely out of left field

2. One idea that pops up in the film is “it’s not about Marta deserving it, but that the Thrombeys don’t at all”. And anyhow, Harlan gave her 60M, if she’s not gonna be super stupid about it, she’d probably be fine. She is not a greedy person, she could even just sell the publishing company and live far more than comfortably with 60M and a mansion"
