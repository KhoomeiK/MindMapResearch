Pre-internet, it was this guy that you didn't like showing up to parties & watched carefully when he did. Almost always, he'd eventually get rude with a young lady & be dealt with accordingly.

Pocatello, Idaho. Sometime around 1998 +/- a year or so, one of my buddies was living in a really shitty, sketchy apartment building. He'd been there for about 3 weeks when the next door neighbor comes a'knocking. Says he's gotta blow town because he's wanted on warrants & is facing a long stretch in prison or something like that. Hands my buddy a cardboard box full of random stuff & says something like, ""I've seen your friends, you guys will like this stuff,"" then just walks out of the building, never to be seen (by us) again.

My buddy goes through the box & it's just random junk, broken bongs, nothing special. At the bottom of the box is this tee-shirt, with the collar & sleeve-cuffs already cut off. My buddy was way too big to wear it, but he brought it to our house to show us this weird treasure. My wife & I somewhat dishonestly ""borrow"" it with very little intention of ever returning it (though, technically, to this day, it is only on loan even though we live several states away).

I haven't met any since the early 90's, they were few & far between, & the ones I met were self-described ""Satan Worshippers"". They were theists/deists who actively worshipped the Christian devil. They got caught up in the shock value of the 80's/90's ""Satanic Panic"" but were quite earnest in their beliefs, black magic, & claimed to practice animal sacrifice. To me they came off as somewhere between poseurs & mentally ill on a case-by-case basis. Very few were adults that I met, I should add.

It was crazy, suddenly in the mid to late 90's & beyond these people were everywhere handing out leaflets/brochures & inviting us to church while we were grocery shopping (we  were leatherclad punk rockers with crazy hair & piercings, nobody's demographic). A lot of my Mom's friends left their 12-step groups because the church said they were satanic, other churches lost membership, some of our old friends got saved, the whole bit.

When's the last time you heard about someone getting shot in a parking lot trying to score some porno?

How many homeless panhandlers do you truly believe are going right to the porn shop as soon as they get $20 together?

Who's willing to suck a stranger's dick to get access to porn?

Who's robbing liquor stores for smut money?

Who's killing low-level porn dealers to steal their stash?

C'mon, man, this kind of hyperbole is just silly. Porn is as old as cave paintings, it hasn't caused the end of humanity or depopulation in any discernible way. If someone's relationship is falling apart ""because of porn"", they've got a lot of other underlying issues to address."
