carporn,fkuij6j,t1_fkuex46,1584550061.0,Sweet! My dad has a '57 so I noticed the grill right away
carporn,fkuepzp,t3_fkr11q,1584548028.0,Is that a '55 with a '57 grill? Cause the body is the same but that's a '57 grill.
seduction,fhp86i6,t1_fhp6mhr,1581784052.0,It took a friend of mine pointing it out to me for me to notice so don't feel bad
seduction,fhp6bxl,t1_fhp56r9,1581783020.0,I had a girl once come sit next to me at an event and she kept telling me her hands were cold the whole night (we were outside). It wasn't until like a week later that I realized she was wanting me to grab her hand. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
seduction,fhov1ci,t3_f44xzp,1581774796.0,Being to nice/friendly. And missing completely obvious signs. Will never forgive my for missing those.
seduction,fgnqf13,t1_fgnq104,1580950593.0,"That's part of what's been eating me up. I've been thinking about it as ""I rather feel the pain of rejection than this pain of regret"" for future reference."
seduction,fgni1fm,t1_fgng69v,1580945319.0,Does this apply even if it's a month or so before I would see her again?
seduction,fgnhxp3,t1_fgngbav,1580945259.0,"The friends were drinking and giving some pretty bad advice to be honest lol but I understand what you are saying. I'm trying to adapt the ""what's the worst that can happen"" and ""fuck it"" ideas into my life."
dating,fgc8ryw,t1_fgbt9kl,1580670254.0,"You're right. My problem is I'm introverted and shy. So even when I do get out, I stay in the corner and away from the crowd and can't build the courage to talk to any girls."
dating,fgbq1xv,t3_exoqcu,1580664930.0,It definitely doesn't help it. Being introverted and shy cost me and opportunity with an amazing girl last night. I hate how shy I am most of the time.

PinStriping,fcn0ny3,t3_ei2l5b,1577799819.0,Trying to get back to practicing myself. What is that that you are practicing on? Looks like a great tool for practice!
rccars,fbe8w35,t3_ectpxh,1576780828.0,"Although I have an original SMT10 heavily modified, I'll probably still pick up one of these because of how awesome the platform is."
NoFap,fae6t8n,t3_e8dvnw,1575994951.0,"As someone who is trying to get over a girl he never even had in the first place, the first part of this hit hard and felt like it was written specifically for me."
PcBuild,f9i4z0r,t1_f9hzy3p,1575328390.0,"Hahahahahaha, well maybe I need to look up Crysis to see what it is"

PcBuild,f9g1rek,t1_f9fdawd,1575291602.0,I'm pretty new to PC building. This build is mainly for editing and 3D modeling with a few games here and there. What is crysis?

PcBuild,f3zfg76,t1_f3z1qv9,1571268260.0,Thanks for the tips. After some research I've decided to go with the 2080 super instead since it's actually 100$ less than the one I had in my build. I've also found another hard drive that someone recommended online. I'll look at the ssd. Thanks again for the input!
psychology,f3xvf87,t1_f3wnaxd,1571244478.0,"I did the same thing. It almost felt kinda poetically ironic (don't know if that's a thing, just what I've been calling it) to see it by myself."
PcBuild,f3tlbkh,t1_f3swakf,1571138747.0,Any specific reasons why for the hard drive and ssd? I'm going with the rtx 2080 since it's what's recommended for the things I do in Davinci Resolve.
thanksimcured,f3gidj9,t3_dgwsqw,1570911703.0,I do all of these things and still have some pretty horrible thoughts and feelings all of the time. I'm not saying I have any kind of mental illness but just doing these kinda things will not always make you feel better.
seduction,f3en993,t3_dgrkbz,1570882622.0,Well I was coming here to tell you I did the same thing last week by going to the movies by myself. But you went way beyond what I did. Awesome job
seduction,f353yu8,t1_f34xawp,1570667831.0,Awesome advice! Needed to hear this myself.
BlackPeopleTwitter,f24gm32,t3_dbi2ta,1569951568.0,I feel personally attacked by this.
mentalhealth,ewgatyk,t3_co584f,1565377730.0,I run as well and I actually started just as a way to get away from the world. I don't know why but running makes me forget about everything. Hope it does the same for you too!
mentalhealth,ewf3vf4,t1_ewds8aa,1565350138.0,"Unfortunately I talked with my parents last night and although they didn't straight up say it, they basically told me they don't want me to go back to that job since it's not enough pay to be a career. I'm just gonna be miserable until I can get a better job I guess. Thanks for your help anyways."
mentalhealth,ewdrxe9,t1_ewce4js,1565306355.0,Thanks for the advice. That is exactly what my gut feeling has been but I guess I wanted others' perspectives. I tried talking to the higher up at the company about maybe moving to something I would enjoy more and would use my degree and I basically just got the runaround. Thanks again for your thoughts!
rccars,euc2c7y,t1_eubiydv,1563663152.0,Good to know
rccars,eu62l8s,t1_eu5gigf,1563490765.0,Hmmm. May be a packaging mistake or something. I'd try to return it.
rccars,eu5fwm5,t3_cewnwh,1563476707.0,"I think the measurement is center to center of the ""ball"" on each side, or pin to pin. Try that and see if it's closer to that 57mm."

rccars,epqmfkp,t3_bvf9p8,1559408461.0,"Do you talk to the owners of the track before running on it? There is a track about an hour away from where I live and I've gone a few times but its always covered with tarps. I don't want to just remove them and run on it, even though I'd put them back, cause I don't want to do something the owners wouldn't allow. I've thought about contacting them, just curious what others do."
rccars,epqlp5f,t3_bviv12,1559408049.0,Looks really cool and seems to perform well. May have to save up a little and try one out and maybe make a video comparing it to other mini or micro crawlers. Price is just a little too high for me right now after just buying a new RC.
rccars,ep7914i,t3_bu5jo5,1559078817.0,Mainly watch out for the diffs if you end up getting one. Most of them need to be shimmed out of the box.
rccars,eozfh70,t1_eoxobq8,1558960285.0,"I have no experience with the tactic transmitter so I cannot give an honest opinion on it. Arrma is now a Horizon Hobby company which is likely why they switched to the Spektrum system. This is the same transmitter that comes with many of the new Axial rigs, including the new Wraith 1.9. I haven't seen many people talk bad about the Wraith 1.9 because of the transmitter because, like I mentioned above, most people ditch the stock radio system anyway. I don't think I've ever bought a RTR and ""enjoyed"" the transmitter it came with. I think most companies realize people will use their own stuff anyway, so they go cheaper on the radio system. Hope this cleared up my thinking a little, I was not trying to say this Spektrum is better than the Tactic as I don't have experience with both."
rccars,eoxo0wp,t1_eoqwsot,1558926611.0,"Like I mentioned above, although it might not be a top of the line radio, I think its perfectly fine for a RTR so that the overall cost stays down. I will personally be removing the radio system to use my own stuff as I, and a bunch of others in the hobby, use one transmitter for multiple vehicles. If giving my opinion on a truck and having fun bashing it around makes me a kid, then I want to be a kid forever! Thanks for your thoughts!"
rccars,eoxn9yd,t1_eoqluij,1558926329.0,I don't think its the best radio in the world but I also don't think its a bad option for a RTR rig to keep the price down. Thanks for your feedback though!
3Dprinting,eoa2ncp,t1_eo512jh,1558405851.0,"What I have linked above is just about everything you need. Only other things that would be needed is whatever battery you would want to use as well as any radio system you may have or can get cheap. As for assembly, I have a video where I go through and build the entire car after everything is finished printing. Its a pretty easy build that I think even someone new to RC can accomplish. Best of luck!
