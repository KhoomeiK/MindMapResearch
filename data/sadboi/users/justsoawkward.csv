Routine(ish): 
Clarifying wash: Davines Solu, once every...3 months or so?
Shampoo: As I Am Olive & Tea Tree Cowash every 3 washes 
Conditioner: okay, I'm mixing here. I've got a Shea Moisture Make It Last that I'm not sold on (SO THICK), so I've been mixing Shea Moisture Moisture Retention Conditioner with Eden Bodyworks Split End Repair Mask, leave it in while I soap up/shave, and then rinse out most of it. 
Style: while still in the shower, I spray on the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey+Yogurt Leave In, work through the Shea Moisture Make It Last Curl Primer while upside down, and then finish off with the Shea Moisture Make It Last Defining Gel Oil.
Dry: wrap it in a DevaCurl microfiber towel until makeup/clothes are done and then let it drip/air dry.

OBVIOUSLY this routine is not working so well. 

VERY IMPORTANT - I'm newly engaged and need this hair to be on point for photos and whatnot as things progress.

They have families and homes and cars and bills and everything takes money, and they're still getting paid, so they do what they gotta do. 

I agree - they should definitely be giving the company the finger and walking out. But I think the depression around the office is another thing preventing anyone from getting fired up enough to leave. There is a palpable heaviness in the office building and it's really horrible."
