Panic is your 'fight or flight' response going off in non life threatening situations. Sooooo, you can't get away cuz everywhere you go, there you are and fighting it increases your adrenaline and makes it worse. Accept it, Accept it, Accept it. 

Try the 'Friend method'. If you were riding in a car with your friend and they said to you; "" my feet are tingling"" and ""my neck is getting stiff"" and ect.... Would you say to that friend,  ""Oh Shit, I think your gonna die, it's over your fucked""????? No of course not, you would be positive and consoling.
