This group of people (Twitch staff) have already previously been established as a group that deserves to be insulted, and will be. With that stated, at least a couple of them look like extremely stereotypical ""white chishet male"" haters. I'm not saying that they are, just that if anyone is looking for what could be considered stereotypical examples of ""white chishet male"" haters by the internet.

My personal opinion in general is that if you demonstrate yourself to be worthy of insult in the first place without any input from anyone else, there is no real reason any specific insult needs to be off-limits. Looking like ""white chishet male"" haters is just a low-hanging fruit for a group of people that was going to be insulted (by their own actions) anyway.

Let me propose a question. Is there any moral or ethical reason not to insult a Twitch employee who is severely and dangerously out of touch with reality? It doesn't matter if they're men or women. The only relevant part is that they work for Twitch and Twitch is currently toxic."

**Because we already established them as fair game for being insulted**, resorting to attacking their appearances is just low-hanging fruit. Not necessarily being judgemental. Just because you can watch and laugh at someone literally leaning into stereotypes doesn't make you a bad person. 

I guess what I mean is, to me personally, there's a difference between making fun of someone's appearance because they're a proven and demonstrated degenerate asshole and making fun of someone's appearance solely because they are a woman.

True, it's 2-3 times the size of a chicken nugget, but their strips are also 2-3 times smaller than traditional chicken strips. I'm not complaining like an American fatass here, I'm just saying it's worth keeping that in mind when you consider the price. For the amount of meat you get per strip, I'd say they aren't worth more than decent chicken wings. You can find pretty good wings from several places for around 50¢/wing.

Comparing the meat and the other individual items included to competitors in the same market, I personally came up with a ""fair"" market price of $20 for this deal, so I can easily see how they settled on $25.

We have 7 employees and got approved in the first round. We applied on Day 1 and meticulously provided every document requested. Old National Bank has done the opposite.

I know of at least 2 businesses nearby that have closed up shop without reopening dates solely because of the way Old National handled it."
smallbusiness,fonpfg9,t1_fno2vuc,1587923901.0,"It's confusing seeing comments like that at the top on so many of these threads. What do these people need? Do they need to see a screenshot of the loan entering my account and copies of our employees' W2s to prove we have less than 10 employees and got approved?

These people almost come off as those disaster false flag conspiracy nuts, but this time it's hard to understand since we actually did get approved for something that they are claiming doesn't exist.

Only fat cat big businesses my ass. Us still being in business is directly contrary to that. I think the more important factor is which bank you happened to be with when this all went down, because our bank went above and beyond for us. Not even a local bank, it's fucking regional."

smallbusiness,fonn10z,t1_fok9l33,1587922614.0,"I'm thankful our business already made the move last year. I should call that shitty bank and thank them for denying my brother a $2,000 car loan when he almost could have afforded to buy the car outright. That was the sole reason we ditched them.

I honestly don't understand what they were thinking if they wanted to keep our account. If you have a successful family business with an account that has been active for over 30 years, you might want to stop and consider your options before you deny the owner's son a loan for no reason."
smallbusiness,fonmpib,t1_folalz4,1587922442.0,"Last year one of our banks denied my brother a car loan without a legitimate reason. Our family business also happened to use that bank and uprooted after 34 years with them and switched to a new bank as soon as this happened. We of course went inside to let them know that their greed and indifference over a $2,000 loan is why they lost an entire successful and active business account.

I remember this story even more fondly now, because our new bank went through great lengths to help us with the first round of SBA, and we got approved. Other businesses in our industry that used the other bank have gotten denied."
smallbusiness,fonlxso,t1_fonjti3,1587922028.0,From everything I've been reading today it sounds like our business practically won the lottery by getting approved for the first round of SBA loans. We're a small business with a sole owner and 7 total employees.
smallbusiness,fonkwjv,t1_fon5j6v,1587921451.0,"This is the best way to go. If you're sub-only it closes off a huge group of demographics from even acknowledging you exist. For my business I've spent in upwards of 25-30 hours looking for a purchasable alternative to some software I needed that became sub-only. I eventually did find what I was looking for, but I still probably would have spent 2 or 3 times longer looking before conceded and subscribed or cancelled the project altogether."
smallbusiness,fonkmuj,t1_folu4w3,1587921302.0,"That may work for some. I require the control to be on the user end though. I enjoy the freedom of being able to pay once, not worry about it, and upgrade down the line if I am even still using it. I'm tech savvy enough not to use V2 of something that just released V12.

Being tech savvy is probably what drives my anti-subscription mindset though, so I'm hardly an ""average consumer"" on that end. Still though, to this day I have refused to even acknowledge the existence of sub-only software/online services, let alone utilize them."

I wouldn't say this has bothered people so much as the original posters of this type of content just trying to create a big enough splash/fuss about specific asshole celebs so we can more easily know which actors to blacklist once this all blows over.

Ellen for example. I have no opinion of her one way or another, but the very fact that she participated in the ""celebs crying in mansions"" meme is enough for me to avoid any content that features her forever.

The celebs need to get a fucking grip on reality and stop being so desperate to be the center of attention. We have people losing their homes and property, multi-generation family businesses being erased, budding careers and retirement plans ripped to the backburner, essential supply shortages, less talked about but in extroverts you see mental problems cropping up due to extreme social isolation, and worst of all family and friends literally being killed by this thing and families being ripped apart.

To these asshole celebs, we do not need to be reminded of your existence during this trying time. Stop deepthroating your own ego."

SuicideWatch,foef9ur,t1_focgsj7,1587702341.0,"That's not even close to the same thing at all. I guess someone could go super far out on a limb and claim that the artist is mentally self-harming themselves through creating their work and that the readers through consuming it, but no children are harmed from these drawings and animations.

Lolicon content is reported out of personal disgust. CP that is reported is different. Almost every unique file reported is the life of a different child ruined forever.

We can debate the psychological effects of creating and/or consuming said content, but the subject matter itself is victimless. Was the content created through the harm of children? Objectively, no. Does the content itself cause verifiable negative psychological effects? That's what should be debated. I don't personally think that anything should be considered a felony solely because a voting majority considers it ""icky"". A crime requires a victim. If there is no victim, no wrong was done."
SuicideWatch,foedfjt,t1_focqn93,1587701135.0,"There were two things that you should have done, and should do in the future if you ever come across it again. First, confirm that you found CP on social media. Second, If it's just that one account, report them and move on. If it looks like a whole group of pedos exchanging files (what you came across it seems) through multiple accounts, report the activity in general to the admins/support and move on.

Even though it's justified and morally more than ok to do, repeatedly exposing yourself to graphic child sexual abuse to report each individual account is probably not the best thing to do if you're schizoaffective. It's someone's job to take down this kind of horrific trash. You should only feel obligated to go far enough to make sure that those people are aware of what's happening.

It's far better than doing nothing at all, and you won't have to expose yourself to anything but the first image you came across."
