Life really is unfair I guess, I just wish we could get more, idk I would have been happy with some 2 minute sequence of Sean narrating what turn his life took after the events at the border"
lifeisstrange,fjdtom6,t1_fjds32r,1583259045.0,"Yeah you have to agree to his shitty heist idea to kiss him regardless of your choices that’s a bummer.

Also I agree apparently depression was their goal but without the sense of closure I got from the first season, at least Chloe got an amazing funeral sequence or we knew that she’d be fine with max hitting the road.
Honestly I don’t know if that was some kind of artistic choice or a major mistake in story-writing.

It’s like they wanted us to feel like shit no matter what, maybe that’s the strange part of life is strange, meh"
lifeisstrange,fjdpjly,t1_fjdnrih,1583256734.0,"Also yeah they’re just games but books are just books and movies are just movies, still I am devastated every time something shitty happens to a character I get attached to, humans will be humans and develop emotional bonds with anything or something I guess

Also am I the only one who was sad about the whole lyla having a breakdown thing and how there’s no chance to contact her after episode 2? I would have loved being able to know more about how she was doing"
lifeisstrange,fjdoyvx,t1_fjdnrih,1583256417.0,"I basically agree with everything you just said and yeah I am too still emotional about the ending(s)

I also hated Daniel for most of the game but started liking him after the cult debacle, so basically I enjoyed his existence just in the last episode and making the finale all about his future and shit was a bit unfair indeed. 

Also yeah I wish we got more of Sean in the finale where he meets up with the gang (other complaint here about how the player is guided by the game into romancing Cassidy over Finn but that’s just me being an angry queer but the scene at the fire where you could kinda make Sean come out as bi melted my dead heart).

And yeah I thought they would be lifted by Daniel over the wall I mean he can smash a metal wall, make cars fly without batting an eye, levitate a tree the size of my entire house and he couldn’t like take that shitty pickup over a 30ft wall? Fuck this"
lifeisstrange,fjd9yte,t1_fjcc1ay,1583248958.0,"The whole falling in love with the road angle is actually something I had totally overlooked, but yeah most likely it’s the best possible outcome for Sean and him reuniting with the California gang gives some hope"
lifeisstrange,fjd9rdy,t1_fjd8mnx,1583248832.0,"Totally, also I’ve been listening to the songs featured in the game just because I like to feel miserable or something"
lifeisstrange,fjbf140,t1_fjbebw6,1583191840.0,"Yeah probably my favorite too, still I had this image of him reuniting with lyla in Seattle and going back to a somewhat normal existence.

But yeah totally Daniel gets a shot a normal life in that ending and Sean is not alone"

nutrition,ex20uzc,t3_cr5nxt,1565960433.0,"The problem is first that most cured meats have great amounts of salt in them, which can cause a long term blood pressure increase, kidney malfunctioning and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

The second problem is nitrates used to stave off decay, these substances are converted into N-nitrosamines which are confirmed carcinogens.

Also although we are made of meat not everything we need is in meat or in the right proportions, you couldn't survive on a sausage only diet for long because of the high fat content, lack of fibers and carbs and lack of many vitamins and essential aminoacids"

Is it working? Idk but at least I have a few hours a week when I do something I enjoy and it gives me some kind of sense of purpose, something I haven't ever gotten from uni.

CasualConversation,ew7yauc,t1_ew7w1go,1565199636.0,"This holistic view sounds kinda amazing, I'd give anything to actually believe something like this, but I have one question, in your worldview what place does the infinity of space and time have? I mean if humans are at the core of creation what's the point of everything else? What's the meaning of a universe that will outlast us by hundreds of trillion of years, why is space so immense? Like why are there as many galaxies as grains of sand on a beach each containing just as many stars?

CasualConversation,ew7qlix,t1_ew7pb26,1565195763.0,"Still in uni, on the contrary I have so much on my plate it's sometimes overwhelming, the thing is I don't even know why I do what I do.

I mean the economy is fucked, the planet has been fucked by baby boomers and there's no solution in sight, politics has become a worldwide shitshow and our lives are in the grasp of multi billion dollars megacorps.
 
I could go on but the reasons to be unhappy are neverending, but I'm just a sad person regardless of external stimuli, overthinking, unnecessary drama and sad literature and art are my life's infrastructure so maybe that's the problem. 

The thing with my generation is we were dealt shit cards but at least I'm convinced there's nothing behind the veil so no reason to be upset about it, fortunately I'll stop existing sooner or later"

Yes it is in human nature to stick with those who are most similar to you, it was you tho who said that I should just refer to white Americans, I think American culture is much more widespread among different ethnicities tho.

Also thank you for the social studies lesson but what I intended with cultural segregation wasn't to be taken as literal but i was talking about how different cultures tend to be often marginalized in American society but that they all share a more or less deeply felt belonging to a set of American values and ideas.

No my country is doing a shitty job at that but not even as apocalyptically bad as America"

I started exercising regularly 3 months ago and like yeah the results are starting to show but I got 3 kilos heavier, and I hadn't gained weight since 2013 so it bothered me to no end, now I'm 'shedding fat' which means I'm shifting from anorexic to orthorexic I guess (getting the right amounts of nutrients from the right sources and shit like that), I still eat more than before but I eat way less than the average human, also I moved from obsessively calorie counting to obsessively calorie burning.  

Basically everything changed and nothing did."
