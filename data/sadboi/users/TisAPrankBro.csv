I'm a part of this sub to support trans rights. That doesn't mean I have to agree with everything. This herd mentality is why the LGBT community will never be where we want it to be.

So IMO for being a great teacher for an affordable price Rocksmith wins my vote for the best guitar themed game. The only other thing I disagree with in this list is the placement of The Beatles Rock Band. That game is miles better than the other band themed games in this catalogue.

I've completely lost all will to continue playing because what Noah said in that tweet still holds true for players like myself. You actually have to make it your part time job to keep up. Especially if you play on PC. I know this will be downvoted to oblivion but I can't enjoy the game casually without having someone who edits for a living fight me every match.

It's now 2 years later and my sole passion in life is music. I listen to it as much as I can and it provides me the motivation to continue living.

mechanicalheadpens,fm8asjh,t1_fm89n0s,1585845975.0,I've tried all of the affordable switches on the market outside of blacks. I just know that I won't like the actuation force on them. I like a feathery switch. I genuinely love red switches but they too have too much resistance for me personally. I love the audible click of blue variants when typing but when gaming it's quite distracting. Browns are amazing but I just can't type as fast as I want with the tactility. So it seems like I'm a light linear switch kind of person.
mechanicalheadpens,fm8994r,t1_fm88oj6,1585845174.0,The Steelseries keyboard I'm referencing is very cheap. Plastic everything in terms of housing.

mechanicalheadpens,fm85jcg,t1_fm7n921,1585843205.0,Yeah but I traded it with a Black Widow. That's where the mistake was made.
