baseballcards,fqq36bb,t1_fqq2986,1589558608.0,Yeah I know that. It seems like the prospects that people aren’t hyped for do great in the majors but prospects that people are hyped for don’t really do that good.
baseballcards,fqpsgb1,t1_fqpsc2y,1589553126.0,Ok
baseballcards,fqpgbvn,t1_fqpd5bf,1589545673.0,I know that. I meant to say did you get those cards when Acuna was in the minors or majors? The cards probably had a lower value when he wasn’t in the majors yet.
baseballcards,fqodjgr,t1_fqod5cl,1589512827.0,I’ve been following baseball for a long time but started collecting cards in 2017. I didn’t really know what good cards were besides relics and autos. I started looking through my binders and I found lots of short prints and good rookies and prospect cards including the Acuna one.

Another reason is that this shipping is going too far. For Mario x Meggy, Mario is no doubt an adult. He’s been around since the 80s for gods sake! Now for Meggy, she’s probably a teenager. The Splatoon Wiki even says that inklings are 14-16 years old. Now you most likely heard this before, but that’s straight up pedophilia. And all of this hentai shit for shipping smg4 characters is making my eyes wanting to kill theirselves. Now for the people that ship smg4 characters, I can’t stop you but I’m not a fan of it."

Since I’m a hardcore baseball fan I play MLB the Show since it’s the only good baseball game out there (RBI baseball is trash, you shouldn’t get it). For Madden the graphics are great and the gameplay is good. Also the songs in Madden are way better than songs in MLB the Show 20. Also I think that if you wanna get it, you should know some things about football. Like what a snap is or what a pass is. In my opinion it’s like that for all sports games. Like if you wanna play FIFA you should know how soccer works and thats the same for every sports game. To conclude Madden is a good game and just as long as you know how football works and you enjoy football, it’s worth getting."
