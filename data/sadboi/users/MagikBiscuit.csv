I have had no medical training, I was taught in SCHOOL that that isn't true. And the male book is accurate? I don't understand this. How is this not a huge issue and also how has there not been thousands of lawsuits from this? It's the same as getting hand surgery to fix something, the doctor being trained by a book that says hands are meant to have 3 fingers and just lopping your fingers off cos they were in the way and then NOT being sued."

relationship_advice,fbtbonf,t3_ee5vc2,1577073790.0,"There is a difference like others have said between don't care about what you see as imperfections and someone who doesn't care about appearance. From what I've seen most people who say they don't care about appearance actually mean they do care about it, but it isn't very high up on their list at all. 

This might get downvoted cos it's easy to misunderstand but I'm speaking extremely generally and purely biologically. Men are kinda programmed to lust after women and their pheromones and have as much sex as possible, women are programmed to be more picky and choose a mate who will provide well and give them offspring likely to live long enough to sire their own offspring. 

It's why men are more visual than women in regards to arousal. And is why 99% of the time truly don't care how a labia/vagina or breasts look, our primal section of our mind, our hindbrain is just going ""oooh vagina"" not to mention women are bombarded more with the details about their body than men, don't get me wrong men are bombarded with body issues as well but with us it's more simple, you must be thin lots of muscles and big dick. For women it's far more subtle, like things must be symmetrical your hair must be lustrous your hips must have this very specific shape etc etc. All of these things are just to sell products. If we still lived in the area and time where large women were considered the peak of beauty and desirability all the ads would show large women and products would all be ways of being large without impacting your health and other stuff like that.

Of course you can't know what people are truly thinking. But it's going to be extremely uncommon for someone to not mean what they say when they say you're beautiful or they don't even notice whatever imperfections you're talking about."
normalnudes,fbtb24k,t1_fbt9v3l,1577073264.0,"Yeah sounds like you just in a habit of mentally criticising yourself. But yeah I mean, the rest of the dysphoria is more difficult to get over but you can definitely be assured there is never any reason to worry about your labia. I know people who party all the time and slept with so many people and still if they're sent a picture of a random vagina are practically drooling. It's ingrained into us. I mean, it's really unfair but it's ingrained lol. 

I can empathize with the dismorphia. I have a hell of a lot of it myself. Body and gender. It's why I started a NSFW account and posted fun nudes. Occasionally. To help myself with my body image a bit. It's really difficult if you're Male but it still helps, if you feel up to it I would recommend it, especially with you being female IF it's what you need you certainly get a lot of attention and praise about your body. 

Tbh it really does sound like he's repressing a lot of conflicting orientation issues. I'm sorry you ended up with him :("
normalnudes,fbt7uk3,t1_fbe5rax,1577070682.0,"I'm baffled why. Actually I'm baffled why anyone is insecure about their vagina. I mean guys literally lust over any of them, I've never ever heard of a guy seeing an ugly or unpleasant vagina (from like biological standpoint, not talking about cleanliness or anything) I mean dicks, sure, guys can be paranoid about size and shape and such even though they try to remember it means less than in a relationship but society keeps clinging onto it anyway I digress. I mean it's why there's like people on reddit with names like pm me your vagina and such, because guys couldn't care less what they look like, I think there's only 1 person on reddit who has a name saying pm me dicks, or another part of guys lol.   


Also that BF sucks. Tbh he might be gay, I'm not saying that because he didn't like looking at your pic, I mean like sometimes people with repressed tendencies will try to force themselves to like something and then when they finally get it they realize if THIS doesn't do anything then something ain't right. Or he could just be a manipulative shit trying to lower your self esteem."
