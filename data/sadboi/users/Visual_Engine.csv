I was born addicted to drugs, and was put in medical foster home almost immediately. I was adopted by psycho cult people who beat and tormented me everyday. They isolated me and played so many mind games so that I would be ashamed and punished. Basically they forced me to eat my own vomit and they’d blind fold me and made me sit outside naked on a stool. They’d search me when I came home from school . Their son molested me but did nothing and I got in trouble for telling. I wasn’t allowed to eat anything but cereal. My room had an alarm system with chicken wire so that if it went off I’d be like put into a cold shower, hit with a belt, made to scrub my mouth out. Every day was like this . I was always vulnerable. At 9 I was taken out and put into the foster care system again. My foster mom was alright.  She had a bunch of animals I got to play with and help take care of . I had all my needs taken care of . I joined sports and was able to do a lot of therapy. But I struggled socially because of what had happened. Then when I was 11 my foster dad started molesting me and he was put into jail when I was 12. I never felt safe around men. The extended family of the family who were extremely abusive we’re loving and supportive to me. But they also never did anything about their relatives (my adopted immediate family. ) I told them but they always brushed it to the side , even when they admitted  they Knew something wasn’t right. No one pursued justice for me. I went to courts and many DHS officials knew what had happened but no one said a word. They never saw their day in jail. Me and my foster sister were homeless for 6 months while our foster mom had to scramble to get a new home when our entire neighborhood flooded. Her health started to decline when I was 17. So I got adopted a second time at 17. They weren’t bad. They were ministers, we knew them. But it seemed like they put on a show. They fought at dinners almost every night. Their son was on drugs. They would make judge mental comments about everyone. They’d critique the way I did dishes even tho I never learned . They never cared. They took 500 out of my SSI each month, but expected me to go to college and have a job even tho I had several developmental disorders. I did it , somehow. As a junior in college, I was hit by a car . I was unconscious until the ambulance arrived . I broke my leg and got a TBI. Ever since then I struggle to go anywhere or do anything without panic attacks. I feel like I’m gonna pass out or dissolve. I sometimes feel like I’m having a stroke or a heart attack or something. I struggled like this but they somehow thought it would be a great idea to kick me out a month after being released from rehab. They expected me to do all my dishes, get myself to my appointments , pay all my bills, when my leg was broken . They were mad that I had started getting to know all my bio family and that i didn’t include them . I feel as though getting adopted was a huge mistake. A huge huge mistake. It felt like  religious ordeal. Like they wanted praise for it at their church, but it was conditional. Their attitude changed once they began to see me for me as I started to really open up and share my true thoughts and feeling and desires. I feel like I have been that foster kid that said and did whatever to get people to like me, so that I know I’d be safe and valued and cared for. I wanted everything to just be normal but it never was. I feel like it’s useless now, to put in hard work. I’m afraid the people who love me now, could leave . And I’m afraid . I loose my jobs because my performance decreases. I start of strong but can’t maintain because of anxiety . I am scared for my future, and I want to die before I loose everything. I want to go away and to the womb before all this happened. I can’t handle any more. I’m so broken. And telling everyone my life story , doesn’t work. The whole me too movement encouraged me to speak up and let it all out no matter who listened but it doesn’t help. I’m starting EDMR therapy. If it doesn’t work , I don’t know. It’s not like everything is a horror show. I’ve made very cool memories with my friends. I got to be part of a lot of amazing things - Disney land, going outta the country once, doing a former foster youth convention, summer camps, a lot that I probably didn’t deserve but I did cause I didn’t know if anything like it would ever come up again.  I qualified for a lot of financial aid being a former foster youth. I accomplished a lot. I made a magazine in college. But now I’m burnt out. I live in subsidized housing. I don’t know anymore . It feels like I’m only 25 but I’ve lived a century and I’m just done. I’m sad. Because of how people took advantage of me. It’s like they gave me the world, told me everything would be alright then went and spit in my face, and kicked me while I was down. I don’t want this anymore . I’m putting this out there because it may show why some people like me want nothing more than to milk themselves. I won’t . Because I don’t want a funeral to happen. I don’t want people to make a scene. I don’t want people to preach. I just don’t. It’s better to live out my days, dead inside. I don’t want people to gather in my name. And the people I do really care about, I don’t want them to feel bad more than they already do. I would never want them to suffer. In fact I want to spoil them so hard and love them so hard cause that seems to be the only reason for living, is being nice to others . But I swing back and forth from thinking life’s a joke and I’m incredible crazy and dysfunctional and useless to maybe one more day with my cousins. Maybe one more day doing this . But the times I wish to die and the anxiety that creeps up scares me. If I get to the point I’m punching myself and rolling on the ground at the transit station, I’m just worried i might do something stupid."
