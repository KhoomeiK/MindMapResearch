We were a town of about 17,000 and there were signs plastered everywhere with the killers info such as he drove a red van, was a bigger guy and had red hair. It even got to the point where they were so sure this guy was in our town the local police recommend no one outside alone (especially kids, like I was) and especially after dark have someone with you. There was a point that everyones individual parents had to pick them up and sign them out at my elementary school. A few weeks pass and the police do not locate this man and so things kind of calm down and people go back to normal life (everyone assumed it was a false alarm although there was multiple eye witness who saw him around). Anyways it was a saturday morning and as I did most weekends, I was walking down to the park to play with all the neighborhood buddies. Along comes rolling a red van going so slow past the park where my friends were playing that it sent me into panic mode. I inmediately stop walking and turn around nonchalantly, because I was hoping they didn‚Äôt notice and I was not sure if he saw me. I got around the corner and DARTED and told my dad who was doing yard work. He called it in and the police were scouring our neighborhood for the next few days and never came up with anything. To this day, although I never saw the driver, I think it was him; and if I wouldn‚Äôt have seen him lurking and had my dad call the cops he might have kidnapped my friends at the park.
