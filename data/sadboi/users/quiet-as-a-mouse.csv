Name: A
Age: 29 (turning 30 at the end of July)

Location: FL, US

Due date: 1/11/2021

First time parent: yes!

Gender guess: not sure...but every time I picture our baby, I picture a girl.

Feeling so far: exhausted, bloated, gassy, hungry."

If I‚Äôm not feeling it, I just tell him no, loudly, and push him away if he doesn‚Äôt wake up and realize what‚Äôs going on. Sometimes, it really works for me and we have incredible sex. If we go forward with it, I make sure he‚Äôs fully awake before we do it. Just be aware of when things like this tend to happen to mitigate anything awkward (or nonconsensual) from happening."

What you're feeling is valid. From what I understand, having an alcoholic beverage sporadically is okay. I have enjoyed NA craft beers from brands like Bravus, Athletic, and similar brands (I have a shipment coming from one I haven't tried yet, Gruvi!). 

It's also okay to seek help about this if you need it. Try discussing with a therapist or maybe look into an online zoom support meeting. Keep going, Mama, you're doing great!"
