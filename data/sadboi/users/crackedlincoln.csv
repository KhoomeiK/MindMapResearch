We all got together at this guy's house because they had a really spacious, cool house including a garage that was heated, had couches, and was essentially an extension of their house.

One night while hanging out there the host asked us all to head to the garage because he had something really cool he wanted to show us. We all went out there thinking he had gotten a new addition for his bike or some kind of new game that we'd all play. The host comes out to the garage, sets his beer down on top of a safe, opens the safe and pulls out a handgun. This is the same guy that had been shotgunning beers and knocking back shot after shot earlier in the night. He was absolutely smashed and had no business handling a firearm. He proceeded to point it at us and when I freaked out, telling my husband we needed to leave immediately, the host told me to ""chill out and enjoy the excitement"" and that it didn't ""count"" that the gun was pointed at my face because it ""wasn't loaded anyway."" My husband laid into the guy, he put the gun away, we left and never really hung around that group again."

One story that gives me chills: The last day of 8th grade a lot of us brought cameras to school to take pictures of each other to have as a lasting memory of our middle school days. We were told we were allowed to have them as long as we were only using them between classes and at lunch. I had my camera out at lunch and was taking photos of different groups of friends when the assistant principal came up and took my camera, telling me I wasn't allowed to have it out during ""eating time"".

When I was 2 my dad cut off all contact with his parents, but left the option open for me and my brother to have a relationship with them if we wanted once we were a bit older. After hearing what awful people they were for my dad's entire life, I chose to never contact them and to never have a relationship with them. I'm currently 27 and have never met them, although (to our knowledge) they are both still alive.

I chose to not have a relationship with them both out of support for my father, but also because they aren't the kind of people I want to spend time with. Abusive, racist, homophobic, manipulative people are exactly the kind of people we all tend to strive to avoid and not have relationships with, bloodline shouldn't change that. Terrible people are terrible people, regardless of relation, just try to keep that in mind as you move forward.

relationship_advice,fbxtx0b,t3_eezl0h,1577200407.0,"> I have been thinking lately that I can only ask him for so much, and basic ‘boyfriend behaviour’ such as buying small gifts, surprises and just being considerate and thoughtful and showing that you care isn’t really something that you can just ask someone to do.

You can ask him for more though. He may not even realize that you're feeling badly or that he's not fulfilling all your hopes and needs. Communication is key and it's okay to talk about the things you need and want in a relationship. Different people show love in different ways and he may be unaware that he's not showing you love in a way that works for you.

I know you're both young and a LDR is hard no matter what, but this advice applies to any of your future relationships as well. Don't be afraid to tell people what you want, need, and expect from them. It doesn't have to be done in a demanding or belittling manner, but it should be done."

2) After my first date with him another girl that was into him stormed up to me at work and said ""Why are you going on dates with my boyfriend?"" At this point I thought he was a straight up player that was dating all the girls at work.

Turns out, he was completely clueless that any of these girls liked him (including me) and had never dated anyone in the past.

Overall it sounds like the two of you have very different expectations for your marriage and for each other.

Address this idea in calm manner and try to approach it from a place of concern, love, and worry to avoid getting a defensive response from her.

relationship_advice,f850u9a,t1_f84vpng,1574265161.0,"I agree with this. I used to think I wanted children. I'd babysit for friends and family and absolutely loved it and felt like I was made for motherhood. Then, I lived with my niece for the first 2 years of her life. Even though she wasn't my baby, being around a child *all the time* really changed my perspective on parenthood and how much it changes every aspect of you life. Babysitting and actually having children full time are **very** different things.

I would also highly recommend therapy. Long-term therapy. Resentment is a hard thing to work through, but it needs to be worked through for any hope of a healthy relationship between the two of you and between him and the kids."
Marriage,f84ytn2,t1_f84vo0f,1574263884.0,"I agree. Point out the many lies you've caught him in. Address it from a place of concern, not blame to avoid him getting defensive and going off. Let him know that you care and are worried, but if this behavior continues you may have to start considering an alternative lifestyle for all of you."
Marriage,f84si66,t3_dz0y7i,1574259609.0,Always freezing wife here. We keep the thermostat at 67 in the winter. My husband got me the golden gift a couple years ago for Christmas - a heated blanket. I highly recommend a heated blanket to anyone that's frequently cold.
Anxiety,f84rspg,t1_f81uj3u,1574259072.0,"We started going because there were certain issues in our relationship that have existed since the beginning that we just could not seem to get over or tackle on our own. We realized how much of a toll these issues were taking on our relationship and on our individual mental health. We would have these huge fights about once a month about the same problems. We realized that if we didn't get some help then we were bound to struggle and fight about these same things for the rest of our lives or our marriage was bound to end over them.

We're still going to therapy weekly (we've been going for about 4 months now), but we've already been given so many helpful tools and skills to communicate better. We have stronger communication with each other and with other people in our lives. We've learned skills to help with boundary setting and managing expectations, which is something we had almost no skills in before.

Finding the right therapist is crucial and may take a while. Also, I highly suggest committing to whatever ""homework"" you're given and doing a little debriefing of the session afterwards. It's not easy and there's a chance that it will stir up some things that are difficult to deal with, but it's all a necessary part of the process.

I wish nothing but the best for you and your marriage and hope your journey through counseling is a positive one."

If it helps at all, couples therapy has been a great resource for me and my husband and has definitely helped get our marriage on a track we're both much happier with."

This made me laugh. But more out of sympathy because I feel very similarly about my husband's collections upon collections of stuff."
Marriage,f7yclmo,t3_dxldwu,1574092128.0,"Marriage has been incredibly liberating for me personally. In the beginning it wasn't so much, but that was more my own fault than his. Once I realized the intense love he had for me and the loyalty that existed between us, I realized I had finally found a person who made me feel safe, worthy, and brave. I've grown a lot because of him and his constant support. I've made all sorts of mistakes and had a lot of terrible moments that he's witnessed, but the fact that his love has never wavered makes me feel stronger and more liberated than I did before. It's just a nice, secure feeling knowing someone always has your back and is always willing to go up to bat for you, defend you, and cheer you on."

partyplanning,f7eqmlh,t3_dvtohq,1573663664.0,"I'd advise having some kind of activities/schedule of events in mind. Otherwise, you might find yourself in an awkward situation where people are standing around expectantly, not sure what they should be doing.  Party games are always fun (maybe search around online and see if any sound like a good fit) and board games can be a great ice breaker. If you go with a Friends or The Office theme it might be fun to have everyone sit down with drinks & snacks to watch your partner's favorite episode. Having a general idea of how you envision the night going step by step will help things flow more smoothly and keep the party organized with a direction so people aren't left feeling uncomfortable."
AskReddit,f7emj3m,t1_f7d8htw,1573661049.0,"For the last few weeks the lock on the door to my house has been sticking, making it really difficult to unlock the door. I would literally have to set down anything I was carrying, lift the door up a little, and jiggle my key around in the lock for close to a minute to get the door to unlock. Every time I was out there doing that I was so afraid someone was going to call the cops because I had to look like I was picking the lock to my own house.

Luckily, my husband was able to fix it last night so my worries of being accused of B&E have been lifted."

AskWomen,f784lw7,t3_dulh7l,1573485094.0,"I'm married now, but my husband and I dated for almost 8 years before getting married. The reason we waited so long was basically just because we were young. I was 16 when we started dating and we wanted to make sure all other aspects of our lives were secure before getting married. We were focused on graduating college, getting steady jobs, and buying a house before getting married. Sometimes I wish we hadn't waited so long, but it was really nice to feel like my life was in a secure place and our relationship was solid before diving into marriage."
relationship_advice,f745k9q,t1_f72si82,1573398506.0,"I grew up with a similar situation. My mom favored my brother by far and my dad was never really present (he was around, but worked a lot and was never involved when he was home). Same boat with having a lot of emotional trauma and therapy and difficulty moving forward in life.

OP, you need to work through this with your husband. Sounds like your son has already noticed and that will only continue to deteriorate his self esteem and self image. I like the suggestion of framing it as an issue you and your husband can work through together rather than making it an attack against your husband specifically. I know it's hard to stand up to someone who doesn't like to be stood up against, but in this case I think it's crucial you go up to bat for your son and his mental health."
