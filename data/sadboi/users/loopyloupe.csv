Your other foster obviously has a lot more shared experience and potentially shared values with you and the way you are treating Clara is so exclusionary. It’s really upsetting especially when I imagine you have felt marginalised before due to your sexuality. “But my sexuality doesn’t hurt anyone.” And as far as you know neither does Clara’s expression of faith...you just haven’t made the effort to find out more."

serialkillers,fl24cco,t1_fl23r5o,1584742647.0,"Definitely agree that personality disorders have varying levels of success with treatment. I just know a bit about BPD since it’s one of the labels I’ve had and then had discarded by later psychiatrists. On the wait list to do DBT myself actually even though a new psychiatrist has a new opinion. And I’ve have friends with Bipolar II have a lot of success with it too so it’s broadly useful as a form of therapy. A lot about distress tolerance, emotional regulation and managing risks.

I haven’t heard about Dr. James Fallon but I can’t say I’m unsurprised that this was the outcome. Almost like the therapy taught him that the consequences for aggressive behaviour would hurt number 1 more than he was comfortable with so instead he was just (still bad) emotionally distant and selfish. I’ll have to look him up."
serialkillers,fl1zmxb,t1_fl1pj1u,1584739682.0,"I would categorise personality disorders under mental illness insofar as they can be treated in one manner or another. E.g. DBT for BPD which is known to be quite effective. The same can be said for medication, you can medicate for some of the symptoms of various mood disorders I.e. intense mood swings. I think it’s a little unsafe, even discriminatory, to separate them out when they are very much linked with other mental illnesses.

With medication and the correct therapy perhaps Dahmer would not have been such a threat to society as he became however this is, of course, just a hypothesis. Or perhaps, a la Kemper, he would game the system...We can’t know for sure but it sure is fun to hypothesise about."
serialkillers,fl1kz08,t3_flya1g,1584731064.0,"I don’t know if I agree on your potential diagnoses for him. BPD doesn’t, to my mind, fit Dahmer. And while he hits some of the symptom buttons for schizophrenia I don’t think he’s necessarily hitting enough buttons for it to be that over psychopathy. I speak from personal experience with BPD and am very hesitant to play the BPD sufferers are manipulative card. I think he probably exhibits symptoms of both of the disorders you mentioned but that this is true of many illnesses and disorders categorised in the DSM. There’s a lot of overlap and it requires in person treatment for adequate diagnoses to be made. Even then different professionals will have different opinions. This too is from my personal experience with psychiatrists.

Was he mentally ill? In some manner, I believe so. As such he did deserve treatment. Did he commit horrendous crimes that needed to be dealt with via the justice system? Also yes. I do not believe the two are mutually exclusive."
