depression,fkkkxb2,t3_fiojbi,1584286360.0,"Thats because depression is a medical condition. It's not just ""the Blues"" or feeling a bit down. It is a chemical imbalance in the brain related to serotonin. You should see your doctor as there are a wide variety of ""serotonin uptake inhibitors"" that address the problem. I have been on these for years and they literally saved my life. If the problem is also related to trauma you've experienced then you may also benefit from counselling. There are great online services that are less $ than traditional counselling (video chat based etc) and are more flexible. No matter what, don't give up, try to do one small thing for yourself every day, and -- really really important but sometimes really really hard--try to get a little exercise even if it is a 10 or 15 min walk. It generates ++ endorphins and fresh air just feels nice in the lungs. I wish the best for you and your recovery. Things DO get better but you need to take back control from the Bastard Black Dog of depression. You're worth it, I promise. Love and peace."
