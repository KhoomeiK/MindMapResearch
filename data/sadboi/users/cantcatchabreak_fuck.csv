datingoverthirty,fc723fu,t1_fc5lp4i,1577495489.0,">any time a woman is assertive and takes the initiative I find it incredibly attractive and a huge turn on. Says something about her confident nature and also her willingness to be vulnerable enough to possibly be rejected. Both very mature things.

I am someone who is okay with and have taken the first steps as I am a bold person. It is nice to know that there are men who view bold women like that. But I feel like that was mostly not the case for me. I always get this feeling that I made them uncomfortable or that I humiliated myself although I have never done something extreme like just showing a guy that I am interested in them.

I just feel that guys like you are in the minority, the exception."

relationships,f9nezlh,t3_e629e3,1575483154.0,">I appreciate that people may think down on me

No no, no one would ever think down on you. Being depressed is not something to be ashamed of. You are just simply struggling. 

>Do I break up with her? Do I stay with her despite multiple recent attempts on my life? I love her but I just donâ€™t know.

Yes if you feel she is making your mental health worse. She may be not able to handle or know how to deal with a depressed person due to her age which is understandable. I would suggest you to seek a mental health counselor and not rely on ur gf since she obv cannot help you.

Get well soon."
datingoverthirty,f9j7zub,t3_e558hw,1575360290.0,">Been talking over whatsapp using the texting and voice notes feature, she started sending the voice notes right away so I went along.

Nothing wrong with that. Some ppl are just not big on texting and prefer sending voice notes.

>One the first day she asked for pics, not nudes but normal ones, after that she's been sending her pics without even me asking, normal selfies and stuff. Not nudes or anything inappropriate.

Very normal. Like it is very common for ppl to ask for Pic to get to know how their potential date looks like. 

>Keeps harping on the point that she's been a ""virgin"" for the past 9 yrs after her last serious bf, said there was beating involved(whaaaat??!) and after that she's never had sex and is waiting ""for the ONE"", she keeps bringing up this not having had sex and the one thing A LOT, even in response to silly comments and jokes around sex, I just find it so strange like she's obsessed with virginity or is clearly guilty and hiding something..?

I wouldn't be quick to judge. She might have been going out with dudes whom no matter how much she tell that she is only into having sex in a very serious relationship, they still try to hook up with her. So she doesn't want to meet you or start anything if you will end up the same.

>Big into ""positive thinking"", keeps giving me the ""accept me"" and ""do not judge me"" ALL THE TIME, even for silly comments I make where a normal person would just reply with a joke or even silly comeback!

I am someone who tend not to get jokes via texting if I don't know that person well. The accept me or don't judge me thing maybe she has gone through a very bad experience or something.

>Says things like she's missing me and tries to get me to say it, does the cute voice mimicking thing, I think which only couples should do, asks me for selfies because she wants to see me..!

That's a major turn off if you guys haven't even met. 

>Does the whole ""don't talk to me"" and starts ranting random things when I try to remind her we're not really a couple and should take this slow and at least MEET FIRST!!

That's not normal. I'd be really concerned."
