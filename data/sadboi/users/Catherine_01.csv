But Iâ€™m just trying to roll with the punches and whatever happened happened.  I need to move on and do much better as a whole"
IBO,fnp7972,t1_fnp6nri,1587140447.0,"Actually this happened a couple of months ago, and I have yet to finish my year. Since the IB exams are cancelled. I am just going to be receiving certificates and whatever grade I get In the end, but that IA that was for a specific class will be a zero for that class from what Iâ€™ve been told. So Iâ€™m just hoping and praying that I get my diploma. I luckily have still been accepted to a Uni. So all Iâ€™m saying is that I advise no one to do what I did. Iâ€™m still figuring out some back up plans if I donâ€™t get my diploma. So please donâ€™t copy or else u will regret it."
IBO,fnova3a,t3_g30l2p,1587134266.0,"Look take it from me, donâ€™t let her do that. I did something similar and I got excused from IB. If it is the final draft as well she will be paying for the consequences, better just do the work. I wish I did this cause then I would have graduated with the IB diploma. Tell her itâ€™s better to confront the teacher now cause if not they will find out and would fail on her own ethical decisions."
SuicideWatch,fne2mpu,t3_g0dgke,1586881970.0,"This really relates to me to be honestly. And I hate to say that I often feel this way too. Iâ€™ve been doing horribly in school and am so scared that I wonâ€™t get my diploma. I wouldnâ€™t know what to do if I didnt and I believe my dad told me once during an argument that he would kick me out since Iâ€™ll be 18 soon. I really donâ€™t know about my life anymore, I always feel like Iâ€™m screwing up more and more, wasting my parents money and disappointing them. I just am so done with getting yelled at and am done with disappointing them and know that I embarrass them. I just canâ€™t anymore and I want to end it all."

IBO,fktobht,t1_fkto6yh,1584528790.0,"No it was not in relations to my predicted grade. Iâ€™ve actually emailed my unis, and one that Iâ€™ve been conditionally accepted to asked what IB certificates would I get and my school would need to show proof that Iâ€™ll be getting a HS diploma. Does this seem like they are still considering me??"
IBO,fkor6wo,t1_fkoqqjr,1584393311.0,"It is tbh, but what sucks the most is that I had 2 months left of it and I would have graduated."
IBO,fkoq68r,t1_fkop8o5,1584392685.0,"Yeah Iâ€™m fine with discussing the reasons on why I plagiarized. During the week that I was to submit this work I was going through a lot of stress with mocks being in a couple of days, I canâ€™t make this a full excuse for my actions as Iâ€™m not the only one who goes through stress in the IB. However personally for myself, I couldnâ€™t handle it, I had deadlines after deadlines and studying needing to be done with so little time as well as personal issues at home. I sadly gave in to the temptations of plagiarizing. The other issue with this is that not only did I plagiarized On the IA which wasnâ€™t discovered till recently but also on a formative draft in the same week of January. I got called in to the principles office and was spoken to about the issue which they took into consideration of my well being (yet this was only on the matter of the formative draft as they didnâ€™t have knowledge of the IA at that time). I realized now if I came clean during that time as I was having the meeting the outcome may have been different. 

Also I have already scheduled a meeting with my school counselor for tomorrow to discuss the matter and what I should be doing now."
IBO,fkop0w8,t1_fkoos7n,1584391921.0,"The severity of the plagiarism was quite high and it wasnâ€™t taken from other sources but rather another students paper since we were doing a group experiment. If Iâ€™m completely honest, this plagiarism was intentional. I had full knowledge of it, and didnâ€™t come to my senses to report this back in January when I submitted it."
