He gives everyone second and 3rd chances. If you have enough to wait until you are clean are you able to reschedule without getting into trouble? I can't imagine all doctors are like this.

From an addict's perspective the last thing he wants to do is hurt you. I guarantee when he goes to bed at night he has the best of intentions of not using the next day.  He is in constant agony wanting to be clean but wanting to be high more.

Yes, by doing what is best for you I believe you are doing the right thing."

As far as drinking goes that is another story.  Be sort of mellow with the drinking so you don't embarrass yourself by getting too fucked up and chatty Kathy or repeat mode. That has happened to me a few times when I drink with it. A couple of cocktails should be perfect."

I am still trying to forgive myself for wasting all those years and making it worse for myself.  The diagnosis was tough to stomach but now I joke about it with my spouse and other family and friends.  For whatever reason that helps.
