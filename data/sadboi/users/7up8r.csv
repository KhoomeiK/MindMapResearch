As well, while it's not free, upgrading your HDD to 10TB or so will go a long way with having fewer headaches.

So, you'll want to make sure that every client is able to Direct Play or Stream each file. 

1. Take pictures and make a guide to go to Settings > Quality > Change Stream to Maximum. 
2. Get only 720p files, as they tend to require less bandwidth to stream, as long as their file size is up to 2GB. 
3. Ask them to get Plex Media Player on PC.
4. If on a mobile device, ask them to sync movies, this way they can watch them anywhere they want without relying on your bandwidth.

And to really answer your question, depending on what your setup looks like, certain software, like Radarr will allow you to set file size and quality that you want to get. So it will not download large files in the first place, or if it does, it will download the smaller file size when it is available instead.

Got to remember that it’s still just a car and I’m 10 years you’ll probably get a new one anyway at which point you can just repaint the car if you really want."
