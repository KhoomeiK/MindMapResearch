AskReddit,fposc1i,t1_fpo92a1,1588789819.0,Are there any documentaries on Luxottica? I only seem to see (with my over priced glasses) articles. YouTube maybe a better place to look but I feel Netflix should have jumped on this.
modernwarfare,fpkaxcb,t1_fpjerwl,1588691333.0,"Yeah I should edit my post. I didn‚Äôt even think of games like PUBG, Fortnite, Gears, Ghost Recon and Red Dead Redemption. 

I would say that‚Äôs why I think SOCOM stuck out to me (funny cause it‚Äôs on the PlayStation) the fact that it was realistic and militaristic like call of duty. I‚Äôm not too sure about the aim assist on those games that‚Äôs why I said in another post that they pretty much set the bar for third person shooters at least for me."
modernwarfare,fpkabxg,t1_fpjak03,1588691011.0,Yeah Gears has always been big and it is really fun. I plan on playing through the series in order someday. Just like I did Halo with the MCC.
modernwarfare,fpka6dw,t1_fpiw40b,1588690928.0,Everyday dude... I feel ya
modernwarfare,fpka3xt,t1_fpj0i01,1588690891.0,"Right, we‚Äôre talking militaristic and realistic. I never thought tortnight would take off the way it did."

modernwarfare,fphu18q,t1_fphtjur,1588627796.0,Yeah I played that one for a bit. I also played some breakpoint too. The only downside is the micro transactions and the live service aspect other than that I really like ghost recon games. I would say those would be the closest to call of duty third person.
modernwarfare,fphtqiw,t1_fphszpo,1588627641.0,I‚Äôve seen some footage from Vigor and thought it looked pretty good. PUBG was something I liked playing but something was off about it for me. I haven‚Äôt heard of Cuisine Royale before.

modernwarfare,fphk124,t1_fphiuf3,1588622639.0,Yeah I‚Äôm talking militaristic. I almost said mature but there are some clan tags and such that would prove otherwise.
modernwarfare,fphh7bh,t1_fphftsv,1588621221.0,The only thing that came to mind was SOCOM. But that was ages ago. No doubt they set the bar.

modernwarfare,fphbvec,t3_gdgl82,1588618512.0,If this is implemented I would be so stoked. There aren‚Äôt any big third person shooters out out now. Seeing it from come out of IW would be somewhat strange but good for them to have the third person market cornered albeit small.
Seahawks,fph8a4i,t1_fph5iyi,1588616721.0,Yeah I would say his question would work.

Seahawks,fph81f8,t1_fph2yay,1588616598.0,Well I‚Äôm glad to hear that it brings back all the motions back. I‚Äôll just cherry pick the good ones.
Seahawks,fph2n5b,t3_gdelyc,1588613879.0,So you‚Äôre saying we win games by halftime given we‚Äôre up by 4 points?! Who says games are won in the 4th quarter?
Seahawks,fph2h8a,t1_fpgvheg,1588613797.0,I have been considering re-watching some games. Is it any fun? Any recommendations?

I understand that there is a middle ground that has to be met: the ratio of money lost to human lives is a difficult but necessary way of looking at this. It‚Äôs not like any of those three remedies are coming next month.
