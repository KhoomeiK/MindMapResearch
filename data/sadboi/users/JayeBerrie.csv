AsOneAfterInfidelity,fqhbndo,t3_git95w,1589373389.0,"I could tell my WS was sorry after DDay almost exactly a year ago. 

I watched him end things with his AP over whatsapp, he sat with me all the next day while I cried and cried. He answered all my questions, was very patient, and he cried too actually saying it broke his heart seeing me like this and he would never make me feel like this again. He then jumped into being a more affectionate and doting partner.

And then almost exactly a year later he cheated again, and with the same person. 

It’s not worth the effort. If you’re gone and surviving just cut your losses and move on."

sex,fpg6g9i,t3_gd6xei,1588595573.0,"I have the same problem. It’s less of an issue when your partner is more endowed so there’s always that to consider, but here’s my tips and tricks. 

1. Less foreplay

It doesn’t have to be everytime but I find if my partner gets me too excited before he penetrates, I can be too wet. But as a nice for him switch up sometimes try less or no foreplay as it gives him a little more time to finish

2. Wiping or cream

During foreplay wipe yourself to get rid of some of the moisture. I also occasionally use a cream I found at a local sex shop that is meant to help girls with this issue. You just insert I think 5-10 mins before and it really helps dry things up - but I wouldn’t use it too too much, just a nice treat. 

3. Kegels

Even when it’s super wet down there during sex, he will be able to feel you squeeze. Whenever I felt it getting too wet with my ex I would just squeeze as hard as I could to create some friction and then when it felt like he was cumming I would pulse it. It takes a lot of control down there but it’s worth it. 

4. Different positions

Missionary sucks when things feel too wet and even doggy can be iffy but something like reverse cowgirl can be effective since in that position the penis pushes against the back of your vagina while thrusting. Again it just creates more friction. 

5. Anal

Not sure if you like it but when you are like dripping wet, it’s the perfect time for anal. If it’s that wet his dick is already really lubed up and so is the area around your ass and if you relax he can usually slip it in the ass with no pain and finish there."
FallOutBoy,fo1fadt,t1_fo160ti,1587432033.0,I was so sure after “biggest mistake” the line was:  “happy Alice Hefburn keeps ‘em better everyday” and sang it like that for years before realizing that makes no sense hahah
stepparents,fndftv3,t3_g0rkpd,1586868973.0,"This sounds a lot like the start of my relationship so I’m gonna give you some backstory, how it panned out, and then my advice! 

So when I started seeing my SO, his SD was a young teenager. SO had a really good relationship with BM (which he explained to me as being due to the fact that they co-parented for years and split custody of the kid without courts or custody agreements. I thought that seemed fair - of course I later came to know that BM originally blocked him from seeing SD very often and that by catering to her every whim and being a pushover, SO “proved himself” in a way and earned the time with his daughter. So yeah a bit messed up). 

So back then SD was here for a week and at her moms for a week. When SD was at her moms, BM would call my SO almost nightly and text throughout the day. SO said it was about SD and this is what he had to do to keep things peaceful, but like you, I felt icky about it. As time went on SO would do things like put her on speaker when she called or let me see her texts. There were... a lot of crossed lines. It all came to a head when BM called drunk one night and asked my SO if “his little friend was here or if they could be alone”. I was shocked. She went on to tell him that she was having dreams about him and I just kinda lost it. From there SO and I had chats about boundaries and how it’s not fair for him to keep up this kind of relationship (even with his child’s mother) if he was serious about a relationship with me. 

So time went on and things got better, but whenever BM gets lonely or her BF cheats on her again, she’s back trying to get attention from my SO. Finally she started texting him about “remember this house where we first started dating and omg I miss you so much” followed by another drunk call about how I am keeping them apart and SO put his foot down and said to BM that he will only talk to her about issues with SD and nothing more. I thought this would be good but it hasn’t been. SD is now an older teenager so BM does things like give her alcohol (she’s not that old yet) and then complains about me and SO to the point where SD is texting her father complaining about me and saying that she needs her father to be bffs with her mother or she is miserable (which is really just ridiculous and manipulative on the part of both girls). We’ve been through about 3 cycles so far of SD getting upset because of this, insisting on staying with her mom only, fighting with her mom and wanting to come back here; and then eventually getting over it and rinse, wash, repeat. 

SO HERE IS MY ADVICE TO YOU:

There are a lot of variables and a lot of components here. Families are very volatile and very delicate. 

So first you need to figure out if their relationship is crossing boundaries or if you are uncomfortable with your bf being close to his ex. It’s a very important distinction. At the start I thought I was just being insecure so I pushed all my ick feelings down even though BM was trying to have an emotionally dependent relationship with my SO. I put in a lot of effort talking with this woman, going to their family gatherings and being nice to her extended family, and being a part of their circus because I thought I was just insecure about their relationship. But that is not necessarily the case. So if you are not prepared to do all that, don’t go any further. Because if everything is actually innocent between BM and your bf then for all you know you would get invited to the family outings in the future. It’s not always malicious with BMs but you have to figure out their intent and relationship first. 

The kids. 
Do you know their ages? As with my story age is an important factor. If the kids are in their teens and you get in the middle of what they consider their family, you will not have a good time. If your bf stops doing “family” things with the kids and BM and they find out about you then there’s a high chance of resentment and potentially meddling. If BM is a good person she will guide the kids around that issue and shield them from these kinds of adult issues. If she’s not, she will use the kids as a weapon the way BM does in my relationship. So just more things for you to consider. 

More than likely, this will not be easy. You can love your boyfriend as much as you want to but that doesn’t change the fact that outside factors play a part and can be very hard on any relationship. You are at a point where you can leave without hurting anyone (except yourself and bf obv lol) but once you get into these kids lives and into BMs life you have to be hyper mindful of your actions and their reactions, even if no one else is held to the same standard. It is very hard sometimes to be Dads new GF. 

So I advise you have a full on conversation with Bf, and not one where he just acts like a pushover and says “you’re right I’ll stop doing xxx”. You need to ask the questions about BM, tell him you’re worried that she is using him to fill an emotional void, talk about your concerns and your boundaries and see if you guys can fall somewhere in the middle. 

Honestly, I know life doesn’t work like this, but if I knew how things would turn out back when I started dating my SO, I would probably have asked him to wait for me for a few years, let SD grow up and out of the reaches of her manipulative mother before coming into their lives. My SO has never had a successful relationship, in part due to his boundary issues with BM and being a pushover when it comes to her and SD. I took the time to work with SO and create healthy boundaries and our relationship is as strong as ever. We are finally getting good at weathering the storm that is BM. But it is not lost on me that I have made life harder for SD. She doesn’t care that her father is finally happy, she wants her mom to be happy and her mom wants to have my SO wrapped around her pinky in case of emergencies, like she’s always had. Because she is a terrible mother who uses her only daughter as a pawn, her daughter is the one who suffers. I have tried many times to take SD under my wing and teach her right from wrong, but she prefers to try and cause problems in my relationship in hopes that it will fix things for her mom and her mom can have her cake and eat it too. She was already too old when I came into the picture. She is her mother’s daughter and has no interest in growing as a person. 

It’s easy to get wrapped up in the right now but unfortunately this is a long situation no matter how you slice it. So really think it through and know as much as you can before you make any decisions. 

Good luck!!"

ottawa,fm0qjc1,t3_fsde2j,1585664152.0,"So Minto is giving 3 options here:
1. Pay half rent for April and they split the balance across May and June 
2. Pay half rent for April and May and pay the balance split over June to November
3. Pay half rent for April, May, and June and pay the balance across 9 months from July to next March. 

All they ask is that you provide reasoning for why you can’t pay rent (and something to back that up - like a letter from your employer about a lay off or reduced hours at work) and that you actually talk to your property management team instead of ignoring them and withholding rent. 

Seems pretty fair to me."

StopSelfHarm,fkwykt5,t3_fkxlde,1584611609.0,"When I was in middle school I used to take a blunt object and hit myself in the wrist with it until it started to bruise. I used to do it on both wrists. Something about the swelling and the bruising helped me calm down. Just like you, I never really thought too much of it or understood the gravity of it. I did end up escalating to cutting so I all but forgot about my weird bruising habit. 

Now, 15ish years later, I have really weak wrists with brittle bones. Years of working in cafes and office work have given me carpal tunnel in both wrists. Turns out it’s due to the bruising thing. And there’s nothing I can do to fix it. 

So I’m just saying, even if it doesn’t feel like self harm, it can fuck up the rest of your life."

I made a post the other day about my cats because they really change things. I got my first cat because I couldn’t handle the nights where my boyfriend wasn’t staying over. He’s since died but my cats now are just as special. 

Sometimes I’m crying and suddenly there is a purring cat on my chest breathing into my face. Eventually it calms me down, without fail, everyday. They force me to get out of bed at least twice a day (they need food!) and the little taking care of them tasks can give me purpose (cleaning their water fountain, changing the litter, playing with toys, etc). But it is a very long commitment. They are with us for a short lifetime."

ottawa,fcx5klj,t1_fcwike2,1578052160.0,I would actually suggest you first pick a location where it would be fun for your mom to walk and play and then contact local restaurants in that area and see if they serve French onion soup! A lot of places do but it’s as the “Soup of the Day” which is a fickle concept so they don’t necessarily serve it say every Wednesday and as such it wouldn’t be reflected on the menu.

I have apartments that are under 1,000 sq ft that are getting closer to $2,000 a month - and that’s just in the residential west end! No where near transit hubs or downtown. 

With the amount you’re willing to spend you can pretty much only rent privately (I.e someone renting out a renovated basement or part of a duplex. Not so much with the high-rise, condo-style rentals are at your price point). 

Your best bet is to check Kijiji’s rentals if you want an idea of what the costs are like for private landlords and what parts of the city are more cost effective. You should also consider living outside of the city or in Hull if you can because it really pulls the price down if you don’t mind a commute.

BPD,f4xxugk,t3_dm5en1,1571870085.0,"I was the same as you. Never spoke to a single ex after any break up unless it was a booty call. Until my most recent ex.

I think it had to do with the terms of our breakup (grew apart and we were both unhappy. I never would have ended things but I did recognize eventually that we did need to break up) and the dependency I had/have with him. We’ve been broken up for, shit, I think 3 years now? And I have a new boyfriend and we don’t necessarily even talk regularly but he still knows me better than anyone, always knows what I need to hear, and when I’m in a panic is ultimately the person I need to go to. 

Generally I agree with you and I don’t understand how people talk to their exes or stay friends but for some reason I have that with him. It’s weird.

I’m definitely not friends or even on speaking terms with anyone I’ve known platonically for over 2 years at this point other than family either so I really don’t get it haha"
