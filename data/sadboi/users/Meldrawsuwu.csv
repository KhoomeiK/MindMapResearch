He lives with his parents. Yeah.. quarentine does fucking suck. Even if you had a partner and didn't live together it would be the same as a long distance relationship tbh.

From my side:
 I personally have high functioning autism and ever since I got diagnosed my sister and I had problems. I got diagnosed late at 13. Around that time my pills were fucked up and every time I did something brutal or horrible my parents would excuse it with it's just my autism. Or like when I wouldnt do my homework and my mom would make her do hers,, it made her really pissed. I never blamed it on my autism. I just.. felt bad after I acted like such an asshole to my sister all those years. I still am an asshole..but I try not to show that side of me to my sister as much as possible..I kinda.. have a problem with me. I have an obsessive side of me that becomes fixated on someone who hurt me and I have feelings where I will just target them and yell at them for hours..that's basically what happened to her..where I wouldnt stop until I felt satisfied with my hunger to hurt her emotionally..I know..its really bad..and I hate that it's a part of me..but we grow older .. and hopefully he might grow out of it too"
