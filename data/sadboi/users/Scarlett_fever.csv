VeganFoodPorn,fllm9ae,t1_fll1uso,1585263236.0,"Copy/pasted from u/blu3sky3 :)


Dough

3 cup flour + some for kneading 1.5 tsp yeast + 2 tbsp warm water + a lil sugar 1 tbsp flax meal + 3 tbsp warm water 3/4 c oat milk 1/4 c sugar 1/2 tsp salt 5 tbsp earth balance butter 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

Glaze

1 c icing sugar 3 tbsp oat milk 1/4 tsp cinnamon

1.	⁠Mix yeast with warm water and sugar, let sit for 10 minutes
2.	⁠Make flax egg with flax meal and water
3.	⁠Put everything into a mixing bowl, except 1 cup of flour, and mix until dough forms (2-3 min)
4.	⁠Flour working surface with leftover flour and knead for 5-10 minutes, slowly incorporating the rest of the flour
5.	⁠Put in an oiled bowl, cover, and let rise for an hour. Make icing now (want it to be slightly runny but now so much that it just falls off the donuts)
6.	⁠Once doubled in size, roll out to 1/2 inch thickness and cut out donut shapes (male donut holes with extras!)
7.	⁠Place on floured baking sheet and cover, let rise for 30 minutes.
8.	⁠Heat 2” of oil to about 175c or 350f
9.	⁠Once dough and oil is ready, gently insert donuts into oil and fry each side for a minute or until golden brown
10.	⁠Put on drying rack to cool.
11.	⁠Once slightly cooled, dip top into glaze and let it cool completely!
12.	⁠Enjoy!"

 Someone really close to me recently told me to stop complaining about how badly I feel, so now I don’t tell anyone. I didn’t think I was that bad, but I’d rather just not be a burden. 

When I start to feel better I get worried too, like why am I feeling better? Or I feel like my brain is taunting me, showing me what my life could be like when in reality I’ll be back to feeling like shit soon enough.

Don’t be afraid of feeling better for a little bit, just try to soak it in. It’s like coming up for air when you’re drowning. And come tell us about it :)"

I think she was going to fire me to cover her own ass, I got really frustrated and quit.

I don’t mind losing the job, but on top of everything else, my coworker was one of the only people keeping me sane and now there’s no reason for us to see each other.
