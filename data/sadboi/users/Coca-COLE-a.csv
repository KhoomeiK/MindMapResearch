I’m gonna say the band and then a song you can listen to to get a taste of the band.

Liily—Toro

Citizen—Jet

Movements—Daylily

Fiddlehead—Lay Low (Fiddlehead is a collab band with some Basement members)

Neck Deep—In Bloom

Stand Atlantic—Lavender Bones

Man Overboard—Montrose (personally not my favorite but maybe you’ll like)

Relient K—Who I am Hates Who I’ve Been
