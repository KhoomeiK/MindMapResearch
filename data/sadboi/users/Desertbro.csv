Imagine all those goons who work for a super-villain just doing mediocre maintenance and paperwork - that's kinda where I'm at.  It's kinda soul-destroying...but a different job did that to me a while back, so now I'm just kinda inert.

Doesn't matter much to me whether I keep this job or move to the next one...my drive is gone.  Just trying to keep the web services on so I can watch silly movies and TV shows.  Don't weep for me, when I had it good, I travelled the world and had lots of fun - I did not miss out."

I'd spend hours in a dark room filming hundreds of documents, then come out, and visually spot-check all the microfiche.  This was in the 80s before everything went digital.

AskMenOver30,fqmw49m,t3_gjmmou,1589484511.0,"I built animated graphics for online technical courseware - mostly about Microsoft, Intel, and Cisco stuff, but there were dozens of other clients.  My company had most of the dot-boom perks, flex-time, soda was a quarter, easy-going managers, every employee had agency to alter or adapt the product to be better.  

I had a storyboard of what the animation was supposed to do - I could alter the layout to suit the visual space if I needed to, or I could walk it back to the design stage and ask for a different solution, because the one they gave me was not good.

I was there seven (7) years, and I worked on stuff at home to improve my skills, also did overtime two summers, because I really loved the work.  Also, got along pretty well with the people there - lots of graphics people who loved comics, sci-fi, fantasy, gaming, etc.  Until the company was bought out, people had a lot of geek stuff at their desks. 

Real world caught up to it.  Although our courseware was the most detailed, thorough, and visually beautiful .... it was like a Ferrari in a world of Chevys.  So...everyone was buying Chevys of course.  Company was sold to an org with deeper pockets, and the culture was made more ""corporate"".  The fun faded away, then the corp sold us to the competition, who dismantled the whole operation and only re-sold the existing library.

One woman was a champion, thought.  She just wanted to ride a bike for a day.  She was in Australian when we connected, made a date, showed up, rode a bike, had a good time outside.  It was understood it would be our only meet, she only wanted to ride a bike.  No problem, but it was great she had no hang-ups or excuses."
Bumble,fqmfi71,t1_fqm3hec,1589476588.0,"This one is the most disturbing, the ""Bonnie/Clyde"" reference. Do these people know anything about this criminal pair?

1. **She Was Unfaithful** \- Bonnie and Clyde met in Texas in January, 1930. At the time, *Bonnie was 19 and married to an imprisoned murderer*; Clyde was 21 and unmarried. Soon after, he was arrested for a burglary and sent to jail. He escaped, using a gun Bonnie had smuggled to him, was recaptured and was sent back to prison. Clyde was paroled in February 1932, rejoined Bonnie, and resumed a life of crime. 
2. **They Were Anti-Social** \- In addition to the automobile theft charge, Bonnie and Clyde were suspects in other crimes. At the time they were killed in 1934, they were believed to have committed 13 murders and several robberies and burglaries. 
3. **They Were Literally Shot-to-Death** \-  Before dawn on May 23, 1934, a posse composed of police officers from Louisiana and Texas, including Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, concealed themselves in bushes along the highway near Sailes, Louisiana. In the early daylight, Bonnie and Clyde appeared in an automobile and when they attempted to drive away, the officers opened fire. Bonnie and Clyde were killed instantly. 

Not a great romance story."
