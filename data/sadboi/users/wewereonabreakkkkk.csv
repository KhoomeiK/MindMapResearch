SuicideWatch,f2u5mt9,t3_d1fx4w,1570407969.0,"i understand, but i promise ur not alone. i attempted suicide(overdose) almost 4 months ago and had to be rushed to hospital. seeing all these sick people made me feel tremendous guilt about what I had just done yet it made me wish that I was dead even more in a way, I wanted to give my life away, away to anyone who would cherish it more than I have been doing... I wanted to just disappear and for people to blame my body/health for leaving, not me. but i promise u no matter how concrete and real these feelings become, u are not alone and should feel no guilt for being alive. even if u wish u weren’t, don’t ever feel guilty for being here. u deserve it as much as anybody else. u are loved and u are one of a kind. u deserve the world and more."
