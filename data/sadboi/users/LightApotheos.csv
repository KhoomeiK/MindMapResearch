i tried to smoke the crazy out of me
but crazy he dont scare so easily

my eyes are red but i can see
o my my my my my my my my my my my mistress's creed

the plan falls apart every day
so i try to cause everybody i know away

saw you so much had nothing to say
god im blown served up on a silver tray

chorus:

oh my god how could i say that??
that body was number to me tell me how did it feel to you??

but its getting loud
lets you fight to pow pow pow

but do you think that you were full
but do you think that im a slut?

i said dont worry use your hands
wrong day wrong shoes wrong had no demand

got me tied all crust up tastes like sand
for with that which happened always had no bear

set this back try to make all things faster
whatre you trying to make of that - i dont wanna see it

made you look like a gal and tried to force it
i will stay away and wait for it to spread spread spread

i stutter start your name
you hold it over my head

misnomer it all tastes the same
when your tastebuds go dead

dont wanna talk about flaws but youre exposing her
youre sticking it deep inside then who flows to point the finger

dont wanna talk about flaws but youre exposing her

A mod told me he was going to kill my entire family, called me a c*nt. Brought this up with /u/mary4q (she was in the vc), she didn't care. Mods use r-word and other slurs over and over. 

They accept fash in the server. 

Don't forget the whole 'owner masturbated with a minor in vc' thing. 

Also, they have 'resource usage rules', which means you cant make tools with the ores you dig up. Doesn't really matter if you're lucky, since the admins randomly give out maxed gear to people who kiss their ass in vc (i know this bc i did it).

The server's been up for only a week, the owner/admins have v little experience running servers decently, and they condone a toxic atmosphere."
