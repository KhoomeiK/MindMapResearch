financialindependence,fobnq8t,t3_g6jrf2,1587661711.0,"I know that a lot of savvy investors, like Todd tresidder at financial mentor, are advocating to sit on cash. To do absolutely nothing for a year or more.

 Because they have no idea where the markets are going to go, or what's even going to happen with the economy. They're saying this is unprecedented, so you can't even determine if there's real opportunity. 

I mean, obviously there's real opportunity. But they mean, no one witj even remote certainty can predict where things are going to go

Personally, perhaps you should reframe you're thinking? Rather than missed opportunities, be grateful that you're sitting on cash! Seriously!

I'm in real estate and have a moderate risk profile. But I'll tell you what, right now:
* I'm very glad I have very little leverage. 
* I'm glad to be sitting on cash.
* I'm glad that I paid off my primary residence a few months ago, even though theoretically, I could make higher returns in the market.

 but paying off that mortgage is it guaranteed return, which I will never regret. (And ironically, the most successful people I know in real estate all have their primary residence owned free and clear. Basic motto is: make sure your homestead is always taken care of first. This allows you the freedom to use leverage and risk in investing / business pursuits, not in managing in your day-to-day life.)

sorry I got out of soap box!

 I just want to say that I know what it's like to get in your head and regret missed opportunities. The reality is, they weren't really missed, cuz you're doing the best you can do.

And from an outsider's perspective, and everything I've read and learned, I think you're in a fantastic position. I think you're in a 10 out of 10 position! One that you'll be grateful for more and more each day over the coming months and next several years.

realestateinvesting,fnax844,t1_fn5dhuj,1586805420.0,"You're welcome for my comment. 

And I agree with everything you wrote here in your reply. I suppose I should have put in context my comment about it being 100% And investors fault if they're over-leveraged. 

I had a specific type of investor in mind, name one of the person with a handful of properties that just kept cashing out equity to acquire more doors. 

Obviously, this isn't every type of investor. What is very common here on Reddit in this group.

So I agree completely with what you wrote about investors being blindsided through no fault of their own. I mean, who really does predict for a pandemic?

The spirit of my point, was more people totally ignoring the risks of leverage, and only focusing on the upside; or, potential upside. 

Risk isn't bad. Neither is leverage. That's the power and beauty of real estate. 

What is bad is over-leveraged or turning a blind eye to risk. And unfortunately, that's the position many, many investors are in. 

Regarding the banks and your comment about the 20% who may be forced to sell or want to sell, yes I agree that they will try to sell. 

The question is, if they are in the position that they have to sell, will they be able to at terms that work?

Specifically, even if they personally agreed to a loss, the lender would have to agree to a short sale. So if I cash investor comes in and offers 50% of a ARV, the lender would have to agree.

NO WAY will that be happening quickly. And evaluating short sales will be far, far down the list of priorities for lenders once everything picks up again. 

I think the investors that are in the position to only have 3 or 6 months of rent coverage are in for a tough go over the next year. 

They may not lose the property because of the freeze on mortgages and foreclosures. But they're going to have one hell of a hole to try to dig out of after this is all done. Especially if they're in a hole after only losing a few months worth of rent, and their numbers not working with even a three-month blip. 

and regarding gambling, out here in Seattle, which is one of the hottest markets in the country and has been for 5 years, it's full-on gambling  most small investors. 

The auctions dried up about four years ago, and I stopped trying to do any buy and rehabs about 2 years ago because I just don't have deep enough pockets. and my risk tolerance isn't as high. But I think the risk tolerance in this market isn't even risk, it's foolishness. 

Most investors are now paying to 80% of the ARV for a flip. The people who this model works for are the people you are buying and selling 40 or 50 houses a year. I know a few of them, and they have deep enough pockets where they tell me that if they make money on a 2 out of 10 deals, they're good for the year. 

I am not in that position, nor are most of the other investors I know. We need to make money on each deal, and above all, not lose money. 

But I see person after person just buying whatever so that they're in the game out here, assuming the markets just going to go up or that people will bid the property up. 

this is not investing. This is gambling. I would never bet on appreciation or the bidding up of a property. but it's been happening here for the last four to five years, and it's only gotten worse because there so few properties available. 

so I just decided to go on the sidelines a couple of years ago, hold on to what I have, and then just have reserves when either a market correction or market opportunity (I.e. a change in zoning density to allow for more units per lot) appears.

And after this pandemic, we're a lot closer to those opportunities than we were even a few months ago. 

So I think you're very wise to get clear on your own personal risk threshold and where that falls versus gambling FOR YOU personally. 

Sounds like you're already doing that and that you were in a good spot.

Leverage cuts both ways. Yet people ignore this during high times.

Second, in my opinion, I believe what you're thinking here is correct. But I disagree with your timeline. 

There will not be any shake-up in property defaults or liquidations for many many months. Maybe not for the rest of the year.

The mortgage markets have Frozen. Courts are shut and will be backlog when they reopen. and it appears most mortgage holders will be able to halt payments for up to a year.

 And, if what you propose actually happens, the banks are going to have more incentive to work with existing mortgage holders, than repossess and auction off at significant losses. 

All that written, I've actually had similar thoughts to you. There are - a lot - of investors who are way over leveraged.

I've completed 3 full gut rehabs within the city limits of Seattle in the last 4 years.

These took me 7-13 my months, working 6.5 days week, 10 hour days. I could have completed in 3 months if I had had the bank balance to write checks for all of the work.

Now, I'm going to give you the cold hard truth. And it's not what you're going to want to read. 

It's really as simple as this: what collateral do you have that the bank can you use to secure the loan?

I think I already know the answer, and I'm not trying to be a smart-ass. But that's exactly what the bank is going to require. 

Having a good credit score, if not excellent credit score, is a given. 

On top of this, again not trying to be a jerk, you have no history / experience / track record of success in the real estate business you are wanting to start. You haven't run this business before. So, You're basically asking the bank to gamble on your ability to succeed, with no demonstrated experience that you can do so. 

Here is my experience with banks: when you're first starting out and really need the money, it's very difficult to get money. However, once you have success and don't really need financing, it's very easy to get money. 

My suggestion: find an experienced investor that you can work with, in any form. Think about what you can bring to the relationship, and begin contacting people. 

Also, begin looking for your own deals. If you find a good enough deal, it won't be hard to find the money. You're just not going to get it through a bank. 

and before you start finding your own deals, you should probably backtrack 100 deals. Meaning, evaluate 100 properties, ideally active listings. Run your own numbers, and then come back to them in the near future to see what the results are. this is tangible, real-world experience that you can use once you get started.

These are long-term rentals, in essence a lease. But as I understand it, he only has the occupant sign a 29 or 30 day agreement. I don't recall the exact details. 

but the point is, however he has it set up, the property gets treated like a hotel in terms of his protecting his eviction rights. meaning, he can call the police, just like you would at a hotel or motel, if the occupant doesn't pay.

More importantly, the guest/renter pays upfront, and this is handled through Airbnb.

Again, I'm not an attorney and I don't have first-hand experience in this. And I'm not sure what technically establishes residency versus a short term rental. I'm assuming he keeps all the bills, for example, in his name.

 But his whole point was to make sure that a couple of these tenants didn't establish actual residency / tenancy because he was very concerned about their ability to pay. And doesn't want to have to deal with the prolonged eviction process through the courts. 

this could be totally illegal. Or, it could be something worth looking into to cover you for the short-term.

And hell, even if it was technically illegal, the spirit of it isn't.

And I really despise quotes like this because it makes the person who's trying their hardest, end up feeling worse and bad about themselves, because they just couldn't 'think' their way out of it. or that they were manifesting or creating their suffering, and just weren't trying hard enough. 

It's the trauma and imbalances that keep pulling your brain from the present, not allowing it to function properly or healthily. 

It's a bunch of hogwash."
Codependency,fkhx6s7,t1_fkhw7qm,1584207654.0,"In my extensive personal experience, and seeing many family and friends, and attending many coda meetings...

I've come to the conclusion that it's virtually impossible for two people, who are both codependent in an existing relationship, to get healthy together or save the relationship. It's gets multiplied tenfold if either one of them is an addict, like I was, let alone both. 

 There's just too much history, baggage and drama to overcome. more importantly, and an extremely bigger challenge, is there so much inner healing that has to be done. And that's assuming both even actually get healthy.

When the reality is, you'll be doing very well yourself just to get healthy yourself, let alone hoping / wishing waiting / prodding for your partner to get healthy too. 

Not impossible. But I'm 48, I tried this and many very long-term relationships. And I've seen many many people try to do this and all the different support groups I go to. And not only do I think it's virtually impossible, I think it's so unhealthy and unloving to yourself. 

You must rescue, save, and heal yourself. First. And only.

Once you do that, like months if not years down the road, you can get back into a relationship.

This is what I've been doing. I've been working on codependency stuff for more than 10 years. But was in this exact same situation about six months ago.

That ended, I didn't think I'd survive. But now I've healed more, I'm realizing how much this time alone and on my own is sacred and healing to me. 

And I can't even imagine trying to get into another relationship without first becoming even more clear on exactly what I want, what I value, and what I need.

Knowing what I know now from what I've experienced, I'd run, not walk, away from any kind of reunion here.

stopdrinking,fjya0rm,t1_fjy727u,1583692688.0,"I agree with tturkan. that sounds like the kind of reaction you would have with antabuse, yet I highly doubt they messed up your prescription. 

But this is a very extreme and uncommon reaction with naltrexone. You should definitely talk to your doctor, and common sense says you should stop taking it until you talk to your doctor.

For what it's worth, I took naltrexone for 4 months. I never drink more than I did during that phase. However, I had no side effects or other abnormal reactions. I simply drank as much as I ever did before.

That written, the Sinclair method with naltrexone has a very high success rate. It just didn't work for me. So definitely talk to your doctor and see what's up here, because you should not be having this kind of reaction.

and you should talk with your doctor about any other contraindications either with supplements or other medications you may be taking.

I'm 48 years old. Yeah, I have known I was too codependent since about 18. It took me decades to finally begin healing, even while living, everyday, with the awareness that I was abandoning myself in choosing security of the known because I was so afraid of being alone. 

So please no my post was praised for you, not critiquing you negatively. Because what you wrote and that 1 picture, took me about 10 years to get clear on on myself.

And it finally hit me upside the head, then if I wasn't clear on what I did want, all I had to do was list all the things I didn't want, and think about what the opposite is of that.

Once I started doing that, it helped so much. Let me be clear, I'm still very clear on what I don't want. Fact, I'm a master of telling myself and people that. It's just that for me, once I reframed it to what I actually want and need and value, I found I became much more supportive, accepting, and encouraging of myself. I guess I best basically became a better friend to myself. 

So know that you are doing fantastic! Because with codependency, with like so many issues, the first step is just getting clear that we're stuck. In the easiest way to do that is list everything that's wrong and everything that we don't want more of. 

the truth is, if you read the reply that you wrote to me, you intuitively already working on what you do want! that, you listen several things in that reply that you want. And even wrote that you want that you actually want to begin making a list of what you want!

This is fantastic! Again, my original comment was more prodding and encouraging then it was critiquing you. And it worked, because it seems you're even more clear now I'm things you do want and inspire for then you were hours ago. And that's terrific. 

thanks a lot for your reply. More importantly thanks a lot for making your original post. You're already healing, and well on your way to a full recovery. And I couldn't be happier for you. üòä Thomas

I really like the doctor performing the dtms. He's open-minded, very knowledgeable, and very responsive. I've asked him about the suggestions you made here. I'll see what he says. 

he did say that my experiences are very rare, both with a figure 8 coil eye pain. And then the actual feeling of pain with the deep TMS. Both he and the different technicians have said this is very uncommon. 

But he did say there is a lot of different approaches still in the bag. 
* he mentioned something about a theater bursts for 3 minutes. 

* He also talked about splitting up the frequency and or duration of sessions. Like not going more than two days in a row.

*He also mentioned just staying at a lower power threshold, even though the ideal he said, was to be at a hundred to 120.

So I'm very hopeful things will improve. But like I was saying, that nerve pain in my teeth was not discomfort it was pain. And it continued for about a day along with the soreness in the masseter muscle in my jaw. 

I'll keep you posted it again thank you so much for your help! Thomas. üòä

I'm about a 1 week into the brainsway deepTMS treatment. 

We've only made it to about 105% power. I am experiencing moderate to significant pain of the nerves that feed my upper teeth on the left and right side. in fact, I had to stop the session today after only about 3 minutes, because even with all the manipulations of the helmet, the nerve pain made me jump out of the chair. 

I have been told they have not seen this before. That they sometimes see jaw and masseter pain, which I'm also experiencing but this is only soreness. But the actual nerve pain of the upper teeth, they have not experienced. 

Have you ever experienced this with patients? 
And do you have any suggestions of alternate placement?
And do you have thoughts about the effectiveness if we kept the power level below 100%?

I can say that in the past week, placebo or not, I've had more energy, and it should've and feeling better. And I really want to continue with TMS. 

 and they have the helmet angled on my right side so it's targeting the left dlpfc. But even when they move the helmet around, it just spreads the impact from only the nerve on the right upper teeth to the nerves of both upper teeth.

I've been going to CODA meetings regularly for the past six months. I went about 3 or 4 years ago for a month, and it just didn't jive with me at the time. 

You wrote that you found ""class"". If the schedule is weekly, I'm assuming this is the regular coda meetings.

If it is, then yes, all the meetings are free. When you attend, it's normal to be nervous the first few times. But it's actually a very reserved and calming place. 

There is no expectation to share. So don't feel like you have to, open when there's silence. There are many people grab not spoken once the entire time that I've attended. But clearly they're getting benefit from attending and being around like-minded people who are trying to heal. 

Also, during every meeting, they pass around a basket for donations. Most people put in a dollar. But a donation is not required. And the the leader of the group for that night will specifically say that people attending their first second or third meeting, do not make any donation. You're just there to check out the group. 

at the beginning of the group, they'll also ask if this is anybody's first second or third meeting. Don't be shy about raising your hand. They should also give you a hand out that overviews Kota and explains all the things that the leader talks about / reads at the opening of the meeting. if they don't give you a handout, feel free to ask them if there's any printed information you can look at. I mean, feel free to ask that right at the beginning of the meeting so that you can read along as they are explaining the process. 

the meetings usually start with about 10 to 15 minutes of the leader reviewing all the cota guidelines. And by the way, and most groups, there is no real leader for the group. It's just someone picks up the binder for that night, and access the leader or the guide. But they all follow the same exact flow and instructions.

Then, and the groups I've attended, people take turns reading from a cota book for about 10 minutes. And then that leaves about 1 hour we're people have time to share for about 3 to 4 minutes each whatever they want to share. This is the part where I'm saying don't feel compelled to share. But definitely do if you want to!

Anyway, I hope this helps ease any concerns or fears. I've been to several coda groups, and they really are friendly and low key. So you'll be fine!

Oh, I believe my overall experience with the VA is the exception. MANY of the men and women in the groups I attend share experiences similar to your friends and family.

Part of my ""luck"" is through sheer force. I'm intelligent, I can research, and I still have the ability to push/fight. Unfortunately, many of our fellow soldiers aren't in the same spot/have the same capabilities because of what they've gone through. And the VA can play ping pong with them and their health. My heart goes out to every one of them.

Thanks for the info on the blood tests. I did have my blood work done two weeks ago through the VA. I forced it.

However, I was told my results are 'normal'. Even though total test was only 280, fasted first thing in the morning. And this is with me being active and lifting. So, they won't refer to endocrinology.

So, I'm going to do as you did. Go oustide. And then, see if I can come back inside.

I found two YouTube interview videos by a Dr. Keith Nichols. I am stopping my research there for the time being. And am contacting him.

I appreciate your willingness and desire to help. I understand that you're very busy and have MANY other things going in live.

Testosterone,fiwgm0u,t1_fiqz5t4,1582785160.0,"Hi Cloud.

First, THANK YOU VERY MUCH for the time spent in writing your reply, and the detail. I really appreciate it.

Second, thank you for your service. Man, sounds like it's been a tough go. Both over there, and here, with everything culminating seemingly at once. I'm glad that you're okay... and even more, that you're still continuing on and still hopeful. Good for you. :-)

I can relate to the VA wanting to push meds. I have several mental health diagnosis. Have for nearly 20 years. And I stopped all medication about 15 years ago. All of them, and in all combinations, made me worse. Yet... that's STILL the main tool the VA wants to use. So I'm glad you declined all that.

You T sounds as low as mine. Just had the test results follow up last week. My total T was 280, the absolute bottom end of ""normal"". (BTW... up until about 3 years, the ""normal"" range Lab Corp used was about 330. So, they just keep lowering what normal is.) And I workout/lift, eat decent/a lot of protein and healthy fat, etc. And they said T wasn't an issue.  I went to three different docs and they wouldn't refer me to endocrinology. Sounds just like your deal.

I'm VERY happy for you that you're finally getting treatment. I bet it will be life changing for you. Sounds like you're already experiencing improvements. Good for you.

My overall experience with the VA has been very positive. I've been eligible for care for nearly 25 years, but only sought treatment this past May for suicidal depression. 

The care I've received in mental health, physical therapy, and ear/nose/throat for surgery and sleep apnea treatment has been terrific. My doctors have all been open minded, curious, and listened to alternative treatments/therapies outside of drugs/pharmaceuticals, even some therapies they personally have never prescribed.

However, my primary care provider(s) (I fired one and got another), and their ignorance, ego and stubbornness, have been my biggest hurdles. They have acted as gatekeepers and screeners, rather than partners.

Never more so than with my request for endocrine tests (i.e. thyroid, testosterone, etc.) and a referral to endocrinology. It's just not happening.

And, as you wrote in your suggestion to seek outside care for the testosterone/hormone issue, the more I've learned about the VA endocrinology department and doctors, the more I'm convinced they wouldn't know what do do, anyway.

So, I'm taking your suggestion. I'm going to seek an outside provider. This is no different than what I'm already doing for mental health. I don't take any medications, but found an M.D. that focuses on targeted nutrient therapy. He does my bloodwork and writes a custom compounded nutrient prescription. The VA couldn't fill this, anyway.  As it's only vitamins/minerals, not drugs. I had to pay about $1000 for the initial consult; $400 for initial tests, and then my supplements are about $120/mo. Sounds like hormone/testosterone therapy will be similar. And, will be worth every penny.

Because the hormones amplify the depression, anxiety and mood cycles I experience. Even more, however, is the quality of life. The absolute apathy and lack of motivation/initiative is what eats at me the most. I'm NOT lazy, or a victim. Yet, it is literally just so hard physically and mentally to do/pursue/complete what I used to. My threshold for overwhelm has dramatically decreased. And I just want to feel ""normal"" again; normal energy, initiative and outlook. I'm NOT look for super energy or to be the Energize Bunny! just normal, stable and consistent.

So, I'm going to get outside care. And then, once I'm rolling, talk with my psychiatrist to see if she can take over the prescription so I can get through the VA. (Assuming the VA even prescribes what is recommended, like shots vs gel or pellets).

I'd love to read more about your progress. And thanks again for taking the time to reply. I really, really appreciate it.

In fact, not only did it not work. I literally drank more that at any point in my 20 years of drinking. I was 100% compliant, and never missed a dose. 

That written, I would 100% try it. Its success rate, especially compared to most other methods, is very impressive.

And I would highly recommend you try it as well. Because it has helped so many other people. 

And for what it's worth, I was finally able to stop drinking in September of 2017. 

And I believe that the fact that I took the medication, despite its ineffectiveness, still provided some benefit subconsciously to help me quit.

Any thoughts on this?

rtms,filp0fo,t1_fiits67,1582506844.0,"Dr. Kent,

THANK YOU SO MUCH for taking the time to reply. And especially, to reply with specific recommendations. 

Do most doctors/providers know about the different protocols for depression? 

And does deep TMS also have multiple protocols for depression?

I really appreciate your opinion about the overall effectiveness of deep TMS vs. Rtms. It sounds like it just hits at a broader range, so it has a better chance to hit the mark. 

I am calling the office tomorrow morning to tell them I want to switch to the deep TMS unit. So hopefully it works out.

And I'm going to come back on here to post an update and let you know how things progress. 

Again, Doctor Kent, I'm very grateful for you creating this thread and opening it to answer questions. You're not even my doctor, yet you're providing information that has not been explained to me. And I'm very very grateful. 

Please continue doing the work you're doing. Because I know you are helping many many people live better lives.

Also Google dr. Jim Phelps thyroid. He's a psychiatrist out of Portland Oregon, his website might be psychcentral. Anyway, if you Google his name and thyroid you'll find a ton of good information. He actually wrote a three-page review of dr. Kelly's book and how thyroid medication is used in bipolar treatment.

for what it's worth, his entire website is devoted to bipolar and the whole unipolar to bipolar Continuum. He doesn't view diagnosis as static, but more like a Continuum. And he provides a ton of free information on the website, and doesn't actually sell anything.

Thank you for offering to answer questions. 

1. Do you agree with my assessment that I should switch to deep TMS from rtms after only three visits?

2. If not, how many more visits with rtms would you attempt to find the right spot?

3. And how much is efficacy compromised if there's more than desired distance between the coil and head, or the coil is at an angle?

I'm receiving TMS to treat MDD with a bipolar 2 label. 

I've had 3 sessions with rTMS using a MagVenture Pro machine with  cool B-70 coil. 

I experience moderate to significant eye pain at the top front-to-middle of my left eye during the session. When it gets to about a 7 out of 10, which I would be unable to sit through an entire session of taps, I tell them they have to back off the power or move the location. There's no way I can get to even 100% power, let alone 120% power, at the ideal location. It remains about 4 out of 10 on a pain threshold during the entire session.  

The coil placement has been manipulated more than a dozen times in three days. And the ends of the coil are not equidistant from my head. So it's shooting at a slight angle. Yet, during my testing, and each day, the location that activates the greatest motor response, also causes the most pain.

Today, the onset of eye pain (aside from the pain during the session, which is mild, but constant) began about 4 hours after treatment. And it's gotten progressively worse as I now near 11 hours since treatment.

it's not severe, but it's more than uncomfortable. My left eye, above my inner eye, and the left side of my head feel slightly painful and sore. However, the actual location and tapping on my scalp doesn't bother me at all. 

I was advised that there were many more manipulations they could do with the rtMS, including putting a sponge between each end of the coil. Either way, however, and reading your comments, it sounds like with even perfect placement, rtms can miss the mark by 30%. 

I've continually asked how these manipulations affect efficacy, specifically the angling of the coil. And I've been reassured that it will hit close enough (my words). I - continually - ask about the possibility of compromising efficacy, and I'm told that it will be okay. 

I've been told their treatment results have been about equal with either the Brainsway and Magventure. 

However, when I drilled down as to why one type of TMS would be recommend over the other, and what percentage of patients used either technology, I was told that they have many rtms machines. But only one deep TMS machine. 

I'll be truly grateful for any advice or expertise you can share. I've been in a real bad way this past year. The worst in my 28 years of dealing with the mood cycles and depression. And TMS is about my last resort. 

 FWIW, this spring, I may be moving to one of the locations where you listed that you practice. I'll definitely look you up if I move there.

Codependency,fgqqybs,t3_ezxb5a,1581029611.0,"Actually, I believe you're already well on your path to healing / improving. 

Awareness is actually the first step. You can't change anything without awareness, what do you have.

After awareness, becomes personal accountability/responsibility. Reading your post, you have that, too. 

I'm in a very similar point in my healing journey as you. And I've read tons and tons on codependency, go to support group meetings, in practice active healing.

After all this, I found that what works for me on my own personal path, is to literally question every single thought impulse I have to give / help / advise / assist / another person. 

While I'm intense about this, I'm very informal and not obsessive. I had too many years of doing that!

So now, what I recognize my impulse or near action to do / give the someone, I stop and questioned it. With questions like: did this person ask for my help? If he or she did, do I want to help? Why am I considering doing this action right now?

what I mean by informal is, I just kind of have this dialogue with myself, in the moment. For example, yesterday I was near a habitat for humanity and Goodwill outlet store. I have a close friend who's in need of bedroom furniture for her daughters. Specifically a dresser. 

Well, I was literally passing the stores after leaving Costco. I was in my truck and had my trailer with me. and I thought to myself, hey, I'll just pop in there and see if there's a dresser that I can pick up for her.

But I'm about two months now and they're practicing catching myself, and I realized, that while generous and kind, this help wasn't asked for. And probably more importantly for me, no matter what her situation or why, it's not my responsibility. 

But the funny thing is, it was only in my mind, with my own mind, that was thinking it was my responsibility to help. She never asked me to do anything. 

for me, I made the conscious decision 3 months ago to stop helping everyone with everything for an indefinite. Of time. This is not to be mean or rude or selfish. 

Instead, I've done so because I needed to protect me from me. Me, and my compulsive need for caretaking and thus trampling the boundaries of others, I've been hurting me. 

I Am naturally an empath. I'm a kind, generous, supportive person. 

Yet, giving and caretaking is how I felt needed and validated myself internally. But by doing so, I've actually completely invalidated myself and distanced myself from who I truly am and what I truly need. 

And by automatically saying no (internally) do every internal impulse to help / assist, I am healing. 

And it is becoming less difficult to separate kind and healthy giving / helping, vs compulsive and sickness- driven giving. But I had to stop everything to be able to recognize this difference. 

so my goal is to not stop being kind or generous, it's not to stop giving forever. And sad, it's about reparenting myself and educated myself as to what is healthy and proper giving in any given situation. 

because they are out is nice people do nice things for other people. And they are there for them in times of need. I don't want this ever to change for me. I really like that part part of me and admire it

But I can only truly give in a healthy way in the future if I amfirst aware of all the ways I do so in an unhealthy way, and then consciously take accountability and work through changing those Ways. 

I'm actually very surprised and pleased with how much progress I've made and only a few months, even though I've been aware of this issue for years. and I can feel intuitively that I'm much closer to the time where I'm going to be able to begin giving and assisting and a healthy way, without compulsion or covert contracts assigned. 

I wrote a ton about me here, but my reply is really for you. Because I hope something in what I wrote it's similar to what you may think feel or experience sometimes. And that are shared experience and common humanity and healing might help you in some way. 

Again, I think you should pat yourself on the back because your message reads of one of accountability and awareness. And those are the absolute starting points, the absolute requirements, to begin healing and changing. So good for you!

Bipolar 2 has the highest morbitity and suicide rate of any mental disorder. It's also the most difficult to treat. (I can pull the stats and cite sources. Or you can Google.)

This doesn't lessen the severity of bipolar 1 or unipolar depression. 

But so many people, including many doctors I've talked with, are completely ignorant about the actual severity of bipolar 2. 

Even today, twenty-something years after my diagnosis, I'm continually re-educating both my psychologist and psychiatrist, who are still so wrapped up in potential mania or hypomania. 

It's like all these people remember are the traits in movies like in silver linings playbook with Bradley Cooper. Where somebody cycles, and goes off the wall, totally manic, for days or a week at a time.

When in truth, in bipolar 2, it's a 40 to 1 ratio of time spent in depression vs. Hypomania. And for most people, as it has been for me, the depression drops lower and and lasts longer, than the Hypomania rises and lasts. 

I kind of got on of soap box here. The fact is, all mental disorders suck. And they're all equally valid. 

Yet, when evaluating the statistics objectively, unfortunately for us who have bipolar 2, it seems we drew the shortest straw of any mental disorder. Regardless of whether others dismiss it.

Like you wrote, you were young and ""dumb"" when this happened. We've all been through that phase of life, including the customs and immigration agent you'll be talking to. 

The agents themselves actually have a great deal of latitude and allowing entry, unless a person is on a watch list. You guys obviously aren't on a watch list. 

By the letter of the law, you wouldn't be allowed entry. 

But given the discretion of the agent involved, your country of origin, and your age, I think more than likely you will be admitted. 

But I wouldn't guarantee this. And you should really have a plan B for immediate return travel if you're denied entry. 

The most important thing, like I wrote previously, it's absolutely disclosed your history. Do not try to hide it. 

And if you do make the trip, I suggest acting completely ignorant about the U.S. laws regarding entry. Do not get into a debate.

In fact, do the opposite. Use your youth and charm. And act dumb, depressed, and defeated.

I'm a dude, and I can't tell you how much peace and comfort that book brought me. Yet, while it was excruciatingly painful to go through, I always held the light of Hope. 

I have more than 10 books on grief, codependency and loss. And I would put that book at the top. And I only found it after reading the codependency and no contact subreddits for like a month. Some other user was kind enough to post about it. 

She also later came out with a workbook, which I think is really good, too. Many people prefer the workbook, which I enjoy. But just the rawness and truthfulness of how she wrote her original book, how you can feel she had been through what I was going through in that moment, made all the difference for me. 

I think the biggest thing you'll take away from it, at least what I took away from it, is that every emotion that you're having is not only understandable, but normal and part of the grieving process. Along with the fact that you actually have to grieve. 

And, while rarely if ever talked about, abandonment grief can actually be even more painful and enduring, then loss by death.
Because death has finality to it. 

Yet, in a very painful breakup, either you or s/he willingly chose to leave the other person's life. And you have to deal with that loss, and grieve, while knowing that they are off living their life somewhere, somehow

 And I can attest to quality and severity of abandonment pain versus finality pain, having lost many people close to me through death, including a parent, sister, relatives and close friends.
