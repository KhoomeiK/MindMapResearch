rape,et1rxhm,t3_c6bx2v,1562402700.0,Omg. im so fucking happy for you. youâ€™re an amazing person and this is an amazing thing youâ€™ve done. iâ€™ve been reading rape/harassment stories recently and my heart aches for the people who lost their cases. women constantly are not able to prove that they were raped and it really sucks. it truly sucks. i think you would turn out to be an amazing lawyer! that part was random but itâ€™s how i feel. the way you go into detail about everything and all this shit would make you an amazing lawyer!
