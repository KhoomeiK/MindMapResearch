PsychiatricFreedom,fo0kc2t,t3_g4xqr7,1587414686.0,"I've dealt with pretty severe refractory Clinical Depression for 20 years now, you name the psych med, I've tried it, had ECT 28 times with only minimal effect. I dunno. Depression is absolutely a real disease in that it's like a chronic pain condition. Big D Depression, not the emotion of depression that everyone feels, should not share the same name because it minimizes in peoples minds a condition that many people actually prematurely end their lives to stop experiencing. It's like full-body nausea but you're never able to/can't muster the energy to throw up to relieve it.

And so I say all this as someone who now doesn't take any medication whatsoever (and can actually really feel things, now) but manages the discomfort, misery and boredom of my disease with just Cannabis and coffee. Quit drinking almost three months ago and will never go back but I am a lifelong stoner. I haven't darkened the doors of a psychiatrists office in months (got out quick last time when they tried to get me to deal with a Nurse Practitioner instead of an MD). You guys are walking prescription pads to me really. Of course there are good human beings who are psychiatrists, I just haven't personally really encountered any.

Can I ask you what you think of offering induced comas to acutely suicidal people to ease suffering as they do with severe burn victims? Maybe incorporating ketamine somehow. I have attempted suicide a few times and if two weeks of unconsciousness and a little muscle soreness and atrophy at the end of it were to be offered to me I would never even think of harming myself, if I knew such relief were to be offered to me, and I knew the medical profession treated my pain seriously.
Just curious what you think."

working there made my Depression ten thousand times worse: the monotony, cleaning up stranger's shit and piss and whatever else in the bathroom, the fluorescent lighting, the constant threat that somebody's going to walk in and end your life. holy fuck. no.
