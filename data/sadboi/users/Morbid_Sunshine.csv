Last episode he seemed to be sober, and it was nice!   The counseling he receives could help him learn how to deal with his anger and help him figure out why he always chooses chaos.  

Of course, wouldn't be feasible if he has to do jail time."

She tries to push herself into being a part of the group but I don't think she feels as if she is/should be; it's like she is desperately looking for validation.
