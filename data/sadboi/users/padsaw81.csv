I have always felt this way and hate how everyone is like,hold on in there things will get better but honestly I really don't want this life. It is truly wasted on me and all I am doing is waiting for the end. This is all I have longed for for over 30 years.i am truly existing for others. This is truly a selfish disease just not in the way everyone thinks."

(Started self harming at 7) now I am 38. I see so many people my age and younger surpassing me. I know it's not a race or competition I just feel like we are all cattle! Go to work all year and for what? I have managed to have 5 days off in two years now and am sick of the fucking battle. I feel like depression is closing in slowly but surely and to be honest it can have me. I hate this world it's not for me. I just long for it to end. I should never of had a family I don't deserve them and I know I am selfish for this. They deserve better and would be better off without  me. Sorry if I am venting."

depression,etkx2wj,t3_cbxda0,1562911869.0,I feel this a lot. When I think back I shudder and get a chill down my spine of the things I have done/said. I feel like i want to move away and start again where no one knows me and I can rectify my mistakes almost like pressing reset on a game. That would be heaven! Yet I know I cannot so I try and blank them out and every time I feel like self harming I make myself think of these things.to be honest I would cut myself ten times over rather than think back.(m38)
depression,et611lx,t3_c9z6zv,1562500385.0,Hi . I am 38 and have had this most of my life. I go to the gym and told I look good. BUT I do not feel this in any shape or form. I hate how I look and this really is a mental thing. I have found this the other way too when you find someone who looks attractive but once you get to know them they are so so ugly. Once you get to know someone they can become very attractive too so please don't hide away. Anyone worth knowing knows you should never judge a book by its cover and ignore all the bullies( easier said than done) if everyone was the same it would be a very boring world. There are a lot of nice people out there it's just fi find them. Good lucküëç
depression,esdytyu,t3_c77wnd,1561873734.0,"I feel pretty much the same. I am self employed and have a very physical  job,I feel like I need to work until I am exhausted each day otherwise I feel like a lazy bastard. Also I need the money. Once I have finished each day I throw myself  at crossfit which sort off helps but again it is so energy draining and I'm not getting any younger(38) I know it's not old but it takes its toll on the body. Any days I do have off I feel like a waster"

I have never been to a gym in my life and 2 years on it is honestly one of the best things I have done. Don't get me wrong I still have my cloud looking over but it has helped so so much.everyone is there for their own reasons(keeping fit, loose weight, look better or like me to fight this nightmare.) I will never win this battle but it's going to be my choice when it happens ."
