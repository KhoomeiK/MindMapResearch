BipolarReddit,fqsfj8l,t3_gknfqp,1589605895.0,I'm quite the opposite called in twice in last four years. My secret is night job. I work alone. Since I'm alone 24/7 at home might as well be paid for doing what I do. I mostly play video games at work but can do whatever to keep occupied. I'm a night auditor at a semi small hotel. This has been the only job I've managed to keep for some time.
BipolarReddit,fqoticm,t3_gjoayh,1589524395.0,"Here's my story my freshman year of high school was one big manic phase. At the time my parents put it off to normal teenage behavior. I actually went until I was 29 until my official diagnosis. 

2016 I started seeing a therapist and she brought up bipolar disorder and seeing a psychiatrist which I did and was diagnosed bipolar disorder type 1. General anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic, and mild agoraphobia. 

2017 I had a bad depressed episode and ate like a gram of seroquel and drank until I passed out. Well that was unsuccessful. Later that year I did intensive outpatient for 2 months. I learned a lot from the program. Group therapy really helped me more than 1 on 1. 

2018 and 2019 was experimenting with medications. I took a gene test and got on a good cocktail of medication. 

2020 has been great to me. Even though I was laid off for 2 months I never panicked or never went into a depressed episode. Current meds: triliptal. Rexulti, remeron, ativan, and ambien as needed."
BipolarReddit,fql87os,t3_gjilat,1589449697.0,You literally describe mania in your post. Stay on your meds we all doubt our diagnosis when feeling better.
BipolarReddit,fqgii5j,t3_gikaxh,1589347161.0,I feel like I've tried everything finally landed on trileptal  rexulti remeron ativan and ambien as needed. I feel alive and happy. I haven't self harmed in a while. My anxiety is under control. I actually have extra money in the bank!!! Took years and a gene test find my meds but it was worth it the whole way.
BipolarReddit,flq3biy,t1_flq01rt,1585377471.0,I'm not on an SSRI but I do take remeron and I haven't been taking it maybe that's related. Last night was awful and I want to try to prevent it from happening again.
thedivision,fjrcd90,t1_fjr0j02,1583583857.0,I have a pretty decent build. After trying a mix of red and blue and still getting killed fast I ended up settling on 6 red. While I don't hate the update I dislike parts of it. We went from one extreme to the next on elites compared to TU7. Removing damage to elites was a good move but then to up their armor?????? I feel like they should have let TU8 play out and then decide to adjust enemy armor in TU9 if needed. Overall I'm happy with everything except elite hp.

BipolarReddit,fitcd6m,t3_f9kgf7,1582714581.0,"What helps with my mixed state is making sure I'm on top of things. I try to keep my mind busy. Whether it's something simple personal hygiene. Keeping my living area clean. Small amounts of exercise. Maybe I'll read a chapter of a book. I don't give myself huge tasks so I can't really fail. Failure will feed the depression. I'll take small victories where i can get them. I isolate big time so I make sure I'm communicating with people in some way. Maybe a phone call to my mom to see what she's been up to lately. Maybe I've been putting off going grocery shopping. Maybe I do nothing and just have a day to take my meds, relax, and watch a movie. All of these things work for me. I may only do one or several it just depends on how I am that day. You just have to do you. My therapist suggested all of the above. So I try to do something off the list of things that we came up with for me."
legaladvice,fi9e821,t1_fi9dihj,1582262940.0,I haven't been served any papers yet. The county sheriff's department came by my work looking for me earlier today. My work tried to blow them off for now.

boas,feprtxs,t3_eqa1yq,1579329125.0,I use heat tape and I have my boa in a room that stays 80 degrees. So you’ll most likely want a radiant heat panel as well as heat tape. I keep my boa in an animal plastics t6 enclosure. The shipping time on these is around 4 months so you’ll want a tub for now. A boa that old should be eating rats not mice. I would do a small rat every 2 weeks. Feed frozen thawed don’t feed live. Boas will take it easily 90% of the time. Buy frozen rats online and keep them in the freezer. I use packing paper as a substrate it’s just the easiest for me. Pull it out wipe out enclosure put new stuff back. If you notice your boa getting fat you can spread out your feeding times. I feed monthly for example it’s working best to keep her weight in check.  My boa is a little over 3 years old this month. Not sure on her exact birthday but she was a baby when I got her. Ask all the questions you can think of and google everything. There’s tons of information out there. Good luck with your new friend when you get him/her.

I still don’t have god rolls on all the weapons I mess around with. I feel like there’s still content there it’s just more work to get it than before.

BipolarReddit,fdg2x9h,t3_el694g,1578378032.0,I’m the exact same way with my Valium. There’s such a stigma with benzos that 99% of the time I don’t take them. Everyone thinks I’m some sort of a drug addict. It sucks because on most days I do need them but rarely take them. I probably have 2 months worth at home where I haven’t taken them.
BipolarReddit,fdd5foj,t3_ekb79y,1578295597.0,I have horrible coping skills and it’s something I’m trying to work on. Just want to let you know in there with you with not knowing how to cope. I usually just isolate until it passes. I have other negative coping skills that I won’t mention. This is what I’m currently working on in therapy. I have a friend from the hospital that I usually try to message. Even if I’m isolating he’s always there to message. So I have one person that knows what I’m going through. He’s super supportive and helps a lot so in a way I guess that’s how I cope. Even if I’m isolating I still try to message him on Facebook.
BipolarReddit,fdd4xdr,t3_ekq8jy,1578294959.0,Nobody here can diagnose you with anything. Go see a therapist or psychiatrist. Sounds like you’re having normal mood swings. There’s more to bipolar disorder than happy and sad.
BipolarReddit,fdd4h0y,t3_ekotge,1578294403.0,Seroquel is a pretty common first med to try. The sleepiness is totally normal. Feeling like you don’t need the medication anymore is totally normal. Not sure what it’s like where you are but you need to get in with a therapist and/or a psychiatrist ASAP. This is your first step. Once you have an official diagnosis then you personally know. Don’t stop the seroquel no matter how good you may feel without talking to a doctor first. You can always tell the doctor the seroquel makes you too tired you don’t want that and want to try something different. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2. Then major depressive disorder. Then after an outpatient program bipolar disorder type 1. I had a manic episode that turned psychotic thanks to Wellbutrin. It’s a fine line the doctors have to walk and they are just being careful. So they don’t want to straight up give you an antidepressant. I was on max dose of vraylar when they added the Wellbutrin and it still made me manic. They are being super careful by giving you seroquel first. If they suspect bipolar disorder then roll with that for now.
BipolarReddit,fcmb076,t3_ehy5pa,1577769157.0,Right now I’m going through a medication change I see my psychiatrist every 2 weeks. My normal schedule is psychiatrist monthly and therapist weekly. They’ll never understand what you’re going through because they don’t experience the mood changes and/or side effects from medication. I honestly wouldn’t worry too much about their opinion. My mom thinks I go to my psychiatrist too much. She thinks I’m being used as a guinea pig. Just testing all this medication on me. That generation only went to the doctor when they were dying. My mom don’t believe in mental illnesses even though I was diagnosed with something when I was really young. She didn’t believe in getting me on medication. Which I believe led to me ruining my education in high school. She just put that off to normal teenager things. People that don’t experience what we do will never understand. You do you and just hang in there.
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fc7lrxd,t3_ege3qx,1577511588.0,I’ve fallen asleep before on my audit shift but it’s always been after all my work is finished. It’s tough sometimes especially for me I take a bunch of medication that makes me sleepy. That and I’m 100% alone all night. I’ve had week long periods where I’ve not even seen a guest come in to the office. That said if I didn’t close the day and have my work finished I would be out of a job in a second. I work at a small property where part of my audit shift is doing breakfast. I’ve fallen asleep after breakfast is setup watching the news many times. It’s usually no more than 30 mins because I notice right away and get up and walk the property. I don’t like coffee so I take a couple of caffeine pills every night. It’s a tough shift to work. I wish people would come in cussing me out every night like they do morning shift. At least I’d have that little bit of extra adrenaline to keep me awake easier lol.

bipolar,fbx4x24,t3_eevg42,1577169505.0,I quit reading the side effects years ago. My psychiatrist tells me if there is any important ones. You’ll drive yourself nuts if you start reading side effects especially on antipsychotics. My mom reads them and it’s like may cause death. Uhh driving my truck MAY cause death. I gave up on worrying though.
bipolar,fbtmguy,t3_eeepkj,1577084798.0,I’ve been diagnosed for almost 4 years now. Nobody believes me. Even though mental illness runs in my family. I have a sister diagnosed bipolar 1. I’m on meds and have never felt better. The meds do nothing though it’s all in my head.
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fbtlu0u,t3_eeffbc,1577083986.0,I had a silver member once want a 12:00pm checkout told him no since we were full house he got pissy he’s silver and it says he can have a 12:00pm checkout. Then I showed him the fine print where it says IF AVAILABLE. Talk about funny lol. My manager told me don’t put up with these people shit. They either checkout at 11:00am like it says or the cops escort them off the property. God I love where I work.
BipolarReddit,fbo2qul,t3_edgby6,1577006040.0,I tried a lot of antipsychotics. Vraylar has been life altering. I started on a low dose made my way to 6mg and I’ve been fine on it. The only side effect I’ve had is constipation which went away after about a month. I’m super tired the next day which I’ve read many places is most likely the vraylar. As much as I hate it I’m going off of it in 3 weeks to try something different. I changed my mood stabilizer from lamictal to trileptal and it’s been working better. So we are going to go with a different antipsychotic now. Still working on finding the right combo of meds 3 years now lol.
BipolarReddit,fbnxfe1,t3_edxvcw,1577004481.0,I don’t really care for coffee so I take a caffeine pill when I wake up. Then a few hours later I take another one. I’m not sure if this is a bad thing since it’s equal to about a cup of coffee. It’s not like I’m taking a handful just 2 a day. This helps me a ton with the sleepiness after waking up. I wouldn’t do this if you drink coffee when you wake up.
BipolarReddit,fbnwe9g,t3_ee0j03,1577004179.0,"I decided to be alone. I’m not sure if it’s just me or what but it became easy. I think personally it’s better for my mental health. I don’t have to worry about someone else’s feelings. It’s just me and my animals, which makes it all easier."
BipolarReddit,fbnvk9z,t3_edzmdw,1577003872.0,I’m the same just with different meds. I’m like this with my antipsychotic. I take my sleep meds fine but sometimes it’s just meh I can’t be bothered right now. I think we just get tired of it all sometimes. The routine becomes boring. I like to not feel boring. I like walking that fine line of mania.  I like the energy that comes from it. Then out of no where it’s like I better take this. I don’t know I think it’s just the routine of taking the meds.
BipolarReddit,fb3sbsn,t3_eb5m9e,1576486425.0,I’m not sure but I have stupid sleepiness and fall asleep at work. I just drink coffee and take caffeine pills and it seems to be enough to keep me awake until I get home and fall into a coma. Probably not the best way to deal with it but I can’t be sleeping at work so I do what I can. I take ambien too 10mg so maybe it is ambien that does it.
DestinyTheGame,f8b8cvd,t1_f8b856y,1574430220.0,Yes thanks!
DestinyTheGame,f8b6kye,t1_f8b6cai,1574428644.0,Yes I use the mod. I just can’t get through shields without that hand cannon. Seems. Like it does dumb damage to them. While my anti barrier rounds does nothing.

bipolar,f7kffjm,t3_dwkd55,1573807381.0,"I take 6mg of vraylar a day. It has been the best medication for my mixed episodes. Vraylar helps both depression, mania, and seasonal affective disorder. All of which I have. I take a lot of Valium though I’m not in a low dose. 20mg before bed 10 mg after I wake up. 400mg of lamictal a day too. Ambien to try to help me sleep on top of the Valium. I still don’t sleep lol. This mix of medication has been the best I’ve had in 3 years of trying though. I’ve honestly never had any problems on vraylar but I guess each person is different."

bipolar,f7kes6b,t3_dwm5ya,1573806392.0,You have to take latuda with 350 calories. Also it made me throw up. So I had to take another pill to prevent nausea.  Ended up not working for me. Everyone is different though could be the best thing in the world for you.
bipolar,f7kehld,t3_dwmex7,1573805963.0,I refuse antipsychotics that make you hungry. Went from 155 to 260 on seroquel. Finally back down to 200. I’m on vraylar now and I barely even eat and it’s perfect for me.
BipolarReddit,f7kctji,t3_dwfwsx,1573803644.0,I’ve experienced psychosis one time. My psychiatrist thought my antipsychotic was strong enough to add an antidepressant. Guess what it wasn’t. Full blown mania. I’ve never tried an injectable before. Doesn’t sound very fun though and sounds like a solution just for relief ASAP from psychosis. I wouldn’t do it yet personally. I would try other things first. Not sure what your lamictal level is but I’m up to 400mg a day. Just raising that could help you. Your psychiatrist knows way more than me though. If it was me i would say wait on the injections when you still have other options.
BipolarReddit,f7kaj8w,t3_dwmtmc,1573800671.0,"Only a mental health professional can diagnose you. Sounds like to me you just have anger issues that you need to fix. There’s more to bipolar than anger. Mostly my anger stems from my anxiety. You would 100% know if you were in hypomania, mania, or even depression. I haven’t slept more than 6 hours in 3 days. I’m moving towards hypomania. I feel like I’ve taken speed. This is what and up feels like. It’s not all smiles and happy times. You’ll max your credit cards without a care in the world. You could look for any sexual partner you could find. You can’t talk to people because you don’t give them a chance to answer. You also can’t talk to them because there’s no such thing as one subject. So you can either see a therapist which is recommend because like I said I think you just have anger issues. You can see a psychiatrist which is going to be way more expensive. Nobody here can diagnose you with bipolar disorder. Also raising your voice is a form of anger. You might think you’re calm but you’re not."
ballpython,f7go82h,t3_dvz0f0,1573710312.0,I rescued one off craigslist and the first thing they told me is she never sheds whole. By the second shed it was a full shed. Some people just neglect these animals because it’s just a snake not a dog or cat.
bipolar,f6rlbyn,t3_dsowut,1573108510.0,Congrats. I should have been diagnosed around that age I was manic as hell looking back. My parents put it off as normal teenage behavior. Also welcome to the community! Don’t be afraid to ask questions. People have great advice and are very helpful.
bipolar,f6rkxuj,t3_dsl9no,1573108040.0,Before my insurance runs out I get a 30 day supply of my vraylar. I can usually meet my $175 deductible by then and be ok. Meet my therapist every week and my pdoc once and my deductible is met. So if you have a low deductible like me then that’s an option.
bipolar,f6rk26x,t3_dst1w0,1573106985.0,If you have intent or a plan which sounds like you’re getting to that place they can have you put somewhere yes. Sometimes it’s better to just go and take a break from life. My therapist understands me though. I have suicidal thoughts and last week she sent me a picture of my safety plan. Well drunk me sends back a picture with a handful of maybe 30 Valium and said I can send pictures too. What will this do? She threatened me that day. She knows I lose everything if I have to miss work for an extended period of time. So she gave me a choice to call and talk to her within the next minute or she’s making a call and I go away for a while. So yes it’s their choice and it depends on your relationship with your therapist.
bipolar,f6rjkrk,t3_dsrmr4,1573106431.0,Uhh you probably shouldn’t just take lexapro when you have bipolar. This can put you into mania. I would stop the meds until you can get on proper ones. Even if you have to be put on a waitlist somewhere it’s better than just taking meds without supervision.
boas,f6c1xzl,t1_f6byrh3,1572781274.0,If they’re let’s say around 3 feet. A boa that isn’t powerfed will be about as strong as a ball python. A 3 foot boa is going to be kind of slim. A 3 foot ball python is going to be a little chunky guy. Now I’m not sure about BCC growth rate at that length but I cant imagine them being much bigger. From my experience the boa creeps up on the rat real slow and close and hits it. The ball python will just get in the s position and just hit it. I’ve owned 3 ball pythons and a BI. This is the experience from my snakes I’ve owned. Like I said though one of my ball pythons was and aggressive feeder. She just struck as soon as you opened her tub. Varies snake to snake but I don’t see them being much different until the boa outgrows the ball python.
boas,f6bji27,t3_dqxnc4,1572774517.0,Of course they are stronger than ball pythons it’s a bigger snake. My imperator doesn’t hit its rat any harder than a ball python. They do wrap around their prey tighter. There are other snakes out there stronger and hit harder than boas. BCC and BI aren’t that bad. Technically an anaconda is a boa so you have those. Commonly kept boas though are mostly docile. I’ve had a ball python that scared the crap out of me every time I fed her. Depends on the snake really.

BipolarReddit,f4z4anp,t3_dm8hro,1571894273.0,Nope you’re not the only one. I was having suicidal thoughts several times on a daily basis to where I wanted to act on them so they went away. They’re mostly gone now that I’m on the right medication. Intrusive thoughts have lowered a lot obsessive thoughts however worsened. My thoughts are so bad sometimes like a week ago was bad. I was convinced I didn’t lock my apartment so I sent my sister over to check at midnight and it was locked. My obsession is double checking things. It can be a pain in the ass sometimes but I’ll trade the obsession over the intrusive.
BipolarReddit,f4z3l4o,t1_f4z2d6v,1571893496.0,Antidepressants can cause mania. My pdoc put me on one because of my depression wasn’t getting better. I’ve been manic since.

BipolarReddit,f4pdfsy,t3_dlb43f,1571725098.0,My first ever therapist appointment I was major depressed. Took some convincing from people around me because I didn’t see anything wrong. You just have to take that leap and email/call a therapist. I know how tough it can be but you’re on the right track just making this post.
BipolarReddit,f4krj20,t3_dkyx63,1571656687.0,I’m going to tell you my way but do NOT do it. This is really unhealthy and could possibly lead to an attempt.  I put a handful of pills in my hand and think of reasons why to live. I think of loved ones and how my death would fuck them up. I also cut myself which again do NOT do it. You just have to find your own way to cope. My ways are awful but work for me. I also talk about it in therapy a lot. My therapist is cool with it as long as I don’t have a plan to actually do it. So I would say a good therapist is the best way. Just make sure you tell them you have no plan or intent.
BipolarReddit,f45m78p,t1_f44god0,1571383543.0,Sorry I didn’t mean anything bad by it. Just saying it would be extremely weird for it to work that fast. If it worked for you though you should definitely get with a doctor and try it again. It wouldn’t hurt anything.
BipolarReddit,f40rzas,t1_f400wrc,1571306390.0,I’m like you for 3 years I tried every medication. I’m finally on something that works. Although the latest change to pull me out of depression has made me manic. I’m starting to have psychotic features. It just takes time before things work or not. Lithium isn’t going to work that fast and that dosage. You’ll also have to have blood tests after every increase. It’s basically a placebo right now that had you feeling better.
BipolarReddit,f40dhwd,t3_ditduz,1571294994.0,"The best part of iop that helped me the most was group therapy. I too shifted my schedule so I wouldn’t have to miss work. You’re going to get out of it whatever you put into the program. Totally worth it in my opinion. We had classes, art therapy, and group therapy. My insurance covered the whole thing it is really expensive here. Like $1,000 a week expensive. I was in the program for 2 months and left a totally different person."
bipolar,f3ec3sv,t3_dgrx9a,1570868313.0,We are at a high rate for suicide. I’ve tried once and failed. I’ll probably never try again. I regret every moment of it now. While I can’t talk you out of it I just hope my experience can help you out. It’s just not worth it in the long run. I didn’t take enough pills or drink enough alcohol. When I woke up all I could think about was my loved ones. I should have probably went to a hospital. Anyways I hope my experience can help you out in some way. We’ve all been in that dark place and it will pass.
bipolar,f3ebfor,t3_dgri8n,1570867197.0,"I’m up to 400mg of lamictal and around 200 I felt hypomania. This last about a week then went away. I just got put on Wellbutrin 300mg extended release for depression and I’m starting to feel manic again. I personally am choosing not to tell my pdoc because I’ve been depressed so long and it feels good right now. To answer your question though lamictal is great if you get on the right dosage.

Also I get mixed states a lot and vraylar is absolutely amazing for that."
bipolar,f33lgvp,t1_f33fhy4,1570640685.0,Daylio is a good app to use and i'm pretty sure it's what most people use to keep track of their moods.
bipolar,f32f6bq,t3_df67vk,1570606113.0,To add a little bit to the great information you already have. Track your moods for sure during winter and spring. I usually go into depression during winter and in spring if I’m not careful I can end up manic. It’s going to take a while to find the right set of meds. I take lamictal too. 400mg a day. Valium for anxiety and to help sleep. Ambien on top of the Valium. Vraylar for an antipsychotic. Vraylar helps both depression and mania. It took forever to find a combination that worked for me. So don’t be disappointed when you’re first starting medication. Also lamictal made me hypomanic as my dose increased so watch for that. Once I hit around 200mg a day. I was definitely in hypomania for atlesst a week. Your pdoc will most likely try seroquel first I would suggest asking for a different med. I went from 155lb to 260 on seroquel. I’m finally losing weight again.
bipolar,f32dqzm,t3_dfc47f,1570603953.0,I can tell when it’s starting because I have extremely low self esteem. I start feeling like I’m the best thing in the world. I go on tinder looking for someone to have sex with. My sleep pretty much stops even taking ambien I can’t sleep. Doing 100 things all at once. I usually don’t catch it right away though. I usually email my pdoc when it starts. I have a variety of antipsychotics. Saphris is wonderful btw but tastes awful.
SuicideWatch,f32d1ex,t3_dfbt8w,1570602941.0,I’ve been where you are now. April 7th 2017 is a date I’ll never forget. That’s my first attempt. So far my only attempt and one of my biggest regrets now. A therapist and psychiatrist can do wonders. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 1. I ended up on the right cocktail of meds and life has been good ever since. I’m not saying this will fix you but it’s a start to getting better. I have no friends my family isn’t supportive of me. That’s ok now. My therapist has taught me to worry about me. Nobody else matters but me. Depression can be managed even though it might seem impossible. Please do not try this. I ended up lucky and slept for like a day and that was it.
cornsnakes,f2zqkdw,t3_deyron,1570535148.0,Bad news if she’s outside she’s most likely gone.
Borderlands,f2e09gp,t1_f2e07gd,1570173144.0,Nope I play Amara but good try.
BipolarReddit,f26i19o,t1_f267dcp,1570011393.0,Tried this once smoked weed instant panic attack. Never touched the stuff after that happened.
bipolar,f1b1za1,t3_d8gs5v,1569320014.0,If your seeing a regular doctor and not a psychiatrist or psychiatric nurse practitioner you need to change that. Certain anti depressant can trigger mania. Also if she’s taking a mood stabilizer on top of that her mood can be raised.  Is it lamictal that she’s taking? That trigger hypomania for me. I couldn’t imagine being in an ssri at the same time.  I take Prozac for my depression but I’m also on a high dose of an anti psychotic. High dose of lamictal.  Anyways she needs a hospital especially if she’s been awake that long. She will hate you for it in the moment but once reality sets back in she’ll understand.
bipolar,f16oydb,t3_d7qyy3,1569219011.0,Seasonal affective disorder the depression is about to hit hard and there’s nothing I can do about it. Also I stopped my antipsychotics once to try to go into mania never worked :(
borderlands3,f0linen,t3_d4npqc,1568719566.0,Is this from a side quest?
Diablo3Necromancers,ezzsrkt,t1_ezzqie5,1568292383.0,Zmonk in 2 mans is bad because you do not want to even be close to the mobs. You’re pretty much one shot if you’re hit at higher grs without land of the dead up. Yes you click elites with singularity. If anything even looks your way you’re dead. That’s why a znec is so good. It’s full on glass cannon build you kill it before it kills you pretty much.
Diablo3Necromancers,ezza089,t1_ezz19th,1568283308.0,90s are easy now you can just go in a public game as singularity or znec. That’s where I practiced my znec we were doing 100s in a public game. The main thing as a singularity nec is to click elites and not the whites around them.
Diablo3Necromancers,ezsxpy0,t1_ezsxkpk,1568114535.0,It’s one of the best build for lower group grs 120ish.  With just a zmonk you won’t live though. You really want a Znec and then just click elites and run.
Diablo3Necromancers,ezjbg9g,t3_d1974j,1567941916.0,"Ok so I’m sitting at 3.2 million damage right now. It’s pretty much kill stuff before you die. Pop simulacrum and land of the dead. Run past trash my mages just kill it without stopping. Hunt elites if you die you get cool down on your two buffs. At 105 this works.  Now to push higher it’s same thing but you use dayntees and a curse. Move slower. Certain mobs are going to just one shot you.

Edit: Also dont worry too much about guides. Check the leaderboards there are people who have done it without using a curse. If you get the right mob types its very easy. Wrong mobs and youre one shot theres really nothing you can do about that. You need as much cdr as possible more uptime on land of the dead and simulacrum is key to this build."
Diablo3Necromancers,ezcfahs,t1_ezce7qj,1567834226.0,Not sure how you play the build without devour considering it’s a main skill.
Diablo3Necromancers,ezccnid,t3_d0rvdj,1567833123.0,There is no correct setup. It’s whatever you’re comfortable with. Lost time isn’t a huge deal either you can use anything in that slot that rolls good. Its going to be a hard build to play on console. You’re best off building singularity mages on console.
Diablo3Necromancers,eyv7zw7,t3_cyzl4j,1567483590.0,Int to crit imo. Good find btw.
Diablo3Wizards,eybrq6v,t3_cwhots,1566990559.0,You only need around 55% cdr. Make your decision on that. I would keep it as is for now. This isn’t a bad roll. Just check your other gear see what your cdr is at. If your cdr is fine then roll cdr to attack speed.
boas,ex1s4cx,t3_cr4ggh,1565954466.0,So a glass tank isn’t ideal for a boa since they don’t hold humidity. Look into an animal plastics or boa phile cage. You can get these with a hole cut in the top. You can run a Che on a thermostat on one side with around 80 on the temperature. Run heat tape on the other side at about 90 on a thermostat. Now this will cost you some money. If you want a red tail boa this is your best bet. This is best for the snake and easiest for you to maintain. This is minimal effort at most if you want one of these animals. You’re looking at around $300 at least for the cage. Cheap thermostats which I don’t recommend is probably another $60. Best bet is a herpstat 2. This will run you another $200. Imo this is the very basic for heating and enclosure. Plus the price of snake. It’s a long term investment but well worth it. I keep an extra room in my apartment at 80 degrees that’s how I do my cool side. Heat tape in hot side. Hope this helps you out to realize what you’re getting into.
juggalo,ex1lmo7,t3_cr3z2p,1565949214.0,He must be doing good begging for money.
DiabloSwitch,ewek87d,t3_cnxje4,1565326740.0,It’s fine to die. You will die a lot in soft core since most builds are just straight damage . Hardcore is where you will feel bad to die.
bipolar,eupydgk,t3_ch5wox,1563966929.0,I started feeling manic when they raised my dose to 300mg. They added in two different antipsychotics saphris and vraylar for about 2 weeks. Now I’m on vraylar and boy is it awesome. It helps with mania and depression. I’ve never responded to any medication like this before. I’m finally hopeful I’ll have a stable mood.
boas,ettlc2f,t3_cdb0ql,1563186170.0,Vet trip isn’t necessary in my opinion. Let her settle for 2 more weeks then try again. If she’s 3 feet long she can go a while without eating. The best possible answer is she was fed too soon. Wait two weeks in between feedings. Do you know when she was fed last?

bipolar,etqrh72,t3_cd071u,1563099150.0,I just got high dose of Valium added to my meds a bit ago. Haven’t had the urge to drink since then.
Diablo,et8vxqw,t3_c9e0jx,1562572865.0,With everyones advice in this thread. Im proud to report ive hit GR 94 so far!!!
Diablo,et5io9x,t1_et3pi29,1562475360.0,So it’s just full on glass cannon kill or be killed type of thing.
Diablo,esydrim,t1_esybtxa,1562342271.0,Thank you this is very helpful.
Diablo,eswx2io,t1_eswvw0f,1562322090.0,I tried a thorns build first trying to replace those pieces. I like the singularity build better. I’m not lacking damage I’m being one shot by certain mobs. I’ll try to fix everything suggested though. Right now I was kinda like let’s just throw on an ancient.
boas,esnwrcg,t3_c8c8ud,1562153071.0,So you’re going to want a plastic tub to keep your snake in. Put the snake on paper towels. This stuff is safe to spray on the snake https://www.petco.com/shop/en/petcostore/product/reptile/reptile-health-and-wellness/natural-chemistry-reptile-spray spray your snake and let it sit for 30 minutes in the plastic tub. This stuff dries out mites. Clean the tub out really good. I use Clorox wipes to clean mine. Replace the paper towels. Spray the whole snake again. Wait another 30 minutes mites should be gone from snake. The enclosure you can use PAM like you are. I would replace all substrate in there. Again Clorox wipe it out. You should end up mite free.
boas,esbqgra,t1_esa483q,1561806698.0,Humidity as high as possible. Just make sure there is no condensation on the glass or whatever. Condensation means too much.
retics,erx6n2h,t3_c4lm9u,1561374526.0,I’m going to suggest a boa. If you get a female BCC it can get quite big but you’ll be able to handle it on your own. I wouldn’t want a burm or retic if there’s not going to be someone else around. Sure some are puppy dogs but like you say freak accidents can happen. It’s not worth it when it gets so big you can’t handle it on your own.
juggalo,erjot3t,t3_c2ezxg,1560940927.0,They finally going to come out the closet.
bipolar,eptk6hp,t1_eptjx86,1559491902.0,Nah I’m on 80mg latuda 5mg valiumx2 and 150mg lamictal I figured if I stop the latuda the lamictal and Valium might bring me up
DiabloSwitch,eopk6xi,t3_bsra7v,1558766599.0,On switch you have to go to your season journey to claim it. Then it goes into your inventory to be opened.
