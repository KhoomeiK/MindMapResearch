One of the reasons why we are polyamorous is because we know each connection to different people is unique and we shouldn't limit to just one romantic relationship and rather explore others as well. So if I were to compare my hubby's connection with my boyfriend's I'll only find differences. Is not like I can leave my hubby and run off to my boyfriend and start a new life with him, because that's not the type of connection I have with him.

But when you flip it, if the woman wants the kid but the man doesn't, is not his place to even think about suggesting an abortion, but be forced to parenthood or at the very least child support."
AmItheAsshole,fl9c7pg,t1_fl9avym,1584949140.0,"I don't agree with this. They did planned beforehand what should happen in case contraception fails. I get that pregnancy is the result of having sex but there was a sense of security when they agreed beforehand that if that should happen then abortion. The woman agreed beforehand about the choices in her body, the man agreed beforehand he didn't wanted to be a parent. And now because she backed down on the abortion he is forced to be a parent? When a couple agree to have a kid, when it finally happens, if the man changes his mind now he cannot force her to abort, right? Why it shouldn't be the same in the opposite side?

OP is NTA and all the stuff she's been saying make her sound like an AH"
