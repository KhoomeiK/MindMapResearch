AskReddit,fnafv1x,t1_fna4ny8,1586796775.0,"I know exactly what you’re talking about. I’m not an engineer but I am a woman who can do basic maintenance vehicle if I have the proper tools. My headlights went out and I changed the bulbs. But one light was still out. I changed the fuse and still one headlight out. So I did some research, and l learned that my headlights function like Christmas tree lights and I needed to change the housing that the lights connected into, which I wasn’t equipped to do. So I took it to a dealership service center. The dealership told me they needed to replace all my fuses and there were peanut bulbs that surrounded my actual headlights that needed to be replaced. All of which was a lie. So when I picked up the car, I paid and asked to speak to manager. Manger was too busy to speak to me. When I got home I saw that an unused oil filter was stolen out of my car. So I called and asked to speak to the manager again. Still got no response from the manager. I just called the credit card company and explained that they charged me for services they never performed and got my money back. If they would have just been honest with me about what the problem was, I would have happily paid and went on my way. But they lied, got caught and stole and got caught. SMH"

I personally think he continues his pattern of trying to please people, with her. I have been firm with boundaries and sticking up for myself. That’s part of why he went off. I was telling him couldn’t speak to me the way he was. Me sticking up for myself makes he more angry.  He is not living here because I went to the police last week.

I can’t say how it would fly. You can only decide if it’s the right decision for you to share it with her. Remember that people who have gone through what your wife has have a hard time being able to love someone else. I had to learn this the hard way with my husband. I kept trying to show him I could help him heal and be there to support him. That’s not how he wanted to heal. He became more distant and more angry toward me until things got too toxic. Try reading “Allies in Healing” by Laura Davis. This helped me understand what was happening."

I’ve had some therapists that I think were really bad, some just inexperienced, and some that I felt didn’t have the best intentions. I have one now that I think is exactly what I need right now. As we change and grow so do the needs we have for therapy. So that might mean we need to change therapy. I also find that giving your therapist feedback is important. That way they know if they’re giving you what you need, they might change their approach for the better if you tell them how you feel like the process is going."

It must be so difficult to only have your therapist to confide in. Can she recommend any support groups for you? Finding a community with other people who have a similar experience can be very helpful. From my own experiences, choose carefully which of your friends you choose to disclose to. If/when you chose to. Don’t just open up when you feel most vulnerable or desperate to just talk to someone about it. It’s a heavy load for you to carry alone, but it’s also a heavy load for the person you share it with. When I began disclosing my experiences with friends, I really saw who my true friends were. Take care of yourself and your daughters. I hope you all find peace."

Was the rape reported? Hopefully your nieces will also want to live with you. Have you talked to V1 about what happened to her and how important therapy is for her? Is V2 in therapy? She’s also a secondary survivor and would probably be helpful for her. If your family gives you issues about them coming to live with you, I would say get CPS involved."

For me, distancing is the hardest for me to cope with. Before my SO came out about the trauma we were together for 7 years. We were very close and spent a lot of time together— we did most everything together. 
I first started with therapy. I learned that I need to be okay with doing things alone that we used to do together. I started small, I went to the beach or movies alone, and if SO was up to it he could join too. Then I ended up going on vacation alone (initially planned together) and later I went to Thanksgiving alone. It was process for me to get comfortable with doing these activities alone. 
Now, I’m coping by trying to make more/new friends. This isn’t easy for a person my age because most of my peers are busy with their families now. I ended with becoming closer friends with someone more than twice my age. It’s really a great friendship for me because she has so much experience in life and with relationships. She’s become a great confidant and I’m so lucky to have her. 
I also try to use my extra time for a new hobby and to exercise. Exercise is great because it burns out a lot of my anger, but it also makes me cry. So, I tend to exercise alone but for some this is a great group activity. 
What I can say, is that it’s important to have a non-judgmental support group. People who you trust to be honest with about what you’re going through. People who won’t judge if you stay or if you go. People who will listen to hard stuff and help you to not dwell on it. Most importantly, people who can help you accept your circumstances and move on from the pain (doesn’t necessarily mean moving on from the relationship). You just don’t want to wallow in your misery, that can cause depression.  This type of honesty, will show you who your closest people are. You’ll learn a lot about the existing relationships you have. You might be surprised at the people who can handle this challenge and those who can’t. 
INMHO, you are still very young. These early adult years are a wonderful time for you to connect with people, have fun and start your personal journey conquering your dreams. My heart breaks for you. I hope you make time for yourself to have fun and focus on your dreams right now. You might find that you become so busy that you only have time for your girlfriend 1x a month. You might also find that you want something more out of a romantic relationship. It might give her the time and space she needs to become the girlfriend you want. Only time will tell and only time will heal. So take this time for you to focus on the person you want to be, and see what happens with the girlfriend. Please remember, her healing process is hers alone. You can always support her regardless of your relationship status. But it’s her healing journey, you can’t speed it up or change it. You can only decide if you can be a part of it or not. 
I know this is a long reply and it might not be easy, but I hope I helped."
secondary_survivors,fak3rkz,t3_e9ihxe,1576160336.0,"I have a partner with cPTSD. Distancing is a part of the relationship. It’s not easy and does add strain to the relationship, but it’s a part it. Have you told her that you want to see her more? Ask yourself if you’re okay with only seeing her once a month if that’s all the time she’ll give you. If you need more, tell her that. If she can’t give you want you need, then you need to decide if you can be in the relationship. Unfortunately being in a relationship with a trauma survivor can be inconsistent or unstable, although there will be times that seem normal and great. It’s okay if you can’t continue, and it’s okay if do. But you need to do what’s best for you. It sounds like she’s trying to what best for her by focusing on her degree, working and trying to heal. You have to respect that, but it’s okay for you to explain what your needs are too."

Maybe start a new hobby or get back into one? Find a cause you want to volunteer with. It’s good to have activities that you can enjoy on your own or with friends. Have a support group of people you love and trusts helps too. 
Please remember you cannot heal this person. Although your love can be helpful and comforting, she has to take the healing journey on her own."
secondary_survivors,f9qlo8m,t1_f8qwlvd,1575563211.0,I agree with all of this. But I’d like to add that you two can also go to therapy together to find ways to overcome these obstacles. Also know that choosing to be with a person who is healing from trauma can be a rollercoaster. Things like this will continue to happen. Healing is a journey and you have to be willing to endure the ebbs and flows. So make sure you’re ready for that if you decide to go through with the marriage. You should also find a therapist and/or group for yourself. It will help you to understand some of the hardships to expect.

Just your sister knowing she has you advocating for her will do a lot in her healing process. Remember the healing process is not fast or linear.
