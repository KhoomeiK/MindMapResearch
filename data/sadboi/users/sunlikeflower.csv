SuicideWatch,fmpw1f5,t3_fwpgsj,1586288374.0,"Hi, being ugly is relative. I really liked the [Eye of the Beholder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_the_Beholder_(The_Twilight_Zone,_1959)) episode of Twilight Zone. It would be great if you could watch it. It would also distract you for a little while.

I understand that we are not living in that world. But you have us. The whole internet of people who care about you and don't care how you look.

I think that most people tend to agree on what's pretty or ugly based on what is considered normal or usual. In some cultures, for example, [girls are force-fed](https://youtu.be/ZM2q7XFOOgg) to look cute because thin people are considered poor and ugly.

I hope this helps a little."

I just thought that I'm not good enough to fight and never asked for help again (I mean help with suicidal thoughts, etc). I didn't attempt to commit suicide, well, at least yet. But later in life this worldview didn't help at all. Every time I felt sad/anxious/suicidal/etc. I thought that I should just fight or die, and if I tell someone I'll just admit that I'm weak. I still think that way."

SuicideWatch,fkykt6w,t3_fldvtv,1584650718.0,"Paroxetine takes a couple of weeks to start working. During those couple of weeks it may increase the risk of suicide.
