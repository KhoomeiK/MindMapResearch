literature,f0nhr3f,t3_d2sa0w,1568770419.0,"I just finished reading Kafka's ""Metamorphosis"". I found it extremely intriguing! I researched some about him for my literary class and I found that helped me understand his works much more. 

What really perplexes me is how Gregor wakes up and almost brushes off the fact he is an insect. The first thing he thinks about is work, which I think pays tribute to Kafka's issues with authority.  

I think the third part is really the most impactful, however. To see his family slowly lose any sense of him being a human is extremely sad. Especially when they start referring to Gregor as ""it"". And the way he died, and how he was disposed of after he died was so lonely, I was expericing those emotions to a degree.  The fact that Kafka and evoke such emotion out of people is amazing. 

One last point, it's well known Kafka's father was extremely psychologically abusive towards him. At the beginning of the story, his sister and mother both try to treat him with at least a little bit of decency, but his father shooed him back into his room, and later on hit him, without thinking anything of it. It's obvious Kafka was using his experiences with his father to shape Mr. Samsa. 

I can't WAIT to read more Kafka works."
