WomensHealth,fonn1pq,t3_g86h2z,1587922625.0,To be honest hun . It sounds more like hormones than pregnancy..for me this month i had spotting 6 days after ovulation for a day..then it stopped and now i am 4 days late for my period..that sort of thing is more to watch out for..and im very freaked out as well..though im 35 and have 3 kids already...i get its stressful having a lighter period..or it throws you a curve ball and turns up early and such..don't panic too much..wait for your next one and im sure it will be back to normal once again üòÅcould be hormones (or lack of one of them.. estrogen or progesterone) or could be stress..

WomensHealth,fjmwe4x,t3_fe9069,1583487317.0,As a woman who has been to many many smears i can tell you there is nothing to worry about..they lay you down..tell you to open your legs like touch your feet with knees apart..then they put a speculum in with lube on it..this feels odd at first and they will open it up inside you..this doesn't hurt but can feel abit uncomfortable..after that all they will do is take a look inside at your cervix and take a little sweeping brush on a stick or swab and gently rub your cervix with it..all this feels like is something lightly touching your cervix..after that they will close the speculum and slide it out and tell you its all done..some women will spot little afterwards but thats normal..other than that you will be free to continue your life as you have been.. i will say though if you are sexually active they say do not have sex for 2 days before.no douching or lube or creams as this can mess with the results üòÅ hope this puts your mind at ease..its a real breeze compared to colposcopy and biopsy up there and smears only have mild discomfort for a fleeting moment or 2

WomensHealth,fhxvdug,t1_fhxpue9,1581963098.0,"I was actually shocked as my paps always come back normal..had one 8 months ago..so not sure how it missed it.. low grade CIN isn't really much to worry about..it clears up on its own after a year or so 80% of the time..its when it doesn't go away and progresses to CIN 2 or 3..then they need to cut out the abnormal cells before they progress to final stage..

Symptoms i have are postcoital bleeding 40% of the time and spotting around ovulation..that and a heavy feeling in the pelvis on n off..feels abut like a uti sort of but when tested it shows no infection.. not lots of symptoms to go on...i still have them on n off

First i was told use lube incase it was dryness that was causing issues..if it doesn't work go for colposcopy..i ended up having the colposcopy lol.was the only way they spotted abnormalities when spraying vinegar liquid on my cervix..after spotting it they took a biopsy to be absolutely sure of what they were seeing...using lube did cut the postcoital bleeding down as it was every single time..which is unheard of for me personally...

always best to get it checked out though..even if its just dryness thats the issueüòÅ"

Healthyhooha,fhtwipn,t3_f328cy,1581879146.0,"I had mine 3 days ago..
To be honest it was damn scary..the colposcopy itself was no real deal but the punch biopsy hurt and the silver nitrate stick they used after hurt as much (may just be my experience)..my obgyn didn't tell me anything that was happening as it went along and i was shaking..
When over i felt very faint ..even after i left i almost fainted outside the hospital as well..
I had bad cramping to go with it..

I was told no sex or tampons..no baths (showers only) and nothing inside the vagina for 7 days..i only had 1 biopsy taken as they said it looks like i have low grade CIN..
After i experienced brown dirt looking discharge/ blood (slightly spotted) day 2 i had a grey bit of what looked like skin fall out..it was alien looking and im really not sure what it was..was no blood with it at all..just flappy gray whitish skin ...day 3 i seem to be doing nothing at all..my cervix feels angry though and when i need a poop i feel tender. Like a heavy feeling in my cervix..that and when i sit down briefly it feels the same..haven't seen any scabs come out as of yet so thats something to look forward to if it happens LOL...
Not really much bleeding though so i may just be lucky..
