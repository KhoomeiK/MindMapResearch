pugs,fot5gjp,t1_fot5cg2,1588045075.0,He drinks from plastic but eats from metal so it might be that!
aww,fmfhz36,t3_fuzev4,1586027635.0,"She's such a cutie!!!! Fiona, Charlie, Ellie (that's my name), Maggie"
pugs,fhc2kqo,t1_fhaei61,1581454928.0,I hope so he still such a puppy at heart all he wants to do is play with his sisters!
pugs,fhc2gu4,t1_fha90x1,1581454866.0,Oh I will! I felt so bad for him last night he didn‚Äôt seem to know how to eat with the cone so I hand fed him his wet dog food lol. I‚Äôd do anything for his sweet soul.
pugs,fh9uexy,t1_fh9sc87,1581389846.0,Oh my gosh they do look alike!! So cute! üíïüíï
pugs,fh9622f,t1_fh95wlp,1581373983.0,It made me so nervous with him being a pug! Best of luck I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll do great üòä
pugs,ffa4pua,t3_esglf9,1579727839.0,I love this üíú
pugs,fcuvc2o,t3_eixt53,1577989288.0,Ahhh!! Such a cutie! I have a Minnie too but she is fawn! ü•∞
pugs,fcm9cy3,t1_fcm2i9q,1577767760.0,Thank you! I agree I thinks it‚Äôs too early. And yes we want to keep them in the family. The mamma is baby so I‚Äôm going to keep one for sure Bc she is so special I know her babies will be! But my sister and brother want the other two as well!
pugs,fclq0fw,t1_fclpns7,1577753669.0,Yes that‚Äôs true I think they all have lightened up since they were born. I guess it‚Äôs a waiting game to see. They all have unique things about them which I love. One of the fawn ones was actually born with a pink nose but it went away! One of the fawns also has pink and black paw pads. It could all change though as they grow though.
pugs,fclpitz,t1_fclpcgy,1577753331.0,It‚Äôs okay. I don‚Äôt want to sound like I like her anymore than the other two. I just wanted to know if people thought she was a silver pug.
pugs,fclpb0k,t1_fclp11p,1577753179.0,"They are all ours I‚Äôm not sure what you mean. Just thinks it‚Äôs cool that one may be a silver pug. I still love them all obviously. They can‚Äôt play yet anyways they are 3 weeks old they are still with their momma a lot, which is important."
Psoriasis,fb99678,t1_fb98hfj,1576632594.0,"Yes! You can get it on amazon! Biolage Scalpsync Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, 33.8 Fl Oz https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002DYCUW2/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_Uay-Db5B0RZKD


They have 2 different kinds so make sure you get this kind! It is pricey for shampoo but it‚Äôs totally worth it and each bottle typically lasts me 6 months. I would say it took at least four months for the plaque psoriasis to go away so it takes time! I know everyone‚Äôs psoriasis is different so hopefully this helps!!"
Psoriasis,fb8ks91,t3_ebyylt,1576616053.0,"I had super bad plaque psoriasis in my scalp for two years. I still have it but it‚Äôs not plaque anymore at all. I swear by Matrix scalpsync shampoo they have conditioner as well. I started using it because my hair salon lady told me about it. After a year of using it, it has helped tremendously. I still have psoriasis but my scalp is not constantly in pain and itching 24/7 it‚Äôs finally bearable. I would recommend trying it, it did take awhile for it to help though!"
pugs,fah1xxo,t3_e8kwfp,1576077271.0,Oh my god this is possibly the best picture I‚Äôve ever seen

relationship_advice,fa7sjkp,t3_e7z2tt,1575837770.0,I don‚Äôt think it would come off as weird at all! I think she would really appreciate it. It‚Äôs always nice to feel like someone is there for them or someone to recognize how hard they working through really rough times. I think it sounds really sweet. You should do it
pugs,f9qqi6f,t1_f9prjy7,1575565380.0,Thank you üòä

braces,f7i9w89,t1_f7hyohr,1573755645.0,Oh wow that‚Äôs crazy! I think a lot of people think that braces are for straightening teeth and that‚Äôs it but that‚Äôs definitely not the case!
braces,f7hwvqj,t1_f7hvugk,1573748958.0,Thank you! I actually had them in first grade to third grade! It was really just to make my mouth bigger because it was super small. But I‚Äôve always hated my teeth since like age 12 and have always seen flaws in them and people always say ‚Äúthey look fine to me‚Äù but when you are the one looking at them in the mirror every day you can see the flaws. I totally agree with you a big reason I wanted them were for little changes but I also had to get them for that back molar.
survivor,f7ger4j,t1_f7gem6q,1573701829.0,I know!!! Actually insane that she took it that far and felt entitled like it was a ‚Äújoke‚Äù when obviously she had to know it wasn‚Äôt a joke to Kellee since she was crying about it.
braces,f7ft984,t1_f7fszj3,1573686214.0,Haha my bottom teeth are crooked. And my bite is off on one side my back molars don‚Äôt touch. I also had a molar removed and the molar behind it started to fall over so I have to have it moved upright so I can get the implant. My two front teeth are also not how I like them one sits forward.
pugs,f7c44ph,t3_dvcjqs,1573583987.0,oh my god he is such a cutie
braces,f6tz41k,t1_f6skqve,1573155987.0,I feel you no worries it gets better. I‚Äôve had braces for a week now I they hurt so much less than the spacers!
Psoriasis,f6tyx5d,t1_f6sxvzs,1573155917.0,What kind of tar shampoo do you use?
braces,f6o13cd,t3_ds4p0m,1573005123.0,I got mine 6 days ago and they still hurt to chew I‚Äôm not sure what to do either üò≠

AnimalsBeingJerks,f6jlipd,t3_drhy3q,1572896533.0,Me trying to make friends
aww,f6im72e,t1_f6ikp5z,1572880815.0,"Close enough, right? Lol"
relationship_advice,f5ugd7y,t1_f5tlwvj,1572472807.0,You‚Äôre welcome! And you aren‚Äôt being melodramatic! Unfortunately for some people however don‚Äôt believe in depression or don‚Äôt understand how horrible of a disorder depression is. You should really sit down with them and just explain I‚Äôve done that with a few friends and they have been so understanding! I completely understand I hate getting close to people because all of my negative thoughts and being so sensitive. If I were you I would concentrate on the relationships you have now and open up to them. While you get better and are not as depressed looking to build other relationships then may help you. I really hope the best for you! You‚Äôre doing great! Be proud of how far you have come and never give up! I‚Äôm so sorry you are struggling.
relationship_advice,f5tl1k1,t3_dpapc5,1572460708.0,You should try explain to your friends that this is part of having a mental illness. They should be understanding and comforting. I bail on friends all the time because of my anxiety and depression. It‚Äôs hard for people to understand but if they really care for you and love you they will stand by you and help you through your healing process even if you can‚Äôt be present. I‚Äôve struggled with the same thing and that is why I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends.
braces,f5koxql,t1_f5jw1up,1572267617.0,That‚Äôs so good to hear I hope that‚Äôs how it is with me!
braces,f5kougu,t1_f5jv1am,1572267573.0,Since Wednesday! I actually just woke up this morning and they don‚Äôt hurt as nearly as bad.
AnxiousAttachment,evqa4pt,t1_evqa20b,1564689449.0,Thank you! That‚Äôs really encouraging to hear!
Anxiety,etudyrw,t3_cdeova,1563210407.0,love this. thank you.
Anxietyhelp,ettq9ay,t1_etn1jep,1563192319.0,"Sorry for the late response! I understand, that is how I was with my family I fought with them all the time. Now that I‚Äôve moved out I get along with my sister and my mom a lot more. Just wait it out that should get better."
Anxietyhelp,etmaq0m,t1_etl30tf,1562955748.0,I agree it‚Äôs so hard to break such a bad behavioral habit. Now that I know though I hope I can get to the point where I can at least control it or have secure attachment.
Anxietyhelp,etmaimm,t1_etma9s0,1562955620.0,Me as well! I had no idea it was a thing. I googled it last night it was disheartening to see so many people lose relationships to the attachment style. It scares the shit out of me. I‚Äôm glad you saw this though so now you know as well!
Anxietyhelp,etl1xc4,t1_etl1tte,1562917532.0,Therapy is definitely something I need to start immediately. Thank you for your help it means a lot!
Anxietyhelp,etl1o39,t1_etl1cyd,1562917202.0,Wow... I think you are right. It‚Äôs sounds 100% like me. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm worried about as well I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôs going to get sick of it and leave.. which would be understandable. Have you gotten any help for it?
Anxietyhelp,etkw99j,t1_etkw22m,1562911005.0,I will definitely look into it! I have depression as well so that may be a factor. I met someone who does massages for anxiety I may try that.
