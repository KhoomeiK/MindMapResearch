army,fee6mbu,t3_eoojfr,1579027476.0,That needs to be upgraded! Nice job
Crunchyroll,fdpiu3k,t3_emitva,1578629789.0,CrunchyRolls site is a little screwy....check out VRV which is powered by them and a much better site.
MurderedByWords,fd6bjqq,t3_ek4mky,1578188460.0,When you put it that way it’s actually really sad...it is way to descriptive
Anxiety,fd6a2bu,t3_ek2smc,1578187820.0,I’ll go back into the military if they called me. I do not think that world war 3 would happen. No one wants it to happen...people enjoy sitting at their computers or playing on their phones to much to bother!
MurderedByWords,fd69s8l,t3_ek4mky,1578187702.0,Pretty well thought out....he must get destroyed a lot because there is no way that’s his first time sending that lol
Crunchyroll,fd0p90e,t1_fd0aw1g,1578121917.0,I like fantasy/horror....any suggestions?
army,fcyc8c8,t3_eje5hk,1578077901.0,Sometimes you just need a helping hand!
Wellthatsucks,fcyc6v4,t3_ejhslk,1578077879.0,I’m sorry!
depression,fcnuasl,t3_ei19sk,1577818556.0,"I might be staying home as well! There is nothing wrong with it....sometime I don’t feel like being dragged out to a drunken fest haha sometimes I value my time and sleep more than I value time with friends and family no matter how selfish that might seem. We all live a life and walk the path alone. No once an walk a mile in our shoes and we make decisions based on our reality and experiences. If your choosing to spend it alone the enjoy it...if you have the chance to go out and are choosing not to die to anxiety and depression, thenI would ask you to get up and shower, call your friends and go out. You’ll be much happier if that actually what you want to do."
horror,fc9r5lk,t3_egt7lo,1577556964.0,True story!
depression,fbthwpt,t3_ebqokn,1577079481.0,Thanks for taking the time to read it....haunts me everyday and I’ll never be able to look back on those 6 years of my life with pride even though they make me the proudest. Thanks for replying brotha!
depression,fb5z556,t3_e1zc9s,1576537419.0,"It’s not rude brotha it’s how you feel and that’s ok. Sounds like you may have some toxic people in your life...remove them and see if that doesn’t help. Like I said I feel the same way most days but I choose to believe that there has to be more than just this bullshit. Leave that shit behind and go out and do something you’ve never done before. Stop focusing on the negative and look at the positive. You don’t have to sit in your room and feel bad for yourself....go out and just do something, anything. What do you like to do? What’s your outlet....me I like to escape the world and play video games and or watch and interact with people on Twitch or Mixer which are gaming platforms."
Anxiety,faws90i,t3_ean7bu,1576374880.0,Your welcome....keep it up! It’s never easy but we can choose to push through and maximize our potential!
Anxiety,fawkif0,t3_ean7bu,1576372544.0,Congratulations!!!
iamatotalpieceofshit,fam981a,t3_e9qnzw,1576198619.0,How much of a piece of shit do you have to be to use a 16 year old girl who has done nothing to further your political agenda!!!
depression,faixggj,t3_e9dw26,1576118952.0,Let it out....I’m proud! Feel better now?
depression,faivofs,t3_e97egy,1576117718.0,Survival of the fittest.... life is literally crazy and unfathomable...nobody knows how we got here or why and especially what happens after we are gone. All we can do is the best we can until the inevitable. I think about death a lot and have had suicidal tendencies and still do. I wake up every day wondering why and how but continue to push on anyways. I don’t even know what I’m saying now except I’m lying in bed watching extinct or alive when I could be out enjoying life to the fullest but I have work in the morning........
depression,f9vr2a7,t3_e714ei,1575677461.0,I’m sorry for your loss...don’t worry you’ll meet again at the big concert in the sky! Stay strong
ptsd,f9vqys9,t3_e70i6w,1575677388.0,There is nothing wrong with expressing yourself....I’m glad that you did because I feel the same way you do most of the time...I feel that I have to wear so many faces it’s exhausting....keep up the good fight because we are all in it together and will stand by you
Anxiety,f9vqqaq,t3_e734oh,1575677209.0,Good for you! You stuck up for yourself and you should feel proud...I’m happy for you
depression,f9fegex,t3_e1zc9s,1575268457.0,I got you....had one of those days today!!!! I honestly just want to see what happens next...hope always trumps fear!
depression,f8wkv50,t3_cml6ni,1574893134.0,Thanks for checking in and yea i know but the VA isn’t always the easiest to work with...thankfully I have some good friends
depression,f8tdc0p,t3_e1zc9s,1574801018.0,I feel this way most days....but you have to realize that there are people out there that love and care about you and also rely on you...keeps me from driving into a pole everyday
depression,f8my30m,t3_cml6ni,1574636649.0,"Hi Everyone,

I love with severe depression and anxiety and mood PTSD. I am 33 years old with a wife and two kids. On a daily basis I feel that I am a constant failure to everyone around me. I have a great job and perform extremely well. I am currently ranked #7 in the country for what I do and it’s pretty impressive yet I feel miserable day in and day out. I have told my family in the past that I was suicidal and still feel the same way sometimes. No matter how well I do or how hard Intry I feel that I am a complete failure. 

I use to be in the army and in great shape and ever since I left I have gained weight which I hate. I have why you would call a dad bod. People tell me to hit the gym it’ll help but the injuries I sustained while service cause me pain on a daily basis which makes it difficult to lift weights or even do light cardio. I need to get this off my chest because lately I have been long worse than ever. I block out my family and tell my kids I don’t feel like playing on a daily basis. I work Monday through Friday and make decent money that supports my family and on the weekends I am a slug and barely want to get off the couch. I have lost the urge to do the things I love most like watching movies, playing games, going out or even talking to my friends even though I have very few of those of any at all. I have plenty of people on my life that love and support me and yet I feel alone on a daily basis.

I am in a dark whole and the edge seems to far away for me to pull myself out. This is my first post and don’t even know if I’m doing this right. I feel a storm coming and that rain will fill my whole and I will drowned leaving everything behind including the people that rely on me the most. I am over whelmed with life and it’s not getting easier. I may be 33 but I find some comfort watching streamers on twictch as I use to be a major gamer. 

I don’t want anyone to worry about me even though they should. Please know that I am doing everything in my power to fight the demons inside. They scratch and they pull and I fight and fight but I’m getting tired. 

I have no one to talk to as I do not want them to worry about me but I need to reach out......"
