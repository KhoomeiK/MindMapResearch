raisedbynarcissists,fqnvsu0,t1_fqnvha0,1589502390.0,"Yep I relate 100% surprisingly mine has friends, lol"
raisedbynarcissists,fqnummr,t1_fqnubyr,1589501719.0,Yes! Exactly. She likes the sympathy and attention from her friends. Did you also have the experience where the nparent is so kind and helpful to their friends but then treat you really nasty? Like there was one time my nparent actually said that her friends treat her better than us (my siblings and I) and i was confused because I thought they should put their family first no matter what.
raisedbynarcissists,fqntwsp,t3_ga3h2s,1589501323.0,"When my nparent is on the phone, they love telling people how much work me and my brother are. How they constantly have to cook and clean and that we never leave her alone. It’s annoying. She dramatizes everything, we really don’t ask for things that often. I think she wants to make her life sounds interesting since there is nothing else going on. They want it to make it seem like we’re preventing them from living a peaceful life. They also love reality shows, especially wedding shows. It’s atrocious."
socialanxiety,fqntl9b,t1_fqntcak,1589501146.0,"Yes!! I feel like that store scams me often actually.. they always change their prices, for example one day I’ll buy a bagel for a dollar and the next day it’s $1.75.. depending on who the cashier is. I have to stop going there. And the item I was talking about clearly said .99 and if it’s not, they shouldn’t have the sticker there IMO."
AskReddit,fqntbeb,t3_gjn5vc,1589501002.0,"“I feel like..” 

people use it to express their opinion on something. “I feel like you would look good in this shirt” or “I feel like you would enjoy this show” it sounds so annoying and when paired with the valley girl accent or uptalk it’s like nails on a chalkboard. When anyone says it, it’s annoying. Also I haven’t heard this expression ever used before the last 2 years IMO and I don’t know where it came from. Make it stop."

BadMUAs,fqccy0z,t3_ghu5nn,1589255206.0,"The main things wrong are her eyebrows are too big and she’s wearing waaay too much highlight. Besides that, her skin is appears to be really nice, maybe a lil less coverage perhaps, and her eyes are nice, just the highlight and the brows look off. She doesn’t need that much makeup- less would really be more in this scenario"

The best way to look at it is that at university, make sure you study what interests you, so you’ll be doing something you enjoy. You’ll start to care less about what other people are doing. You don’t have to know exactly what job you want, sometimes you can’t plan things like that, it’ll find you when you spend some time exploring your options. You should be proud! Good luck! You don’t have to fear failure, because if you’re doing what you truly enjoy, that’s all that matters."
