Everything grows trough work and rest. Take your muscles for instance. You do alot of work and if you rest they grow. If you do not rest, well... you just fuck yourself up.

Same with evolution. If one were to live forever evolution would not be a thing. We'd all still be hydrogen atoms haha. (If you believe in that sort of origin)  You need to die in order to grow. You need to rest in order to grow. Ying yang. 

If a tree that is used to summer and winter suddenly only has winter, it will die. It is used to working hard to survive. And resting eating and growing. You my friend are human and believe it or not. We need alot of mental and physical rest.

Doing nothing is doing something. 

Could be that i am just muttering nonsence as i am just one soul that does not understand himself or others trough and trough. I wish to share the ying yang aspect i use to see the world trough (not in every situation as that is kind of hard in western lifestyle) it really helps me in my periods of depression to see the ""big truth"" as one might call it. Or ""the tao""  / the way. 

No matter what the fuck happens. Everything is nature and you are nature. So what have you to worry? The lifeform that survives the hardest battles grows the strongest. The lifeform that struggles and dies becouse it was too much. Will not reproduce and will not grow/evolve. So if one were to work too hard. One will damage the mind and will not grow/evolve. 

How do you choose to grow? Too little rest? Too much rest? No rest? 

Ying yang. Dark now, sun later.

A dead body now > a juicy apple later. Bad things now do not guarantee negativity after.

I'd personally say you need to be off of meds for  a week or two. But that is a guess based upon personal opinion.

""Trazodone is chemically unrelated to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors). It is chemically related to nefazodone (Serzone) and shares its actions.""

Using DMT while taking antidepressants, especially monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), can result in a serious condition called serotonin syndrome.

Serotonin syndrome signs

Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include:

confusion and disorientation

anxiety

irritability

shivering

tremors

muscle spasms

muscle rigidity

Some fast research

Your trazodone is ssri
You definetly need to stop taking ssri's before taking psychedelics 

How long do I have to wait after stopping an antidepressant before a psychedelic will have an effect?

It is unknown the exact amount of time it takes and is probably dependent on the antidepressant used, the time it was used for, and perhaps the dose taken. The good news is that it’s probably not a long period of time. This is evidenced by existing trials of MDMA and psilocybin-assisted psychotherapies. Some of the clinical trials of MDMA and psilocybin enrolled persons with refractory illness, which was defined by trying and failing at least two antidepressants in the past. Persons taking antidepressants were required to taper and discontinue antidepressants for 5 half-lives (generally accepted time-frame for total elimination of drug from the body) plus an extra week to demonstrate stability. For most antidepressants this equates to discontinuation approximately two weeks prior to psychedelic use [17-20]. The table in this article has a list of times it takes to eliminate antidepressants from the body.

The nature we as a species were born into was a very carefully orchestrated structure of survival of the fittest. Whilst nature knows how to balance itself... we do not understand nature. It is to complex to try and guess the reaction to your actions long term.

We started as hydrogen atoms and trough nuclear fusion other atoms appeared and trough this evolution/level up we are born. So we are simply what happens in nature our consiousness is just what happens with this set of atom building blocks (our human body and envirement) so what you choose to focus on in this life is a small percentage in your level up. Say you go for physical strenght your whole life you spend your level up point on +1 strenght in evolution.

This is the way we evolved and also trough natural selection only the ones that chose and succeeded in surviving by either running or dominating the other set of atom building blocks.  So yes you are everything and everything is you, if i were to deconstruct you back to how far we know that molecules and atoms can go you are hydrogen or whatever molecule came first.

That said if you in this life choose to not create suffering you can only hope the next you (when the body has decomposted and has arisen once again to live on this earth (or maybe our new space station, everything is possible (-;    ) will also be kind to others. If you now in this life choose to not create suffering you will feel less suffering in the next one.

Drugs,fcrw99x,t3_eiintf,1577907485.0,"I think of it like this: there is no good or bad only yes or no.

And some groups put a few rules in place that say you are bad.  You can only truly feel bad if you accept their rules as truths.

Even murder is only bad if you accept it as bad. You make your own beliefs. Its so damn hard to follow your own beliefs tho when you are forced to push all those rules inside of yourself and follow them."

spirituality,fc0hs6s,t3_efi1qg,1577291131.0,"I personally feel like everything we ""like"" is something we conditioned ourselves to like.

There are no wrong choices. When one feels like they found it! That means they stopped searching for ""it"" and only focus on now."
trippy,fc0hn8g,t3_effxtn,1577291046.0,How??? How do you do this?
spirituality,fc0ffjx,t1_fc0e7uh,1577289471.0,"Aah yes, but from personal experience i notice that i have 2 kinds of focus:  the focus that i want. So i am focussed becouse i am intrested or the focus that is enforced, the focus one learns in school. You must! And that makes me feel bad. Now i conditioned myself to feel a must with alot of parts of my life. Now i am trying to unlearn certain perceptions and opinions about how i should life live. 

It is so hard to analyse yourself when you think you are right. And when someone tries to help and tells one what kind of behaviour they should analyse more one gets irritated and angry. Myself included. But meditation helps me let go of following my own biased perception, it kind off helps me take the filters off. 

That a human is lazy and deluded might be what you conditioned yourself to ""know"" of humans. 

What a human is is evolved from past humans so what you train yourself to naturally be is put into the formula of evolving.  So how do you plan to evolve the new generations? That is life's question in my opinion.

Edit: every word is from personal opinion if anyone disagrees: i aint no expert yo :)"
spirituality,fc0e13q,t1_fc0ds3m,1577288252.0,"I notice that when i try to achieve something that it works against me haha.

When i try to not try the trying to do anything happens of itself.

Trying to make focus makes me lose my focus.
Just focussing on something works wonders for me.

If i see a future and try to follow that it does not work.
And if i work in the now things flow automaticly.
I just notice that my natural state of being is: stress and thinking of future and past."
spirituality,fc0aul9,t3_efatkk,1577285331.0,"I notice that when i let things go and follow the flow i get into a mindset that i labeled not trying/iditiotic and just wrong.

But i notice that things might go worse at first things go so much smoother after a little while.

I just don't follow my flow becouse others have made me interpret that as wrong.

Being dreamy / not being serious all the time feels wrong.

Yes it is my fault that i interpret myself as wrong but i feel that western philosophy and the western mindset/idiology is set in a way that forces this closed off mindset and pushes one's own opinions down and follows the herd. 

I really noticed this that when i bring my voice out and speak my mind that i get thrown out of the tribe directly. Suddenly everyone is against you. YOU MUST FOLLOW THE HERD OR FUCK YOU. I really pity the people stuck in the loop of making themselves feel bad and enforcing this on others. Why does no one want to see?

mentalhealth,fby8rbv,t3_eerbhq,1577210843.0,"Here in the netherlands i am in the comittee of a group called never2bealone and we try to normalise the concept of feeling alone and the mental health issues that arise from it and vice versa.

Whilst the group has 300 members now it is still in it's start up process. We have a small group of volunteers to try and grow and give the people who come to our gatherings/partys a feeling of being together and acceptance.

I am fairly new in this but i try my best to just be me and also make people with certain issues feel accepted and welcomed. Anyone got some pointers?? Any pointers will do since i am also fairly intrested in psychology and always want to learn more.

The reason i wanted to say this is because we have this after christmas party januari 8th and this just came to mind haha.

Also i have felt alone for most of my life and even with people around me i still feel hollow and alone most of the time. I know how one might feel when they have no one to speak their mind too and it hurst more than any physical pain one might endure.

Peace, and happy christmas. Make sure you enjoy the good things rather than focussing on the bad ;)"
