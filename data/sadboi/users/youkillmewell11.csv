AmItheAsshole,fczwoo2,t3_ejopmz,1578109903.0,"YTA- Fellow teacher here.  What you did is exactly what makes teaching so hard.  Posting nonsense about a teacher on social media (you say you didn‚Äôt name names, but that people figured out the teachers identify anyway) instead of having a meeting with her, or maybe even the principal if you weren‚Äôt still weren‚Äôt happy, is just trashy. You posted that for your own validation.  You didn‚Äôt even do it for your child, you humiliated this teacher because you HAD to be right."
AmItheAsshole,fbwdzu1,t3_eemqog,1577147423.0,"NTA at all- I could‚Äôve written this myself about my own sister! It‚Äôs so frustrating, knowing how much you give and how much others give, and she just continues to make poor decisions. You would be doing yourself a huge favor by not continuing to pay for her not-so-great choices."
AmItheAsshole,f8u50pw,t1_f8u2hns,1574819421.0,"I appreciate your response- thank you!

Yes, I agree. Clearly we are not on the same page. 

Prioritizing is a good idea as well. I am so grateful for all of the opportunities I‚Äôve been given. I love my job, I love tutoring small groups of kiddos, and I love my Master‚Äôs program.  Balancing all those plus things at home has been challenging for sure and I do miss my therapist lol. 

I don‚Äôt believe the overspending comes from me not being there enough, as I am home by 4:30 at the latest every day and always am sure to cook dinner when I get home and make sure my husband has something for lunch.  I‚Äôve been driving him to and from work as well most days. His schedule is pretty lax, so he can go in and leave when he wants. He just goes and leaves when I do, basically, and doesn‚Äôt have the burden of paying for gas either. He has always been impulsive with money and buys little things that he wants and it adds up quickly. Lately, he‚Äôs been buying so much that he ‚Äúforgets‚Äù he also has bills to pay as well.  I‚Äôve talked with him about that. It‚Äôs completely irresponsible. 

I will continue to work on marriage counseling as well."
AmItheAsshole,f8u3ipo,t1_f8u313j,1574818264.0,Thank you. I agree. There are just some things I don‚Äôt think I should have to tell him to do and it has taken its toll for sure.
AmItheAsshole,f8u305q,t1_f8u11tt,1574817866.0,"Sure thing!

When we moved into our first home together (4 years ago), my husband had a few set chores that were always his. He takes out the trash, he sweeps by our cat‚Äôs litter box, and he collects the garbage from the little bathroom trash cans. He isn‚Äôt very handy, so major things that break often need professional help to fix.  But after a year or so he stopped doing those chores on his own and required me to tell him to do those chores. He is similar in that he needs a list of things to do.  I‚Äôve also told him if you see a mess, please just pick it up- anything helps. He watches me clean and doesn‚Äôt willingly offer to help, which frustrates me. But you are right, a list could be helpful here. 

No, he will not clean up a mess in a timely manner unless I tell him to or I end up doing it myself. A mess is pop or beer cans overflowing in a small trash can or near the trash can on the floor, food wrappers on the floor by the couch, clothes thrown near the laundry basket- these kinds of things. 

We discussed the extra job of tutoring and going back to school. He highly encouraged me to do it and seemed really excited for me at the time. 

As far as the purchases go, he spends a lot of money on small things that add up quickly as soon as we get paid because he thinks he has all this money, and then before he knows it he doesn‚Äôt have money for the bills. We split the bills so I pay some and he pays for the rest. He‚Äôs always been really irresponsible and impulsive with money. We have had many talks about this. 

I appreciate your questions! Hopefully I‚Äôve answered them all. Let me know if you need anything else!"
AmItheAsshole,f8u1hbo,t1_f8u0agt,1574816699.0,"I appreciate your judgement. You are so right- nagging does not do anything to help any situation. We have had several conversations where I‚Äôve tried to explain my side, but have been shut down.  So, after a while of that, it has been hard for me to even want to have a conversation where I have to again, explain my side and explain my needs. But, as I said, you are right and another conversation is probably needed. 

I began seeing a therapist last year for myself and really enjoyed having someone to talk to. My husband didn‚Äôt really like the idea of me talking to anybody about my problems and he made that very clear but I still went because it made me feel a lot better. I unfortunately did have to stop seeing the therapist for a while because I‚Äôve been so busy and I could never find a time in my schedule that fit with theirs, but my therapist also mentioned marriage counseling. I brought it up to my husband and he refused that option. I do think it is a good idea as well, so maybe in the future."

EatingDisorders,essye6w,t1_essr8l0,1562259524.0,I had a hard time with my mom too when she found out about my ED.  My mom called me disgusting and never once sought help for me (my ED began at 16).  She kept me away from family members or anyone she knew because I ‚Äúmade her look bad‚Äù.  It took me 10 years to tell a professional.  I respect this mom so much for looking for advice rather than lashing out.
EatingDisorders,esrttuc,t3_c90ab4,1562236510.0,"Hi! It means so much that you‚Äôre looking for advice on how to help your daughter. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs hard to know what to do about such a touchy subject.  

A specialist for ED will work much better than a general therapist. I think that seeing someone who can truly understand will be helpful. 

As for what else you can do, let her know you‚Äôre there for her always if she needs someone to talk to or needs help.  She needs to know she‚Äôs not alone, even though she probably feels that way. Try to praise her on things unrelated to weight or beauty. It may get frustrating, but one thing to not do is place blame on her or the situation. 

Just love her through it and get some professional help for her. 

Best of luck! You are an amazing mom."

EatingDisorders,erw1ppq,t3_c4c520,1561330799.0,"How long have you been taking your meds? When I started with antidepressants, they made me lose my appetite as well (which, I was happy about because I do have an ED).  After a couple of weeks though my appetite was back to normal.  I know a couple of weeks is a hard time to go without a normal appetite though, just thought maybe it would come back after you‚Äôre more used to your medication.  You don‚Äôt have to switch medications per se, but maybe bring it up with your doctor the next time you see him/her and just see if it‚Äôs something that will eventually go back to normal. 

A protein drink that I really like is Premier Protein. I liked those because it filled me up but didn‚Äôt make me feel overly stuffed."

EatingDisorders,erunv6k,t3_c3nwdu,1561290249.0,"I am so sorry that all of this has happened. I am appalled by your father‚Äôs behavior and obviously, what he said escalated your ED. Parents don‚Äôt realize how much their words/actions can harm their children.  

I guess the biggest thing here is, do you trust this family friend? I think it speaks volumes of them that they took you in when your parents kicked you out. If you do trust them, truly trust them, I would be honest with them and tell them the basics. You don‚Äôt have to be extremely detailed, but you can mention that you have lost control of this and you need help. I don‚Äôt think that they would react like your dad... but I can‚Äôt speak for them. They do seem a bit more understanding, in my opinion though. 

Know too that you are not alone. There are so many of us, myself included, who can relate to what you‚Äôre going through. It‚Äôs hard. But if you ask this family friend for some help, you may be able to stop an otherwise horrific ED journey. Best of luck to you OP."
EatingDisorders,erungja,t3_c3nyl7,1561289687.0,"Well, as you said, she may not be receiving the ‚Äúright‚Äù help.  Is there any way that you can talk with her about maybe finding another therapist who is more helpful? 

I know you said that there‚Äôs a lot of changes since college, which is great, but is your wife ready to get better? I think that it starts with her, but having your full support is also important. I know you‚Äôre frustrated. I frustrated a lot of people too and felt so guilty, but an eating disorder takes such a hold on a person. Once you‚Äôre in, it‚Äôs hard to get out. 

Please realize too that even though she has been with her eating disorder for a long time, it really is a lot of baby steps. It has taken me 11 years to just get a therapist, and obviously I‚Äôm not anywhere near close to where I should be. 

My big takeaway here I guess is that I know it‚Äôs hard to understand, but eating disorders and their aftermaths can be lifelong... love her through it. She‚Äôs been through more than you can ever know."

What are your future plans? Are you still in high school? Going to college? Moving out shortly? The best thing for me was to move out and be on my own. I‚Äôm not sure if this is a possibility for you yet, but I truly found myself when I left for school.  It helped me a lot to remove myself from the situation because my father will never change.
