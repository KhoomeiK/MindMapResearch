I offered my condolences, but politely declined the offer the be repatriated for the funeral (no thank you very much, I'm happy with the peace I made with her personally when she was alive, I'll pass on the family reunion).  This caused a huge blowup that brought up all those abandonment issues AGAIN, especially with my sister, who is still aligned with ED.  But I'll tell you this time was different than before.  I have had 2 years to learn what that feeling in my chest is- it was a symptom of the complex PTSD I had, caused by that abusive raising.  The more I worked on that codependency in me the healthier the separation feels.  Now I see what they are doing is about them, not about me. My life is so much more peaceful, I wish I had done it sooner.
