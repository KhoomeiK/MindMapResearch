LSU,fmqqjuu,t3_fwph4t,1586304922.0,"No, absolutely not! I've been in the Honors for two years now and the biggest difference is that when everyone else is complaining about their classes being filled up, I'm just chilling because I got into my classes a week ago lol. It's also fun because they offer super cool Honors courses! Definitely the best professors I've had at LSU so far have been professors of those courses. I'm also in two other clubs where I've met tons of other people. I had a lot of fun (with tons of parties) in Laville, but you don't have to live there if you don't want to. You can also choose how involved you want to be in the Honors College. I recommend to everyone who is considering it to go for it because the benefits are huge. 

Also, I'm seeing a lot of comments on this post about dropping the Honors college after the first two years. I'd say that although you can easily do that if you want, you have tons of options for the last few years. The goal is to do some sort of senior thesis that you work on for a year, but you don't have to do that to remain in the Honors College. You have to get 6 hours of honors credit and maintain a 3.5 GPA per year in order to get the benefits, but you don't have to do a thesis or even a ton of extra hours to stay for the whole four years.

They're super flexible and overall I just can't recommend it enough!"

One thing is that Spruce is kind of to the edge of campus, which isn't too bad since we have rental bike systems and campus is definitely walkable. Just consider that it's pretty much on the opposite side of campus from PFT.

Some other really nice halls that are maybe a bit closer to PFT are Laville and Evangeline. I lived in Laville and it was great, although the bathrooms are kind of rough. I also stayed in Evangeline for a few nights when my roommate had a psychotic breakdown (lol long story) and it was beyond nice. I would absolutely recommend it if you can.

Also, about you not being able to go out with your friends again, I really don't think they're your friends if they let things like this happen. How could none of them have known that their friend, Dave, was planning to rape their other friend?
