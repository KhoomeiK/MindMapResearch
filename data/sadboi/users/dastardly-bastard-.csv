NonBinaryTalk,fqzvep6,t1_fqzr6c0,1589776341.0,"Aw oh no. Also, im about to fight your your homophobic  family and anyone else, bc that's shitty.  You deserve better. 

I guess any other advice on the name front is just keep your eye open on like baby name websites. A lot of them have unisex names or nickname name suggestions. 

You could also look for cool names inspired from your favorite characters from some books,tv, videogames,movies,etc. 

There's a subreddit where you can test out different names and pronouns online, but I forgot what it's called.ðŸ˜“  But I'm pretty sure there are other ways to go about it. So if you find something your kinda thinking about you can test it.  Good luck!"
NonBinaryTalk,fqzpg7j,t1_fqzmt1b,1589772378.0,"Yeah it's pretty tough. Another option would be to shorten your middle name, if you have one that can be shortened. A lot of people go by their middle names and most dont bat an eye. However, I know that might not work for everyone. It might be basic advice since I feel like a lot of people think about that as one of their first choices. 

Personally since I'm not 100% sure I'm nb, I'm paranoid that I'll figure something out, come out to everyone and regret it. I dont want to seem attention seeking and make a big deal out of it. Although regardless, I wouldnt mind going by another name..."
depression,fqwawjg,t3_gl8he5,1589698084.0,"Definitely, I really wish I got help a lot earlier, maybe even at a very young age. I feel like I was prone to mental health issues, even though I was happy, I was bullied a lot so I forced myself to blend in and didnt allow myself to enjoy things. I didnt want to make myself a target and it worked. 

It's just now, as an adult,  I cant enjoy anything. Everything just feels like a minor distraction and I'm just learning how to express myself. I have a tendency to just push out any emotion and replace it with anger. 

 Not only that, but I have anxiety, depression and ocd. I feel like it's too late for me, meds and therapy havent worked and my mental health has only deteriorated. I cant even afford therapy anymore...life just sucks and I'll probably just give in..."

Anxiety,fqvr0p4,t3_gl5o58,1589683237.0,"I think talking about what's going on builds a better understanding between yourself and others. When people realise that their friends and family members struggle with mental health problems, they are less likely to demonize others who are going through something similar. (if you dont have shitty family and friends).

Being open about mental illness could also help someone be open about their's or realise that they might be going through something aswell. It could help encourage that person to go seek help and realise what they are going through is okay.

I tend not to hide my mental illness anymore. Well its not really a choice at this point. I tend to have a lot of panic attacks and people say I just have ""that look"" like I've been though shit. So people just can kinda tell. I'm open about it so I dont have to lie about everything. It's a lot less stress not having to hide that you are sick.

That being said, there are people who will not care or support you. Some might just be ambivalent. I try to cut out toxic people from my life. I have enough problems and douche-canoes dont need to be another. It's another thing if you are living with family who isnt supportive."
depression,fqvigex,t3_gl0m0i,1589677967.0,"I dont mind some sunlight, but when it's extremely bright, I feel sick to my stomach and I get a headache. My favorite weather is  partly cloudy or thunderstorms."
depression,fqv72ia,t3_gl1vmv,1589671184.0,"Yeah I get that. I delete a lot of posts I make, but I figure I might as well write them. Worst thing  that could happen is some douchebag says something shitty or no one responds. Best thing  that could happen is someone might reach out and help or I might help someone else. 

I would say if your not going to write a post, maybe start journaling (if you're not already)  sometimes just getting your thoughts on page  can be very cathartic."
NonBinaryTalk,fqsdx2e,t3_gkivyc,1589604689.0,"You can totally be andro with long hair! Like what others said, clothing helps a lot. Things like graphic t shirts, button downs, (denim) jackets, hoodies etc.

 There are also various colors and patterns you could play around with that could help hide your curves if you want to.For me I have  curves but I'm short, I think small but busy patterns help distract and blend my shape. 

Binders help a lot. I also think hats like beanies and base ball caps look really cool with long hair. If you want the appearance of short hair you could try tying your hair up and sticking it inside the hat.

This is generally if you want to look on the more masc side of andro, but you could maybe mix these with some more feminine stuff to if you are feeling that."

HealthAnxiety,fqgpk9g,t3_gitiru,1589353002.0,"It usually starts with a tight feeling in my chest. I feel like my airways are closing up. My heart rate rises and I gasp for air. I cant breathe and I become overwhelemed with dizziness. My lungs feel like they are on fire and the churning of my stomach is nauseating. My head floods with racing thoughts. It's as if I'm drowning in my own mind. Shaking, my whole body feels like its burning and  drenched in sweat. I try get out of the situation that triggered my anxiety, but my limbs feel like jelly. They start to tingle and feel weak. It feels like I'm going to die all I can do is curl up in a safe spot and wait for it to end. Sometimes they end in half an hour or so, but sometimes, it'll be hours."
Anxiety,fqenynt,t3_gifya2,1589310714.0,"Yeah I do that too.  Too me, a bathroom feels safe and private. They are a bit more cozy and I dont feel out in the open or exposed. I also get very nauseous during a panic attack, so I feel more prepared next to the toilet if I do puke. I also get overheated so I can always splash some water on my face and neck to cool down. 

Plus, I think theres something grounding about staring at your own reflection. I don t know why, but it kinda snaps me back into reality. Like, when I go into the bathroom while panicking, my immediate reaction is to splash my face and look in a mirror."

mentalhealth,fqe6nq0,t1_fqe52v8,1589302615.0,I'm sorry that happened to you as well. It sucks because I dont think people take children seriously when it comes to things like this. There's a difference between kids roughhousing and bullying/abuse.

I still have nightmares and  trouble socializing. I cant connect with people like others can and I have very bad  anxiety and depression.

mentalhealth,fq9y4cs,t1_fq9ts0p,1589209308.0,"I think I get your point of view. I would say that it is possible to have a happy life with mental illness in the same way someone with chronic health conditions is able to live a happy life. It's a challenge and somedays are better than others, but it can managed with treatment. There's a variety of different reasons to have a mental illness, not just things deriving from your past or current situation. Genetics can play a big role.

However a lot of people who say ""you cant be depressed because you have a good life."" Often dont think about the quality of life of the person and just think about the check list of things the person meets. (I.e. stable family, middle class, job) but the often dont see you can have those things and be unfulfilled. 

So I agree with that someone who has a mental Illness often dont experience fulfillment and joy solely due to their mental health issues.  However, I think it is possible to still deal with mental illness, but manage it and live a good life. I 

As for what I want to do about it? I try to have conversations with them. I try to explain why someone who has a ""good life"" on paper, can still have mental health issues. Or just having material things/being provided for, doesnt make a fulfilling life. I also want people to know that it's okay to experience mental illness regardless of their background."

mentalhealth,fq9sqrv,t1_fq97cfq,1589206280.0,"Yeah. A lot of people still think having depression is the same as being sad and that it can be treated in the same way. It honestly kills people.

A stimulant like caffeine helps with a lot of the shitty symptoms I get from depression. I'm often very unmotivated and tired and I get very bad brain fog and trouble concentrating, having a couple of cups helps. Weirdly enough, on days I'm very depressed, I have a higher tolerance for caffeine and no matter how muchI drink, I still feel tired.

Right now, maybe try and go grab a glass of water and drink a bit. Maybe set a goal of how much water to drink everyday. 

It's okay if you dont accomplish whatever you need to do all the time. Maybe you only do 25% of whatever task, its better than 0%. You can work towards those goals at whatever pace you need.

tiredness, insomnia, headaches, shakiness,chills,overheating,sweating, chest tightness, mild chest pain, stomach aches, nausea, dizziness,heart palpitations, quick heart rate,sound sensitivity and tingling in my hands and feet. 

Also, when I'm worried about a particular illness or condition, my anxiety has a tendency to mimic those symptoms. For example:

As a kid, I saw a classmate have an allergic reaction to peanuts. For a while, I was worried I had an unknown food allergy so sometimes when I ate something , I would feel my throat closing up and I would feel itchy. It turns out, that i never had any food allergies and it was my anxiety."

It's just really messy and I dont live alone so it's really awkward trying to explain why my clothes are covered in blood and why have cuts. It's a lot of work cleaning and taking care if the wounds so they dont become infected. I cant afford to go to the doctor that often and I'm a major germaphobe. The thought if having to get stitches or that I might get an infection freaks me out. I usually just self harm in ways that dont break the skin instead, so I guess it doesnt really stop me.

As for suicide, I'm not seriously suicidal. Its mostly ideations, because I'm too much if a coward to just end it. I dont believe in an afterlife, so I dont think theres anything better than this shitty life.

OCD,fp768oa,t1_fp750oz,1588364806.0,"Yeah I had a therapist, but when I brought up my intrusive thoughts, they just sent me to a new therapist. When i brought it up with the new one, they didnt know what was going on either."
OCD,fp71hvl,t1_fp6oy9f,1588362337.0,That's an Interesting perspective I havent thought about.
OCD,fp71bm7,t1_fp6ylb7,1588362249.0,I suppose that's true. I actually think it is a bit of a compulsion at this point. I do have a problem with over analyzing things and so I'll try to just accept them and let them be.
OCD,fp6ol2y,t1_fp6flxl,1588355899.0,Yeah I suppose becoming indifferent is the only thing I can try to do at this point. It's scary to feel like you're losing yourself. I personally just try to push all of it aside and drown out the thoughts with videogames and music. I suppose trying to be a kind person is a healthier way about it.
Anxiety,fp6n0vy,t3_gbgkz9,1588355137.0,"I feel this. For once, I dont feel guilty for being an agoraphobe. I dont need an excuse for wasting my life indoors. I can just sit at home without this pressure that I NEED to be doing something with my life. I literally cant do anything about what's happening."
HealthAnxiety,fp41i3b,t1_fp408hg,1588289843.0,"Yeah I checked. It was within expiration date, but where I live, the humidity and temp has been fluctuating a lot. That probably didnt help it last."
HealthAnxiety,fp3wkfy,t1_fp3uu1h,1588287144.0,Thanks for the help! I realised that I basically was freaked out over nothing and my stomach feels a lot better now.
Anxiety,fp12izx,t3_gahj36,1588222658.0,Im sorry that your therapist told you that. Reminding someone that others are suffering doesnt help anyone. It doesnt help you and it doesnt help those who have it worse than you. Someone is always going to have it worse and someone is always going to be better off. People should be allowed to feel the way they do. Mental illness shouldnt be a dick measuring contest.
Anxiety,fp1071e,t3_gaarcc,1588221003.0,"Yeah anxiety is really physical too. It sucks when I say I feel sick, but my family says ""calm down it's JUST your anxiety!"" It's really obnoxious and unhelpful. Most of the time I know it's my anxiety!"
mentalhealth,fowy4g5,t1_fowpvbj,1588129673.0,I completely get that. Female biology is so overly complicated and inefficient.
depression,fov0bem,t3_g9ndgw,1588093307.0,"Damn, I really feel this. I've had anxiety and depression since I was 14 (now 21) and over the years it's like my brain is slowly deteriorating. My anxiety evolved into panic disorder, multiple phobias and OCD, my depression has only gotten worse and my memory and concentration is completely fucked. It really feels like mental illness is like the cancer of the psyche."
depression,fosfnrq,t1_fos0sl6,1588029782.0,"Thanks, I think a specific schedule might help a bit as well as reminding myself that feeling exhausted from working out is also a sign of accomplishment."
depression,fosfflf,t1_fosc1ek,1588029656.0,"Yeah, I get that.  I was doing yard work and as much as I disliked it at least I felt accomplished, I liked that I could see some results."
mentalhealth,fosf86u,t1_fosetut,1588029542.0,"I've tried that, it's just that its everywhere. Even on tv or ads between YouTube videos.  I do as much as I can, but it's  pretty much going on in the back of my mind. Not to mention, my family members watch the news and stuff related to the pandemic, because one of then works in a hospital with covid patients and wants to be informed. But yeah I try my best to do avoid it."
