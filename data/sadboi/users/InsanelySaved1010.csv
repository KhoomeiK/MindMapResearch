You paint the cow, but mess up some details or change some feature or the color is just a little bit off.
    
I'm not a painter and could not paint a cow better than a 6 year old, but im obsessed with cows and know every little detail about cows so when I look at the picture all I see is the details that don't line up and that the color is off enough for me to notice, which ruins any enjoyment I would have normally experienced when looking at the picture.

All I can do is limit the amount of time I'm around others.
    
It took me years to realize I was mentally ill and a few more years to get diagnosed with bp2 and adhd. I knew something was wrong, but couldn't figure it out. Slowly going crazy.
    
No one wants to be or act like  a piece of shit, but we all do at some point.
    
My advice, have compassion anyway and if you need to set a boundary around their shitty behavior  do it or maybe ask if they are depressed or anxious and try helping guiding them to meds or therapy. 

I see people without mental illness be just as shitty so just take a deep breath and sit with the realization that we are all dumb monkeys trying to control dumb monkey impulses. 
    
Believe me when I say I dont want to be here. I'm trying to hold on for my parents and as soon as they no longer need my help I'm gone. 
    
Being a piece of shit  due to mental illness isn't a license to be a piece of shit, but it is a side effect that takes time/practice to learn how to control through meds, therapy, and coping skills.

This post imo is written in the same piece of shit spirit it tries to call out because it lacks compassion . . . Just my opinion.
    
Seems like something I would do if I was manic . . ."
