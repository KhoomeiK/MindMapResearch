ApplyingToCollege,fqubhg6,t3_gkzq6u,1589655737.0,"AP Spanish is a really wonderful course if you like the language. I took it this year, and it’s been my favorite course of my junior year. The course is very conversation and speaking-based (especially the exam), but I think you’ll improve by taking it. If you’re really worried about starting the course with your level of speech, try watching shows/movies or reading books in Spanish and repeating out loud what you hear/read. It sounds kind of awkward, but it helps get vocab and sounds into your head. I know many people in my class that started the course with lots of insecurity regarding their speech level, and now, in finishing it, they feel much more confident and ready to take the exam. Good luck!"

Sat,fqqwf5t,t3_gkge81,1589573179.0,"Don't sweat it too much. After AP tests are over, create a study plan that works for you and follow it. Khan Academy is great at sending daily reminder emails on how much work to do and when, so use it if that structure helps you. You've still got three months, so I wouldn't stress about it, but just get on it as soon as you can."
Spanish,fqqg8gw,t1_fqpcbol,1589564985.0,"I would recommend doing it! I started studying Spanish a few years before French, and having studied Spanish really helped me out with French. Of course they're not identical and learning two languages at once isn't the easiest task in the world, but I think it's more worth it to learn them together than to wait until you think your Spanish is ""good enough."" I received a lot of advice against it as well when I started French, but I'm so glad I did because it's not even remotely as hard as people tried to tell me. Go for it!"

mentalhealth,fp8pu5h,t3_gc1c9w,1588399126.0,"i feel you. this situation has just made my mental illness even more daunting than it already was. just keep yourself distracted as much as you can. it's easier said than done, but try it out. try to pick up something new or change up the organization of your bedroom. it sounds laughable, i know, but sometimes the smallest things keep your attention for long enough to get you out of a shitty feeling that could turn dangerous. feel free to message me if you need to, i get it."
