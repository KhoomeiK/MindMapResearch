No, I don't think SARS, Swine Flu, Bird Flu, Ebola, etc have received as much hype as this outbreak is getting. And that could be because, as you suggest, that this really is THE big one. But I don't think that this is the big one. I think is that the 'Medium is the Message' and the media is seeing a huge payday as a panicked public tunes in and clicks on their latest urgent story. As for the highly parsed statement from the CDC, I think that might have something to do with a Cover-Your-Ass mentality that is now present in our current government. 

It is notable that the WHO's statements are far less dire. Here are yesterday's comments from the Director-General:

>...The joint task force found that the epidemic peaked and plateaued between the 23rd of January and the 2nd of February, and has been declining steadily since then.

[Source](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-mission-briefing-on-covid-19---26-february-2020)

You said:

What exactly are you seeing when you look at this situation? You’re saying it’s all hype and paranoia, but you must see the global reaction, right? Do you think China would willingly cripple their economy over the flu? Do you honestly think this is no big deal and world governments are just being silly?
Yes, the news likes to hype everything up, but have you ever seen this kind of reaction before? Nobody closed borders because of Ebola. China didn’t quarantine hundreds of millions over SARS. MERS wasn’t even a blip on the Western radar. Swine flu was just as hyped up but the US wasn’t quarantining people on military bases over it.
I don’t think this is the end of the world, and we don’t need to panic, but it’s not nothing. You keep asking people to prove the tiniest detail, which is fine, but you have zero proof that this is “just the flu.”

The flu kills 646,000 people a year, worldwide - disproportionaly in poor countries / regions. [Source](https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=208914)

I read somewhere that flu mortality rates are somewhere around 0.1%. And that's 0.1% with decades of treatment knowledge and vaccines that may impact mortality rates VS. 0.7% from the Coronavirus that has just made its appearance on the world stage and we understand very little about how to best treat.
