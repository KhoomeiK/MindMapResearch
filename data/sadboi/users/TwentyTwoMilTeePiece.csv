Some of them around sexual areas, I was just really scared I'd be some kind of monster (I was diagnosed with OCD). I had thought of my cousins in sexual ways and maybe other children in my class, both boys and girls. Most importantly they are thoughts, and just that - in fact, it's commendable that he feels such empathy for someone that he thinks he has hurt and an indication that he really doesn't want to hurt anyone. Without going into too much detail I grew up and realised what I liked, I made sure to find the line between right and wrong and I take pride in knowing that amongst the people in the world, I can confidently say I'm definitely at less risk of being a risk to, well, anyone, I've met much worse people than me. I think encouraging your son that wierd sexual thoughts are fine, masturbate to what you want, maybe just know what's appropriateto actuallh perform (mother-daughter porn is a big trend rn, many people also are into it, doesn't mean they'll immediately go bang their if they get stuck in the dryer).

Bottom line imo, support him, offer advice on knowing what is legal and illegal and make it easy for him, making it hard on him won't help anyone and might upset him further."

I've studied at least 6 different arts under all sorts of instructors, some very well respected and fantastic martial artists/fighters.
List of what I've trained:
- Jeet Kune Do
- Boxing
- Muay Thai
- OCFM genre (Gaia, MFFS, PPDT)
- Taekwondo
- Defendo arrest and restrain system

I plan to train BJJ and perhaps some Japanese Ju Jutsu to get some groundwork going and I'll plan from there.

I train everyday sometimes maybe only for 20 mins that day, sometimes for 4, 5 or 6 hours, sometimes I might do 3x 30 mins a day. Even when I'm not training physically I'm thinking about what I can improve on, I study much of the concepts that many of the arts I have practiced are built upon, Bruce Lee was a pioneer when it came to mixing what he had learned - ""Take what is useful, discard what is not""; it's as simple as that, just have the sense to know what you will find useful and you're golden.

I don't think I'll be world famous, I might not be the best, I might not even be good - but to answer your question: yes, it's possible to have that mindset, martial arts is my thing, it's my jam.

I did have housing benifit, but due to the nature of my current accommodation, which is a sort of halfway house for people with mental illness, I can't claim any benifits.
