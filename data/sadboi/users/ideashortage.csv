BorderlinePDisorder,fmry17o,t1_fmro8cq,1586339713.0,"I have Bipolar 1, too (3rd generation, yay!) which already predisposes me to hallucinate. So it's a combo, often, where I get paranoid because of BPD and that triggers a BP1 manic episode and then weeee. If you saw the new ""The Invisible Man,"" I used to feel like the main woman all the time until I got on some good meds. Now it's much more rare. I think in part cuz now I know that it's a symptom, and not real, so I can calm down faster, as long as a bipolar episode isn't happening at the same time.

CW: child abuse:

I often have this overwhelming fear that someone is trying to kill me. I imagine it stems from my dad actually making me believe he would kill me to punish my mother. I think I developed BPD due to trauma, and I was probably more likely to ""catch"" it because of the bipolar family history. But, that's just my personal theory."
bipolar,fmrxfwk,t3_fwo07o,1586339063.0,"That's the same dose I'm on, along with Fluoxetine 40mg. I've been doing pretty well. I still have some mixed episodes but they're a lot more controlled these days. Even though I'm not on any antipsychotics my manic psychosis is now VERY rare. Like it went from every 3-6 months a big freakout to once a year or less. I was started at a much lower dose but it did nothing for my severe depression until we went up to 200. It's definitely better for me than anything else I've tried."
BorderlinePDisorder,fmpq4s7,t3_fwn6qq,1586285313.0,"I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist/psychologist. I came in for an evaluation because I was spiraling out of control and people I was close to begged me to get help. I was shocked at the diagnosis. I resisted it hard core (still do, in spurts). I was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I've been in therapy for a year."
trichotillomania,fmo6r3z,t3_fw8exy,1586247454.0,I recently did this and I have never felt so free. I haven't been able to pull since and my hair that was always very thin where I pulled repeatedly started to fill in. Good for you! Do what works!
BorderlinePDisorder,fmo65vm,t3_fwf3lf,1586246823.0,Hallucinations... me. I had no idea it was a symptom. I was afraid for years that I was going to completely lose it.  I can work myself into so much paranoia that I imagine someone is following me or something is crawling on the walls. It scares me.
BorderlinePDisorder,fmatytd,t3_ftpbz7,1585907737.0,"It's one of my worst symptoms. I get very freaked out by it. I am just suddenly not there. It's like I am an artificial intelligence watching itself realize it doesn't exist. I am always trying to avoid noticing it, cuz when I do it's like watching a tape run, I am just doing what the script dictates."
BPD,flwq55d,t3_framg2,1585560646.0,"I had no idea so many other people with BPD felt this way. Last month I told my therapist I just want out of my entire life, to disappear with no consequences and start a new life where no one would know how bad I am. You're not alone, and, apparently, neither am I."
BPD,fljfqys,t3_fp7m1y,1585210613.0,"I do. My gender identity is very unstable. I've never thought I was the ""opposite"" gender (FTM) but I often feel like I might be a nonbinary gender, or be devoid of gender all together. I can't tell if it's gender dysphoria or identity dysphoria. It's one of the things that freaks me out the most, cuz then I have intense guilt and imposter syndrome."
BPD,fljf334,t3_fp5wqj,1585209812.0,"Oh gee, yes. Every few months I ""reinvent"" myself and redesign the whole site. I'm considering just making my account more generic--posting pictures of interesting things I see and not worrying about having a theme. I've been trying very hard to just ""exist"" lately. Without trying to have a brand. It is so hard, because a brand makes me feel stable, for awhile anyway. Then it gives me dysphoria when my avatar, as it were, evolves away from the brand."
BPD,flj9lbk,t3_fp51l3,1585203552.0,"I go back and forth during this current shelter in place thing. But, in general I'm actually pretty good in a crisis. I feel little to nothing because chaos is my element. I grew up trying to manage the moods of 2 chaotic parents, so in an emergency I usually go immediately into survival mode. Which, for me, is stoicism."
