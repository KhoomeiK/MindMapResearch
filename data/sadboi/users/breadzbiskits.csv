india,fq59mjj,t1_fq59eed,1589097191.0,">Because if we start fudging the numbers, we are fucked.

There's no denying this. But even if they try it, the backlash will be swift and severe. That's one thing about India. No one can hide information for too long. And we the public, who are generally tolerant, have a limit. If we are tested beyond the limit, the repercussions can get quite ugly. And I expect they know this. If they want to have a even a remote chance for 2024, they will have to toe the right  side of the line."
india,fq594ek,t3_gguav1,1589096687.0,"That's not what they are doing. If an RT-PCR test reveals that the patient had the virus, his death is being marked as a covid death for now. Only WB has been effing about in this regard. During the final audit, after the pandemic has subsided, these numbers might change.

 Unlike the US, the Indian pandemic response, with all its flaws and inefficiencies,  is doing one thing right. Which is not downplaying the severity of the situation. The government has no logical reason to hide numbers in an open democracy like hours. Because sooner or later, the truth will out, unlike a system like in China. Doing so will be political suicide. 

They are already facing a backlash due to the migrant crisis. If they are deliberately trying to lower their numbers by false reporting, then they will be digging their own graves. I trust that, at least they are not THAT stupid."
india,fq58g4a,t1_fq57ae4,1589096011.0,"That's for afterwards, when the pandemic has started to subside and things are more in control. Further bifurcation of an already confusing system will just complicate things even more. There will come a time for audit and further classification. Unfortunately, trying to do that now will just put more pressure on an already inefficient and strained system."
india,fq54bsh,t1_fq526zt,1589092094.0,"Yes, but what if the patient was already at low renal function and the the coronavirus just happened to push them over the edge. Diabetes may cause renal failure. But antivirals also put a huge load on the renal system. Enough for even healthy people to develop renal issues. It's extremely subjective. It cannot be generalized all the time. 

If the diabetes was a relatively new development in the patient, and the patient dies, would you put him in the same basket as say a person living with diabetes for years?

Diseases are not binary. The conditions are a spectrum of large points of severity. 

It's an extremely subjective and sensitive issue that needs careful review of the patients history, treatments undergone, the patient's historical response to the treatments. Its, as I said, a very grey area. The covid diagnoses and its effects and behaviour in patients is not only of sociopolitical importance, but also of utmost epidemiological importance. It directly affects the data available to the scientific community, which influences decisions when developing potential mitigation strategies, vaccines and cures. It's a process that cannot be rushed and generalized. That is more important than just putting the numbers under one cause of death and moving on. It might be quite simple for us lay people. But for the scientific and medical community, it's not.


As far as I know, these committees are only there to make sure the cause of death lists all conditions that the patient was suffering from. It has no effect on the number of deaths reported."
india,fq50pkr,t1_fq4zfrg,1589089015.0,"This has been a bone of contention in all countries. It's a very grey area. It would have been black and white if all people with comorbidity died after contracting the virus and all healthy people lived. But we are seeing completely healthy active people dying, and frail old grannies with a host of issues fighting and surviving it. It's a very confusing thing. Which is why there are independent expert panelled committees to determine the survival probabilities of such cases if they did not get the virus.

For example, if someone had been given 6 months to live due to a bad heart and they died of covid 5 months in what would you call it? A heart related death or covid death.

It's never a right or wrong answer in such cases. And this process of studying the cases is what is taking the 5 to 7 days for declaration of cause of death."

The quarantine facilities that are running right now, can't house them because we are still not sure of relapse If housed with potential and suspected new cases, as you pointed out. They will have to create separate facilities for discharged cases. 

When we as a country are struggling with providing facilities for new cases, it's difficult to expect such separate facilities for discharged cases as well, which will only grow in number as time passes."

Some of these maintenance work is through third party contractors who need to be paid according to a fixed schedule. Right now, there are severe cashflow issues from the government for salaries and contracts. 

Given these issues, we should expect continued power issues in Bangalore in the short term. This has nothing to do with power shortages, more about the residential networks being loaded more than usual and in some high density networks, more than they were designed for.

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!"
Codependency,fpxxoyc,t3_gfxcrb,1588991721.0,"My codependency started with my parents. I came to know of the concept only very recently. I was raised to be completely dependent on them for everything in my life. I was never allowed to do things on my own,  from finishing homework assignments to having my own independent views to going out and having friends.  I used to be completely dependent on them for gratification. Even if I did well, if they were not happy with my performance, i used to feel like shit. 

I'm extremely unsocialised. Like how you'd find unsocialised dogs. No one wants to be friends with me. Everyone who has ever tolerated me has described me as annoying, clingy and obnoxious. I used to think it's just good natured banter till I started to lose social connections en-mass. I've turned into a recluse. I cant do anything by myself, but dont have anyone to do anything with. 

The one person who tolerated me was my girlfriend who I later married. She handled me like a champ for 10 years. Without her, I'm pretty sure I'd be long dead or in jail.

 Even the whole process of marriage was an episode of me trying to convince and impress my parents, as I was irrationally afraid of not including them in my life. I saw my mom feeling threatened by her very existence. She tried her best to break it off, even till about 2 weeks before my marriage. I felt so let down and disgusted by it that my long term simmering depression turned into a full blown behavioural issue. Even after marriage, my wife was treated like an outsider by my parents, day in and day out. And whenever I used to question it, they feigned ignorance. ""WhAt dId We Do? We DiDnT dO AnYtHiNg! It WaS aLL HeR!"" Used to make my blood boil. They are grade A hypocrites. I can't control my emotions anymore. I feel numb, till I get triggered and I explode.

 It's been 14 years since I started to go against them, but still find myself going back to my old ways of trying to please them for gratification. I had to quit my job because I was becoming toxic towards other people and was asked to resign. My wife finally had it with my clingy, codependent behaviors and left the country to get away from me. I don't know where that is going to go. I'm dependent on my parents for sustenance. I want to break free and venture out for myself and be independent, but the last time I did that it ended up hurting a lot of people and I ended up losing my job. I have no idea how to deal with people. 

I started to figure out that they were the problem around high school. It's like an addiction. It's a habit that still haven't been able to completely kick. Baby steps. I'm better now. But I still have long way to go. I was 15 when I started to see the red flags and signs. I'm 28 now."

Schools are supposed to be a place where kids don't just learn the syllabus but also learn life lessons like social behaviour, conduct and morality( not that they actually impart these). So if a student shows misconduct, even outside school, it appears that the school has failed at doing its job. 

This unwritten ""law"" is from the days when the education system was highly respected and was held accountable for their wards' actions. It's a totally different scenario now.

You might do something that will make them feel better. Once, twice , thrice, any number of times. But all it takes is the supporting family member to drop the ball once. Just once. It will undo any and all progress upto that point in time and sometimes will make things worse. 

I depended too much on my family for support when I was in my mild depression stage. They did well most of the times to help me get out of it. But they dropped the ball, gave up on me, got impatient and frustrated with me several times in between. They were not there when I absolutely needed them. And basically pushed themselves on me when I needed my space and got frustrated and borderline violent with me,sometimes, when I tried to create space. 

Each time that happened, my condition got worse and worse. Now I'm a ticking time bomb when it comes to my moods and emotions. I'm numb. I'm all cried out. Therapy came in very late.

india,fpkravf,t3_ge07tf,1588699670.0,"You also need to understand that we have one of the worst , if not the worst news media in the world. Created to cater to our emotional nature with sensationalist crap and invoke an emotional response. For those of us, who don't buy into their bs, it's been one of the most frustrating periods in living memory. We are literally being click baited and having crap shoved down our throats whether we like it or not. 

And nothing plays into sensationalism than things that can spark outrage. Positive happy news does not create this kind of mass emotional responses. 

Having said that, it's not that there is no truth in what they are spewing. Yes, our country is going to shit. The general masses haven't been this polarized in ages. And yes, it will not go away any time soon. But there are good people around us. Even if they are not as aware and depend on the BS for their daily fill of sensationalism and outrage. People who just dont have a second frick to give about what's being paraded as news out there. When it comes down to being part of the society, they will do their bit. Remember, and this is true for the entire world, what you hear out there are only the loudest conversations. But the majority are whispering. It's hard to tune out the loud conversations at the present, but have patience. The topic of the loud conversations will always have something different to shout out. The whispers will more or less stay the same and what they're saying will always stay relevant. It needs patience. Theres no point raising our volumes, just adds to the cacophony. 

Enough with the symbolism. I'm dealing with it by using the news as a table of contents and then going to the actual source. For eg, when the new guidelines came out regarding the next phase of the lockdown, the news mentioned that the MHA had released it. I went straight to the MHA website and got what I required. Avoided the sugar coating and embellishments altogether.

Also, because of the lockdown, the media is the only view we have about the outside world apart from immediately around us. The huge lines and the ""weird""  behaviour of alcohol lovers and the ""widespread flouting of norms"" has been generalized on the news. In reality, there were several examples of a job well done that just went unreported and we just couldn't see it with our own eyes because we are sort of stuck at home. We have just not been able to see the good side because of the major noise of the bad side. Dont lose hope. 

There will always be regression to mean, which in India means a simmering apathy,a no fricks to give attitude and a generally tolerant public. The noisy reporting just gives us the impression that everything everywhere in our country is going to shit. Which is not the case. The situation is bad, but not as bad as the media portrays it to be."

They'll try several times to get you back in the ""fold"". Be calm and say no. Expect them to be borderline violent. But they'll eventually learn to live with it. But that does not mean you should not be there for them when they like to practice and expect you to be around. By the time they accept, you'll be there more for moral support instead of actually partaking in the rituals. There will be a new status quo. Trust me. 

From what I can glean from your rant, you do believe in a higher power, but not religion as a set of rituals and faith. Make sure you mention that. That takes the edge off. Ignore any and all other people trying to convince you to reconsider. All you need to care about is getting it across to your parents, if you strongly believe you should not subscribe to their idea of religion.  It's clear that apart from this, you have no major issues with them.

Of the 6 major high population cities in India, Bangalore ranks 5th in population and 6th in population density. 

Bangalore stands at 17000/sq km

Delhi stands at 29259/sq km

Mumbai stands at 73000/sq.km with just Dharavi at 277000/sq km

Hyderabad is at 18800/sq km

Chennai is at 26553/sq km

If a person with mental illness turns to drugs or other substances to cope with it, they are treated like shit when it turns into a physiological addiction. When was the last time the system treated a drug felon with mental issues differently than the way as ,say, a drug felon without it? Is he offered quality help while incarcerated? 

Touch your heart and say you haven't seen a homeless person differently at any point in time? 

>who says they can't both be done

Absolutely no one. But reality is far from what is expected. It's clear it can be done, but what is not clear is why it isnt being done.

There is no point in going any higher with the relaxations because if it hits a green zone in the present scenario of loosened restrictions,  it will definitely turn into community transmission anyway. Then we are well and truly screwed. 

Realistically speaking, our testing seems to be running at its limit. Quite impressed with what we as a country have achieved so far with respect to the response. I believe the relaxations were a little premature from a purely pandemic response standpoint. But yeah, the govt had to choose the lesser of two evils here.

bangalore,fpjp8ew,t3_gdvbh2,1588676760.0,"The testing has definitely been inadequate,  but the lower number of suspected cases , so far, seems to stem from the fact that Bangalore has a relatively lower avg population density. And we have specific travel patterns within the city. If you check the area wise distribution of cases, majority of the cases are in North Bangalore. Within the city, if you look at the population distribution, we have higher population packed into a few areas and then the rest are distributed relatively loosely. Since this is an imported virus, the first importers were from a slightly affluent background who generally stay in these lower density areas. And we had relatively fewer cases associated with the Tablighi incident. Only Padarayanapura ward had the highest concentration of cases related to the incident. Bangalore is not really a hub for major international travel, unlike the port cities of Mumbai and Chennai, and obviously Delhi is a major international travel hub. Most flights flying in from international destinations go through Mumbai and Delhi. By the time the imported case traffic got high enough in Bangalore, India had already closed its international borders and the lockdown helped isolate Bangalore further. And the cops as you saw were quite intolerant during the initial phase of the lockdown. The fact that certain wards especially in the west and south Bangalore sectors had no reported cases even as of today shows that the lockdown has been effective so far. The new relaxations will definitely change this. The question is by how much.

All this is just my logical reasoning. I have no proof for it.
