There's a chance he's playing the game so much in order to get attention from this girl.
Although since he's playing tournaments, it could be that he's looking to make a career from playing League and understands he needs to put alot of time in.

Either way wouldn't make sense for him to lie and say he's doing homework when he could easily say that he's playing a game.

Maybe show up at his house at a time where he's said that and it shows him online? 

Not sure how much I helped, but I hope you at least feel somewhat different knowing you aren't being over paranoid or anything"

Each finisher has different lengths and there are some swift ones in Revs, especially when using the sword.

As for chaining combos, it does make sense that he want able to in AC2 as he was new to being an Assassin. Although I don't think it was intentional by Ubisoft in any way. They thought of a new mechanic and implemented it in their next games.

I suppose by alot of the logic from OPs POV, it would make Ezio more of a master than Altair, even before Ezio had been introduced to the Assassin's.
