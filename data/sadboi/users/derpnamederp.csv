But hecc 
Im currently in my senior years and been playing tkd since in my juniors but I tend to stop doing it and just go back after a few months. Now that im in my seniors, I still want to continue tkd and become an athlete (never got a chance to be an athlete in my junior years since anxiety was holding me back)  but everything is just too hard for me to even try.

My english sucks 
My bad"
