relationship_advice,fnq34hc,t3_g32bps,1587156776.0,"I’m so sorry to hear that you are going through this. I understand how you feel because I kinda feel the same about the personal space situation. This is really a very toxic environment for you to be in, it’s abusive and rapey and it makes me nervous that you feel like you don’t have the option to say no. Specially the part where you stated saying no and him dismissing in. This scenarios can really create a dent in your mental health and I would advise to seek help and trying to find someone you can talk to about this, someone that you can trust and even run to if you need immediate help. Please protect yourself, protect your space, your emotions and mental health. No guy is worth sacrificing your emotional health, you shouldn’t even have to think about having to put walls to keep yourself safe from your significant other. I understand how others are saying “why haven’t you left” but we have to be mindful of the fact that we don’t really know what going on in someone’s life. The bigger, real picture is something that only you know and it sucks to be judged like that. If you need to talk, feel free to message me, I can try to be emotional support or something. I hope that you find safety and are able to figure out the next step/solution soon."

My ex also had folders with photos and videos of his exes, labeled and all and I thought it was the most fucking creepy shit I’ve ever seen because apart from their folders he also had one for me so... Fuck him tbh. The worst part is that they can’t put themselves in our shoes. How would he feel if you had folders with your exes dick all over it. He’d probably walk away and label you as the crazy ex. I hope that you’re able to find someone who deserves you. He pissed me off and I took it personal because I know how it feels like to be with a narcissistic guy."
