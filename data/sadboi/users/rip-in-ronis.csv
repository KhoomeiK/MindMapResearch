my dad acts in a similar way, so i get the type of love that you have for him. i wish you the best of luck. it’s hard living in fear and deciding if you love somebody enough to dedicate time to change them for the better."

depression,f22joe6,t1_f20b3gu,1569890484.0,"I get what you mean. The people I trust or used to talk to now almost feel like residual from the person I used to be, but now the conversational person who drew them towards me in the first place feels lost. I feel like the people who keep coming back to me for conversations I keep letting down whether that be plans that fall through the cracks or my impulse to not open messages or leave people on seen."
depression,f1yp58j,t1_f1yofnc,1569821252.0,same. so far i’ve been trying to combat my intermittent waves of depression with cleaning my room and taking cold showers and shit like that but its too easy to break habit and fall off schedule with those kinda things when you’re as lazy as i guess you and i are haha

depression,eyyj2x1,t3_czd4c4,1567590023.0,"i know all too well the feeling of seeing your friends out and not knowing what you're doing with your life, and i'm sure to an extent you do too. 

what social media did to me at least was it made me feel like my life was evaluated by a number, and that if i wasn't posting or in the loop that I was nothing. It took a toll on my confidence, and i felt like shit. 

shoot me a message if you want to talk about it. i've been off social media for practically a year now and if you maybe want to discuss how it will affect you in the long run or just to talk i'm here for you."
