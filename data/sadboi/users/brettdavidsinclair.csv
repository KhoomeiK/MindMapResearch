The first few days I felt kinda cracked out (for lack of a better explanation), spacey and out of it - I knew it was just initial side effects but I felt nearly no depression or anxiety. I was on 5mg. Per my Dr. I upped the dose to 10mg after 4 days and my depression got worse. Was sleeping all day and all night for like 2-3 days - could barely work. And then today, I feel... clearer. I don’t really feel any emotion tbh. But I’m still a little depressed. Anxiety is pretty much gone. Can’t really give a conclusion on it yet I guess.

What a ride! Trying to stick with it. Everyone so far has said to push through the beginning. Really hope it works out for you :)"

I think the great thing about this is that your audience can be clearly segmented by one variable - age (excluding outliers). 

I would run low cost ads on Instagram at this specific age demo in towns across the US. Maybe do some research on towns with the highest percentage of college students. You could even get more specific and target those interested in a college (I think you can do this).

I think this is a topic that a lot of kids graduating want to learn about - so user adoption could be quite simple with the right messaging and creative.

I would run some small experiments and A/B test messaging / creative with ads that drive traffic back to the download page. See what happens with conversion rates and stuff. Just an idea! Good luck.

AdultChildren,fmwo7ek,t3_fxq0vi,1586450084.0,"I’m sorry that you are going through this. Maybe some of my story will help, I hope. Apologies in advance, this quarantine is driving me insane.

From 6 to 18 I lived alone with an alcoholic mother. Her being drunk became the normal for me as well. And it was never an easy reality to deal with (I’ll spare the details - you already know them).

I’m still recovering from the trauma (I’m 24 now) and the fight is real. You have been dealt a hand that is straight up unfair. And I’ll be honest, I don’t have many helpful things to say because I’m still learning to deal with it. But what I can really say for sure is - this fight makes us some of the strongest people on the planet. If there’s anything I’ve gained from my mothers alcoholism, it’s strength. I am relentless. I am passionate and fierce. Beyond what most people can comprehend. And when I can focus all that pent up anger and sadness into something I care about, I excel.

I didn’t see light at the end of the tunnel when I was little. And still some days all I see is darkness. But when I can just get out of my head, my will to keep going is unbelievable. I get this sick enjoyment out of feeling like the world is against me, and the subsequent fight that I face every day of my life.

There is a way out. You just need to keep going. I know you are a fucking fighter. You have the strength inside of you to get through this.

Sending love. Keep your head up. You aren’t alone - I’m right there with you. PM anytime."

I became almost fully unable to take anything seriously in a social context - I was completely detached from my emotions. Because they weren’t ‘me’ right? I became blank. And everyone I interacted with - I could see and feel how unaware they were. It made it impossible for me to connect with people. About 10 years later I find myself severely dissociated and struggling immensely with depression and a loss of connection to the world. Weird stuff man.

I agree that it shouldn’t be removed, but I think it should be made optional. The fact is, Algebra 2 is pretty pointless in high school other than to satisfy some archaic requirements. I would’ve preferred to take a class that helped me develop my EQ because that’s what I’m using most in the workplace right now.

Edit: if you do end up choosing a field that requires strong mathematical comprehension, you’ll focus in on that in college. You might even have to take Algebra 1 and 2 *again* as a pre-requisite. And your performance in high school math is irrelevant at that point."
