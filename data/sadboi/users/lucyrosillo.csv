relationship_advice,f9bv3s7,t3_e3zfre,1575216557.0,"I can definitely relate to what you posted. For me in every past relationship when I felt that. Things were even just a little ‚Äúoff.‚Äù I had the urge of cheating. It got to the point that I had a boyfriend and two persons on the side. Things were extremely toxic and we just broke up because of my actions obviously. I kept having just hook ups or one night stands till I met my so. I swear that the second I saw him in rl with out us being anything at all I blocked everyone that I was talking to at the time. I do think that maybe once you meet the person you actually connect with you won‚Äôt want to jeopardize the relationship. I use to think That I loved someone even if I cheated on them.  A couple years back I could‚Äôve sworn to you that. But once I met him I knew I didn‚Äôt want to be with anyone els nor did I want to fuck up what I have with him, I hope my answer helps. Good luck on your journey though."
Monterrey,f8x0zu8,t3_e1jyzn,1574905317.0,"Con todo respeto dite a ti mismo, ""culo si no."" Tienes tres opciones una buscala en alguna red social y asegurate de tener varios amigos en comun para que no se saque tanto de pedo. Y pues agregala y trata de hablarle. Y la segunda es hablarle poco a poco, algun dia si tienes clase con ella dile que llegaste tarde y que si hubo algo importante en la clase. Si no tienes clases con ella acercate total no pierdes nada. Digamos que te dice que no pues ni modo y hicste lo que pudiste pero si te dice que si pues conseguiste lo que querias. 

Opino que si te dice que si vayan a comer a alguna parte, por un cafe o hasta por una nieve. Creo que son mejores opciones que ir a algun bar, carne asada o cine. El chiste es que puedan conocerse y platicar. 

Ya por ultimo tu tercer opcion es bajar tinder. Yo conoci a mi pareja ahi hace tiempo y nos vamos a casar ahora en Diciembre. Creo que si te da miedito y no sirve con esa muchacha esta es buena opcion porque pues empiezan con mensajes y asi es mas facil hablar con la gente cuando la vas conociendo. 

&#x200B;

Igual ojala y mi comentario te haya ayudado de algo.. Buena suerte OP!"
Monterrey,f8wzlnw,t3_e21axb,1574904240.0,"Fijate que depende cual secret santa sea. Eh visto varios que son scams. Opino que si vas a mandar algo para que no te salga caro el envio uses Amazon y pongas la direccion de la person que te toco. De esta manera no te van a querer cobrar un huevo y la mitad de otro jajaj cuando quieras mandar el paquete. Recuerdo una vez mande un carta de Monterrey a Mazatlan y como eran varios papeles me cobraron 150. Creo que si es un secret santa verificado entrale, total pues 200-300 pesos no son tantoo tantoo. Y alamejor la persona que te toque se porta bien y te manda algo que te guste. Suerte!"

BDSMAdvice,f8v0ny3,t1_f8v08x3,1574854490.0,Thats why you give your head doctor a heads up on routine checks. It‚Äôs documented. Our friends know and we have proof that everything is consensual. Police gets involved we have a lawyer who is also aware of the situation in case one day it gets out of hand. My mother is aware and so is his father. We have gone to couples therapy and have talk this out. That‚Äôs the only reason why we chose to let our closed ones know. And the therapist said that if one day it does get out of hand that it‚Äôs always good to let your lawyer know heads up. Thank you for your concern though.

It's just that I did not expect it and felt bad that I sorta went into shock and could not do much. I also felt bad for interrupting.

relationship_advice,f8ul28d,t3_e2b938,1574833070.0,"Hello Op as we all know break ups hurt. No need to talk about that. I understand why you want her to feel hurt and I congratulate you on not proceeding/taking action with that. Takes a lot of us to stop our selves when we are hurt. I think you should take more time to think about the good things of the relationship. Maybe talk to a therapist or counselor. Sometimes we feel the need to hurt our ex because we haven‚Äôt moved on and they seem to be doing better. I can assure you that no one is happy after a break up. There‚Äôs feelings involved, friendships and well the memories we keep within our selves. Try to remember the good times and learn from your experiences. Sending good wishes your way and I hope you feel better. Don‚Äôt say anything you could possibly regret and take care OP"

No one deserves to feel alone in a ‚Äúroom full of people.‚Äù I my self was surrounded by 5-10 ‚Äúgood friends.‚Äù Last year slowly I realized everyone was just around me because I would host the weekly party. (Basically just hanging out to drink at my place) As soon as I realized it I stopped having things at my place. Soon enough everyone stopped inviting me to drink whenever they would do something. (4 out of 5 times it was at my place and I would provide everything) I ended up with just one friend out of everyone that I would hang out with. Better alone that with friendships like that.

AskReddit,f8h85zi,t3_dyjyp3,1574570822.0,"I personally can‚Äôt give you a straight answer. I found your question while looking for other people‚Äôs opinions on this. I‚Äôm a 20F. My SO is M23 He had always been a vanilla type and I slowly made him a dom. (lol sounds weird?) any who I enjoy being physically beaten. I hate spanking. But I enjoy been slapped and/or being hit on the face close fist. I don‚Äôt necessarily know (I have an idea but I‚Äôm not ready to talk about it) why I enjoy being forced/used. There are times I genuinely don‚Äôt want to do something and my SO will think I‚Äôm acting. (upon my request we do not have a safe word) and afterwards when he cuddles me he realizes I really didn‚Äôt want to do something and he will feel bad and apologize. He‚Äôs a very sentimental person so I feel bad over him feeling bad simply because I didn‚Äôt express my self the way that I should‚Äôve. 

But our relationship has improved so much since we sat down and talked about how we enjoyed sex a lot. How I enjoyed being hit and how he enjoys taking control over everything. I call him daddy. Now it‚Äôs no news to me that I have daddy issues. I long for a man taking care of me the way my father should‚Äôve. I‚Äôm sorry I guess I‚Äôm going off track. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that we complimented each other and someway became stronger after we realized that other one could give us what we lacked on. He needed someone to use to feel better since he pretty much grew up with his grandparents. Mom remarried dad was in jail for more than half his life. SO needed someone who would take care of him, devote their life around him and be unconditional to him. I needed someone who would do the same thing for me. Even though I am younger than him I had been sexually active for a longer time and had already been into bdsm. Therefore I got to ‚Äúperfect things with him.‚Äù And he got to learn things from me. Eh i don‚Äôt know sorry OP it‚Äôs late and I haven‚Äôt slept since yesterday. I hope you understand a little even though I know I probably made no sense. 


There‚Äôs just something about being hit, not being able to get up, seeing your own blood run and being hit that just thinking about it makes me feel a shiver down my spine. Being fully controlled and force to do things you are not going to a hundred percent like all of the time that makes you feel useful? Idk."
JustNoSO,f8ea23d,t3_e0fagz,1574522994.0,"Congrats OP for leaving! It took a lot of abuse from my Ex to finally get out. I moved in with him in a moment of need. He started drinking, leaving me home alone all day, hitting me, cheating on me, taking my car keys so I couldn‚Äôt leave and my phone. He had bought me a dog and one day I phoned my mum and asked her to bring my spare key and wait outside for me. I then slowly started packing just the absolute necessities. I tried sneaking outside and he hit me and hit the dog. I was so mad that I bite him. I had never stood up to him and my ‚Äúmom nature‚Äù made me bite him and run out the door. Thankfully my mum had found the place and threatened to call 911 if we kept fighting. (I was very scared because even though he said ‚Äúthis is your dog‚Äù he had paid for every vaccine the pup had and more than likely had receipts/ papers were unknowingly to me under his name as well) but yeah looked back a couple times but never went back."
