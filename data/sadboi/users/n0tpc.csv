depression,fpd0ko9,t3_gckrtm,1588517225.0,I remember after a bad exam I was sort of broken and a friend hugged me. I wasn't a huggy-wuggy person but I had been so much touch starved it gave me back the floor behind my feet. It's a great tragedy of our time. There's also been a recent dread of time running out. Not much you can do other than coming to term with it.. finding some form of catharsis.
Stutter,fnz6xzi,t3_g4n0j7,1587387639.0,"I have to prove myself before a single word is spoken to be given a chance in any sort of companionship. It induces a lot of failure related anxiety, because when I do fall nobody will have the patience for me anymore. It's a nice and comfortable cope to retreat into myself and live in my head most of the time and pretend love is not for me."
Stutter,fnrv8qb,t3_g3jqkw,1587202875.0,Haha yeah being an edgelord is easier for me too. It's probably less anxious when you're knowingly saying something edgy so you don't care about the listener's approval. Meanwhile in general conversation we try to find middle ground.

never said she ""demeaned"" herself, I said she's sharing personal intimate photos to the public. Maybe the world overshares their life these days and I have a boomer mentality. He said the ""job"" fulfilled her as the rationalisation which I didn't get.

\> There is no problem other than the one that arises when you try to apply your values to his life.

Yeah. I just value his opinion that's all, gathering new info is good to improve your stance. I thought she was a normal youtuber like shoeonhead until recently."
Idubbbz,fls3yqi,t1_fls348j,1585433850.0,"\> is office work filing paperwork fulfilling?

it is not, people do it cause they don't have other choices or are trying to move up th ladder, atleast in my opinion. She isn't going broke that she has to resort to this, if that was the case I wouldn't have issues.

\> which leads me to believe it isnt just about the fulfillment.

Yes it is not I guess. In my head, it is a last resort and not something someone does out of choice. It's not art with visible genetelia, she's selling photos with intimacy. idk I do have an instinctive reaction to the situation which I wouldn't want with a long term partner. Maybe this is not a long term thing for idubbz either."

samharris,fkdw6k8,t3_fhsot3,1584097639.0,"Well, mindfulness can stabilise your mind and actually help you in the path towards your goal. But yes, it does dim the fire inside,numbs you out a certain extent and even kills the wonder of the world too. It becomes hard to convince yourself as to why you should be ambitious. Personally, most of the ""search"" was mostly mental masturbation. You don't need to grind in the rat race, but should find a race you want to win and keep trying."
