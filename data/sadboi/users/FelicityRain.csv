Advice,flzb5aa,t3_fs369y,1585619571.0,"I do the same thing anime and all... when I get out of that cycle it’s usually because I become busy with something else, like writing music or stories etc. With how things are going Ask yourself Where do you see yourself in 5 years? How about 10? Then Write down where you WANT to be. Next write down the steps to get there... If you don’t know, use your resources and explore. Example: even if it seems ridiculous is there a job that appeals to you? Write it down and continue to brainstorm/find ways to get there.
Connect with yourself spiritually too.. when is the last time you did something for someone else? Is there anyone who you could serve? When is the last time you prayed/meditated? If you believe in a higher power or even feel there could be one, take time to pray for guidance, build a relationship with god, study scripture/and meditate on your feelings... do something different you haven’t done before. there’s not harm in this and it can help you connect with your “deeper/spiritual” self. 
Maybe do yoga, or workout. 

It doesn’t matter what cycle you are in, Getting out of one takes action and effort. If you are willing to put fourth that effort you can change. If not, you won’t.


Edit: I took my own advice and now I’m doing something crazy that I thought was irrational and I love it: I’m studying a bachelors degree in opera performance and afterwards I’m going to get a after degree in education to be a school teacher... but like... opera... when I came up with the idea I thought I was mad...

Advice,flz620p,t3_fs2hfb,1585616315.0,"I was cheated on by my ex over a year ago. I would never take him back. It’s harsh, I still love him very much and I always will, but I know I wouldn’t be happy with him anymore. I would always feel inadequate/like he would just leave again. I’ve moved on, I’ve dated have found great guys. I don’t regret the time I was my ex’s girlfriend, but at the end of the day there are guys out there who will value me more. 
Now as for your friend, honestly he should regret his actions, but he shouldn’t expect her to take him back. She might forgive him, but even that may not mean she’ll trust him. She may love him, but he broke her. If she takes him back I really hope they are happy and that they both grow from this. But at the end of the day there are lines that shouldn’t be crossed, and consequences that are painful and often permanent. If he’s actually changed then he will never ever hurt her or anyone like this again.

Edit: Sorry I feel like this wasn’t helpful, but coming from a girl that this happened too, this may be how his ex is feeling. 
Good luck though, I really do hope he finds happiness, whether it’s with her, or someone else."

Advice,flz318i,t3_fs2ghx,1585614436.0,"It’s good that you are here for her, I know she appreciates it... I think the first thing to do is to find a way that she can talk to her mum about it, giving birth is a big deal, and if her mum could give her support that would be best.. if you are worried about that then I’d take her to a professional councillor so she can figure out a plan to bring up the subject/find her next step. Remember If she decides to carry the baby to full term there are options for them both. The last thing you want to do is make her feel backed in a corner and that she has no choice but to abort the child. So be supportive, listen to her, help her connect with a supportive professional and try not to despair, she’ll need you to help her know things will work out. You got this! 
If she is spiritual or religious in anyway don’t forget to encourage her connecting with those aspects of her life too. It can be very helpful to pray/meditate, even if she’s not and she’s open to, it can boost metal health, and help her connect with her own feelings. And there’s no harm in giving it a try, Good luck!"

I get it, I still struggle with depression, anxiety and ptsd.. I'm 23 but i've been struggling with some of those things since grade nine. No matter how difficult things get though, know that you are worth fighting for, and if others don't validate you, then you need to do it yourself. When you struggle, when you are weak and feel like you can't keep moving forward, remember you are of great worth. Struggling, leads to strength, and you will be able find more compassion for others who struggle with mental illness.

The best distraction for me has been to find ways to serve and help others. I'm not the best at it, but I realized the more focus I personally have on helping others, the less I am pulled down... sometimes this is just giving a smile, and other days when I can't do that I end up curled in a ball and just crying and praying but when I can get myself to do even that much, it ends up being enough... not that I'm perfect at this either... my point is, remember you're worth fighting for, and I don't know if you believe in God, but for myself I know that he is aware of you, and he loves you... sorry i didn't mean to preach, or get too much into my own details... it just really sucks when people pull you down, and no one deserves that.

Edit: I realized this made me sound too much like an angel when depressed.. aha if you need heavy metal, or intense stories, or whatever to also de-stress that's totally normal too... at least I think it is, cause I also use these things. but my point is those other things seem to work best when I can make myself do them..."
