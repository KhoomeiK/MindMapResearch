If the people relate to your father are not ready to understand you in your efforts, they do not deserve that you continue to have a relationship with them.  

Sorry for what you have experienced, but you realize this very young and to have a very supportive mother is big advantage for you. You have a long way ahead of you and not talking to people who have hurt you is, in my opinion, a very good first step.  

Take care."

See how he can advise you?  For your parents, I don't know them, but from experience, if a parent really loves you, they will do their best to understand and help you.  If your boss is a piece of shit, do your best to focus on your work, your colleagues, and what can be positive. If it's too much for you, do your best to change jobs? What field are you working in?

 First, try your best not to hide your anxiety. Keeping these negative emotions is overly harmful and can be even more harmful in the long run. Even if those around you do not always understand, maybe try to find progressive ways to talk about it? Try to 'liberate' this evil with something you love to do? Drawing? Sport ? Read? I dont know? Also, it's ood if you had good social life! Try to keep with that. If they are real friend, they will understand that it is very difficult what you live. If some of your friends deny your anxiety, don't seek their help. 

Out of curiosity, how old are you? I'm just asking to find out what kind of resources you need. Regarding your work, is it only your boss that makes you feel bad? Do you like your job anyway? Your colleagues ?  I don't really have miracle tricks, but honestly, i think it's really important to change the way you see yourself. You are not pathetic. You have the right to experience negative emotions no matter the reason."

Taking anti-depressants can be scary and I totally understand if you are, but if you've tried other things to make yourself feel good and you've been hanging out with depression for years, there's nothing wrong with starting with them.

  Make sure you have a good listening doctor who doesn't give you whatever he want, share how you feel and ask questions and everything should be ok!  Also, I think it is essential to continue the therapy even with anti-depressants"

Also, divorce procedures can be stressful even in healthy relationships, so don't blame yourself for feeling anxious. Do you have people to accompany you in the procedures?  You say you've always been the kind of person who planned out the future . I think a good accomplishment you can ''planned'' is to see yourself well and happy in the future (if this make sense?).

 To be honest, in a situation like this, people's opinions don't count and if they don't understand, you don't need them in your life. It's easier said than done obviously ...  Maybe if it's too difficult for you to erase your Facebook you can just not go over it without erasing all? You can erase it once you may have found a more feasible solution or when you feel ready.  Another point that may seem rough, but it is definitely in situations like this that we realize who are the people who care most about us. If your family doesn't love you and there is nothing you can do about it, then is it really going to change anything if you erase your Facebook? Is your relationship going or can it get better if you keep it?  Regarding your friends, I'm sure they will understand. No one in their right mind (rationally), can be upset about a friend who erases his Facebook for the reasons you said.  I hope it makes sense!  Take care :)"

What I can tell you from experience is that once you are going to have experienced several things and will have more control over your life, things will surely seem less worse to you (maybe im wrong, but this is what i experienced).   


 Also, this may be a detail, but don't forget to congratulate yourself and recognize your good moves when you're terrified. It may be difficult not to focus on what scares you, but if you are able to see the good shots in the long run, you will be able to overcome everything! :) Take care!"

You do not like your job and it brings you too much anxiety? Just quit, like for real. If you absolutely need a job, I will advise you to make a plan B before. 

 Dont be to hard on yourself. People will often expect  you to learn fast and perform, especially in a workplace. Even the most competent and fast person may not like to have pressure and this can lead to negative experience.  From what you say about your work, even if you do everything perfectly, it seems like a very ''anxiety environment'', I think it's important to be aware of that.

First, the fact that you are listening to her and your family is open about this problem is already a giant step because she is not alone in this . I think that one of the first steps would be to consult a therapist to understand the  nature of her anxiety problem.  I think it's essential to see where the physical pain relate to anxiety came from and to do this, the help of a therapist is crucial. Once the problem is known, the best you can do is continue to listen to her and be there for her the best as you can has a sister!  You look like  an awsome sibling and i hope your siste will get better ! :)"
Anxiety,f7n0x2p,t3_dx23my,1573880079.0," I think your best option is probably online? I do not know how it works where you live, but to find a roommate, I often go to  Facebook groups for exemple where people give descriptions of them. If you know this kind of group, it can surely be useful to find someone you think is good. 

 If not, try to see in your entourage the friend of a friend whom you can trust?"
relationship_advice,f7n077s,t3_dx28ir,1573879347.0,"I was exactly in the same situation with my girlfriend 3 years ago, we have been together for 4 years.

The description you make of yourself is about the same as my girlfriend. To be honest, it was very hard for me to understand these difficulties and even more difficult to understand why she breaks up with me and came back after. However, I loved her more than anything and she knew these mistakes and wanted to improve,  as you seem to want it too . She left me about every month for 6-7 months. The first and second time, I was very hurt, but I quickly realized that it was negative reactions from him and that everything was going to get better and more important, i trust her. Also,  his jokes were surely out of place, but I'm sure it was not in a mean way. 

Trust is something that develops in the long run. The things that you have experienced in your past will quietly dissipate more than your relationship will advance with your boyfriend. It's important that you continue to communicate as much as you can about how you  both feel about the whole situation.    If your boyfriend is ready to get involved with you for long terme, understand your past and help you, you will definitely get there together. It's important, though, that you think about how he feel about that aswell! I wish you both the best. :)

Anxiety,f7mvhab,t3_dx1f2l,1573874997.0," I totally understand the financial difficulties, but it's really important to respect your limits, especially when you're anxious. I'm sure you have all the good intentions with your friends, but if you're exhausted of it, I'm sure they can understand. I'm not saying that you should not help them at all, but try to help them as best as you can, but by respecting yourself.  Make priorities, the first should definitely be you. But im glad for you that your boyfriend feel better and hope him, your friends and you the best! :)"
Anxiety,f7mu1j4,t3_dwtymw,1573873715.0,"I feel exactly the same way. When I'm in a place where there's a chance to meet someone I know, I'm looking straight ahead to make sure I meet no one. I always find excuses not to go into social events because I know that my anxiety will ruin how I will interact with people. I absolutely calculate all in many situations to minimize my social interactions. That's pretty bad, I know it, but it's too difficult."
Anxiety,f7mts77,t3_dx18nl,1573873481.0," I'm glad you're able to go out with your friends for theirs birthday :) I do not know what youve been thought, but I'm convinced that you probably have a long story to be where you at right now and you have have every reason to be confident . It may take a long time before this negative feeling that something is going  to happen go away, but it is by continuing to work on yourself that you will not feel it anymore. Take care!"
toastme,f7mtbzn,t3_dwzfdj,1573873094.0, Happy Birthday :) I'm sure if you're celebrating alone it's definitely not your fault. Too many people are blind to the people around them and I'm sure they miss a great opportunity to not know you!

KSIvsLoganPaul,f6xrm7o,t3_dtnbj2,1573256578.0,"Without a doubt team KSI, but this is soooooooooo difficult to know who's gonna win. 

Yes, Logan had some advantage that KSI don't have. 

But in the other hand, I'm pretty sure KSI team prepared him for everything. Yes, Logan coach is technically ''better'', but is like an IQ (Vidal) vs STRENGHT (Briggs) things. Both are very important and can play some major parts (in my opinion IQ is more important, but anyway). I think also a major point is forgetting about both teams, is that Jeff trained Briggs, so he probably know a lot of things that can be crucial for JJ. Logan's not Briggs, but you get my point. Also,  Logan cardio probably improves a lot, but I'm sure JJ's one still better. I think Logan will try to rush JJ way too hard knowing that he can K.O him in the first/second round, but JJ defense will be on point. Knowing that, if JJ make any mistake, it will be more fatal than Logan. But once he will be in '' Logan zone'', it will be over for Logan. So yeah, there's much that can happen, but JJ is underestimated in this for sure."
