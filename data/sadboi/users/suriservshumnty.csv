Before this when I lost my job and housing I thought of staying with them temp. Instead I stayed with my friend, shared a bed with him in this tiny studio with 2 dogs in the ghetto of north philly (hes a gay and white, I'm blonde and white) lol.

I shut off tv, or do a mental excercise where I try to disconnect myself and vision this black block covering my mind and the potential flashback, I rant on reddit and guess just ride it out, if my therapist brings it up (I'm not ready to talk about it that much with her, yet) then I quickly change the subject and mentally focus on something else and it hurts my brain to do so and again.. disconnect. It's tough because a lot of people into like daddydom/little girl role play are sexual abuse survivors, but there is controversy as if it heals your wounds? But again it can easily become addicting. Then if you ask a lot of pornstars, a lot of them were sexually abused as children. It's like they are high functioning and used a way to deal with their trauma in the present, but I dont think they ever truly heal besides what's on the surface. EDIT- I just remembered another trigger. I was staying with my gay guy friend in this extremely small studio. He got drunk, (hes narcisstic) and started defending R Kelly and talking shit on girls just wanting money, then he straight up BLASTED R Kelly music and it just took up the whole studio and I quickly packed up my things and ubers to the train station where one of my friends paid for an uber all the way to her house to stay.

Example, with sexual abuse there are pedaphile and traumatized people.

Now, I'm a writer..... I believe that PTSD and deadlines in school are a trigger which sucks cause it prevents you from doing it. If you can get an accomodation and an extension on your time it lifts weights off your shoulder and uncovers your brain. If this helps, try to write like you speak and relate it to your life or what interests you most to make it fun.

In therapy a big thing was inner mothering myself through tough times, but it was all in my head or talking to myself through writing as if it's a mother talking to me. So with my pup, its more outward. My therapist brings up often, i should be just as kind and loving to myself as I am with my puppy. Sometimes that is a worry of mine, losing myself in others. Before her, my purpose and what kept me going was goals and always having to do all these great things. But now I'm very happy just... being.... with her. That's fulfilling me. Maybe before I was chasing and seeking something to fulfill me, thinking love couldn't do that and only success could, accepting my life just wouldnt be filled with relationships and so I focused on having a career to be my life. But now I have her. It's just so weird to think what I would be like without her. But I think slowly I heal myself through how I treat her. It's odd cause I will still let my anxiety take over me, and look to reddit at times as if I need motherly advice or validation, when I already know the answer.

I have a lot of my own beliefs, like I see life as a very magical thing.

Once I raised my voice at her, just sternly, and picked her up and brought her inside. I talked about this with my therapist for 40 min and she laughed telling me stories about her dog being a little fucker, and what I did wasnt even bad. But then it goes back to like, my dad abused us disguised as ""discipline."" But my mom had no rules and had no awareness whatsoever. So it's like ok, I cant be a push over, cause it's a parent or owners job to guide and teach them the right things and what we want from them. Reacting with anger isnt right, not reacting at all isnt right, but reacting in a positive and constructive way is right I believe. Idk I take this shit super seriously lol.

I judge in a way (this is bad, but being homest) where if they are TOO open about it, then they dont have a very severe case, or they dont have it as bad as I do. It sounds petty to compare and I know you should never do that, but that's how I feel. And I feel if I were to openly share it to others they would assume I'm lying, or want attention, or not REALLY get the full, complex, extent of it all. I come off very different on the outside and if I was open, it would be a whole case of Cognitive Dissonance. My abusive ex bf would always gaslight me. If I was present and standing up for myself, then he would say oh I'm a tough girl now, I'm faking it, I'm manipulative. And if I showed my vulnerability or was going through a sick PTSD flare, he would make fun of me that I'm the victim, cant do anything, and bring up certain abuse saying it didnt effect me or something.

I only had my B.S in psychology and was like great, cant get a job unless I have my masters completed. So I thought if I dont have that, yet, I need some form of experience or connection to supplement it. So I applied for internships and emailed clinics directly asking.

I mean I guess I understand the whole misconception it's the best of both worlds or to have 2 awesome breeds in 1 but like you said, you never know what you're getting. Like that would suck if you got a doodle because you're allergic to dogs and it ended up not being hypoallergenic. The original breeder of doodles said it was his biggest life regret in an article. They're so trendy now and everywhere! But it makes poodles more magical I think because they're so rare. Shes my first dog so I'm new to all this stuff. But I do like how poodles have their own unique quirks and temperament that they all generally have in common with another. But like I said a lot of breeders in these standard poodle Facebook groups are very very passionate about this stuff and doodles are such a touchy subject. Now I understand why. They want to preserve the best traits of this magical breed and not get them mixed away.. I also dont understand if doodles are said to be misbehaved because of their genes and mixed temperament or because their owners don't train them to behave? It seems like they get a bad wrap"

 ‚ÄúA breeder  of a purebred dog is really a kind of artist,‚Äù David Frei, a former  co-host of the Westminster Kennel Club dog show, told [Bloomberg News]‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to create a work of art that shows all the best traits of a particular breed.‚Äù

Designer breeders are ‚Äúlooking for the moneymaking venture,‚Äù another critic told Bloomberg News. The labradoodle set off an intense interest in ‚Äúdesigner dogs,‚Äù which  started to fetch prices beyond those of their purebred parents. The breeder got the idea to rebrand them, from a  ‚Äúcrossbreed‚Äù to a new kind of nonallergenic dog with the quirky name  ‚Äúlabradoodle.‚Äù ‚ÄúCan you get onto the media and tell them that we‚Äôve bred a special breed?‚Äù Conron recalled.

I thought the same, like standard poodles seem more designer. Labradoodles seem more of a pet, or like for people that cant afford poodles, and everyone loves a good lab so it's like the best of both worlds. I feel like everyoneeee has them, or goldendoodles these days. Even my breeder was talking shit on them when I first got my girl calling them ugly, but there not?

As soon as I shut my nights off for bed around 9ish, she goes out into the kitchen and makes as much noise as possible in the kitchen. My room's door is in the kitchen and I leave it open for my dog. She has someone on fucking speaker phone while doing this! Then goes back to her room and fucking hums and sings. The humming that people do when they are listening to music and dont realize they are doing it or how loud or that everyone can fucking hear it. It urks this shit out of me!!! I hate noise and it's like as soon as I'm finally ready to relax it begins... the walls are paper thin here too. She also will randomly start cleaning and moving furniture at 3am.

badroommates,fpeyt59,t3_gb8i1v,1588557891.0,"This happened to me in the 7th grade with a girl who stole clothes every time she came over, leading up to 3 trash bags total (gradually) + more I'll never get back. My memory is a little blurry but basically she would go to my room to ""change"" to go swimming in my pool. I was always an awkward friend so never wanted to be up there with her. I noticed she would take a while but secretly liked having a short break from her. One time i went to get money for pizza and it was gone, i started crying and freaking out.. thinking my brothers stole it without saying it. Then I could just tell, by her body language, and she quickly offered me cash. The same amount that was gone. It was the first day of school and I just remember opening my closet and seeing more hangers. Then I'd vision something I'd want to wear and not be able to find it. And then I would think of more things and they werent there. A majority of my clothes were gone. I forget how I confronted the girl, but it was nice at first cause I felt embaressed for her. I asked specifically if she had a shirt I might have lent her or something and whence she admitted to it, I knew she took so much stuff. I kept asking for article by article. Then I got angry, and said she stole my stuff without asking, finally getting a backbone. My mom had to show up at her house for the clothes. She went in the room with the girls dad and grandmom and took out 3 tradhbags of my stuff. My mom was shocked and even she is crazy. The parents were confused that she would do that and that apparently I let her borrow all of them. We showed up unannounced so she couldnt run and she was in the ""shower"" the entire time. I still missed a few of my favorite shirts :( it was beyond bizzarre"
Depersonalization,fpe6xkm,t3_gcwhnf,1588541574.0,"I had a near death experience when I was 16 because this happened to my friend while she was driving with me in passenger seat. We were hotboxing and on our second blunt of strong ass weed. We were driving into town, and there was a red light ahead with cars in front of us piling up as they all stopped one by one. I noticed she was going kinda fast and not slowing down and said something to her. Her eyes were open but she wasnt responding or moving. I started screaming and panicking. Then she snapped out of it for a split second and spoke. Then her foot went on the petal and she was speeding, again into the line of cars. I was screaming and shaking her and ended up getting ontop of her and steering the car off the road and into an abandoned parking lot. Her foot was still on the petal, I just had the steering wheel. And so we were heading straight for a brick wall of a building. My life flashed before my eyes... and it all happened so fast.... but then the car just.... stopped.... Turns out all the tires in the car popped cause we flew over a curb between.2 telephone poles which made it stop but it was like a blessing.. like it wasnt my time. I ran to the other side and started shaking her. She was like in a coma. She slept for hours after that and felt weird and sick for days and days. I never drove with her again, she never smoked again. She still cant describe what happened . She said she could hear me but couldnt move."
HealthAnxiety,fpdj7yf,t3_gcjtpg,1588528058.0,"Growing up my cousin had cancer, he was as young as 10 years out when I found out, I was maybe 6? At easter I'd see him with no hair but he was so happy like other kids. It made me feel so out of control, like it could happen to anyone. My uncle, my dads sister married was diagnosed with cancer at 16 when she met him. He recovered, then got it again, and is recovered again today. My best friend in the 2nd grader's dad got cancer and went through chemo. He survived too. I was so young and just wanted to know why? How does this happen to random people? To make things worse, I was a picky eater as a child. I preferred bread, cheese, fruit. My dad always said I'd get cancer if I kept eating so much bread and cheese. So I stopped eating all together. I developed OCD with a belief that if I did these rituals with every hand wash, and every time I switch the light or shut a door- it would prevent me from getting sick. And if I messed it up, I'd do it all over, cause I literally, fully, 100% believed this would control it. Anything to control it. Later in young adulthood I got an eating disorder and still today obsess over ingredients in things. When I see a list on a box I get very overwhelmed and end up not eating at all. Or I say fuck it and eat it anyways, then hate myself because I think I ruined my body and now it's too late. I know why I am this way which helps but it clouds my perception and is stronger than me sometimes. I feel so much for you."

On the 4th she messaged me and said she is waiting for the landlord to look over the papers and asked when I want to move in. On the 5th she messaged me saying her landlord needed another copy of the signed lease in a different format. And I sent them again. On the 7th she said she still hasnt heard back from the landlord. So there was all sorts of issues with the documents. But my argument is that regardless, she couldn't deliver me the premises because of the paperwork mess. The lease doesnt state if the delay is my fault. It is both faults and confusion. It just says if she cant deliver the premises on that date and if such a delay occurs I am not liable to pay for those days. Her landlord took a few days to respond and she was waiting for her landlord to give her the ok which she didnt even get as of the 7th. She stated whence the paperwork is in and I pay, the room is ready. Her argument is it was ready the 1st.

Its hard to accept. But, if your parents are allowing them to act this way, they will continue to act this way. Even if they are clearly distressed, if they arent taking any steps to stop it, then this cycle is going to continue and continue and continue. You are not their parents or responsible for them. And you cant change your parents. And you cant change your siblings or have them get their own help they clearly need as well. It seems you're caught in a dysfunctional family. The only thing you can change is yourself in this situation, separate yourself from this dysfunction.
