That's the same amount of energy consumed by running a central air conditioning unit per hour. Central air takes 3.5-4 KW/H to operate.

So now, somehow, having all the households in America is supposed to 1) even be possible considering California already experiences brownouts in the summer and 2) more environmentally friendly than driving, considering adding 200 million lead-acid batteries into the economy, as well as everyone essentially leaving their central air conditioner running for an extra hour every night (to charge the golf cart).

The big breakthroughs for me were the slicers that allow the user to pick which measures they want to display (which I couldn't find any tutorial for doing online. I had to figure it out myself), and the timeframe (N weeks back, which I did find a tutorial for online) they want to see. 

The first screenshot is showing a raw data vs. goal data in the bar/line graph (the gray ones) with a 21-day simple moving average of both measures (the colored lines) overlaying the raw data. The values aren't really important here, because what I'm trying to emphasize is the relationship between the moving averages. Our day-to-day data is quite noisy (I work in custom fabrication), so the 21-day moving average is the best way I've found to filter the noise and reveal the true signal.

The second screenshot is where the user can compare any of the 4 moving averages to each other using the slicer. Some of these comparisons hadn't been done before and have been very useful for adjusting our goals.

The third screenshot is where the goal is the ""zero line"" and the graphed value is a percentage above or below the goal, but where I'm comparing the moving averages.

For my data, I ran it this way for 2-3 months, then I would change the date range of the static to include the most recent 3 months, manually update it, then move the date for the recent table to match.

PowerBI,fgme5jf,t3_ezbsh8,1580922782.0,"I do this as well. We have Rolling 12 Weeks, Complete Weeks Only in one chart, but I also do rolling 30 days by day in a separate chart, so they can see most recent performance.

I do it in the date table itself, rather than in the measure. That way, I can just have one measure and throw whatever time filter I want on it, and not have to have separate measures for every time frame I want.

So these are custom columns in my date table, and I just drag the desired one to my report page and set it to True, and the chart gets filtered appropriately.

I'll give you Rolling 12 Weeks (current week included) and I'll give you Rolling Complete 12 Weeks, And I'll also give you Rolling 52 Complete Weeks. You can modify these as you need.

    Rolling 12 Weeks =
    IF (
        'Calendar'[DATE] < TODAY ()
            && 'Calendar'[DATE]
                >= TODAY () - 84,
        TRUE (),
        FALSE ()
    )
    
    Rolling Complete 12 Weeks =
    IF (
        [DATE]
            >= (
                TODAY ()
                    + (
                        7 - WEEKDAY ( TODAY (), 2 ) - 90
                    )
            )
            && [DATE]
                <= TODAY ()
                    + ( 7 - WEEKDAY ( TODAY (), 2 ) ) - 7,
        TRUE (),
        FALSE ()
    )
    
    Rolling 52 Weeks =
    AND ( [DATE] <= TODAY () - 1, [DATE] >= TODAY () - 365 )

Something to note: the complete weeks measure is built assuming week-ending on Sunday, because our calendar goes Mon-Sun. If you are Sun-Sat, the measure would look like this:

    Rolling Complete 12 Weeks =
    IF (
        [DATE]
            >= (
                TODAY ()
                    + (
                        7 - WEEKDAY ( TODAY ()) - 90
                    )
            )
            && [DATE]
                <= TODAY ()
                    + ( 7 - WEEKDAY ( TODAY () ) ) - 7,
        TRUE (),
        FALSE ()
    )

As for complete months, I'd do it like this, as a calculated column in my calendar:

    Rolling Complete 12 Months =
    IF (
        [DATE] <= EOMONTH ( TODAY (), -1 )
            && [DATE] > EOMONTH ( TODAY (), -13 ),
        TRUE (),
        FALSE ()
    )"

PowerBI,fgiqk38,t3_expwgr,1580828653.0,"I usually replace the default tooltip with a custom one where the colors match the graph I'm mousing over. One handy trick I've been using lately is to use custom formatting on the measure in the card to match the background color if the value is blank. That way, the card is empty instead of saying (blank) on the card. Looks much nicer.

I love that you can have graphs on the custom tooltip as well. I have a few reports that have two values being compared in a bar graph, with a ratio as a percentage as a line. 

With custom tooltips, when they mouse over, I use a circle graph with the two values, and the ratio as a percentage in the middle of the circle graph. Looks really nice."
PowerBI,fginu9l,t3_eyqkqx,1580826781.0,"I work in a fabrication shop, and we have adopted Power BI in a big way. However, we do not have computers or even television screens in our shop at a team level. We have bulletin boards. That means every morning my supervisors are reviewing the reports, then going through the painful process of printing them page by page.

We're not using paginated reports right now. I'm not talking about those. I'm talking about reports straight out of Power BI. 

We have run into all kinds of problems printing. Currently, we have to use Chrome, and scale the pages to 47% to get them to print semi-decently in landscape format. 

Another issue is with color. White text in the desktop app will convert to black if it's in a text box, but if it's in a card, it does not. So if I want to do a dark theme report, I have to make all of my cards a neutral gray text, which doesn't look good on screen nor on paper.

**TL;DR:** Printing in Power BI is filled with pain and tedious repetition, with no good solutions and no relief to be found on the roadmap. I don't think we're the only shop that needs or prefers to print reports. Can you give me any hope things will improve any time soon?"

PowerBI,ffqofcx,t3_eunheg,1580139877.0,"I'll offer an alternative way to doing it: Make a calculated column called Workday. Here's the formula (assuming your workweek starts on Sunday):

    Workday =
    IF (
        WEEKDAY ( SalesTable[SalesDateColumn] ) >= 2
            && WEEKDAY ( SalesTable[SalesDateColumn] ) <= 6,
        TRUE (),
        FALSE ()
    )

This will act as a filter column for the ""Last Workday Sales"" measure:

    Last Workday Sales :=
    VAR LastSalesDay =
        CALCULATE ( MAX ( Salestable[SalesDateColumn] ), SalesTable[Workday] = TRUE () )
    RETURN
        CALCULATE ( [Sales], LastSalesDay )

This way, it will work even if, for some reason you don't refresh your data for a day or two. It will always give you the sales amount for the last workday in your sales table.

BTW, if your workweek starts goes from Mon-Sun (like mine does), your Workday column would look like this:

    Workday =
    IF (
        WEEKDAY ( SalesTable[SalesDateColumn], 2 ) >= 1
            && WEEKDAY ( SalesTable[SalesDateColumn], 2 ) <= 5,
        TRUE (),
