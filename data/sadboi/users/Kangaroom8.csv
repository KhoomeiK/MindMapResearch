BPD,fjzmmoy,t1_fjww6mi,1583723403.0,"I recently purchased The Dialectical Behaviour Therapy Skills Workbook. It has already given me some tools such as a distraction plan that has been helpful. You can download it for free too!

Also sane.org has a free counselling chat that I have used a couple of times to work through a few rigid thought processes.

EDIT: words"
BPD,fjwt562,t3_ff7ic1,1583645183.0,"I’ve been with my SO for just over 4 years and we got engaged a few weeks ago. The BPD is a recent diagnosis and having her there researching with me and helping recognise certain patterns of behaviours and thought patterns like splitting has actually really helped. Being open and honest and viewing it as something that can be helped through therapy and developing tools and skills to help lesson the suffering. 

One thing I will say is that unless you actively become aware of your triggers or behaviour and put things in place to help, then you aren’t helping yourself or your partner. But if she can see you’re trying, and if she’s worth it, she’ll most likely be supportive. 

Terribly written, but I hope this helps?"
BPD,fjn3p4g,t1_fjn2kx8,1583496797.0,"Wow, that was incredibly well put. 

When you spoke about stopping a wounded mind from bleeding it really fit hard. I’ve always felt like I had some kind of spiritual wound. 


Thank you"
BPD,fjn2nzj,t3_fec418,1583495698.0,"You’re not a lost cause, you’re in intense pain. And the things you’re doing are things that undeniably helped you cope with the pain. These are very hard to stop or replace. I feel very similar a lot of the time. What’s the damn point if I’m still miserable. But when I look back, even with my relapses and negative coping skills, I’m still far stronger than I was within myself. Every millimetre forward is still a very positive thing. Hell, even standing still is fine. Although I fail often, i try and only think about the next 24h and on really bad days just the next five minutes. 

Feel free to PM me if you need to talk to someone. We have your back."

cleaningbusiness,f4iwnox,t1_f4h6nry,1571610151.0,We have found it works great on all surfaces so long as the bag and filters are cleaned out at least once per week. The suction power is incredible! It also has a blowing function which can be great for paths etc.
