mentalillness,fpf5adq,t3_gcszpe,1588562126.0,"Dude-yes. Over time I have found contributing factors, like not having had food, too much noise/stimulation, my attention being drawn in too many directions, too many quick changes in environment, or even just not enough water. I am totally guilty of snapping and then realizing I haven't eaten and feeling like a dick."

mentalillness,fp39b7r,t3_gax4qh,1588275337.0,"Oh babe, I think you know. You know this was wrong. I get it, I also shrugged things off at that age and downplayed them. But it hurt, he did you wrong, and that shouldn't happen to people. That is absolutely sexual abuse. I'm sorry that was your experience. I had a similar experience and i didnt grow to enjoy ""intamacy"" until I was MUCH older, in a secure relationship, and with a lot of work. It was scary and hard for years. Someone who cares about you does not want to hurt you."

mentalillness,fp0ltfi,t3_gagw3h,1588211862.0,"Oh man, my mom was like that most of my childhood. She is better now, but it took years, several hospitalizations, police involvement and a long journey of meds to keep her even keeled. Your wife needs help, and it sounds like you guys are dedicated to her being well, so that's good. It is hard to love someone with mental illness sometimes, but just keep loving her and keeping her on the path towards growth. Having mental illness is hard, her brain is literally not functioning normally. If she had diabetes she would have to carefully manage her health with a doctor help, medication and lifestyle changes, and this is no different from other chronic illnesses that way. Best wishes"
mentalillness,fovug42,t1_fovhzon,1588107714.0,"For sure! It's bad here also but I have been able to see my therapist and primary physician on teladoc type things so that's good. Maybe it's even a side effect of the meds? Idk, good luck though!! :)"

mentalillness,fovhxzh,t1_fovf7gq,1588101618.0,"I LOVE makeup so again, I'm probably biased. When I'm in a bad mood I will sometimes do myself up just for a boost. If you have some I suggest just playing dress up with it in the mirror, trying on new looks. It seems silly but I feel like as long as I have a good eyeliner I can get through anything! Lol but honestly, dont get sold on fancy stuff, you dont need expensive makeup. Go to the drugstore and find a good foundation, concealer, powder, shadow, mascara, liner. Go from there!"
mentalillness,fovhadn,t3_g9ktv1,1588101302.0,"Sounds like hardcore anxiety to me, friend! But I'm not a doctor. You should definitely see a doctor. Be open and honest, and try some meds. It's a journey to find the right ones, and I'm not going to lie, some are like gasoline on a fire. But now in my 30s I finally found a combination and dosage that helps, and I cant believe I suffered for so long unmedicated. If you had another chronic illness like diabetes, you would manage your health with your doctor and meds. Mental health is no different. It's an organ in your body malfunctioning."
stopdrinking,fovghdf,t3_g9oto3,1588100913.0,"Dude, for real. My husband is an absolute saint, but I always felt guilty about my drinking and so I always bent over backwards to be nice and cater to him and pray he didnt get sick of me and leave. Now that I am sober, I honestly expect more. I guess I created this dynamic where I felt guilty, handled EVERYTHING and then drank because I was so stressed. Cue the guilt and the cycle repeats! But now I'm kind of like wait, why am I doing everything on my own? Bless his heart- he has been working really hard to step up to the plate and handle more for me, so we will be fine. But it is an adjustment! I totally get that feeling of suddenly realizing you dont have to feel guilty. Sounds like there is a lot of anger and nastiness, maybe you guys should look into counseling? At least when your sober you *know* you dont deserve it."
mentalillness,fovf2bn,t3_g9jlnn,1588100234.0,"I had issues like that when I had very short hair, I wanted to feel more feminine! For me doing my nails helped, although I always felt kinda dumb because I'm a nail biter. Earings and makeup helped, I dont normally wear earings but it really helped me feel better. A good set of heels also goes a long way, but I love them so I'm probably biased."
stopdrinking,fop4k23,t1_fooma3g,1587952929.0,Yeah that's why I bought a pack and decided to wean down.
stopdrinking,folk2sl,t3_g815cr,1587863934.0,"I am so there! We are planning on trying this summer, but I wanted to be sober first. It's been a rough year and drinking made it 10x worse, I regret my choices so much! I am 24 hours in on quitting smoking cigarettes also and I am in a bad way wanting a smoke, but I didnt go buy any! Didnt drink, not smoking, planning on a healthy baby and healthy life. Congratulations!!"
stopdrinking,fo4agzq,t3_g5dlpq,1587500975.0,"Mixing with medications-that for me has been the biggest killer. I have been struggling with my relationship with alcohol but since I started meds I have terrible, TERRIBLE reactions. I will suddenly be so super intoxicated and ridiculous, in all my years drinking I have never had as many WTF moments as when I started meds. But ya know what? The meds help. The meds improve my life. The alcohol doesnt. So if I gotta pick between meds and drinks, I'm gonna pick meds. 
I wound up in the emergency room last week after getting accidentally blackout hammered (again, meds+drinks=nono) and hurt myself bad enough to need stitches. Being in the ER in the middle of a pandemic explaining to social workers that I'm not suicidal while they stitch my arms and legs back up was one of my lowest moments in my life. 
We are on the right side of history now- the sober side, with that behind us. We can keep it on that side. 
We can."
