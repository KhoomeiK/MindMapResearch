I just wanted everything to stop, the argument, the screaming, the tormenting, the crying, so I ran to the kitchen and took a knife. I stared at it for a moment and then realized I was too scared to do it. 
The second time, I was also in a fight with my mother, but I had the good sense to walk away. It was actually the talk I had with my dad that pushed me. He meant well, he told me to stop my silence treatment and talk to my mother (but at that moment it was like he told me to hurt myself). He said some other things that weren’t true, but I couldn’t contradict him because well, we’re not that close, we don’t know much about each other, of course he was gonna say something about me that wasn’t true. And my dad was trying to help, he didn’t deserve to have me lashing out at him. But that night I kept crying about the fact that my family are strangers, that they don’t know me and I don’t know them, and all the things that I felt had gone wrong in my life. At 1 point, I thought:”I’m gonna stop crying at some point, somehow it’ll stop like numerous times before. But the hurting is not gonna stop. I know I’ll be exactly at this place, again, some time in the future. Then what’s the point, why not end it now? If the pain is so great, why not put an end to it instead of putting myself through it again and again?” So I smashed some glasses and took a shattered piece. Again, I couldn’t do it. Couldn’t even draw some blood. I felt disgusted with myself, because even in suicide, I was a coward. Then I thought:”If I can’t kill myself, I might as well live”.
But the thought of killing myself won’t go away. And nowadays it takes smaller and smaller things for me to have a complete breakdown"
