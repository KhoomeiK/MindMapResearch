* Care/Harm,

* Authority/Subversion, 

* Sanctity/Degradation, 

and a sixth one which has not been found to be as universal as the first five which is Liberty -vs- Oppression. 

The sixth one is complicated but, to summarize, right-wing libertarians; i.e., American-style libertarians, tend to base their *entire* morality on Liberty/Oppression but only as a personal value rather than as a universal value while left-libertarians hold Liberty/Oppression as being universally applicable (in addition to the Big 5 Moral foundations)."
