television,fqx64yf,t1_fqx0yxx,1589726660.0,"I don't think it would be impossible to achieve, but I do think that almost every effort has been flawed so far, for a myriad of reasons, but one big one is that so far almost all the trans representation in media has completely lacked the input of trans men and women, (and non binary individuals tend to only be treated seriously when they are not human, which is a whole other convo.)

If such a plot were to be approached now, like in a serious way, not ""man-in-dress"" punchline, it would greatly benefit everyone involved to include people who are part of the trans community from the beginning and to continue with the unfolding of that particular plot. When you have a US Army  Vet character, you should to have actual veterans involved in the project. From writing to wardrobe to casting to rehearsal, etc. Reckon it would be harder to pitch transphobic jokes whilst sitting across the table from one or more transgender people, in the same way pitching a racist joke in a room full of people of varying colors would not likely go well. 

Also, there are so many transgender actors and actresses who could fill trans roles, which is an easy way of dodging one of the biggest criticisms studios face. They claim this character is not a man in a dress, and then actively put a man in a dress to portray that character."

These programs are available to children in houses that are eligible for other public assistance programs like food stamps, public housing, etc. 

For families that have health insurance, children are dependents on the parent's plan and the parents are billed for their treatment.

However, there are a crazy amount of really very poor families that make a few hundred or thousand dollars a year more than the maximum income for public assistance programs, which themselves are criminally underfunded, and these family exist in a grey area where they cannot afford insurance and are billed the full amount as uninsured patients.

It's all super complicated. The government cannot legally haggle prices, while the insurance companies can tell a doctor or hospital what they are willing to pay for a service and since most insured patients are themselves a paycheck or two away from financial distaster and won't be able to pay what the insurance refuses to, so the hospital pitches way high prices, hoping to get what actually need once the insurance haggles down the bill. The issue is these prehaggled prices arebcharged uniformly across every patient, regardless of insurance coverage. Sprinkle in that every single insurance company has their own rules and formalities and each of those companies have multiple plans with different levels of coverage. Add on that there is no set price list for any hospital or for any procedure anywhere in the US, and that kind of information is not publicly available, period. In fact, most patients won't know what they owe, until after their procedure. 

It is so much more complicated than this. I do it no justice.

Its bullshit.

Tldr.     Children and minors are rarely held personally accountable for their medical bills, but their treatment is not free by any means. If a child is dying, they will get care, but whoever is legally responsible for that child is responsible for the cost of their care."

According to the Torah, the kingdoms of Sodom and Gomorrah were allied with the cities of Admah, Zeboim, and Bela. These five cities, also known as the ""cities of the plain"" (from Genesis in the King James Version), were situated on the Jordan River plain in the southern region of the land of Canaan. The plain was compared to the garden of Eden[Gen.13:10] as being well-watered and green, suitable for grazing livestock. 

Divine judgment was passed upon them and four of them were consumed by fire and brimstone.  Neighboring Zoar (Bela) was the only city to be spared.

 In Abrahamic religions, Sodom and Gomorrah have become synonymous with impenitent sin, and their fall with a proverbial manifestation of divine retribution.[Jude 1:7]
Sodom and Gomorrah have been used historically and in modern discourse as metaphors for homosexuality, and are the origin of the English words, sodomite, a pejorative term for male homosexuals, and sodomy, which is used in a legal context under the label ""crimes against nature"" to describe anal or oral sex (particularly homosexual) and bestiality.  This is based upon exegesis of the biblical text interpreting divine judgement upon Sodom and Gomorrah as punishment for the sin of homosexual sex, though contemporary scholars dispute this interpretation."
