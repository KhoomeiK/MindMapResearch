Best advice my father gave me: Nothing is ever as bad or as good as you think it is.

The depressive mindset thinks everything is as bad or worse than you think, the positive mindset is the contrary."

depression,ew5bm7p,t1_es9nre2,1565132325.0,"Haha, this made me LOL. True though. There is a girl at work I currently like, but I know she likes someone else, fortunately I haven't let it develop into a crush or anything else as I have already learnt the futility of that. Yes I like her but I know nothing will come of it, I am almost going numb to these feelings of crushes etc.

My feelings towards this girl at work are minimal and I have learnt to keep them that way."
Poldark,evff9dx,t3_cj31an,1564494756.0,"I will say I think in the scene where you see him looking through the window in Poldark's house, a deep sense of sympathy is felt, because he sees his nemesis with everything that he doesn't have; Family and genuine caring friends , his wife, Elizabeth is dead, who he deeply cared for, and he saw his own son in Poldark's house.

He even said whats the point of having all this if he can't share it with her (Elizabeth).

A more human side shows here."

Euler's prodigious calculating abilities soon became legendary. One day, two students were trying to sum a complicated progression and disagreed over the 50th decimal place. Euler simply calculated the correct value in his head. Such achievements led the French physicist [Fran√ßois Arago](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Arago.html) to exclaim:

*He calculated without any apparent effort, just as men breathe, as eagles sustain themselves in the air.*

Another challenge given to Euler was to find four different numbers, the sum of any two of which is a perfect square. Euler produced the quartet: 18530, 38114, 45986 and 65570."
math,eo86bvb,t1_eo7fu5r,1558358572.0,"On a sleepless night, Euler calculated in his head the first six powers of all the numbers less than 20 (less than 100 in another account). And could remember the results thereafter, saying them forwards and backwards.

How much information is that to remember. How the f\*ck does one calculate 19\^7 in their head!"
