My 2nd surgery was with a specialist. There was a mixed team, I had my gynecologist surgeon and a gastrointestinal surgeon. 

Trigger warning, mental talk ahead. The 2nd surgery made the difference between me thinking ""I don't want to live if it means I'll be in pain level 8-9 at least a week every month."" to ""Wow, I'm on my period AND I'm on a holiday!!"" No pain whatsoever, no more changing my pads every 2 hours, no more cancelled plans because I'm on my period. I will be forever grateful to my surgeon for giving my life back."

I would cook for myself (not just one portion, but 2-3-4, so I had for more meals). If he wanted some (sometimes he would try stuff I cooked), he would try it and I would happily share with him. He would ""cook"" for himself (sandwiches mainly) or order food.
I had no problem with it.
He is free to make his choices.
Of course I told him several times ""You're gonna die of lung cancer or heart attack from your lifestyle"" and he'd reply ""Yeap, most likely.""
