SeriousFIFA,fjoqxeb,t1_fjo2z1h,1583533096.0,"I‚Äôm glad!! üôè And I promise you I always cheer him up when he plays haha, that‚Äôs one of the main reasons I subscribed to this subreddit cuz I wanted to know more about FIFA so I could help him. And we do have a pretty good time playing career mode but fut champions just turns him mad."
SeriousFIFA,fjmn3e5,t3_fe6a2c,1583475761.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry for you friend, I hope it gets better for you. It‚Äôs been only a few days so don‚Äôt be hard with you and cry as much as you need. 

On the other hand, something that really triggered me  of your story is that my boyfriend is always mad when he plays FIFA, like really mad, he screams and hates and even hit the wall once in a while because he gets so frustrated. I‚Äôve told him to stop playing for a while because I feel he‚Äôs not in his best moment right now but every weekend he comes back to play fut champions. I don‚Äôt know how to help him anymore like what could I say or do that could possibly make him feel better when he loses. I believe he is depressed, and now that I read this I‚Äôm more worried, just don‚Äôt know how to approach, he‚Äôs very closed."
