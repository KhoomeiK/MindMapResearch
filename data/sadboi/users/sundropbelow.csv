SandersForPresident,fjf59ut,t3_fd39yw,1583284602.0,Let’s go Tennessee! We need Bernie tremendously.
SandersForPresident,fjbnjlg,t3_fcfkk8,1583197323.0,"1.) Tennessee
2.) Yes
3.) Early voted a few days ago with my girlfriend.
4.) Convinced my girlfriend and her family (long time republicans) to vote for Bernie. Let’s do this everyone!"

schizoaffective,f8tvfjt,t3_e1xy4f,1574812201.0,"I tried it for about a week or two and it gave me the worst akathisia I had ever had. Constant RLS and couldn’t sleep, it was horrible. Thankfully my pdoc switched me to something that works better for me."
schizophrenia,f6uw6jr,t3_dt62xi,1573170197.0,"For me, it didn’t work as well as Abilify. Didn’t have as much akathisia with it though, but Rexulti is expensive af"
schizophrenia,f53gmpm,t3_dmjjky,1571959654.0,Good for you! I got a haircut as well not long ago after putting it aside and growing out my hair for a year and a half. Feels good now.
schizoaffective,f453lwa,t3_dijqbz,1571365257.0,"I love it. The melody is great. I really like your voice a lot too. Checked out your other songs as well, great work!"
schizoaffective,f4529h5,t3_djc638,1571364290.0,"Yes, some days I just feel a deep, dark pit in my stomach and a strong desire to die. I’ll go some days sleeping all day. It’s at least easier than going out and about my business trying to live with this illness. I can honestly say without my girlfriend (my only real support) I would be long gone."
schizoaffective,f3w2s15,t3_dihkds,1571190624.0,If only. It would be nice to run away from the  messed up society that we all live in and start a new.
AteTheOnion,ex4ej2z,t3_cretl2,1566003511.0,The picture of the bear munching on a mouth full of grass is just icing on the cake lmao
DeepRockGalactic,et4awm9,t3_c9c59z,1562446991.0,"I’m a new player as well. Started playing solo first to learn the game and I’ve been having an absolute blast with randoms. I usually do Hazard 3, anything more can be kinda stressful but it’s also a fun challenge. Rock and stone!"
elderscrollsonline,es4i305,t1_es4h0ud,1561585339.0,"Thank you so much for the detailed response, it helped me tremendously! I think I will make a dedicated crafter then, I’d love to be able to craft everything and make some gold with my skills too while I’m at it."
elderscrollsonline,es4fvd8,t1_es4fczl,1561583898.0,"Thanks so much for the helpful response! Assuming I did make a character solely for crafting, how would I go about that? I’ve got eso plus so I have the crafting bag, and I know how to access the bank and stuff though I am still a total newbie when it comes to this stuff lol. And would making the char an Orc be best, due to the inspiration bonuses (if I recall correctly)?"
elderscrollsonline,es4f1i7,t1_es4dw6c,1561583372.0,"What about for DPS, would alchemy/provisioning be good for that? Clothing like would be good too like you said because I’m running medium armor."
elderscrollsonline,es4dpth,t1_es4dluf,1561582544.0,"Really? Sweet, that has been something I’ve been worried about. I’m super adamant about completing everything too, so that makes me glad I can (eventually) get all of the skills unlocked. And yeah I’ve been trying to research as much as possible, it’s just time consuming like you said. I appreciate the advice!"
elderscrollsonline,es4bz4l,t3_c5ukt6,1561581490.0,"I’ve noticed sometimes the game enters a sort of ‘ghost queue’ that’ll sit for over an hour. If it’s taking a while, I usually restart it and especially as a healer it usually takes no more than 5 minutes. It could be dependent on your server/time zone though, but if you don’t like the queues then grouping with people from the zone works too."
elderscrollsonline,es49np8,t3_c5ni50,1561580059.0,"I’ve just started playing a Stamblade Khajiit char, pretty new to the game still but I was wondering what craft would benefit me the most to work on first?  I’ve got all certifications on this char, though should I make a separate character purely for crafting? Thanks!"
