CurlyHairUK,fr0ddvm,t1_fr02s0g,1589791636.0,Ive not tried the body shop stuff before thought it does look good. In terms of protective sleep hairstyles a lot of people opt for the classic pineapple where you tie all your hair up on top of your head and sleep on preferably a silk or satin pillowcase - alternatively you can wrap your hair on a silk scarf to prevent overnight friction. Pineapple only works of your hair is long enough and I find i can accidentally straighten out the hair which is being pulled tight into the ponytail which isn't what I want. I prefer medusa clipping where you clip all your hair on top of your head in little bunches- this I find has the added effect of crazy volume when I take it out in the morning!

Dad had a drug & alcohol problem for most of his life so most of his income went on that leaving us with very little. Mum would work cleaner jobs to try to make extra for us but would always immediately spend any money she got- allegedly to stop my dad from spending it on drugs but she has continued to do this ever since even when now it's not necessary. Dad has a small pension and is being taken care of by social care services. Mum has no pension and has been in credit card debt my entire life but still continues to spend money on video games and stuff (she's a big pc gamer).
