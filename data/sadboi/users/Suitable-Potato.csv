gallbladders,fkqc9gl,t3_fjv4pm,1584440038.0,"Oof. I’m low key about to be in a similar position. Waited 3 weeks for my HIDA results due to the sheer incompetence of my doctors medical assistant. (Found my report on my own though a patient portal and it said the radiologist had finish their report not even a fucking hour after I had left the hospital) 

Got a referral to a gastroenterologist late February but I have an appointment in 3 weeks with them and I already know I’m most likely gonna need an endoscopy and possibly surgery. My states chief doctor put out today that she is recommending the entire state follow the CDC guidelines on postponing non emergent procedures. 

Also as for the food you could call your local store and ask when they are getting a shipment of said items and then show up right when they open on the morning after they get the shipment. I’ve done this 3 times in the last week and have been able to get items that I need aside from hand sanitizer. Also check smaller gas stations as sometimes people wouldn’t think to shop there"

The worse ones were when people would get super cautious around me. Like to the point of where some people stopped associating with me. Others were caring and nice. But there were a few who wanted me to promise them that I would go x amount of days without it. And breaking promises isn’t my thing so I would never make those kinds of commitments. 

Honestly telling someone who has had a history of mental health issues/ self harm is a good way to go. And y’all can relate to each other in a way most other people can’t"

She also said that she’d be willing to take care of it by herself but I can just see her needing me for whatever reason 

Neither of us would have vehicles with us. I can’t even imagine taking a dog like that into an Uber for the vet. Or getting supplies from the pet store"
