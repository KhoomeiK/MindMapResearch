Plus the glory days of tumblr feminism are more or less over. And if triggered is the best word to describe it, then it is what it is. You could use ""set off"" as an alternative word.

If you pardon my curiosity: why do you watch such movies that are making you miserable? You don't seem to enjoy them."

Usually depression is a problem with them chemicals. I only can point you to meds and excercise in that regard. Meds have a shorter ETA while you'll need to do 16 weeks of excercise to get similar results."

Or is the meaningless of life a blessing? With this meaningless, you are free to do what you want. You can commit suicide if you want to, but wouldn't it be a shame for all the good you'd miss out on? Embrace the freedom you find with meaninglessness.

if it's hard to find enjoyment in anything, then you might have depression. In which case, you really ought to look into seeking mental health help"

The problem with psychiatry was that I've been put with people that were unpredictable. You know those that are a danger to others.  Plus they shove you meds without consent. Though I went ""voluntarily"" (aka we will pull the gun on you if you don't agree with), it still felt like jail to me. You can't do anything. If you are refusing, they will restraint you on one of those beds and using syringes for the treatment."

Also for the sake of your mental health, you need to stop catastrophizing the situation. If your brother was ready to accept to be admitted to a psych ward, this means that he wants to feel better and thus would be unlikely to lie about getting better.

If it wasn't voluntarily, then it's kinda hard to get out if you are still ready to commit the act. Trust me, I know.
