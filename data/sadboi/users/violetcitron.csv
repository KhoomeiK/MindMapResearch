Most importantly engage with people you like, but also
find activities that have meaning to you (creative ? ecological ? humanitary ? ...),
go on a small adventure with 40min walks at a medium-high pace as frequently as possible (especially if it's sunny) near your house and enjoy the world around you.
Grow back a good mood in general, you'll naturally sleep less.

Also in my case, to reach the mood I use a little trick that often does it's wonder : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_therapy (I skip a night and sleep around 3h starting 1pm)"

I'd say taht anyway you can have some amount of alcohol at party (where you really have fun !), it can help.

And don't force yourself to sleep 7 hour if you don't feel like it, probably a bad idea, and also you probably need 8h.
But on the other side these last month I had a burst of enthousiam about some books or on Netflix, and spent sleepless night with them it may have helped find myself again (I felt things again !) And the next day (with as much sleep as needed) how confident I was."
