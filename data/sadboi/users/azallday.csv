They see their kids as their retirement fund. They will gaslight the shit out of their kids because ""I fed you since you were a baby and this is how you repay me?"" Because God forbid you do your job as a parent and don't let a baby starve to death. They have their kids lives planned out for them and the kids are ""disrespecting"" them if they want to live their own lives. It's a toxic bullshit culture that I despise.
