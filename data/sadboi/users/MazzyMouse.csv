Marriage,fis5q5i,t3_f9fshl,1582678367.0,"I had this SAME issue with my boyfriend, in fact as in writing this he is playing Destiny with ‚Äúhis boys‚Äù. After he moved in It was like a huge was slap in the face about how adamant he was about playing his games. I had no idea he would spend all hours of the night playing. I would come home from work and he wouldn‚Äôt even notice and ignore me because he was so focused on playing. I got so frustrated and angry even that it was like pulling teeth get him to answer me when I asked him a question. At that point I was competing with his PlayStation. 
I then had a realization, what if I could make the effort to understand the game he‚Äôs playing so we could have quality time together. I have no problem putting an effort into something that was important to him to help me understand WHY it was so important to him. So asked him questions about the rules and regulations of his game and kept myself present while he was playing. I started to watch him play and understand how intense it could get and I slowly understood the Gratification he got from wining.  
Gaming is a passion for my bf and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs the same with your SO. I will cheer him on as I come into the room after making dinner to make sure I show him I‚Äôm supportive of his hobbies. You can‚Äôt kick him off his PC, I learned that really quick. Instead of trying to force him off the game to spend quality time, I have learned that I can appreciate his skill at gaming and understand his passion for it. 
After I showed him how supportive I was and that I could actually have conversations about it he showed a lot more interest in hanging out with me 1 on 1. He realized that there is a time and place for games and by me putting in an effort of his passion he then grew a passion for mine which was spending time together. Be supportive, he may not understand your hobbies or things you like either. Just because we don‚Äôt understand it doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt appreciate it too. 
I promise you once you show interest in his hobbies he will do the same for you. It will bring y‚Äôall a lot closer.
His passions should not be a ‚Äúreward‚Äù after being able to make dinner with you or something y‚Äôall do together. If it was something you enjoyed and he wanted to take you away from it, it would make you feel conflicted right? I‚Äôm sorry this was so long. I just went trough the same thing and it worked out for me that I was in the moment with him watching his gameplay and grew an appreciation for it."

BorderlinePDisorder,fi2oul3,t3_f5to3t,1582084951.0,"Suicidal ideation is what a lot of people like us think about. It almost seems like we fantasize the thought about dying or killing our selves. The best way I can explain it is you have multiple people driving in a car (your mind) the suicidal ideation person takes over the wheel with full determination that they will drive us all over the edge to kill us to end the stress, confusion and painful experiences. But we never really end up doing it because someone else takes over the wheel in our head to remind us of reality, some people who we might actually hurt in the process or someone that we really care about or even a sliver of hope that with time things will get better. Which they usually always do get better. 
Sometimes when I feel like suicide I literally feel like I have to scream at myself to get everyone to stop talking (all the conflicting emotions in my head) in the car. It helps but it‚Äôs not permanent. Realizing the issue and take control of the wheel is a start though."

Do not, I repeat do not keep staying over at his house. My ex said it was never a problem but we both lost ourselves when we started to be together 24/7. We lost out individuality. The sex stopped because of this, and part of the reason was; was because he never communicated and I constantly tried to make sure it was okay that I was over at his house and he made it seem like it wasn‚Äôt an issue, but apparently it was without both of us knowing it. Space is very important in a relationship with someone you really want to keep the feeling alive. Please don‚Äôt get too comfortable because they will loose interest sexually. I‚Äôm not vanilla in bed AT ALL! But my ex turned our sex life into that because we got to comfortable and the ‚Äúmystery‚Äù disappeared.
