depression,epyy1ge,t3_bvup45,1559653926.0,Yeah. I’ll be laughing and doing something and my brain will be like “it’s a shame I’m about to do THIS” and then I’ll just kinda shut down and want to go to bed at 3pm. Fun will feel like effort and I’ll hate it because I’m watching depression take my life from me.
