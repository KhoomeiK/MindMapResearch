I had similar happen to me when I started taking Seroquel. It would put me into a kind of hazy/dreamy state, and I would kinda just pass out. A few times I would become half conscious, and my housemate would be on top of me. When I would confront her about it, she would say that I said ""yes,"" but I do not ever remember consenting. I have no feelings in that way tward her. I spoke with my mum about it, and I have kicked her out and have made a police report."
