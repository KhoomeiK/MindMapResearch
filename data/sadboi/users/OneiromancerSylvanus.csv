depression,fljaw8h,t3_fp316i,1585204957.0,"Found myself in a similar situation after my last relationship, spent about laying in bed staring at the wall and going in and out of several mental hospitals; after a while I made some really good friends that were accepting of my habits as they pertain to my mental health that are now my roommates, and I eventually ended up putting more faith in my platonic and familial relationships than romantic attachments and that's helped with the loneliness; I still have crippling depression which I need meds and therapy for but having support from close friends and family that don't view me as a burden is a huge help."

homeless,fi5zuw4,t3_f6cpvz,1582174668.0,"if you're into sleep deprivation, random assaults, harassment from police, hunger, disease, and bedbugs/lice then go for it

also, running away to a country that you're not a native of will just mean that the people on the street there will endlessly fuck with you because as far as they're concerned, you're on their turf"
