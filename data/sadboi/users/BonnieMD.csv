unpopularopinion,fn7b4ew,t1_fn6im9p,1586716842.0,"But why would you keep a cheater as a friend? 


Honestly, I would appreciate it if someone had told me that my boyfriend was cheating. If you‚Äôre the friend who told the girlfriend/boyfriend that they were being cheated on and they want to fix and get back with their cheating partner then that‚Äôs none of your business. 

As long as you tell the person then it shows you‚Äôre a decent human being. 

I can‚Äôt imagine someone I know is getting cheated on and not tell them about it. It is one of the worse things you could do to a person. 

I get that sometimes you don‚Äôt feel like it is your business to tell the person getting cheated on. Fine, at least talk to the cheater about it, encourage them to stop, or talk to them about breaking up with their current partner if they can‚Äôt commit to ONLY ONE person. At least do something about it.


This might just be me, but...

If you don‚Äôt do something about it then it just means you‚Äôre tolerating that behavior. 

AND

Being friends with someone who is a cheater does NOT mean he or she gets a pass for being an asshole."
