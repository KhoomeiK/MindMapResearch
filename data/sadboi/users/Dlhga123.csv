For me delusions come as a result of lack of sleep. I’m bipolar and my mania can lead to insomnia. During the above delusion, I had not slept for five straight days. That’s dangerous and can kill you. We torture terrorists with that kind of sleep deprivation. 

The worst part is that the memories of those delusions stay with me. I still vividly remember running from the SS and how scared I was. For me, those memories are real."

The initial physical evidence of the latter was speaking in tongues (Peter’s words”this is that” and the prophecy of Joel). While not necessary for salvation, the baptism of the HS was necessary for Christian ministry (it is an empowerment for service). So if you didn’t speak in tongues you couldn’t be a pastor. This is the reason I left. 

I was taught that not everyone receives the gift of tongues from following the baptism of the HS but many do. I was taught that tongues were real languages but not necessarily modern ones."
