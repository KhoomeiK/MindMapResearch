I became obsessed with this guy after knowing him for only a couple of months. We were never even officially together but I fell so hard & fast. He actually instigated it & then kept changing his mind and avoiding me. This pattern repeated about four times with him pushing me away & then wanting me back. It truly nearly broke me. I have not been that emotionally stable in years. And the final time he bailed on our date I broke down & cut myself for the first time in 6 years. I couldn't understand how someone I barely knew could have come into my life & completely tear down any sense of my identity that I had worked so hard to build. I cried every night for weeks, wore his t-shirt to bed every night, went to sleep imagining scenarios where we lived happily ever after. I really thought I had almost recovered from bpd and this person came in & took all my progress away from me. I'm starting to move on now but it's left me feeling so insecure that this could happen again, and again for the rest of my life... 

All I can say is you're not alone and you're not crazy for feeling the way you do ðŸ’“ Bpd makes life one hell of a rollercoaster and all we can do our best."

I've just lost my job at a bar because there isn't enough work anymore for casual staff. I can get by on centrelink (full-time study) for a good couple of months but after that I'm going to be really struggling. Should I be planning on breaking my lease & moving back home? Or should I ride it out? Would really rather not have to move back home!"
