I know it’s shitty when people close to you don’t accept you, but I’ve learned over the years that some people just don’t “get” it, and their ignorance isn’t my responsibility to change. I’ve found a lot more peace in finding other forms of support (when I was a teenager I talked to a lot of LGBT people online and at school) than fighting for it in people who don’t support me outright. 

I’ve been out to most people (not my parents!!!) since I was 15. I’m now 23, and I wish I could say that everyone realized it isn’t a phase...but that isn’t necessarily true. What’s actually changed is my own self-perception—*I’m* convinced that it isn’t a phase, I feel more secure in my identity, so I don’t rely as much on others’ opinions. I don’t argue any more. I talk about it with people who support me, and I limit my communication on this topic with people who don’t understand.

I want to add: your current situation isn’t forever. You won’t always have to live with your family, you won’t always be in school, you won’t always have the same limitations you do now. I know how hard it is to hide something like this. I hope in the future you can surround yourself with people who see you and love you for who you are.

>[Veganism is] a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.

In these conversations I see my own past beliefs, and I know my dissonance was only a brick in the road toward a more compassionate way of being. Sometimes I forget that not everyone is on the same path. Kindness and information won’t change someone who’s closed-minded, and anger won’t deter someone who’s willing to think critically. It was “mean” vegans who pushed me to do better, anyway.

ETA: I guess the second comment also hit a sore spot for me, as someone with PTSD, depression, and a history of agoraphobia and other “mental problems.” It’s been hard, but my experiences have made me a more compassionate, introspective person!
