Personally I've always been frustrated by the limited level of control Windows gives me. Linux gives you the ability to modify everything about the GUI and beyond. It can be a real joy to use and you will learn more about computers along the way.

The number one benefit is security. It's very difficult to create malware for a linux machine and most are immune to being infected.

Even after three years of being aware of my situation I'm far from recovering. I will add it takes having a good support network to help you. It's almost impossible to regain yourself all on your own."
aww,fnxha5q,t1_fnxfwzh,1587338609.0,I had one growing up. You are right they are the sweetest cats. Mine would visit everyone in the house before bed and snuggle for a bit. Nothing fazed her.
worldnews,fnx9a7g,t3_g47okg,1587334023.0,"This guy literally lives a few houses down from me. I got so many calls from people asking me what the situation was like and if I was locked down. Well duh we all are.

Anyone from Dartmouth would know that from his practice and that creepy mouth he has on the side of the building the guy was not okay."
science,fnuv24b,t3_g3sas2,1587271847.0,I find if I vape a lot before bed I have really vivid random dreams. I wish I could figure out if there was a link between nicotine and dreaming because god damn there has to be.
Boxing,fnpnpp9,t1_fnov3sx,1587148720.0,"Yeah I didn't like seeing that. I don't care how disrespectful someone is leading up to a fight, at that point it's over, he won. Show some compassion/respect."
