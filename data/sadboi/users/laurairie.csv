This is the research they used for a reference and I  passed it on to you.  After I read it I agree research needs to be done until we can say either way if neurotransmitters return to normal.

I  would wonder why you thought I would confuse SERT with serotonin.  Anyway, can you trust the pharmaceutical chemicals  to be benign?  There is not a lot to back this research up,  but it does suggest that it may cause problems with the natural serotonin."
news,ezxjsk7,t1_ezxdb5e,1568242215.0,"At the end of the research it says, 
“There is at least one interesting potential clinical implication of these data. There seems to be some proportion of depressed patients who respond beneficially to SSRI treatment but in whom the benefit wanes over time (Byrne and Rothschild, 1998). One wonders if this may be attributable to a drug-induced loss of the SERT, such that the initial cellular target responsible for the beneficial effect of SSRIs is markedly diminished. This phenomenon has not been well-studied with controlled trials (Byrne and Rothschild, 1998). Somewhat more extensively studied, but again not with controlled trials, has been subsequent response of SSRI-nonresponders (Thase and Rush, 1997; Thase et al., 1997). It does appear that either raising the dose of the SSRI or switching to a different SSRI is successful, in perhaps 40–70% of the patients. Although quite speculative, perhaps SSRI-induced loss of the SERT provides part of the explanation of why some patients do not respond to such strategies.

In conclusion, the therapeutic efficacy of SSRI and non-SSRI antidepressants probably derives from different adaptive changes. The SSRIs (paroxetine and sertraline) decrease SERT density and reduce SERT function, as indicated by failure of fluvoxamine to prolong 5-HT clearance. Whether this is produced by all SSRIs remains to be established. Nevertheless, non-SSRI antidepressants gave no evidence of altering SERT function and did not decrease SERT density.”
So this research is saying the SSRI fucks with the SERT( the transportation mechanism for serotonin).  This is why anti depressants frequently don’t work over time.  Some people have to up the dose to get an effect,  but some people no longer respond to any amount and they think it is because the SERT does not rebound.  To be honest it doesn’t say that it can never rectify, and this is the result of the minimal research.  Antidepressants stop working over time.    The problem is then the body stops using its own serotonin efficiently.  There does need to be more and better research to see if the function of serotonin is permanently harmed."

Grieving:  
1) get a notebook 
2) in the left page write down all regrets and losses. Go through all the emotions.  None are wrong.  The stages of grief are not in order.  You may be angry and then bounce to acceptance or even numbness again and then bounce back to anger.  Only do this for an hour a day.  Grief work is hard work. Cry it out.  Crying is the healing feeling. 
3) On the other side of the notebook write:  how I love and comfort myself.  No one else can know your grief and it’s up to you to give yourself what you need to heal.  You need this so much.  Do good for yourself.  ( do not use substances.  That’s the worst thing you can do)
4) No one knows how long it will take to grieve.  It may take years.   But you will come out of it changed for ever for the better.  This is the hero’s journey.  Where your heart breaks is where the light can come in.  You will know when you have finished grieving because you will be able to laugh like you haven’t in a long time."

news,ev8qpdb,t1_ev8q2qc,1564288090.0,"The boomers were young once in the 60’s and changed a lot.  Then they got old.  Young people are idealistic and old people are ? Set in their ways.  The youth are always the hope.  If you don’t change things when you are young, they won’t be changed.  Don’t wait for the old people to die because you will be old and just like them. Our (baby boomers) generation rebelled against our parents generation.  We had civil rights protests, protests against Viet Nam and the sexual revolution.  Free sex, free drugs and free music.  Now most sit and watch the news.  Your generation will be the same.  Do something while you are young!  You have the energy and ideals."

ptsd,ev7j575,t3_cigly5,1564260386.0,"I didn’t even know I had triggers for most of my life.  I just thought I was crazy.  So, it’s good that you know how serious it is and can let people know what bothers you.  
I use “3 A’s” to deal with ptsd.  AVOID, ALTER, ACCEPT.
One of my triggers is seeing alcohol, any alcohol...in bottles, cans or glasses.  Seeing it in grocery stores just feels creepy, but don’t even try to bring it in my house!  I limit my social life.  I AVOID situations with alcohol.  I tell people, “my father was an alcoholic and alcohol upsets me.”  My friends are understanding.  But I now pick friends that don’t drink.  I can’t make people stop drinking.  
People yelling at me? I had to ALTER my behavior and stand up for myself.  It was very scary in the beginning but I now take it as a challenge to see how I can change.  
I am, (was) a people pleaser and have to ACCEPT that not everyone has to like me. 
That’s my 3 different ways of dealing with ptsd.   None are easy!  But it helped me take responsibility for my healing.  ymmv.
I don’t know if this answers your questions but hope it helps.  It takes a while to figure out what works for you.  I wish you the best your journey of life and growth."
