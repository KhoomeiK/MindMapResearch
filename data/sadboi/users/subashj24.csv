It's OK if we think of ourselves for a moment, if we don't want to be in a particular situation or place where we are not uncomfortable it's perfectly ok to say no or to escape it. In order to make others happy we need not go through such situations. We are not being a bad person by thinking of ourselves, we have every right to do things which makes us happy."

>Not sure how WC is relevant since that was last year.

If Messi had that much of a individual ability why hasn't he helped Argentina win something. If a player can't lift his team up in a crucial tournament then I seriously doubt his individual ability.

>There is a balance that needs to be made between individual ability and collective achievements and you are clearly failing that

Balance??? What balance?? Your line is pure nonsense"

I was bullied heavily in school, I asked God for safety, punishment for those who troubled me. Every other time my mom complained it in school I was spared for a week then again it'd start. 
2005
I study hard for my Pre university exams, but at the last day I have a kind off sun stroke during exams I puked all over the exam hall, I was taken to washroom and cleaned up all I could remember was I had written enough to pass in that subject. So they send me home. All my friends get 90%+ but I got only 80, Disappointed all my efforts in vain. Why God? 
2007
I believe in God. I was about to get admission in my dream engineering college but at the last minute things changed I got some rural college and my dream of pursuing engineering in that college died. Heart was broken but not faith. 
2008
Struggling through anxiety since last year I got a ray of hope, I could transfer to my dream college but we had to put some money in it, but dad disagrees to invest in me. Again my resurrected dream died.
2011-2013
Heavy depression +anxiety , because I couldn't cope with the studies nor with my surroundings. I felt betrayed by the one above us.
2013
I started reading self help books made rules on my own, wrote my own code of conduct stuck to it, I didn't stop believing in God, I believe there isn't any God it's just a make believe story. Something to keep us grounded and to make us stay away from harms way.

2019
Now it's been 6 years, I'm happy with what I'm doing. Even though there are still problems in my life(marital, financial and professional) I'm OK with it. Because I know I'll come up with a solution for all of those,because that's what I've been doing since. 

To answer your question people believe in God only when they don't have the answers for their problems themselves. If things go bad they console themselves saying ""God's plan"", if good then ""God has awarded us for being patient"" basically for the people who believe things can't be done alone by themselves they need some higher power with them."
god,ezy4z5a,t3_cr21u8,1568257918.0,"I would like to ask whose life doesn't have any obstacles. Right from a small kid to an aged adult there are obstacles, the obstacles keep on increasing in levels as we go on in life. Some of happenings in our life are just a side effect of domino effect, I believe in that because I've practically witnessed that. If we want to move forward in life or achieve something I'm sure there is something we need to do to achieve it and that hasn't been done before so we consider it as obstacle but very few people (not me) think of it as an opportunity to change.
Obstacles are the Essence of life, without it there's no taste left.
 I don't think God really exists and he has anything to do with our lives. We are the ones who can make or break our lives."

IndiaInvestments,ewimb7f,t3_coj1fl,1565452314.0,"Before buying any term life insurance think about these following points.
1)If you have lic policies then consider about the death benefit options they provide. If you have sufficient money coming from lic policies then I think buying term life insurance won't make sense.
2)Before buying any term policies compare whether you are getting age coverage till 80 minimum and lesser the amount for it is better. Don't take term policy below 50L because considering the inflation and deprecation of rupee God knows what value does below 50L hold in future,you can get 1cr life cover but I think they don't provide it for all depends on their economic conditions as of now.
3)Consider what is their settlement ratio it should not be less than 97% if you ask me, because we wouldn't want our beloved ones with some messy paper work after we're gone.
4)If you don't live in a metro city then you should consider about buying in companies which have a office in your city. Mostly companies like HDFC, ICICI & LIC have office everywhere in India. 
5) plan accordingly if you buy for 60years then there is very slight chance it could be claimed so you need to think after it, if you survive after 60 years then all the premium amount is not getting refunded though some companies refund the amount paid but those plans premium are high. If you survive the policy term then you shud have accumulated that much amount since you don't have cover anymore.
6)One bright side of Term policies is you can be bit more aggressive about your investments since you have a safety net with you.
7) companies like Hdfc, icici, max life have better term policies, better settlement ratio and their premiums are soft on your pocket, lic is good too but their premium is bit costly.
Before choosing any policies don't take quick decision consider everything and move forward. Hope I provided some good insights. Thank you"
