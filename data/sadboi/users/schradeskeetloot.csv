Due to the lack of crude storage, traders face the daunting reality of actually taking physical delivery of the commodity upon expiration of their trade.

This article is fascinating. I had no idea that thebaine had no import cap. This obviosuly resulted in the explosion of oxycodone supplies beginning in early 2000s, it was everywhere. All the dope addicts I know from high school started with oxycontin and generic oxycodone 30s. Mass was flooded with that shit.

Personally I was on a suboxone/ vyvanse combo for two years up until a recent hospitalization for psychosis caused them to yank my stimulants.

The impression I got was the clinic was pretty liberal in handing out stimulants as long as there seemed to be a need (ADHD diagnoes) bc the clinic viewed it as less dangerous to just prescribe the stuff then having people out there looking for it on the street where other drugs all also available, especially if the combo worked for people to live a better more productive life.

But the combo doesn't always work for everyone. Being addicts, some people request higher and higher stimulant doses which of course leads to psychosis. Happened to me and I learned that like any medicine, stimulants can be a blessing and a curse"
