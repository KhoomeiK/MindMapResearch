depression,f63ylkz,t1_f62p32z,1572685481.0,"I honestly wish I could do that.  So many people have let me down.  But most just eventually lose interest, and then it becomes clear that since day one they meant more to me than I meant to them.  But I don't have family or anything so I just crave companionship and support. Everytime I watch a friendship or relationship float away, I am more heartbroken than the last. and then I resent myself and my life and everyone. Anyway. Just wanted to get that off my chest I guess.  Thanks for reading."

No regrets. He's a shit bag. Left a solid trail of crumbs the entire time I knew him that lead to me cutting him out of my life for good."

It's the shit."
