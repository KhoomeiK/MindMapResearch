Itâ€™s better to reach out than to keep everything to yourself. It makes me feel happy knowing you reached out to people, I know what itâ€™s like to be alone on special occasions. Youâ€™ve already been through so much so every day that youâ€™re clean and trying is a win in my book. Keep on this path man, and youâ€™ll surprise yourself even more than you already have"

Iâ€™m in the middle on an introvert and an extrovert, I love being around people but only when itâ€™s people I know. I donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s a specific reason Iâ€™m upset, this just hit me sometimes and I canâ€™t get rid of that feeling. I just feel very alone and I unwanted, like the people I have been around donâ€™t want to be around me anymore, which I donâ€™t think is true but my head is telling me it"

You ever feel that every day you just are more and more alone and no matter what you do, itâ€™s not changing anything but then there are those few moments your feel good and included in something but the moments gone really quickly? I feel bad complaining about anything because thereâ€™s other people out there that have it worse than I do. So I choose not to talk about it to others because I think theyâ€™ll think negatively about me."
