My question: “Do I let (name) go?”


My interpretation: 
The lovers means give him another chance, but cut ties if he doesn’t pull his weight. The tower means expect the worst or at least the unexpected as far as the outcome of this relationship. The king of pentacles could mean I have some emotional hang ups of my own that are clouding my judgement. And the ten of swords I’d just up there to say “shits fucked, yo, best of luck”"
