WinStupidPrizes,fnv78xa,t1_fnv6jgd,1587282659.0,"Oh I see. You're worried that I'm defending white people... Yeah my comment wasn't about black vs white or about defending anyone, my comment was about racism in general and how it's handled here and I stated the facts truthfully. Asians are being attacked right now because of COVID19, yet nobody is offended or triggered over that, because they are Asian, which is pretty fucked up, imo. I could go on with what goes on with other races, but enough people would freak out over the things I could be pointing out that it could get me banned and I'm not here to start conflict in the first place. But you can bet your ass nobody will give 2 shits about me mentioning Asians though, and that again just shows how fucked up we are over here. I'm curious as to why you are so triggered over my comment though, when you know I'm just stating facts? Nobody likes the truth, it's just there, but things don't change for the better if they aren't talked about. Also, I would never minimize racism against anyone, quite the opposite, actually."

Don't be ridiculous, I was pointing out how the the culture is here, for those who aren't familiar with it. Crazy how offended you are over that though, especially since you know it's true. Racism is shitty no matter who it's against, how is stating that offensive to you? Your mind may work in the way where you might jump up and down yelling that you're right about something, but that in no way means that mine works that way as well"
WinStupidPrizes,fnv60iw,t1_fnv2i1l,1587281444.0,"Interesting. Thank you for your reply, I was in high school in the early 90s, graduation year of 95, so I'm always curious when I see or hear about how things change over the years. Like when I was in school, I used to carry a butterfly knife with me everywhere, most kids had some kind of blade on them back then, and we would only get it taken away if the staff saw us with it, but now I know kids can be expelled just for having a box cutter for work in their car on school property. Shit, back when my mom was in school, they had a smoking room for the kids, lol... My friends and I would just sneak smokes out front because nobody was allowed to smoke indoors, not that that stopped us."
WinStupidPrizes,fnv5mzc,t1_fnv3saw,1587281068.0,"You would think so, but people are just really shitty here, and very backwards most of the time. Take, for example, the downvotes I got just for stating the truth about how everyone is racist against someone, no matter the skin color... There's only one skin color here that's considered victims of it though, and everyone else is free game. I'll get downvotes for saying that as well, but I really don't care about internet points. Lol. Also, Trump definitely didn't start the racism here, he's just another shitty person that unfortunately got elected as president... Still not sure how he pulled that off."
