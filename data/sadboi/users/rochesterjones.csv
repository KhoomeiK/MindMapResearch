What medical professionals are interested in is the peak number which is why testing is scheduled early in the morning. Without knowing what time of day this was done, and since it’s a dumb YouTube video for entertainment and not an actual medical inquiry, the numbers don’t necessarily mean anything. Other confounding factors are medications and 5ar levels. If testosterone is converted at high rates to DHT then free T will be lower, however, so you need to check DHT levels as well. If someone’s on meds to block DHT conversion they will have much higher T levels but can develop feminine secondary traits like gynecomastia, as well as a loss in libido and body hair. DHT seems to play an [even larger role ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3167122/) than normal testosterone in muscle building.

Time does not go at the same speed everywhere and in some cases time and space become interchangeable, such as passed the event horizon of a black hole. The reason why nothing including light cannot escape that threshold of a black hole isn’t simply because it’s real real hard, it’s because time is bent onto the space axis, making every possible future end further into the black hole. Meaning leaving the black hole would require time travel into the past. 

Anyway, that’s not relevant, the point is that time is not an illusion. And we know this because things change and entropy increases. Time can become essentially meaningless once the universe reaches maximum entropy because there will be no change."

Now if a teenager, 15,16,17 etc wants to date as in go on real dates, it’s a parents responsibility to make sure they’re safe but not to simply prohibit them from doing this. Any authoritarian restriction against dating will always backfire. (As pretty much anything authoritarian does) so it’s not a good strategy for the long term wellbeing of the kid. If she wants to see someone she’s going to see someone. A parents job is to help them navigate through life, lead by example, teach, etc. and teaching someone that they don’t need to do anything with their body they don’t want is very good. On a fundamental level it really isn’t a fathers choice regardless. A father can stupidly punish a child for dating but it was still the child’s choice to date and it won’t be stopping them.
