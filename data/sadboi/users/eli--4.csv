Sorry for being late.. these past few days i’m busy with studying and a lot happened.

I still don’t know who to talk to and open up to  i have no one who understands me .

I’ve broken up with my partner even tho i love him so much because I didn’t want to hurt him with me i pushed him away just like i pushed everyone away i lost interest in my favorite thing Art and drawing .. also lost my passion in my studies that i dreamed of studying since i was younger. 
I hate my reflection now i hate looking at myself 

I‘m sorry if this is depressing.. i do need a lot of help.. i lost myself and lost everyone"
mentalhealth,fng86do,t1_fneb3q2,1586924720.0,"Thank you so much for your kind words. People don’t know how much just a kind word would help someone’s struggle. Unfortunately couldn’t find anything for my country, but it’s okay i’m going to help myself... will try my best! It will take time for me to find myself again.
 
Of course I don’t consider suicide but i just wish i wasn’t alive.

I haven’t watched JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure,i wanted to watch but .. like i said i lost interest in everything. My favorite anime is Naruto and The Disastrous Life of Saiki K and Gintama they’re my favorites!"
