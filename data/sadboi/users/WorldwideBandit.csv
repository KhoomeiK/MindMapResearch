I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôm going to be in a pit so deep by the time I get back that there will be no other way out other than suicide. There nothing I can do except cry and beg for them to take me back. I can‚Äôt be left with my own head though because it makes me think terrible things that I don‚Äôt mean and it try‚Äôs to trick me into thinking I do.
