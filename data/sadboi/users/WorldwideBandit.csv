I have another friend who I took drugs with and I started freaking out and thinking I was gonna die and get caught and he just put his arm around me and told me that he was there with me and that I would be fine (I wasn’t I got dp for a month after that :( but you get the point) having mates that you can hug or talk to when you feel a certain way is probably the only reason I’m not depressed anymore.

Anxiety,fj4mdeo,t1_fj4l2es,1583011639.0,Long story but basically we went on a ‘holiday’ 2 years ago and haven’t stopped moving and I’ve been to school for small chunks of time. Also my grandparents are my only family in England and they won’t want anything to do with my family for some reason. My other grandparents live in America and I can’t live there legally and my other family is in Australia but I’m not close to any of them.
Anxiety,fj4kxt6,t1_fj4j52m,1583010677.0,"They have seen it all before. I’ll tell you, they may not be physically abusive but they really don’t give a fuck about it. The amount of times I’ve said that I feel like I’m losing my mind I, can’t remember. They won’t take me back. I’m so scared I’m going to be in a pit so deep by the time I get back that there will be no other way out other than suicide. There nothing I can do except cry and beg for them to take me back. I can’t be left with my own head though because it makes me think terrible things that I don’t mean and it try’s to trick me into thinking I do. I’m scared of my brain and they still don’t do shit to help other than say they will when we get back."

Anxiety,fj4if5c,t1_fj4i3t4,1583008996.0,Basically since I’m on a ‘holiday’ I can’t speak to anyone. My phone won’t even work to call any hotlines that speak English. I haven’t been to school in 2 years really so I have no friends I trust enough to talk to. There’s no access to medication even though it helps. And anyway I’d rather just face it and get rid of it instead of use the medication and feel okay for like a few hours then go back to suicidal.

I haven’t been diagnosed with anything since my parents don’t have the money to get me a therapist but it’s pretty obvious I have depression, anxiety and anger issues. It really sucks huh? It’s crazy to think that the weird dreams I had to trigger my anxiety attack are common yet I think since I was already on edge I went crazy over it.
