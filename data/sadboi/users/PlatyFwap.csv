DelphiMurders,fmyke8v,t3_fwpt3j,1586488294.0,"If Libby’s dad called her at 3:15 and it did not go to voicemail, and The ME says that “it was all over by 3:30” do you think BG heard Libby’s phone ringing at 3:15? Is that what set him off? Would her phone keep recording if an incoming call came in or would it interrupt the video?

⚠️ sensitive content warning; 
I can almost imagine BG leading the girls towards a vehicle when he hears the phone ringing, becoming infuriated by this “disobedience” he snaps and kills the girls in a rage. Forgive me for this next part but I have heard that Abbys body was somehow “treated better” than Libby’s. Perhaps Libby’s defiance was the trigger and he almost felt bad Abby “had to die right then and there” because he had intended to keep her alive for some time (in his mind this is gracious and almighty of him, to bestow her with a few more days on earth in his clutches) he doesn’t feel remorse but he feels like “darn that’s a shame it didn’t work out the way I had planned it... oh well”  

This instance would be  particularly alarming to me because he was not able to fulfill his full fantasy, which means he will 100% try again. 

Even if he did succeed in fulfilling his fantasy that day he is still 100% going to do it again, he just might be able to put it off longer.

I’m not blaming you AT ALL for the terrible events that happened years later but it is important for victims of abuse or stalking to step forward and make it known to authorities that it is happening. Domestic violence is such a huge issue in this country and it is very difficult to get assistance but the more information the police have on a person the more they have to work with.

The Mob have been known to have “deals” with funeral homes to dispose of bodies and chop shops to get rid of cars. Really the Mob was capable of doing whatever they wanted back then.

I agree with your point about someone in the chop shop scene having information or perhaps funeral home employees with ties to the mob. Someone out there knows something. Unless it was *aliens*"
DelphiMurders,fmwgcup,t1_fmv08c9,1586446092.0,"Yea but I’ve also heard people say that Carter inserts a lot of his own beliefs into the press conferences and interviews... for example they have now come out and said his mentioning of the shack really has nothing to do with the case just his personal feelings about God/faith/evil. I don’t know why he would be allowed to do such a thing at the anniversary press conference when they revealed the second sketch because it created a lot of red herrings/rabbit holes. Then again maybe what he said does tie in and they just decided to scale back on what they were releasing to the public. 

I am interested in the meat packing plant as well. Could there have been an employee who worked at the Evansdale plant and then transferred to Delphi? I don’t know how anyone could obtain employment records outside of LE but it would be interesting to see if there is anyone who worked at both plants. 

•The fact that it was two young girls brutally murdered together on public trails
•The fact that stranger abductions of 1 child nevermind 2 are VERY rare 
•The fact that The two locations are in driving distance of each other 
•The fact that “quiet coercion” was used to gain control in both cases
•The fact that they were both in very small towns (why doesn’t he look for victims in the city where it’s easier to abduct someone and there are populations of runaways/prostitutes/addicts and other high risk life styles to choose from) 
•The fact that both cases occurred on the 13th of the months (July and February respectively, while school was out) 
•The fact that both girls had a cell phone with them that was left behind at the crime scene. 

And I do believe that if BG is also the Evansdale offender than it is likely that he was trying to lead the girls to a vehicle to bring them to a second location when something happened that made him snap and murder them right there. Being that there were other people on the trails that day it is incredibly brazen to go thru with the act of murdering the girls there. I think like in Evansdale he had planned to bring them to a more remote location but something interrupted that plan, possibly Libby’s dad calling and alerting BG to her phone and the recording. Or he thought since her father was nearby he might risk running into him with the girls so he murdered them right there. 
All of these (and more) are the reasons I cannot dismiss the possibility that this is the same offender. 

I have also considered that BG did have an accomplice and BG’s job was to cut the girls off at the trail and then lead them to the area where his accomplice was waiting. Just a thought but not my true gut feeling."

He can’t be local to both places unless he moved but I think people would notice that. I was thinking maybe he’s someone who works for the conservation department and knows the woods and trails very well. 

In both cases “quiet coercion” was used to get control of the girls and direct them somewhere else. I think he may be presenting himself as an officer or authority figure and making the girls think they trespassed or something in order to direct them towards another location be it his car or a more secluded area of the woods. 

Is the Delphi scene really that remote? All the reports and news broadcasts make it out to be like the girls were lost in the Alaskan wilderness. It seems to me the area is not all that remote or difficult of terrain at all. We have a little hiking area near my house that is 280 acres, Delphi was 300 acres, that’s really not a huge area.

DelphiMurders,fmagsfn,t1_fm5m85s,1585893635.0,"Just watched In Pursuit with John Walsh. A couple things stood out;

1. When the bodies were first discovered the media was reporting “two bodies found, foul play suspected” and the officers also seemed unsure if it was foul play or accidental. That makes me think the girls were murdered by beating or drowning. If they had visible wounds from a weapon I feel like the police would have immediately said this is foul play. 
2. Carter and another officer both said things like “we don’t know what the connection is. We don’t know if they were planning to meet someone. 
•I thought they had completely dispelled the rumor that the girls could have been meeting someone. Apparently that is still on the table 
3. HOW could they cal off the search knowing that Libby didn’t have a jacket and the family was begging them to keep looking??? Preposterous.
4. Would they be able to get records from Snap Chat? I’m wondering if Libby had been talking to someone, her persistence on going to the bridge (according to Kelsi) seems like she had an agenda. Snap chat deletes messages automatically, I’m sure they have explored this but since we don’t know shit, I’m saying it. 
5. I want them to set up deer cams on the bridge and the murder site. He could come back for a visit. 
6. The cell phone was found near the bodies. This is so peculiar to me. Why would BG leave the phone. He must have known she had it. He either couldn’t find it in the leaves, thought he broke it, didn’t know she had it, or didn’t care because he thought nothing would trace back to him. 
7. I think this guy is in his late 20’s, early 30’s. He has rage and anger deep inside. I think if his behavior changed after the murders it would have been almost like a bi polar person in a manic state. I think he would have been happier than usual.

UnresolvedMysteries,fm8tpes,t1_fm89kkn,1585855840.0,"Wow, Marthe was murdered about a week before I was born and Nathalie was murdered about a week after I was born. I don’t know why but whenever I hear of a murder around my actual birth date I feel connected to the people. 

Did he commit suicide before or after the second murder? 

The car was probably disposed of, dumped in a body of water, buried, burned, who knows but it must be gone if they can’t track it down. 

Something about the use of a broom and electrical wire to kill Nathalie makes me think of a female perpetrator. I guess because a man doesn’t need a broom, he would be able to beat her with his fists. It sounds like an unorganized, frantic attack, grabbing anything around to murder her with. Turning up the radio, I feel like men are able to silence their victims with their bare hands. Of course I could be completely wrong but as I was reading it I immediately imagined a woman.

That guy Yves Nadine and Mr. X sound like really good suspects to me. Yves threw another girl out of a car after trying to strangle her with a cord. That  sounds similar to parts of Marthe and Nathalie’s murders. I think it’s very obvious that there were multiple murderers operating in the area and it’s most likely more than one perpetrator here, just like the Texas Killing Fields. Predators are good at seeking out remote areas perfect for “dumping bodies”.

Be careful with those too... my mind set has come a LONG ways. I used to over-do everything including the clonidine and I ended up having several seizures from it. My doctor acted like I was lying and said clonidine can’t do that but I didn’t tell her how many I took. I took so many one week I basically was in a coma. I couldn’t walk, my legs felt like they weighed 3000 lbs, couldn’t see straight and then started fainting and having seizures. Luckily that all stopped when I smartened Up and got rid of the clonidine.  It can help with withdrawals but there are dangers with that drug too so please be careful. I’ve also read that stopping clonidine cold turkey can cause a heart attack... all stuff my doctor never told me. I also had a friend who was a nurse and she said they will not give people clonidine if their heart rate is under 60.... mine is always at like 52 and my doctor never told me that I should be taking my blood pressure before taking the medication. 

If you do feel dizzy or faint drink some water and be very careful standing up. If my boyfriend hadn’t walked me to the bathroom and caught me when I went out I would have cracked my head on the toilet when I went down. Scary shit. Do plenty of research don’t trust your doctor or anyone else with your life.

Edit: I ALSO had *rolling seizures* back to back for hours one night because I took Sudafed and Gabapentin together. I have wicked bad allergies and didn’t know there would be an interaction and mixed the two at work one night. Again my guardian angel was looking out for me because driving home that night I was so out of it, dizzy, nauseous, headache, couldn’t see straight, drove 45 mins home on the highway at night in the rain WITH NO HEADLIGHTS OR WIND SHIELD WIPERS ON! I don’t know how I made it but as soon as I sat down on my couch I had a seizure and then they continued for hours. I went to the hospital but I forgot that I had taken Sudafed so no one knew why I was having seizures. The doctor thought I took too much Gabapentin (which I’m sure I did but I know it was because of the Sudafed). They gave me a fluid bag and I went home a few hours later. I’m happy to report I have not had any more seizure episodes since I stopped being so crazy and reckless with pharmaceuticals."
gabapentin,fm7utr7,t1_fm74led,1585837229.0,"So you’re still taking Oxy everyday? I would definitely look into a suboxone program but IMO the key to success there is to start on the lowest amount of sub you can and wean as fast as *you* can (this will be different for everyone and you will know when your brain/body has healed enough to lower or stop your dose. Talk therapy or meetings are HUGE. I never went to meetings they just aren’t my thing, I feel they bring shame and stigma to me so I have always just met with a therapist one on one but it has been instrumental in re-wiring my brain). 

A lot of doctors prescribe too much and it not only dulls your senses and keeps you in a state of high, but it makes it very difficult to get off the subs in the end. 

I asked to be started on 2 mgs and I’m down to .25 a day now. Feels much better and much more successful then when I was taking 8mg strips 3x a day. Insanity. Hardly anyone needs that much Suboxone. I was taking at least 4 30mg percs a day for years and 2 mg subs was plenty to keep withdrawals at bay. 

Gabapentin has done wonders for my mood and anxiety. It keeps me above my happiness threshold for the most part (I think this is the piece that is most helpful for my recovery, I used to get very depressed when I was just on Suboxone. Gabapentin has increased my sociability and eases anxiety and some opiate withdrawals symptoms. I think it will be very useful when I make my final jump off the Suboxone soon. 

Good luck! My best advice though is to get away from all things opiate. Suboxone is a tool, a means to an end, it is not the final destination. I know your question wasn’t about subs but I feel very strongly about people being prescribed way too much for way too long so I’m just putting it out there.

Edit: 1200 mg of GABA every 4 hours is A LOT! You can definitely cut that down to 1200mg a day! Withdrawals from Gabapentin can be brutal so be careful taking that much.

My first time I went through horrible withdrawals (sweating, anxiety, RLS, skin crawling) but the next time I was able to stop them with no problem at all. Another Time I weaned myself off very easily. 

This past week and a half (ran out of my script early for first time in a long time) I experienced increased anxiety but nothing more than that. I make sure to take magnesium supplements and hot baths with epsom salt (magnesium absorbed thru your skin). Drink more water. Fish oil capsules. Kava stress relief tea, lemon balm, anything that brings you comfort. 

If you have any gabs left start taking the absolute smallest amount you can to wean down to make any withdrawals more bearable, if you can even skip a few days completely that would be great. I think you should be able to skip 1 or 2 days without any withdrawals.

Just got my script filled today. My plan for this month is to do two days on two days off type thing. I’ll let you know how that goes. Good luck, stay calm, I think a lot of it is mental, and magnesium deficits! You got this!"

The withdrawals are not only God awful but they can kill you. You cannot stop this medication cold turkey if you have been consistently taking it. Talk to your Doctor. 

Read more subreddits. Check out what recreational users have to say they will let you know the truth about the withdrawals. Sometimes better than Doctors can. 

Good luck, I would strongly suggest you get off that medication and practice other anxiety relief techniques. It’s hard, I used to think impossible, but I feel better now than ever before. All I take for anxiety is Gabapentin and it does wonders (still a risk of withdrawal with this drug but nothing like Xanax and it doesn’t even happen to everyone)"

•Listen to music 
•Dance 
•Learn Tik Tok Dances 
•Make Tik Tok videos
•Watch other people’s Tik Tok videos 
 •Make a vision board (this is good for hours of distraction/meditation) 
•Read a book 
•Do 20 push ups/sit ups/squats 
•Journal/Blog (could be about your anxiety surrounding coronavirus) 
•Listen to a Podcast (My favorite Murder is my favorite and they talk about mental health a lot) 
•Organize your kitchen cabinets/closets 
•Match all your socks and get rid of lone/ripped ones (I find organizing/cleaning makes me feel like I’m in control of something and I’m making things better) 
•Bake yourself a treat 
•Watch a reality tv show (other people’s problems with hilarious editing gives me great relief. Real housewives of New York is so good, Vanderpump Rules, Summer House, ... I’m kind of assuming you’re a female or gay man for this suggestion) 
•Watch ‘Containment’ on Netflix and face your anxieties. For some reason even though this show basically depicts our worst case scenario I found it kind of settling)  
•Draw 
•Make a Comic Strip/Create your own superhero/alter ego 
•Watch YouTube videos 
•Websleuth a cold case or active investigation. Just make sure to follow the rules of whatever group you’re part of.
•Practice and perfect makeup/Hair looks 
•Sing 
•Play solitaire/Candy Crush etc. 
•Make your grocery list 
•Talk to someone about your anxiety. Try to work through it and put it to bed. 

I think you get the point.... anything that either takes your mind off what you’re stressing over or makes you feel better about it. We will all be ok. You are not alone."

Anxiety,fkxtmgy,t3_fkq88w,1584635196.0,"I believe that *earth* will always return to “normal” but that doesn’t necessarily mean our species will. A meteor took out all the dinosaurs but earth recovered. I think Mother Nature will eventually figure out that we are the cancer that is hurting her and she will deal with us accordingly, I.E. natural disasters and viral outbreaks. Hopefully we will start taking global warming seriously and start treating our planet with a little more respect before she kicks us off.

I think some things that will change after this will be better research, hospital protocols, medical equipment reserves, and changes in our economies like places who rely almost solely on tourism will likely see the flaw in that plan and create a more self sufficient economy for their people. Perhaps more people will be able to work from home all the time. That would decrease workplace exposure to illness, traffic, and carbon emissions, as well as decreasing child care costs, gas and car maintenance, and tax dollars spent on repairing road ways. It would open up space in over crowded cities like parking lots and buildings we could then use for housing or treatment beds, 

There will probably be some changes made to international travel as well. Perhaps you will have to be cleared by a physician before you can travel abroad or come back from being abroad. I don’t know exactly what will change but events like this don’t happen without bringing some form of change, let’s hope they are positive changes."
