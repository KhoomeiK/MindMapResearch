When I was struggling with disordered eating I displaced a lot of my guilt, shame, and anger at my partner even though I was the one asking for his help. If she’s in a place of denial and you bring it up she can feel totally alone and attacked. If you come from a place of calmness and love she may be that more inclined to try the things others have commented as advice! 

It’s not easy to be on either side of a partnership when someone has an eating disorder but there is a strong community of survivors and your family will get through this."
