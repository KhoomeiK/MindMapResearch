You said you did this pre-internet, which means your sources were likely better, and more informed. Everything I watched and read is ""here is a sensitive spot, so try this motion,"" not ""if you look here, you can see that Brandi's urethra is closer to her vagina than average, so be sure to do <insert this thing> to prevent UTIs."" The internet is FLOODED with the surface-level, pleasure focused information rather than anatomical education. That's just how it is. It may be easier to access that anatomical information than it used to be, but you have to sift through a LOT of other stuff first unless you know exactly what to search for.

The standard education related to protecting a woman's health is ""make sure you wash down there so you don't introduce bad bacteria,"" and ""don't go from anal to vaginal sex without swapping condoms first."" I have never even heard of paying attention to the exact location of the urethra and adjusting your sex life because of it. I'm sure it's a thing, and I'm sure it's important, but that is not common knowledge, nor is it something that comes up in those general searches. And also, I don't think it's intuitive. Maybe that's just me.

And ftr, anatomical diagrams from school are what made me think the urethra and clitoris were connected. The side views have them touching, if not overlapping."
badwomensanatomy,fps9ia2,t1_fpqsq4b,1588869727.0,"See, pictures like that are actually what made me think they are connected. At least, that's how it came across to me. I always thought my clit was a little ""guide"" for my pee, and the urethra was at its base. Now if they had shown pictures like [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/agY6cC6BQZPj3Kgs7), it would have been much clearer how things actually relate to each other on the exterior. But I have a feeling this would be considered too ""indecent"" to show, which is part of the problem.

Edit: I did know that urine comes from the urethra, it was the urethra's location that I didn't know. I think that's the case for most people who took sex ed and still thought it came from the clit. Everyone pees from the urethra, biology classes definitely teach that. Men's urethras are easy to see and depict since it is out in the open. Women's urethras are less obvious, imo, and since the clit is supposedly the evolutionary remnant of the penis in female anatomy (learned in biology), it's a pretty simple conclusion to make that the urethra is there, as well. Again, this is what I thought, and a few others here say they had the same thoughts."

I think I made it clear that was my opinion, not that I was claiming any authority over anything. I also think their question was fine. If they have no idea, how would they know where to start? I agree that they should look at a diagram to answer their question, so in my response I linked one. Now (I'm assuming) he has a starting place.

The reason I think that's what they meant is because that is what I meant when I questioned where I peed from a few years back (early 20s), not because I'm a mind reader. You can know that people pee from their urethra without knowing exactly where the urethra is. Again, for women, it's not that obvious. At least in my anatomy classes, we didn't have and diagrams looking straight on st a vulva. We had front views and side views of the abdomen, which don't make it very clear where everything is in relation to each other on the surface.

In this case I was not trying to come across as condescending, so I apologize for that. I just wanted to share my personal stance on how to treat people who actively *want* to learn.

I think we have a fundamental misunderstanding here. Just like this article, I'm saying that if it's the best you can do, then it's fine. ""It gets the job done"" and ""it meets what AAFCO recommends"" is by no means a glowing review. If its what you can afford and your dog handles it well, then ok, great. 

As for the whole ""ingredients"" vs ""nutrients"" confusion... of course the nutritional value is important, but where the hell do you think it comes from?!? I already knew Pedigree meets the established nutritional value, but for people so does taking all the right vitamins and eating filler fiber for the calories. I am in no way saying ""only the $100, pure 100% organic meat and blueberries foods are acceptable,"" but the source of nutrients is an important consideration. Different foods digest differently and have different effects, even if they serve the same purpose. As an example in human diet, high fructose corn syrup vs honey. In animal diets, the variety of grains that serve the same purpose, but are digested differently. Apparently my McDonalds comparison was extreme, but like, the point is the same. It's food, it provides nutrition, and whether it is the ""best"" option is subjective. But the article also says to put the money you save towards regular vet visits... which you don't.

Maybe it was someone else, but I thought you said vets weren't an authority on this, which I disagreed with. In regards to my being an authority on this, I took your advice and called my mom and talked to her about this. She said exactly what I've said, and what this article backs up.

I KNOW the people ""more knowledgeable than you and me,"" because again, my mom is a vet. She is educated in this field. And working at an animal shelter that had in house vets teach us these things does mean something. I am in no way claiming to be an authority, I am sharing what I was taught *in person* by the professionals you claim to speak for.

I used dog  food advisor as an example because I (apparently wrongfully) assumed that when it said ""expert reviewed,"" it meant actual vets and animal nutritionists. I have never used that site before, but I figured people would be more likely to believe that than some random redditor. And unfortunately, in the case of its Pedigree review, it seems to be mostly correct. I don't think ""one star"" is accurate; it may even be the best option in its price range. And I say this not as an authority, but based on how the authorities told me to judge these things.

Which once again brings me to my main point: if you (collective ""you"") can only afford cheap foods, but are a loving owner, that's fine. If you can afford to just bump it up a little bit but choose not to, it's kind of a shitty thing to do in regards to your pet's health. It's like only feeding your kids fast food when you can afford literally anything else.

Price point is a really good indicator of quality. I looked up the ingredients of Pedigree, and while I don't know the exact variety you get, it's not great. Corn isn't a good grain for dogs, they can't digest it well. Indescript bone meal and animal byproduct doesn't even tell you what animal or part of the animal your dog is eating. And ash is just a filler that has no nutritional value at all. You don't need to drop hundreds per month on dog food, but just like with people, nutrition is important.

I have made no judgements about you, other than that apparently you have some level of veterinary knowledge if you trust yourself to only bring her to the vet when you can tell something's wrong. And if you trust yourself to do that, then fine. My mom's a vet, so she's the same way with her animals. I don't know how else to explain that I thought I was talking to someone else because you guys write the same.

I also never said organic food or monthly vet visits are necessary. That is *you* jumping to conclusions, not me. Organic foods are actually not just more expensive, but often aren't actually balanced. Just like people, I think an annual vet visit is just fine, with additional visits when something is apparently wrong. And just like people, I don't believe they need top-of-the-line, luxury items or food. They need the best that a loving owner can provide them. Which I thought I was saying to the person saying they only spend $15/month on food for their 85-lb dog. Again, sorry for the confusion on my part.

Also... I think you're misunderstanding what people (including OP) are saying when we say ""thousands."" I believe $1k a year is a reasonable expectation, with $2k as a buffer. However, owners should also be prepared for those multi-thousand emergency visits, surgeries, and medical care that animals need, which you can't always predict. That's all. And I also want to reiterate... $1-2k spread out over a year isn't actually that much. It's what most of the ""I don't spend NEAR that much on my dog, only $60/month on food and then a couple hundred on checkups and supplies throughout the year!"" actually pay, but psychologically lumping all of those together makes it seem like more. Owning a dog costs less than what average households spend on their cell/internet bills. All I'm arguing is that it is, in fact, accurate."

I'm sorry I confused you with another person, but the fact of the matter is that if you follow everything shelters and vets recommend you do, it can easily reach $1k for a dog that size, and you can't predict health issues that will cost more.

It's just something that is more than corn, nondescript bone meal, and ash. Iams is a good option for good-quality at an affordable price.

I don't disagree that a loving home is better than a shelter, but typically a loving home means investing in their health to the best of your abilities.

I have to say, of all if the pets I've had, I think rats are the best substitutes for dogs. They have unique personalities, really bond with their people, are smart enough to teach tricks and train, and you can even put little harnesses on them and take them for walks! They aren't very good at standard walks though... but if you perch them on your shoulder, walks are a lot of fun! They hang out and take in the sights and smells.

Finding homes for older dogs (even 3 or 4) is exponentially harder than for younger dogs. Better to find a good home now, than putting it in a bad home for potentially forever. 

Something I don't think a lot of people get is that $1-2k *isn't that much.* that breaks out to $85-170 per month. People spend more on their phone and internet bills than that! Since the dog is a lab, it will get pretty big, so spending $60+ on food a month is not unreasonable. Add in accessories and supplies, and standard medical care, averaging $85 is completely feasible.

I'm not saying ""a couple grand on a dog is too much!"" I'm saying it's still an expense that owners need to consider, and people who aren't taking into account that their monthly expenses add up to a pretty significant amount over the course of a whole year are, well... wrong. And if you can't budget even $1k for a dog, especially a breed of that size and with common health issues, you can't budget the multiple thousands an emergency surgery will cost, or a hip surgery when it's older. People like this guy all too often will say, ""well that's too much money, just put him down."" My mom is a vet and this has happened a disturbing number of times. If the owner isn't an asshole, they might be able to crowdsource the money, or pinch pennies to come up with the amount, but very often they either opt to just not get the treatment and let the dog live a less full and likely painful life, or give it up to a shelter. And as I said, older dogs and dogs with medical issues are harder to adopt out. If they end up at kill shelters, oftentimes they'll be euthanized in advance to make room for the more adoptable animals. It's really sad.

I worked at a no-kill shelter for a while in high school, and these are factors we were always taught to keep in mind. We actually wouldn't have even adopted out this dog without the consent of both parents. We never asked about finances, but we needed to know the dog was going to a safe and loving environment."

Adding another living creature to a household like that is irresponsible and sounds akin to ""if we just get a dog, he'll change his mind and it'll fix everything.""

Adding to that, using expenses as an excuse rather than just saying ""I don't want a dog,"" is also shitty because it doesn't allow for an honest conversation to find a compromise (i.e. a smaller, less expensive animal that could remain largely out of OP's life).

I think grandma being as involved as possible is a good thing. If (when) the baby mama shows her true colors, grandma would be an excellent candidate to be the kid's guardian if the dad doesn't want to be. Then later he can become the guardian.

Not that someone else is cleaning for them. But they will need other supplies, and will need to do it more frequently in order to keep the house in the same state as it is cost-free.

($50 + $15) x 12 + $40 = $820. So without factoring in any accessories, with what you gave me that's nearly $1k per year. Not to mention... $820 x 7 + $250 = $5,990, and that is again just the numbers you gave here, not toys, accessories, or supplies. Idk where you are, but $40 is SUPER low for a vet checkup, even if it is only a physical. You lucked out with getting chicken wire for free; I don't know why you would just assume that's something everyone would have access to. You're also assuming this dog won't require any dog proofing, which is another unfair assumption. Dogs will chew on things, scratch up floors, have accidents in the house, etc, which you have to find a solution to.

Something else... why tf is everyone acting like agreeing that animals are a big expense means they aren't worth it??? Ffs people spend more on their cellphone bills than I'm saying an annual cost for a lab would be. It's not that much when broken out into the small ""payments"" we are all thinking of. It's not like the average pet owner is dropping 2 grand all at once. It averages to like $100/mo max when factoring all of the basic expenses in (which makes the stomach pumping that was ""only"" $250 a lot more significant, given it is 2-3x the normal cost for the month). But for some people, that's a lot. Hell, I couldn't afford another animal right now. But then again, my dumb cats also have unforeseen health issues that makes one of them cost me $1000/year in oral care alone, probably another $500 for the rest of his healthcare, and another cat that needs crazy expensive special diet foods ever since his $5k surgery. If I was pushing my budget with the bare minimum, I wouldn't have my cats anymore. I still had to borrow money from my mom for the expensive surgery. I'm lucky I had her to help me then. This cost is a completely fair argument when considering whether a pet is feasible or not.

(I checked, pet insurance doesn't cover these because they are considered ""pre-existing"")

Tl;dr: costs add up, cost varies by location, $1k/year is only $85/mo (so about what everyone is saying they are ""only"" spending), but for some people that's a lot. If you factor in unexpected medical expenses, budgeting out a couple thousand per year is not unreasonable. Also, none of this means it's not worth getting a dog."
relationship_advice,fp1i5fi,t1_fp1gf38,1588236333.0,"... I'm not letting reddit fool me into anything. I'm considering my own experiences, the 5 dogs I've had over the course of my life, and what I've learned from my mother, who is a vet.

For a dog the size of a lab, decent food will run you almost $1k per year on its own. If you get cheaper food or if the Costco brand works for the dog's needs, you can get that down to $500. Preventative care isn't cheap. Antibiotics and ear infection medication isn't cheap. As a lab gets older, vitamins that support joint health aren't cheap. Annual vet appointments can be as low as $45 depending on where you are, but that doesn't include any tests, just a physical. If the dog needs regular dental work, you have to do blood tests every time (~$150), plus the cleaning itself. And if the dog needs any extractions, that costs even more.

The issue here is that most people don't realize that these costs add up. It's not like the average person is spending thousands of dollars all at once (except in severe medical cases), it's broken up and not even into set intervals; just whenever it's needed. But let's say the average owner spends $60/month on food, and an additional $100 for a couple of months to cover health care, accessories, and supplies reached $1k before you know it. I'm not saying it's a ridiculous amount, or any comment on OP's stance here. $1k is honestly not that expensive for most people. Average households spend more on their phone and internet bills than that, but there isn't a situation where they will have to drop $5 all at once because their cellphone swallowed a sock. I'm just saying that it's an accurate budget."

""Oh, it's only $40-60 a month for food, everything else is basically a one-time cost!""

Ok, $40-60/mo equates to $480-720/yr. Toys don't last forever, you will need to replace those. Preventative care isn't a one-time cost, either.

And have fun telling your vet, ""well I paid $100 last time, so I never have to again! It's a one-time cost!"" Unless they just never take their pet to the vet, which makes them not super reliable for pet cost advice imo.

Plus, not even considering the major surgeries, minor and common conditions add up real quick. Antibiotics, at least $100.

$50 for food for a lab is on the cheaper end, and even at $50, that's $600/year on food alone. Once you factor in accessories (leashes may be a one-time thing, but collars wear down, toys can get destroyed, housekeeping expenses will rise, if you need to fence your yard, then that's a huge hit to your wallet, etc.), let's say $100/year as an average. Vet checkups, shots, and preventative care, $300/year minimum. So we've already hit $1k for one year of owning a lab. If the dog needs regular dental work, develops joint issues (as labs are prone to do), gets regular ear infections (another lab classic), or any other relatively common and minor health issues, that shoots up by a few hundred a year at least. If any major health issues arise, then whoopsie daisy, we're pushing $3k+ for one year!"

I'm a person with two dogs and 4 cats. I spend a shit ton of money on my animals, and I can tell you that no two are the same. And you can't predict which ones will need more expensive, intensive care. One of my male cats has had issues with blockage. After a couple thousand dollars for surgery, now he has a special diet that costs about 3x as much as before. Another of my cats has severe dental and oral issues that have cost me around $3,000 in surgeries to date, and I've only had him for 4 years. These were issues the shelter didn't identify, so I had no idea when I got him that I was committing to those expenses. I DID know that he had a history of URIs, which means he is more susceptible to infection than others. Whenever he goes on antibiotics, that's $200. And with the URI/oral issues combo, I spend that a LOT.

My other cats? Not that bad. Just annual checkups and food, replace toys every once in a while, altogether about $1k a year for both. My current dogs? No problems yet. Between the two of them, both 30-35 lbs (so smaller than a lab), maybe $2k a year. My previous dog? Got lymphoma and until she just couldn't go on we spent I don't even know how much on medication, repeatedly getting her abdomen drained, and anything we could to make her as comfortable as possible.

If you need to fence in your yard, that is a HUGE costs up into the thousands depending on the size, but we'll leave that out here. So, factor in a little wiggle room, $1,000 is about the minimum for any reasonable pet owner.

Your pet needs antibiotics, a fairly common prescription? $200.

Dog has some gingivitis and needs annual dental cleanings? Once you factor in bloodwork, that's $150 at a minimum. If they have to pull teeth, that goes up.

Dog flips its stomach (granted, not super common with labs), or eats something that will block its digestive system? Thousand dollar emergency surgery, at LEAST.

Dog eats some rat poison? Hopefully they can pump its stomach in time. For a shit ton of money, that is.

Purebred issues like hip problems start acting up? Ho boy, your monthly cost just went WAY up.

I think people don't realize how much the small purchases add up, too. Someone said $60/month for decent food? Well that's $720 right there. Add in accessories, vet visits, dental cleanings, and budget in some room for medical emergencies, $2k/year is a relatively safe bet.
