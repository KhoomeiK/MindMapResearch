If you have not experienced loving or caring about someone who let you believe they felt the same only to be discarded because they are done, I am not sure you can understand the depth of the pain. I certainly hope you never experience anything like this. We cannot jail people who have personality disorders and in no way would I want to see that, but it is very important reasonably normal people and especially HSPs be on the lookout for them. I like to say they are fine at work , fine for board games and fine to have a drink with, but under no circumstances do you let them into your core. They thrive by causing chaos and some of them enjoy destroying people who can feel deeply, something they cannot. Just keep up your defenses and never, ever trust them."

Even while admitting his problems, he manipulated the interviewer when he answered the question concerning whether the ASPD thought the interviewer was inferior. Of course not because the ASPD wants his message out to other ASPDs. more importantly, he still does not have concern for NTs and especially HSPs. Perhaps he is sincere in his efforts, but he will never grow a conscience nor ever stop looking at people in the context of serving his needs. An NT does not want an ASPD in their life and an HSP doesn’t want them on the same block. People get hurt by ASPDs to the point of suicide and yet they think this is all a game. I have sympathy for the victims and survivors of these “humans” but ASPD are treated as I would treat a wild animal: can be trained, but never, ever trusted and never allowed beyond my defenses."

And  

"" I’m not going to remind you. If your mind wanders, it may. I’ve said the  disclosure I had to. ""

@ OP - Oh yes, you are responsible.  Stop sending the texts, stop using language that suggests you really like the person and give this person space. 

It is likely if the OP continues with his/her behavior, someone will come along who the OP burns and their target returns the favor 10X over.    It happens and sympathy for the OPs plight will be lacking.

So many people hope for this and it never comes along or they get it and fuck it up.  You will never regret missing ballgame or party, but missing or losing the love of your life will be the regret you have on your deathbed.

Please send this letter."
UnsentLetters,f9cfhdt,t3_e49s80,1575223096.0,"God, how disgusting is this?  An uncreative, burnt synapse, morally corrupt consumer of oxygen makes a profit off of a human's expression of emotion?  It is repulsive."
UnsentLetters,f97k47t,t1_f96hlgr,1575166670.0,"""... they are healing/healed and seem to be doing great. ""  Appearances can be deceiving.  It is possible your person misses you as much as you miss him/her and although they are getting along, they would still welcome you.  I know this to be true of me and the person I miss so much.  My life is good, filled with friends, activities and volunteer work, but how I wish I could hear their voice again."
UnsentLetters,f8zq9c0,t3_e2r4vo,1574963774.0,"I have gone back and read your other letters and you deserve a love as great as you are capable of giving.  For your sake, I hope you can stop missing this person so you can let a better, more emotional stable person into your life.  You are worthy of it.  Please believe that."
UnsentLetters,f8q7o51,t3_e1bbez,1574713391.0,This is incredibly compassionate.  You are a very special person.
UnsentLetters,f8q72aw,t3_e1bhh4,1574713128.0,"""...  take responsibility for that.""  You are taking the first steps forward and those are the hardest.  Once you stop hating yourself and have compassion for your own soul, you will begin to see everything in a different light.  You are not irreversibly flawed, but just flawed like every other person on the planet.  Give yourself a break and if he/she loves you unconditionally, they will find a way to let you back in.  But, first and foremost, you must love thyself."
UnsentLetters,f8q5oln,t3_e1dkro,1574712513.0,"Actually, it is now that you might be able to have something again with this person.  Good luck."
UnsentLetters,f8pxxn2,t3_e1i8gx,1574709044.0,Silent treatments are a form of wielding power.  The absolutely best thing you can do for yourself is remember anyone who really cares about you would never do this to you.  Please find someone who will treat you the way you should be treated.
UnsentLetters,f8pxdw2,t3_e1jwht,1574708795.0,"Some people will open up and others will or cannot do so.  Also, her problems (I assume her because of the use of the modifier, pretty) need to be resolved by her and her alone.  But, you wanting to be there for her is a beautiful and amazing thing.  I hope you find true love one day, even if it is not with this person."
UnsentLetters,f8purei,t1_f8m3r10,1574707610.0,"I am so sorry to hear.  But, silence is worse and you simply will never heal."
UnsentLetters,f8pu9z7,t3_e1g812,1574707390.0,I am so sorry.  Please believe you will see your baby again one day.
UnsentLetters,f8lzbdi,t3_e0vtzn,1574626756.0,"You are in love, pure and simple.  What is fucking it up is your head.  Get your head out of the way and be brave and let her into your life.  She is likely just as confused as you are if only because of the mixed messages.  Life is too short to run away from love and it will absolutely be one of the things you will regret not having pursued when you are on your deathbed.  Not work, not video games, not drinking buddies, but true love.  Don't let this go.

Another thing:  we all have dark and evil sides.  An unconditional love sees it, knows it and embraces it as part of who you are.  If she loves you, she'll understand."
UnsentLetters,f8lwh7p,t3_e12hrq,1574626079.0,"Only people who do not struggle with mental illness think being fucked up is beautiful.  What is beautiful is getting to the other side and realizing part of the reason one struggles so much is because they are wired differently than the rest of humanity.  Now, that part can be beautiful, but it can also be ugly as all get out."
