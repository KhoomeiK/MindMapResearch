Anxiety,fndq899,t1_fndl68f,1586875406.0,"Don't apologize! I am just so happy to be here to help! You are fine girl!! <3  Thank you for thinking about me though while you are going through crap! 

OOOOH! lolol! I took that way to literal - my bad! 

You can easily lose that weight - not much at all, girl! You got this. But we do need to do it healthy! There are many subreddits. Maybe you could research and show your dad all about it! Because you are right, being healthy is not by how skinny you are! Really sit him down and tell him how you feel. He sounds so loving - I am sure he would listen and take what you said to heart if you really spoke to him. Have you tried? 

And no, you are not a spoiled brat - that's the anxiety talking and all the rough stuff you had to live through. I cannot even imagine how it must've felt watching your dad get taken away by an ambulance!! You are so strong for living through that. I can totally understand why you feel the way you do. My anxiety would be through the roof.

I'm sorry your dad's business is hurting right now. It's really tough out in the world at the moment, but I know we will all get through this! 

Man sounds like his worry about his health and weight might be being put on you. And I am sorry about that. When I had some troubles with my Mom, it helped when I realized she couldn't control how she felt. Sort of like our anxiety. It made me forgive her a bit and not be as uptight. Not saying you shouldn't eat more than 1.5 meals a day, it just made me not as angry towards her. If that makes any sense. It gave me relief.

I am sorry you are having these troubles, and I wish there was more I could do - but I am always so happy to listen. I know sometimes just getting crap out can help. <3"
Anxiety,fndk1ke,t1_fndh0iv,1586871775.0,"Don't worry about the word vomit - I do it all the time! I am working right now so will be sort of short but want to make sure you are okay. 

I am sorry you had such a rough night. Slammed for a salad??! What the heck? 

I know you said you are on a weight loss journey, and I am sorry if I am overstepping, but do you really need to lose weight? I've only read these few posts from you, but it almost sounds like your Dad has a problem with food himself? Does he have some sort of anxiety or disorder? Again, I am sorry if I am overstepping. I just want to help!!  Maybe that could be the root of all of this? Especially if he is loving and fine in all other areas. 

Either way - 1.5 meals is not enough for a person. Not enough. I hope you get enough nutrients you need. Maybe you could sneak a snack or 2 a day and hide it in your room to eat later? If you can drive and have money, maybe you could hide snacks in your room? 

Also - how old is your baby? If breastfeeding YOU NEED nutrients and even more food. You are processing calories like crazy. Also, if you just had the baby you def need more food than 1.5 meals. That's nuts. I really hope you get the food you need. Have you told your Dad this? Are you on the weight loss journey because of baby weight? Because it's okay to have baby weight. Do not feel like you have to rush your body back to where it was - YOU GREW A BEAUTIFUL HUMAN! It's going to be different.

I am happy you are smart and strong enough to break this vicious cycle. I know you will be a wonderful mother. You will make sure your child grows up strong and healthy without ever feeling hungry. You are so strong, girl. You've got this. We all know you do. I am so proud of you.   


(Again, my anxiety is bothering me - I hope I didn't overstep anything. I really wasn't trying to. I just really wanted to help!)"

Anxiety,fndh965,t1_fncryis,1586869956.0,"Thank you - I hope you are doing okay today. I am so sorry to hear about the breakup. 

First off: Sadly, sometimes not every relationship works out. That is nobody's fault. Nobody's wrong. Also - there is no timeline you have to follow to heal. Do what you need to do - however long it takes. <3 

I think you hit the nail on the head. We all have to accept that we have to take care of ourselves as well. We cannot just expect/put it all on out S/O to help. That's unfair. Unbalanced. 

I used to put it all on my current S/O. He finally sat me down to have a nice and supportive talk about how I really needed to step my game up about my anxiety. It really made a shit ton of impact on me. Now I make sure to go to my appointments (even if it's hard for me) and stick with 'em. He still supports me 1000% on my bad days but now I am not putting all the stress on him. 

He made me realize how hard it was for him and how sad it could get watching me cry and hyperventilate. I never even considered how it must be on the receiving end. 

*And it's not like we mean to do that to our S/Os - we just don't know until we are told how impactful it is.* 

I don't know where you guys stand, but, If you want - maybe you could reach out to her and say you will work on your anxiety and maybe she could help you? Or tell her how you are working on yourself moving forward and would like to see her in a few weeks?  


I hope I could help some. I didn't want to leave you hanging and really wanted to try and give you some stuff I have been through! I hope you are doing good today. <3"

I know you still worry about it - but I think, and hope, it will decrease in time with practice. He knows how you feel and I am sure he wouldn't hide anything since knowing so. He will let you know if there ever is a problem. No need to worry. That's what I always told myself anyway. Over the years, I just totally forgot about freaking out over this issue. Now I don't question anything about us.
