The hospital was an hour away from where we lived and l went long stretches without seeing my family.  The staff was amazing and took me to the movies,  Ice skating ( with my feeding tube machine so l didn't miss a dosage and that thing was massive....) and on odd errands within the hospital.  I can tell you without a doubt that l was a lucky one.  Most patients didn't get that.  I an a tactile person and NEED physical contact.  I didn't get it that often.  I wished for animals. 

People who work with therapy dogs are hero's.  You bring joy and love into people's lives at some of their darkest hours.  I cannot thank people ( and their animals!) Enough for taking time to do this.

I went back the next day with the same thing and was told again that nothing is wrong.  No tests were done at all.  Not a single one.  I went to my doctor a few days later for an appointment that was booked for something else.  I told her what was happening and she flipped. I gave never seen a medical professional be so emotional.

Whenever l start to feel anxious l sit down if l can and try doing ""number games"" . I start from 100 and do the 3x ( or any other number ) table backwards.  Sometimes l find the things l can feel, three l can see, three l can taste , three l can hear etc..  when l start calming down l try to think of all the other times l have been in a similar situation and it's all been ok.  Emergency rooms are a hard place for me as well but l try to remember that a place can't hold power over me.    If you're feeling particularity strong one day, try going to the waiting room with a friend or family member you trust and just sit there.  Talk to your friend, read a bit in a book and then leave.  That way you can slowly try to overcome the trauma in a safe way. 
I hope that you find something that works for you and that the migraines are better.  They are evil things."

One : Go walk a dog.  Don't have one? Don't have any friends that have one? Go to your local shelter.  They are so happy to get out and the love an animal can give is like nothing else. 
Two: Bouldering! ( or another physical activity you can do solo or with friends) bouldering is my go to after animals. It challenges you mentally and physically and most places have a gym these days.  Go and try by yourself or with some friends. Even if your scared of heights and just stay low to the ground, it's amazing. 
If it lasts for a while longer, go see your doctor.  Sometimes just talking about things releases tension you never knew you had.

First of all animals.  The love they give you is really healing.  If you don't have one l suggest going to your local SPCA and either walking the dogs or sitting with the cats and reading.  This way you get contact with another creature, you also help them by giving them love and exercise.  
The second thing that's really helped me is Rock climbing indoors ( bouldering ) . So many places have gyms cropping up.  They have learn to climb nights that have a smaller number of people going and they are all beginners to.  Grab a friend you trust and get your blood pumping.  The sense of accomplishment and endorphins from climbing some walls is amazing. It can be a solo thing to if you don't have anyone who wants to go.
