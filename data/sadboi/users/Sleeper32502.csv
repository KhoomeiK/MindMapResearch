France - Fewer than 100 new deaths as hospitalisations continue to fall

5/9/2020
French health officials on Saturday announced another 80 deaths from the new coronavirus, the lowest figure recorded over 24 hours since early April.

The figures for those in intensive care also fell, with 38 people admitted for critical care.

Just four of the latest fatalities were registered in nursing homes, a spectacular fall compared with daily figures for recent weeks, against 76 who died in hospital.

France is on Monday due to begin relaxing lockdown restrictions imposed eight weeks ago with health authorities now registering much reduced pressures on intensive care services compared to the height of the crisis.

“We are now firmly focused on getting this medicine to the most urgent patients around the country here in the United States,” Daniel O’Day said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” 

“We intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week, beginning to work with the government which will determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients are that need this medicine,” he added.

The first results from human trials of a coronavirus vaccine being developed by Oxford University should be available by mid-June, said Oxford professor John Bell.

""This is still a development program. We need still to demonstrate that this vaccine works in human populations,"" he told BBC Radio. ""But the team ... have vaccinated several hundred people now and we hope to get some signal about whether it's working by the middle of June.""

The Oxford University research team is partnering with UK-based global biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to develop and manufacture this vaccine on a large scale.

""Once we get an approval by the regulators, we don't want to have to go back to the beginning and work out how we manufacture it at scale. And we also want to make sure that the rest of the world will be ready to make this vaccine at scale,"" Bell said.

According to the university, AstraZeneca will work with global partners on the international distribution of the vaccine, particularly working to make it available and accessible for low- and medium-income countries."
