I remember being sent home early and my mum locking us in the house. The shooter was known to our family, and my dad had phoned home to say to get me out of school and stay put until he could get home too as they weren't aware he'd killed himself at that point.

Between looking out for her, the kids and trying to run my business I just had nothing left for myself.  


I'e spent the summer fighting off her desire for a divorce, which of course has now subsided but has created a bit of a void between us we need to fix. She's getting back into therapy which I hope helps. 

It's horrible to go through on both parts especially with young children who can't really understand why mum one day is there and wants to play and do everything with them, to the next when she is screaming to be left alone and won't join in anything with us. She wants so much to be mum, be herself and be the woman we both know is in there, but something is just holding her back from being here.   


It's like she's on autopilot, but without a destination, in a holding pattern above an airport with turbulence. And they've stopped the food and drinks service just to piss us off a little more. 

This summer has been awful. I don't join in here much but even just reading that our life is even a tiny bit similar is enough for me to know I'm not crazy for holding on to what we have and what we could have if we take the right steps."
