I have worked in mental health for at least 5 years in some capacity. I have been a volunteer counsellor, a mental healthcare assistant and now I do activities in a psychiatric hospital. My salary now is the highest it's ever been and it's still only 18k (the national average here is 35k)

A community psychologist is earning around 35-45k depending on experience and if they are a specialist. 

But I do agree that services certainly DO NOT have enough staff or the capacity to see more people. I see so many people that could have been seen in the community and kept out of hospitals if the resources weren't spread so thin and the waiting lists weren't so long."

mentalhealth,f8du21e,t3_e0fbq2,1574509477.0,"First of all, you're not a disgusting person. You're struggling and you're trying to find a way to cope with that, that doesn't make you disgusting it makes you human.

I work with people who self harm, we try to encourage people to find alternative ways to get the same release without causing harm. We also encourage people to recognise what is an effective distraction technique for them. 

For example, running and exercise releases similar endorphins to harming so when possible try to get exercising, it's a distraction to get you through when your urge to harm is at its highest and it'll give you the same 'rush'. 
Another option is holding ice in your hands if you need to feel the pain, the ice will hurt in your hands but won't cause you any lasting damage like cutting will. 
Similar to this, snapping an elastic band or hair tie on your skin will give you the same short sharp sting as a cut. 

You can also make a self soothe box to help you surf the urge when you're feeling overwhelmed or distressed, they can contain stress balls, music you like, poems or stories you enjoy, positive messages etc.  https://pro.psychcentral.com/psychoeducation/2017/05/using-a-calming-box-for-self-soothing-and-emotional-regulation/

Lastly a basic grounding exercise can go a long way in the moment, you focus on the things around you to bring you back into the moment. It's basically just: 
5 things you can see 
4 things you can touch 
3 things you can hear 
2 things you can smell 
1 thing you can taste 

I hope any of this helps, I know it's hard at times but you are strong and you will get through this. You've already made the first step by posting on here today."
