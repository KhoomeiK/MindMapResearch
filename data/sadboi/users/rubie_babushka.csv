Typically my flashbacks are very audio-visual and then the physical sensation happens after that‚Äôs started. But, I have experienced purely physical sensations before that I never even thought could be flashbacks since they were the feeling of hands on my back and shoulders, and they usually happened while in the early red flag stages of having boy problems (which have been the source of most of my trauma). It freaked me out because they didn‚Äôt follow the same pattern as my other flashbacks, and feeling hands on you that aren‚Äôt there is, you know, startling. So this is kind of big, that they might have been flashbacks.
But I‚Äôd really like to know more about this kind of flashback. Do you usually experience flashbacks as predominantly physical or as comforting as this? What do they usually look like for you?"

DarkAcademia,fqkztwp,t3_ghqgnm,1589441410.0,"As much as I would love to tell you to run flash cards with a human skull by candlelight while sipping absinthe from an amber sherry glass, the truth is that if you‚Äôre having trouble getting motivated, focusing on the aesthetic will probably only motivate you for a very short time and ultimately just distract you in the long term. Not to mention the absinthe would just completely annihilate your information retention on sight. 
To get motivated you‚Äôll just need one thing, a mirror. (For aesthetic reasons I‚Äôd recommend a gilded silver one, but any antique will do) The reason you‚Äôll need the mirror is because you‚Äôll need to re-condition your mind to enjoy the idea of studying itself. It is 100% possible to retrain your brain, and it really doesn‚Äôt take that long once you start, so long as you‚Äôre diligent about doing it every time you sit down to study. 
First, start by looking yourself in the eye, and isolating the reason why you don‚Äôt want to study. There‚Äôs probably a reason why you dread studying (and that‚Äôs ok!), so isolate that dread and fight it with a hopeful phrase. For instance, I don‚Äôt like studying because I dread wasting time and not learning anything, so that fear stops me from even starting. So the hopeful phrase that I would fight with is something like, ‚ÄúWhen I study today I might learn something new, and if I learn even just one thing then it won‚Äôt be a waste of time.‚Äù It‚Äôs important that you focus on repeating the hopeful phrase (you don‚Äôt need to focus on the reason for the dread since that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre trying to forget), and make sure it becomes a ritual for every time you sit down to study.
Remember, the key is to internalize the hope. Keep repeating it until you believe it (this is also why making eye contact with yourself is important, as well as acknowledging that it‚Äôs you that you‚Äôre looking at.) You may have to repeat it a couple times to internalize it and make yourself believe it, and sometimes a hopeful phrase can be a little too far fetched and you‚Äôll want to bring it in a little bit. For instance the hopeful phrase, ‚ÄúIf I study I‚Äôll become a millionaire,‚Äù while hopeful, is too big a goal. Maybe one day you will be, but to get there start with something small that you can take one step at a time. Base it in truth, and in real attainable hopes that you have for your future. Sometimes a hopeful phrase can be a little bit too much at once emotionally as well, and you won‚Äôt be able to internalize it right away because you‚Äôve lived with a lot of dread for a long time. That‚Äôs ok too. Allow yourself the freedom to change your phrase as needed, and to take breaks. And also just know that it‚Äôs okay to cry too. A lot of people struggle with procrastination and dread of studying, and personally, I believe that the dread of studying in most cases can be traced back to a lot of negativity within an educational environment (ex: fear of disappointing your parents with low grades, feeling shame of failing when getting a lower grade than you hoped for, teacher‚Äôs being negative and mean, school bullies, etc) being internalized at a young age that then becomes beliefs a student might start having about themselves or about learning that they carry for years because they don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre carrying it. And then, because of those beliefs, learning physically can‚Äôt be fun (until we recondition the brain with positive reinforcement of hopeful truth) because our brains have been conditioned through negative reinforcement to slow down and stop (you know, like how procrastinating looks) because to the brain studying equals pain, fear, or danger coming. And sometimes (and not even just in extreme cases, this is just how to brain works) these fears can manifest as physical pain and sensations like headaches and sudden fatigue, eye strain, tension in the shoulders and neck (all of which may magically go away when you decide to do something else) because the emotional negativity around education was traumatic enough to the brain that it is now sending urgent messages to the body saying ‚ÄúSlow down! Stop! Before you get hurt!‚Äù 
Now, I could be way off base here because this may not be your case at all. And if so, please forgive me for running off at the mouth. But because it is so incredibly common a phenomena, I thought I‚Äôd mention it just in case you or someone else saw this comment and needed to hear it, because I know I did. And if that is you, I just want you to know that it‚Äôs okay and that you don‚Äôt have to live like this anymore. Just take it one day at a time and start as small as you need to, keep repeating those hopeful phrases to yourself and soon you‚Äôll not only love studying and learning, but your joy and love of the dark academia aesthetic will have nowhere to go but to flow out into your joy of other things like your newfound joy of studying. And soon, beautiful note-taking styles will just come naturally out of you because you love what you‚Äôre doing.
I‚Äôm so sorry that this was long winded, but I really do hope this helps, and if you want to get really fancy to get started, I think a nice piece of parchment paper would be a wonderful idea to write down your hopeful phrases on, and you could even use a human skull as a paperweight to hold it on your desk by your mirror. I just know your studies are going to go great üñ§üñ§üñ§"

Ever since the crusades, Capitalists have hidden behind Christianity and twisted it to use guilt and fear as a sales tactic. If it were Christianity‚Äôs fault that this was a problem, then there would not be clear instructions against this kind of behavior in the Bible. However, in Capitalist literature, this kind of behavior is encouraged. To blame Christianity for Capitalisms downfalls is like blaming Islam for ISIS. Capitalists twist what is in the Bible and pretend to be missionaries in order to travel to places and invade untapped markets, and then when that no longer works as a marketing tactic, they use the faith as a scapegoat to get them out of trouble. Just because someone calls themselves a Christian doesn‚Äôt mean they are. Their behavior tells the truth about their motivations.

My grandma had the most influence on my taste in music, she used to listen to classical music and jazz on her record player and soon I was listening to Dave Brubeck, Tchaikovsky, Wagner, and Dvorak. My mom used to listen to The Beatles with her dad, and I‚Äôve been working on restoring her collection of Beatles vinyls.

It IS important to acknowledge lost children, they ARE important and they DO matter because their loss deeply impacts those who‚Äôve lost them. Loss of a child is not one-and-done grief.

Also just a side note just because I feel like everybody who lives with roommates needs to understand this: 
   If you say, ‚ÄúI was planning to clean it up‚Äù but you never did, that is a wildly unacceptable behavior. That is something that children say to their parents, and should never be roommate to roommate. By saying that, you‚Äôre trying to manipulate the person who is upset with you into feeling as though you‚Äôve already cleaned it up even if you leave the mess sitting there for months. This is emotionally manipulative and if you do this you need to stop, and if you have roommates who do this you need to find better ones. The fact of the matter is, if you were actually considerate of the other people in the living space, and were actually planning to clean it up, than you would have done so immediately after you had finished whatever it was you made a mess doing, regardless of the time of day. And you would have done so not because you resent your roommates and want them off your back, but because you actually care about your roommate‚Äôs comfort in the living space, and you want to respect their boundaries concerning the conditions of common areas.
   Now if you forgot about a mess and they called you on it, the respectful thing to say would be, ‚ÄúThank you, I‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù and to then clean it up immediately when you become physically able to.

OP is not homophobic, and we have clear evidence of that in her original post. Even if we didn‚Äôt have that evidence we could make a pretty strong assumption that if she were homophobic then she probably would not be so concerned about being an asshole over distributing jewelry that she already has reserved for a specific reason. She clearly loves and accepts her future son in law and has made an effort to welcome him into the family by making sure that her gifts to him, as well as all of her gifts to her other children, their spouses, and their children (including the grandchildren that may come from this marriage) are all equal and show neither favoritism nor lack of love. Your unfounded accusation of being a homophobe against this woman who is clearly doing the best she can with a demanding son in law frankly weakens any bigger argument you want to make. If you want so badly to talk about subtle homophobia, please find legitimate cases of micro-aggressions and discuss it there. They are out there and they are a very real problem that needs to be talked about, but they are not present in this specific case, so it‚Äôs inappropriate to keep talking about it here."

The reason your father in law gave you for the tradition is complete bullshit, if men came home and were so hungry from working all day that they forced the others to watch while they wolfed down all the food, what benefit would it be to have a husband in the first place who‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs supposed to PROVIDE FOOD and other necessities during a time when women couldn‚Äôt work. What use would there be for those husbands? What benefit could there possibly be for the family, if the women eat cold leftovers at best, and at worst starve? The only thing this does is constantly tell the women that all they deserve is scraps and that they are worthless. This is a tradition formed by a family of useless men that should be ashamed of themselves for perpetuating it.

secret,fnae6ra,t1_fn8qy2p,1586795936.0,"But I do have direction and meaning. I chose a relationship with God over a romance with her and because those two things were in conflict with each other my heart and my brain are no longer torn between the two. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt so clear at the end of my post but I‚Äôm not only happy but I‚Äôm also much healthier now.

I do appreciate your concern for me, but I will say that I certainly have reflected on whether or not my religion helps me live better than I would living with her. And the original post was sort of a catharsis as a result of that reflection.

[You don‚Äôt have to read the rest of this unless you‚Äôre really interested in how I got there, but the rest of this comment will basically be what my thought process looked like and how I came to the conclusions that I did.]

So, it‚Äôs a comparative question that I ended up asking myself, ‚ÄúWould my life be better?‚Äù So I went ahead and started making some comparisons. 
First, I weighed what my life is like now. It‚Äôs not a bad life. I‚Äôm lonely occasionally, but on the whole I‚Äôm happy and free. I did go through a season where I was excruciatingly lonely for a long time, I had a series of toxic relationships with men, and they really made me start to question whether or not I was making the right choice. However, I realized through those experiences that loneliness occurs within relationships as well. So if loneliness was my number 1 issue, (which it was at the time when I first started having stronger feelings for her) if I were pining for her simply because of my loneliness, then a relationship would not actually be a viable solution. Instead, I concluded, I needed to do some work on myself. 
Then, I weighed what my life would be like if I were in a relationship with her, and I realized that most of this is in my head. Nothing is guaranteed to play out in any certain way, and no conjectures I can make actually mean anything if I don‚Äôt account for her feelings on the matter and how she‚Äôs actually wrestling with it. She‚Äôs already in a happy and healthy committed relationship with someone else. Certainly she would have some reservations just from that alone. And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that just because I had a thought one day that we could be married does not mean it would actually happen. But, I said to myself, let‚Äôs say for the sake of argument that it did, let‚Äôs say that she dumped her lovely fianc√© and then the two of us lived happily married. Is the quality of my life improved by that alone? After doing a lot of research and work on my own mental health, I came to the conclusion that, no it wouldn‚Äôt. I even factored out the obvious negative variables like how our families would take it and what that would do to our support systems, what it would do to my relationships at church. I figured for the sake of argument, best case scenario, those things aren‚Äôt impacted, so I just focused on the relationship itself and what the impact that would have on my life and way of living. I realized that the act of simply just having a romance, whether it is heterosexual or homosexual, does not inherently improve or deteriorate the quality of one‚Äôs life. Quality of life is measured by whether you have a support system, a steady income, a place to live and food to eat, and the health of your relationships. And the quality of those relationships relies on things like what communication looks like inside of them, and whether there is fidelity, and I think most importantly there needs to be full conviction if the relationships are going to work out. In order for a relationship to work, both partners need to be fully convicted of their love for one another. In this specific case my convictions were split. I loved her, but I also love a God who has told me to refrain from homosexuality. To put it in perspective, to me it would be like I were dating two people at the same time and one of them was very clear that they were not cool with it. That would not be ok with me.
So I found myself in what looked like no-win. I had to choose between the two. If I chose her then I would eventually find myself resenting her because I‚Äôd have given up my God, who has always been with me and who I love very much, for her. If I gave up her, who I have had in my life for a long time and who I also love very much, I‚Äôd find myself resenting God for having to give her up. Ultimately, I realized that if I am going to resent someone, it should be God because that‚Äôs part of His job. He told us to do so when He died on the cross and was resurrected. He is capable of carrying the bad feelings like resentment and hatred and anger because he defeated them on the cross and He is capable of transforming them into healing and happiness because He is God. Whereas she is not God, and she is not capable of any of that and she will most definitely get hurt by my resentment for her, and it will break both of our hearts.
So after coming to this conclusion a while ago and processing this for a couple of years now, I‚Äôve seen that by choosing God and by so doing, also choosing to resent God instead of resenting her, that the resent itself has indeed been rendered incapable of doing the damage that it could have done in either of our lives. Slowly, that resent is being replaced by a gratitude for having loved in a different way than I thought I could before I knew her, and now I‚Äôm seeing God turn this potentially very tragic situation into one that has produced health and happiness in my life where before I either felt nothing or had felt confusion and sadness. I am also now able to look at all of my relationships through a different lens and I know so much more about myself and what I truly desire out of a relationship.
So in answer to my original question, ‚ÄúWould my life be better?‚Äù My personal results have shown me that my life is objectively better than it was before I made a choice and I have also noticed that by choosing a path to grow I have matured a lot and God has done a lot of healing in my heart. However, I have discovered that the original question is flawed in that what is most important here is the effect my choices have on the people in my life as opposed to how I will personally benefit from my choices. Therefore I believe the new question should be, if I have to choose between religion and a human relationship again, ‚ÄúWho can I have faith in to make this right if I don‚Äôt make a good choice?‚Äù"
AmItheAsshole,fn8nr5u,t3_fzykl6,1586745869.0,"NTA - Lice is a health concern, the fact that it‚Äôs gotten to the point where this is really the only viable option for you, is appalling. Your parents are being neglectful letting it get this bad and you are well within your rights to take your own health into your own hands at any point. Them blaming you for their own shame is projection. It just proves that they know they‚Äôve been neglectful and have been trying to hide it. It‚Äôs not your responsibility that they are not properly taking care of you. They are fully in the wrong here.
Now, as far as getting a job is concerned, if a job doesn‚Äôt want to hire you just because your hair is short you really don‚Äôt want to work for them anyway. That being said, it shouldn‚Äôt actually be an issue. People shave their heads all the time because of health reasons (which this is), and as someone who‚Äôs shaved her head before I can tell you that the pixie cut will come in fast. You‚Äôre going to be okay on that front."

AmItheAsshole,fdz9uor,t3_en90gx,1578788070.0,"I don‚Äôt think anyone is being an asshole here. I think there might just be some preconceived notions on both sides and some perspective is needed all around. 
So, I‚Äôm bisexual and a Christian. I grew up Christian, however I decided as an adult who had come to terms with my sexuality to continue believing in Christ. I personally make a strong effort to study the Bible and understand completely what it is that I‚Äôm saying I believe in. I don‚Äôt sign contracts I haven‚Äôt read yet, and I know for a fact that there is absolutely nothing in the Bible that says that being attracted to the same sex and being a Christian are mutually exclusive. Being lgbtq+ is not a matter of eternal significance. It will not cost you your salvation. Period. 
However, because of our post-quaker, ashamed-of-all-types-of-sex society and media portrayals of both sides of this conversation, I can completely understand why people on both sides might think that being gay is a non-starter for Christianity. There is a lot of scripture taken out of context to demonize and manufacture shame on both sides of this conversation. Personally, I‚Äôm very comfortable with my sexuality, and have been for years, but because of these prejudices, there are a lot of people, both in my family and in my church who I cannot come out to because they are not safe. 
For instance, I have an aunt who is a lesbian who, when I was a young adult in college, blocked me because I was a Christian. She didn‚Äôt ask me any questions about it, she just did it as soon as she realized. Now, I had been raised a Christian, it wasn‚Äôt a secret to anyone in the family, but for some reason, when I was an adult mentioning that I was a Christian was a problem for her. I now (obviously) have a strained relationship with her because she believes that I believe something about her and about our lgbtq+ community that I don‚Äôt actually believe and can‚Äôt believe (because it would not only make me a hypocrite, but it would also be contrary to the gospel itself, which would defeat the whole purpose of being a Christian in the first place). And she will not be convinced of the truth of either my sexuality or that I don‚Äôt mean her any ill will simply because of her prejudice against the church.
Now the most surprising thing to me has been on the other side of that. In my church I‚Äôve found a community of believers who are also lgbtq+ and I have never felt so seen and understood by a group of people in my life. I thought I was the only one, and I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm not alone.
I‚Äôm begging you, please don‚Äôt be like my aunt. It‚Äôs important to realize that teenagers and young adults, and honestly anybody younger than you, is probably not going to have the same maturity level as you. They‚Äôre probably not going to be able to explain a concept that they‚Äôre struggling to wrap their brains around and make sense of in a way that isn‚Äôt going to be triggering for you, especially if it‚Äôs something that you have past or shared trauma in. They don‚Äôt know what they don‚Äôt know. They don‚Äôt know the key phrases that are bad or good, they don‚Äôt know the nuances yet or the appropriate vocabulary or why certain things should be done certain ways. These come with perspective, and that perspective is gained from living life.
You clearly care very much about your niece so it‚Äôs important to not ruin your relationship with her just because, as young person, she‚Äôs making some decisions about her beliefs that make you uncomfortable right now. If she continues to believe in Christ, then I strongly believe He‚Äôll do the same thing in her heart that He‚Äôs done in mine and soften her heart towards the community and give her that desperately needed perspective. Something that I‚Äôve learned through this journey and my search for safe people, is that I have become so much more comfortable with my sexuality, and all of the questions that come from that, through pressing into a relationship with Christ than I ever have from pressing into any other relationship I‚Äôve ever had, especially those of a sexual or romantic nature. Most of all, I‚Äôve learned the most about both my sexuality and my God after I was out of school completely and living on my own as a fully realized adult. 
I think she‚Äôll get there, she‚Äôs just a little immature right now. What she needs the most is patience and understanding that this is a difficult concept for most people to wrap their minds around. But, times are changing, and we have resources now, and it‚Äôs okay to look in lots of different sources and use your best judgement to find answers. And, learning is a life-long process so it‚Äôs okay to change your mind as you learn more about it and gain different perspectives."

AmItheAsshole,exvevyc,t3_cucz2s,1566598364.0,"You aren‚Äôt and you are. I can understand why you‚Äôd be concerned if she brings him up all the time and then he knew her by name when she wasn‚Äôt there. I think Y definitely TA when you confronted him while on the clock, a conversation like that should never take place while the other person is working because they can‚Äôt get away from you or give an honest account of what‚Äôs going on because they‚Äôre in customer service mode. Their job is at risk over a misunderstanding. That‚Äôs why he was laughing dude, you trapped him and he was nervous. That was pretty messed up.
That being said, I don‚Äôt know how long you and your GF have been together but if you have any history of being cheated on by others then you might be either bringing that into your current relationship and projecting onto her, OR you might be seeing some real red flags. 
Listen, we are strangers on the internet, and we don‚Äôt know your whole story. And while your execution in this instance was very poor, I think you were triggered for a very real reason and you should try not to label yourself an asshole on the whole for this particular bad moment, but instead, try to sincerely apologize to her and make amends and then maybe get some counseling to find the root of why you were seeing the patterns you‚Äôre seeing. Because based off your post it does seem to me like something is fishy here and I don‚Äôt think this is all your fault. You kind of had a right to be insecure about this. The pattern you were seeing does look a heck of a lot like a pattern that leads to cheating, however that doesn‚Äôt actually mean that cheating is going to take place. Those in the comments mocking you for not trusting your GF, well, I mean there‚Äôs a reason you‚Äôre not married yet, right? Trust is built over time, and during struggles, and dating is that time when you learn whether or not you can trust someone with your heart. You‚Äôre not a bad guy for not leaning on her every word like it‚Äôs the truth in stone because you‚Äôre still in the part of the relationship where you‚Äôre learning whether or not you can do that. I don‚Äôt care what these guys say, you‚Äôre never going to be an asshole for just not trusting someone else. People can be sketchy sometimes.  Just next time, instead of cornering someone while they‚Äôre on the clock, ask for them and their significant other, and for your girlfriend and yourself to go get some coffee together instead. If something is off, then you‚Äôll establish yourself as The Boyfriend without also establishing yourself as The Caveman, as well as alert their significant other to the suspicious chemistry without even having to say a word. And if it‚Äôs all kosher, then you‚Äôll have a lovely double date and make new friends."

But to tell the truth, as a woman it does feel true to me in a way, just not in the ‚Äúshe should be grateful and pick one already!‚Äù kind of way. Please let me explain.
I often find myself in this position, there‚Äôs a handful of guys that I know would love to be romantic with me but I don‚Äôt want them near me because they make me uncomfortable for a variety of reasons (including but not limited to: I‚Äôm not attracted to them and have already told them no and they‚Äôre still trying; they use racist slurs/have offensive viewpoints; they have a short and violent temper; they don‚Äôt function at the same cognitive level as I do and their unpredictability means that we couldn‚Äôt have meaningful conversation without me being in fear of my safety even if we tried; they‚Äôre very outspoken about only wanting sex from me; they talk to me in a derogatory way; they body shame and talk about other women in a derogatory way in front of me; they flirt with other women in front of me and tell me I should be okay with it; they try to control me, how I react to them, what I eat, what I say; they encourage me to compromise my beliefs and standards; and overall, they don‚Äôt treat me as an individual human with thoughts and feelings of my own, they just want to show me off to their friends to prove themselves the most alpha male and then, like a houseplant shoved in a dark corner, neglect my needs and leave me to fend for myself for affection that I‚Äôll never get.) The constant barrage of this kind of thing sends a message to my brain telling me that this is all I‚Äôm gonna get, so I should just try to settle for the one that‚Äôs the least violent and the most attentive. But that just makes me feel even more lonely and isolated, and furthermore, depressed because, what the fuck? Is that really all I have access to? And I think about knowing that I‚Äôm not even going to be seen as a human being even by the one that I might settle for, no matter what I give him, he‚Äôll never actually give a shit because he didn‚Äôt, just like none of them did, in the first place. 
As someone who‚Äôs lived a life full of failed and utterly broken and awful relationships and friendships for the past 9 years, this is unfortunately a perfect image of my reality. I see all the guys, trying to force their way into my life, through my door without being invited with their ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a nice guy‚Äù roses, and I have to be firm in boundaries I set to keep them out of my heart so I don‚Äôt get steamrolled by them all and block the door. I see their efforts to bypass my boundaries, and I see their intentions to use me, and I know that I‚Äôm not seen by a single fucking one of them as a person, no matter what they might say to the contrary, and it makes me feel inconsequential and low and disposable.
So, I just want to say thank you to everyone for calling out the incel attitude behind this post because it‚Äôs affirming to me as someone who is trying to recover from the thought and lie that I must settle for an unhappy and likely abusive relationship in order to receive love. Sincerely, thank you, because it‚Äôs easier to internalize the truth that I deserve better when there are people like you guys around to confirm and vindicate me."
