It's really important to remember your own needs, not just his. There is a fine line between his anger being due to his mental health and due to him being an aggressive
person, so if he crosses the line don't just sweep it under the carpet.

Honestly what I always wanted was just to lay in bed and cuddle sometimes, vent for a little while and just talk with my SO. Just try keep him distracted for most of the time, if he's doing something enjoyable or working on something he'll have less time to get upset or think about problems. 

Another idea that may be worth a try is (this is not always a good option, it depends on the person) when your boyfriend is feeling really down, ask him if he wants some time to himself; this may seem counterintuitive but sometimes a guy just wants to sit alone for a while and think. Let him know that if he needs you to just come find you and go do something nice for yourself. 

Just remember to be uplifting and supporting; but keep your own needs in mind too, you don't have to set yourself on fire to keep others warm.

I wish you both the best."
