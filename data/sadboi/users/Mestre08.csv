AskReddit,fiq2jlq,t1_fipzggt,1582632941.0,"Intentionally using the wrong words? No. That's you placing intent behind something you believe to be happening.

I'm going to try to explain this to you. Let's use public schools that don't have tuitions. We would call these free. Now, part of taxes goes to paying these schools so that there doesn't have to be tuitions. The ""price"" paid within our peraonal taxes that goes to schools is negligible. Its cents. Effectively if I have my child attend said schools I will not be paying what tuition would be through my taxes. The country pays for this. In essence this is free for me. Not the country but me the private citizen. Those cents out of my taxes that go into paying for this by themselves are meaningless. It's when you combine them with cents from everyone that you get meaningful quantities. In your opinion you believe people who use the word free to discribe this situation as malicious when in fact, to them it is essentially free. You see if I choose to have my kids go to a private school my taxes won't change to reflect the fact that my kid isn't in a public one.

Is this the absolute definition of free? Maybe not. But it's applicable in the circumstances. It reflects that the value I'm receiving is not equal to the money I'm paying. That's why when, sometimes, you find something with a huge discount like 90% off people say ""it's basically free"".

Words have definitions. Yes. But humans use words adapted to their circumstances. We mold them and use them freely. That's why you get things like ""that's sick"". This doesn't mean that whatever its referring to is ill though that's the literal definition."
AskReddit,fiplmok,t1_fipa5kw,1582610922.0,"No buddy. Words serve us not the other way around. Free is a concept that adapts to circumstances. Nothing is truly free. It's free within the reality in which It exists.

Harry had to be led to Slytherin's common room and Ravenclaws as well. Under this system if you are found close to a door that isn't yours everyone is going to notice... anyways I find that going in there to talk to Justin Finch-Fletchly would be a good reason.
AskReddit,fenqd9h,t1_fennc76,1579289238.0,">     Harry knows it was a Gryffindor (or a guest of a Gryffindor) who stole the diary

Except if you are coming in and out with friends they will know the password making it so it can easily be told to others.

> Harry stashed his broom in a place where only a Gryffindor could allow access to

Not if others can get into the common room. The broom is stashed under his bed which can be accessed through the common room.

> Malfoy would never invite Harry and Ron into his common room anyway, so that plot point remains the same

Malfoy doesn't have to. The password system crumbles once others are allowed to enter with friends.

> Justin Finch-Fletchly hiding was a Hufflepuff, so Harry could have followed him into his passworldless common room anyway -- he just didn't want to, so that ""plot point"" is unchanged

Again that's incorrect, the Hufflepuff common room is accessed by a rhythmic code which if done incorrectly will drench the person in vinegar. Harry did want to find Justin that's why he goes to the library to see if he's there.

>  no one was even going to give Sirius a password, so that isn't changed

Again password system crumbles under this ""friends can come in"" system. If a Slytherin could have helped Black I'm sure a few would have. 

The point of common rooms is to create a sense of identity and family between members of the house. McGonagall describes the houses has their school family.

That's just what comes to mind but I'm sure there's more... But to counterpoint the visitor notion, the castle is huge why can't they just meet up somewhere else? The 7 story castle with an absurd amount of space and people have to go to the one-room they can't?"
