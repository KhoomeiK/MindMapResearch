bipolar,fm1ht3d,t3_frw20m,1585678677.0,I was on olanzapine for mania and had that side effect too. All I can say is speak to your psych and ask to be switched. When I went off it myself I went completely manic. And it's not worth running that risk

bipolar,fm1hjbd,t3_frzuut,1585678535.0,Are you in the UK? Only I am too and I know a bit about the system so if you have questions feel free to DM. Hypomania is dangerous because judgment can be impaired. With me it always escalates into mania but I'm not sure about type 2 so maybe its more easy to live with it that way in some respects. It's normal to experience hypomania while on meds as long as you can harness it and keep it under control. Im not sure about the last question as I'm more familiar with mania than hypomania.
bipolar,fm1h8lc,t3_fs0fg0,1585678379.0,"I saw it. I found it hard to watch  and not very accurate. Ben didn't display typical manic symptoms like pressured speech, flight of ideas, euphoria. I would like to see that in a TV show. But yes I agree with you. I would like people to love me off meds too. Even if I seem more normal on lithium."

bipolar,fm1gpvl,t3_fs4xo1,1585678106.0,Lithium hasn't made me gain weight and I do feel okay and normal on it. I don't experience the highs or lows just mildly. I miss the mild highs but that's another story. I get cognitive issues with my thoughts being jumbled but otherwise lithium has pretty much saved me..I never thought I could be this stable on a drug. I tried probably over twenty meds and they didn't help or they helped only for a few months. I have had all manner of side effects but on lithium my only side effect is thirst and urination. When I'm unmedicated I'm surefire manic and it's no way to live. I ruin everything I touch.
bipolar,fm1gh8h,t3_fs58g8,1585677978.0,Yeah honestly I deal with this too. Lithium keeps me stable but I don't like taking it. I literally think of the worst possible outcome of me not taking it eg hospital or jail and I force myself to take it
bipolar,fm1g7tv,t3_fs5vyo,1585677840.0,I'm not sure. It depends. I often crash after mania into depression. But when I was on the depot injection of flupentixol last summer I didn't crash I just went into a mixed state and then stabilised a bit.
bipolar,fm1g408,t3_fs61n9,1585677783.0,"I have only been diagnosed last summer since my first mania but I have been dealing with the beast since I was 14 and it has only gotten harder, saying that it has gotten easier since I started lithium in January and felt a lot more stable and dulled"
bipolar,fm1fwyy,t3_fs6m35,1585677681.0,I saw the show. I have been violent like Ben has but he didn't show any of the typical manic euphoria or pressured speech or flight of ideas. So I don't think it was a good representation. He just got violent and flipped out which is not what mania is.
bipolar,fm1frah,t3_fs70jz,1585677598.0,I'm not sure. It's rare to rapid cycle within hours. Usually rapid cycling is 4+ episodes a year.
bipolar,fm1fole,t3_fs06tg,1585677560.0,When I had my first mania I found music helped with the racing thoughts. I'd listen to the same songs on Spotify on my phone over and over again out loud and it would help

bipolar,fm0z5ir,t3_fsc320,1585669005.0,I was there last summer for 3 months and then for a month this January. It was horrible but did save my life because I got put on lithium which made me stable if a little dulled. Corona thing is so hard when you have bipolar. Socialising is importwnt for us. Hopefully they will find a vaccine soon. Stay safe
bipolar,fm0z0ey,t3_fs9dqv,1585668925.0,"Sending love. Remember this virus thing will pass eventually and they'll most likely find a vaccine and we will get our lives back. Bipolar makes it all doubly hard. Sometimes it helps to think of my bipolar as a superpower in the way that it gives me empathy, rich emotions and creativity, although of course it's incredibly destructive too."
bipolar,fm0yew8,t1_fm0g0p1,1585668598.0,I know exactly what you mean. The delusions can be beautiful at least for me. Yes it all ruins your life and mania is destructive but it's also intensely sensational and makes you think deeper.
bipolar,fm0gmd3,t3_fsbn5s,1585657155.0,I hate taking my lithium because I feel dull and boring and honestly I prefer being manic or hypomanic even though it ruins my life
