depression,fjggl84,t3_fdbl3e,1583325965.0,"I've been in your boat before and gotten out. Then I've gotten back in. Now I'm out again! If you care about your mental health (which you obviously do), don't be afraid to switch therapists or doctors or medications if they are not helping you. Reach out to friends / family and let them know you need a support system. Its a really great feeling knowing that there's people who DO want you to feel better and not just yourself. 

You'll always have ups and downs in life but you don't want to let a chemical imbalance stop you from enjoying the good things, and making the bad things much worse. If you can, please try to give it 5 years and see the improvement. Because if you want it you can have it. I promise!"
