I’m so sorry for you, what about being a volunteer or big brother sort of thing so you can fulfill your needs in being there for foster kids, a CASA is a court appointed special advocate that is very rewarding.  Maybe perhaps go to couples therapy.  If you get married perhaps you will be putting her first but she may not reciprocate.  I’m glad she told you this before you had kids in your house too, I apologize if I’m being harsh on her but a good relationship both parties need to compromise make sacrifices on both parts..... good luck and god bless your heart there are few people in the world that want to go on the path of foster parenting/ adoption.
