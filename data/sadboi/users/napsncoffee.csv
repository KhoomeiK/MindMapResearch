medicalmarijuana,fp49l79,t3_g9h0fh,1588294433.0,I think he started with them but then the price came up more than advertised (or was told). So he bailed on them.

medicalmarijuana,fouppxr,t3_g9h0fh,1588088343.0,My husband just did this last Monday (virtually) and had his card by Thursday. It cost him a total of $200. He used QuickMedCards.com.

EKGs,fagvpua,t3_e8raju,1576072679.0,Current EKG student here. Am I looking at an AV block in V1? I think I'm seeing extra p waves within or interrupting t waves. Without measuring- what I think are p waves looks to have a regular rhythm. Am I seeing that correctly?

confession,eyqdul6,t3_cy6izb,1567339124.0,"Teachers Aide here. This happened in my kindergarten room last year and it happened in my class numerous times. It started with one kid, then two, then five. This is a huge pain in the ass. I would be the one who had to search through the stack of germ covered iPads to figure out which ones were alarming. Those things aren't as easy to narrow down as it might seem."
space,ewooeyn,t3_cp5yit,1565622979.0,Thank you for this visualization. I've always struggled when trying to help my children with their studies. Now all the pictures make sense! Weird what it takes for the brain to comprehend sometimes.

They will say ""bless you"" at first but I told them years ago that they don't need to keep repeating themselves. My fits will usually last about 5 minutes. 3-4 sneezes then a 30 second break in between. It's annoying as hell."
