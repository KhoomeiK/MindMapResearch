 He and Dennis wrote magic mushrooms growers guide together and Dennis released ""Brotherhood of the screaming Abyss"" , can't wait to get that one. Not cheap unfortunately, I am currently neck deep in Philip K Dick's work and am now truly obsessed beyond measure, I checked out PKD at the advice of Terence and really you can see parallels in alot of what Terence says in his talks and what Philip was all about...sorry I went off subject a tad but yeah, Terence changed my life, my mind and some of my being . Philip has changed my entire being and really I'm just so freaking thankful to have found Terence and now PKD. Right now I'm listening to the exegesis of PKD every day over and over during my daily life. Game changer IMO..like everything game changer ..."

BPD,euexd92,t1_euerq9c,1563756587.0,"Thank you! Yes,.fortunately I don't believe he was gaslighting, I think he was offended that I was hurt by an incident a day ago(didn't share then cause we were having a good moment), and shared it at the worst time (while we were grocery shopping today) as I was triggered by an event then...I was visibly moved from my happy bubbly demeanor (I'm the quiet type bpd/rarely explode, but when I do, not good) anywho I became sad and sort of passive aggressive as well when I ""shared"" (he says projection) and maybe I was projecting but I just didn't know how to share my feelings even though I could except they were wrong and I perceived wrong...I'm okay with that fact and being told that truth (mind is broken)

 I just want a ""oh honey I'm sorry you felt that, I didn't know you perceived it that way and were hurt"" or something like that would be nice but it's not like they can read minds or I can tell him what to say...so I understand that too. 

I just wanted to feel cared about in that moment but his reaction didn't feel like caring, I perceived that I fmessed up and made him mad and now more likely to leave me(feeling like a narc too!)...Of course I SPLIT big time and  am planning my new life at the  moment as I still split  🙄...

ugh, off to tomorrow! At least it's a new day right 🙃😊💖 hang in there BPD friends, this shit does royally suck."

BPD,eu5l83u,t3_ceuoyk,1563479916.0,"Well, in all the hardships has there been any good that you can take away from it all and build upon it.

 I think one of the strengths and abilities that many BPD persons have is that we can reinvent ourselves and adapt to just about anything/ situation, yes our dark times and perceived screw ups can be very dark and seemingly hopeless...but it would seem that we have an uncanny ability to find an optimistic viewpoint and move on some how? 

Im surprised every day that I made it this far , speaking for myself but am starting to learn that maybe I should be less hard on self and give at least some credit. I know it's hard now, but can you try to see some light in all of this?

Also, I think our shadow defines the light 😊💖💞🌼🌷🦋"

I just wanted to save the broken child within her and help her feel loved and cared for, heal those wounds for her ...I know I'm hurting myself holding onto this, still caring..your strength is so inspiring!"

There is actually nothing wrong with my person or my life, no complaints..I just don't have a will to live or want to be here but somehow I'm stuck in this role as a wife and mom who is so happy and is really good at pretending they have their shit together and is a happy person.

 My son deserves better and I hope one day he'll get a better mom who isn't so crazy, my husband has tried everything and really we are no match. He's very strong, positive and able to achieve anything, very in control of his mind/feelings.. I am so confused as to why I just hate existing..can relate to many comments here"
