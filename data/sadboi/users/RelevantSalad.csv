Pitt,fpm8spg,t1_fpm7dxi,1588727901.0,Oh that’s awesome! Thanks so much that’s great to hear
Pitt,fpkzpl5,t3_gdsgc5,1588703829.0,"Yeah, still waiting for one class sadly :( I'm thinking the prof just didn't even get the grade in on time. it's an english class"
premed,fp6qw2z,t1_fp6pty1,1588357031.0,"oh! Didn’t know that, cool thank you!"
premed,fp6p20a,t1_fp6m7eo,1588356128.0,"Ah, I see. But doesn’t AMCAS also require you to check a box if it was online or something like that? The course number is exactly the same which is good, so it’ll show up as the regular 1 sem class on my transcript"
premed,fp6lk0t,t3_gbmdfw,1588354418.0,Congratulations!!!!!
premed,fnev2qk,t1_fneid47,1586896367.0,It’s soooo annoying right?? like this shouldn’t have to be something I’m worrying about now but...it is
Anxiety,fl5m27w,t3_fkayil,1584839993.0,Yes! A billion times yes. I thought I was the only one thinking I couldn’t breathe normally all of a sudden but then I realized it was probably just me being nervous bc I don’t have any other symptoms
Jeopardy,fe8qjen,t3_enzqyr,1578929346.0,"yup, when I emailed as mentioned on above comment they said calls hadn’t been made yet. i was surprised too, but maybe they’re having delays or something- perhaps the GOAT tournament is throwing things off schedule? or they’re just doing stuff later. best of luck!"
Jeopardy,fds1ley,t1_fdrvy1p,1578692972.0,nope- I figured I already pushed my luck by emailing so I didn’t want to ask anything else. The sentence I quoted is all they said!
Jeopardy,fdpdt8k,t1_fdp9i9t,1578626083.0,Aw it’s all good! And yeah haha it was sooo scary to email i was so intimidated ahahaha. You as well!!
Jeopardy,fdp1qff,t3_elg1cn,1578617923.0,"Hey guys! I just emailed and they said the following: “We have not made the calls yet.  Keep fingers crossed!”

!! so keep hopes up !!"
premed,fdefg5g,t3_ekxyh0,1578337863.0,"the counselor position seems more unique, but go with what your interest really lies in. if you feel passionate about something , or if the hospital volunteering leads you to that ER experience that you really really want, I don’t think you could go wrong with either. esp since you’ll have paid clinical experience, too. Also, four hours a week is a pretty standard amount for volunteering. I’m only a sophomore too, and still figuring things out. I get the whole not wanting to mess up, aha. But do what you care about, and you’ll be great!"
Jeopardy,fd05qmk,t1_fczj23h,1578114025.0,Not here :(
Mcat,fcz8rfy,t3_ej819m,1578095959.0,"oh wait i think it says the dropbox was getting too many hits, so you have to go to the facebook group  [https://www.facebook.com/groups/mcatbros](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mcatbros) 

under the files tab i think

hope that helped !"
Mcat,fcz85pq,t3_ej819m,1578095612.0,i can't find it either :/ thought it was just me!
Jeopardy,fc2293g,t1_fbwmpmx,1577337529.0,omg wait I was at that one!
Jeopardy,fby6apt,t3_eetdvj,1577209137.0,"Yeah, haven’t heard anything. But at the Philly audition I vaguely remember them saying: “calls go out around Dec holidays, to beginning of January. Taping is early February so we wouldn’t give you less than a month’s notice.” It seems no one has heard anything so I’m holding out hope for January!"
Jeopardy,fao7lh1,t3_e69hys,1576258831.0,nothing here :( eagerly waiting
Jeopardy,f8dcbz2,t3_dzdvfd,1574485235.0,"Haven't heard back yet, but very eager to! I think it will be at least a little while longer, maybe a week or up to a month. It was just such a fun experience though ugh I'm so glad I got the chance to go!"
premed,eqg0cpy,t1_eqc5i6d,1560029901.0,That makes a lot of sense!! Thank you so much!
theyknew,eq03l80,t1_epzzvn0,1559677665.0,Good eye!!
premed,epzfogc,t1_epzfhlp,1559664738.0,Thanks so much!! I’m an English major and I actually keep a little journal when I volunteer to write down some thoughts so I’m excited to continue doing that. I really appreciate your in-depth answer!
bisexual,epz88jb,t3_bwpb06,1559660472.0,This is gold. I hope you get the chance to use that response someday soon in the future haha
bisexual,epz84cw,t3_bwp39q,1559660403.0,"Same. It’s so hard to imagine. Like I’m so hyper aware, now that I’m more sure in my identity- it’s like “look! at all these people! they’re amazing! how do you only like one type?” But that’s one of these human things I guess. You can’t ever truly live life from anyone else’s perspective other than your own"
theyknew,epz7qrq,t1_epz7i9t,1559660184.0,Pretty sure it’s a joke from a few years ago. Original poster I think said “to”. Lmao
lgbt,epz6p0r,t3_bwmmpg,1559659554.0,"This is so true- so many ppl in my community who came out to their seemingly ally parents,  and the parents said something along these lines"
lgbt,epz6bth,t3_bwfcbw,1559659332.0,This is so absolutely gorgeous. I can’t draw at all but this makes me want to try making something!
lgbt,epyx2w4,t3_bwkgdy,1559653229.0,"I'm not out to family, so to go, I took a volunteer shift for an organization I'm part of that has a table there and am just telling my parents I'm going to the city to volunteer. Hopefully they're not all too aware of when/where/what pride is...?"
Jeopardy,epywkrs,t3_bwjsvm,1559652868.0,"Honestly it’s so cool, to say we got to see history being made. My dad always talks about Ken, and how exciting it was to watch when he was getting into Jeopardy. Dad made me a fan, and now I got to watch this with him"
