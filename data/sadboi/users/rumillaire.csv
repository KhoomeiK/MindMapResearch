Girl groups like SNSD were widely accepted. I see the same thing now. I think BTS is a bigger target because their fandom here is huge, and the teenage fangirls are the loudest. Honestly a lot of their comments can be... Questionable at times, stan Twitter had a field day with some of them (ie. Halsey and Jimin). And again, that thing about not wanting to he associated with a 'rabid teen girl fanbase.' Can say that a lot of my friends felt the same way, even I did for a while. 

Plus, the macho culture--which was already bad--has just been amped up by a hundred. Men like BTS who talk openly about their emotions, love fashion, wear makeup, and do singing and dancing (and have a largely young female following)--that's a big no-no. 

This might also be just the people I've been exposed to, but even the 'socially acceptable' girl groups (excluding Twice, which seems to have a wonderful, sweet fanbase here) are victim to this. Objectification, you nasty, horrible thing.

BTSWorld,es4b00u,t3_c5tn4l,1561580883.0,"Update -- got past Jimin's stage. Here are some thoughts. 

Cons:

* I really don't like how they made the whole ""help Jimin recover"" thing into a game mission. I felt like that took away from the urgency of the situation. This should have been a straight narrative chapter.
* I don't like how Taehyung mentions calories. Calorie counting is a big factor in EDs, it doesn't really help at all with these issues.
* Hoseok's phone call afterwards talking about his abs issues was...a little weird. 

Pros:

* It didn't romanticize EDs or this unhealthy lifestyle. It clearly shows it's wrong and ends the scene with Taehyung and Manager encouraging Jimin to engage in a healthier lifestyle and eat more. I think this positive, more hopeful ending is good.
* Whatever anyone wants to think or say, this is a part of Jimin's story. I doubt this was included without his consent (but if it was...I hope they take it down right away), and this has been something he's been open about. Seeing that he was in a horrible place then, but was still able to recover is incredibly inspiring; I say this as someone who has encountered these issues and found hope in Jimin. If he wants to tell this story, let him. All I ask from Netmarble is a trigger warning, which I believe would benefit a lot of people.

Update -- They're working through the pronouns issue. Thank you Netmarble! Hoping this goes well for other translations of the game.

Update -- Played through more 'Another Story.' The more I get into it, the better it gets. Not as bad as I initially thought. But I do still think they could at least modify some of it to make it feel less stalker-y at some points.

Final thoughts: Stan Twitter overreacts a lot, but there are some valid points to be found so it's unfair to dismiss everything said there. I think we should just remember to give feedback in an orderly manner. Kudos to the fans that emailed Netmarble, and kudos to Netmarble for listening.

&#x200B;

Yo, okay I've been getting really some bad stress from stan twitter rn so I'm going here to express my thoughts. Long post ahead.

&#x200B;

Re: the pronouns. I do think that this could have been done a lot better. Apparently, in the Korean version, it's just 'manager' and I think they should have just stuck to that. Though I do agree this is especially difficult in languages such as Spanish (hoping things are going down alright on that side of things), but I think this could have been easily avoided in the English version. I blame the translators. Have seen people sending emails to Netmarble about it, and I am hoping they consider it, because it does suck and it can be triggering for some.

&#x200B;

Re: Jimin. I haven't gotten to that stage of the game yet, so I can't comment on it. I do think they could have done with some content warnings (I feel the same way about 'Save Me' and HYYH in general, actually, long standing complaint of mine with BH), as again, this could be something triggering for some players. I think it's unfair to say it shouldn't be included, as it is a part of Jimin's history, and something he has been very open about; I just think it could have used a warning. But again, take into account that I haven't reached this part. I hope they add the warnings to the play store/app store description, at least, but I don't think that it's inherently wrong to put it there too.

&#x200B;

Re: the creepiness. Translator problem. Korean one looked fine. Next.

&#x200B;

Re: the Y/N-ness of it all. This is a little more subjective and personal, so take it with a grain of salt. But I think it's fine. I do think that some things are a little weird and touchy, but it's not as horrible as it could have been (again, the creepiness seems to come from the translators). Also, it's basically a Otome isual Novel-KDrama. The former will always have a hint of 'Y/N-ness' to it, it's a core element of that medium. And going into it, I really thought we all kind of knew that it would have Y/N elements to it, and would just take it in stride as a joke. It's basically the BTS/KDrama version of an anime visual novel. Most of them are like this. In fact, a lot are even creepier. It was bound to happen. For me personally it just kinda adds to the humor of it; like, the sheer ridiculousness of the Y/N fantasy coupled with the overly romanticized descriptions (the warmth of Yoongi's hand pls i'm dying) just makes it funnier, especially if you're well aware that it's just a fictional game that isn't meant to suggest anything in that sense. Also, the Y/N answers lead you to a bad relationship with the boys in-game. They're bound to be there, because again, visual novels. If you don't want them, don't choose them. The platonic/professional ones get you more points anyway.

But also, I don't think the 'it's a visual novel' aspect should excuse peoples' issues with it, or their discomfort. Feelings are valid. It's okay to feel uncomfortable with it. But please don't take it out on the boys themselves, do your part as a consumer, and email the developers.

&#x200B;

Re: the side stories. Yeah, I find these creepy. The stalker-ish feel it gives off isn't that great. I'm just here for the videos and actor Jin.

&#x200B;

Re: the boys' personalities. I've seen people take an issue with this and how they've been portrayed. While I think some of it is the translation, I want to add a bit of a more personal note to it. As someone who watched a lot of anime back in the day, the scenarios and the personalities they were given play off exactly like how it would in an anime. It's an anime VN. Just in live action. I don't think that excuses any discomfort people might feel with it, and I do hope that the brashness doesn't damage the boys' reputation in real life--but they reiterate that this is just fiction, and as far as otome/anime tropes go, this fits the bill perfectly.

&#x200B;

Personal thoughts: I think it could be better. The graphics are great, the design is great, and the music is of course top notch. Going into it, I didn't really expect much because it was....kind of obvious from the get-go that there would be some 'closeness' involved, self-insert pieces always seem to have that element to them. The translation needs work; I feel like had it been done better, we wouldn't be having this much of a fiasco in the first place. Even the weight/body image situations seemed to be handled poorly in translation, according to what I've seen (the Korean and Chinese versions didn't go into too much detail, I think; please correct me if I'm wrong). I think if Netmarble takes the valid criticism into account, it could be an even better, more enjoyable game for more people.

I also think expectations (especially on stan twt) were built way too high based on how high quality the OST is. I don't blame them, with a soundtrack like that you'd expect some deep Pixar shit or something.

And another thing: stan Twitter has an image of BTS as a band that does not or should not cater to 'typical boyband fangirl's whims.' While I do think there is a lot to BTS that goes way beyond your 'stereotypical boyband,' I also think it's a little...unrealistic? to expect that they will never dip their toes into it ever again. Take into consideration too that this game was made two years ago; a lot has changed within BTS and the fandom in that time, and as of right now, the image that stan twitter especially has been pushing for is something more along the lines of 'serious artist.' Even the tiniest bit of pandering doesn't fit that image. I'm not saying that pandering is okay, as I do think there are some serious problems with entertaining the fantasy of 'your ideal boyfriend' too much, especially in the K-Pop industry where stalker sasaeng fans are still a huge problem. But IDK, in my opinion there's still bound to be at least a little bit of it stuck in there; there's still a hint of it, somehow, somewhere.

(That said, I do believe BTS and BigHit have set some pretty good boundaries with this, especially when you take into consideration how other bands seem to go about it. There's still a very clear line between what BTS chooses to share with us and what they choose to keep to themselves, and while I do believe they get swayed by ARMY preferences from time to time, I think that they've set up a good divide that's not too jarring nor distant, but also not too close to the point where it becomes almost delusional. I think this is another issue people have with BTS World; it gets too close. Feels like the boundary is collapsing. The discussion on that, I think, is a little more complex and can't be put down to a 'yes' or a 'no.' But anyway, I digress.)

Anyway, I'm still playing it. It's ridiculous and kind of dumb, and I love that; and I think that I can handle the more sensitive parts (but if you can't, that's okay! If distancing yourself from the game will help you, do so. Sending you love). I'm having fun imagining this tired, sleep-deprived manager just trying their very best to handle seven brats who keep getting on their last nerve. So I'll keep playing it, but if you choose not to, for whatever reason, that's fine too.
