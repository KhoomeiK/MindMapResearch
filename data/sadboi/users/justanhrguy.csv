I have a super gorgeous wife and she's amazing.  We have a son together who is also awesome.  We have a good relationship.  I don't make a crapton of money but I love my job and I love the people I work with.  I drive an Audi.  I live in a 4 bedroom home with 3 bathrooms and enough money to play around with.  We vacation regularly.  I have NOTHING to complain about.  I have most peoples' dream life, and yet, I'm still not happy.  What the hell is wrong with me?"
