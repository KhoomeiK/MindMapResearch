I’ve learned to rest ... and not think in Terms of sleep. 

Rest means - warm shower, reading, little screen use,  listening to soothing sounds.


Even if I have to st quietly for 5 minutes helps energize me if I don’t get my sleep.

If you can steal a half hour during the day
Try this ... lay down, quiet space 
Hold a set of keys or a tennis ball in your hand, close to the edge of the bed.  


You May or May not fall asleep but you will rest your body - focus on your breath or not dropping the keys or whatever else you have in your hands. 

If you’re drinking lots of caffeine or having lots of sugar prior to sleeping - take note of that. 

Also there’s an app INSIGHT TIMER ... they have sounds that are soothing ... 

The goal is to focus on rest and not sleep.

Mysore Style

The Ashtanga Yoga method is built around the ‘Mysore Style’ class, so named because yoga was taught this way by Shri K. Pattabhi Jois, in Mysore, India, and continues to be taught this way in traditional Ashtanga Yoga schools around the world. In Mysore Class, the student is taught a sequence of postures through one-on-one instruction. The correct movements, breathing, and other aspects of the practice are learned gradually, in a step-by-step process accessible to anyone. This method allows each student time to practice and memorize what they have learned before adding more. Students are able to practice independently and at their own pace while surrounded by the energy and inspiration of other students in the room. The main teacher and assistants are able to work with each student individually. Initially, students may require more attention, but as they become proficient in their practice, they are allowed more independence, receiving adjustments and assistance only when required."
