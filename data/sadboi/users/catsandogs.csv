depression,eqhg9ho,t3_byfqxg,1560057966.0,"This. Lost my sister almost 2 years ago. I‚Äôm so sorry to hear you lost your brother.  Also my parents went through a messy years-long divorce when I was about your age which wasn‚Äôt that long ago. Hang in there, hold onto people that see the best in you. And fuck drugs they are temporary happiness and often times isolate you. Still battle addiction and it‚Äôs never helped in the long run. Do not isolate. For what it‚Äôs worth I care about you. I feel your pain and I love you"
depression,eqhftp1,t1_eqgqsw8,1560057573.0,Yes!!
depression,eqhfn0j,t1_eqfpwue,1560057406.0,I have really bad problems with this too. Having a small goal helps. Like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get out of bed today.‚Äù Boom ho accomplished lol. Or self care things too. Sometimes those goals don‚Äôt get accomplished that‚Äôs okay. At least you made a goal. That‚Äôs always nice.
depression,eqhfibb,t1_eqhd4ss,1560057285.0,Yess this. Depression takes time to deal with and manage.
depression,eqhfeoa,t1_eqghgav,1560057194.0,"I feel ya. I hate when people ask what my aspirations are, like my aspirations are to keep myself from wanting to die or dying somehow lol. I don‚Äôt actually say that but people close to me understand that that‚Äôs kinda where I‚Äôm at. It took a long time though (Years) to be at the acceptance level I‚Äôm at now though. I used to try so hard to fulfill people‚Äôs expectations until I realized I‚Äôm not like other people. Just going at a different pace."
depression,eps5vqa,t3_bvofhl,1559438609.0,"There are so many things to be proud of here. You are a fucking SURVIVOR. Fuck depression. You‚Äôve graduated and made it to 19. Almost 20! That‚Äôs an accomplishment in itself. Get away from these abusers and negative family members in your life. There are genuinely good people in the world. Please don‚Äôt end your life. There are things in the future you will never experience that are beautiful. 

If you are feeling suicidal, go to the emergency room or talk to the emergency room operator about how you are feeling. They will keep you safe from yourself. This is a battle that you have been on the winning side for years. Don‚Äôt give in to the depression no matter what. 

What hobbies are you into? Sometimes just watching a stupid dramatic tv show like reality tv will make me feel less depressed just because of how stupid it is."

depression,eotkg0z,t1_eoqpzor,1558842810.0,YES. Loneliness is the worst.
