Thus said, many simple surnames is started with a trait of the family. Like, if one family of merchants would have 'ค้า(trading)' in the surname, then add some words of blessing or good meanings, like 'excel(เก่ง)'. Combine them together would be like 'เก่งค้า (excel at trading)'

The longer and elaborate surnames you see a lot in middle or high class people is often given/named by royalty or monks for their ancestral deeds. Often having roots in Khmer, Bali-Sanskit or other ancient language.

Some few other example are the family of Chinese or foreign descent. Which usually starts or have part of the surname sounds like original family name, then applied like the first example.

An example of common western surname turned thai is Smith - สมิธ

With all that said, maybe you could get creative and build a legacy with the name you came up with. :)"
