I struggle with OCD and bipolar and i often feel like i’m the only one the world like this and i feel so alone. I’ve also noticed that when I find others like me though, I excuse my misery and self loathing because others are doing the same thing. I hate to say it, sometimes it’s better to feel a little alone in this! Support is lovely but relating to others about your illness can sometimes just make it easier to fall into bad habits.

My advice, stop ruining your life for somebody who’s already ruined theirs. He’s obviously been given many chances and you’ve tried to help. As a past drug addict, I’ll tell you that you won’t change unless you don’t have any other options. Stop being one of your dads options, maybe then he’ll get serious and get better.

OCD is a really broad and encompassing illness, meaning it can appear in many forms. One of the biggest things for me is I thought for the longest time i was going crazy. I was a fucking psycho because of my need for things to be a certain way or thinking my brain is microchipped for some reason. You mentioned religion being something you fear or makes you anxious. That’s actually apart of OCD as well, fear of a god or something greater than you. To the point of obsession. My thoughts used to get so bad that the only thing that stopped them was aggressive self harm. Almost broke my hand many times, used to punch my self when i was little and bruise my arms on concrete until it moved into more dangerous things. I also have developed an eating disorder because of it. But it’s all stuff that i do because if i’m in pain or discomfort, the thoughts don’t happen. Because they feel impossible to stop any other way. But these are all extremely unhealthy ways of dealing with it which I why i stress to you to tell and therapist or whoever you talk to. It can very quickly spiral out of control. Try to keep tracking your experiences and symptoms and work on identifying what makes you anxious. Being aware is the most powerful thing because otherwise it’ll eat you alive. Please be safe, and talk to somebody. OCD can ruin your life slowly in very weird ways. Consumes your entire mind. Lol i used to cry when i was little if my mom put socks on me or didn’t cut my tags off of my clothes. Also feel free to message me with any questions.

AskReddit,fio2fdm,t3_f8pr0l,1582574983.0,"This is to date the craziest thing that’s ever happened to me. Went to the hot springs near my town. No cell service since I live in a pretty mountainy area. We drove out about an hour and hiked 30 minutes in. When we get there, the main pool is so full we decide to go to the upper pool. Naked people aren’t uncommon, but best to avoid at all costs. We were informed of a naked guy above so we tried the lower pool again, but since then it had gained another group. So we went back up top. 

As soon as we get up there, i noticed a downed deer in the hot spring runoff. This is all natural hot springs and in the dead of winter so there was a runoff area you could walk around in due to the snow melt. I asked what was wrong and the people in the pool said their dog had attacked it. I noticed a guy and his girlfriend already down there “dealing” with it. The girlfriend watched while the other guy swung the deer around, almost as if it was just a rag doll. Kept making horrible distress noises, something you never really hear from a deer because it’s rare you encounter one so closely that’s unable to run from you. He continues to man handle the deer and throw it over a snowy log. I said to everyone at the pool “what is he doing? is he trying to kill it?”. Which i was then informed that everyone else thought he was calming the deer down. I’ve lived in my state my whole life, hunted deer, lived in the woods. This is now how you calm a deer down. 

After he throws the deer over the log, this man LITERALLY WWE jumped onto the deer. I immediately presumed he tried to break its back. He’s down behind the log for about five minutes and we can’t see him at all. He proceeds to get up, and just fucking walk away. On a separate trail. We’re all telling “what the fuck did you just do to that deer? did you just fucking kill that deer you piece of shit?” I had yet to undress due to the unraveling events before me. I told everyone in the pool I was going to go see what happened. 

This is where naked guy comes in. He’s already agitated, drunk, and obviously has something wrong in his head. He’s screaming about killing the guy already, bashing his fucking skull in. Just in general extremely agitated over the whole situation. I walk down there and see the deer is still breathing so it’s not dead. I look back and naked man is running towards me. Has since put in a rope but no shoes or anything. He runs in knee deep mud and snow, hops over the log (which i had not due to mud) and notices blood in the snow. He’s now on top of the deer, inspecting it like a mad man before yelling, “HE FUCKING POACHED HIS ANTLERS. WHAT THE FUCK DUDE. IM GOING TO FUCKING MURDER THAT GUY”. 

Now this is is the we need to leave now moment. Guy pulls out his already loaded, one in the chamber pistol and fires 3 round point blank to the deers face while my boyfriend and i are standing 3 feet from him. He stops firing and turns towards us screaming profanities, almost like he was about to transform into the hulk. Except he’s in a bath rope and looks like a homeless man. My boyfriend begins begging him to stop swinging the gun around. While he’s talking to us, the gun is being pointed at us, finger on the trigger, getting more and more upset. Literally screaming about fucking killing somebody. We’re too afraid to move, he walks to the other side of us so the only thing standing between safety (the trail and other people witnessing this) is him and his loaded pistol. We’re still begging him to unload and put the gun down. He finally agrees and removes the magazine and FUCKING FLIPS THE GUN UPSIDE DOWN POINTED AT ME FINGER ON THE TRIGGER.... to unload the fucking loaded one in the chamber. He sets those pieces in my hand, sets the pistols in my boyfriends hand. 

We walk, stunned back up to the pool, where everyone is already packing their stuff up. We begin to gather our things immediately. My boyfriend has PTSD from something involving guns and a friend getting shot so he’s in this panic mode. We leave his gun stuff on his jacket and high tail it out there. All the while the naked guy is continuing to get more and more agitated. Trying to explain to the group why he was angry, talking about strangling the guy with his bare hands or beating his face to a pulp. Right before we leave he screams “THIS IS SPARTA!!!!” in the middle of butt fuck nowhere. 10 feet from the upper pool i begin to just hysterically cry and have a panic attack as we’re leaving. We managed to direct every single person at the hotsprings back to their car because he was so dangerous. Told every person along the way to turn back, it’s not safe. 

We eventually got to the parking lot where the poacher was still loading up his car so we took his plates and went to the nearest place with a phone and called in both incidents. Turns out the crazy guy called himself to get the deer removed.... after he’d dragged the entire deer out two miles in the mountains and snow, back to the highway, beginning of trail, by himself. Guy who poached got charged and the forest service used my official statement to charge the guy with the gun but. That was my we need to leave now moment lol."

mentalillness,fickq2a,t1_fibpvdk,1582350356.0,"The best advice I feel like I can give you. I suffer from Bipolar 1 and OCD. Every day of my life I struggle. I am currently out of a job, 21 and no plans of moving out of my moms home anytime soon. You are absolutely the only person who can change these things in yourself. You’re fighting a battle in your head, and only you can be the winner. I ask myself every day “is my illness going to ruin my day today?” and i remind myself that it is within my ability to change. To note the things that I do that I don’t want to do anymore. Observe what makes my OCD tick, or identifying traits of my highs and lows that I wish were different. It’s not that these things are necessarily bad, they’re just things that I notice would improve my life and me as a person. I’ve asked for help, been in counseling, therapy, naturopaths. All it’s taught me is that we spend so much time searching in all the wrong places. The biggest changes you can make within yourself are in your own hands. Of course support is important, therapies, meds if that’s your vibe, but change really does have to come from within. As cheesy as that is lol.  I think you’ll also find a lot of people you don’t even realize are, but they’re also battling something. For my OCD, the best way to break the anxiety and thought pattern is to avoid those things. But the best to way battle OCD, it to face that fear. You deserve to do all of these things. Because of how long you’ve waited, and worried and thought about it. You deserve to get a license, having a car is awesome! You get to drive yourself to so many cool paces whenever! The woods, or beach, or cattle fields haha, just imagine! Windows down and your favorite songs on. Just cruising by yourself. And goddamn you deserve to go to college. Because you didn’t do 12 years of damn school to begin with for nothing! I myself have the coldest feet about college, being bipolar I can’t seem to commit to much.But i like to imagine where I would ideally like to see myself in my future. What I could, not what I am now. And I know that person deserved the courage to get there. But that person is just you, before you. Makes sense? I’m high. You were given the challenges in your life for a reason. You will be a stronger person because of it. I hope this helps. Much love. Also stay positive, objects in motion tend to stay in motion, and manifest your own reality."
Reduction,fichcmm,t1_fich80o,1582347175.0,This is good to know! I’m on a new antibiotic but shit i’ll try anything at this point. I’ll pick some of this up tomorrow. Thank you!
Reduction,fichaea,t1_fich5sj,1582347121.0,I believe that’s what i was on for an IV today. At this point i’ve lost track of the names of what does work. They said they’re using 3rd generation antibiotics in the family of penicillin. My surgeon couldn’t believe i was reacting to literally everything. I’ve grown up with ear infections and really bad strep so i’ve dealt with this issue my whole life. My body is just very sensitive!
Reduction,fich4o3,t1_fich33l,1582346983.0,I’m also allergic to that lol
Reduction,fich1sx,t1_ficgjb5,1582346914.0,Well so my issue is i’m allergic to one of the biggest antibiotics used for things like this and most are derivatives of this antibiotic so i can’t really use much. At this point we’re with hydrocortisone and some ice haha. I checked myself out of my hospital early due to poor staff.
Reduction,ficfgdt,t1_fibrp6f,1582345567.0,"That’s exactly what i’ve found in my own researching of the subject. Using an oil vape and edibles seems to be totally fine. My surgeon said all THC would affect my healing but i’ve been using edible gummies and a THC vape for about a week since post op a week and half ago and my surgeon keeps saying how well my wounds are healing so it must not affect much! Despite an allergic reaction to some antibiotics, THC has so far shown no harm in my healing."

Reduction,fibaktm,t1_fib2cvc,1582317963.0,"I’ll be sure to keep everyone updated. I was taking Bactrim for a possible infection (which we now think is just an allergic reaction from the skin glue on my incisions), and i was slathering in an anti bacterial cream and covering incisions with these weird wet webbed pieces to keep the moisture on my incisions. I’m allergic to amoxicillin and penicillin so they’re limited to what they can give for suspected infections. So now i’m having a reaction to 1 of the 3 things (or multiple things lol) that they put me on to battle the initial allergic reaction. I’m currently getting admitted and waiting on an IV with some antibiotic names I can’t remember."

Reduction,fi4zlrf,t3_f6h5bs,1582151705.0,"Having a back scratcher was extremely nice. 
Definitely self label your med bottles. Ask for a cup from the hospital to take home! It’s small enough to lift but comes with a straw so it’s easy and you’re not wasting straws. Don’t get antsy about wanting to try on things or shop. You’ll be swollen for awhile and it’s so so easy to irritate your incisions or just exhaust yourself  from one little Victoria Secret session. Drink so much water. If you have to get out of bed without someone, try sitting up and using your legs to roll onto your shins and then you can just step out of bed."

Reduction,fi2onl3,t1_fi27g9r,1582084806.0,"I completely disagree. The exact opposite of what these people want is attention. They are purely doing this for tit pics. Like seriously. It actually makes me a little mad my comment was deleted because now others will receive these messages and not know any better. I agree there needs to be a discussion but the logic of your standing just doesn’t really make any sense honestly. If you’re a creep, you want to remain anonymous and unseen. If anything not mentioning their names encourages the behavior because they know the mods won’t even allow their names to be posted. They’ll just move to the next forum without ANY repercussions. All i’m saying, they’re not in it to piss of us off or provoke a reaction. They’re doing it for pictures of our boobs. I highly doubt anyone doing this would like their name posted anywhere."
Reduction,fi272yw,t1_fi25qs4,1582072982.0,"Could you explain to me how it encourages them? I don’t see how it encourages anything but awareness and safe practice in online exchange with others. I didn’t tag them so they’re not notified. I simply let others know the names of people not to talk to. If you ask me that’s far more important. And it makes it harder for them to scam if everyone is aware of the scammers in the forum? I just don’t see what you’re saying. If somebody is already on the page to creep around, they’re already on the page to creep around. Seeing my post won’t make it any better or worse.
