I am so sorry you had to go through this!"
acne,fqtawvl,t1_fqt9pzh,1589634941.0,"Thank you for the wishes! What is your repairing skin moisture routine, if you dont mind me asking? Ive been struggling with dry skin due to using lotion with zinc in it to dry the zits, and the epiduo also dries my skin. I use a light moisturising lotion in the morning, but i dont believe it does much."
acne,fqs7qob,t3_gkd28z,1589600424.0,"Epiduo doesnt help me much. Been using since september. Still get flair ups, then it gets better then worse again. 

If your acne comes from insulin resistance or hormones, this likely wont help you."
BipolarMemes,fqo95is,t3_g93tus,1589510155.0,Nah thats crazy. Ive had friends with mental illnesses. Nothing worse than them being delusional/suicidal/depressed when you have already found your meds and you're over that stuff.
acne,fqlan8u,t1_fql2yug,1589452136.0,*lives specifically in the smaller intestines
acne,fql2yug,t1_fqk48cl,1589444438.0,"The only seemingly credible information I can find is about the fact that you can get the information about bacteria that lives specifically in the gut (no further up tho, that is truly impossible). The whole cilantro/other vegetables being best for some people based on that information seems to be a fuss made by the companies that do the testing. They are selling a service, so it makes sense. But it doesnt seem like actual science thinks that eating specific vegetables makes a difference. So I am not sure, but it honestly doesn't sound realistic. 

Maybe it is something new that not a lot of doctors and scientists know about."
bipolar,fqgmhm8,t3_gim8za,1589350348.0,How can a psychologist diagnose anyone tho? Isn't that the psychiatrist's job?
acne,fqgjzrs,t3_gicxlh,1589348316.0,I saw a gastroenterologist recently and they never mentioned anything like getting poop tested for figuring out if cilantro is useful ??? They told me that its impossible to know what bacteria lives in the intestines because it is just so long. All they told me is that any fibre is useful and helpful. I've read studies that say that fibre is good for acne treatment. But getting poop tested ????????
acne,fqgjqxn,t3_gio1tr,1589348124.0,"This looks like an issue from within, like something hormone related for example. It could be a sign that something is wrong with one of your organs/other processes in the body. I think trying to seek help from a professional and getting things like bloodwork done is essential."
mentalhealth,fpq9u18,t3_gepf5k,1588818112.0,"Ive had a similar issue with work and classes (working from home and doing online classes). For a month I was struggling even with just sitting down and starting. 

What I did was I outlined my goals, you can write them on paper. Think about your dream job or the graduation day, how proud you're going to be when you're there. Think about all these things and they should motivate you to do more work. 

Also try doing things for fun, enjoying the process. Try rewarding yourself with things like watching a TV show, going for a walk (anything that makes you feel good)."
mentalhealth,fpq9bt9,t1_fpoorft,1588817806.0,"The only person who can determine what kind of therapy you need for such a complex set of disorders is a licensed psychiatrist. Also, try seeing one in person, not online. 

In my experience, food doesn't matter as much, as in it doesn't trigger psychosis or like prevent it. Literally does nothing for me. 

As for substances (although you didn't ask, I have to mention it), try to stay away from those. Drugs, alcohol, even weed. All of those can trigger episodes, psychosis, might give you anxiety or panic attacks. All sorts of things can happen. 

And yes, sleep is very important for anyone who is struggling with mental health disorders. Try not going to bed too late and getting 9-10 hours of sleep. That actually helps!"

bipolar,fpflrqv,t3_g9lgnm,1588575232.0,"Ive been told by multiple doctors not to do it. While i was smoking I could sleep well, but I think it triggered a major manic episode for me. So now I don't smoke, i quit almost a year ago."
TheSocietyNetflix,fp8u8u8,t3_gbxc2h,1588403174.0,I think it was just drama for the sake of drama. If Grizz just accepted the fact and congratulated him it wouldnt be interesting to watch.
Tinder,fp4j3ap,t3_gb7jol,1588300158.0,"You can propose deleting the app (for both of you), but then again thats based on trust. If you delete it you wont know if he is using it while you are not. But do you need somebody you cant trust/who breaks your trust? 

Try to have an actual conversation with him about the status of your relationship, because he might be thinking that you guys are something else, like a fwb kinda thing. Set some boundaries and ""rules"", tell him how you are feeling."
