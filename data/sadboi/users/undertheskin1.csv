COents,fq5w0c6,t1_fq18inc,1589118923.0,You’re half right on that one for instance I bought the wedding cake Flower strain from the same dispensary two different times...first time it was excellent...second time it was all dried out and lost its potency but was the same price. It’s not as black an white as “u pay big money u get good pot” cause u will still get screwed like I did sometimes. Also I didn’t smell the wedding cake on the 2nd purchase since I thought... why would it be different from the week and a half ago when I bought it... but I was very wrong and the weed was ruined

Bombstrap,ffheen2,t1_fdutebp,1579931842.0,"go watch sams new instagram video... Your prob not ""likable"" enough according to his logic. Who's likeable? apparently eggman who is a waste of space.. whos not likeable? james price who stood with mde through thick and thin only to be erased and not longer talked about by sam. 

One last point.. In that instagram video with nick.. sam explains how people expect alot but they really just make shit quality stuff and arent likeable... HMMM wonder why joe rogan or pewdiepie wont do anything for sam... even though sam has begged for them to help him out with clout. Sams a huge asshole.. He doesnt care about the skill of ur work... just if ur ""likeable"" just typical cult of personality bullshit we see everywhere. just keep being a paypig and dont expect anything from sam."

Bombstrap,fffo8uh,t3_est0em,1579888210.0,"it seems that way. also its real depressing seeing sams content without the editing that made it so entertaining. James Price a loyal member of the group is no longer discussed like hes just gone.. i personally think sam isnt loyal to his friends.. before his twitter was suspended recently he was posting to give money to eggman who is not deserving of that attention. it says a lot when sam no longer mentions these people like james price or zach waltmann and then his content changes to not much editing. hydewars also has bicflame in it who i feel like just doesnt fit into the group.. he showcases his skateboarding skills which is irrelevant to anything but yet it featured in a hydewars intro.. just seems like sams direction is changing and it hurts to not have that creative influence that sam and mde used to be. 
But where would sam and mde be without politics.. its the most popular topic and the main reason they got success..
Its grueling to edit videos for hours trying to make them unique with lots of detail for them only to receive little views. You can prove this... by making a youtube account stealing other popular youtubers content and creating a highlight video.. (i made a dumb highlight video for a video game and got 2,000 views with no shilling on reddit but yet u put effort into something and it just dies online) maybe the same thing is happening for hydewars.. might be taxxing to create those videos when u can just make vlog style videos..."

before this happened with sam and charls, i considered him my least favorite but he would surprise me with some good stuff. esp the video bombstrap with sam and the little girl taped to charls chest with explosions. charls had some real cool projects he was apart of. but overtime instead of maturing he did the opposite. 
i think charls speaks to the younger audience of mde more the any member. 
so of course when charls parts ways.. he starts streaming vidya games like that dumbass game rocket league(fucking hate that game bout the most retarted shit ive seen in awhile).. and becomes what all these lazy millennial are like. live streaming in front of a camera talking or gaming... nothing like a mans hard work and dedication in a craft.. countless hourless of editing/animating. 

and the more time goes on it seems like charls may TAKE AWHILE to make content like many of us expect he would..
so the divide between sam and charls fan is good in a way, cause theres less immaturity interacting with sams fans. because its more divided now ;)
hopefully sam does well and sells the jaihoo book soon and get onto more projects.
charls fan represent the laziness of this generation in ways. so of course hes liked by people who enjoy chapo trap house... one of the popular fan art posted of charls recently was a chapo poster so i can imagine what other fans hes attracting. 

one last point like how bones can make some cool songs.. if you watch his interviews he treats people very harshly and crude... maybe half the time or less but treating people like that doesnt make u a man.. hes been angry and hostile to fans while on stage.. hes no man to me.. just some angry confused little boy. and also if you look at all the peices of trash that come into bones concerts it starts painting a better picture of what people align with this music.. and i can tell u one thing alot of them aint white and they dont look the type to trust"
