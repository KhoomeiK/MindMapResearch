In all likelihood, we are probably better off with Biden, but he's no ally, and shaming people who won't vote for him, as though it's some sort of slam dunk that we'll all be better off is preposterous."

We had a once-in-a-lifetime candidate, for many us, with a legit shot to win and they purposefully sabotaged that and silenced us. I cannot possibly help them attain power. Perhaps, the Democrats need to be roundly defeated, and maybe things need get much worse for everyone, in order for them to get better. I know this is probably an unwelcome viewpoint, and that people will make valid points about things like climate, but I have reached my breaking point and can no longer participate in this madness."
