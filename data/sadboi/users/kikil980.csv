I’m not sure how to repair just this spot without it being noticeably newer finish than the rest. I’m pretty good with DIY projects in general, but not at all skilled with this. If it wouldn’t be too difficult or risky to touch up all of the floors as the better option, I could probably do it. If that’s the only option that will work, Id appreciate any advice on the simplest and most noninvasive way to retouch all of the floors without sanding. Also any insight on the difficulty to do it for about 600 sq. feet of flooring so that I can decide if it’s worth it or not. I don’t want to be charged for all of the floors because they were worn out badly when I moved in. The property has switched owners since I moved in, so I’m afraid that the new owners may not be aware of the state of the apartment when I came. Thank you."

(ex: we just talked today about how depressed i’m becoming as of recently and his solution was to stick to a schedule daily and do things that make me happy. the thing is that barely anything makes me happy right now, but he just couldn’t understand that). None the less even his unhelpful advice is nice because at least he cares and tries. We haven’t been together too long, but the few little arguments we’ve had have stemmed for him being wrong about a fact and me being stubborn and needing to prove that I was right.

BMI was invented almost 200 years ago and while it’s still the most commonly used tool to find if somebody is a healthy weight, there’s much better ways now. It’s not an insecurity issue with being worried about being classified as overweight, it’s more an issue with it being inaccurate for many people. The inaccuracies affect both men and women as men are more likely to have more muscle which skew results and it is not unhealthy for women to hold some weight in their hips/thighs.

popping,fbhcq7x,t1_fbf0zsg,1576870572.0,yeah I think that’s what is in my nose. i just haven’t found the style of earrings that I like
popping,fbhck44,t1_fbf8b78,1576870457.0,"I tried and pushed as much as I could, but still just a little more has come out. I know there’s more in there, so Ill let it cultivate and continue to try."
popping,fbhch9i,t1_fbf8c6u,1576870404.0,"Oh yeah still today after continuing to try to push it out I feel a bump under there. It’ll all come out eventually, but you’re absolutely right."
popping,fbhcdmm,t1_fbf137q,1576870336.0,I googled it and I guess skin that just has a higher acidity pH makes gold create green marks. It’s odd
popping,fbhc3sj,t1_fbfgqyj,1576870151.0,Thank you! I love this color :)
popping,fbek93l,t1_fbee8g3,1576787553.0,"I’m fine with good jewelry. My skin is weird and makes cheap jewelry turn so easily. Even real gold rings turn my fingers green, but silver and steel don’t give me issues luckily."
popping,fbek2tp,t1_fbe3p1l,1576787441.0,"My skin is allergic to just about everything, so probably. Silver plated earrings are on my christmas list!"
popping,fbe0ha4,t1_fbdz0i8,1576775456.0,I try to record every time I see a good pop but usually it’s out of focus or disappointing. I’ll keep recording and hope for some more good ones to post!
