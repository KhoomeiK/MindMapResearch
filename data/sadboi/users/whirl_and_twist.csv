The character moves almost the same, you pick locks the same way, the exact same mini game of unlocking the terminals is there, the same ragdoll physics, the one thing they did expand on was the AI. I'd recommend downloading PANPC mod to expand on this.

Bethesda clearly wants the game to be in with the kids but fallout is mostly played by older people. The fact that you could be cartoonishly evil in this thing was a trademark and now that is gone in place of a half baked settlement system and bad writing.

I also liked fo4 until I got my hands on new Vegas.

This shit will completely destroy you if you either wish so or take the wrong dose at the wrong time in the wrong place. It can be toe to toe with ayahuasca, that's how intense this thing is. I don't recall people passing around ayahuasca cups at a club, do you? That should tell you the kind of shit this molecule will do to you. It's a very serious trip past a certain point. But before that it's very enjoyable. So keep your doses down unless you're ready to completely give in (mind you, this is NOT always a good thing. Psychedelics punish over indulgence. There is value to be found on the lower spectrum of doses and, if you do not learn something here, then you'll hit a wall with the heroic doses.)


There's something about the other psychedelics that keep things sort of funky and hilarious, LSD can be like this. But DMT and it's cousins?
