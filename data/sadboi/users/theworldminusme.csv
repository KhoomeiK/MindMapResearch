SuicideWatch,foerdnz,t3_g6qx7q,1587712166.0,"I'm so sorry that you have these images in your mind. It can't be erased and that must be horrible. I know what it's like to struggle with a variety of awful intrusive thoughts. I understand the enormous impact it can have on your mental state. 

I used to frequent a video chat site similar to chatroulette. One night, a few years ago, I witnessed a child pornography video(it didn't look live, it just looked like someone played the video for whoever came up next on the video chat.) I was in shock and before I could look for the report button, the person ""nexted"" me. I felt sick to my stomach and there was nothing I could do to report it. That image will never leave me. I wish I had never seen it, I wish I could erase it from my mind... but I can't. I still think about those particular children in that video and wonder and hope that they're in a safer situation now. That they're surrounded by good people who care for and love them. I've seen a lot of horrible things on the internet; I used to visit gore sites out of morbid curiosity but would always avoid anything involving children getting hurt or killed. It's one thing to watch a video of an adult getting seriously injured or killed in an unfortunate accident. It's another thing to watch someone brutally assault and/or murder another human being. 

You did the right thing in reporting what you found but there are people out there whose jobs are solely for finding these images/videos and investigating the sources. There are so many investigators that are tracking down these sick people through the internet right this minute. Most investigators have regular therapy visits because no one, not even professionals, are ""trained"" to emotionally grasp the severity of what predators do to children. 

I'm not saying that the memory of these images won't always haunt you but, over time, your mind will adjust to what you witnessed. You will get stronger. I promise.

Message me anytime if you want to talk."

Anxiety,fnj4ip2,t3_g22gqq,1586991812.0,"If you have no choice but to stay in the house for the phone appt. You could set up a loud fan right by the door to use as a white noise machine. I've seen therapists set up white noise machines outside of their doors in small office settings. This may help.

Or maybe even rent a movie that you know your mom really likes and cook her favorite food before you have the phone call. That way you know she'll be occupied by something else while you're on the phone.

SubChats,fnct196,t3_g0xf1x,1586846255.0,"Just curious: Why ages 16-28?

I guess I could understand 16-24 because 24-25 is around the age that the brain is fully developed and any older than 24, most people have a harder time relating to teenagers through everyday life experiences.

16-28 just seems(from my perspective) like a really random age range.

Edit: Btw, I'm 30yrs old and when I first saw the group chat's description I was half tempted to join until I saw the age ranges. I have no problem with the rule itself (Not my group, not my rules) I just was a bit surprised. Only 2yrs ago I would've been welcome in the group but somehow it makes a difference if someone is over 28? Like I said, just curious as to the reasoning for the specificity."
sex,fmiaivd,t3_fv8wc4,1586105705.0,"I also have sexual trauma and the effect it's had on my ability to masturbate and my sex life has been terrible. I just get this overwhelmingly unpleasant sensation down there that makes me want to just forget that I have a body at all. On top of having intrusive thoughts/memories. 

My ex used to get angry with me for putting off sex for months and months. It made me feel like there was something wrong with me and that I wasn't a good partner.  

I'm so sorry that you're going through this. I wish the best for you in working through your traumatic experiences."
depression,flw9cea,t1_flw91qn,1585543273.0,Thank you for sharing that with me. That's very thoughtful
SuicideWatch,fle8hsj,t3_fo5mpc,1585079571.0,"I feel you on this. Personally, I've only called the hotline maybe 4 times in my life. The first time was useless and I felt like I was talking to someone in customer service; like I was on the phone with my insurance company or something. The 2nd time was the same. 

The other 2 times were actually helpful somewhat. The last time I called was last year and I spoke to the guy for almost an hour. In the beginning I was mid panic attack and in tears but by the end of the call I had calmed down and felt some weight had lifted off my shoulders. One thing that I've learned over the years of talking to doctors, therapists, etc. is what to say and what not to say to avoid getting admitted to the hospital. 

Obviously, not everyone will react rationally but usually with hotlines and medical proffessionals they ask very specific questions such as: ""Are thinking of harming yourself and do you have a plan?"" I'm always careful to be very clear with my wording but sometimes I also need to get off my chest that I am actually feeling suicidal(instead of hiding it like usual). So I will say something like ""I don't want to live but I don't want to die and I don't have any plans to actively hurt myself."" Which isn't necessarily always true for me(personally) and then I'll make sure to add ""I'm not a danger to myself"". This way I can still vent about not wanting to live but unless I myself decide that I need to be admitted, I'm less likely to get admitted involuntarily. 

Although, as I said and as you already know, people can react in different ways to someone disclosing that they're suicidal and it can still happen. At the end of the conversation the last time I spoke to the one person, they said that because they were concerned for my safety that they would do a follow up call the next day and would call me at a specific time. They said if I didn't answer the phone then they would have to send emergency services to do a welfare check. This made me really nervous but I agreed to the follow up call and everything went smoothly because I answered the call and again confirmed that I wasn't a danger to myself.

Hotlines really are a hit or miss when it comes to finding someone who will genuinely listen and offer supportive feedback. I'm so sorry that you're struggling with this all alone. I really do wish the best for you in finding the support you need."

NonBinary,flcyjfu,t1_flardxf,1585051385.0,"Thank you so much for your thoughtful and empathetic reply. It's a struggle not to blame myself for being compliant in a toxic relationship. I'm sorry to hear about your trauma, that's such an awful experience to go through.

SuicideWatch,fl36ipo,t3_flzl6b,1584770560.0,"I'm 30yrs old now and have been suicidal since I was 10yrs old. It's still hard to believe that I lived past 18, I was so sure I would've completed suicide by then. The last time I attempted suicide was only a few weeks ago and I'm still sure that suicide will be my eventual cause of death. It's extremely difficult for me to make plans for the future or look forward to anything. I can't even remember what it felt like to not want to die. It's rough feeling this way for so long.

 I'm so sorry that you're struggling with this too."

Anxiety,fit6c0z,t3_f9n852,1582706453.0,"Yes. It has been a huge issue for me on and off throughout most of my life; it started around the same age for me(around 10yrs old) and got really bad in high school. It wasn't so much that I was afraid of someone hearing embarrassing thoughts though. I have bad intrusive thoughts stemming mostly from OCD (at the time I didn't know much about those terms though). For anyone who doesn't know about the subject: intrusive thoughts from OCD can often be about very specific things that you personally find extremely disturbing or in some cases very taboo. The obsessions change over time. 

The first obsessive thoughts(when I was 10) were that ""god"" could hear me and that he was keeping tally of every bad thing I've thought, said and done. If I didn't make myself pray every single night, I would incessantly worry that I would go to hell and that something bad would happen to the people I cared about(as I got older I realized that christianity wasn't for me and that it was just feeding into my OCD). 

And then as teenager the thoughts evolved from childhood sexual abuse trauma and the more I would obsess over not thinking about them the worse and more frequent the thoughts would get. The abuse had stopped but I still lived with my abuser at the time so this made it extremely difficult to just try to live my life. I also started having random sexual thoughts(like imagining someone naked when I really didn't want to, etc). These thoughts just made me isolate myself more because I was so scared of people knowing what I was thinking about. 

I'm 30yrs old now and I still struggle with the intrusive thoughts about abuse and I still develop random obsessions but I'm learning how to cope better with the paranoia now. Thank you for posting this, It's always a relief when to see a post like this that makes me feel less alone."

depression,fimev6u,t1_fim2ksb,1582527496.0,"This is a good point to bring up. Apathy can definitely be a symptom of depression. I've been thinking about this lately. About how when people wander in and out of my life, that I just don't feel much of anything anymore. If anything, I feel relief because maintaining friendships is exhausting. I often feel like I'm just sort of observing ""friendships"" rather than being a friend. When someone decides that they're bored of me, I don't get upset as I used to when I was younger. Sorry to just jump in... I worry that I make things too much about myself.... but sometimes telling others how I can relate is the only way I know how to be supportive."
depression,fime1hw,t3_f8egtz,1582526603.0,"I feel this too. I've always just been in the background, the back-up friend, the follower, the tag-along. The same goes for the relationships I've been in. People ""like"" me because I'm not an asshole but I often feel like there's nothing about me to actually have a connection too. There's a difference between not being something and actually having redeeming qualities. Yes, I'm a good listener, I will keep your secrets and I don't gossip, I will never put you down for getting nerdily excited about something, I won't judge you for your average mistakes, I will have a conversation with you instead of yell at you when I'm angry, etc.... These qualities are nice but they're just aspects of basic human decency. I'm being ""liked"" for things that everyone should already be doing anyways. I write a lot but I haven't written any books, I love to sketch but I haven't finished a drawing in years, I love to play guitar but I don't know how to play any songs, I love to sing but I'm terrified of singing front of others, I took and passed a few college courses but I can't keep a job so I have nothing to show for it, I've been on disability for my mental health for 10yrs.... I just can't ever imagine why someone would want to date me or be my friend besides the fact that I make them feel good about themselves. I'm just an average loser with nothing to show for my life. I can relate to being on the neutral side of friendship... just being there but not ever being a memorable enough presence for someone to even say ""Hey, I wonder what so&so is up to?"""
SuicideWatch,fijmj9n,t3_f82md1,1582455038.0,"I can relate in my own way. Whenever anything makes me smile or laugh, I immediately, involuntarily sigh heavily right after doing so. It's not that I'm envious of the good things going on around me, it's that smiling and laughing wears me out. Everything makes me emotionally exhausted. Feeling good is just a reminder that I will go right back to feeling bad and that cycle is my life. This cycle just makes me reflect on how badly I just want to give in and die by suicide. Crying, yelling, self-harming, intrusive thoughts, involuntary tics, smiling, laughing: All of these things make me want to go to sleep and never wake up again."
SuicideWatch,fic40gh,t3_f7cais,1582337079.0,"I'm not sure what I missed but the last I checked my post was to answer someone's question that said something along the lines of ""is  it possible to make yourself useful"". I replied that it was not possible and now their question is deleted and has 12 downvotes. I'm not even sure  what they replied or if they replied. But I'm aware of how the internet works. I'm already suicidal, so I usually don't let someone being less than kind on the internet phase me. Especially when I'm putting my personal problems out there for strangers to comment on them. I don't have people in my personal life that I can be honest with about these kind of things to. That's why I vent my negative thoughts in places like this and save the positivity for the people in my personal life. As I'm sure most of the people on this subreddit can relate, just because I share the negative side of my life here doesn't mean that I don't utilize positive coping skills as well. I appreciate the supportive comments. Thank you."

selfharm,ffoitj5,t3_euc9dn,1580078087.0,"It might have something to do with psychological addiction. When you try to break a habit(self-harm), your body reacts. Also, like other commenters are saying, it can be anxiety related. A lot of people use cutting as a temporary anti-anxiety, so take away that fix and it's possible you could have mild withdrawals if you aren't accustomed to implementing other healthier coping skills in place of cutting.

This is just me talking out my ass though."
