I kinda feel bad leaving my current job after they gave me paid leave for a post-vacation quarantine I had to do last month, but it's also a Loblaws owned store so I don't feel *too* bad

As for college, my experience over the past five years has been so massively disappointing that I can't see higher education (as it exists) as much more than a massive scam that we are all obligated to participate in for a slightly greater chance to avoid poverty and I constantly dream of the day that we collectively agree that maybe we don't need an expensive piece of paper to prove your skill in *pretty much everything*"

gatesopencomeonin,fnw054u,t1_fnvtzaf,1587308692.0,"When you say the different difficulty fundamentally changed the game to the point that two people can't even talk about it if they played on different difficulties, it kinda comes off like the person who played the harder one played the ""real"" one, the game that is actually worth talking about, and the other person just played a watered down milquetoast baby game which is not even worth your time to discuss. Someone else pointed out how you can quite easily talk at length about a game with someone who played it on a different difficulty, and most of us just don't see why that would be such a huge barrier for discussing the game beyond literally just how hard you found it.

Not saying this was your intention, but your comment just has an air of hard-mode superiority."

Beyond that, it's obviously not the ideal time for a career shift

I'm also kind of trying to self-record an album, but my lack of time, knowledge, and equipment makes it an arduous process, which makes me really wish I was laid off or otherwise getting paid to do whatever I want."

Edit: I should specify $15 CAD is approx  $11 USD"

Trust me, I want this to happen so bad.

But I don't think I'm capable of starting it. Which is why I think it's best to just try and get people to consider being a more active part of the union when our collective agreement expires at the end of this month. We do have leverage, but it's probably best to get the help of the union in exercising it."
