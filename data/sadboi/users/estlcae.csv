BPD,fq8jkzm,t3_ghdwdt,1589167702.0,"This applies to me as well. In fact, every few months, I randomly get a feeling of such emptiness and dissociation that the entire context of why I am at a place appears to fall away. I then feel confused and scared, and I have to remind myself why I'm there. 

The idea of being born a human, in this specific body, on this planet, in this country, etc. creeps me out. It's downright bizarre, and I have spent many hours thinking of it. 

I used to be directionless, but I read some self-help literature, and despite how even the few good books in that category were largely useless to me, I did learn of future planning. It's quite ironic, for even though I have specific ideas for exactly what I wish to do in the future over the next few decades, I still tend to feel such hopelessness."
