depression,f8avtge,t3_dzrccf,1574414616.0,"I know how you feel. I used to feel like that a lot. No matter how much love my loved ones gave me, it was never enough. I eventually lost my relationship, apartment, education and friends. I was at my lowest point. My family ended up taking care of me and my well being. I felt like, I had nothing to live for. I still feel that sometimes. But I came to realize, if no one, truly, could give me the love I needed and deserved.. How about myself? I had zero love for myself. I just didn't care. Why should I, if no one else did? It just so happens, that you can't count on people's love and affection. How can you give love to them, if you can't even love yourself? The most important person in your universe is YOU. Stop doing things for others and expect them to give it back. I assure you, you will be left disappointed. Do it for yourself. You are a person too. Not a waste of space. You have needs like everyone else. This is about you. You DESERVE to be happy and loved - and you better get started. Start doing the things, that used to make you happy, in small amounts. Watch a movie, play for a while, paint, whatever it takes. Exercise, if only a little. Be with your family or friends for half an hour. I promise you, it will be so tough. You will be exhausted, burned out, downright wasted. But don't give up without a fight. I promised myself, that if I had to go, it would be with a fight. I deserve that. On my grave, it better say: ""never gave up"". You deserve everything good in this world, but don't count on people to give it to you."

I tend not to give her money. I mainly by the things she needs, usually cigarettes, food etc.

I know she loves me and she tries her best. The other night we both had a few drinks and it was the first time in a while we had a great time. They are just so few and far between. 

Thank you for your help!"
