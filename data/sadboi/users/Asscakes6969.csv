Personally, I'd rather have MY state run this (it's one of the responsible ones not fucking reopening early) than the federal government, but then again, that's how Canada's system works.

Our system is an unforgivable clusterfuck that kills people due to a lack of access to care. Those with nice private insurance plans that want to keep them to the detriment of those who are dangerously underinsured or UNinsured are lowering the lifeboat and rowing away while other Americans drown. Which is par for the course- hospital, insurance and pharmaceutical execs need to buy bigger yachts after all.

The only thing I like about my country versus literally any other developed country in the west without a dictator (looking at you, suddenly autocratic eastern European dictatorships) is the castle doctrine. Because fuck calling the police."
