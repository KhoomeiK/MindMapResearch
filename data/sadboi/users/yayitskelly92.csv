During those weeks I also think about ""what if I just drive off this bridge?"" Or ""what if i pull out into this intersection and get hit by a car going 50+?"" Though I never act on these impulses, the thoughts are still there. I think all of us have these thoughts at some point in our lives and it's a defining moment for us if we act on it. I'm proud of you for thinking but not acting on those impulses because that means there is still plenty of awesome in your life to live for and that's amazing and beautiful. You're year has been though but you're still here and powering through the difficult times and that is truly awe inspiring. We (me included) are here for you."

Then the next you might have an infinitely small trigger that has you spiraling down to your valley. It makes it hard to keep on going on and to have others understand when they dont experience it for themselves.
