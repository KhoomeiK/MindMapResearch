AmItheAsshole,foxa152,t3_g9rh7j,1588137920.0,"YTA. I don‚Äôt agree with the people who are being super harsh about it saying you should break up and whatever. As a girl who struggles with her self image and who also has a hard time finding clothes that fit because I‚Äôm petite, your girlfriend is likely wearing what makes her feel the most comfortable both physically and mentally. It‚Äôs her body and you don‚Äôt really have a right to ask her to dress a certain way. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre coming from a bad place and I understand your position but at the end of the day she deserves to wear what makes her feel the most confident and comfortable even if it‚Äôs not your idea of what ‚Äúlooks best‚Äù"
