SSRIs,ezmf5cy,t3_d1hxzy,1567991037.0,"See a psychiatrist. Everyone has different experiences on medications for anti-anxiety and anti-depression so sometimes it takes a while to fine the right ones. 

I was taking sertraline (Zoloft) and it helped but I gained some weight. It was a rough two weeks when I started it (stomach issues and felt kind of hazy) but that went away.  

Now I take viibryd. No issues yet but I just started. 

I was nervous to start with the medications too but it has been life changing and I feel like “me” again."
depressionregimens,eyz6w2i,t3_ci7s6n,1567610947.0,I just started taking viibryd. Doc has me taking 10mg. Small GI side effects but I do have a dull headache. Anyone else experience this and did it go away?
fitmeals,eysk3hm,t3_cyg54z,1567401075.0,Sometimes it’s difficult to estimate the calories. Go for bakes or broiled chicken or fish items without sauces. Ask for dressings on the side so you can control the amount. And ask for a box first so that you can put away half before you overeat.
depression,eydeogw,t1_eydagis,1567017305.0,"If the meds made you feel worse then you weren’t on the right meds for you. 

They all affect people differently. I felt the same way. Like driving at night and hoping a drunk driver hit me. I started taking Zoloft and while it made me a zombie at first, after a month I no longer had these thoughts. Suicidal thoughts just didn’t occur to me while driving anymore. Unfortunately I gained some weight and decided to try viibryd which I am on now but so far so good. 


All I’m saying is that it’s best to stay in contact with your MD (a psychiatrist, not a primary care md) and tell them about how you feel and side effects of different meds. It can take a while to find the right one."
