BPD,fkfy3mh,t1_fkei5kv,1584145287.0,"Do yourself a favor and quit now. The first few days suck and you'll have nothing but thoughts about how you can't do it, but once you get a week in you'll feel amazing. The reason it's so hard to quit isn't because you can't do it, it's because it sucks away your motivation to do anything, including quitting. A few days of sleeping like shit and feeling dead are nothing compared to the satisfaction of having a clear head, trust me! Don't try and justify to yourself that you can do it every now and then, just bite the bullet and take a week off then reevaluate once you make it through."
SandersForPresident,fii7k3g,t3_f8003s,1582418251.0,I'm just as much for Bernie as anyone else here but do you really need to lie in the title like that? If only 2% of precincts were reporting when this was posted you can't just say that he's won. Bernie is the poster child for honesty in this country and having his supporters make up facts is not where we want to be. That being said he's on a good track to win and I wish him the best of luck!

Hijacking this because a lot of people are complaining that weed addiction isn't a thing:

There's a community of literally over 100,000 people that have trouble quitting weed (r/leaves), and who knows how many people who haven't confronted the fact that they have a problem with it yet. Sure it's not a ""hard drug"" in that you won't die from it, but it's a dopaminergic substance that lets you escape from reality. It's addictive. Why do you think the word stoner exists. The withdrawal symptoms are real and can range from not too bad to absolute hell. Not being able to sleep for a week or more isn't exactly an easy hurdle to jump through. You all can get off your high horses about being addicted to harder drugs and accept that everyone's minds are different and people can have problems with different things. Hell, people get addicted to cigarettes which are only a fraction as psychoactive as weed."

Petioles,fftmijo,t3_ev0cmn,1580224324.0,For me whenever I build up a sativa tolerance my highs get dark after a few days. I've found that it's best to use once in a while with minimal tolerance to get all of the good uplifting/energetic feelings.

It's really easy to convince yourself that you can quit whenever you want and then just smoke away a couple months like it's nothing.
leaves,fcvpefn,t3_ej52pa,1578007109.0,"The first two or so days are the worst by far, just try and keep yourself busy. Exercise is the best thing you can do because it interacts with your endocannabinoid system and gives you a little bit of relief from the withdrawal symptoms. The most important thing you can do is not go back to it right away after you feel like you've kicked it, it's super easy to keep justifying it until you're back in the same place you started."
Drugs,fc9j4q9,t1_fc9fzx1,1577553421.0,"In that case maybe try only smoking when you're not around going to be around people. The only time I get the anxiety that I used to have anymore is when I get high with friends. Another thing that helped me was building up my confidence. I started exercising, caring about how I looked, I forced myself to go on dates, etc. All of that helps you get a little more comfortable in your own skin, and before you know it you won't be stressing about insignificant things anymore. Just hang in there, anxiety sucks. I've been through pretty much everything you've described but I can promise you that it gets better, and if you keep working on yourself those feelings will eventually go away. I know some people that take benzos/other stuff for anxiety. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but I'd really recommend putting in the effort to get over it yourself rather than locking yourself into some drug like that at such a young age."
Drugs,fc9e13j,t3_egldu6,1577551234.0,"After a few months of being a stoner my lifelong anxiety went away almost completely. It helped me see how little a lot of the things that my anxiety told me were a big deal actually matter in the long run. Aside from that I'd recommend  rather than trying to stuff those feelings down with drugs, try focusing on getting more life experiences and pushing your boundaries socially. It sounds stupid but really that's the best thing you can do to get over it. Something I heard once that helped me a lot is that you judge yourself a LOT more than other people judge you.  99.99% of people don't give a fuck what you do, all the pressure you put on yourself is pointless."
