I have read a lot of different child abuse cases involving polygamists and it seems like they are hardly ever removed from the parents.  Daniel Kingston even spent time in jail for almost killing one of his daughters for not wanti g to stay married to her uncle.  This was before the Jessica and Andrea escaped. I have heard some of the judges favor families together no matter how horrible for the children.  The Kingston klan is very interesting.   There used to be a lot of info online about how horrible they are, but they have gotten most of it removed."
