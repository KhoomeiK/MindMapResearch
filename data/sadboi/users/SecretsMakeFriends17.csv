adultsurvivors,ewmvv5k,t1_es4ophu,1565561826.0,"I was threatened with the death of my mother as well and she was my only parent. I reported her making me take my clothes off in the front yard and go under my porch. She was waiting in her screen door with the phone already to her head. She lived across the street and us in a quadruplex. We lived in a back apartment, so I was under someone else's porch naked. For weeks she asked ne to do this when i left her house and every night I didn't she treated me like shit the next day. Forced me to sit in my own piss and eat foods I hated, cold out of a can. 
But the second they took my mom out of the room i shut down and wouldn't talk about what she really did to me cus she convinced me the whole world would know I was dirty. I blocked this our for 5 years until it started coming back to me in nightmares. I didn't realize it was real and I started doing things like cutting to deal with it. My mom didn't notice until a girl caught me doing it at school and they sent me to counseling. I'm not even sure I ever talked about the sexual abuse while I was there."

She didn't touch me but she used me like an interactive sex toy. It still disgusts me. She had kids and babysat a whole clan of kids, that's how I ended up there in the first place. She had a husband or long term boyfriend.... I'll never understand why she targeted me"
