It's all a lie. Nothing is enjoyable. I can't even cry and feel emotion when i do. It just feels shallow.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fjx030m,t3_fex4q9,1583650899.0,"The idea that smoking while pregnant is ok is purely rubbish. Just think about this. Your blood stacks 4 molecules of oxygen and it travels it around your body for the cells. The embryo does not breath so his only source of air is through the arteries from her mother (two arteries that go through his umbilical cord). The hemoglobin that stacks that oxygen has a higher affinity for carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. If the mother smokes a part of hemoglobin switches the oxygen for the CO2 or CO from the smoke of the cigarette. So the fetus has a lower supply of oxygen that can lead to a high number of development issues.

So there is a huge problem with smoking. Is not about it has nicotine, but the cigarette is burning. Whatever burns gives out CO2 and CO(low concentrations) which is toxic for a human. We need oxygen not Co2."

I understand your GF for being mad. Your GF maybe shouldn't have pulled that scheme but you were an asshole for calling her out on it in front of your friends. You gave your GF (and us) the impression you favor Emily.

depression,fd0t14v,t3_ejnao7,1578123360.0,"It's nice how reddit works anonymously. 
I vented to people and it fired back. Now i am determined to stop that and close it in(slowly isolated myself from them) . 
It takes a hell of work and suffering and is taking a toll on me.
 I vented a few times on reddit (mostly asking for advice) but i feel i only burdened the people that answered bc they were genuinely trying to help and as much as i tried following their advice i relapsed. So yeah... 
People or  care too much or too little for you to vent to them. The ones that care too much will be affected by your state and you're the cause of their suffering and the ones that care too little will use it against you. The reddit ones i just feel bad for wasting a strangers time as i do for the other two classes. So yeah... It's relatable and shitty."
emotionalneglect,fcx43lr,t1_fcju2s0,1578050362.0,"Greetings.
Well I am sad to dissapoint you but this is not a ""i am better upadate"". You wasted precious time to give me advice and hep me but i still failed. I am sorry.  
One day I said that the only enjoyable thing of my day was sleeping, because when I wake up I have things to do for which i have no motivation to do. After this my BF spoke with his mother and she spoke to me. She showed concern I did not really understand why. Then she said that she usually sees me with a neutral face(i used to smile more), always stressed, dissapointed of what i achieved, she noticed that in the entire semester i did not enjoy any aquaintance i made( i really on't enjoy the company of my aquantancies, i find myself near them because of circumstances), my relationship with my mom is entirely gone. So, yeah, she thought it was all in my head, but now she wants me to see a therapist. I understand she only wants what is best for me, but lately i had some mixed feelings about that too. She seemed annoyed of my current state bc is affecting her son, but then said she only wants what is best for me. Now I have uncertainty wrote all over this.
By day i am lonelier and with less motivation. 
My relationship with my mother is gone. Insight: she works 2 weeks of the month in another country and i am gone to college 5/7 days so we didn't see each other often. I haven't spoken to her when she is gone. that has been going on  for months. At home we only greet each other. On Christmas she left to spend it with her BF (another story) so i was left with my BF and brother-who spent 2 h with me on xmas only because he felt compeled to. No one in the family called or messaged me on xmas or NYE. I saw my mother does not wish to speak to me because she would rather not say anything to me than to step on her pride. When i am home she doesn;t come into my room at all. She leaves my laundry at the doorstep. I bought her a flower on xmas (she bought me a gift too) but when i got home to give it to her she was gone.
I read Clarissa's e-mails (CEN specialist) but i feel no different. I tried to meditate, i tried lucid dreaming techniques, i tried keeping a journal but each day is the same dull sentence ""i hate that i woke up today"" or ""i have to study and i hate it"", i tried to schedule my time but i failed to do what i intende for that day/week so that was a harsh one. I feel doomed to fail and seem to only waste people time and energy. I feel horrible that i concern people about this. Everything seems to come and go, all volatile, all without meaning, except feeling lost, without purpose that is only getting bigger...this nuissance. 
I was so engulfed in this that i neglected studying and now i just see myslef fail (i used to be a straight A student now is average).
I am sorry for wasting your time..."
depression,fc6fodb,t3_cml6ni,1577479469.0,"Today my mother arrived home from her BF's town(6h drive by car). She spent Christmas there. I spent it with my brother, BF and BF's family. Father is in another continent. Mother's BF tried to rape me last year. He is not allowed near me anymore. So she goes to him. This is the 4th Christmas she doesn't spend with us. She is together with him for 4 years. She alienated from me and my brother. She got close to him and the relatives that support their relationship. We are her children and she says she cares about us, but she chose him. She sees my brother is dealing with some issues and isolates from us, but she chooses to make herself the victim than try to help him. Lately me and my brother had a better relationship. I feel like I lost her, but I gained him. I have little feelings for her now and i don't know how to feel about that bc she had a rough life. I feel sorry for her, for what she endured,but at the same time it angers me to think how quickly she dismissed us over a nobody.
There is only me and my brother now, I suppose. Sometimes only me."
depression,fc61iaa,t3_e2gnrw,1577470152.0,"I told my boyfriend that I don't understand what is going on. The only thing I am excited about is sleeping and am dreading the moment i see the sun rising and realize is morning. Now he tells me things as 'don't do anything stupid' or 'i love you, keep that in mind' if he is not around. Now I understand why. Oh well..."
emotionalneglect,f8kbkh5,t1_f8hvya8,1574609532.0,"Thank you very much. I do have positive conversations with people but my mind is so  clouded with the negative ones that the two might not be in balance. For a while now I've been trying to speak of a larger spectrum of subjects and with a much positive connotation . I can't let this lead my life because this kind of life is terribly lonely. 
I will do my best to recover from this state and those questions might as well help me discover the root of the problem and then come up with a plan to actually change something. Thank you once again. This really gave me hope.  and I really appreciate that you took the time to land me a hand even though you are busy travelling :) have a safe journey :)"

 This week was a really challenging one and I admit I found myself on the verge of giving up. I will take your suggestions into account an read about CEN from the links you so kindly provided me with. Thank you :)"
emotionalneglect,f85slaq,t1_f84qvnz,1574282168.0,"   Therapy seems so perfect yet so not realistic.Don't get me wrong, I approve of therapy. I say this because in my country  it is seen as something horrible and I was taught to be ashamed of wanting to go there (like teaching girls to abstain from intercourse because they can get pregnant and everyone would shame them, but no one's teaching them about contraceptives...on the lines of that..\*sorry for the weird comparison but this is the most accurate I can get\*. If you went to a therapist  people would avoid you like plague and consider you a clinically mad person. The mental assistance in my country is broken. They go with ""there is no something such as emotional neglect that is all in your mind""  
   But if you have other circumstances, I encourage you to go. The therapist might help you sort out your feelings and put them into words. Maybe you can change that normal and make one of your own, one you feel content with.  Good luck :)"
emotionalneglect,f85q9ax,t1_f825426,1574280699.0,"I apologize for the lack of detail. I will try to mend that. By ""emotional state"" I meant sadness, stress and constant pessimism, by ""feelings"" I wanted to say the feelings of anxiety that I think might annoy them, by ""thoughts"" i intended to say negative thoughts that I sometimes say outloud and I regard their expressions and comments as if they are annoyed by them. Sometimes, I feel as if I am the most annoying person in the room talking about how anxious I feel about an exam, for example, and I don't want to be a crybaby.   
By help I did not mean medical help, did not try that yet, but I am considering it. It is very difficult to do it though, because I feel ashamed about my emotional ""condition"" even though I know the sole purpose of a therapist is to help, something I need. At some point, I tried to reach for help and went to my mother with this issues. It didn't go that well, I ended up thinking it was futile.On the other hand, I receive encouragement from my BF and his mother (wonderful people), but I feel like I'm hurting them because, even though they say thoughtful things and truly try to help in any manner they see fit, it doesn't do much for me and I fall right back where I was to begin with because I keep questioning if what they say about me is a fact or is just what they want to see. I don't even bother myself asking for help from my relatives because when I did it the situation turned against me. The only close people I have left is my BF and his mother, my realtives sitanced themselves from me a while back due to a disturbing event and I had a fall out with the relatives I thought I was close to.  
I tried to ask for help by telling them(BF and BF's mother) my hardships, what I've been feeling, asking for advice but in the end I grew tired of constantly asking and explaining  so I just stopped doing it. Now they only see that I don't look as happy as I did and try to find out why but I feel that if I tell them the cycle will start again but I will end up even more frustrated.  
I am sorry if my answer was longwinded. I hope I filled the gaps from my story. Thank you for the empathy and advice :)"
