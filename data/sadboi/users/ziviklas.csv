mentalhealth,fmvmc9y,t3_fxdeyd,1586422268.0,That's really interesting. I have don't something similar in a way...I started wearing only my gym clothes and that saved me time and the stress of choosing outfits and I also had to get used to not having that identity I had built for myself by paying a lot of attention to fashion. I felt very exposed. Made me really think about where I place my self worth
mentalhealth,fmvm44j,t3_fx2qdr,1586422019.0,Being holed up inside has been really challenging because I'm stuck with my thoughts. On the other hand its forcing me to confront issues instead of just distracting myself from them
mentalhealth,fmvlz1c,t3_fplncz,1586421867.0,Yes! This is a constant anxiety for me. I always compare myself to others

ptsd,fl2sfhh,t3_flxvqd,1584758713.0,Absolutely. I think this might be a secondary contributor to my PTSD too
tattoo,fklhdku,t1_fkjvjdm,1584306333.0,Thanks! That's so true

tattoo,fk8to1j,t1_fk8skte,1583962706.0,Thanks!
ptsd,fk8rmga,t3_fgugio,1583961592.0,"Just as everyone else has said, you best friend is so very wrong. Doesn't sound like she has ever experienced trauma. I agree with the other comments about distancing yourself from this friend. You can be honest with her and say that you don't feel supported and that for your own wellbeing you need some space. How she responds to that would probably be a good indicator as to whether you should break off from the friendship completely.

If you feel like you need to get things off your chest I'm always open to talk. I live a busy life so don't generally reply right away but seriously, if you find yourself with no one to talk to I'm here."
tattoo,fk8p88o,t1_fk8m4iy,1583960286.0,"I'm not accruing 100k in student debt to go and earn (maximum) $20 an hour in a cafe or bar lol. Good point about pushing back against the rigidity/elitism of academia, though!"
tattoo,fk8hujd,t1_fk8gt54,1583956320.0,"I mentioned that the profession I work in does not take kindly to tattoos, I assumed that would be enough info. To clarify, I am getting a PhD in a science field and this particular field is incredibly competitive, doesnt welcome people who aren't mainstream looking, and women seem to be filtered out of hiring processes pretty quickly. That's why I am thinking that, while I cant change my gender, I could make life easier by removing my tattoos."
tattoo,fk8hes6,t1_fk8fwyg,1583956081.0,"Yep, I was told that! Did I listen? Noooo. But the thing is, my hand tattoos are my favorite. They just get the most stares and I dont know if I want to continue covering them with makeup during interviews and until the hiring process is completed."
ptsd,fk6uw5i,t3_fgtkn7,1583917221.0,I'm interested in helping. Do you have any specific criteria for interviewees?
ptsd,fk5qrg8,t1_fk582za,1583886046.0,"Thanks you, I appreciate that. Sorry that you have also struggled with this, but I am relieved to know that I am not the only one. It's really hard to see my life without everything being clouded by doubt and insecurity and I am trying to find ways to fix that. 
Side note: Your english is great, I would have guessed that you are a native speaker."
