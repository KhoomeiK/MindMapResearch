shadowpeople,fnn7wvv,t1_fn6gnnm,1587086359.0,Aquarius here.  Can you tell me why you might ask?  I'm always more than up for new knowledge :)
shadowpeople,fnn7gb4,t1_fm4gao9,1587086068.0,"I'm so sorry to hear about your fiance, man.  And I completely understand a lot of your experiences; I've been dealing with 4 extremely persistent, and honestly very hostile, shadow beings for almost a decade now.  In my experience, though, they very much communicate with me telepathically.  Honestly to the point where I'm not even sure if they do communicate with me any other way.  When this first began, I was forced to go through a few different stays in psych wards and received 3 opinions: one thought I was possibly schizo-affective; the other two both told me that they saw nothing like that in me.  My MRI came back normal as well, thankfully.  I'm pretty certain (almost positive) that these beings are connected to a couple of old ex-friends of mine that both practiced witchcraft.  One was (unknowingly to me, because bI just couldn't believe that he'd ever have any reason to be) consumed with jealousy, of all things.  The second one wanted revenge, over something that I sincerely apologised for over a year to them for.  I practically begged him for forgiveness so many times.  He ended up convincing everyone else I thought was my friend into joining him an extremely painful and terrifying gangstalking campaign against me, with the goal of driving me to suicide (this has been confirmed by a few different people), and during the worst of it continued to call me and invite me over to hang out...so that he could continue abusing me, and I allowed it because of my guilt.  They are without any doubt drawn to negative emotions, and most of the time are constantly doing all they can to have me experience more of them.  They very much feed off of them, no doubt.  I'm still working on some way to rid myself of them; there has to be a way.  I won't stop until I've tried anything and everything that might even just possibly work."
schizophrenia,fnhkioy,t3_fe1qwu,1586964090.0,"My schizo-affective stuff started about 9 years ago, and around 3-4 months after someone that I considered family and my closest friend conned me into helping him with some pagan ritual.  For years, I knew he'd been dealing with hearing things and, from the looks of it, being tormented by something we couldn't see or hear.  But every other friend he had left him years before, and I guess I felt like it was my duty as a friend to try my best to be there for him and try to understand what he dealt with.

I was completely agnostic at this point in my life, and honestly only participated because he asked me to and if I wanted to ""see what he sees and hears what he hears"".  I didn't at all believe anything could or would happen.  At the end of this thing, something actually did happen.  But not enough for me to not forget about it.  A few months later, something happened with another friend of ours.  I betrayed this friend in a way that, to this day, is the absolute lowest moment of my life and something that I'll always completely regret doing (I'll just say he was married, I was single and lonelier than I'd ever been as well as very, very down on myself; I'll let you figure out the rest).  After two weeks of living with this all consuming guilt, I went to him and told him face to face what had happened.  I told him I'd take whatever ass-beating he gave me, but to please let me pull over first (we were on the highway at the moment I told him).  He never once hit me, and told me that he forgave me.  I kept apologising though; I knew he really hadn't forgiven me.  That night, I prayed harder than I ever have in my life.  I asked God to help me; I couldn't handle my guilt over this and over my failures and screw ups in my life anymore.  After praying, I felt a ""thought"" go through my mind saying ""do you want help?""  Mentally, I screamed out ""YES!!!"".  And fell asleep.

The next morning is when the voices began.  I heard someone say ""Alright Lee, let's get this started"".  And then the torture (physical, mental, and emotional), harassment, and extreme terror began.  A few weeks into this, one of the 4 voices I kept hearing said ""If he looks at the right place on the internet, he'll find out what this really is"".  So I went searching for answers, and found out about targeted individuals and gangstalking.  For many years, I believed I was being slowly killed by the government, and that everyone (even my parents and sisters) were ""in on it"".  This friend I'd hurt found out that I thought no was a targeted individual, and somehow convinced almost every single friend I thought I had to start actually gangstalking me.  At some point after 4-5 years of living in this state of horror daily, another ex-friend told me that he was told that the friend I'd betrayed had told him that he wanted me dead, and that he'd put a Voodoo curse on me.  He also told him that he'd ""have his revenge"".  Turns out that the first friend I mentioned and the second had both been into the darker side of the occult (necromancy, Druidism, etc) since they had some strange experience as teenagers, and that both still very much practiced.  

I tell you guys this story because I've definitely been there and know how it feels to live every day like this.  I haven't considered myself a ""TI"" in a few years now, thankfully.  On the other hand, I'm still working on finding a way to deal with this issue.  Without any doubt whatsoever, what I'm dealing with is spiritual warfare.  I believe that if it can be put on me or anyone else, then it can be removed as well.  Maybe you should ask your friend if they've had any contact or bad experiences with anyone that dabbles in the occult or witchcraft.  It might open some new doors of answers, and hopefully resolution."

Guitar,fctd0ep,t3_einlwl,1577939404.0,"My first guitar (a 3/4 length student electric I begged and begged my dad to buy when I was 13) sat against my wall in my bedroom for close to two years, if I remember correctly.  I'd pick it up and end up frustrated quickly.  I signed up for lessons at the only instrument store in my little hometown and only ended up going to one lesson; even then, I felt like for whatever reason that learning guitar in that way was taking a lot of the fun and magic out of what I was hoping to do with it.  One day after picking it up again around age 14-15, I started messing with the tuning keys a bit.  Somehow, I ended up in a haphazard Drop-D tuning; I quickly realized that in whatever tuning I was in that I could play what sounded like chords to me with just a finger.  Very soon after that I started playing along with albums of my favorite bands (which were bands like Foo Fighters, Green Day, Smashing Pumpkins, a bit later Deftones, etc) and learning what I could by ear; it seemed so much simpler to me than the other ways I'd tried, and every bit of that immediate fun was still there.  I started a band with a few of my friends around that time, and we had an absolute blast always.  But...after maybe 6-8 months of playing together, we realized that if we wanted to play certain songs we'd have to learn how to play in standard tuning as well.  So we learned, and I still think that learning to play by ear in a tuning like Drop-D made it that much easier on us three to learn to play using actual chords in standard.  I played in another band after that one, and have played off and on with other guys since.  I still play constantly at home years later, but to this day I honestly don't know the names of any chords other than the major ones and don't know if I could even name them correctly lol.  But I like it this way; for me guitar never became a chore or boring or work.  It's always been what gave me the most satisfaction (along with drums, which I learned in a similar non-taught way), and I'm sure it'll continue to.  Above all, music never fell out of the place it always held: as my first love."

Maybe not on his ""level"" (or Will Graham's from Hannibal), but I've found out from living as one for the past 36 years that it's a very real thing.  I didn't find out until I was almost 30; it took me being attacked with, for lack of a better term, forces I had no idea or even truly believed existed by someone I considered family for many, many years to realize this.  In fact, him telling me this might be one of the only real and true things this literally evil person ever told me.  It answered so many deep questions I'd always had about myself and was never able to find.  But most of the time, it's just a curse to live with; there's no fun, knowledge, peace, or happiness whatsoever in being able to literally feel even complete strangers's pain, and know very much why they feel that way.  Seeing through the people you love and seeing completely their true motivations doesn't help either.  Being so  hard to lie to isn't much help peace of mind-wise when you're always trying to see the good in others when there sometimes isn't very much.  Anyways, just wanted to share this with you guys.  I'm behind on S3, but I'm very much enjoying it so far.  Can't believe there's only one episode left!"
