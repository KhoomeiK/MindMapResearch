I am not entirely sure what it is your asking but I will do my best.

Leafly is a great resource.  I want you to google ""terpines Cannabis"".  There is a chart somewhere that breaks down the terpines and what relief they offer (its in a circle).  Using it as medicine you are going to look for strains that have the highest natural terpine profiles for your conditions.  For myself I use 707 headband from cresco.  Its terpine profile helps with anxiety, depression, and appetite.  I do switch to another strain though for nighttime so I can sleep.  Has it fixed everything well no not at all.  It does provide me a buffer though where before I would have to take an extra pill or 2 for migranes each episode, but I can take recommended dosage and smoke. It really really helps with depression and panic attacks for me but I can not stress enough how important it is to know the correct strain you need (dispensaries will help with this).  Also if you dont like smoking you can use RSO it is thick oil that you can add to food drinks ect.  Most folks put it in coffee in the morning.  Hope that was what you were asking about"

Depends on character of service if you say you were UA for 4 years OTH, if its unable to fill your job due to medical conditions (clearance) then it would be honorable.     This is such a slippery slope and the UCMJ really is a network of potholes that you can fall in."
veteran,fbjb62r,t3_edgbvi,1576929557.0,"I was an HR guy in the Navy and an intel guy later in life.  I am can give you pure speculation just based on personal experience from those 2 fields.

First and foremost you need to get a hold of someone at the DAV and ask them for guidance, you will want representation.

Second ... It seems they tried to contact you via registered mail.  I remember I had to keep them updated all the way up until this year when I went permanent on my address.  During my homeless stretch I still technically could have been ordered to a medical evaluation for duty fitness, or to DC to review my clearance.  You will need to explain why they were not able to contact you.  When you have a clearance you are not just considered IRR and not tracked.  Not sure how else to say this without sounding corny but your clearance makes you a government asset and they like to know where their assets are.

Third this doesn't say they are adsep you.  This says that your CO has the option under those two articles to do that but command understands there may be extenuating circumstances, hence 45 days to get your shit in order.   Your biggest thing is going to be showing why you were unable to maintain contact with command, why registered mail was returned undelivered, and your disability rating or injuries prevent you from holding an active clearance.  

Your clearance being yanked is what started this.  Your CO got notice from the security manager about it, and every CO wants to know why they are carrying a clearance on their Vault roles that benefits nothing to the command.  He then probably contacted HR who said we haven't been able to reach this guy.  Here is our returned green label to the address we have on file.  CO says find him now, and look they found you lol.  

Having said all that get representation I am may be way off base.  You haven't done anything wrong necessarily it just looks like administratively you fell through cracks which happens a lot!  You unfortunately have a clearance so your name shows up in red type when its suspended, and they look to see what crack you fell in."

There is nothing more frustrating than thinking you are gonna blaze out on some GG and instead you are licking the bottom of your Pax pod just for relief.  Frustrations though don't excuse poor behavior.  I really think everyone from the Growers on down to patients need to remember we are all on the same team and we are all human beings that is above all else the most important rationale to have.

The ONLY blame or well lets not even call it blame lets call it room for improvement, when it pertains to the dispensaries is the lack of communication.  I understand that you can only relay information which you are privy to I think an explanation on product timeline for each grower that the dispensary carries would be cool.  It would be awesome to know that Cresco has a 707 grow that is in flower then I could put some $ back until it arrived.  Right now its kinda like pissing in the wind on which strains are going to be around this week.  I also think a dispensary should have its own, visible, strain feedback for patients to provide to the growers.  There are kiosks at my  one CY for ""how was my service"" (which I always put 5 because lets be real we are buying cannabis in a store I waited 30 years for this shit) I think an added optional feedback for strains would help the market not feel so random number generator.  I am sure if Standard Farms or any grow (except moxie they gives no fucks lmao) found out that 70% of the PA anxiety market loves X strain they would formulate their grows over the next year  to meet that.  I think new patients would benefit by being able to get a feel on strain to value from other patients.   Right now I feel that as a patient my voice only matters when I pay for product, and people who aren't even in the game make my decisions for me on availability of medicine.  On top of that their decisions are based on money and not treatment which only compounds the feeling that I am being raked over the coals.  If I had the privilege and had my own dispensary my Green Team would be an immediate POC for market trends, patient feedback trends per strain, and general knowledge about terpines and the different types of medicine administration.

My step mother runs our dispatch including the surrounding counties (4 counties I think are combined for our system).  My father is a retired Police Officer for the city.

When I came home I couldn't make sense of real life.  I mean every single day of the previous 15 years I was surrounded by people in uniform who refused to walk on grass.  Now everyone cutting through yards ... obviously this is a silly and non violent  example but it was a reality for me.  After 2 weeks of sleeping 3 hours a night I was having a harder and harder time making sense of things.  One night there were cats on the back porch.  I checked the door and didn't see anything except their shadows.  I proceeded to check all the locks in the house 5 times in row.  During my panic I had left the side door unlocked and did't have the thought process to say ""Oh maybe I unlocked it"".  Nope it was an intruder who wasn't there to murder me, they were there to kidnap the DV I was responsible for protecting .... my grandmother.  I proceeded to wake her up, explain why she needed to sleep in the middle of the living room with her silhouette on the wall not the window.  My grandmother at the time (she since has passed) was dealing with dementia.  Obviously my own situation exasperated her illness.  So now you have me protecting my Grandmother who completely understands our situation.  She tells me that folks have been trying to get into her house for years.  I told her they have been trying to kidnap her but I would protect her at all costs.

Well one of my wonderful neighbors (I mean that without /s they saved my life) saw our lights going on and off, and me opening the doors for an hour and got concerned (I was slamming them closed)  called 911.  Guess whose mama answers that call .... yours truly!   So she sent a family friend who is on duty to check on us (we aren't answering the phone so the bad folks didn't know we were home).  This guy bangs on the door like the Police do, but I knew better.  He called out he was a Police Officer, said his name, told me we were friends, but fuck if I didn't 100% believe that he was a terrorist.  They ended up calling my Dad because I refused to open the door and was threatening them if they came in.  Pops used his key to come in the basement door.  When he got there we were sitting in the middle of the room blankets on top of us, pillows against the windows, couch moved to block the door, and a chair on top of the bed so I could sit and see out the window for bad guys.  After my Dad let the police in they decided I should go to the hospital, pink slipped.  I couldn't understand at that point why my Dad had turned into a bad guy, and why I was in trouble for protecting my grandmother.  3 weeks later, treatment, and sleep I was able to get past that reality.  This happened 4 times over two years (not including grammy) where I had lost my grip on reality.  I was never given a charge, but it got to the point the Judge was checking on my attendance at my outpatient appointments.  Also if I had a weapon in the house (FYI I can buy a gun with all this mental shit going on but I refuse) then that would have been enough reason to have me removed from my grandmothers house permanently.

I am telling you all of this so that you can have a perspective from someone who is mentally ill.  There is no sense to made from a thought process that is hindered by illness or disease.   It is not illegal to be mentally ill.  It is not a crime to have hallucinations or disassociation.  I don't know the laws but i know the process I went through.  I know I was privileged enough to have my parents in the positions they were or the outcome could have been totally different.  At some point risk assessment should start to show danger to that lady or loss of life/property is higher than the fallout from a pink slip and mandatory treatment.   I can ask my mother though once she wakes up how she would handle it and follow up if you like."
Veterans,f8qb3uh,t1_f8qar4h,1574714921.0,If revoked you would have had notice from your security officer in advance that you would gap your clearance this sounds like you got it taken.  Also suspensions can be argued while in position before expiration or revocation this sounds terminated or your investigation turned something up
Veterans,f8qaqzq,t3_e1klag,1574714765.0,Also it wouldn't have been local who canx it because they can see all their submissions to canx had to before where your at now
Veterans,f8qalsa,t1_f8qa8b1,1574714701.0,Yes then it was terminated only a FSO or you can submit in writing to that place in DC. Sorry I dont have a better solution
Veterans,f8q9uzj,t3_e1klag,1574714365.0,"So here was our policy I worked in a vault at X command.  Yes your clearance does not need to be re-investigated for x amount of years, it didn't mean the clearance remains active once your need to know is done.  The only time we held clearances open were when military members had follow on orders, or employment within the same ecosystem they were on duty for.  For civilians they were required to submit a request to extend their need to know date up to 45 days.  Sometimes the powers that be would allow it to go to 60 but usually the Company was involved at that point with our bosses.  Revoked is what our system would mark when we denied to extend their need to know.  Someone else could activate their unexpired clearance but we didn't need it anymore.  So I am going to guess either your clearance is terminated (which we dont have enough info to tell you this) or you do not have a need to know, therefor you have a clearance but it would only require a short investigation to get you read in and active again.  Also they did notify you I promise .... via your security officer at your command I would assume.  Also no security officer I ever met notified separated members their clearances were being suspended or anything."

BlackPeopleTwitter,f8511ip,t1_f84zwq1,1574265285.0,"So for me I ""found religion"" as well during a manic phase and it was probably 2 or 3 years before I even had a diagnosis.  I spent roughly 9-12 hrs a day reading and researching the foundations, impact, and solutions that religion offered.  The issue was that ever time I read an article about x or y religion, manic me felt I had discovered some deep spiritual insight that nobody else in the world would even begin to understand  ..... mania 100% grandiose sense of entitlement.  When I tried to manipulate my moods initially after diagnosis I used religion as a perverted way to justify my INSANE sense of reality.  I would use it as a weapon on others who didn't understand me ... they just weren't woke.  I lost a lot of what could have been good solid people because of that.  

Managing bipolar type 1 is different than the other 2 types of bipolar. This version (call it hardmode) makes you cycle up and down constantly.  The issue comes with medications.  There isn't one that brings you up from lows AND down from highs.  Its one or the other.  So it takes about 45 days to therapeutic levels (just my own experience) but type 1 you will have cycled up and down 2-10 times in that span.  So my doc because of my self control medicates my manic phases and gives me a mood stabilizer to assist with the depression.  If I swing to low I have to go into the hospital or get monitored while I fast switch to anti depressant.  I usually do not tell them when I am depressed because those medications are what made me not manic err not ""Awesome creative super genius"" I ride out the depressive stages as best I can to keep the ability to write. Zoloft paxil all that shit just makes you a zombie, BUT there are times being a zombie is the CORRECT decision.

BlackPeopleTwitter,f84xzwa,t1_f84lras,1574263349.0,"I have a TBI and BP type 1 the TBI fucked up my ability to make rationale decisions when flooded with a huge amount of stressors or environmental triggers.  Couple that with bipolar manic episodes and I was 140 mph church going gang banging drug dealing granny walking son father all at the same time.  Rationale was not possible.    After the brain injury I was very easily manipulated.  I could be told the earth was flat and I would have put some credence into it being real.   I am on year 6 now of recovery and its hard but no way would I ever fall for the emotional manipulation I did before.  I still require people around me I can trust to help me in a good direction.  As hard as it is though I do own every decision I made and the effects it had on those around  me that is probably why I have a support system now.  Sadly for a bipolar person you cant expect that to be there when they are manic its a fleeting thought.   I do not think I could actually get better being in his position.  There is just way way to many triggers and flooding going on.  I go back on meds after I spent all mah money lol this dude doesnt have that problem nor does he have people telling him to real help.

You have one year from the date of the denial letter the VA sent to file an appeal, called a Notice of Disagreement (NOD). There are no extensions for this deadline. 

I don't want to post links and get in trouble but I searched ""veterans benefits statute of limitations appeal"" and that was the info given.   

I know you can appeal but you may want to talk to a Veterans org, rep, or VSO.  They will help you through the appeals process.

If that office feels patients are being railroaded after that year, they have the power to fully regulate the market.  This will normalize prices for patients in my state, but it could upset surrounding markets in other states.
