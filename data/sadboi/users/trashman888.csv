depression,ff7z61o,t1_ff7vun1,1579661856.0,"I have been happy recently, I haven't been taking anything to heart really. I kinda lost emotion to everything but things always come back i guess. I wouldn't say i'm depressed rn though. I'm just angry at my circumstances and I feel like im not doing much to change it. Being quiet and reserved for their satisfaction. but as i learned from a book that i can't remember, ""you won't get what you want till you demand / fight for it"". But anyways, I hope you are doing good in life !"
depression,ff7yx29,t1_ff7vqdx,1579661681.0,I watch my weight a lot but I see what you mean 100%.  that reminds me though. I've had ab 5 or 6 cats that died in ab a 10 month span. all because of my parents. they'll do some stupid stuff like leave them outside in a rainstorm or just not take them to the vet. I always get angry at my mom for getting cats. My cat moon died about 3 weeks ago. I found out on saturday because my mom never told me. I told her that if she gets any more cats i'm out of there though. hurts a lot cause I am a cat person lol. thank you for the hope though!

depression,ff7yl14,t1_ff7uypn,1579661447.0,i've been to one before. they legit just shitted on me n called me crazy. it's because I told one of my teachers I was gonna cap myself a few years back. they'll never get the message. I have no hope for them.

mentalhealth,fatqfug,t3_ealme9,1576340688.0,"Being depressed has also been making me lose weight. I went from 120 to 113 pounds. I'm 5'8 too. ppl call me a skeleton when I take off my shirt in the locker rooms at PE. you can't see it on my face, but super obvious on my body."
mentalhealth,fatpotl,t3_ealme9,1576340482.0,"I've lost all my friends due to this, due to never being able to see them and my parents calling them criminals. I do sneak out to see them, and they are welcoming and are happy to see me. They never ask me to meet up anymore, or go places with them and it makes me very sad, but I don't blame them. I understand why."
