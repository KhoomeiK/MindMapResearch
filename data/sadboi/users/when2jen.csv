I've been depressed the last few months (diagnosed) and as a result, I can barely get the energy or motivation to speak. But my LDR (N.Y. to UK) boyfriend calls me every other day or so, to check I'm ok. He is not the most outgoing, so he tries really hard to make conversation to cheer me up. 

The reason I'm telling you this, is because that's the kind of effort, love and understanding you deserve. In your above comment you said he expects you to have an itinerary and if not, he gets to ignore your existence. That's just awful behaviour and you sound lovely. You can do so much better."
