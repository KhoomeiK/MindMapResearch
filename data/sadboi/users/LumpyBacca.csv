criticalrole,fiyzl17,t3_fak41u,1582850622.0,"My story is not particularly interesting but it\`s probably one of the weirder ones. 

So, first of all, we need to establish that I haven\`t heard about anyone from CR cast before I started watching the show. Of course, I heard *them* in various video games but I\`ve never had a habit of googling the voices. Liam O\`Brien, in particular, was triggering some strange primal sense of anxiety in me in the first couple of episodes until I realized he\`d voiced that fucking mage in that fucking Fade quest in the first Dragon...ok, calm down, breathe, it\`s over now, just breathe.

Back to the point! Aside from videogames, my other hobby is watching good bad films. I like cult trash of all genres but fantasy has always held a special place in my heart. The 80s and modern, a lot Syfy channel stuff, films like that.  Tbh, I don\`t even really like calling them trashy because some of them are genuinely quite good. I mean, the last Dragonheart movie is no Lotr in execution or budget but it\`s still a delightful story, ok. 

So one day years ago I, a big Kevin Sorbo fan (in a sense that I like his terrible flicks, he\`s not a great guy himself, not at all) stumbled upon Mythica, well, the first three films in the series at that moment. Now, if you\`ve never heard about Mythica, you are in a majority but trust me that these films are terrible and magnificent and as cheesy as they get. And guess who plays the villain? My fellow Critters, just do yourself a favor and watch them if you haven\`t already. It\`s kinda a commitment cos there are 5 films (I think they\`re all on Prime) but it\`s so worth it. The performance Matthew Mercer gives in these is like a strange lovechild of Jeremy Irons from ""Dungeons and Dragons"" and Kylo Ren. It\`s a whole experience in and on itself. Also, if you\`ve ever wondered where Matthew Mercer got his costume in the old VM in-character intro, the answer is that\`s literally what his character in Mythica wears. 

Then two years ago I finally got sick of seeing the gifs of this new show about people sitting around the table and talking and decided fine I\`m gonna watch it. The first couple of episodes of the season 2 have been out already so that\`s where I started. I put on the first episode on YouTube and immediately got this weird Deja Vu feeling of ""where the fuck could I\`ve seen this guy"". But I\`m stubborn so I\`m like: ""I\`m not gonna google him. I can figure this out myself"". And then they went to the circus where zombies attacked and their DM started making evil noises and I fell off my fucking couch. Holy shit is this the guy from those dumb fantasy movies where Kevin Sorbo plays Obi-Wan Kenobi? Holy shit it is the guy from those dumb fantasy movies where Kevin Sorbo plays Obi-Wan Kenobi! He made it! Yay!  


And that was the exact moment I was sold because I knew that there is no one more perfect for running dnd than someone who could act their heart out in a film where Kevin fucking Sorbo plays Obi-Wan Kenobi (also, Hodor shows up in the last one!) And, you know, I\`m glad I stuck around because this show gave me the courage to finally find a group and become a DM after 5 years of just reading dnd-books and lore. Everyone in the group I dm for is a Critter and every one of them is a great and respectful player."

criticalrole,fix5nuu,t1_fiw636y,1582813254.0,You\`re right! Sorry I\`m a dumbass! Matt puts it on at about 10:05 at the end of his recap
criticalrole,fivoorc,t3_fa26wf,1582764691.0,There is no leader. There is one collective brain cell that gets passed around the table to the person with the shittiest roll at the moment. That\`s it. That\`s how these two groups function.
criticalrole,fityhgr,t1_fiq7jmn,1582732039.0,That could be quite an insidious plan but unless TMN\`s adventures are gonna last for more than 15 years in-game it\`s not a very interesting turn from the narrative point.
criticalrole,fiordvp,t1_fio8ahc,1582589209.0,I feel like the Assembly (or at least some of them) tots know that TMN were the one who stole the Zadash Beacon and gave it back to the Dynasty. It was heavily hinted that there are agents on both sides. Someone clearly modified that poor guy\`s memory and got him framed for giving away the Felderwin Beacon and someone had to give the not-Astrid a shiv and loosen her chains.
criticalrole,fiodne8,t3_f8wzvz,1582581204.0,"The Assembly is not dumb. They know the Krynn are religious af. They know ""This is the Beacon you\`re looking for"" handwave is not gonna work here. 

So we have 2 scenarios: Either the Beacon the Assembly has shown TMN is actually the Fereldwin one and they are keeping the newly found one and all this legend about the archeological find is partly just diplomatic bullshit to try and cover up their asses: yeaah, we\`ve totally just found this one lying around in the dirt suuure"", or TMN is actually being played here. They were chosen as a fall guy for whatever the Assembly is planing. In the end, they are just a bunch of mercenaries with questionable loyalties. No one really cares for them, In the eyes of the Empire, they are expandable and it\`s not like they are ride or die with the Queen. Yeah, she stopped her attack on their word but she also scried on them (and possibly keeps doing it). She can be convinced they were traitors all along quite easily with some evidence.   
This being said, I do think that the Assembly has 2 beacons but Trent has a separate agenda of his own regarding one of them and he King most likely knows only about the dug up one."
writing,fio54tt,t3_f8urry,1582576481.0,"I usually get this feeling when I\`m in the middle of my wip (the part of any project that is also known as the great bog of dispair) so I try to remind myself that the only reason this new shiny idea seems so perfect and easy is because I\`ve just got it and I\`m not far enough into it to see the same problems I\`m experiencing at the moment. 

This being said, nothing wrong with having an ""affair project"" where you can run away from time to time to write a scene or two as long as you come back to your wip and finish it. Ok, adultery is probably a really bad metaphor for this but you get what I\`m saying here."

Fantasy,fhz17gz,t3_f5iuwp,1581988518.0, Magic realism is like a polite way of saying you write fantasy.  (c) Terry Pratchett

criticalrole,fgzlupm,t3_f0r9j3,1581195410.0,"There is no way these talks are gonna go smoothly but a direct attack Conclave-style from an outside source (sorry, ppl,  Uko'toa is not gonna eat the ship) would be derivative and not really fitting the theme of this storyline. I personally think that TMN not mentioning that the Beacon the Empire offers is not actually the stolen one is gonna come bite them in the ass. The Bright Queen will be very offended and pissed when she realizes it\`s not the same one."
criticalrole,fgzgtb6,t3_f0lzcy,1581194032.0," Lunapocalypse is the best! I love their animations so much! The colors, the movement, the editing, it\`s so good! When The Legend of Vox Machina is out CR should hire them to work on a TMN show"
criticalrole,fgtygqm,t3_f06wo6,1581110999.0,The Traveller reveal was very Pratchett-esque.
