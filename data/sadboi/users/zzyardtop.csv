ObjectivePersonality,fr2c5tk,t3_gm63nc,1589834763.0,"I’m not sure why it’s organized that way, but taking a quick peak, it is organized from inside outward and by first function letter. 

So in that section, the first layer to this would be Lead N (the larger yellow colored band), then cut in half by the deciders (T/F) in this case (two smaller bands offset outwardly from the large one), and then quartered based on lead animal (sleep on the inside, play on the outside), and then split into each individual animal order.  

So all 3’s are Ni/Fi. All 13s are Ne/Fi. All 17’s are Ni/Fe. All 27’s are Ne/Fe. And all of these are double feminine. 

Section 11 is Ti/Ne because that section is First function thinking (large blue band). And everything else in that chunk of the chart is lead thinking (Te or Ti). 

Hope that makes sense."

It really depends on the intent. Picking at yourself until you bleed could also be a sign of OCD or another anxiety issue you don’t have control over. If your doing  it consciously to cause yourself harm then yes.

I’m really sorry your going through this. I’m also a guy and I started cutting when I was 16 years old. Got a handle on it right before I turned 17. 8 years later I still battle with feeling like I want to Self harm when things get bad. Feels like my legs and arms are just screaming at me sometimes. I almost broke that streak earlier this week. 

The biggest thing that helped me was just trying to fix my issues. Medication, therapy, putting a little distance between things I have traumatic connections with, and focusing on self growth all helped. Trust me, it wasn’t easy tho. It was hard work, but going toward healing let me reign in those feelings when they got intense. 

Also, I had to keep the mentality that if I did relapse, it didn’t mean I was a failure. I just had a little setback. Having that bar set not so high made/makes it feel attainable for me. 

I hope you’re in a safe environment. That’s gonna be a huge step in the right direction. And please, if you notice yourself becoming more depressed and possibly suicidal, reach out to someone. I almost killed myself because I didn’t know It wasn’t “normal” to feel that way. Most people don’t have SH lead to being more depressed, but for me it did. Just keep an eye on it.

ObjectivePersonality,fprw9gz,t1_fprrvhg,1588863247.0,"If a persons environment mismatches their savior functions, it’s going to cause distress, and could lead to escapism. For example, if a lead Oi is in a particularly chaotic environment, they may escape by controlling things. How ever, you could also have a lead Oe that organizes things as a hobby. That’s why you have to get down to the root. 

I can’t give you a comprehensive list. In addition to what I said above, there are a lot of things, for example childhood trauma/abuse, that could result in escapism, that are not bound to any particular type. Again, in this case you’d have to look at both the what and the why, because the different types are going to react differently to the same problem. 


I think it would be better if you did some consume/sleep on it. Research it out some more, think about how you do it in your own life, others you know who do it, and come up with the why. Go back over what you know about Opt and escapism and see where there’s overlapping. Keep those patterns in the back your mind, and as you get more info on it go back over what you know."

And probably, unless it’s an pretty heavy amount, escapism in some form is pretty normal for a lot of people. And like a lot of things in op, even if there is clustering (there might be with this idk), it doesn’t mean other types can’t.

While it’s true, if your body/brain hadn’t reacted in the way it did, or if you just hadn’t gone thru what you did, you would have developed differently than you did currently. 

But the flip side is true too. Even if you had no traumatic events that shaped you, you would have continued to develop differently from who you were when you were younger.

Who’s to say you post trauma is no more you, than a version of yourself with no trauma, or any in between amount of trauma? 

What’s really nice about this, is that there is no perfect “blueprint” version of you. So when you’re ready and able to, you can move toward growth, even with a painful past.

EMDR essentially helps you reprocess traumatic experiences in a way where they won’t be as traumatic in the future. It can be very hard because you relive experiences, but if you can go through that, it usually is very effective for PTSD 

From healthline.com (link below): 

“During EMDR therapy sessions, you relive traumatic or triggering experiences in brief doses while the therapist directs your eye movements.

EMDR is thought to be effective because recalling distressing events is often less emotionally upsetting when your attention is diverted. This allows you to be exposed to the memories or thoughts without having a strong psychological response.

Over time, this technique is believed to lessen the impact that the memories or thoughts have on you.”

I would be around triggers, and while I wasn’t picturing what happened, I had the same physical sensations I did during the initial traumas, until I overloaded. Then I would either almost fall asleep or go hide and blank stare, then (typically) enter a very horrible visual dissociative state. I was basically dropped into horror movies of my brains making or very X-rated situations i couldn’t get out of, that were usually far worse than anything I was actually experiencing at the time.

ptsd,fp6mxv5,t3_gblj3s,1588355097.0,"Part of being diagnosed with anything (especially but not limited to something chronic) is a period of denial and/or acceptance. I don’t care if it’s PTSD or an injured leg; world view is different, and you have to adjust. 

For some people, they’ve wrestled with the idea that something more is wrong, even if they didn’t have textbook experiences (e.g. rape, being in war), and they’re open to hearing whatever diagnosis comes out of it. For others, that idea never may have crossed their mind, and now they have to process that. And the way some people process is by talking to others. And it can take a loooonnngg time. 

Also, idk about you, but for some of us, guilt/shame is a large issue. Society as a whole can be scary. PTSD is a very real and major issue that has stigma and preconceived notions about it. As a result, you can be scared to ever admit that you have it. You might want to test the waters online before you are able to have the strength to bring it up in real life. 

Some people feel that even tho there are others who went thru almost the same issues, they’re different, or what happened was slightly different, and as a result need help in clarifying. This is a support group after all. 

And, while I haven’t done a lot of studying on it personally, I would imagine that PTSD and low self esteem are really tied together for some (myself being one of them). Not feeling “worthy of” or feeling like what they went thru was “bad enough” can be part of that. Even if they went through horrible things. 

With all that said, I do wish people would research what actually qualifies and then come ask. If what your counting as trauma very clearly doesn’t meet the guidelines, then you should probably look at your issues stemming from another issue. But if someone is genuinely wrestling with going through trauma and just can’t accept it might be PTSD, then I think we should point them in the right direction.

ObjectivePersonality,fp3wbga,t3_gb5p43,1588287010.0,"An Istj of any type is going to have a few things going on:

-Single observing

-Savior Sensory/what is happening

-Savior Organize

-Demon Abstract/why is something happening

-Demon Chaos


With that in mind, Si (no matter how much activation/masculine energy) is going to be afraid of:

-The other side of the information (wants to look at the same facts or in the same spots for info)

-Not sticking to their known sensory (e.g. their routine)

-The unknown (won’t like/be responsible to guess and won’t “jump” over information)

-Will track what is happening, but wont understand the why

-Chaos being thrown at them (Oi will overwork control/organize, and eventually chaos with be thrust on them, causing a negative tidal wave)


Istj’s can also have tribe or identity issues as well, but they will not be as intense as observer issues: the things!

A good rule of thumb: if you know what the opposite type likes or does in a savior state (what is Ne doing all day?), then you know exactly what’s going to scare that type (Si).

My coworker just quit in a hissy fit about pay (and yes I know the specifics). So I have to pick up all his pieces and go back to a managing everything and now train someone new. Had my first day of physical work today since I left, and I almost broke down balling on the way to work. I had to drive past both buildings where a lot of my trauma occurred on my way to work. And I will for at least the next 3 months, probably longer. I was callused to it, but now it’s just fresh hell. I had been worried about coming back because it felt like I was coming back to prison. I was surprised I was kinda okay so far. And then it hit me today: I’m back. 

Plus... I had completely forgotten that I had been dealing with some potential repressed memories. Like I spent time in therapy on them, it plagued me for over a year before I moved. And then I just forgot about it. I ended up being reminded of it while talking to one of my friends before I came back and I just broke down. I don’t want to deal with that right now but I’m afraid I might not have a choice now."
ptsd,fllrqbi,t3_fphvf2,1585266405.0,"I didn’t do this with clothes but I had some items that I had put in moving boxes around 8 years ago, and then we went thru a series of moving and I never opened some of the boxes. About 6 months ago when I was finally able to move out, I went thru everything and got rid of a lot of items I didn’t even realize I still had that were still triggering. 

Very cathartic"
ptsd,fl90gu4,t3_fmz52f,1584937201.0,"I did EMDR for about a year and a half. And then another half year after roughly a year of stopping therapy. It worked for me and honestly I felt like it was helping me just re frame the way my brain would perceive what happened. I probably need to go back soon to process some things that have come up recently from the past. I also appreciated it because I got to work on it myself. I really like to process internally and alone. I didn’t have to process as much out loud and I was doing it with a therapist I trusted, so I was okay with her in the room. 

As much as it helped, it can be very painful. We used little handheld paddles that would vibrate and I would close my eyes. I had a session where I ended up curled in the fetal position crying holding the paddles. It’s not for the faint of heart. 

Please read other people’s cautions in the post regarding it tho. I don’t really feel like going into detail on my therapy right now"

ptsd,fktlbbe,t3_fkgdq1,1584525066.0,"I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to manage my symptoms so that I can get out more than I was before. But I definitely felt that way before... recently my physical health has been getting worse, which has been effecting my mental health. On top of that, I moved out of the states about 5 months ago. It was supposed to be me finally getting away from an area I had all my trauma in. Like the last piece to the puzzle. 

I don’t have a visa, which isn’t a problem normally, it just means every 90 days I have to leave the country and then I can come back in. As of yesterday the government here has said it will close its borders to people with out visas. So once I leave (which my date is coming up in less than a month), I’ll be going from a place where the panic is pretty low and things are kinda under control, back to the mass panic in America, back to California where it’s a big problem, back to prison. The idea alone is tanking my mental health.

ObjectivePersonality,fkpyyd6,t3_fjvaqf,1584423935.0,"Consume comes in lots of different flavors, like watching YouTube, Audiobooks, going out to a new restaurant, concerts, just new experiences for the self. If it really is low consume, than it’s just practice. Your last animal (even your third animal) is just gonna be tough, and you’ll only get thru it by forcing yourself to small chunks at a time. 

Also, I think Dave and Shan are pretty right on when they say your other animals have to be full first. You might need to fulfill your other animals first, before you tackle consume. I don’t know your animal stack, but for me, I’m CS/B. I have to consume first. Then move to sleep. If I’ve done that, Blast is somewhat easy. Once I’ve don’t enough blast then I can finally do play comfortably. If I have to do play first, for even a short period of time, I’m zapped for at least an hour or two. 

Hope that helps."

And yes definitely... I would argue that most of my other “problems” are only unmanageable when the PTSD is bad. They don’t go away but I can handle them when the other stuff is handled. I know the same goes for one of my other friends with it. I had no idea about ADHD. I should research that... when it’s not 3 in the morning lol..."
ptsd,fkl1wrh,t1_fkl0v63,1584296711.0,"I started looking something up that I saw in the comment and I think I misunderstood what was being said/what I was reading... I thought comorbidity was tied to the visual flashbacks or the dreaming of and reliving traumatic events. Which I don’t quite do. I still hit enough of the markers to qualify and I get like “bodily flashbacks”. But I’m pretty sure I’m wrong so literally my comments don’t matter now lol. 

And man the list of things I’ve been professionally diagnosed with:
PTSD
OCD
Body dimorphic disorder 
Mild ADHD
Mild Dyslexia 
Also Chronic Depression and Generalized anxiety but this was before the PTSD diagnosis. Not that I don’t have them but they’re definitely aggravated by the PTSD. I can actually manage those if the PTSD isn’t bad. 

Sorry for the confusion."
ptsd,fkkzuu5,t1_fkky6e3,1584295455.0,"I should have clarified, I ment that I possibly didn’t have the comorbidity part. I guess it’s just hard to think of someone else’s PTSD as being too dissimilar from your own, since their under the same medical definition/condition. But I know that’s not necessarily true. 

I was diagnosed with PTSD about 4 years ago, and have been struggling with it for roughly 9 years, and a butt load of anxiety and depression before that. I’m not here trying to get diagnosed, although I appreciate you pointing it out. Had I been curious if I had it, and people told me “it sounds like you have this issue”, It probably would have helped me bring up my issues sooner for treatment. 

Unfortunately I’m all to familiar with disassociation.  That’s my brains go to for anything. When it gets really bad, which is much less frequent now, my brain sometimes “goes” to worse places than what was actually happening. Huge chunks of my life are just missing too, and not from substance or alcohol abuse. 

It’s a monster. But I’m glad I found this subreddit. It’s just nice to hear from other people that have it."
ptsd,fkjpvke,t1_fkguecm,1584254440.0,"I had no idea this was a thing. I just thought some people dissociated more than others... like shit so my disassociating is not the same as other PTSD sufferers disassociating? That’s crazy... I thought it was normal to disassociate the way I did when you have PTSD... 

Also reading about Comorbidity and ptsd and I didn’t somehow didn’t put it together I might not have that? Correct me if I’m wrong but it seems to be linked to flashbacks or dreams? I have physical sensation flashbacks, like I get all the physical sensations back I remember feeling when things happened. Down to very specific pains in spots; Sometimes for no distinguishable reason and other times I was re-triggered. I never would actually see the events or dream about them? I would however dissociate heavily... a lot of times my brain would basically throw me into some kinda of x-rated “horror movie” while it held the remote, but it was never stuff that happened (I think... I have some big gaps in my memory)"

ptsd,fk3bhqh,t3_ffog4z,1583825446.0,"You need to talk with your therapist. When I did CBT it made me worse... every... time. I would leave wanting to SH the more I tired doing it or trying to use this workbook my therapist gave me for the days I didn’t see him. 

I later switched therapists (because my first one wouldn’t explore that I had something else past some depression and anxiety going on) and we did EMDR and that helped a lot more. It was still painful to go thru but I felt better after. And long term it did help with processing some things. Later on I was able to do some CBT. It still wasn’t easy but it was not the painful experience it was before. I hope your able to find something that helps."
ptsd,fk3asgx,t1_fk315df,1583824531.0,"Hey. So EMDR was a huge help for me. It was exhausting and very hard sometimes, but it truly helped me long term. I can’t say it “fixed” me, but it made it easier to resolve things in my head on my own and be more okay with certain events that happened. 

I should have probably stuck with it with my therapist but I ended up moving far away and now I’m realizing I still need help or maybe some medication. 

I really hope this goes well for you, and give EMDR some time to work for you."
depression,fk39ue0,t3_fg7t29,1583823343.0,"Not really. I was frightened a lot. Anxiety is probably more at the core of my identity than depression. 

Before I was diagnosed with all my issues I couldn’t dream. I would sleep so heavy that I would fall asleep and be awake a few seconds later. However it was torture trying to fall asleep. My brain would fixate on very violent imagery that would cause me anxiety and physical pain watching them. I would wake up in odd positions with all my blankets twisted and pushed off the bed tho so I’m sure I was having dreams about that. I never felt rested either. Also would have sleep paralysis sometimes. 

After I was diagnosed with depression and some anxiety, and got some help I started dreaming. They were filled with pretty bad anxiety. I went thru a period where every night I would have a normal dream that would turn into me being tracked down and shot or just murdered. Sometimes multiple times a night. I would be killed and re-spawn somewhere else only to have it happen again. I’d also have intense dreams about natural disasters I couldn’t get away from. I’d wake up exhausted from my brain trying to chaotically throw things at me that I wasn’t dealing with yet. 

And later with more therapy and help I was diagnosed with ptsd, OCD, and minor ADHD. As I got more help thru the weeks my dreams became more “normal” for me (they’re very random and all over the place but harmless). However, when I have episodes of depression reoccur, I stop dreaming or they go back to just panic filled dreams. And I always wake up exhausted from these.

I think part of the reason (to answer your question) is that depression is more often a symptom, not the actual problem. Even tho it may be viewed as THE problem or currently may be the largest symptom. I didn’t know I had any anxiety issues until way later, but almost everything stems from anxiety for me.

But having glasses on seems to make people focus on those as your eyes instead of the ever growing black circles that look like you’ve never slept. 

Also idk why but telling people I’m tired when they ask how I am (cause I genuinely am), they’ve just come to expect I’m always tired. It becomes normal and people don’t being it up much anymore. It’s like it’s my normal state."

offmychest,fjxd5zt,t3_few99u,1583668494.0,"Was also diagnosed with the above. And yes I do the same thing when I get really bad. When I was stuck in public and my ptsd was triggered I would hide in a bathroom stall, a corner facing a direction people wouldn’t see, behind large plants, anything where I was hidden. Sometimes even just getting to the very back of a venue would help a little. Sometimes I would crawl in places and sit, but I was deathly and irrationally afraid of spiders and things just being in there, so I very rarely would go into very small spaces. Being so flighty, if anything brushed up against me I would have freaked out, and honestly a few times I did because I was so nervous I imagined something did brush against me. 

When I couldn’t leave as I got older my car became my safe space. I would go sit in my car and lock the doors with the windows barely cracked, seat all the way down and try to sleep or let the disassociation just play out while I laid there. Or I would just go driving, altho when I was really bad, I would disassociate the whole way home and have no idea how I got home; or alternately, I would almost keep driving on the freeway and pass my exit to runaway. Not that my home life was bad then but I just wanted to run away. Thankfully I never worried my parents doing that, they didn’t deserve that.

selfharm,fjn8yg0,t1_fjn82z4,1583501508.0,"Honestly, if she’s a halfway decent person, it might work itself out with time. My dad and fought constantly for years, it only got better once he found out how bad I was, cause literally no one knew I was more than slightly depressed when I was full on suicidal. But even then we still fought and I hated him for a while afterwards. I’d say after a few years we were about at a normal state too. 

We’re waaay better now. It took me a long time to work it out, but shifting my perspective on the whole thing, realizing for me he wasn’t my biggest problem, and trying to be more compassionate toward his struggles really helped smooth things out quicker than I feel they would have otherwise. He was going through a lot, so it wasn’t like I was the only one in pain then. 

I’m glad to hear it’s worked out more."
selfharm,fjn754v,t1_fjn6jwk,1583500015.0,"I cannot imagine being found out. Part of me slightly wanted it so I’d be forced but it never happened. It was hard enough telling people of my own accord. 

I tried on my shoulder the first time, but I couldn’t stand the feeling there, so I never did it there again. I had a very tiny raised scar there for - few years but that’s definitely gone now. I also tried any other method I could think of: Burning, pinching, punching, hair pulling. Nothing was quite the same tho.  

Part of me wishes I would’ve been on redit back then. But I had one friend who was older than me but fortunately for each other we were both going through very similar things at the time. Somehow I zeroed in on their pain, thought they would understand, and confided in the right person. Again I could not imagine someone finding out and then telling my family.

selfharm,fjn6453,t1_fjn5jdd,1583499107.0,"I know the feeling... I hit my lowest point halfway thru October. And then told my best friend on Halloween. Every October has been tough. I relapsed a few times but they were minor. Then i had my last relapse that next March, few days after my birthday. Both of them are kinda ingrained. For years I’d get really depressed around the time. It’s a better now but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t effect me still. Anniversary’s are very hard and might be for a little while, but at least they come and then go. 

Also yeah scars are not fun... I have the word “idiot” in my leg permanently. I did it at the end of a session and kinda had run out of steam so it wasn’t very deep. It’s very light and mostly faded but most the letters are visible in the right light. And then the March incident I did on my other thigh and those are still all there. They are Light but it’s hard to pass off a grid of scars as stretch marks. Also have a few tiny and now more flat keloid scars. I’m just glad I didn’t cut my wrists or arms."

I relapsed after 3 months initially, that incident would’ve been March 2012. It was one of my worse “sessions”... if you relapse don’t give up. It happens to practically if not all of us. 

Btw 3 months is great. Every third month until I hit a year I would remember. It’s a lot to be proud of. Keep it up!"

But recently moved really far away from my home town, and while that was a good thing, I have been dealing with some hits to my mental and physical health that have been taking a toll as of recently. I’ve had a few close calls, but thankfully not enough to relapse. Thank you for showing concern <3"
selfharm,fjmgzpi,t1_fjjutro,1583470353.0,"I started cutting secretly when I was going thru arguably the worst part of my life. I was in so much pain emotionally. I always cut on my upper thigh so no one would ever see it. At one point I ended up making very superficial and light scars on my upper forearms and purposely wore short or rolled up sleeves for a few days so people would see. This is probably one of the only times in my life I’ve “acted out” for attention because I was genuinely scared. I couldn’t vocalize the words, I wanted someone to *catch me* so I couldn’t hide it anymore. 

No one said anything, or more likely no one noticed. I was already not far from being suicidal, and this just pushed it over the edge; I was now in horrible emotional turmoil and “no one cared about me enough to say anything”. 

Looking back I know I probably didn’t actually show that spot on my arms much at all, it might have just looked like i had marks from rolled up sleeves, I might not have actually been around a lot of people to see it. And 8 years after my last relapse I still crave the feeling of it. It’s just a full on addiction I’m probably gonna fight until I die. 

TLDR: Listen to people when they come forward with Self harm or if you notice. I actually was someone who tried to once for attention. And it didn’t work, and then it intensified my actual self harm habits and mental health issues to the point I almost attempted suicide."

I did the same thing when I was like 16. I had periods where I was “fine” and then more and more frequently I would have an emotional outburst of tears alone in my room. Before that start I wasn’t really emotional, especially outwardly. It felt like more and more pressure kept building and I’d release it but every time it would build faster.
