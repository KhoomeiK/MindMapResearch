2. I have paranoias or overthinking that my boyfriend will lost his interests on me or will love another woman.  

3. Well, I really want to be back old Melisa but I guess this answer doesn't count because that means overcoming anxiety soooo I would say uhmm... I don't really know. That's all about being happy and have my confidence back but it's also because of anxiety...."

AmItheAsshole,f0hwv4u,t1_f0htz5v,1568631970.0,"thank you for your great comment!!!!! It feels amazing to know that I’m not alone.   About “fake it till you make it” part, that’s the another thing I feel anxious about. When I’m faking about my feelings toward her, I actually can’t do it and feel like she sees my real feelings and judge me for that. Because that happened to me like a month ago, I had a manager at work who has an amazing energy, talkative and cheerish(idk how to say sorry haha) and I couldn’t eye contact her never. I was sitting next to her and whenever she tries to have a conversation with me, she saw that there is something wrong with me. And she was a bit bitchy, she liked that I was kinda jealous and she tried to trigger me more. I actually talked to her about it, I told her I’m dealing with some problems and I would never feel that way if I was healthy enough but of course she couldn’t understand me. So im not really good at faking. Being fake makes me feel worse and I just want to stop blame myself for feeling these feelings. It takes a lot of energy to blame myself really."
