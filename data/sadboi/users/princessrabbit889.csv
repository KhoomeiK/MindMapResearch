BPD,fh0xbm7,t1_fh0wirh,1581208511.0,"I feel that. Over the years I feel like I've gotten somewhat better at hiding it because even though he insists it's okay to be open with him about this stuff, I dont wanna add extra weight to his responsibilities. It's hard to balance, but experimenting to find an in between (yes, it supposedly exists XD) is the best way to go I think. I'm still experimenting too, we got this üíï"

relationship_advice,ffdr5zj,t1_ffdmt47,1579826925.0,"Thank you so much for your kind words and advice, its greatly appreciated! Being a self aware pwBPD is great in the sense that you can identify and label your problematic behavior after it occurs but the impulsivity is a real bitch, sometimes it goes hand in hand with the empty feeling in my case. It all happens so fast and thoughtless and the reactions just keep on coming and the panic runs high. 

Its only once it's too late that I realize what I've done and then the intense guilt/shame/fear sets in hard, start feeling suicidal (only acted a handful of times though), coping skills go out the window, chase the same ones I know I shouldn't and then feel awful about that too. I go through periods of emptiness after the bad intensities then once good things start happening again, I feel so damn happy and invincible that nothing could ever touch me. I feel like I'm even better than cured. The world seems like a whole different place. And then I destroy it by getting emotional over stupid stuff and/or being reckless and the cycle repeats. 

It's always me who destroys my own happiness for the most part. I just hate that I drag my loved ones down with me. Its childish and selfish and I hate it.
It drives me crazy. 
I promise myself that I'm not going to let it affect them anymore and soon after... it's like I'm a completely different person and I drag them down all over again. 

I definitely agree, its gonna take some years to fix this up. It just feels so hopeless everytime I take 3 steps forward then 6 steps back. The finish line gets further and further away, and with each time I mess up, I'm less forgiving towards myself. I know patience is essential here, but I cant take seeing how much this hurts the people around me. Seeing them hurt and knowing I was the cause is a whole different level of guilt. The kind that feels like you've just put a bullet through their happiness and their smiles and laughter and warmth is bleeding out, and it's all over your hands. I feel evil. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to respond. ‚ô°"
relationship_advice,ffdiu57,t1_ffd0m2i,1579821784.0,"Yes, as much as I feel ashamed to admit, I've been struggling with my symptoms since my earlier teen years (was passed off as puberty hormones and such, ""she'll grow out of it"" etc) but I wasnt officially diagnosed until I was 18 following a nervous breakdown after my abandonment issues went haywire and I was on the verge of suicide again. Black and white thinking is the main perpetrator in my arguments with the person I'm close with lately.

I had already done a CBT course months prior to the diagnosis and went to therapy all through my teen years too, so as a result my psychiatrist had me on a course of DBT which helped tremendously. Following that, I received ~12 weeks of psychotherapy and I felt well equipped enough to take things from there. Only that overtime, I slowly got worse at putting the skills into practice without that layer of support. I'm back on the waiting list for longer term therapy (this one is once a week for a year) and in the mean time my psychiatrist arranges appointments every couple of weeks or so to check in.

My psychiatrist said the exact same thing regarding the childhood trauma. I just hate these damn symptoms so much. I cant recall a single stable relationship I've had from the age of 14 and above (friendships included) and now I'm on the verge of being with the man of my dreams and everytime things start looking up for us, I destroy it. I really do try to be on best behavior for him and bury those symptoms deep but lately they've been slipping through the cracks again and I'm so worried that I'm going to do something to mess this up and he'll leave me for good and I wont be able to take it and things will be a slippery slope down from there."
relationship_advice,ffcvyu9,t1_ffcunry,1579808403.0,"I have been, but I'm out of one right now. I see my psych every ~2 weeks so I'm gonna see if she can shed any light here too, but until then, I dont see the harm in asking other people their thoughts on the matter from people who may have experienced similar issues. 
Thank you, I'll reflect on that."
relationship_advice,ffcvlmy,t1_ffcutz3,1579808181.0,"I'm so sorry to hear about that, I truly sympathize. As another user commented, I think building good habits with a healthy dose of self discipline will get us there. Sending love ‚ô°

Edit: I'd also like to suggest that if possible, you may find therapy to be helpful. I found DBT and CBT to be great for managing big emotions and working on healthy interpersonal skills."

(: as for how you're a mix of your parents, it sounds like you're perfectly balanced, as all things should be. :p haha. I wish you luck in your habit building! 

Thank you ever so much for your advice, I was feeling really hopeless before but your comment really makes me feel hopeful for the future ‚ô°  I'm going to focus on specific habits I want to enforce and take another look at my CBT & DBT workbooks."
