I can go from being a supremely functional, strong, capable human being to a total basket case in a second flat and for reasons that often seem mysterious or made up to other people. Something can trigger a memory based on a tone of voice, a smell or something that even I don't understand. If I have a lot of triggers in a short period of time, I actually get flu-like symptoms and can barely get out of bed. Then, the next day, I could be totally back to normal. I wouldn't believe it was real either if I wasn't experiencing it.

CPTSD,fmb6nfu,t1_fmb16e3,1585919723.0,"This is the exact problem I see with this perspective. Sometimes, people have their own baggage that comes up in relation to us that they can project onto us because they have the social power to do so. Is it our vibe that makes a person hate us for the colour of our skin? What about having a lifetime of experiences of prejudice based on something we have no control over? Does that create a deep wound that can be difficult to heal from? Probably.

I mean, sometimes it gives us power to reject being the victim and I think this is what this message is about, reclaiming our ability to control our own reality. This definitely has a limit though. There are some instances where people are being victimized, genocide for example. There are forces at work that are bigger than any individual's karma and we sometimes get ground up in the machinery. It's okay to acknowledge injustice and to feel powerless to change that injustice. Sometimes, there are things that hurt us that we have no power over. 

Like, there are stories of Buddhist monks being at peace even when people are stoning them to death. This is the end goal of the philosophy. We can maintain our own equilibrium even in the face of grave harm and injustice, but that's also some next level business. Am I there? Nope!

Another trap we can set for ourselves is judging ourselves for having an emotional reaction or becoming overwhelmed by an injustice being perpetrated against us. Would I be justified in being upset at someone trying to stone me to death? Hells yeah. I'm human and my body still has programming that reacts to pain. That's part of being a human.

We can only really wrestle back control over a period of time of self-reflection and training. Power lifters don't judge themselves for not being able to lift 400 pounds on the first day of training and neither should we. Reactions are normal and sometimes people are trying to victimize you. You can wrestle back control, but until then, it's okay to recognize that it hurts and to tend to your wounds."

relationship_advice,fkljt0d,t3_fj67us,1584307931.0,"I have been in codependent relationships before and this really feels like things that I went through, just in terms of never knowing where the line is. Someone can do something so heinous and never treat you well and you still love them and the idea of leaving them doesn't cross your mind. 

Honestly, I wonder if you have a low image of yourself in your mind. Like, maybe you should start asking yourself why it's okay that you do all this work when you have a disability and why you put up with someone lying to you? Like, what is it that makes that feel okay for you?

With long term relationships, your lives can be so entwined that it can be hard to pull back. When I was in your shoes, I started trying to rebalance the dynamic. I stopped doing all the extra work and started asserting some boundaries. 

If you're not ready to leave, at least start trying to figure out what your needs are and maybe work with your therapist to define what healthy boundaries might look like. You can start to move towards a healthier relationship with yourself first and that often helps put this other stuff into perspective."

It's good to switch it up at first and then if you find something that's really working to maybe stick with that for a while. The main thing is to be in-tune with your partner. If all else fails, ask for help. Most women, but not all, have an idea about what makes them feel good. It makes sense to do your homework with each partner, to learn their body. 

Listening to noises will help, also, you will want to learn what their body language means. Does tensing up = good feelings or bad feelings? Some women will get really relaxed when they're feeling good. So, it will be up to you to learn what the different signals mean.

Some basic things to explore will be how much pressure she likes (some women can't stand to have their clit touched directly, some love it), speed, direction, and then there's adding fingering into it. For some women, feeling full can help the whole process. Also, very important is soft tongue vs. hard tongue. You can have your tongue be tense to give an intense sensation or relaxed to have a more gentle sensation.

As a general rule, work your way towards the center, like start at the thighs, then the outer lips, the the inner lips. Then, softer to harder.

NVC,fk61k5w,t1_fk4h121,1583891861.0,"They were threats of rape and the person was stalking and threatening a number of women during what seemed to be a mental breakdown. Some of the women as well as the moderators knew the person in question from NVC retreats and the moderators kept assuring everyone that he was harmless. Though, he definitely didn't seem harmless to the people he was harassing and made a lot of women feel unsafe just knowing what was going on.

The problem as I saw it, was that people in positions of power can be blinded to their own privilege. They think that they would be able to deal with someone threatening them and so attribute someone else's reaction to them being less emotionally stable and less able to own their own feelings. This totally ignores differences in socialization where threats of rape can be realized and are realized for a significant proportion of women.

I think that NVC is a beautiful idea but is also absolutely being used by people to oppress and manipulate others and because you can always just point to the fact that you are using the right language and are doing all the right things, that the person getting upset must be the one doing it the wrong way.

It was totally useless to try to reason with the group. We formed a subgroup to try to communicate with the involved parties, poured our hearts out and we're ultimately shut down. I decided to leave for my own mental health."

They took the lessone the way that you did and then put the responsibility on a woman who was being sent violent and threatening messages. 

It ended up that a lot of women had to leave the space because it was unsafe for them. No explanation of privilege or trauma was accepted and we were treated as though we were less advanced for not being able to work through our feelings about someone threatening our physical safety. I get that the person was a human being and had their own story but I expected a basic level of respect for my own humanity too.

It really damaged my trust in the NVC community, though I'm sure not every space is like that, there were definitely some prominent people moderating those groups and their attitude was pretty startling."

If you are something just for yourself, then it's a hobby. You can absolutely make money from art, but you need to gear your art somewhat to people's tastes. Personal integrity doesn't pay the bills.

The whole idea of an artist being this person who shows people what they don't want to see about themselves works for verrrrryyyy few people and even so, those people probably had trusts funds to begin with. For us regular folks, if you try to show people their ugly truths, they will not thank you for it and certainly won't pay for the pleasure.

People want to feel good, they want to be comforted, they want to look at beautiful things, but this is not ""prestigious"" or ""high-art"". If you have that attitude, you've got to be prepared to suffer for your art, to live in poverty and possibly never be thanked or recognized during your life time. I don't think that most kids who liked drawing in high school are prepared for this reality and the toll that starving for decades takes on your body and mind, it hardly seems worth it."

It really depends on the individual's ability to deal with stress and a heavy workload. I'm in education but I can imagine that there would also be clinical hours that you'd have to complete, which could further affect your workload.

I started as a wiccan and have transitioned into heathenry over the years. I have been associated with numerous covens and groups ranging from Celtic Shamanism to Reclaiming. I guess I'm a spiritual wanderer. I work with energy and focus mainly on healing and divination.

Glad to have this space, thanks for starting it!"

It's that decision to get up and brush your teeth that starts it and then after hundreds of decisions just like that, you look around and notice that you're actually doing it, that thing that you always wanted to do. It's weird but good. I sometimes can't fully believe it because I've always felt like a burden, like no one would want me.

witchcraft,fjgkxqd,t1_fjfzud9,1583329492.0,"If we are agents of the universe, I think that sometimes we are able to deliver it's karma. Rage can be like the waves of the ocean, the raw and unfiltered emotion can express something deep that needs to be fulfilled. I don't regularly practice hexing, but I think it has it's place when we are seeking balance.

Personally, I am trying to untie all the knots and judgements that I have received from living under a judeo-christian ethos and I think that repression of anger and other emotions is a big factor, at least for me. Coming to a new understanding of hexes, has helped me to understand the grey nature of morality in the craft. It isn't necessarily ill-intent to want someone to face up to their crimes."
witchcraft,fjgkhnv,t1_fjfyw88,1583329160.0,That's a great point. It can also manifest in situations where oppressed people wouldn't necessarily be well served by the police. Not all people are protected by the powers in our societies and so at times they need to push their own resolution.

ZenHabits,fja1ond,t1_fj9zomw,1583164506.0,"For those who have emotional intelligence, gained through the process of attending to and learning about their emotions as they arise in daily occurrences,  it becomes more difficult to manipulate their emotions. It is ultimately easier to manipulate an emotion of someone who is not prepared to deal with and integrate it.


Living an emotional life does not mean that one is going around reacting to these emotions, but rather, attending to them and accepting them as one facet of one's interior reality."

It's recommended by a lot of doctors for those who suffer from ibs and various other issues like that. It's not a fad diet or anything, just eliminating a certain kind of sugar that some people can't digest well. Things like gluten and lactose and high on fodmaps so my partner doesn't eat those."
Empaths,fikrgjo,t3_f87zlq,1582485866.0,"Sometimes I get jumbled up because I don't always understand every bit of the messages I receive. Also, I tend to be able to see the good in people, even when it's deep down and I can give that greater relative importance than other stuff. 

For example, my partner is better at reading ""types"" and is pretty accurate at judging if someone is going to have problematic behaviour. For me, I can get people to open up and display behaviours that they don't with other people because I can bring things out of them that are more deeply buried. I will say that this can have disastrous results for people who are actively trying to suppress those parts of themselves.

So, I would say that my character assessments are hit and miss."

I was unemployed and really struggling, my partner was abusive and I couldn't imagine being a child into that environment. I told my mother afterwards because, I guess, I needed support or something. Instead of getting any support, she proceeded to cry hysterically and talk about how upset she was and how much she wanted to be a grandmother. It was pretty hard to hold it together. I felt sad that I couldn't be a mother. It was basically my worst nightmare. I ended up patting her on the back and telling her it was okay.

Guess who's not going to be involved when I do have children? She's done so much more than that, it's part of a larger pattern where she sucks up all the energy and I never get to have something be about me, even when it is about me!"

CPTSD,ffey7vr,t3_et5oku,1579870158.0,"I'm school and have to work at the same time to pay the bills. I think if I was my actual self at work or school, I would probably have a mental breakdown. It's been really difficult to cope and sometimes pretending to be okay around strangers is what keeps me going. It's like I can have some part of my day where I can act out like I am okay and then breakdown at home when I am safe. It sort of feels like have a part-time meltdown. I'm not entirely if it's a good or a bad thing but I think that if I can honour my feelings sometimes, it's probably okay to keep things private at work.

Sometimes, I am not able to avoid being in a bad mood due to being tired and run down. I think everyone feels this way from time to time. I think it may bring on some self judgements. For me, I worry about other people reacting badly to me and maybe abusing me because I'm not being ""nice"". Ultimately, I think it's okay to have a bad day, especially if you're struggling and most people will be able to forgive and forget."
CPTSD,ffexoai,t3_et3k6t,1579869621.0,"Recently I was talking to my partner about a quote that was something like, ""anger is actually expressing extreme optimism"" which to me means that the anger comes from a disconnect between something that happened and what should have happened. I have been most angry when thinking about how my parents should have acted and now feel settled (if not a bit bitter) in accepting that they couldn't have acted differently. They showed me who they were and they weren't very strong or courageous. They didn't take care of me or protect me even though they should have. It doesn't make me angry anymore because I have accepted the reality of their shittiness.

A big part of accepting that reality was letting go of the image I had of the good people that they had inside of them. I separated out their shitty behaviours and thought that if they could just change this or that, things would be different. I realized that their shittiness was equally them. There weren't two sides, just one deeply flawed person.

I don't know if that resonates, but it helped me."
GradSchoolAdvice,f9b5kgy,t3_e46fyu,1575209493.0,"An outline is a great start. Don't think about the whole thing or you will get overwhelmed by the sheer scope of it.

ptsd,f4v5zi8,t3_dlx6wp,1571837126.0,"I get how hard this can be. Congrats on getting a diagnosis and accessing help! That's such a big step. 

For me, learning to access when I was having a trigger was huge. I started to try to name my feelings when I was having them. So, instead of saying ""I am mad about *you* doing x, y, z""...I started to just say, ""I am mad, sad, scared, etc"". Then, we could slowly unpack why that was. By focusing on on my own feelings, I could learn to control them more and became better at realizing what they actually were. Also, by owning them and making it about me, it takes some of the pressure  off of the other person feeling blamed and on guard for doing something wrong. 

Finally, I am often able to say simply ""I'm really triggered right now"" and we can slow down and process that, or I can walk away and take time to calm down. Sometimes, when I am not able to articulate it, I still recognize it and have learned to walk away and go lay down and do some deep breathing. This really helps me to avoid arguments."
selfhelp,f4v4rl4,t3_dljc9t,1571836510.0,"Just to help name what's going on, it sounds a little bit like what they call hypervigilence. It's basically the experience of not being able to let down your guard because in the past when you let down your guard, someone hurt you very badly. It's a coping mechanism to deal with extreme abuse.

I've had some symptoms similar to what you are feeling. Being victimized can make you feel like you stick out like a sore thumb. It can feel like there are threats everywhere. A book that is really helping me to learn about trauma is called ""The Body Keeps the Score"". It breaks it down and helps you understand all the things happening in your brain and also what to do about it.

I hope that our can find some support and peace. Please do try to find some safe people to talk to. You shouldn't have to carry this burden alone."
