Theoretically....

4 and 5 are a better introduction to the series than 1 and 2 because they are stronger movies and that will more likely capture the new viewer‚Äôs interest.

Then before having them see the conclusion of Vader‚Äôs story, go back and watch 1-3 so they can see his backstory and appreciate the conclusion more. 1-3 will also give them backstory on other characters they have seen up to this point.

Then watch R1. This will remind them of who Vader has become after watching the arc he goes through for 1-3. It will also give them backstory on the events they have watched in 4 and 5 so they will appreciate the events of 6 more.

Then have them watch Solo. This will help them appreciate Han‚Äôs story in 6 more, and when they watch 6 he will he even more fresh in their mind for the ST.

Then have them watch 6 to see the payoff of all the events they saw in 4 and 5 plus the payoff for backstory that led to those events. They will have much more appreciation.

Then have them watch 7-9, which will have been set up by 6 which will be fresh in their minds.

Sandwiching 1-3 between 5 and 6 will give you Vader‚Äôs backstory before seeing the conclusion of his story in the final film in the Original Trilogy, which is a nice touch.

Second, I would show the payee the proof you received that her bills are not being paid on time. You could do this by sending this proof electronically, faxing them, or showing them to her payee in person. I will say it would be much harder to meet with her payee in person if it is a hired payee. If you do this electronically or by fax, make sure you get proof that the content was sent successfully (such as a confirmation fax, a successful email in your ‚ÄúSent‚Äù folder, if through text then a screenshot showing the text was ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù or even ‚Äúread‚Äù. Perhaps even turn on read receipts for any electronic means of communication for this purpose, including email.

If the payee still gives you trouble after this, make a visit to the Social Security office to inform them of your concerns so they can investigate. It is better to go in person than to call. If they find that the behavior may be fraudulent, then perhaps involve the authorities, a lawyer, or protective services, whichever ends up being most appropriate.

Considering your mother has a cognition disability, if legal involvement is necessary perhaps there is an organization in your area that provides case management for people like her that could point you in the direction of the best legal options at your disposal for your situation. If money‚Äôs tight, check to see if your local Legal Aid branch handles cases like this, and if they don‚Äôt, perhaps reach out to a local bar association. I know in the county I work in the local bar association provides a ‚ÄúLawyer Referral Service‚Äù where the bar association refers you to a lawyer that fits your needs and going through that service gets you a 30-minute initial consultation for a very low cost, although after that regular rates apply if you decide to continue with that lawyer (however there is a reduced rates program as well). I‚Äôm not sure if your area has anything like that, but it‚Äôs worth looking into and perhaps an organization would know.

The lawyer would probably tell you how to proceed from that point, as well as whether or not you should report this to the police or protective services or both.

Any actual lawyers feel free to correct any errors I have made but I hope this was helpful!

EDIT: Also, if it is a hired payee, it may be worth simply having her payee changed. But I‚Äôd still talk to both a lawyer and a case manager either way.

EDIT2: A few changes."
legaladvice,favedbi,t1_fatrj0u,1576358121.0,"NAL, but this. I work as a case manager and frequently see these types of housing issues. The important thing in situations like these is to get all the documented proof of payment that you can any (legally advisable) way that you can. If the people on the other end of the line of the phone number on the money order say they have proof of who cashed the money orders, request that immediately. Also, get as much in writing as you can. Like another commenter said, text messages are very helpful for documented proof of conversations about transactions and negotiations, and any time you provide proof of payment to the property manager or landlord, ask for receipts from the landlord or property manager. Or if you can get them to say in a text message that they received the payment that can also serve as proof too. Even though I‚Äôm NAL one general rule I‚Äôve learned when dealing with situations like this in my line of work is that‚Äîwith some exceptions‚Äîif it isn‚Äôt documented, it didn‚Äôt happen (not literally but you get my point). Any lawyers feel free to correct any mistakes I have made.

EDIT: Also, one more thing I always recommend to my clients is that ANY housing issue they have they go back and review their lease to see if there is anything relevant to the predicament they are in."

Music,eyoxmwc,t1_eykyeg4,1567285100.0,"I‚Äôm a Tool noob who got into them after they became available for streaming this month and I‚Äôve absolutely fallen in love with their music. I know I‚Äôm not as much of an authority on the band as longtime fans but from the perspective of someone who just 2-3 weeks ago was in your exact position perhaps my input will be helpful. The order I listened was Aenima, Lateralus, 10,000 Days, Undertow, and now the new album Fear Inoculum. I haven‚Äôt listened to the Opiate EP. Before Fear Inoculum‚Äôs release my favorite was Lateralus followed by 10,000 Days, then Aenima, then Undertow. Lateralus and 10,000 Days have a much more progressive rock/metal sound whereas Undertow is more heavy metal and Aenima is somewhere in between imo. Fear Inoculum is probably their least heavy album imo and leans much more hard Prog Rock than heavy metal than any of their other albums. So it really depends on what you like but honestly I loved all their albums except Undertow which I thought was just decent.

I‚Äôd start with Lateralus tho. The song that sold me on them was ‚ÄúThe Patient‚Äù on that album and it was from that album and once I found out the backstory from Genius I was almost in tears."

Music,eym134x,t1_eykx785,1567196859.0,"Yeah on first listen I was kinda disappointed with the album to be honest. I‚Äôm a Tool noob (I heard their music 2-3 weeks ago on Spotify, liked it, checked out more of their stuff, and ended up binging all of their albums and becoming a fan), but it was the first time I‚Äôd ever heard Tool seem repetitive or droning at points.

EDIT: I‚Äôve listened to it a bit more now. My 1st listen was in the car, my 2nd listen was in the car, my 3rd listen was laying on a couch with my eyes closed last night on the back porch with headphones and falling asleep either during ‚ÄúCulling Voices‚Äù or ‚ÄúChocolate Chip Trip‚Äù, and my 4th listen was today on Sonos but I was doing things like cleaning the kitchen and yardwork so my listening was intermittent. But I‚Äôve grown to really like it. Especially last night on my porch when I just shut out everything else and let myself experience it, even though I fell asleep during track 7 or 8. Reading the lyrics on Genius also helped improve my opinion of this album. I think it‚Äôs their gentlest album, which is what caught me off-guard on first listen. But after listening more I grew to appreciate the difference. But sometimes, though not very often, there are points where it drags for me."

rock,ey3fotr,t3_cv97dn,1566763245.0,"This song was so ahead of its time. It‚Äôs an amalgam of two stories. One is from a newspaper article about a 15yo boy named Jeremy Wade Delle from Richardson, TX who shot himself dead in front of his 2nd period English class on 1/8/1991. The other is of a kid named Brian who Eddie Vedder knew in junior high school in San Diego, CA who shot up an oceanography room but didn‚Äôt take his own life. This song was years before Columbine drew national attention to the issue of kids bringing guns into schools so while these scenarios didn‚Äôt necessarily involve others getting killed the song illustrates how young boys/young men will often turn to weaponry as an outlet for their frustrations."
