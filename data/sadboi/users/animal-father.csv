Sometimes awkwardness comes from people trying to force an interaction rather than letting that interaction flow. Don't speak for the sake of speaking or breaking the ""awkwardness"". I consider myself good at small talk and I only talk when I feel like it. Sometimes I'm a talker and sometimes I'm a listener, depends on my mood that day. I don't pressure myself because I know there is no shame in being a person who talks less and listens more. Also, I hate to say it but practice. The more interactions you have the better you get at navigating social interactions. The fact that you notice a problem, seek help, and keep trying is already a huge step in the right direction, you should be proud of yourself."

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190712120244.htm

I agree that the needless exploitation of animals is wrong but alot of people need to exploit animals as a means of survival. I'm not talking about a small amount of people, alot of people on this planet are dirt poor eating mud cakes. You can't escape the competitive part of nature. What I'm saying is alot of people in the world (not the united states) rely upon hunting as their primary food source and they have an arguably smaller carbon foot print than you. They don't get the benefit of a government safety net. Whether you like it or not we can't leave the food chain entirely. This veganism future is a pipe dream for vegan crackpots. Its beautiful in theory but entirely impossible. If some one hunts on their property, should we throw them in jail? How do we know who's eligible to eat meat or not. You say in you ideal word only people who need to eat meat won't be vegans, well there's going to be alot of meat eaters in your world."
changemyview,ev2l052,t1_ev2j8fo,1564178930.0,"Insects are animals, vegans don't eat animals so I'm confused on your principles. Also, alot of cultures eat insects. Who's deciding what animals have value and which ones don't, again the line is really blurry. What about some seafood? Can we hunt invasive species? Can poverty stricken people hunt? You take away the right to harvest the land globally and people are going to starve. Is there going to be a government mandated food program for people who cant afford to be vegan? Veganism is unrealistic. Not every one can shop at Whole Foods. You speaking purely from a wealthy perspective. Although I do believe factory farming is wrong and should be banned, banning the consumption of all meat is unrealistic, selfish, shortsighted, reactionary,  etc.
P.S. I forgot to add that insects have been proven to feel pain and I'm sorry for not citing my sources but If you want you can do a quick qoogle search. So if your against animal suffering and exploitation you should be against killing insects. What's your opinion on the pesticides used to kill all those animals (insects) while farming? Does taking some lives justify saving others?"
changemyview,ev2ij9t,t3_chzyx7,1564177524.0,You made an excellent case against factory farming and I agree with you. You made no such argument against eating meat though. You can still allow an individual to hunt for themself and completely avoid the problems that factory farming brings. Also are we not allowed to eat insects or roadkill I mean it's all real blurry.
