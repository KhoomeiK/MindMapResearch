I don't see any purpose or value in my life. I am tired of this rat race life. I feel like I am just taking up space and a burden to this world. 

All this unnecessary chase behind materialistic stuff, all the ego and formalities just pisses me off. Everything in this world seems so nihilistic.

If only there was an easy way to kill myself, I would surely do it."
