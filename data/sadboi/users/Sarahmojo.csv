 Your insight about willpower resonates big time and is why I feel comfortable at Smart Recovery. I never felt comfortable with 12 step groups. I know it works for many and I dont judge but for me it doesnt. Smart Recovery is new for me so I'm no expert but I like that there is no ""disease model"" It focuses on changing behaviours by changing core beliefs, thoughts and habits. Much along the lines of DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy) 

I've been stuck tapering for a long time at 1.5 mg trying to get down lower so I dont suffer too much. Your post has helped give me a push to jump down and keep pushing to get free of this stuff! I respect that it helps save lives and helps many function to live a stable life and that's great. For myself however  the side effects are debilitating and I dont need it anymore. 

Thank you."

suboxone,fllicoy,t3_fpc8u8,1585260904.0,"So how long have you been on Suboxone? My dr said the longer you're on it, the tougher it is to get off. 

When I first tried to taper after being on it for a month, it was super easy until I got down to 1 mg (from 12 mg). I went back up to 2 mg and stayed on that dose due to my chronic pain. I tried to taper off last fall, so that was 9 months of use and failed (due to complications - sinus infection, severe increase in chronic facial pain). 

I'm attempting a taper the 3rd time now after nearly 16 months of use and it is soooooo much more difficult!!! I was having withdrawal even before I started to taper as my 2 mg dose was no longer working well and instead of increasing the dose, I decided to taper off (and use my new laser unit to treat my pain). I've been on 1.5 mg for the past month and I'm still not stable, still having withdrawal. 

This is definitely the toughest med Ive ever tried to get off. I've been able to get off Tramadol, Hydromorphone and Lyrica in the past on my own. 

I really want to get off it because it makes me sleep way too much and I'm just a complete unproductive, constipated, severely depressed, antisocial zombie on it... oh and zero sex drive. I know it helps lots of people but for me the little bit of pain relief outweighs all the side effects."

I found my depression got really bad after going on subs a year ago. Even the 2 antidepressants doc prescribed werent helping. So I experimented with small doses of Psylocibin. I had tried microdosing for many weeks in the past a few times and noticed no difference but the small doses really did help, I was so surprised and happy about that! My digestion has improved, I'm sleeping less, I dont feel so suicidal and that sense of impending dread/doom. I actually have motivation and get things done!  I still feel dull and blah though amd no sex drive. Not too sure what DMT is but it also sounds promising.

I hear you about family. I have my dysfunctional marriage and 2 teenage kids and both sides of family are either estranged or live really far away and havent made many friends since moving to a new city so the holidays feel a bit lonely though I know I'm blessed to have my kids and my cat!

I will take care of things now. You're no longer welcome here. Go away!""

It's all based on the idea that chronic pain is a result of emotions that are stuck and need to be acknowledged and dealt with to be released and thus be free of the pain. I dont know if I'm explaining it right and perhaps I dont have a good grasp on it. It's considered the new ""Neuroscience"" of how to change and regrow new pain-free neurons in the brain. It's considered by many practitioners to be the answer to the opioid crisis.

I wish I could say it's worked for me but after spending hundreds of dollars on the app and similar workbooks, I'm still in pain.

I too fell for the bullshit that it's no more addictive than coffee. Kratom destroyed my health. At the height of my addiction I was skin and bones (as eating interfered with the effect) and my life revolved around my next dose, even waking in the night to ""toss n wash"". I'm on Subs to get off Kratom! It was impossible to taper for me and I've been able to get off Tramadol and Dilaudid in the past on my own. I had to go to an addiction clinic and Suboxone is what was recommended. It took 12 mg to stop the kratom withdrawals at first!  I take 2 mg for 10 months now as it does help my pain. As I've been trying to taper the Sub, my pain increases and I find myself craving kratom, even after all this time and despite the fact that at the end of my 2 years using it, it had lost it's pain killing effectiveness! 

I have no problem against it being legalized but I do think people should be educated and informed of the addiction potential and bonus would be the product being tested for contaniments. I can only imagine what else is in that green sludge!

r/quittingkratom is actually what led me to Reddit. If anyone doubts what we are saying, have a look there!"
suboxone,f1olz4j,t3_da8z25,1569651022.0,"I was dependent on kratom in high amounts also and it was no longer working but could not taper. I went to an addiction dr that I had seen in the past for a Dilaudid dependency..he sent me to a clinic for advice and suboxone was recommended. I agreed to get inducted and it took a few days to find the right dose which was 12 mg to stop the kratom withdrawal. Over the first month I tapered down to 2 mg as I didnt want to stay on it but it helped my chronic pain which was the reason I took kratom in the first place. I have been on that amount for the past 10 months. 

There are others on here who are on Subs for kratom addiction. Hopefully they post also."
suboxone,f1jcxp4,t1_f1h6lu2,1569521697.0,I see. Another option I've been thinking about is Tyrosine. Or a workout supplement like Fubar which has it for a main ingredient. Those wake you up! Like a bunch of coffees minus the jitters
Psychic,f1fd259,t1_f1fd0kd,1569441855.0,Oops that's PM'd haha
Psychic,f1fd0kd,t3_d965ki,1569441827.0,PM's if you have the time. Thank you
Effexor,f1fcfvr,t1_f1d7bmw,1569441461.0,Yes that is definitely not helping matters! You need a dose every 24 hours due to the half life. Can you not get 37.5 capsules?
suboxone,f1fc65w,t1_f1dw3bm,1569441290.0,"I hear ya! 

Just wanted to add that my excessive sleeping could possibly be compounded by my depression. That's what my dr thinks is a factor. I have severe depression that meds arent treating very well.

I'm not sure it's wise to go off Subs either. I've made a list of Pros and Cons and still unsure. 

One thing I do know for sure through this process is that a low dose is still quite powerful and effective. 

A solution some were discussing in another thread is taking Modafinil for energy during the day. Depending on where you live, you could ask your dr for it or just order it. Something to consider.."
Effexor,f1cmm69,t3_d8s7s1,1569360775.0,"My dr suggested taking beads out of the capsule, so that's what I did for a few weeks, took about half out and gradually stopped that way. I was pretty sick the first week off, dizzy, sweaty, nauseous etc but it got better. I found withdrawal symptoms would hit intermittently and then go..took patience. After about a month of gradually less withdrawal, I felt much better. Except that my depression came back full force and then some, which was the reason I took Effexor. I'm on Prozac and Wellbutrin now which is helping some after a few months. I do not want to take an SNRI ever again!"
suboxone,f1cly1q,t3_d8qtd7,1569360361.0,"I've always slept insane amounts on this for the past 10 months starting at 12 mg then down to 2 mg. Ive been tapering for the past month trying to stop and even taking just 1 mg makes me sleep even longer, 13 to 14 hours. It's like lower doses are even stronger for me. I dont know what the issue is but it's super frustrating! I have to get off this."
unpopularopinion,f0u05ax,t1_f0rr75x,1568931900.0,Agree
suboxone,f06frwj,t1_f05sda0,1568436859.0,Ok done. Btw meant to type sure instead of sir lol
suboxone,f05o3sg,t1_f05lxi3,1568414861.0,So you need a dr's prescription to get Modafinil?
