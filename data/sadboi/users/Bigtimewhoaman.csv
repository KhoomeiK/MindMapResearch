Which - I need to say, isn't his fault - he's the kid. You gotta teach him sustainable human connection tactics. Teach him it's more than okay - and healthy! - to want to be around family & friends. At the moment, it seems like you're not allowing that to yourself - having to ""pay"" for contact with your son.
My dad did this growing up. Only knew how to buy my love. When my folks split, he kept doing it, only then it felt like a bribe to get me on his side, as opposed to my moms. It became hard to trust him after that - given that the only way we ever bonded was - yeah, when he was lonely & needed a pal, he knew he had more money than some teen working at Kroger. 
You seem like a sweet guy, and I can tell there's no ill will here. But you're a dad. You can be honest with your kid - tell him ""hey, I want to hang with my son, let's talk?"" Teach him honesty is manly and cool. Teach him that sometimes, we do things without clear rewards, because being a human in a society demands that. 
 And also - remember, he's your kid first, not your friend. I'm sorry - making a child your friend & peer may seem cool, but has such consequences in the long run. Best wishes."

2) Thank you for putting a recent concern of mine into words! It's so difficult to parse the contents of a brain that's still in panic mode. It can be so hard to trust aspects of yourself - even those you like - when you're unsure why or how you became that way - like, who encouraged me to be like this? Who benefited from my being in this way? Is that... something I like? Or were those traits simply better for others to manipulate me, so I only think of these traits positively because they helped me survive in a toxic environment?

3) Out of curiosity, how do you feel inclined to work on this? For example - my brain keeps telling me that in order to know who I am, I need to isolate myself to rediscover who I am without any outside influence... just immerse myself in things I loved as a kid, and figure out what I \*still\* love about them, and what I can do with that.

badroommates,evu8hof,t1_evu0oyi,1564788366.0,"For clarification:
1) we were never best friends. I agreed to sign a lease with him, and suddenly he decided that we needed to do *everything* together. I humored him for a while, because it seemed harmless & he really doesn't have a lot of friends in the area. But he took my lack of protests as permission to keep taking my time, energy, & resources. That's when I had to draw the line & tell him I never expected to have a... dependent. 
(""Now that we're no longer best friends"" was meant to be /s, thats my bad if that didn't read)
2. We were never ""fine"" with him not paying the extra; its been an issue since we moved in. The talk I mentioned in the original post (""I can't be your best friend...etc"") was one of many things I said to him during the first of our meetups. I had draw a lot of boundaries - including emotional, social, behavioral & financial  - so Girl Roomie & I also brought up the missing $50, but he sort of skirted the issue by refusing to answer us directly about it. This continues to be the case when I mention it later on - a lot of ""we'll see"" and ""I'll have to think about that.""
3) It may seem more responsible to pay early, but the way that our apartment charges us for trash, water, etc. - these charges only show up in the 3 days leading up to the 1st of the month. So he will pay the minimum amount, just enough to rent, and ignore us when we tell him there's additional fees, saying he 'already paid"". So Girl Roomie & I have been paying for trash, water, etc. just between the two of us, and strugling to tell him that he owes us for this.
Hope that answers your questions."
excatholic,euinaai,t1_euhvsp5,1563851337.0,"I think it depends on why people are drawn to the faith. Some people are genuinely kind-natured, and they take it to heart & the doctrine (which..... controversial opinion here..... is Wack) ends up twisting them into uncomfortable shapes. But they suffer through it happily, because that's what you're supposed to do. These are the folks who have that famous ""catholic guilt"" over everything.
Others don't care about that aspect, but merely want the superficial moral superiority, social status/acceptance... these people tend to act however they want, and then bend over backwards explaining how God's actually on their side.

My mom was very similar - she always wanted to be the bigger person, no matter the cost, and encouraged her kids to do the same. 
(Sometimes this was good - I learned how to keep calm in crisis and take care of others, but I also learned that if I was bullied, harassed, assaulted, etc. it was because I hadn't done the most I could to save that person from their sinful desires.)
As a result, I never learned that I had value on my own, I was only good to her if I was as self-sacrificing as she was.
Recently, some close and trusted friends have been questioning some of my other friend choices - they call them ""charity"" friends - and I had to explain that at this point, it like. It causes me severe emotional distress when I see somebody ""hopeless"" (as my mom would say) and I don't try to ""save"" them.
However, I can recognize how harmful this mentality is. My mom has been married to 3 separate abusive assholes, and is still justifying the bullsh*t of the last one. Her life is just...her taking care of others who don't care about her, and it's her rationalizing that ""yeah, it sucks NOW, but it'll be worth it in the afterlife!"". Now, I'm not sure if I believe in an afterlife, but I personally think my loving mother deserves some happiness in this life, too.

raisedbynarcissists,eqmay41,t3_byvk8i,1560159543.0,"Same but different. I'm also trans, but its my dad thats the narc. He thinks I'm just a lesbian, but DOES claim that its ""his fault for that, bc he wasn't around enough so now I feel the need to be the dad he never was"" and actively tries to prove that I have no idea who I am / am making shit up for attention. I had to live with him for a long while.

My best advice is: wear blinders. Yaknow, like horses do? That's how I see it. Folks who aint gonna change for anybody won't care if they hurt you. Therefore: feel no guilt for going gray rock on em. Only give the minimum amount in conversation, emotional investment, etc. Look out for yourself. It sucks, feeling like you're ""holding out love from family"" but in my experience, it hurts a lot more to waste love and energy on folks who don't deserve/appreciate/reciprocate it. 

Honestly, be selfish. Look after your own needs first. You deserve happiness, and nobody should be able to convince you otherwise. Best of luck, friend."
depression,eqm9uxx,t3_byvoy4,1560158959.0,"All the time, yeah. 

What I tend to tell myself to feel better is that - laziness is a choice people make to maximize pleasure. Depression aint a choice, and it feels like shit. 

I can at least trust that I feel like shit doing nothing lol"

egg_irl,eqkkufj,t3_bypuq8,1560125451.0,"I oughta make a ftm version bc SO close to home - My senior prom was in 2014, when I was ""straight"" and ""cis"". 

Still...I NEEDED to go in a tux. Mom utterly lost it, forbade that, wouldn't pay for it, etc. But I had decided this was a hill I was gonna die on. Luckily, I had started working at 15 and had saved up a shit ton of money by then, so I rented a tux on my own. 

I spent prom night at a close friend's - SUCH a good friend, this one. She let me borrow a random dress, took pictures of me all fancy, and sent them to my mom, who was delighted. Then I changed into my tux. My friend's dad helped me put on my cuff links and tie my tie. 

Looking back, it makes sense why I was crying so many happy tears that night lmaoo"

ftm,eqcg623,t1_eqbvvpm,1559968886.0,"I'm glad you found an ID that feels good for you - honestly, I relate to that a lot. Before I realized, oh, pfft, I'm a guy, I strongly identified with umbrella ID of ""queer"". I felt very similar to what you expressed above, then I realized most of my male discomfort has to do with the fact that while women often ""validate my masculinity"", men rarely would - it felt like only women could see who I was, and men were determined to prove that I was wrong about how I saw myself. But I was only able to access that understanding once I became more willing to examine my relation to gender, and exploring NB identities really helped with that.
Thank you so much for your reply! :)"
ftm,eqcfb9a,t1_eqc0lyt,1559968299.0,"You make a really good point - I should probably recognize the narrow confines I'm looking at masculinity with. There's no reason I need to become the *kind* of man I dislike. 
I think that's a really admirable way to think, not at all narcissistic. Thank you so much for sharing :)"
ftm,eqcf5qy,t1_eqc5e91,1559968194.0,"Thank you so much for your response. I think you inadvertently hit the nail on the head - ""Lesbians will see you as a man"". This is a group of people that I've felt very safe with, and I think I'm lowkey terrified of having to relearn where I fit in inside the LGBT community. 
Many girls I've been with have complimented me on my body, and it makes me feel like shit that apparently the body I hate is the only reason women are into me. 
But yeah - being peers with cis dudes? Always super reassuring. Would recommend. 
Thanks again for your response :)"
