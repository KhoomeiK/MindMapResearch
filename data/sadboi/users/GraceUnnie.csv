EatCheapAndVegan,fkp2krf,t3_fjubvc,1584400372.0,"\- 1 tbsp olive oil ($0.16)

\-1 medium onion ($0.42)

\-2 cloves garlic ($0.16)

\-1/2 bag of morning star crumbles ($1.24)

\-2 tbsp flour ($0.02)

\-2 tbsp chili powder ($0.30)

\-15 ounce can tomato sauce ($0.79)

\-15 ounce can diced tomatoes ($0.79)

\-2 15 ounce cans black beans (wanted to use 1 black bean, 1 kidney, but didn't have any kidney beans.) ($1.98)

\-2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni, vegan ofc. ($0.85)

\-2 cups veggie broth ($0.08)

\-2 tbps nutrional yeast ($0.60)

1 cup shredded vegan cheese ($1.00) 

 

* dice the onion and mince the garlic. cook both in a large pot with olive oil over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or until soft and transparent. add the crumbles and stir.
* add the flour and chili powder to the pot and stir to coat the meat. continue to stir and cook the coated crumbles for 1-2 minutes more. the flour and chili powder may coat the bottom of the pot, but that's okay. just be careful to not let it burn.
* drain and rinse the beans. add the beans, tomato sauce, diced tomatos, and nooch to the pot. stir well and dissolve the flour/chili powder mixture from the bottom of the pot.
* add the dry macaroni and two cups of veggie broth to the pot and stir to combine. place a lid on top, turn the heat up to high, and let the pot come to a boil. once it reaches a boil, give it a quick stir to loosen any pasta stuck to the bottom of the pot, replace the lid, and turn the heat down to medium-low. let the pot simmer on medium-low for about 15 minutes, or until the pasta is soft and has absorbed most of the liquid. Stir the pot one or two times during the 15 minutes to loosen any pasta stuck to the bottom.
* once the pasta is fully cooked, turn the heat off and add the cheese. stir the cheese into the pasta until it has melted in and become slightly creamy. serve hot!"

the worst possible stress that can be put on a child, is the responsibility of another child. Im 16F as well, and I lived with my older sister from 11-13, and I pretty much took sole care of her oldest daughter (6-9yrs old) and it put me in so much mental stress it has completely ruined my relationship with my sister and my niece. 

It's good that you told your mother how you feel, so now theres more room for open discussion. It's a very influential and important time of your life that you need to focus on. constantly babysitting another child just shouldn't be anywhere on your agenda."
