Also take your meds, make time to do a few wholesome things  that delight you each day and get ample sleep. Nap over lunch hour if possible. (:

We're rooting for you. You'll be okay."

BPD,f4u2u3j,t1_f4rordv,1571797720.0,"In times like these you need to trust your thoughts less. Think about your mind as a sometimes unreliable and overly protective guardian. It's spewing a lot of un-truths with the intention of keeping you away from what it perceives as potential hurt, but really, as you've mentioned, these thoughts can be ultimately counterproductive.

Create space in your daily life for play, and give yourself permission to enjoy existing."
BPD,f4qzilh,t3_dl8d6q,1571760432.0,"Something I realised recently, is that splitting occurs two-ways with BPD. That means essentially that we can split on ourselves. ""technically defined, splitting is the rigid separation of positive and negative thoughts and feelings about oneself and others; that is, the inability to synthesize these feelings."" But nobody in reality is entirely perfect or hopeless. 

When splitting, we tend to have selective amnesia and only replay the bad (or good) impressions of ourselves and others in our head ad nauseam. It might be useful to make a concerted, conscious effort to remind yourself of your positive deeds and traits.

Besides that, you can also try mindfulness practices to give yourself reprieve from unrelenting thoughts.  [STOP skill](https://bayareadbtcc.com/stop-skill-dbt/) from DBT.

And [CBT](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/dd/84/b0/dd84b065f9072e8cc9ab036154cca572.jpg) to understand the subjective (and therefore non-factual) nature of thoughts and how one can challenge them effectively.

I really hope you feel better soon. (:"

That sense of attachment is really messing with my ability to be myself (the person he likes) and to also enjoy his company.

I suspected that I've lost that inner acceptance of him not being a long term prospect in my life. Reading your posts confirms that.

Thank you."
