EatingDisorders,fp85kny,t3_fz1pyj,1588384092.0,"I am extremely happy for you. This is no small feat. I can still clearly remember the day I reached my 100th day. Iâ€™ll never forget it, because before then I thought recovery wasnâ€™t possible. I fell off the wagon, and my first thought today was that Iâ€™ve had enough and I need to go read something motivational or self help related materials. This is the first group on Reddit that I saw for eating disorders and you were the first post. This gave me a lot of positivity, thank you."
Gastroparesis,fp4jygm,t3_g57nee,1588300701.0,"Iâ€™m astounded that Iâ€™m reading about others who got this after some sickness. I thought I was the only one because my doctors couldnâ€™t figure it out. I got pneumonia that took a toll on my body and it started. It was a very severe pain
Accompanying this I developed nerve damages to all three types of nerves throughout my body. 
Anyone ever read anything that talks about any of this?"
bipolar2,foe7pon,t3_g69bfv,1587697721.0,"No, not everyone does. I do rapid cycle, but after doing a lot of reading some people can go weeks without a mood change or sometimes twice a year."

bipolar2,fmhj1wg,t3_fv7ebd,1586082213.0,For me it puts me in a good mood. The obvious of getting things done and talking a lot. But it activates my hypomania
bipolar2,fmeb42f,t3_fuanfb,1585997108.0,I like that color!!
bipolar2,fl8rti7,t3_fnc7xh,1584930735.0,"I recently in the past few months started to slowly start living alone as my husband and I got a divorce and my roommate went home to her parents until our school started back up
So this virus hasnâ€™t affected me but I know the feeling still. Iâ€™m trying to pick up old habits I liked doing, video games, reading , walking the dogs. 
I recently started to learn how to play the guitar. Music always helps. And repainted my whole houseðŸ˜‚"
bipolar2,fklmeiy,t1_fkjirv3,1584309803.0,I do have an eating disorder. Have had one for eight years now. I just mean as in why it goes through patterns like this. So far isnâ€™t really linked to my moods
bipolar2,fkj8ap7,t1_fkc16lm,1584238821.0,"I feel, but I love your term of candy buddhist ðŸ˜‚"
bipolar2,fjol1ro,t1_fjn06od,1583529900.0,"I think she means she wants to feel good in the moment from those things she used to do. They made her feel terrible but great before that feeling. 
I can relate, but the terrible feeling isnâ€™t worth it in the end"
bipolar2,fjjdrh0,t1_fjhn2sw,1583391703.0,"I miss it too, and I think we always will. Itâ€™s still taking me a while but overtime it gets. Little easier if you do this"
bipolar2,fjft7bl,t3_fd5s5f,1583299606.0,"I completely relate. This has been going on with me for a while and I really just felt like a piece of shit. I was one of those who did everything in high school and thrived. I joined the marine corps and thrived even more until I unfortunately acquired a medical illness on top of my bipolar starting. Now I donâ€™t do shit compared and struggle making goals in like feeling like I have no purpose at the moment. 
We have to realize we are no longer the same person anymore. A friend once told me you have to grieve for the old you and accept the new you and move on. Itâ€™s easier said than done but I think about this everyday and it helps"
bipolar2,fjfsegn,t3_fd34dn,1583298993.0,I wish they had one of these for people who rapidly cycle and it can track the daily mood changes as well. Anyone know if they do have one?
