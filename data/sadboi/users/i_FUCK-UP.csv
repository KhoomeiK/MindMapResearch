You will not be like your mother, because you know what it is like to be abandoned. This might hurt you, but it also made you stronger. From a stranger on the internet."
bipolar,fogxhun,t3_g7b9ox,1587758096.0,"Your lack of motivation to the extra energy and drive that you have may correlate to a bipolar diagnosis. Unfortunately, you still need a specialist to evaluate your symptoms to get the proper treatment for whatever it may be.  I would recommend to take notes on your different patterns. Whether it may be your sleep schedule, motivation, mood, anxiety and stress, irregular thoughts, appetite, etc.,  note them. This will help you once you have the ability to access psychiatric services.

I wish you all the best. And I hope you are doing fine in this crazy time. Take care of yourself. Talk to your friends and family, so you don’t feel too isolated or anxious about your situation. I’m sure they can help you in some way."

bipolar_irl,fg0vdiq,t1_fg0memd,1580415765.0,"Yup! I take olanzapine 10mg, I have a group therapy every week and an individual therapy once every two weeks. The group therapy breaks my isolation and the individual therapy really helps to understand myself and develop new management tools for the illness.  And my advice for you is to never stop your medication, unless it is a bad fit for you and you are having any symptoms."

Have a wonderful day and happy holidays!!

Don’t be scared to make the first move and you really have nothing to lose or regret. If he says no, then it’s a no. But if you don’t ask, you’ll never know. 

Sorry English isn’t my first language."

BipolarReddit,f1nukk8,t3_da70it,1569626747.0,I think you need to ask a professional about this matter. If you feel you have bipolar disorder asked them to evaluate you and to assess your state of mind through therapy. I recommend going to see a psychiatrist that specializes in either mood disorder or psychosis since mania can cause psychosis.
offmychest,f1bbg3a,t3_d8ii94,1569330097.0,I’m so sorry for what happened to you. I think you could get some help in your university. Almost every university has psychologists in campus to help student through difficult times. I want to tell you that you are a strong and brave man who has decided to continue fighting on even with everything you lived through. Keep fighting and get help!!! You can do it !!! I believe in you !!!

And  at 16 around the same time I had a relapse in psychosis. I asked my mother if I could see a psychologist ( we’re Lebanese so my mom beat the shit out of me for asking to get help). At 17, I dragged myself to the hospital and got diagnosed with bipolar 1"
