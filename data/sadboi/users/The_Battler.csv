I imagine my body just got really stressed out the past month or so and is still recovering. So I just do my best to stay positive to help my insides relax.

Anxiety,fpqqbkf,t3_get17x,1588829202.0,"Hey, I'm also 25, also considered myself pretty damn healthy prior to the covid situation. My health anxiety was pretty much this bad for some weeks now too. It really triggered because I had heartburn and a panic attack in the same week about a month ago (due to diet of sodas and hot chips all day till 1am). Anxiety shot up and I started getting symptoms of anxiety that MADE ME THINK I was getting sick.

I was doing the same stuff you were doing, googling symptoms of heart attack/stroke. Don't stress yourself out man. I was. I didn't even care to tell myself that NO ONE in my family has ever had heart disease till about this week. Told my auntie who was a doctor for the army about my situation and she told me I had heartburn but my anxiety made everything I'm feeling a lot more sensible.

Try your best to relax all the time. I let my anxiety get so bad I started getting physical symptoms like fast heartbeat, chest pain, ""feeling"" weird stuff in my body and over-analyzing all of it which just made it worse. Definitely been getting a lot better the past week though because I brought myself back to reality.

Keep up the good vibes. Watch some tv/anime, play your favorite video games, take a nap, take a 15-30 minute walk outside, eat healthy if possible, stretch/excercise once a day, listen&sing&dance to music, and overall just keep the good vibes coming back! You got this!"

When I was having heartburn etc I talked to my aunt who was an army adminstrative doctor. It wasn't till the second/third time I mentioned a real bad anxiety attack (vision fading, arms tingly, heart racing). Then when I told her that she told me the things I was feeling, ""made more sense.""

Just keep up the good vibes as much as possible. Eat healthy if you can, stretch at least once a day, and maybe take a 15-30 minute walk when you can throughout the week.

Looking up how to breathe with my diaphragm helped a lot too because I think I was hyperventilating with chest breathing."

Anxiety,fplmk5q,t3_ge3ztt,1588715427.0,"Same boat, literally before the pandemic I used to think I was like pretty damn healthy. I don't work out a ton, but in high school etc I was pretty healthy. And I was working a physical-ish warehouse job prior to choosing to stay at home 2 months ago. (25 years old now)

Then the pandemic hit, I was on a bad diet of 3-4 Sprite cans a day and Hot Cheetos/Hot chips. Got some bad heartburn then a bad panic attack in the same week, and ever since then my health anxiety has been terrible. I still think I'm having underlying illnesses pop up even though no one in my family has ever had heart attacks or strokes, etc.

Now everything I feel. ""Oh man my arm feels weird"" or ""My neck is sore"" leads to me thinking just wild thoughts lately. Haven't seen a doctor but I think my anxiety caused me to stress out my body a ton to the point I actually have physical pains. Just remain positive, try to eat healthy, and stretch/light exercise at least once a day. Always try to bring yourself back to some good vibes.

I wish I could just go back to being nervous about going to parties LOL. Something I think that really helps me personally is dancing/singing to music. Or watching really good shows.

edit: I'll actually say I did talk to my auntie who was a doctor (not field but administration type) for the army. Basically she told me to relax, change my diet, and a lot of is probably caused by anxiety. When I told her about the panic attack in a second talk, she said ""that makes more sense"""

Donaire's following fights ending with him getting KO'd by Walters were all really enjoyable fights. Donaire is an exciting fighter throughout his entire career.
