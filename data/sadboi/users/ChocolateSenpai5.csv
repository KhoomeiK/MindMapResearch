My childhood best friend asked me out, I said why not? At least he wants to make things offical. 5 days later, my favorite number - my first love died.

The night before he died he asked me to come spend the night but I said no out of respect for my  childhood friend. If I would of came over.....he wouldn't had died.

The night he died my childhood friend and I had sex. He talked me into not using a condom and honestly I didn't care. He ended up cumming in me.

I will write this out and it's going to be about my life. I will not proof read it so I'm sorry if it's unbearable to read but please, try.

My professional life is very well, just got a 2019 Sentra, got a high paying job after GameStop closed it's doors May 18, 2019, I can buy whatever I want - I have an ""endless"" library of video games between my high end gaming PC, Xbox One, PS4, Switch, 3DS, etc.

But, my personal life is in PIECES. Utter fucking pieces, 2018 was such a hard fucking year for me.

At age 5, my dad and mother were arguing about candy that fell in the seats. They both looked down to find it, an older white homeless man was J walking. I saw him, I could of said something but I didn't understand. I had just started watching Dragon Ball Z, I figured the man would stop the car or just fly over it.

He ended up dying. My dad was sent to jail for a year I believe, in that time frame of him being gone my mother started doing drugs. By the time my dad got out of jail it was already too late, but he stayed. Everything, everything went down hill from there.

I was abused, sexually, emotionally, and physically. By both parents, my dad was just hurting from what my mother did. Different men would come in and out of our apartment and if I said something my mother said she'd give me away. I closed my mouth, and my dad beat me for it. ( I just realized saying this, is why I grew up to have a big fucking mouth. That gets me in trouble sometimes, I've learned everything doesn't need to be repeated )

By the time I was 11, a man I considered a step father abused me. His name was Thomas ( This is VERY important ) it ruined me. It's probably the reason I like older men, I have such daddy issues. I don't hate people named Thomas, it's just a name. You don't choose it. I know, but I always keep my distance from people named Thomas because it's just too much of a big trigger. Anyway, fast forward.

I'm 13, I'm alone in a hospital and my parents just walk away. They forgot or got high, I dunno. I ended up going into a foster home, I went in and out of about 4 homes. My final home was a family friend, I met him and his son at the LGBT Center I went to - he saw what was happening and got licensed to take care of me. I thought my life was finally changing, finally. I was going to be loved.

I got there and things were different. Because of my past I was a high risk kid ( I was the EASIEST high risk kid Las Vegas has ever seen. I knew if I acted up no one would want me, so I was ""yes ma'am"" ""yes sir"" ""how can I help you"" ) He got loads of money taking care of me at basically nooo...problem I guess. That word works. But, he introduced us to marijuana and alcohol. I'm pro marijuana, it's the fact of how and why he did it. I was scared of any and all drugs because of my mother, but if I didn't smoke I wasn't part of the family - literally. No allowances, I couldn't sit down when they had family discussions - everything. I had to smoke, thats the part was toxic. After I got ""addicted"" at the time I thought it was fucking AMAZING, but I realize now it was awful. I wasted my summers high out of my mind, at home playing video games. I didn't get my license until I was 22, I wasn't being prepared for the real world - at age 18 the easy money stopped so he kicked me out. He did try to get me into stripping, I made 300 on my first dance and he took 200 of it. So I left, he was just going to use me! He didn't even adopt me like he promised me!

I escaped, I ""lost"" my virginity to a older man - he was actually the father of one of my High School friends. I lived with him for 3 years, my only issue was that our lives were just going in different directions. He has SO many kids but never got the real chance to be a father, the mother of 3 of his kids got fed up when they turned 18 so they all lived with him. He got his chance to be a father and took it, I respect that. His kids stole from us left and right. I was so depressed, I came home from work just to have my shit stolen then he takes it out on me, I thought...what's the point? Since he was older he supplied me with alcohol. I became an alcoholic, I finally admitted this. Wow.

Anyway, he broke with me around my birthday. I was upset but not upset, I was fed up with our relationship for a while but didn't know where to go or what to do. He did help me get my first job, first car, he taught me how to drive, first credit card(s), bank account etc. He taught me everything, I appreciate it.

I was working at GameStop for 3 years, I fell in love. I really fell head over heels for my manager, but. He was a MANAGER, so no knew. I never even told him I loved him, we exchanged gifts and more. I felt happy, I actually felt fucking happy. February 2018 I asked him to be mine, I was going to bartending school. After I completed it I was going to change jobs ( that was the agreement, one of us has to change jobs ) Since we both still worked at Office Depot he said no. I was so mad lol. March 15, 2018 my childhood best friend asked me out. I said SURE! Why fucking not?? March 20th, 2018 - 5 days later. My favorite number, I was informed that my manager had died. I was DESTROYED. That night I slept with my boyfriend and let him came in me, I got pregnant and gave my son my managers name. I can't believe my boyfriend let me. I don't know what I was thinking, I was hoping reincarnation was thing but he's my son sooooo?? I'm a dumbass, I don't fucking think.

It's 2019 now. I had a mental breakdown 3 weeks ago and had a plan to kill myself but my now ex boyfriend called the cops and got me admitted to the hospital. I got out the hospital and thought I was fine, went back to work and even took my son 4 days out of the week. But this past week has been hard. Really hard. When I made this post last night, I was running on no sleep, I had been up  for 24 hours already and was just leaving for an 8 hour shift at work. I tried to close my eyes and all I could think about was dying. I kept saying ""give em the strength"" but I didn't know if it was the strength to end it or to keep going.

I've been watching videos and looking stuff here, I always do that. A new video game I like is coming out, better fucking spoil myself and look up videos, wikia pages and reddit pages. It's the same for anime, I started doing it for suicide....I was really scared but today for some reason I feel better. I  did get some sleep finally, today is my Friday so I can just relax after this shift is over.

&#x200B;

Thank you for listening.

By the way, my manager - my sons name.

It's Thomas."
