I was part of a marketing team for a wildly unscrupulous chiropractic clinic. They were part of a larger chiropractic conglomerate that mandated *very specific* sales scripts for every. single. position in the entire clinic. (I'm sure you can imagine, but the scripts themselves were patronizing and poorly worded essays designed to manipulate people into coming to the clinic.) 

The receptionists all had a script that they were drilled with, marketing ESPECIALLY had a script to follow to the godforsaken letter because we had patient recruitment quotas to follow that increased monthly. Think 100-150 new patients, every single month, in an area where the largest town has a population of 8,000 people. 

The other two marketing specialists had each been there about a month longer than I had, and i know at least one of them had a nervous breakdown in our office from the stress. Our jobs were constantly on the line because of these quotas and script performances. I quit and walked out the day I was told that they were going to fire me by 5 pm over this script hogwash, despite the fact that I had managed to meet their bizarre patient recruitment quota that month.

Last I heard, they went out of business, and how."

What I mean by that is that there are _mild_ quirks or bad habits that some owner trainers are willing to work around, but that a program might wash a dog over. No dog is a perfect machine, but program dogs are a representation of the entire org's professionalism and are therefore held to a very high standard.

I'll preface by saying that I train dogs (narcotics detection) professionally, so my skillset is different than a lot of owner trainers and that's why I feel comfortable working an 'imperfect' dog.

My own working dog had some problems with excitement based reactivity as a teenaged puppy, and still occasionally gets distracted by other dogs in public and winds himself up. That's something that a program might choose to wash him over. However, he's beautifully trained, tasks reliably, and has rock solid PA skills otherwise. He's absolutely not aggressive or disruptive - if I see him getting a little over interested in another dog, I just redirect him and we walk the other way. No big deal, and it isn't a quirk that bothers me personally. I'm confident in my dog and  he does his job well.

On the flip side, I have absolutely washed out dogs over things that others in both the scent detection + service dog industries would tolerate. (Car anxiety and physical clinginess come to mind.)"

The difficult part of that is the fact that some employers can be real fuckin sleazy about their interpretation of an undue hardship. 

There are absolutely work environments that are not appropriate or safe for a SD, however. Depending on your circumstances, that could mean limiting your pool of opportunities to only jobs that are safe for your SD, or working without them.

I've been lucky to have mostly good experiences in regards to reasonable accommodation in the workplace - the most trouble I ever got from an employer was when I was working in marketing for a chiro clinic, and that place was seedy in a lot of other ways. Sometimes you have to advocate for yourself - know your rights, be prepared to provide ADA information to your employer, and for God's sake, *be diplomatic about it.* Most people don't have the first clue about the laws and etiquette regarding service dogs in the workplace.

I have a little sister. She's four years younger than me. When I moved out, she started calling me in the middle of the night, 3 am, screaming for help because things were going belly up at our mom's place. So I'd pack up a baseball bat and go get her. This happened dozens of times in the six months after I moved out for good.

Eventually I just never brought her back there. She lived with me and my partner at the time for two years and it was really good. She was going to school, she was happy, she felt loved and she trusted us. We were a little family.

I left my partner when I was 18. It was more traumatic for my little sister than it was anything. My partner and I always had kind of a good cop/bad cop dynamic in raising the kid. I was always the pragmatic one. She struggled with that, but she had such a good relationship with my partner that he helped smooth it over.

When he wasn't in the picture anymore and it was just me and the kid in the tiny house I moved into, we started having an awful time. I **was not** equipped to be raising a teenager solo. She was growing into an angry, devil-may-care little gal with a lot of friends, and none of them very good. She was sexually assaulted and things really took a turn for the worse. I was drinking a lot at the time, still am, I have a lot of trauma too and I wasn't present enough for her. She didn't want my support half the time anyways, at least not in the way I was giving it. I wanted so badly to give her a space to be a _kid_, you know, like I never had. Some kind of bucolic Full House shit. She didn't want that and pushed back against every effort I made to have any kind of structure and consequences and curfews. She stopped going to school and got violent with me when I tried to wake her up in the morning. She got into drugs and drinking. How could I throw any stones about drinking?

I just want her to turn out better than I have. I regret a lot about how things have gone. In the last year she's decided to move back to our mom's, because there aren't any rules there. (There's also a stark mad alcoholic that can and has stabbed her, but that's beside the point as far as the kid is concerned.) I don't see her very often these days. Her choice. I miss her every single day. I also feel a lot of guilt about how relieved I was once she left.

Can't help but feel like a lot of how her life has gone is my fault. I made a lot of mistakes. I was very young. I wish I could do a lot of things differently - and I know now for sure that I never want kids of my own."

insaneparents,fndyt16,t1_fndnx5x,1586880000.0,"One thing to note is that oftentimes, the alternative for kids in these situations is either few-and-far-between foster homes (they're equally as godawful in their own special way), or outright putting children in juvenile detention centers simply for a lack of anyplace else they can go. 

Source: I lived through the CPS meat grinder as an at-risk teen. I've also worked in juvenile corrections, and encountered plenty of what they call ""CHIPS"" cases - kids who haven't done fuckall wrong, except for having no safe place to go."

survivorsofabuse,fn9tos7,t3_g0f535,1586784297.0,"So. When I was a teenager and first figuring out sexuality, I had a VERY similar dilemma. I thought I was 100% As Gay As They Come, because not only was I not attracted to men (and penises), but I was outright repulsed by them. Had a downright aversion. Not so with women. See where this is going? As I got a little older (15-16?) I started having mild, ignorable crushes on dudes while I was chasing other girls like no tomorrow. At that point though, I was so invested in lesbianism being my identity that I wasn't willing to acknowledge any feelings contrary to that.

I did end up meeting a dude that I connected with emotionally, and - if you'll excuse a minute of crassness - after a while of me experimenting with penetration with no Player 2, I realized that a lot of my aversion to men was trauma. It was a very new thing to contend with. I had pigeonholed myself into a particular sexuality so aggressively that I was _ashamed_ to find out I might be something else. But I loved that person, and so I came to terms with my new generic Queer™ title, and nowadays I know that i am equally into men as I am women. I'm happily dating a man, but I will still proverbially drag my tongue after ladies in my free time.

Your mileage may vary. Give yourself time, experiment, **relax.** Don't brand yourself with one designation before you're sure, like I did - there is no harm in avoiding labels for your sexuality. Do what makes you happy (literally.)"

AskReddit,fmwhc0a,t3_fxjqxa,1586446590.0,"I was the student in this scenario, so please account for my firsthand bias -

I had a severe self mutilation problem as a teenager. This went pretty far beyond the cat scratch phase that many teens go through nowadays, I was routinely hitting muscle and arteries. (To this day I have significant nerve damage in my limbs and I am head to toe covered in purple inch-thick scars.) For a short time before I was committed, I was slashing myself up in school bathrooms whenever being around people got to be too much for me - I was leaving behind massive blood puddles on the bathroom floor, bandage wrappers, it was downright disgusting in hindsight but that's what mental illness will do to you. I remember specifically that there was almost a school lockdown because they thought someone had been fucking murdered in the bathrooms. Nope. Just good ole /u/Endermiss, skinning herself again.

I feel awful for the guidance counselors who had to deal with me during that."
service_dogsofReddit,fmwdcmy,t1_fmwcg0g,1586444510.0,"She is not a service dog unless she's trained to perform **specific tasks** to mitigate a **diagnosed disability.** As far as I know, BPD is not a disability, and I don't know of any place where emotional support is grounds for public access. _Your dog is not a service dog unless she's performing a specific, trained task to mitigate a disability,_ AND you have a doctor who has prescribed a service dog for your medical needs.

Please reconsider putting a vest on your pet and trying to pass her off as a service dog. Real SDs go through years of training for the privilege of working for their handlers in public, and you are discrediting the hard work of real teams by slapping a vest on your pet and confusing the rights she has as an ESA vs an actual service dog."

servicedogs,fmw9mw1,t1_fmr0o2i,1586442427.0,"Yes. I have a GSD trained for PTSD assistance. He absolutely feeds off of my anxiety if I let it get too far out of hand - working with Cyrus means helping myself so that he can help me. I have to be mindful of my body language when I'm on edge, and my own threshold for when I just can't function in public even with his help.

For me personally, there's a silver lining in being forced to manage my symptoms so that the dog to be confident in working - I'm not as dependent on my SD as I could be otherwise, because part of our team dynamic is me managing my own shit for his sake, and just looking to him for the extra support. (For context, my dog is trained mainly for blocking maneuvers and DPT flashback intervention.) 

Overall, I probably wouldn't recommend a GSD for everyone, and I would stick with the usual recommendations of standard poodles and Goldeen retrievers. I don't know that I personally will opt for anything but a GSD once Cyrus retires, but I'm also a professional trainer outside of service training and I'm coming to the table with a different skillset for handling."

Thanks to a fucking metric ton of trauma, I tend to think my only value is in sexual availability, and I spent a long time thinking that my appeal was in being a free-for-all, up for anything doormat of a woman. Turns out, that just makes you feel like shit. We're all just trying to feel wanted. Hang in there."
