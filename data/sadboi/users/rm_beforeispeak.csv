PublicSpeaking,fqbj1dy,t3_g51p3j,1589237896.0,"The only thing I didn't see here yet...which is EXTREMELY important is to focus on your breathing. 
Many times your nervousness/jitters/fluttery voice will accelerate from not taking slow....even...deep breaths while you are speaking. 
This is also an excellent way to take your mind away from 'thinking about being nervous'.
One technique is to inhale...count to 4, exhale...count to 4 (wash/rinse/repeat). And YES, you can do this while speaking. 
After a while, you wont think about breathing and you wont think about being nervous either..you will be in rhythm. 
Correct breathing will also improve your voice quality while speaking. 

Hope that helps.

PublicSpeaking,fksot6c,t3_fjdr1s,1584494939.0,"Best advice...focus on your breathing. 
Breath slowly and deeply. 
When you breath in, count to 3, exhale, count to 3, inhale. 
It sounds crazy but yes, you can do this easily while talking and strangely it takes your mind completely away from worrying about what people are thinking and focuses you on just delivering your presentation. After the first minute or so, you might even forget you are doing it."
