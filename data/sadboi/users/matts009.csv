I just bought the Keystep a couple weeks ago and have only had a couple hours on it. So far its sequencer has been nice; with the ability to send a sequence over one MIDI channel while using its Keyboard Play mode to send notes to another channel. So I could construct a bassline with my sequence, while I play a lead in Keyboard Mode, etc.

Looking forward to messing with its Arp and Chord modes, too."

4. Korg Minilogue XD Module
5. Arturia KeyStep

All bought in the last few months. Just starting out, and trying to learn the ropes of Ableton and subtractive synthesis. Having a lot of fun so far.

Next up / debating on, once I can get a handle on things...

1. Drum machine / sequencer (really liking what I've seen of Digitakt)
2. FM Synth
3. Another midi controller w/ pads / sliders
4. Push 2 (way off into the future)"

I am sure the other riders doing these distances are a mix of both competitive and casual - I'm more on the casual side, I just want to do the distance.

Yes there should be rest stops according to the event details ([Turkey Roll Bicycle Rally](https://www.discoverdenton.com/original-event/turkey-roll-bicycle-rally/) in Denton TX)"
bicycling,f75rsj0,t1_f724gh9,1573418427.0,"Thanks for your reply.

1. There is a 52 mile route and a 68 mile route. I am going to try for the 52 mile - I may do 68 depending on how I feel.
2. This [RideWithGPS](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/28915254) route shows it to be about a 1k foot elevation spread throughout. All of my rides are flat.
3. It's the [2018 Turkey Roll Bicycle Rally](https://www.discoverdenton.com/original-event/turkey-roll-bicycle-rally/), it doesn't appear to be a race.
4. It looks like there are rest stops. I am sure I will stop there, but I figured I would bring enough water and pack enough snacks.

I guess I am wondering how I should prepare food-wise. I'll eat pasta the night before to maximize my glycogen stores. Just not sure how to approach the morning-of and how I should spread out eating while I am on the bike."
