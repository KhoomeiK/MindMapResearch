Bow drills are very easy and primitive to make, and learning how to make one could save your life if you one day become stranded. Too many people think they will always have a lighter, flint and steel, or matches on them, but what happens when you are in a dire situation when you don‚Äôt have those? You have to be prepared to work with what you have. Fire goes a long way in terms of survival.

link to the first video I watched that went in depth with the details of how to make it, and mastered the art of bow drill making: https://youtu.be/mi3tqw_wYmg"
