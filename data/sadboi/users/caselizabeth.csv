BPD,fqtnj70,t3_gkjhyq,1589642437.0,"I know exactly what you mean.. When I say things like ""I don't want to be here anymore"", It's not that I want to die, I just desperately want to escape my own head."
BPD,fqpytit,t1_fqpy2en,1589556446.0,"Currently in the process of saving money so I can get the hell out of here, but unfortunately I don't live in a very affordable area so it's been a struggle. I have no doubt that our relationship will improve and thrive once we aren't in each other's faces everyday, because we used to have such an amazing, close bond. I also have a four year old son, and I don't want him to continue to grow up in such a hostile environment."
BPD,fqprlg2,t3_gk36az,1589552660.0,"YES.. This is such a big struggle for me. I live with my mother who happens to be my biggest trigger, and even the smallest negative comment will send me into full blown rage. She's the type that HAS to have the last word, so she will drag out an argument as long as possible, pushing me more and more until I snap. I'm aware that my reactions aren't appropriate, but it's like she knows exactly what buttons to press to push me over the edge. I've tried multiple times to explain to her that I NEED to be alone when I feel myself getting angry, or else things will escalate, but she's too stubborn to listen.."
BPD,fqpr2kd,t3_gk59f8,1589552375.0,"Not every new person, but when I'm romantically interested in someone I get attached super quickly. It's something I've tried really hard to be more aware of ever since I left my abusive ex a few years ago. I can't let ""love"" take precedence over my well being."

He was very soft spoken and seemed a little anxious, but he was really sweet about pictures and autographs, and he laughed when I made a comment about how tall he was. Matt was suuuuper friendly and we had a whole conversation with him before the show."

I'm fairly certain he and Britini broke up at the beginning of this year. She posted a picture on Instagram in early March with the caption ""Thank u, next"" and deleted all traces of Tilian from her page. 

He was posting pictures of Mika to his Instagram story around the time of Swanfest, so it seems like they've been dating since then. I'm guessing they met very soon after the break up... or she was the reason for the break upüò¨"
