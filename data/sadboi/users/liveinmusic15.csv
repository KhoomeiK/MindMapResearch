electricdaisycarnival,fhf8feh,t3_f2wluf,1581538322.0,"I went to EDCLV for the first time last year in 2019. It was my second time going to any festival so I didn't quite get it yet. Sure the music was cool and the lights were nice, but it just hadn't clicked yet.

I've had depression for almost as long as I can remember. After a some time you just start to think that this is how your life will be. You go day-to-day just being sad and not understanding why. I took a chance buying this ticket during a spontaneous moment with no money and no plan on how to get there. Somehow I managed to make it work.

Fast forward to day 3, about 1:30am. Zed's Dead just finished their set at Circuit Grounds. The fireworks starts and everyone was staring in amazement. The energy in the crowd felt so different than before. Everyone knew that this was their last chance to leave it all on the grounds. Illenium starts and through the excitement of seeing my future favorite artist for the first time, I finally got it. I understood why people live for these festivals. In that moment, I realized that I was so happy. This was something that I could hold on to. This feeling exists and it's out there. If I keep hanging on and pushing through the hard times, then I can keep making new memories of these incredible moments."

Frugal,fejzy5j,t3_epgeg4,1579189642.0,i bought the most basic $10 room sized space heater from walmart - maybe Mainstays brand or Sunbeam (not 100% sure).

declutter,fdntth9,t3_elyzvd,1578592698.0,"another option is to keep it for a bit and sell the game that you tried and hated. I'd say to look into game rentals. You could try redbox for a couple nights or use another service. That way you can give the game a few hours to try it out and then if you love you can purchase it. You'd save a lot of money by not buying games that you end up hating. Also when you find games you love only buy used or on sale. Give yourself a hard limit - like I won't spent more than $40 on a game.

&#x200B;

But if you don't think it's worth the time or money then I'd say just resell it."
