Blizzard,fpvkm22,t3_gfpfyh,1588946684.0,"So after the debacle that was No Man's Lie in 2016, the developers from Hello Games realized that making any statement becomes a promise according to the media. They went back and began adding many of the features they had once said the game would have, and though it's not perfect, it's leaps and bounds ahead of what it used to be.

So that's what an indie studio can do, given the funding and time, to turn around an otherwise doomed product.

Activision Blizzard is a multibillion dollar AAA studio with over 20 years of added experience, and over 9200 worldwide employees. If they're unable to turn around and fix a product that already had it's concept development and story done, even at a 40hr/week per employee schedule minimum (expect some people to work more, some less, some are developers, some aren't, so make this the average, at least in the US) with the ability to have as many developers and artists as they can reasonably toss at the product, then this will continue to prove the many frustrations we have all come to believe about Blizzard for years now.

At this point, it's hit or miss on any product with the ""it's finished when it's finished"" mantra studio. Activision seems like poison."

Advice,flnf824,t3_fpn3lz,1585317269.0,"I had a coworker who wasn't hugely into controller based gaming and found PC was much easier. He was 70 and had a good amount of free time he spent playing games like World of Warcraft. 

I always recommend the ""classic"" version of World of Warcraft since it introduces new players to the simplest form of the game. It can launch you into a beautiful world of quests and adventure where you choose where to stop and go. Plus, with the ""classic"" version being released 15+ years ago, there is guides all over the internet if you want help or get stuck on something. I find the ""classic"" version is much easier too to pick up, and I even have a couple people in my group of players that are 55+ and do the max-level content with me, sometimes outperforming most of our younger folks! Ah and that's another thing, you'll have the opportunity to meet a lot of people playing the game, since it's what's called an MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game).

You also wouldn't need to buy a gaming console since you can play the game on your computer. And, the nice thing about the ""classic"" version is that since the graphics are the same as they were 15 years ago, any modern computer can play it with ease.

Something else to note. If you ever want to try the modern day version of the game, they bundle the game together for the same price. It's membership based, which can be a turn-off to some, but I think $15 a month is well spent for the amount of hours you can really put into the game. I think they allow trial accounts too, so you should be able to give it a try before buying. It's on Blizzard Entertainments website. Give it a shot and if you have any questions, feel free to ask me! I've been playing this game in particular for 13 years."

It depends on time invested vs gold earned. 50g, even 41g, like the other poster said, is still worth spending the 10-15 minutes to find a buyer. Something else to note, this works better when you're on when other people are too. Trying to find strat live runs for orbs, even on Mankrik-US at 8am takes forever.

classicwow,fi0agq2,t1_fhywn9w,1582031860.0,"Same here. I joined my guild for their first raid and have been at every raid ever since. We use a MS>OS rolls system (which has benefits and drawbacks, and some of our ""veteran wow players"" say they'll leave if we go DKP/LC because it didn't work before). The three warrior tanks and loot master sat down in disc one day and we discussed how we wanted to fairly go about considering giving mitigation gear to our deep Prot tank if he'll use it a lot more, and the two fury prot tanks (myself and our MT) being allowed to roll (not prio) on threat pieces. I've made it a goal of mine to get as many blues or BOE's as I can to avoid stepping on our warriors toes, and I rolled an Orc so I had the good opportunity to get the axe from AV rep and OH from UD Strat. We also have very few dagger rogues so our MT went dagger and got the OH from DM West and a Gutgore Ripper that all our dagger rogues had. We're locked out of rolling on Band of Accuria, which although it is a great piece, I'm fine with since Don Julio and a tarnished elven ring will get the job done. I'm 3 arcanite bars away from getting my LH helm and have been getting some help from guildies in the form of DM E jump runs.

Moral of the story is, there's ways that make it fair for everyone. Our MT and I have been really enjoying fury prot because it's just a more fun variation of warrior than deep Prot to us. Our GM, Officers, and Loot Master (who I should mention is a mage and has been playing private servers for years like I have) know the items that would be better off on certain classes and get easily replaced by others. They created a loot rules doc that pretty much explains the handful of items that have priorities for certain classes, but not one of those is prioritized towards tanks, which I am 100% fine with. I don't see our loot system changing soon, but our guild environment is that which takes care of one another. Like you, I'm our guild blacksmith so they funneled a lot of cores into my rep with thorium brotherhood. At the end of the day, it's the laughs and fun we're all having that make up for the silly purple pixels people tend to worry too much about nowadays."

Its gotten to the point where I want to actually see a physical coach in the form of a personal trainer actually like your reference, but this mental block literally will not let me. It's frustrating. But thank you, this helped a lot."
Advice,ff5sn4s,t1_ff53er6,1579608717.0,"Excellent. Thankfully I do have insurance provided by my work which should help financially, but I'm never one to concern myself with money. I want to feel like this person can help me figure out myself, and that I know I can trust them.

Any suggestions as to what questions I could specifically ask in my situation? Some more context, I'm a 23 yr old guy with a good paying job for my age and I put up a mental barrier to protect myself because I don't know how to deal with them, and my only vice is playing video games to distract myself from loneliness, depression, anxiety, etc.

Thank you, this helped."

I know you can't judge a whiskey or wine by the first sip, so it may take some time to get the vibe I'm looking for like you suggested.  Is there any tips you have about questions I can ask or things I should be looking for in a therapist?

Either way, thank you, this helped."

When asked how long he'd been doing it, he said ""only about the first year or so""."
