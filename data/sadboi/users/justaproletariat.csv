I wasn't brought up religious but just the knowledge made me feel better, being able to fully go into the fear and explore it instead of trying to block it out has been empowering. 

Death doesn't seem so ominous, now I think of it as in relation to one of many theories. It's not the great taboo once you study it. 

I've read into different religious texts, spiritual texts and philosophies and their interpretations on death.
Some of the spiritual ideas have stayed with me and my fear is nowhere near as bad as it was :)

There's alot of literature to explore on the difficulty in proving such things as the existence of anyone other than the self under the heading of solipsism. You are certainly not alone there. I go in and out of feeling that way too.

I'm wondering if the idea of constant transformation could be felt as a positive rather than negative? Spiritualists would see this as opportunity for growth, rebirth, new beginnings. The idea that there is no constant self is common in spirituality but I've only seen it written of in positive lights. I feel this one also, but the new self seems to emerge every few months rather than as rapidly as you describe, making it hard to ever relate to my former self or past. I have trouble convincing myself they are the same Being sometimes...

I can say though that it seems many realize how short life is at much later stages/ages, regretfully. And so have much less time for reflection, realization, remembering not to take things for granted etc
I know it's no solution to the main problem, but if there's any positive this early realization could be used to make the absolute best of life, rather than letting it fade past without ever fully realising fully the preciousness of being alive and existing, as I feel those who do not consider death, cannot consider life either
Though brought up atheist, I have found reading books on different perspectives on death and afterlife in various religions, philosophies, cultures and spiritual practices gives me some comfort
I have taken to some of the spiritual perspectives which I never would have expected

Please don't let other people's insecurities and blatant jealousy manifest into suffering for yourself. They may have too experienced our shitty society model for all that it is and are taking their frustration out on others. You do not deserve that but the negative comments are most definitely not an actual reflection of your work being poor.

In a time when so many people are feeling ripples of unemployment, austerity, recession, it would be very harsh to see yourself as having failed. 

You are talented. People would buy into this.

I'm sorry for your struggle. Life is simply not fair. Society and government are deeply flawed and this effects our personal lives and dreams. But income and the indecency of few are not things anyone of us should die for. You're so valuable and true talent will always be found in time.

It's the second time now that this has happened with someone I have dated but I still couldn't see it for what it really was. At the time those emotions that feel like deep love feel so intense and real though that I don't understand how we can ever distinguish them from reality until clarity finds us. How can I stop myself before it is too late when I'm so consumed at that time by the false feelings. I find myself oversharing with these people as though we are soul mates and its embarrassing to consider it's not reciprocated in reality and is likely rather alarming for them. 

How did you actually reach the reality that it was the BPD? For me I have to go through the horrific period of hysterical sorrow until I eventually emerge and realise it was just a scenario that I romanticised alot to the point I couldn't see clearly, lost myself and idolised someone who I shouldn't have and feel rather embarrassed and regretful. Unfortunately I find the initial manic feelings that come with this toxic type of love quite addictive, so I worry that I subconsciously seek them again and again, choosing to ignore the inevitable pain which I know is to follow.

Oh and fully get you on the PTSD thing. It's so traumatic, particularly when this clouded judgement leads you to people who are not so kind and take advantage of your vulnerability. I've found a few abusive partners this way."

Sometimes it feels a curse to consider such things and I envy those who can be blissfully unaware of these existential concerns as it is hard to enjoy life when they become too consuming, however at other times I value being aware and pondering such things as the search for truth feels meaningful. All I have concluded so far that I can absolutely confirm as being of any value is caring for and loving others in this lifetime, particularly the vulnerable and marginalised. It just feels right and when I have days where I feel this way, like giving up on life or faith, the drive to help others suffering pulls me back in. I think compassion and empathy may lead us closer to these ultimate truths we desire, even if we still feel blind and confused. And even if we do not find all the answers we wished for, at least we will be doing good for one another in our time here.

I did eventually overdose quite badly on H, and I remember clearly my vision going black very quickly, and for the first time in years I realized I didn't actually want to go. I had a moment of dread, regret, fear and panic but it was too late and everything went dark and my breathing stopped. I desperately didn't want it to be happening. I was so surprised and lucky to have woken up from this experience and it made me realise that although things may not be perfect, I think we don't assess the finality of death so much when we are suffering and struggling. Further from this, my drug use went on for quite a few years, and now after a very long journey of trying to find purpose, I have eventually found new reasons to live for in helping others through care work, but now regret deeply the irreversible damage mentally and physically I have done to myself through drug use. I wish I could go back to the moments I felt the way you describe and take it all back, and instead fight rather than destroy myself so I could have the fully able self I once was rather than this deteriorated version that can't think sharply and clearly. I hope you can find purpose, because you mean something in this world, and though you are suffering there are ways you can bring love to yourself and those around you, stranger or close one's, in this short time on this earth. Your struggle makes you unique and introspective and interesting. You can see the bigger picture, that there are things wrong in this world that need yo change. Many are not capable of this. This can lead to creativity (art, poetry?), a great ability to empathise with others, and a deep insightful mind. Many great people in history have had times of deep sorrow. Please don't go yet.

When I feel unwell I feel that my body is a separate entity from me that is alienand against me, as though it has its own agenda. This happens when I am feeling particularly in a deep psychosis. Do you exercise? I binge eat when I forget to exercise but hunger levels out when I am active"
thanatophobia,fntyh7w,t3_g3w53z,1587251018.0,"I think in many circumstances we die in hospitals under certain drugs. Do you think in such instances the process is eased by this? I spend a lot of time thinking about this too. I have overdosed before and everything just went black before I even had time to comprehend it, and ever since I have just expected that dying will feel like that. Its things like cancer that scare me more so as the emotional stress of the anticipation and the potential prolonged periods of pain would be rough. But again there are medical drugs used to ease this process too.."
SuicideWatch,fntxhug,t3_g3sz2y,1587250485.0,"Please think of the countless people you have helped in your life and work so far by being such an empathetic person who was kind enough to choose a career path that meant you could dedicate your life to the most important thing we can do in our lives, which is to help others. You have displiyated both empathy, courage and dedication in your decisions and actions. 
This virus is an act of nature which we are all victims of and is not in our complete control. All we can do is our best. We are all guessing what the right thing is to do. Many of us are feeling lost and confused in this time. You have tried to do what you thought was the right thing by others, while attempting to deal with your own personal life problems too.
You are an inspiration and you deserve better times to come to you in the future. I hope you can learn to love yourself again, because you are so worthy of it."
BPD,fntlhil,t1_fnt4sie,1587244049.0,"So true, particularly relate to the acting out part. The amount of shame and guilt that follows after realising you have had an episide of acting out makes it so much harder to pull yourself back together again. If BPD was less stigmatised and misunderstood perhaps it wouldn't feel so much that people are resenting you for things outside of your control. Why must this already difficult illness be made so much harder than it already is. Just a bit of empathy and support is craved so much sometimes."
