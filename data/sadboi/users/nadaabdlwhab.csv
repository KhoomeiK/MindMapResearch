Advice,f1r7all,t3_dafuz2,1569712089.0,"Well I’m sorry to tell you that most of “Arab parents” are like that they will make your life miserable. But growing up I understand they sometimes exaggerates because they’re scared. 

So try talking, maybe she will listen, tell her that you hate being forced like that and you would be carful or let her drop you off to ur friend’s house so she would feel that you’re safe. 

Good luck man I totally understand how you feel"

depression,f1mbonn,t3_d9swuk,1569590071.0,"I wish one day you can accept and forget whatever keeping you from feeling good about yourself! It’s like you’re stuck in some “moments” of your life and can’t get out and move on. Which sounds crazy when you think about it that way. 

Literally EVERY SINGLE ONE of us 
I mean in this entire world have messed up or did cringy things but who cares people forget anyway, time will make you forget anything just do your best and stop reminding yourself. 

My advice to you is whenever these thoughts come distract yourself with anything. When I lay down at night and dark thoughts start to building up I open my phone read some posts here or watch my favorite tv show until I fall asleep honestly it helped me so I hope it can help you too if you decide to give it a try and remember we all have felt the same way you’re feeling. Take care❤️"
fatpeoplestories,f1ma2mx,t3_d9qu8w,1569588845.0,No you’re totally normal to feel that way I would be so angry too if anyone treated me like this. Be confident we all go through wight changes and that’s okay it doesn’t matter be comfortable and work hard because you want to not because of anyone. Love youu😘

Advice,f1j2f8n,t1_f1j0iwv,1569517853.0,"Yes, to make a long story short it has something to do with my parents their “relationship” is not good I always have anxiety when I’m around them BOTH! I’m afraid it will happen there, another reason is I don’t want to see my ex-best friend we ended our friendship last week. I feel  so much pressure just thinking about it and I have decided to end this anxiety by not attending the whole thing! But I’m afraid I will regret it later on and am afraid of how my friends will react and all the lies I have to tell them this day."
