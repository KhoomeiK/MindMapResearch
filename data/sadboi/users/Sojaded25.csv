BPD,f9nhqiv,t3_e5zdyl,1575484727.0,"I use music to drown things out. I listen to a lot of dubstep, riddim, metal, punk stuff. It’s always been away to not feel. I don’t take any meds even tho I should. I ghosted my therapist and I’ve fallen in a really bad pit in desperately trying to get out of. I use music festivals as a coping mechanism I guess."
SuicideWatch,f9nbth2,t3_e5tfi6,1575481275.0,"Yes. It hurts. I can’t fill the void. I can’t feel. I can’t feel a goddamn thing anymore. I feel like I fucked up my whole life anyways that people would expect me to kill myself anyways. If I listened to my mom more, if I never met so and so, if I coped better. I got my first tattoo before I ever touched a drug and I lost my virginity to a guy I met for five minutes at a Halloween party freshman year. I hate who I am. No passion. No drive. I work and I “sleep to avoid”. The only thing I look forward to are trips with my friends and festivals. I never imagined I would live to be 25. Life doesn’t even feel real anymore. I’m starting to think nothing is real anymore."
