My mom, maternal aunt, maternal grandma, and others have all had major thyroid problems, so I’m worried that it’s just going to get worse from here.

TTC30,fr2ifbf,t3_glucdy,1589837838.0,"Anyone have experience with thyroid issues? 

I got bloodwork done with Modern Fertility and saw my TSH was in the ""normal"" range, but higher than it should be for a pregnant woman (their range for normal in 1st trimester is 0.26-2.66 ;my TSH tested at 3.3). So while my TSH is normal for a non-pregnant person, it would be high if I were to get pregnant. 

I asked my doc and she said, let's get do more thyroid tests. I didn't ask which. Turns out I got my T3 tested. The normal range started at 80, and my t3 tested at 78. 

I got a call from the nurse today asking for the original labs from Modern Fertility. I sent them. The doctor then said everything is normal and no need to do more. 

I am confused about this, since she knew from the beginning my results were in the ""normal"" range. I would think with higher TSH and lower T3 - especially given my TSH is up about 1.2 points since the last time I got it checked in 2018 - would indicate something may be going on with my thyroid. 

My concern is I may need medication to conceive. Has anyone else been in a situation like this? Do you think I should talk to a different doctor?"

The last two months, we have not had sex during my fertile window because he wasn't in the mood. This month, he was nauseous for a few days and, as a result, didn't feel like having sex again during my window.

I am feeling very frustrated by this as you might imagine. He asked me what was wrong yesterday and I told him I am upset that we keep missing the window. I tried to be conscientious about my phrasing, but he is really hurt.

He told me today he's worried about us. That he thinks he won't be able to give me what I want, that I won't be happy. I told him our relationship isn't defined by sex and that it will get better. But he is really shook, and I kind of am too.

This sucks on another level apart from trying to conceive. Not having my needs met makes me feel incredibly alone and unwanted.

I know starvation mode is a myth, but looking at my numbers, I'm wondering if I'm eating too few calories? It seemed when I was eating around 1600-1700 cals I was losing more than I am now in the 1500ish range. 

[Here's my weight and cals eaten data for he last 3.5 weeks.](https://i.imgur.com/wXYsFLM.png?1)

More info: 

I am a 31F. SW 150 / CW 145 / GW 125. I have been working out consistently since 3/17, meaning I have not taken more than one consecutive day off since 3/17. 

When I workout I am doing between 30 - 60 mins of exercise, avg heart rate between 130 - 180 depending on the workout. In the beginning I was doing mostly cardio, around the second week I started doing heavier weights and backing away from cardio. I'd say my workout routine the last two weeks has been 80% weight training (which def has sneaky cardio) and 20% straight cardio. 

I weigh/measure everything I eat. I was eating low carb the past two weeks and recently shifted to a high protein diet to allow for a more well-rounded diet. CICO has been the priority regardless of the macro goals. 

Am I over-analyzing here? Should I be eating more? Or just be more patient?"
AskWomen,fqipv65,t3_gil16z,1589399266.0,"A former principal of mine was incapable of leading a poor and failing school. We were afraid to come to him. He was unpredictable and unprofessional. We (the teachers) knew that if anything was going to get done, it would be because of us, not him. 

Last year, district was laying people off. My megalomaniac boss intervened district office’s plans to lay me off because I was successfully leading one of his pet projects. 

It got real awkward when I had to tell him to his face, after signing my contract, that I got a job with a different district and would be leaving. 

He actually acted like a decent human, and nothing negative came from it. My husband, who I met at that job, still works there and never experienced any backlash either.

nutrition,fpl5dch,t3_gdy8h6,1588706661.0,"Before quarantine, I was easily eating over 100 grams of sugar a day on average. Since March 17,  I have been really focused on eating better, and found a few things that helped: 

\-More Protein/fat: When I focus on eating more protein/fat and less carbs, I crave less sugar. I feel full after I eat and I don't want to keep eating. I don't do keto, but I do limit my carbs; I eat \~100 a day. Probably important to say that I did some research as to how much protein and fat I personally should be eating in a day, but that isn't hard to do or track. 

\-Sparkling Water: I drink about 4 or 5 sparkling waters a day, which is kinda expensive - but, I stopped drinking alcohol, so sparkling water is my go-to instead. I think the fact that I literally don't drink a single calorie (100% sugar for me - alc., lattes, soda), along with the fact that I'm not drinking alcohol (aka liquid sugar) all the time has made my cravings weaken. Plus, I think it actually tastes *really* good, so it feels like a treat to me (like candy would). I know that sounds insane - I used to laugh at people who said shit like this  - but it's true. 

Last thing, I just have a damn piece of chocolate if I have been thinking about it for a while. However, I find myself wanting it and thinking about it less and less over time. That's what's surprised me the most - on most days, I don't miss it. 

Hope this helps somebody! I have been stalking this sub since I made my lifestyle change and there's been so much good advice :)"

sugarfree,forp7y7,t3_g949fc,1588016083.0,"I didn't necessarily mean to end up on a similar journey but I sorta ended up this way too. I stopped drinking - mostly - I have had a planned glass of wine on my birthday but other than that nothing. I was a heavy drinker before. Then, I decided I wanted to get healthier and started cutting back on sugar. I'm doing a modified keto now and have really cut back on added sugar - I think I've had two pieces of candy in the last two weeks, which is HUGE for me, who would eat the equivalent of a minimum 5 mini reese's cups a day.

I considered quitting caffeine and weed, but I'm not sure it's necessary for me. This whole path has made me really assess why I do what I do. If the reasons are healthy, I don't see a problem continuing to do it. For me, drinking and stress eating were behaviors that came from an unhealthy place. When I think of my morning coffee or an afternoon smoke break, it just seems more like a part of my day than something I'm doing to distract me, so I don't think it's necessary to quit. Admittedly, I don't *want* to quit either - but I don't really see anything wrong with it for me.

WeightLossAdvice,fojpvd1,t3_g7pgss,1587826829.0,"I have had men say similar things to me (You'd look amazing if you lost 10 pounds). It's as if they think they're complimenting us? I'm really sorry you experienced that, as I know how deep comments like that stick with you. 

That being said, since quarantine I have gotten really involved in learning how to be healthy rather than just lose weight. I have found when I spite diet (fuck that guy, I'm gonna look amazing!), it doesn't work because

1. I am not doing it for myself, I'm doing it for someone else, which means 
2. As soon as I let go of that anger, I find I don't care as much about what I eat, and I go back to what I was doing before.
3. Cycle repeats. I get exponentially more mad and frustrated with myself and my body. 

**This is why if you want to lose weight, you have to do it for yourself.** You have to love yourself so much that other people's words don't matter. That is a tall order, but that is the only thing that will make it so ignorant comments like that don't hurt, and your journey is sustainable. If you approach yourself and your body from a place of love and respect, the journey will feel more doable and worthy of your time and energy. Do it because you love yourself and want your body to be as healthy as it can be, not because some MFer made an ignorant comment. 

So, to answer your question about not hating yourself anymore... that is one of those things only you can answer. But it starts with defining your own self worth, and not letting others define it for you. Not easy, but necessary. 

To answer your question about working out and not getting anywhere: I have always tried to out exercise my diet, and the more I learn, the more I have realized (as I have read so many times but didn't want to believe) *you can't out-exercise a poor diet*. 

The single thing that has helped me the most is tracking what I eat. I resisted the idea for a long time, but the more I read and the more I track, the more I see that it really is the biggest help - at least for me. I didn't realize how many calories those mini reese's cups added, or even how many calories I was eating a day. I wanted to believe that if I ate healthy, whole foods, I didn't need to track, and the occasional piece of candy wouldn't matter.

**While that is true, without tracking, you will have no idea where you're at in terms of calories out vs. calories in, which is how weight is lost.** Before, I didn't know my total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) or if I was eating more or less calories than what my body needed. Now, I can see my TDEE is approximately 1700 calories, and I aim to eat between 1300 - 1400 calories a day. As long as I am eating at a deficit, weight loss is guaranteed. 

Essentially, without tracking, you are at best going in blind, at worst setting yourself up to fail, because you are likely consuming more calories than you are burning/using. Use My Fitness Pal or Lifesum (I use Lifesum but a lot of people seem to really like MFP) to track your daily calorie intake. 

Hope this helps, OP. Remember, first and foremost, love yourself. <3"

Been ttc since November, but only started tracking in March. Last month my (31F)  husband (41M) didn't want to have sex on the day of my LH peak. His testosterone levels are normal, but he just can't get aroused sometimes.

Now the same thing is happening this month. I believe my LH peaked today and actually woke up wanting to have sex anyway. So, this afternoon I playfully suggested it and he said ""I just don't feel like it today"", to which I said we should try later at some point.

It became clear at that point the conversation was really bumming him out. He confessed he is feeling very insecure about his masculinity, and he worries I am going to cheat on him because my needs aren't being fulfilled. It became a discussion where I needed to console him and make him feel better about it, but I am really upset that we aren't able to have sex today.

I can't have this conversation with him because it will only make him feel worse, I am so damn frustrated. This is now two months in a row that we will have missed LH peak day. I know all hope is not lost, there's a window, it just sucks knowing we could be having sex and we aren't.

Not to mention, *I do* want to have sex regardless, and it's very difficult to accept his lack of sex drive has nothing to do with me.  I'm feeling really sorry for myself. I wish there was something I could do to make this different.

I don't want to incite a power struggle. I'm thinking maybe a note of some sort may be more effective since it's silent. At least I am addressing it in the moment that way. 

I have a unique opportunity where they are required to conference with me, so I will definitely take this conversational approach when I meet with them later this week (provided there isn't something else that happens where I am forced to deal with this sooner).

So the beginning of the conversation is actually easy, it's just referring to the syllabus and what is stated as reasons to lose points. 

I get the sense that they will attempt to fight back and / or gaslight me into thinking that's not what actually happened, at which point all I can really say is ""I know what happened and  if you are worried about earning these points moving forward listen more closely to directions and have a more open mind about what we do in class"".

This is my 7th year teaching and it has always been hard for me to not take things personally, but I do think I care more about some kids' opinions than others. I guess it's that I don't understand, so I ruminate over what it could possibly be that's making them be this way. 

I will say, just typing this reply alone has made me realize my feelings about them are not about them at all - but about me needing to be validated as a good teacher by them.

teaching,f2d4daf,t1_f28u7fy,1570146954.0,Have heard of this. Thank you for reminding me!
teaching,f2d4bil,t1_f291emw,1570146933.0,Thank you!!!
teaching,f28sk32,t1_f28r8bj,1570069625.0,"I definitely agree with that. I’m taking issue with my colleagues’ abrasiveness and inability to acknowledge that it is important to instill a value of timeliness. Not just because it’s an important life skill, but because I can’t properly assess and decide how to proceed with instruction if I don’t have the whole picture. More than anything, I just want to see actual research on this issue rather than personal philosophies."
teaching,f28ofoi,t1_f28o603,1570066703.0,The teacher is very confused about what equity means. The comment was made after she accused another teacher of not caring about kids because he deducts late points.
teaching,f28o52t,t3_dcffu7,1570066489.0,We call them guest teachers.  Kids know that means a sub.
teaching,f28nfre,t3_dcjtq6,1570065987.0,"That’s tough.

Is there a counselor or social worker who could intervene? 

Call home? 

It’d take some balls, but possibly even talking to the kids one on one? Something like “I wanted you to have this, (give deodorant), could you please wear it when you come to my class?"
