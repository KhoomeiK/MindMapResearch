If it's a fabric with no direction, you need to check the width of the bolt and measure from there. Will you have a separate fabric for the belly?

>Posting on Facebook, or elsewhere is probably not a great idea. A few years back I did that, and was met with resounding silence. That deeply fucked with my head, and I spiralled, horribly. Social media is not the best place to ""reach out"" for love and support. People do not go to FB, or IG to see depressing stuff. They go there to kill time while they are shitting, in waiting rooms, or watch TV.

>Instead, reach out personaly to your friends and family. You will get much healthier responses. Tell them you are struggling, and you are getting medical help, but that you could really use thier support, even if it's just as a friendly ear.

When you are outside of supervision, but so deeply exhausted that you can't get out of your bed with out your knees buckling and your hands shaking so hard you can't open a door, it's very difficult to walk yourself to a high bridge.

There is also a very real point where a person has tried literally *all* of what is medically possible to get better. What do they do then? Call their friends and family who are sick of hearing it, and don't pick up the phone? Post in one of the ""feel good"" subs here asking for a kind word and receive ""I'd fuck you"" DMs? Call a hotline and end up with the police to coming take them to a hospital against their well?

15 year-olds, people who have lost their jobs, postpartum sufferers, people experiencing the loss of a loved one, people in the LGBTQ+ community and other minorities, people who lose their home, etc, these people we can help, yes, absolutely.

When you're living with a permanent physical or mental illness, all you can do is try and stack the scales ""reasons to live"" side with more things than the ""please just let me not wake up"" side, and honestly I can't figure out how to do that. I feel like the math is against me. And why am I alone responsible for this? When people have lost limbs, cancers, etc, our country steps up.
