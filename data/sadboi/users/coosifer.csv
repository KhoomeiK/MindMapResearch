detrans,fg0gyio,t1_ffzjiao,1580407588.0,Just came across like.... of course you’d say that to a woman now that she identifies as a woman. Just wanted to call that out it’s all good!

detrans,ffzdt8m,t1_ffzb44f,1580374032.0,Is this supposed to be ironic
shittytattoos,ffdvvh5,t3_eswers,1579830218.0,I know the artist that did this and they’re amazing!! Just because you don’t like something doesn’t make it bad
stopdrinking,fepsqda,t1_feoufrz,1579329988.0,Lol I’m on the exact same timeline as you and I relapsed on a trip too in September :/. It’s so much harder to get sober this time
BPD,fdks6b4,t1_fdk74fu,1578510039.0,Alcohol and weed mostly ? Those are the most significant
BPD,fdh7x90,t3_ekxy7p,1578417311.0,You explained it perfectly :/
oakland,fcp3bhw,t1_fcory5d,1577849178.0,Is this a real thing?!?
BPD,fawq05w,t1_fawp65v,1576374126.0,Honestly I thought that I was over that and it wouldn’t happen because I had taken time for myself and didn’t date but holy shit it only took a month this time before I couldn’t stand them. At first they’re just this angel and then I’ve picked them apart so heavily in my head that I can’t find them attractive anymore.
BPD,fawow0v,t1_favkvaw,1576373821.0,And they’re just so confused
BPD,fawouv7,t1_favkvaw,1576373808.0,I relate so so so hard with this. It’s so fucking sad seeing it happen over and over and they all have the same look on their faces.
depression,fafied5,t3_e8wf5e,1576023517.0,Happy birthday—I feel like I’m on the verge of losing my friends because I just can’t get out of it and always just end up comparing myself. Thanks for making me feel less alone in that. It’s hard to resonate but when you do it really means a lot
depression,f8aofel,t1_f89ptf3,1574404294.0,I feel you. It takes time and before we actually get close to someone we cycle through our depression and we haven’t bonded enough to make it last
depression,f7b1c8l,t1_f7arfd6,1573550253.0,I’m here if you need to talk. Was sober for 2 1/2 years and relapsed a couple of months ago..not doing the best I ever have but absolutely not the worst even in my sobriety. I know the feeling of shame and regret. Hit me up
depression,f7b0uvo,t1_f7acvtp,1573549486.0,Please just know that it is not based in reality and our brains are so so powerful and sooo good at making us hate ourselves. When we feel off and not intuitive and not ourselves just know this isn’t your fault or anything that you’re doing to make you feel this way. Sure there are things that can make you feel better but don’t beat yourself up if you can’t do those things. Give yourself a break for the next couple of days and know this will pass. You’re sweet and real and a good person. Don’t let this bullshit ass illness tell you different.
depression,f7b0raq,t3_dv37ic,1573549329.0,Are you female and on your period?? I’ve just finally fucking realized that two weeks out of the month (week before period and period week) I’m fucking so depressed. It’s helped a lot knowing that it will pass. Took 22 years to realize
PCOS,f7b0hiu,t1_f0b5nhf,1573548909.0,Thank you ❤️

PCOS,f0bj33h,t3_d4c8h3,1568527718.0,Thank you so much
BPD,exukr49,t3_cugay8,1566584956.0,I see this as god doing for you what you couldn’t do for yourself. Breaking up was not an option for you before praying and I think there was a moment of grace where you allowed the break up to happen without fighting and hitting your head against the same wall over and over again. This is a chance to heal whereas you wouldn’t be able to if he were around. I know it may not feel like it but this is probably the best thing that could have happened to you right now

asktransgender,eq1ssot,t3_bwtzqf,1559718275.0,I went to middle school with her! She hadn’t come out yet and I totally had no idea. It’s crazy because she has a twin brother
depression,eowhswt,t1_eowhbgd,1558910002.0,"True. I Don’t think it’s fair to use humans as props to make us feel better and safe. I know it’s good to fantasize about this situation but in reality you just have a stranger with no emotional connection in your bed not talking, while also feeling like a burden. The only way this would actually feel safe is if you felt emotionally connected with this person, in which case would end up pretty toxic since you’re just using them for comfort and emotionally stability. Get a dog if you want cuddles and unconditional love."
depression,eow94z1,t3_btdjjv,1558906682.0,Get a dog
