I think the background is excellent and it's a very well framed shot. I would definitely recommend a shorter exposure for the ground lights and do a composite so the background and long exposure lines get the attention they deserve. But not too dim, I think they need some brightness. You may be able to successfully tone them down to just be less demanding."
