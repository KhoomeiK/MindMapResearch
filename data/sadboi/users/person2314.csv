That is developed because if you are like that in a social group you are more likely to have a mate if you are the superior one(a lot of the time you if you make it there have a quality that is needed for survival) .The people who aren't assholes developed from the ancestors that mate with the ones who are also less in the group. Hence the socail diversity in humans.
misanthropy,fqub5s7,t1_fqsx6h1,1589655556.0,Dolphins also brutally murder young porpoises without the intent of eating them. They also gang rape female dolphins. So I believe anything with a brain can be peices of shit. Its not humans it is intelligence and social structure. Just us humans are  just more complex. So that leads to more impactful shittary. Remember it took us hundreds of thousands of years to properly rate war before then it was just one group of humans trying to not die from whatever so they attacked another group. Nowadays there are a few flukes of people that have the right genetics to not have the compassion we do have (hence why disabled people and people with brain defects still are around.) That use humans and all the fancy things that were made to make our lives easier like planes(although they were made way better by war and such they originated outa 2 brothers in a garage) like the telegram that was made because his wife fell ill and by the time he found out and got back she had died. He wanted a faster way to communicate over long distances so noone else would have to have that happen to them. Just because war and greed accelerates something doesn't mean that it was bad in origin.
