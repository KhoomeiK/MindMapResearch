When i had my first episode, of mania, I ended up losing all my friends and I was also a drug addict.

So when I went home, my parents could not handle me right away, I was kicked out, so I had live on the streets for a short time till they took me back in.

In my brief time living on the streets, I realised how unfair the world was, how there are some people who eat 7 course meals and throw half of it away while others live in poverty.

I realised then I wanted to change this, so when I was finally taken back home I changed my stream and took economics, I started studying, I struggled along the way but I had a purpose now.

To remove wealth inequality and make the world a better place.

It takes alot of effort and some medication, but we can be normal, not to suck my own dick but I've achieved things it takes people ten years to do by the time I'm 20, and still in college.

This was only possible cause I didn't kill myself I came close but I didn't do it, I stuck it out, addiction, meds therepy I endured all of it for two years.

1. The friendship died, I didn't text them they didn't text me its dead over most of them went this way. Close friends too, or so I thought and now I haven't spoken to them in years.
2. Some of them didn't text me right away but did after a while and acted like nothing happened and made plans and we hung out and it was chill.
Here's what I realised, most people are too pussy to just tell a person they don't wanna talk so they'll continue replying like everything is great that doesn't mean they're your true friends.
And secondly we suffering from bpd think friends alot closer to us than they actually are, those who texted me wanted a relationship in which we meet in few months and don't talk everyday which is fine.

You gotta stop texting people, you'll find out who your true friends are, worst case scenario you are left alone, which is better than being in fake friendships atleast to me."

relationships,ewalold,t1_ewaljvg,1565246375.0,"That's what I thought first, but there's so much history, five years of friendship, I just wanna be sure that cutting ties with her is the best, thing to do."
relationships,ewalgtp,t1_ewalbgz,1565246236.0,"Well the ex in the story she dated him while she had feelings for me, and she kept telling for months that she wasn't with him while my friends told me they were a thing, so she's lied about it before.
So I'm more inclined to go with what her friend said."
relationships,ewal7ku,t1_ewakwgj,1565246069.0,"I left out some details, but my friendship with her was conditional, that she stay honest with me, I was actually in love with her and I just don't have it in me to talk to her when I know she's with someone else, so I asked her very specifically to tell me when she's dating so that I can step back.

And the guy she's dating is her best friend, of nine years, this is the most important relationship shes every been in and she hid it from me for a month.
Edit: spelling mistake"
