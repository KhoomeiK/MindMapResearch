fasting,fibgw0q,t3_f7gppl,1582321683.0,"Please don‚Äôt. Combined with your negative self talk - this might put you at an increased risk of developing disordered eating behaviors. Learn healthy eating habits & eat whole foods. Develop a good, healthy relationship with food. Join a team or just be more active in general.

If that didn‚Äôt work - here is a more scientific approach!

It‚Äôs been well established that fasting lowers levels of IGF-1, which plays an important role in growth. Higher levels are needed by anyone that is still growing. All this to say,given our current knowledge, fasting could stunt your growth. Dr Fung, a world expert on intermittent fasting, advises that teenagers do not fast. You are still actively growing. 

Wishing you the best!"

I would lie about where I was going/if I was busy and go to the gym. This is not normal. Eating disorders will make you do illogical things.
