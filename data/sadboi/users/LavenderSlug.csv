Then the calls started coming in. The rehab he worked for started calling me several times a day, even after I told them I wasn't interested.

I get what you mean about the nice feeling. I definitely got a huge adrenaline rush, especially knowing I probably would've died had I not stood up in the last second. 

I would really advise against trying this again, OP. I'm not going to guilt you with the ""your family would be sad"" bit (nor is this the subreddit for that) but what helps prevent me from trying this method again is the potential consequences if I fail.
