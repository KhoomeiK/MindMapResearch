Anxiety,fpzk4f3,t1_fpxyajt,1589019359.0,"I just want to say that it’s definitely not too late! 

I am not in the exactly same situation, because I am a male, but I had the exact same fears when I was in my early twenties. I did not approach any women because I was afraid they would laugh at me, because I am so clueless. I thought you had to be “smooth”, and I was too late for me to learn that. 

But please, do not think that it’s the case (I know - easier said than done). 

I found online dating the easiest because 1) it doesn’t require you to go out and have already establish connections with peers 2) all the participants sort of understand what is going on. So if you are messaging someone on the dating app they know that you are interested. I think that’s very good because it doesn’t require previous experience with talking to people about those kinds of things.

I understand that as a woman you have anxieties about violence from online dating, but honestly depending on where you live I don’t think it really warrants that. 
Of course, I am not a woman so maybe it’s easier for me to say that. 

I wish the best of luck to you and to the OP. Please stay strong!"

ContraPoints,fid7tth,t3_f7nqkg,1582363733.0,"Hi

I think the “catgirl” image is a bit of generalization, I think Natalie just used it as a shorthand for those trans people who are really into anime and cutespeak (uwu). 

I think the reason why there are so many queer and trans people into anime culture is because it is fundamentally an outsider geek culture that had a lot of impact on the internet. If you are a geeky person and you feel like an outsider for many reasons then you can find home and friends on the internet by participating in this.

Catgirls are not furries, as other commentators have explained. 

As for internet leftism - well, younger people are already more left wing than gen X, and people often use internet for self-radicalization.
