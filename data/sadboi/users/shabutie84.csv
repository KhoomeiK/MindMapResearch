offmychest,fqpmidy,t3_ghksmh,1589549786.0,"I just need to vent. About 6 years ago my husband and I got laid off from our jobs. We worked at the same place. I decided that staying in the manufacturing industry was not a good idea and decided to go to school. I got an associates in Business and since then I have worked so hard to get myself to a place where I wouldn't have to stress about keeping my job. That thought mentality was a lie. But we have fought through and struggled and were on the path to being at stable jobs for 2 years. A year and a half ago, my nephew (he's married to my niece) we will call him Rob got my husband an interview at a company and he got the job! We were ecstatic as this was a huge deal for him. My husband thought he had a good relationship with his boss Larry. He got a few contracts paid for by the factory he worked for totaling over 100K. Larry constantly told my husband what a huge help he has been and that his sales have paid his salary for the year a few times over. This was all done in January and Feb. as the beginning of the year was crucial for the company to secure contracts and get them paid for. Then the pandemic happened...

My husband was FIRED. He was hired by a software tech company and he was doing IT work for a factory near us. Factory closed temporarily due to COVID, he was working at main office creating manuals and helping wherever he was needed by the robotic company. His boss told him to ""make himself useful"". Well I got sick, I had to take two weeks off to quarantine, I have a doctor's note. When his boss, call him Larry found out I was sick, he told my husband to stay home since his father was in the office daily and was high risk and would contact him with work and let him know when to come back. So it was like the 15th day, he didn't hear from anyone, he assumed they didn't have any work for him which is not unusual since this is not uncommon. This company is family owned and they are branched off into two different sectors, one is working with software and IT, the other is building robots and fixing them. Larry's brother, owner of robot part of business I'll call him Tom calls my husband and tell him that he has been off work for over 20 days receiving pay and has not shown up to work or produced a doctor note to excuse his time off. He then tells him not to call Larry and bother him as he's busy and my husband is worthless. He says Larry has told him that he comes in whenever he wants and takes way too many days off and is not reliable. Tells him that if he continued to keep employees on his payroll like him his family would go hungry. Mind you, according to his brother Larry, the contracts that were secured by my husband were enough to pay his yearly salary a few times over. My husband tried to tell him that he has a note and can provide it but he needs somewhere for them to fax or email it to as the clinic is not allowing people to come into the office. He says ""You're not talking your way out of this and I don't want that note"". Tells him he is fired. We applied for unemployment, they are fighting it...here's where things just get stupider....

My nephew Rob is young, in his early 20s. My nephew Rob and niece live in a city an hour and a half away from the factory where he works. We moved 20 minutes away from his job so my husband could have an easy commute. Rob would not come into the factory until whenever he felt like it. He took about 4 weeks off in December because a distant relative of ours was sick and they went to Texas to visit with the family. He calls out constantly because my niece is ""sick"". Basically all the things Tom accused my husband of doing. So here we are...

I wish I could feel ok with the fact that my husband lost his job. Normally I would be like, it happens and we move on. This time it just felt so shitty, like it wasn't enough they let him go but they had to make him feel like a piece of shit and accuse him of being a shitty employee.

We've yet to hear from my nephew...my husband and him were close, he hasn't even gotten an ""I'm sorry you got let go"" or even like ""hey let's play some games"" or do something to get his mind off the fact that he got fired.

I know we're going to be ok and we will move on, as we've done before. I just wish I wasn't so angry."

This is the first year I‚Äôve been able to cope with this.

I‚Äôve just accepted him for who he is and how he deals with things. I love him, he means the world to me, so I am giving him space.
