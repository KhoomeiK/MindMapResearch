AskHR,fee0i04,t3_eod9gg,1579023814.0,I should say the reason im asking is because ive been asked for feedback on the interview and im not sure if i should ignore it or say something.
glasgow,fcp0bp4,t1_ez0az8f,1577846591.0,"I really dont think that is allowed if im honest. I was in the gambling industry for nearly 10 years and the gambling commission takes things like problem gambling, underage gamblers etc very seriously. You cannot be forced into gambling if anything we where trained to protect the vulnerable and look for indications of gambling addiction. Id personally write to gamcare or the commission itself to say this company is using these type of tactics. The whole industry's a mess but that is complete misconduct."
glasgow,fcozq5r,t1_fcoam4y,1577846097.0,"Thank you! Ive actually done rather well and have quite a lot of interviews lined up with decent companies, should have seen the email i got from this one though, knew straight away it was off. Preying on desperate people looks like! Should be ashamed of themselves !"

cheating_stories,f682jue,t3_dfn9z3,1572724989.0,"Yep, about 7 years ago my partner got close to a ex of his, i say ex but they went with each other for a week when they where teenagers, he sat me down and told me he didnt love me anymore and he wanted to be with her, i went fucking crazy and demanded to know every detail before he left. He said nothing had happened physically and he was telling me before he wanted to move on with her. I was crushed. And angry. Very very angry. So i did what any angry chick would do, i fucking messaged her and called her out, she then told me she isnt interested in him he is just a friend and that she is currently seeing someone else. I was like what the fuck? Flash forward a few days and he turns up at the door saying he was sorry and he made a mistake. I told him hes only saying that because he was rejected by her and im no ones second choice. So it turns out that when we hit a bad patch (and it was bad) he was talking to her, and she was feeding him bullshit (told him her ex husband was abusive, she had kidney failure and was on dialysis, she could never have children etc) she basically took advantage when he wasnt clear on our future and then made everything 100x worse (shes never liked me either says im a ""twisted cow"" fair enough) I am still convinced something happened between them but they both deny it to the hills. She also was sleeping with multiple men while trying to string mine along and ended up pregnant surprise surprise. I later found out from a co worker that her parents had cut her off and she was on some twisted mission to get pregnant so the bank of mum and dad would support her again. From this whole situation i learned 2 things 1. If your partner is genuinley unhappy anything will turn their head and 2. Bitches be crazy. We now have a solid relationship, we where young at the time with alot of responsibility on our shoulders. But i had the evidence and to this day its denied. Suppose ill never really know what happened. Id still happily run the bitch over tho. 🙄"

gambling,f4349e7,t3_dbus7o,1571338307.0,I worked in the gambling industry for 10 years and loved it. My best win though was £2000 i won on a both teams to score football coupon around 6 years ago. Never had luck like it again.
