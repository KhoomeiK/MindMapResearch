When I would try to talk to him about how the stress and hating my job was literally crushing my soul he would get emotionally abusive that I wasn‚Äôt supporting his dream and I should just look for a better job where people respect my work. Easier said than done when you‚Äôre the only person making an income, holding the health insurance, and paying all the bills, right? 

Obviously all this time, I was in a very depressed, low low place with anxiety through the roof. About a year ago I started seeing a therapist and a psych NP. It has been life changing. I learned about his manipulative behavior and how to set boundaries with him and stand up for myself. I also started medication that has really helped control my anxiety and depression. I‚Äôm still suffering but finally seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. After almost 4 years now, his business still hasn‚Äôt gotten off the ground.

I‚Äôve been going back and forth between NP school and PA school. I like NP as that‚Äôs what I was initially set on, but am very drawn to PA as it seems like PAs are more likely to get to be hands on or able to get into more specialties.

That being said, I honestly like I hear people‚Äôs personal experience on how they decided their path, what their background was in beforehand, their current position/specialty and how they got into that specialty.

For reference, I‚Äôm a 30 yr old with a Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology and ended up teaching PE.
