The fact that I can feel period cramps more on one side than the other and my fiancé and I have been trying a little bit with no luck, is exactly why I’m asking strangers for advice. I’m sorry."

amipregnant,ey98sta,t3_cw9kfo,1566937794.0,"WOW. Thank you ladies for the fast response. I feel way more at ease now that I can vent. Even if I am or not, I’m really thankful for this community that allows me to express myself and not be judged."
amipregnant,ey98du0,t1_ey96vwx,1566937529.0,"I’m trying girl but I can’t help it. I really do want a baby, but I’m guessing the anxiety is coming from not knowing if I can have kids or not."
amipregnant,ey98a42,t1_ey97txo,1566937463.0,Hmmm I may go grab one....
amipregnant,ey9888l,t1_ey977yw,1566937430.0,I know this isn’t accurate but I counted back 14 days from my expected period (my period does mainly fall on the expected day) and it fell on the 17th which was another day we had sex with no withdrawal 🤦🏾‍♀️ so really I’m just stuck in the waiting game
amipregnant,ey97p7q,t1_ey97gt9,1566937093.0,Wow so First Response is more accurate??
amipregnant,ey9708l,t1_ey96s4y,1566936651.0,I have a clear blue digital test at home that tests up to 5 days before a missed period. Is that okay? Or should I try first response. I’ve been using the clearblue manual tests for the last two days.
amipregnant,ey96dts,t1_ey9641k,1566936249.0,I thought a test was only 100% accurate when you missed your period? A lot of women I have read get BFN days before they miss their period and then get a BFP. I guess it just depends on the person.
amipregnant,ey95fb3,t3_cw9kfo,1566935641.0,It has been two weeks since we had unprotected sex with no withdrawal.
shrooms,ewqjftk,t1_ewqhge7,1565667741.0,"I’m 21 and a daily smoker lol. Oh well.
My mom hasn’t had issues at all with schizophrenia, but then again she doesn’t smoke. I’m hoping it will just skip me too, it’s only been two incidents where I heard my voice outside of my body 1. was off a small hit of DMT and 2. Was when I was smoking on the couch one day and heard a firm voice in my head so “put the blunt down”"

I just smoke joints now."

zoloft,etu0k05,t1_etty9oi,1563201225.0,Oh wow. This post made me tear up at work. Thinking of myself as my own best friend just helped me within a split second to call myself beautiful. Thank you for this. You have no idea

zoloft,etsks75,t1_etsk6my,1563148226.0,"I guess I’m trying to get over the “black stigma” of depression. In my community, just until recent years it was not talked about. Even with my family personally, I didn’t start talking about my depression until my first semester BEFORE college (I guess my thoughts threw me into a full panic attack). Should I stop smoking weed before I start dosing?"
shrooms,epeog6a,t1_epekyk8,1559185126.0,"Oh no you perceived that in the wrong way I’m sorry. He is very open to my decisions, trust me he’s not that type of guy. He would definitely not let me take them when I tell about the new information I learned, hell he may reconsider taking it his damn self. But I honestly feel like it would be great for him since he has mild ptsd and can’t express his emotions well. He has been through a lot in his childhood. He’s been searching for answers and I feel like he deserves them. I just hope I can convince him to do it by himself."

shrooms,epei7ba,t1_epefqf9,1559183012.0,"I told my psychiatrist that I smoked and she’s only against it because it’s not legal in TN. So I don’t even think should would be comfortable with a conversation talking about psychedelics, lol. Though she is young.  So you think zoloft is good to start with atleast? I want to try the micro-dosing, but maybe I’ll start when things I start quieting down in my life right now. I’m in a good place mentally lately so I think I’m just going to stick to that for now. How long can I keep them until they “expire”?"
