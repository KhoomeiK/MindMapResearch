LifeProTips,fpjmeua,t1_fpjavur,1588673946.0,"In Canada, we have labor laws that stipulate these kinds of things. For example, there are generally two kinds of terminations - With Cause, and Without Cause. With Cause means you've stolen something or committed an act (usually multiple depends on severity) violating employee conduct clauses and are deserving of termination. For smaller things, you need to do this multiple times and HR needs to prove they tried to work with you to fix the problem before terminating you, while for larger or more egregious situations a single event may suffice. Paperwork / documentation must exist. The ex-employee can sue and labor laws are heavily pro-employee to protect them, so the burden of proof is on companies to ensure they have followed the labor laws (or else big financial punishment). My understanding is that most times (if not all) if you are fired with cause, you cannot quality for unemployment insurance.... Could be wrong though.

Without Cause means the company is letting you go usually due to restructuring or layoffs or something, but they do not require a reason. They must compensate you for this by way of a severance package, and you qualify for unemployment insurance."

As far as noticeability, that's a very subjective question. Some people cannot even tell the difference (or care to) between 1080p and 4k content. If you are one of those then you may get some peace of mind buying from the more well know name brands like LG or Samsung.

Your best bet by far is the TCL 6 series - I think it's the 615 at Best Buy (or the 613 at Costco) - which though not quite as good as the 625 in the US, is still a pretty darn solid set.
