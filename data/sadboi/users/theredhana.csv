I spent an awful lot of time thinking about whether God exists and what the meaning of my life is.

Today, my coworker complained about her job and we joked about it. I said: ""Maybe we inherited a fuckton of bad karma from our ancestors and now we have to pay the price.""

Having a vivid imagination is great, it helps you cope with reality in a beautiful way. It's hard, sometimes even impossible to get out of your own head. Stick to the people you know. Maybe volunteer for a church. Who knows, maybe you'll end up helping people in need."
