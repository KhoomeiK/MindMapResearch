Might have something to do with me not having much unmedicated sleep in the past few years. Preferred staying up at night since I was a teenager. Waking up early I’m often hit with anxiety.

Around 60% of people with bipolar abuse drugs and alcohol, likely as an attempt to manage their moods (self-medicarion).

I have bipolar. Psilocybin (shrooms) gave me moderate hypomania for a day in a middle of depression, gained lots of insight thanks to it. LSD was much more stimulating and hallucinogenic (fractals), made me anxious. DMT was out of this world (complete change of perception), thankfully it’s a short high, as it would be too intense if longer. Cocaine was just cocaine, loved it while it lasted, don’t think I experienced it differently than others. Amphetamines similarly. Weed at high dosages over prolonged time triggered paranoia. MDMA was nice and relaxing (mind that you risk potentially deadly serotonin syndrome if you’re on antidepressants, they also limit the effect).

I stopped doing drugs after getting diagnosed. I’d be happy to try psilocybin and ketamine in a controlled, medical setting. I doubt the former would be considered for bipolar, as the effect might be just too similar to the sense of clarity you experience during hypomania and mania."
