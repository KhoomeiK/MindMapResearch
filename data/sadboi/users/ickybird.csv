I like them because I feel much more grounded and I'm not feeling that awful fight-or-flight physical/mental anxiety combo.  Sativas tend to exacerbate that jittery-anxiety feeling for me and then I start overthinking which makes me more anxious.  Honestly any big name indica strain should be nice even at one or two puffs (thinking GDP) :) congrats on the med card!

Frankly they all have other toys and electronics to keep them occupied so...  You're not a parent, you paid for it, it's 100% yours.

She passed away one night on my living room floor next to me, as I had started sleeping down there when she was too weak to climb the stairs.  My advice - give your kitty a loving and warm send off while you can.  Waking up to her cold body is one of the worst feelings in the entire world.  Looking back, I wish I had put her to sleep much sooner and saved her some pain.  I'm sorry for your situation, and I know your kitty is going to be so happy and go somewhere great if you do decide to go the euthanasia route.  Good luck, stay strong!"
AmItheAsshole,f7p3ngx,t3_dx7hty,1573941304.0,"YTA.  My parents divorced when I was six and my younger brother four.  They split the time evenly, and eventually my brother and I wanted our separate time, just like your kids.  If my mom had told me I was not allowed to come home and spend one-on-one time with her so she could go on fun trips and spin class, I would have been devastated.  That leaves a lasting wound.  I won't try to convince you to do the right thing, but as someone who has grown from the same exact situation your kids are in, please think about this:

Would you rather have your solo time or ensure your kids grow up happy and mentally healthy?  Is your time alone worth hurting your children?  Because that's what this boils down to - if you have your pleasure time and ignore your children, you are hurting them and sending the message that mommy doesn't care about you.  Even if you can rationalize it to yourself, they can't at ages twelve and ten.  When you're that old, all you can wonder is why your mom doesn't love you enough, and what you personally did wrong to make it that way.

vaporents,f7gtyri,t3_dw4y51,1573717493.0,"So I started with the Pax 3 kit.  Heres what I liked: big bowl size (I smoke 2-3g a day), decent battery, discrete af.  Here's what was not-so-great: cleaning is a pain in the ass & it needs to be cleaned often, relatively loud smell, can't use it while charging, temp-specific heat is run by an app, and the device itself gets very hot, very fast.  

I recently got an ArGo from Arizer for about $110.  It's a great on-the-go dry herb vape and here's what makes me love it so much: glass mouthpiece so flavor is great and no burnt lips, device doesn't get too hot, digital temp display, can use it while charging, NO CLEANING except for glass tubes, and it's soo small and discrete with great vapor but little smell.  The only big downsides imo are the battery life (but you can use it while charging and it's easily popped out and swapped for a fully charged one), longer heat up, and the smalllll bowls.  I mean I go through like three or four a solo sesh.  But if you are like me, you can buy however many tubes you want and have them pre-packed and ready to go.  That's another big difference between the devices here too; the Pax is insanely hard to load while the ArGo takes 2 seconds.  ArGo is definitely a better portable vape for discreteness imo.

Additionally just a week ago I got an Arizer Solo II for at-home.  It's everything I love about the ArGo but with a stronggg battery (and able to use it charging), a short af heat up time, awesome vapor, and larger bowls for a better smoke.  Also the glass tubes make the herb taste pretty good (not to be a vape snob, I'll smoke pretty much anything to get high but I do appreciate me some refinery).  Only downside (and I knew this pre-purchase) is that it's mehhh about the discreteness.  Although I walk around on my college campus with it and haven't run into any troubles yet; who's going to stop me and ask if I'm vaping weed out of a glass tube?  Again I just pre-pack like seven tubes for a goooood session lol.  

Imo, get an Arizer product.  Pax 3 is not good enough for that price point.  I did a LOT of research before I bought my vapes (like I have ADHD and hyperfixated on dry herb vapes research) so this is based on both that and mostly my own personal experience.  If you want more info on any big-name vapes that usually float around on here, feel free to ask!  Hope this was helpful."

For example, reading - join a book club once you've become comfortable reading in your own home and find enjoyment in it.  He just said he's getting serious professional help.  He cannot spend 24/7 in a therapists office; even in psych wards, patients are encouraged to have hobbies such as drawing, reading, and exercise.
