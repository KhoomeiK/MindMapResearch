My interpretation would be if for some reason you wanted analgesic opiates or benzos for recreational use and your means was to see a doctor to get them, there would be a flag there to discourage it from being prescribed.

If you had an honest reason and need for it you would then be assessed for it I guess? They would just be cautious about prescribing. 

Hope this is relevant!"

With covid it has certainly cut back a lot of unnecessary spending, from this I hope I’ve developed a forced routine so to speak but even still.

I’m slowly putting more in to “savings” which isn’t much to begin with but it’s a start.

I think my biggest gripe with what’s happening at the moment is that some people have access to their superannuation funds. Fair enough if they have absolutely no option but this is their retirement fund that they have access too and I know a few people who have plans to buy a new car or get a breast augmentation.

WhitePeopleTwitter,fou7w2c,t3_g9aboi,1588078437.0,"Australian here. Private healthcare is an option. Public health care and bulk billing doctors are covered by Medicare. Tax payers contribute a small levy each year. People on any sort of government benefits have a concession card which means a lot of stuff is discounted. Prescriptions, public transport, education.

Private health care covers things like going to a private hospital for your care. The public system to me is just as good if it’s urgent. You can opt for hospital cover and extras (optical, dental, physiotherapy, naturopathy, chiropractor, gynaecology, hearing aids). You can get the hospital cover separate to the extras cover. I’m only covered for extras which my premium is $13 a fortnight and it covers me for 60% of the service.

Ambulances are free where I am based.

Do your own research.

Find out what you want to achieve. Medication, therapy.

Before I properly got diagnosed, I self-medicated and I consider myself to have an addictive personality so I know my reg flags and triggers.

Practice mindfulness. Listen to music.

Write down a list of who you think you are, what your personality is made up of. You need to establish a sense of self instead of ebbing and flowing with the environment and society.

Maybe write down a list of who you think you are each week. After 2 weeks, revise the list. What resonates? What circumstance has happened where you identify yourself with how you’re feeling after you are triggered by something.

I often draw blanks but I have my sense of self. It sometimes changes but I know who I am. I am taking meds. I need to find a psychologist who practices in dialectical behavioural therapy."

I was taking 25,50,100 over a span of time and my body is now used to 50. I take it at night.

I take it in combination with lexapro. Lexapro in the morning and Seroquel at night. In the mornings I’m a bit slow to get started but it gets better.

I have been conscious of the weight gain with the experience of gaining weight. When I first started I was SO HUNGRY it was ridiculous. Reevaluate your diet! Cut out the bad stuff if you can. I eat smaller and more nutrient dense foods and take a whole heap of vitimins in the morning.

This is the most stable I have been in a very long time.

I was off seroquel for awhile but the sleep went to shit and I became very irritated. Mood swings. All BP2 fun stuff *eye roll*.

Motivation is a bit low but it’s getting better.

It’s a marathon not a sprint!

Also if you are a female and taking contraception with seroquel it’s awful. Moody, uncontrollable hunger, headaches... the list goes on. I went off contraception because my mental health was more important than being a wreck.

Contraception alone made my mood suffer a lot. Hope this helps. Even if you’re not a female I hope there’s some information in there to help :)"

AskReddit,fo2evxb,t3_g53q03,1587459743.0,"A friend of mine, let’s call her Stacy. She had booked a holiday with her best friend to go sailing around Croatia. She was excited for it to say the least. She’s the kind of person who only posts photos to instagram with a filter or photos where she’s with the girls drinking cocktails. Loves travel, wanderlust etc.

She was fired from her job because she wasn’t getting the work done. The son of a lady who she was living with hired her to help her out and she still couldn’t manage it.

She broke the news to her friend and the friend was quite sympathetic about the whole situation. Stacy then cancels her booking with her friend after changing both their reservations in to her name so she could get the refund. Her friend was furious because it wasn’t discussed with her.

They both agreed that another friend would go in Stacy’s place once they had put the deposit down so Stacy could get  her refund.

Stacy, unemployed books in for a consultation to get a boob job.

Gets the boob job procedure. Completely ghosts her friend.

Here’s where my turn comes in. She gets a new job and a few months in asks if I want to go to an interstate music festival with her. I agree to it and buy my ticket and make the travel plans. This was done 6 months out from the festival.

She texts me about a month out asking if I know anybody who would buy her ticket as she hadn’t budgeted for it (now I rebutted to her that if she saved $30 a week from when she purchased the ticket until the festival it would cover everything. She just didn’t want to go.)

2 dog acts, 1 person.

TL;DR: Friend loses her job and cancels international holiday with her best friend and instead goes to get fake boobs
