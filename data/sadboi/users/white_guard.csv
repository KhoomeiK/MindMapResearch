Above is a picture of what you'll need, make a small bed of scourer inside it that can still take air through it, put small rocks of dark on top (or more rather inside) the scourer turn on 1 side and lick it with a flame. Hold rushie until it's run through to the bottom, use scourer to rub around the side of the pipe when you run out for a very good hit.

I think the only noticeable difference would be the result of variations in extended/controlled/enteric etc. release coating, some companies will use ferrous sulphate while other formulations might utilise cellulose polymers and whatnot.
Pill binders may differ but this having a noticeable effect aside from extremely rare allergic reactions I doubt, perhaps the best anecdotal evidence I've seen of different binder being noticeable is 30M boxes (oxy) as many claim some brands are outright better than others; whether that's true or a placebo I couldn't tell you, though I do remember reading that certain binders may absorb better or worse in some people.
