Powerlifting can be done any gym just by watching YouTube videos. Strongman requires technique too but it's more about just eating a lot.

 If you are serious about weightlifting you can go to a crossfit gym, but they also don't purely teach weightlifting. People in India don't care about weightlifting as it doesn't make you look ""aesthetic"". I learned the basics of weightlifting by just practising with a PVC bar for more than a year.
