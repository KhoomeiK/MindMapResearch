I stick her in the back of the tub while I wait to get the water temp just right and she’ll usually poop then and I’ll just clean it up and go from there
harrypotter,fqaftjj,t1_fqadnk7,1589218344.0,I don’t think he would’ve been a Gryffindor... he did great things for the good side but he was still a POS to children and other adults. He really held to his grudges throughout his life and let out his anger on pretty much everyone. He could still be brave and be a Slytherin imo.

On the bright side though, being bullied was one of the reasons I loved HP so much as a kid bc I related myself to him. Wasn’t fond of my home life, got bullied, but had friends that I liked being with at school."
harrypotter,fq8uhh5,t3_ggzpbn,1589175879.0,"I’m currently re-listening to all the audiobooks with my mom who has never read them. We listened to like the first 10-14 chapters or so and she wanted to put on the movie. After 5-10min we were already caught up to where we were in the book....

Goes to show how much was cut for the movies lol they’re still good though!!"
harrypotter,fq8teyy,t3_ghgewh,1589175013.0,"So I think they show two Slytherins that aren’t EVIL. 

Severus Snape.

Horace Slughorn.

We can all agree that Snape was a prick but he was also a very very grey character. He wasn’t evil though, and did the right thing in the end, gave his life for the most noble cause.

And Slughorn although maybe not as brave, still was a pretty nice fellow and fought in the battle of Hogwarts if I remember correctly.

With that said, it would’ve been nice to see more cool/nice Slytherins.. but it’s already proven that not all of them are evil. Undoubtedly a lot of Slytherins during Harry’s time were children of death eaters and/or friends of them like Pansy Parkinson who would probably have been willing to turn Harry over to Voldemort.

Personally I wish there had been cooler Hufflepuffs.. lol Cedric was the nicest/coolest Hufflepuff and he died.. Tonks was cool! But she wasn’t around much and also wasn’t in school with Harry. Zacharias Smith and Ernie and them were all described as “pompous” and the like and always seemed like they had their heads up their asses..."
