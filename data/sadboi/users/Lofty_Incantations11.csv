Anxiety,f3e5ljn,t3_dgedyv,1570858753.0,"Just come back to class, trust me, it’s better than dropping or failing. There are two scenarios here that you need to understand (1) your professor probably doesn’t take it personally when you miss (2) the bulk of your grade probably comes from assignments and not participation and (3) if none of the other two suffice, we professors are more inclined to work with you if you explain what’s going on than if you never contact us and drop of the face of the planet. An email will do.  Professors also suffer from anxiety. We get it. However, we can’t read minds so you have to let us know what’s up."

Professors,f14fy66,t3_d5p3i9,1569174214.0,"One year I wrote part of an assurance argument for accreditation. Part of my job was to find out whether our hiring practices followed EEOC guidelines. In short, they did not. I pinpointed a chair and the director of HR who actively conspired against hiring black folks. It was a scandal to say the least. My union filed a complaint on my behalf because immediately following the draft of the assurance argument the aforementioned chair wrote me up three times within a month for stupid shit. HR outright denied me due process and tried to shut my union rep out of disciplinary meetings. After the complaint was filed I was given whistleblower status and the next semester the entire office of HR was fired. So it worked out for me but it was absolute hell going through it. It was also the January Trump took office so it just felt like my world was falling apart."

It astounds me how much my self worth is tied to her happiness. If she isn’t happy at school or she has behavioral problems at school my self esteem as a parent is wrecked. Didn’t expect that at all and I’m convinced it’s what’s causing the majority of my wrinkles.
