ROCD,fqi7kan,t3_gizcjk,1589391820.0,Yes. I keep having dreams about cheating and it's making me feel so guilty and it makes me feel weird when I see my partner. Just remember that ocd doesnt turn off just because you're asleep. That's what I always tell myself.
ROCD,fq9qaf5,t1_fq9cziw,1589204785.0,Thank you for your response! Can you explain what you mean by the last part?
ROCD,fq86wlg,t1_fq7xsac,1589159725.0,Heavily relate on the cheating dreams part. I feel so much guilt
ROCD,fq6k8i7,t1_fq6j18j,1589133129.0,"Absolutely! Please message me if you ever need support,  it's really important to connect with people going through the same thing"
ROCD,fq6ipsb,t3_gh2e6v,1589132295.0,"Yes yes yes. All very very norm for ROCD. I've recently had new themes which scare me such as ""you're not ready for a relationship"" ""you dont want to be in a relationship"". Very scary and hard to separate what's real and what's not. Do check out GG relationship it's an app specifically for ROCD. Some of it is free and is a HUGE help."
ROCD,fq6ify3,t3_gh4fuw,1589132146.0,So relatable.
ROCD,fq6f15e,t3_gh2x8u,1589130259.0,"Hello! Those thoughts are completely normal. I have them too! The important thing to remember is that these thoughts, though they really really seem and feel scary, they truly are not in nature and they are, at least to me, not meant to be scary. I like to think of intrusive thoughts as a stubborn 5 year old that wants attention. Are 5 year olds scary? No. But they put up a fight to get what they want. Think of intrusive thoughts as a constant spinning wheel that you can look at but choose to walk past and go on with your day. Intrusive thoughts are so scary because what if they're true? But regardless, you get to make the choice to love who you have in the present which is your current partner."
ROCD,fq66r70,t3_gh1fmj,1589125631.0,"Hello! So I've done some research about BPD because of my major (I am in school for counseling) and here is my input. It's very very important to never shame yourself and feel guilt for your natural feelings and emotions. You CANNOT control how you feel. It is better to accept them as they are and think ""my feelings do not define me and I can make a conscious choice to be a great partner despite my anger"". You are not accountable for how you feel, but you are accountable for controlling the way that you act from those feelings. The next time you feel angry, remember that rumination will definitely be present to fuel the fire. It's important to handle the anger by stopping the rumination. Say ""I cannot solve my anger by dwelling over and over again. I am choosing to enjoy my day"". With practice and discipline, this can greatly help. Please be kind to yourself, you are suffering because of your emotions which you can't control. I hope this helps:)"
ROCD,fq662yu,t1_fq4vta6,1589125246.0,Hello! It's me from the post on ROCD
ROCD,fq4t7t8,t1_fq4t5lu,1589083620.0,Messaging you now!
ROCD,fq4osrc,t3_gghxku,1589080712.0,"No, to me it means the person loves you so much that they are willing to endure the difficulties of ocd to continue to enjoy their relationship with you! It varies for each person. But for me, I love my SO so much that the pain of ROCD is so worth it and I would choose it again and again if it meant being with him. ROCD is scary, but love the person that has it, and hold them when it gets difficult for them. A person with ROCD commits to choosing their partner no matter how bad it gets and I think that defines what love is."
ROCD,fq4nes2,t1_fq3sqhh,1589079960.0,Of course. And message me if you need to vent about what you're going through.  I'd love to be here for you
ROCD,fq3shpp,t1_fq3s055,1589069693.0,Definitely download GG Relationship. There are parts of it that are free and i can almost promise it will help you with your ROCD. It helped so much with mine!
ROCD,fpxbqh9,t3_gg2z9g,1588979532.0,"So the integral part to getting ROCD under control is avoiding trying to stop the thoughts. OCD is a monster that feeds off of fear. So for me what works on themes I'm already familiar with, is to think of the intrusive thoughts as a merry go round (as corny as this sounds), spinning continuously over and over in your mind. You can look at them from a distance and acknowledge them spinning but you have the power to walk past them and move on with your day. Don't add meaning, just let the thoughts spin, consciously repeat the negative thoughts in your mind constantly until you feel less anxious. Literally you can yell at yourself with the negative thoughts. Its scary because the intrusive thought of ""I dont feel anxious so the thought must he true"" feeling comes up, repeat that thought to yourself too. Your heart rate will eventually slow down with practice. I hope this helps.:)"
ROCD,fpwuthc,t3_gfx05f,1588970371.0,"Very normal with ROCD. There is always the textbook rocd advice,  realize you're checking, realize the thoughts are obsessive. let them pass by letting them play in your head multiple times trying each time to let it rotate without applying any meaning. Think of it as a merry go round that you can look at for a little and walk past, as cliche as it sounds."
ROCD,fps3vel,t1_fprhqzv,1588867021.0,This was actually really insightful. Thank you for this.

ROCD,fphs0qd,t3_gchm6r,1588626747.0,"Yes. I've been having dreams of me almost cheating every day for a week now and I feel so detached and disassociated with my partner following with thoughts like ""you're not ready for a relationship"". Its so exhausting.  I keep crying about it"
OCD,foylq2e,t3_g9tbhm,1588174773.0,Me too. It fucking sucks.
AskReddit,focjw7x,t3_g6hgtn,1587672193.0,"Not married to one but my stepmom is a Karen. Here is a summary.
My stepmom and my dad moved across the country after dating for a brief amount of time when I was four. So I had to visit them every summer. 
She was the typical Karen, verbally abusive to staff and restaurant employees, made fun of hotel staff for speaking ""bad english"", downplayed my moms struggle as a korean immigrant saying that her life ""wasnt all that bad"".
But here is the ultimate reason that my stepmom is a  Karen, she was a karen to me too.
She absolutely hated any attention my father gave me growing up. I remember making pictures for my dad when I was 6-7 and she would throw them in the trash and I'd be like 'that was for my dad' and she would always respond ""it was ugly, he wouldn't like them"". When I got older, my dad would take me fishing and she was always a massive bitch to my dad when we got back. I dont visit anymore but every phone call I have with him, he has to have it on speaker and my stepmom is always there listening and I'll even hear her add input to our conversations. Theres a lot more but the final straw was obviously when she was physically abusive, but also the one time when she got so angry at my dad giving me attention that she threw a birdcage sideways on my bed when I was 11.Shit and seeds everywhere all over my bed with the birds still in it. Another time she got so angry that I had pink eye and that my dad was concerned, she got so pissed that she refused to take me to a doctor because it ""wasnt that bad"" . She used to lie to my dad saying I did bad things that I never did.
Karen is the term used to describe a female narcissistic sociopath that has no empathy and wants to get rid of anything that takes the attention away from them/doesn't benefit them. Fuck Karens."
OCD,fnm6kie,t1_fnm5y0t,1587065975.0,"I was diagnosed with bipolar II earlier this year and through therapy also was diagnosed with OCD (pure O). My experience so far has been very confusing. OCD makes you think you're overexaggerating and making everything up. What if I'm not really bipolar and I over exaggerated? What if what I'm scared of isnt ocd and it's really how I feel? What if my impulsive and at times risky behaviors are just normal to being 21? Since other people do those things too? I know the diagnosis part doesnt matter and it's about treating symptoms (according to my psychiatrist). I'm currently on geodon, lamictal, and pristiq. My head is like well what if you're not really bipolar and dont need geodon??? Its just a mess. I talk to my psychiatrist about it and shes still set on me being bipolar, and asks every appointment if I've been manic"
ROCD,fn04sx6,t1_fn03ycc,1586535458.0,"Thank you so much for this, this was perfect."
ROCD,fmzzwee,t3_fv2jo1,1586532851.0,Yep. Had a shitty therapist that didn't understand my ocd and told me to leave my partner. I don't know how some people become therapists
OCD,fmpszx9,t3_fwptge,1586286785.0,Yep! I also have pure O. It's definitely difficult to deal with especially at this time. Mental compulsions are so hard to stop doing and even harder to actually pinpoint. I always thought my mental compulsions were just me thinking. And after doing years of therapy I learned that it is NOT simply me thinking and I've sabotaged a lot of my life from thinking my mental compulsions were my gut and intuition speaking to me and I must obey.
OCD,fmps7gk,t1_fmoryoq,1586286375.0,We're in this together:)
ROCD,fmhvxlo,t3_funj7a,1586095274.0,This is so beautiful. Thank you.
OCD,fmd0vnu,t1_fmco8tb,1585956878.0,"I completely relate to that. It's very painful to feel guilt over things you've never done, especially when your mind tells you that you've done them. It's like this back and forth that doesn't go away, but then when you tell someone this is going on it counts as reassurance so it's like how do you just live with guilt as if you've done something that you've never done?"
OCD,fmclb4t,t1_fmcksjx,1585947863.0,"My experience with it is very painful. I've sabotaged a lot of my life because of not being diagnosed. Pure OCD is when you have obsessions of course, but your compulsions for those obsessions are mental rather than physical compulsions! I learned I had pure O because of months with the same therapist who is very attentive. I honestly had no idea that I fit in to the ocd category because I couldn't ""see"" my compulsions."
OCD,flw6y8x,t3_frhy8h,1585541318.0,"I also suffer from that. It lasted about two months I think and it is terrifying. This was before my ocd diagnosis so I was like wtf is happening??? It goes away with time, but it is very scary. Hang in there it gets better. You can't talk yourself out of it, if you accept it and tell yourself ""okay I'm in a simulation"" instead of discussing it mentally obsessively, it helps it to go away"
OCD,flvtjvl,t3_frepqj,1585531777.0,Agreed
ROCD,flrh4ri,t1_flrgg8m,1585420088.0,"Thank you for your response, is it possible you could explain your situation further? Completely okay if not though I appreciate your response either way"
ROCD,flrdyfk,t3_fqb5fv,1585418255.0,Wait this is really scary. I'm sorry but this made me very anxious because I don't want there to be truth behind it. I dont want to leave my boyfriend I love him very much
ROCD,fllliqb,t1_flllbf8,1585262787.0,"Thank you for this. I just hate that every negative feeling feels like a death sentence (example: he hurt you deeply so you have to break up because it will never be the same). I wish I could feel as though I have the choice to stay or leave. With rocd, it makes me feel as though I have no choice and I must leave, If that makes any sense. Thank you again for your insight this was very helpful."
ROCD,fll8714,t3_fp2gq7,1585255415.0,Yep! I get this when I think about all the good memories I have with my boyfriend. It sucks but accepting the feeling that you have when you look at pictures and/or thinking about memories helps you to let it pass. But it is sad to deal with.
ROCD,fll6oeh,t3_fpdj30,1585254618.0,"I don't have an answer but I am going through the EXACT same thing. Committed relationships come with difficult times at times that you try to work through, but what about when it actually happens? How do we get past it when we feel hurt by what they've done? Of course we know we're obsessing. But the obsession is over something valid that hurts us. Like how do you let that go? 

Looking for advice as well."
ROCD,fll51fj,t1_flku647,1585253753.0,beautifully said.
ROCD,flexsyy,t1_flemb57,1585093712.0,"Instead of believing the thoughts, accept them. Believing makes you more anxious because you dont ""want"" to believe them. When you accept them and say ""okay. I dont love my boyfriend!"" Its terrifying but gradually it makes the thoughts less scary. Then, when you arent anxious about the thoughts, its ""oh my god I'm not anxious about the thoughts so it must really be how I feel"", not so. You're just gripping onto them and getting them under control."
OCD,flevota,t1_flesgh7,1585092469.0,"Absolutely, because both are scary and ocd loves to try to make us find a solution to make what scares us go away. It's so strange."
OCD,flecyin,t3_foa1yy,1585081989.0,"Yes. Every time I hear of a death or an illness, ocd gives me symptoms of whatever it is. For example, a girl from my school passed away from cardiac arrest. I started having panic attacks  over my heart stopping.  Every time I googled symptoms, I developed them"
OCD,flecdjs,t1_fle5l1h,1585081666.0,RIGHT?!
OCD,flecbrh,t3_fo5eea,1585081638.0,Wow in the same boat. Crazy! Theres a literal pandemic and my ocd is trying to tell me I'm a terrible person and I cant get my head off of it (mental compulsions). This somehow feels worse than the fact that I could get covid 19.

ROCD,fl2ljxx,t3_fhgkiz,1584753913.0,I was actually very triggered and uncomfortable from the show. It made me feel guilty for some reason. Perfect exposure therapy!
ROCD,fl2l8i7,t3_fiqh0e,1584753697.0,Yes! It makes me want to avoid men altogether. I feel like if I think someone else is attractive then I am cheating. It's the worst!
ROCD,fl2kyjo,t3_fkidfm,1584753507.0,"Classic rocd. Having intrusive thoughts that cause so much pain that you can't function is exactly what ocd looks like when it's hitting the hardest!

ROCD,fl2klju,t3_fkoi3f,1584753257.0,"I can relate. One time I told his friend I appreciated him (we are all friends) while I was arguing with my boyfriend and my head told me I cheated. Out of extreme guilt I told my boyfriend and he was like ""that is...so silly"" LOL"
ROCD,fl2khqj,t3_fkqt1m,1584753182.0,"Completely relatable. It's essentially the realization that you deserve to be happy and in a loving relationship despite the fact that it feels selfish (what if I hurt him, what if I can't  do it, etc). We deserve to be loved just like anyone else."
ROCD,fl2kcwk,t3_fl4mqv,1584753088.0,"I've had therapists disregard my OCD as well. Its very normal unfortunately that they take this route. Really, its worth taking the time to find the right therapist as triggering as the journey can be (being told over and over that you're just not feeling it) I've had therapists tell me ""just because you're happy doesnt mean you're in the right relationship choose yourself first"" like WHAT?! it's not about ""gaining feelings back"" for your partner or anything, it's about learning what your obsessions and what your compulsions are so that you arent doing knee jerk reactions (which I'm vv guilty of)"

OCD,fkyc6ku,t3_fla3ss,1584645828.0,"Wow, thank you for this, I didnt realize there was a name for what I went through.  I have pure OCD but always wondered why the hell I obsessively question the meaning of life until I genuinely feel as though nothing really exists. That I'm in the wrong dimension or something. This actually helped a lot. With that  being said, I cant recommend a medication but I am currently on lamictal and geodon (for bipolar) and pristiq for ocd and depression. This combined with naming ocd thoughts (I call them ""fred"") works wonders."

ROCD,fj9jvb9,t3_fc8kom,1583151217.0,"There is absolutely a chance. It's important to understand that it will not go away, you cant make it go away, but you can practice some things to alleviate it enough for the thoughts to pass. I name my ocd flare ups ""fred"" to separate myself from the thoughts, so they don't define me. This makes it a tiny bit easier. I also tell myself ""it's not me. Its ocd"". If it feels like it might be OCD, it IS ocd! Allow the thoughts to be there and practice your breathing. Make yourself breakfast, do good things for yourself. It will pass."
BipolarReddit,fj9jich,t3_fc7s5m,1583150843.0,"I completely understand. I'm constantly torn between either slowly losing the friend, or telling them I'm struggling mentally. But I dont always want to tell people I'm not close with personal things such as that I'm struggling with mental health (because they may invalidate that/think I'm using excuses) so usually I just let them space.

It's so difficult to stop doing mental compulsions because they seem to be automatic. What I remember is I name the obsessions ""fred"" as dumb as that sounds, because it separates me from the thoughts so i dont feel as though they are ""me"" and dont define me. It is so hard to not sit in bed and be miserable for days on end when the thoughts are too much. I started reading this book from amazon called ""brain lock"". It is a book about controlling ocd. I would highly recommend.  Additionally, I try to do something that makes me genuinely happy in the middle of a terrible episode so I can slowly stop associating the obsessions with ""bad"". Its a slow process. I am sorry you're suffering this bad :("
