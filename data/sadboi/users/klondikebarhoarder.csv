I'm a 31-year-old gay junkie who keeps getting sober for 3-4 weeks, feels pretty good, I guess, until something suddenly comes up:  Time to fill my Ritalin, oh wait I just manipulated my doctor to change it to Focalin since I'm a total psychopharmacology geek (go figure!) stimulants have always been favorite of everything, Adderall is a sly one... love it, have good intentions, plan to take as prescribed, until it kicks in and I start thinking of hot things, and I fight temptation with every fiber of my homosexual life challenged being,  I black out and end up having a very sexual night with myself because I have low confidence and body dysmorphia, which provides a feeling of looking like a monster straight out of the hills have eyes, then you look in a different mirror and you're pretty handsome but then my reflection morphs into Shrek in drag.  To avoid perceived embarrassment based on my distorted perception of myself.  When I'm on adderall and friends, I see myself as fuckable for sure, I have a fat dick with a disciplined ass lmao can fit jet ski up there maybe , but it's tight at the same time.  Ok then, I think I should put the Focalin away and consider not posting on reddit lol , message me if you ever need to talk, have a good night man.  Things change all the time, I think about Suicide every day, but I can't do it while my mom is alive.  Will not ever hurt her like that.  But other than my mom, I have 1 friend I've known since I was 11, but we only text.  My life wasn't supposed to be anything like this at 31.  So I understand how you're feeling.  It's lonely not having anyone to love and be loved by, and have friends again, like when I was in my 20s and still felt alive.  Suddenly life is boring , all times not just because of the corona.  On top of it I still live at home.  I'm numb to it now lol idk what gonna happen, and the future is looking bleak, and I'm getting some aging signs on my face already.  Hang in there dude.  I'll be awake all night if you get lonely.  Take care üôÉ"
