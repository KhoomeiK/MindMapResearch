I will say I‚Äôve been impressed with Robbins and the U of A throughout this entire thing; it sounds like they‚Äôre making an effort to keep a lot of the summer program gigs going online in a virtual format, and I‚Äôll still be getting a stipend for said program (even though that‚Äôs probably federal Grant money and not university money).

I (stupidly) went on vacation to Orlando in early/mid March for the U of A‚Äôs spring break (despite my nurse mom‚Äôs extreme desire to cancel; in hindsight, her instincts were probably right. Thankfully everyone in our party of 8 has remained healthy, and we immediately started self-isolation ever since returning). Admittedly, the theme parks, hotels, and airports had hand sanitizer readily available. Some people wore masks. With that being said, the mood in the parks was incredibly light and relaxed. Sure, I was getting highlights daily from the NYT, but based on the attitude and business of the theme parks, you would have never thought that there was an epidemic (turned pandemic mid trip) going on. I even remember seeing a Make a Wish kid with their family having the time of their life, giggling away. 


I will never forget landing in Tucson on March 11th at 11 am and proceeding to watch American society come to a complete standstill as I unpacked and disinfected my clothing/luggage. In a manner of hours, I watched the NCAA cancel March madness and spring events, the NBA postponing the rest of their season, Broadway announcing a shutdown, effective immediately,  and the Walt Disney Company announce that they would be closing their theme parks at the end of the week (of one I was at literally less than 12 hours ago). 

I‚Äôm very fortunate that my family remains healthy, and continues to have steady employment and source of income, and have the resources to continue my education online, but can‚Äôt help but continue to be shocked by the almost immediate transition from an amazing trip, contrasted almost immediately with incredibly dark times and recovery that we are currently facing as a national and international level."

Started listening to David for rational, nuanced, liberal takes, and over the course of the year, I found myself being able to see nuance in views, identify Shapiro‚Äôs strategy (having a JD from one of the top law schools in the country and arguing with 18 year olds living on ramen and four lokos?

I highly recommend making use of it. The rec is the busiest in the morning/evening; if you can go in between classes from like 10-3, then it's less busy. 

2) The U of A  is massive. There are people all over the partying spectrum and it's awesome! I highly recommend having a car in Tucson if possible to check out more than just 4th/University/downtown. Tucson is a car town, and it makes it way easier to travel to get groceries/explore town/etc. With regards to the outdoors, I always see posts from students spending the weekend hiking/going up Mt. Lemmon/camping/exploring the national parks. The weather is beautiful out here, especially November-April. Overall, Tucson's food scene is amazing. The surrounding 4th Ave/University boulevard area has plenty of great eats for any appetite, and it's all just a quick ride away on the streetcar. On-campus specifically, it's mostly fast food joints (Chick Fil A, Sandwich Joints, Steak N' Shake, etc), and it can get EXTREMELY busy during lunchtime, so I typically bring my own food from home. 

3) Not sure about engineering, but my friends seem pretty happy with it. Raytheon and IBM are here and huge; I think that they might have some summer internship opportunities

I‚Äôm not claiming to be a public health professional as the OP apparently is, but if I were to say that this epidemic has a 66% mortality rate my epidemiology professor would have ripped me a new one and would tell me to look at relative risk, absolute risk, etc before promoting such a big claim. We simply don‚Äôt have a lot of information yet about this particular strain, and it‚Äôs dangerous, and irresponsible to make such a big claim with regards to mortality rate at this stage IMO."
UofArizona,ff49ubz,t3_eraihz,1579558685.0,"I‚Äôm a senior majoring in PSIO and took the class ~2 years ago; things are probably a little (or a lot) different now, but here‚Äôs how I remember it: 
Typically at the beginning of lab you‚Äôll turn in whatever homework was assigned the previous week. This is usually a brief anatomical labeling exercise from what I remember. Then, you usually take a quiz (I think quizzes are weekly?) based on primarily last week‚Äôs lecture with a bit of the new week incorporated (it honestly depends on your TA; and every TA does things a little differently. For 201, we had word bank fill in the blanks and multiple choice with relatively few short answers). 

After your lab quiz, there‚Äôs usually lecture from the remaining time, with activities spaced intermittently throughout (could be labeling models with tape, could be a dissection of some sort). Oftentimes the lab preceptor will also give a presentation about a disease related to the lab lecture material. 

Oh boy, do I not miss practicals at all. They were the bane of my 201 grade and I had no idea how to study for them at the time. You have to know your anatomy to do well; hence, the focusing on labeling models in lecture. Basically, you move from station to station with a different model/question at each table, and you have about a minute to identify whatever the model is referring to or answer the question. Usually, the structure of interest is highlighted with a tape arrow (which can be somewhat unclear, and definitely talk to the TA if you‚Äôre unsure.) 

While there are specified study rooms in Gittings with the models set up and tape for you to label them with TAs who have office hours, it‚Äôs a pretty tight space to work in and is usually pretty crowded.  There are several great study sources on YouTube for A&P that I never knew about at the time, such as Ninja Nerd Science who has great anatomy lectures with models similar to the ones presented in class. A lot of my friends really liked using quizlet and Anki; while others printed class lectures beforehand and annotated them in lab, and a few had iPads to download lectures, use Anatomy apps, and take pictures of the models to incorporate into their notes. 

If I were retaking the class now I would definitely look for alternative methods of explanation online (such as Khan Academy, Ninja Nerd Science, etc) and invest in some sort of virtual note taking device such as an iPad. Purchasing one has made a night and day difference in the quality of my notes, but it obviously isn‚Äôt the most frugal or accessible option. IMO, if getting an iPad or tablet isn‚Äôt possible (lol #champagneproblems), I would highly recommend printing notes beforehand if possible and annotating them using some sort of color coating system, while also taking pictures of the models with your phone to create flash cards. 

Luckily, lab shouldn‚Äôt make a huge dent in your grade from what I remember; and if you have both a lecture exam and practical in the same week, prioritize the lecture exam!"
