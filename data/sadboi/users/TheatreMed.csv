Hell, I even remember thinking that Robbins was being over cautious when he extended break by two days and cancelled in person classes in the middle of break. 

I’m supposed to graduate in December, and was indecisive between walking either this May or next. I literally had plans to go to GradFest when we got back to buy a cap and gown. Guess the U of A made that decision for me. I understand why it’s canceled, but god, it sucks. I was looking forward to either walking or supporting my pals, and am saddened you May 2020 grads all lost out on your last few weeks of savoring sweet university life and saying a proper goodbye to the U and Main Gate and 4th Ave. 

I will say I’ve been impressed with Robbins and the U of A throughout this entire thing; it sounds like they’re making an effort to keep a lot of the summer program gigs going online in a virtual format, and I’ll still be getting a stipend for said program (even though that’s probably federal Grant money and not university money).

I (stupidly) went on vacation to Orlando in early/mid March for the U of A’s spring break (despite my nurse mom’s extreme desire to cancel; in hindsight, her instincts were probably right. Thankfully everyone in our party of 8 has remained healthy, and we immediately started self-isolation ever since returning). Admittedly, the theme parks, hotels, and airports had hand sanitizer readily available. Some people wore masks. With that being said, the mood in the parks was incredibly light and relaxed. Sure, I was getting highlights daily from the NYT, but based on the attitude and business of the theme parks, you would have never thought that there was an epidemic (turned pandemic mid trip) going on. I even remember seeing a Make a Wish kid with their family having the time of their life, giggling away. 


I will never forget landing in Tucson on March 11th at 11 am and proceeding to watch American society come to a complete standstill as I unpacked and disinfected my clothing/luggage. In a manner of hours, I watched the NCAA cancel March madness and spring events, the NBA postponing the rest of their season, Broadway announcing a shutdown, effective immediately,  and the Walt Disney Company announce that they would be closing their theme parks at the end of the week (of one I was at literally less than 12 hours ago). 

I’m very fortunate that my family remains healthy, and continues to have steady employment and source of income, and have the resources to continue my education online, but can’t help but continue to be shocked by the almost immediate transition from an amazing trip, contrasted almost immediately with incredibly dark times and recovery that we are currently facing as a national and international level."

At the time, thought that we lived in a post racism era, hated identity politics, etc. Then I watched his interview with David Pakman on gun control and watched him completely sputter his way through and got my first inkling that the guy wasn’t nearly as legit as I thought he was. Started listening to David for rational, nuanced, liberal takes, and over the course of the year, I found myself being able to see nuance in views, identify Shapiro’s strategy (having a JD from one of the top law schools in the country and arguing with 18 year olds living on ramen and four lokos? I’d hope he performs pretty well), and realize that he’s (and Rubin and Crowder for that matter) pro identity politics when it suits him. Likewise, that our identities obviously influence our world view and hence, politics. 

The straw that broke the camels back that turned me off of Shapiro forever? His completely garbage, condescending take about black people being excited about Black Panther. Dude wanted to stir up controversy because he knows his base will eat it up. 

I think that the most upsetting thing is that unlike Crowder, Shapiro’s a smart guy. He’s just a straight up bad faith actor who has no real yearning for the respectful political discourse that he says he does.

I highly recommend making use of it. The rec is the busiest in the morning/evening; if you can go in between classes from like 10-3, then it's less busy. 

2) The U of A  is massive. There are people all over the partying spectrum and it's awesome! I highly recommend having a car in Tucson if possible to check out more than just 4th/University/downtown. Tucson is a car town, and it makes it way easier to travel to get groceries/explore town/etc. With regards to the outdoors, I always see posts from students spending the weekend hiking/going up Mt. Lemmon/camping/exploring the national parks. The weather is beautiful out here, especially November-April. Overall, Tucson's food scene is amazing. The surrounding 4th Ave/University boulevard area has plenty of great eats for any appetite, and it's all just a quick ride away on the streetcar. On-campus specifically, it's mostly fast food joints (Chick Fil A, Sandwich Joints, Steak N' Shake, etc), and it can get EXTREMELY busy during lunchtime, so I typically bring my own food from home. 

3) Not sure about engineering, but my friends seem pretty happy with it. Raytheon and IBM are here and huge; I think that they might have some summer internship opportunities

Likewise, a lot of medical facilities are having a shortage of personal protective equipment and staff are having to resort to using homemade masks or bandanas instead of surgical masks or (ideally) N-95s.

Like a normal early/mid 20 year old out there living her best life, having fun, living her best life and now she’s in a marriage with a narcissistic, emotionally abusive punk who couldn’t land a fundie woman his own age probably because of said traits. I really, really can’t stand her smugness and holier than thou attitude, but this is just unfortunate to see."

Disgusting."

Coronavirus,ffhfx8y,t1_ffhcmoa,1579933558.0,"I’m curious about this too. From what I’ve read so far, it seems like those who have unfortunately passed are primarily older people who are likely already immunocompromised due to age or other disease factors.

I’m not claiming to be a public health professional as the OP apparently is, but if I were to say that this epidemic has a 66% mortality rate my epidemiology professor would have ripped me a new one and would tell me to look at relative risk, absolute risk, etc before promoting such a big claim. We simply don’t have a lot of information yet about this particular strain, and it’s dangerous, and irresponsible to make such a big claim with regards to mortality rate at this stage IMO."
UofArizona,ff49ubz,t3_eraihz,1579558685.0,"I’m a senior majoring in PSIO and took the class ~2 years ago; things are probably a little (or a lot) different now, but here’s how I remember it: 
Typically at the beginning of lab you’ll turn in whatever homework was assigned the previous week. This is usually a brief anatomical labeling exercise from what I remember. Then, you usually take a quiz (I think quizzes are weekly?) based on primarily last week’s lecture with a bit of the new week incorporated (it honestly depends on your TA; and every TA does things a little differently. For 201, we had word bank fill in the blanks and multiple choice with relatively few short answers). 

After your lab quiz, there’s usually lecture from the remaining time, with activities spaced intermittently throughout (could be labeling models with tape, could be a dissection of some sort). Oftentimes the lab preceptor will also give a presentation about a disease related to the lab lecture material. 

Oh boy, do I not miss practicals at all. They were the bane of my 201 grade and I had no idea how to study for them at the time. You have to know your anatomy to do well; hence, the focusing on labeling models in lecture. Basically, you move from station to station with a different model/question at each table, and you have about a minute to identify whatever the model is referring to or answer the question. Usually, the structure of interest is highlighted with a tape arrow (which can be somewhat unclear, and definitely talk to the TA if you’re unsure.) 

While there are specified study rooms in Gittings with the models set up and tape for you to label them with TAs who have office hours, it’s a pretty tight space to work in and is usually pretty crowded.  There are several great study sources on YouTube for A&P that I never knew about at the time, such as Ninja Nerd Science who has great anatomy lectures with models similar to the ones presented in class. A lot of my friends really liked using quizlet and Anki; while others printed class lectures beforehand and annotated them in lab, and a few had iPads to download lectures, use Anatomy apps, and take pictures of the models to incorporate into their notes. 

If I were retaking the class now I would definitely look for alternative methods of explanation online (such as Khan Academy, Ninja Nerd Science, etc) and invest in some sort of virtual note taking device such as an iPad. Purchasing one has made a night and day difference in the quality of my notes, but it obviously isn’t the most frugal or accessible option. IMO, if getting an iPad or tablet isn’t possible (lol #champagneproblems), I would highly recommend printing notes beforehand if possible and annotating them using some sort of color coating system, while also taking pictures of the models with your phone to create flash cards. 

Luckily, lab shouldn’t make a huge dent in your grade from what I remember; and if you have both a lecture exam and practical in the same week, prioritize the lecture exam!"
