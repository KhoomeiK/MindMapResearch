NoFap,fmlt6sv,t3_fw0h3z,1586192773.0,"Hello! Sorry to hear that you‚Äôre worrying about this so much. You‚Äôre getting a long response because it sounds like you‚Äôre taking this very seriously. Your circling around the question ‚Äúis it worth it to have sex?‚Äù ... the answer is yes. The fact that you‚Äôre asking the question means that it‚Äôs worth it. You‚Äôre thinking about it - therefore you want it......
Okay, now that we‚Äôve established that you want to experience it at least once, we come to step 2.... how?.....
Well, let me give you some advice. If you have sex for the first time, and it isn‚Äôt a wholesome enjoyable experience, and you‚Äôve been suspense-fully waiting for sex for 26 years, then it could do permanent damage. A bad sexual experience could damage your sexual function for years to come, or for life. So, what‚Äôs most important is not IF you have sex, but rather HOW you have sex and WHO you have it with.
Could you find a hooker for sex? Yes. Would it damage you? Possibly. Could you find a random slut? Eventually yes. Would it damage you? Possibly.
What you need to set yourself on a healthy path is a genuine relationship, where you go through the steps (holding hands, first kiss, make out, etc etc) slowly over time until you finally seal the deal. This is harder to find but trust me - it is very very worth it.
How do we accomplish that? Well here‚Äôs my advice.
First thing first, you gotta get sexy. Talk to female friends, female coworkers, gay male friends, sister, female cousin, or even random females on reddit. Ask them what is physically and personality related UNNATRACTIVE about you. Fix those things. Talk to the same women again. Confirm that you‚Äôve made improvement. Ask for advice on anything else you can do to be more attractive. Now you‚Äôre sexy.
Next step: level up your confidence game. Get better at talking to sexy women. Walk around public places and practice talking to strangers. Compliment random women who walk past. It‚Äôll be awkward at first, but over time you‚Äôll get better at it. Don‚Äôt be creepy or weird, just keep it casual.
Once you‚Äôre good at this, it‚Äôs time to move forward. If you have any women you already like who are close to you (coworkers, class mates, friends) then start there first. If that‚Äôs not an option, you can try meeting women in person in social settings. If that‚Äôs too difficult, make an online dating profile and specify that you‚Äôre ‚Äúlooking for something serious.‚Äù.
Once you get a first date, you need to go over the top NICE GUY. Dozen roses, hold the door open for her, nice expensive date, etc... make sure she knows you take this seriously. Don‚Äôt be fake and scripted - just be yourself. The goal is for you to fall in love. After multiple dates, she will probably give you signs that she‚Äôs physically interested. Make sure she knows that you‚Äôre a virgin, and that you want to try sex. But don‚Äôt sound desperate or creepy, at all costs. Eventually you‚Äôll have sex and hopefully have fun. Good luck :) and just to be clear - whether you have sex or not has NOTHING to do with elevated social status. That‚Äôs total BS."

I‚Äôve been lifting weights and trying to eat big for the past 5 years with limited success. But I‚Äôm the past 8 months I‚Äôve put on like 30 lbs and am now 245 lbs... the secret? I realized I wasn‚Äôt pushing hard enough in the gym. Now every single set, I lift like there‚Äôs someone with a gun to my head forcing me to get 1 more rep in. Go to failure every set, no matter the weight. Load up the bar as heavy as you can and focus on form. Going past failure is what did it for me. Exercises that give me the most gains from experience: weighted dips, weighted pull ups, weighted squats. Try to shoot for MAX 5 reps on these. And eat all day long"
