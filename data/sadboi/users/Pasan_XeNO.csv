Just because they suddenly decided to give away a decade year old game that has a sequel coming in the horizon doesn't automatically make them good.

Don't forget their shitty roots. I don't care if they were to give a 100 free games per day their dick moves will always be dick moves however you put it.

Anyone who says otherwise or thinks that such are stone-aged concepts are simply too weak to accept reality or are fooling themselves with ideas that they think are modern and justifiable. When in reality, these ""modern"" ideas & movements have existed since forever and they will continue to exist because there will always be a part of society that are simply incapable of accepting the human way of life. They will always feed their minds with reason to continue by contributing to such movements until they die. That's just how it is.

srilanka,fo6yazz,t1_fo6tto0,1587568969.0,"Right now my only priority is fixing the computer. Because I don't know what's going to be the state of the country in a few weeks and the longer I wait, the narrower my chances become. I need the computer for my work and that's what matters and here in Chilaw, there aren't lot of trustworthy repair shops to be found if any at all.

The issue with my laptop is that yesterday the cooling fan started making a noise and when I checked it, it was wiggling. When the fan starts spinning it makes a very unsatisfying tractor like noise. And I'm guessing it's either in contact with some other internal component which it isn't supposed to be in contact with or the fan itself has become loose (or stuck). I tried cleaning but found no luck. I can still turn on the computer and use it for a couple of minutes but as soon as the fan starts spinning it becomes unusable and I'm afraid that continuous usage could permanently damage the fan and other internal components.

As for the backup laptop, it's in Galkissa. Which is still in lockdown and has been marked a red zone I think. I doubt that even if I do manage to get a curfew pass somehow, I won't be allowed to get into Galkissa area. I think.. I'll try contacting the police anyways. Thanks for the advice."

Warthunder,fnsbrn2,t3_g3jgcj,1587218079.0,"No Britain is NOT a good nation to start with. Believe me. As someone who plays only air RB, I too started with Britain and as good as the Spitfires are, allied aircraft become cannon fodder to German MG 151s once you reach tier 2,3 and 4. At least playing US you get to face the Japanese. But Britain almost always face Germans in these tiers and this alone made me drop the game for a whole year after only 3 weeks I started.

As of me writing this, the title of most noob friendly nation easily goes to Sweden. At least for air RB it is. Like it says on the post their guns are godly even for the tier 1 planes. Extremely reliable weaponry with decent to really good aircraft throughout the tree. Relatively less work to reach top tier due to fewer number of aircraft to be researched and *very* favorable matchmaking (for now). Apart from top tier, 80% the time they either have to face each other or USSR which imo is the least threatening nation for air RB from tiers 2-4."
