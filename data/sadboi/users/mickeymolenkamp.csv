I do this. I know that no one I know has anxiety like me and I accept that. When you meet someone who does,  you know and they know and you generally hit it off. 

Try not to concern yourself with others' views. All you can do is tell someone you have severe anxiety and be done."
HealthAnxiety,fp4zetm,t3_gb7to6,1588311566.0,Pretend your anxiety is a little green creature poking you and wanting to just hang out. Picture him with a squeaky annoying voice. Invite him in and tell. Him he is welcome to stay as long as he likes. Don't fight or fear him. Know he is there and be okay with him. This helped me lose the fear of him and thus experiencing him/it without the fear and perpetuating cycle of increased anxiety due to the fear.

I'm about to go on my weed quitting journey and I'm on day 2 and the anxiety and insomnia and vivid dreams are definitely scary. Peace be with you."

Anxiety,fmyxixx,t3_fxsddo,1586498895.0,I often need my husband to hug me and squeeze for a while to compress my chest. Or I lay down and he presses my chest.
HealthAnxiety,fmywpg2,t3_fj9h57,1586498121.0,Have you tried hinging at the waist so your head is upside down? This helps me a bit.
Anxiety,fmywkea,t1_fmyvldx,1586497994.0,Thank you so much.
Anxiety,fmywjor,t1_fmyw3ig,1586497976.0,This MADE me smile. Thank you
Anxiety,fmyweos,t3_fy9eg1,1586497847.0,"I completely feel you. I am having the same right now, racing heart and tight chest, worry of more severe problems, endless cycle of thoughts and ""what ifs.""

Literally try standing up, making your legs a V, bending at your waist, hanging your head Upside down and turn and wiggle your head. 

This helps me at my most panicked moments. Also if you have a foam roller or anything of the sort, lay on it on your back and stretch open your chest to stretch it out. Also the back massage aspect helps distract from your symptoms. 

You are not alone. Hang in there."
Anxiety,fmyvq7y,t3_fy78m6,1586497237.0,"I have been having severe chest tightness, heart palpitations randomly, a racing heart, a dry throat, butterflies and chest pain. I believe stress and anxiety can and does cause major physical responses. I know because my symptoms are usually accompanied by fear and worry and psychological issues.  Try and know you aren't alone. Have a better day"
Anxiety,fmyrxlu,t3_fq8z5a,1586493970.0,I have always wondered how to name what I felt or even how to describe it without sounding trivial or dumb. Thank you so much for giving me words lol Did it help to find out so many people identify with you? I'm sure as hell shocked by the number of people!
