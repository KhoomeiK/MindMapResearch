astrology,fj6f99y,t1_fj6egp4,1583070033.0,In my experience it's best to let sleeping dogs lay.  A taurus can be brutal. It could hurt you more then you know. I'd try a call if anything so he hears your voice. That's your best way in. Communication online in messages it is too easy to impose your feelings into it without seeing his side.  I myself am dueling with my taurus atm. Through messages and long distance. Communication as I said is hard. Best bet is to try and reach him in person.
astrology,fj6dycc,t3_fbtrue,1583068719.0,"Those are all very typical Taurus qualities from my experience.
