benzorecovery,fr3w365,t3_glqh3k,1589867915.0,"If you averaged 6-8mg per day prior, try something like this:

1mg morning, midday, night for 14 days

See how you feel on that. If you feel fine, you should buy a scale on amazon (usually advertised for weighing jewelry). Weigh 1mg (half tab). Then, try to reduce one dosage by 10% for 7-14 days. Best to start with the midday dose.

I have no idea what the tablets weigh, but say half of the 2mg tablet (1mg) weighs 10mg. You would then shave off some of the half-tablet so that it weighed 9mg.

Thus you would take: 1mg AM, 90% of 1mg midday, 1mg PM.

Continue to reduce midday dosage like this until 0 (must recalculate 10% each time‚Äî so next 10% drop would be 10% of 9mg weight = 8.1mg weight). Next, work on the morning dose in the same manner.

I don‚Äôt know if this schedule is possible for you with your supply. You didn‚Äôt say if it was regularly prescribed.

**After I typed this, I remembered you said 30 count of 2mg = 60mg total for the month. In that case, try the formula I described, but you‚Äôll have to start with 1mg AM and 1mg PM."

I‚Äôm okay to eat if I‚Äôm with my husband or other certain people because they can theoretically save me if I do choke. But, I still take much smaller bites than I used to.

I had a swallow study done and it was mostly normal. The abnormal aspect was the delay in swallowing, which is not surprising because I know I do that and a learned behavior from being afraid to swallow.

I see a psychiatrist, psychologist, and I‚Äôm about to start therapy with a speech-language pathologist (SLP). üí∏ Medicine helps a little. Therapy helps a little.
