I‚Äôm sure the rejection probably hurt him but I didn‚Äôt realize it at the time. The next day, and for a while after that, he started texting me really sexual rude messages and calling me a bitch, a lesbian, etc. It really bothered me because I didn‚Äôt understand it and he wouldn‚Äôt back off until I told him off enough times. So the summer after my senior year, he messaged me to apologize. He asked me if we could still be friends. I told him I could forgive him because he was sincere in his apology and because I had moved past it in my own mind. But I told him I couldn‚Äôt be friends with him.

Misogyny and other types of hatred do not always have to be extremely obvious. And not everyone is educated on what that looks like in a relationship or even in general. Let‚Äôs say a woman grows up in a home where subtle misogynistic comments are thrown around frequently and lets also say that it comes from within the family. It doesn‚Äôt even have to come from men, women can be misogynistic as well. How is someone who grew up in that environment supposed to not see that as normal? So when they become of dating age and into adulthood what kind of relationship do you think they‚Äôre going to look for? One that is modeled for them as normal. And what is normal for them? Misogyny. I know that the current climate in certain parts of the world (don‚Äôt know where you live) is one where people will convince themselves of anything to not acknowledge and recognize parts of themselves that need change and are harmful to others, so if you‚Äôre still going to cling to the idea that you don‚Äôt have those views towards women, there‚Äôs nothing more I can say to get you to accept that there‚Äôs a part of you that could change for the positive. That‚Äôs what happens, people say racism isn‚Äôt real but lynchings still happened. People say homophobia is a myth but children have been psychologically tortured in conversion therapy.

Because you can still enjoy the benefits of having a partner even if you see them as less than human. Your misogyny allows you to enjoy the sex without considering if it is enjoyable for her. And before you say ‚Äúif she didn‚Äôt enjoy it she wouldn‚Äôt do it/be with me‚Äù there are a lot of people in this world who did not grow up knowing what it means to be appreciated, loved, and respected. So in turn they become adults who involve themselves with people who may perform obligatory acts of decency to get what they want ‚Äúsex, companionship, friendship, etc‚Äù but because they see them as subhuman, they don‚Äôt have any reason to show them love, appreciation, or even respect.

If it‚Äôs not going to come up or it‚Äôs not something major like ‚ÄúI murdered someone and spent 20 yrs in prison‚Äù then I would just thinking about what stage of our relationship will it become relevant and would make a decision to prepare them for that knowledge as that stage starts to appear closer on the horizon. But if it doesn‚Äôt affect them you are not obligated to disclose. But it‚Äôs completely up to you if you want to tell them. Like another example is if I was hiv +. If I am friends with someone who doesn‚Äôt know, I may choose not to tell them and that would be my choice. But if that friendship developed into a sexual or romantic relationship, I would need to tell them because there is now a risk that they need to be aware of so that they have autonomy to choose whether they want to be involved in that risk no matter how high the risk is.

dating,fhfprrg,t3_f2es8f,1581548494.0,"One thing I learned based on past experience is that when there is a feeling of financial obligation like for a gift or a special occasion where something is being celebrated someone who is broke or barely scraping by will handle this in a few different ways: 

1) They may just not get you anything and not talk to you about it which if you know they are aware of any expectation, means that they did not consider it as an issue and do not mind that you are going without which I see as an issue.

2) They could know they have barely anything but try their hardest to make it work and do something to follow through with the expectation to not make waves. Perfectly fine if that‚Äôs what they want to do but it‚Äôs not necessary if you go for the next option.

3) They could think of something meaningful whether it‚Äôs a handmade gift, sentimental gift or experience that still shows you they care and that it is the best they can do with their financial limitations. I personally love this option.

4 & 5) The last two options they have that I‚Äôve seen is they could lie about getting you something which is worse than option one, OR they could do what your boyfriend did which is set your expectations low so that when they don‚Äôt deliver, they have an out and can blame whatever their excuse is. It‚Äôs manipulative but in a sneaky way and shows that they care more for protecting what you think of them than actually putting in the effort to do something that is well, doable.

instantkarma,f3yx6hy,t1_f3y9sxw,1571260525.0,"Physiologically, we all have impulses. These impulses to touch and grab and make contact happen to people who do take action, and who don‚Äôt. The difference stems from what happened early on in their environment that formed those neural connections early on. Children go through very sensitive developmental periods where they soak up so much like a sponge. If Bob sees Mom and Dad modeling behavior like inappropriate physical contact or even using language that determines this behavior to be acceptable or even encouraged, Bob has a high chance of adopting that behavior or that style of thinking that will likely influence that behavior. A filter develops when behavior is modeled accordingly and moments where parents can detect an impending impulse in the child are best met with consistent intervention to guide them away from undesirable behaviors. This issue is commonly seen in men (women in a smaller group as well) mostly because of societal attitudes towards expectations toward male dominance and superiority to women, creating a sense of entitlement or even cluelessness in regards to the effect it has on others. Children with parents who do not display important behavior in impulse control and altruism often develop conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder. Conduct disorder can in some cases develop into the adult years as antisocial personality disorder. Hope this helps."
Midsommar,f27g8aq,t1_f251mhf,1570037527.0,I learned in therapy the difference between sympathy and empathy. Sympathy is feeling sorry FOR someone and empathy is feeling WITH someone. Empathy is a connective practice where sympathy is more of a hand off. I feel that in this film that it is the defining difference between Christian (sympathy) and the cult (empathy). Christian feels obligated to show her support but is so disconnected from her that he has no capacity to truly empathize. It‚Äôs like he knows logically that it‚Äôs sad when your family dies and the social expectations of a support person but he‚Äôs doing the bare minimum because he doesn‚Äôt have the ability to shift from his own perspective (what I believe is the biggest root cause of most major world issues). The cult is made of people who experienced horrible things in their lives (otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt be in the cult unless born into it) and are much more apt to empathize and delve into deep emotional layers to heal. And their children witness this because they are taught empathy as well.
