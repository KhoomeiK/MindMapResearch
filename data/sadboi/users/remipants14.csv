AskReddit,eu9rnf3,t3_cfgdx7,1563588798.0,"I just wrote a paper on this. First, understand the evolutionary and social reasons for the pain we get when rejected. Being cut out of the group in the early days would be tough to survive. Rejection = death for the early humans. There was an experiment done where a participant will walk into a waiting room with 2 other people. They start throwing a ball between the three of them and then the 2 cut out the third. The participant rated this rejection as significantly painful. Tylenol helped another group of participants. Didn‚Äôt change wether it was a ticking bomb or a rotten fruit. Significant pain. So, understanding that, the second thing you do is, after being rejected, you write all the negative things you‚Äôre feeling about yourself. Then write a rebuttal to each one. Next name 5 good things about yourself in relation to the rejection. Then take a ‚Äúsocial snack‚Äù- scroll through pictures of friends or family, text, call, hang out. Whatever you can handle. Do these things over and over then eventually it will get better."
