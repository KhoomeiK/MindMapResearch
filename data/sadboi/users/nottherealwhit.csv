sex,fpjck4m,t1_fpjchij,1588663621.0,It seems like you didn’t even read my post! I am not dating my ex’s friend whatsoever. I’m dating a GIRL WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM. They don’t know each other. I’m done with you and your silly anti-female agenda tonight. Bye.
sex,fpjbrb9,t1_fpj7g8h,1588662848.0,"Maybe you didn’t know this, but projecting your own issues onto other people doesn’t fix your own.

> You are a disgusting human being. I fully support females that get abused by men mentally and physically but you are not that. I call it how it is not what you want people to see it as.

It’s interesting that you call me this and then immediately say something that an actual disgusting human being would say. Very deflective of you.

You might find it interesting to know that I genuinely don’t care what you have to say, or what anyone else has to say. This was a simple update of a story that ended well. My life is good, and I’m so extremely happy, healthy, and sound-minded. I hope you are able to also take time to reflect and to change your entire mindset, because I know I would never be able to thrive with such a negative and derogatory view on even simple, good things. 

I don’t need to tell my entire life story just to get people like you to accept me or whatever I’ve said here. Here’s what you do need to know, according to this comment and a quick look at your post history:

You might be the exact reason another female feels the same way I felt. You might just be something that makes her fear for her life someday. I pray to God that no female falls prey to your horrendous agenda, and that you find a balanced and safe and healthy understanding of what relationships are. I implore you to never seek the attention of any female. Ever. 

Be better, and be happier. But most importantly, BE DIFFERENT THAN THIS. Not only for your own sake, but for the sake of every woman out there."

relationships,fph2nnj,t1_fph1dhl,1588613886.0,"I just don’t understand where you’re coming with this considering the fault in my relationship was that my boyfriend was being sexually abusive. 

I agree that having mental illness doesn’t give you a free pass to be a piece of shit and not change or learn, but that wasn’t the case here in this relationship. My mistake was dating him, so I left. My mistake was getting married at 20 and in the Mormon church because I’ve been conditioned to do so my entire life, so I left. I feel as though I’ve made very healthy choices in terms of finding what is best for me. 

I never once said I don’t make mistakes or that it’s okay because of my mental health. You are the one who brought it up, not me, and I was clarifying that you can have a mental illness and still be perfectly healthy in the way you navigate through things."

Also, people who are attracted to other human beings can’t help being so, and that’s a fact, relationship or not. I, however, said I was comfortable around him, not that I was attracted to him. Either way, it doesn’t matter because that wasn’t the point of any of the issues."

I think the real issue is that there are not enough genuinely good and safe resources for all in need of aid and treatment with dealing with any case, severe or mild. We shouldn’t even have to be having a discussion about it. We are not being done justice."
