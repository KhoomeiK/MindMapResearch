It sounds like he might be a little less nervous than you are and it might be less stressful than doing it by yourself, especially if there are any sex toy shops near you that cater to lgbt people. One other thing that helps me with dysphoria is wearing boxers over my strap on when topping (so that the dick pokes out through the flap) so that I can only see that and not my junk. Especially with a flesh toned dildo/packer it's a really good gender feel for me (getting a blowjob while wearing it: also a great gender feel and one that's hard to code as a m/f relationship)."
