it doesnt. theyre so hateful about the disorder, they talk about their relationships' bad times and occasionally they speak out on abuse, they always blame it on the disorder rather than accepting the fact that their partner was just a terrible person; and wouldve been that way with or without the disorder.

they all act like either no one is aware of their disorder, or theyre all abusive. they had a bad experience and hate everyone that has to live with this disorder, as if its not hard enough on them.

BPDlovedones,fo8c2ir,t3_g60xl7,1587593712.0,"TL;DR: my s/o did the same, and he still shows that he loves me. All in all, I don't think they do it on purpose, I think they crush really hard and settle into the relationship really fast, so everything seems out of place in that respect. I would definitely say the mocking tone is out of place in any relationship, she shouldn't be trying to scold you unnecessarily either.

My boyfriend was the same way. Its like he was nervous around me, trying to put on his best behavior before getting into the relationship. However, I think back on that a lot in the sense that it really shows that he wanted to be with me, as he's normally very apathetic towards people.

Nowadays (6 months in) when we fight he does do the stonewalling, sometimes its bc he's the one who's upset as I've done something wrong or its bc he thinks I'm overreacting and overthinking it so he leaves me to calm myself down. It bugs me, bc he does nothing to explain himself when I'm upset with him until I've ""calmed down enough."" (There was one instance where I overthought and genuinely made myself angry with him for no reason, and then another where I had to go off about what he'd done that bothered me - in that case he didn't explain himself, but apologized with actions)

We bicker mostly when he's under an influence or not willing to understand what I'm saying. And its always him having a one track mind and then I'm the one who has to fight it out until HE gets over it.

Sometimes when I'm away, we call at night and he gets angry at a video game or something that has nothing to do with me. He'll hang up and fix his problem or just calm himself down and then call me back and explain, and we just go back to the call.

More than anything else, he IS still romantic and he has his cute moments lol. He just expresses it differently now that he's more comfortable and we're more domestic - like any relationship, but it was more sudden of a change with my pwBPD. Like if he's going to the kitchen or into the gas station to grab cigarettes, he'll bring me my favorite snack; or in animal crossing he gives me any gift that he thinks I would like or that he just thought of me when he saw it. He feels worse about himself when we fight than he feels towards me."

relationship_advice,fdzcqcp,t3_enftzz,1578789008.0,"TL;DR - it's superficial to end the relationship over this, you're probably insecure in the relationship now and reaching out for validation in a healthy way is allowed.

\---

I think it's a bit superficial to break it off just because he looks at half-naked models or porn. It's normal (not just guys, everyone). You're in the relationship with him, you get to know him on such a deeper level and you get to enjoy him as more than just eye candy. Those are just images and projections, not emotional or physical attachments.

If he confessed to rather being in a relationship with them or starts comparing their features to yours, as you probably do, then I'd say you have a problem more with toxicity than loyalty.

You may feel crazy or irrational, and believe me, I get that way, too.  Insecurities with ourselves are what's driving us to think that it's a deal-breaker. We just have to keep in mind that the problems we have with ourselves aren't reasons to ask other people to change their habits. In any case, if you feel inadequate to these girls, it's not awful or clingy to seek validation in your relationship in the right way. Like, ""Hey, s/o, I'm not feeling to hot about my appearance, would you remind me what you like about me?""

If he's someone who genuinely wants to grow with you, he may help out. That's just my experience."

""hey, i know it was awkward for me to walk in on you and your boyfriend, and i know that's not how you wanted to come out, but its fine. i got you this lock so that, if you want, we can prevent that from happening again haha. furthermore though, i want you to know that you genuinely have my support - youre my son and i love you - and if anything happens, if he does something you dont like or you need advice for an arguement, you can come to me. i need you to know and understand that, bc there's nothing you can do to disappoint me, and above all else youre my priority""

thats just based on how i  wanted my parents to react to me coming out. i know serious conversations are hard and uncomfortable, but theyre necessary some times, especially after some good ole mortification."

relationship_advice,f91qsw2,t3_e38uqj,1574998380.0,"Hiya.

I think the best way to move forward is to allow some space between you two. He needs to think over what he did, why he did it, and how it's hurt you. And you need to form a new secure and trusting bond, bc of this kind of betrayal it'll feel like starting fron the ground up.

Most of all, you need to know what you want before anything else. You're young and have so much time to find love in life beyond this. You being too dependent could and your want to be with him could be another problem entirely - youre comfortable. Youre scared to let this go bc its all you know and its what youre used to. And thats not entirely a terrible thing.

Give yourselves a week or two of separation. Before anything to do with the survival of the relationship, he needs to KNOW what has been done, not just apologize and acknowledge. He needs to understand. As well as, you need to know what you want. Do you like what was had to the point where you want to give him a shot with new grounding? Or do you want to let it go and find yourself before finding someone new?


This doesn't HAVE to be the end, you have all the power to make it so, however.

I was in SUCH a similar situation recently. I let it go, and it hurt. So much. Im in a new relationship, starting fresh with someone new, and it STILL hurts sometimes. But your choice has to be final, second chances are not something that always works out.

I hope this helps ❤"
