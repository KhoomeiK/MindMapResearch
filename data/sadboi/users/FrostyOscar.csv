Weird thing is half the time these aren't even related to the traumatic event, they're often just random bad or cringey memories from when I was younger, or even worse, hypothetical scenarios where I do something bad. Don't know if anyone else has this or whether it's just me."
MuayThai,f9hqe4q,t3_e52ccb,1575319696.0,"Liked your head movement and you had very effective aggression. As others have already mentioned, you should try and keep your hands up more and use punches to set up kicks. Also, while you have decent punches, you are often focusing too much on throwing them with as much power as possible. This means you're often quite stiff when you're throwing which not only wastes energy but also makes them telegraphed, which a higher-level fighter could use to counter and punish you. This is something almost everyone does in their first fight but should be something to work on in future. 

Overall really solid first fight though. Getting a first-round KO is no small feat, especially at 58kg so you should be super proud!"
