3 unfortunately, dating apps haven't worked out too well. Met a few from one, but usually turned to ghosting

4 is what would be ideal, but hard for me. I dont have a big social circle, so I'm not talking on the phone all day. When a friend does text or call, I'm usually pretty quick to respond back. Habit I've picked up from work. I never understood why being available and responsive when everyone has there phone at their hip all day was bad for talking to women, but I guess I just have to change my perspective.
