I think of it more as trolling for a FP.  Like judging their reaction based upon how they judge my crazy.  If they react in validating way, then they (and I) must be ok, right?"
BPD,f3yx9ge,t1_f3yagyh,1571260560.0,Audiobooks save my life constantly.  I can close my eyes and breathe and get into the story.  Keeps my mind from going negative at a million miles per minute.
raisedbynarcissists,f1rz6tp,t3_dacxac,1569722088.0,My mom even argues about things we agree on.  I learned to shut up and just let her be 'right'.
BPD,f0tkpxl,t3_d6esmt,1568923945.0,"My least favorite word is ""functioning"".  Yes.  I function at times.  Yes I fake functioning.  Just because someone seems to be functioning does not make them healthy.  

The last therapist I saw gave me the impression that since I'm functioning, I don't really need therapy.  That doesn't help my quality of life or help me toward healing.  Things like this make me so grateful for the ability to split."
BPD,ezqpgpk,t3_d1pim5,1568062322.0,"I told my bf the other day when he was starting a new job to take a moment and remember that probably no one there has ever had a girlfriend that cries for an hour just because they love that person.  I was hoping to help him feel a bit more confident and special because I know how hard it is walking into a new job. And now I am probably gonna cry about it again.   

I also love dancing in the grocery aisles sometimes.  The feeling is amazing and wonderful.  

I have considered getting a tattoo with the words: Joy x 10.  A reminder that it isn't all bad.  

I kinda think splitting is a bit of a positive also.  When it's needed to protect yourself from situations that need to be over.  For instance, I got a new job not too long ago that was way more $ and part of my accepting the job was I needed to quit my old job immediately.  I needed to split to be able to do that without the anxiety/guilt/etc that I know I would have felt x10."
