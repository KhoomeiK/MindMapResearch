Endo,fprgc3b,t3_geqqx5,1588853383.0,Got my fingers crossed for you!!
bipolar,fp45urs,t3_gb1zb9,1588292293.0,"Seriously don’t fucking do it I did two days ago and I have such insane regrets. I’ve done it before and it wasn’t as bad but this was not like that, I’m honestly so embarrassed and upset and ashamed of myself because now I have to deal with looking like an idiot for ages and it’s like wearing “IM MENTALLY UNSTABLE” as a massive sign on my forehead. Honestly. Don’t do it."
bipolar,fo674qr,t3_g5suab,1587549032.0,Absolutely stunning. Love this so much!
bipolar2,fo672q9,t3_g5sdrv,1587548972.0,"That’s amazing, I haven’t even managed to do a full week before! Do you track once a day or whenever you think it’s noteworthy etc?"
bipolarart,fnpovgl,t3_g37gmk,1587149305.0,"This isn't usually my kind of style at all, but I actually really love the colours and strokes in this, super nice! :)"
bipolar2,fnn3j54,t1_fniar7b,1587083638.0,"Completely agree. Every now and then, usually at the start of an episode, I have that extremely fleeting I FEE GREAT AND CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS moment, but it rapidly just becomes too much and I can’t keep up with my own thoughts and everything is just overwhelming. It feels more isolating in a way to me. I’m more social when manic, but it’s a sort of fake socialness, yknow? So it feels more isolating cause it’s like people don’t even realise there’s something wrong and it’s just... so frustrating :("
bipolar2,fnhkkll,t3_g1mkd1,1586964117.0,"Could not relate to this more. People romanticise hypomania/mania so much and it's very, very annoying. For the most part I'd rather be one the low side than the up side. Like you say, life and everything even inf your own head just feels so out of control. It feels like everything is going at a million miles an hour and it's hard to keep up. :("
bipolar2,fn6ro88,t3_fzpj9u,1586705995.0,Alllllllll the time. Heavily relate to everything everyone’s said in this thread 😬
bipolar,fmvsdvd,t3_fxmuy0,1586429085.0,I love this so much more than words can express! You have such talent and that’s SUCH a cool idea! :)
drawing,fm9xjzd,t1_fm7wzft,1585878832.0,"You know what, you’re right. It’s a bad habit and idk why I’ve been doing it... consider me changed for the better, you’ve shaken the hold it had on me. I don’t even like emojis... thanks for calling me out internet police stranger :’)"
drawing,fm7a3bc,t3_ftatid,1585818945.0,I love this so much!!! Both your sketches and the coloured one is so gorgeous 😍
bipolar,fm79lt0,t3_ftcqq4,1585818391.0,"This is really gorgeous, I love the colours 😊💕"
bipolar2,fm79deb,t3_ftclii,1585818120.0,"You’re definitely not alone in this, as other people have said. I’ve been getting it a lot recently, having sort of mixed episodes / rapid cycling stuff going on and it can be one hour to the next I’m just unbelievably embarrassed about something I just did or said while I was so low. I do the exact same thing with my partner too and I also feel incredibly guilty about it, it’s like internally watching yourself cause a car crash to happen but not being able to do anything about it. But it’s also incredibly hard because even though those feelings are often quickly put into perspective when you feel a bit better, at the time they’re still absolutely overwhelming and bad for you and that’s valid."
drawing,flvq6vx,t1_flvpt7m,1585529516.0,"I’ll let you off this one time only!👮🏻‍♀️

Seriously though, you clearly have put so much time and patience into getting that good, it’s very admirable, well done!! 😊"
drawing,flvpr8s,t3_frdk99,1585529227.0,"Okay your blending skills are too powerful for this world and are definitely not legal... seriously, your work is amazing. 10/10 would drop my jaw at again. :)"
mentalillness,flu224d,t3_fr3iu3,1585493432.0,"This is how I’ve been too. I get very dissociated, especially spending time alone. Being around other people forces you to acknowledge your presence as a person/individual but alone time makes it easy to just sort of float away. Also feel you on the only looking in the mirror after a while cause your bun starts falling out, sameeee 😂"
bipolar2,flu1qf3,t3_fr5kfw,1585493217.0,Constantly 👌🏻
EDanonymemes,fltqqh4,t3_fqy7sm,1585484023.0,Yikes I’ve had this thought many many times a day for years now.... at least... it’s something... to stay alive for 😬😬😬
bipolar2,flrmy95,t3_fqpews,1585423548.0,"Good luck! Definitely empathise with unhelpful SSRIs, I’ve been stuck on one for months just now and it’s awful. Hope things go well for you 💕"
drawing,flrbsp7,t3_fqimeb,1585417035.0,"I’m very glad you built up the confidence - this is GORGEOUS! Don’t doubt yourself, you’re clearly a very good artist! I love pointillism. Did you use just the one size pen for this?"
mentalillness,flrbf3a,t3_fqm8v6,1585416820.0,This is a good observation. There’s definitely a horrible balancing act that goes into responding to mental health issues - I’m always stuck between “no one is taking this seriously enough” and “it’s not that bad please calm down”...
ptsd,fljun7o,t1_flfokcv,1585227024.0,"I’m so, so sorry that happened to you. It’s bad enough when your own mind makes you doubt the bad things that happened without some external person being an ignorant ass about it and reinforcing that. 

Thank you very much for your reply, I’m trying to figure out how to be strong <3"
ptsd,fljugt7,t1_flgclay,1585226879.0,"I figured it’s a form of dissociation, it’s helpful to know someone else thinks so too, though I’m sorry you have first hand experience. I think during the actual event I dissociated a lot just to get through it all, and now that it’s very much in the past it’s like my brain is decided in drips that it sort of half wants to deal with it all... but at other times it goes back to dissociating and wanting to think it’s simply not true."
ptsd,fljua4a,t1_flhhczc,1585226726.0,This sounds exactly like my situation. Loneliness is definitely a defining feeling of my life at the moment while all this is going on in my head - I have people around but it’s just so isolating to be stuck with these inner haunting memories.
Dissociation,flfnypb,t1_flfn86y,1585111895.0,"Falling backwards is a good term, that's exactly how it feels. It's just like your mind collapses in on itself and you get further and further away from feeling connected to yourself physically. 

For me, I've started to come to terms with the fact it's probably due to some trauma I experienced and it was my mind's way of surviving and getting through it at the time. But that was almost a decade ago, and now I find it's just pretty much constant, out of control, and I'm not really sure how to go about fixing the connection either (a lot of the time I find myself not WANTING to - like I'd rather just float away). Here's hoping we can find a solution... it's a small relief at least to know I'm not the only one feeling like this!"
Dissociation,flfmzvc,t3_fmp2rp,1585111056.0,"This really speaks to me. These days I feel a complete disconnect between mind and body... My ""mind"" feels like me, and my body feels like a completely separate thing from me that I struggle to relate to at the best of times and at the worst feel totally trapped in."
veganfitness,fl7pgw0,t3_fmqpd2,1584906598.0,"You are actual dream body goals, wow - amazing transformation! The amount of work put in here shows loud and clear, congrats!"
Dissociation,fktg0az,t3_fje4l8,1584518116.0,"I definitely feel this regularly. I get it a lot when I wake up recently, I find myself lying in bed staring at my hand with this feeling of absolute confusion and then, like you say, horror, about it being a body in which I physically exist."
Dissociation,fktfvkb,t3_fkkpxs,1584517944.0,This is so painfully accurate to how I feel a lot of the time that it’s almost like I could have written it. I feel like there’s varying levels of being distressed that come along with it... My only hope is that this feeling is temporary and we can get out of it at some point - come to the surface and feel like we are actually part of the same reality as everyone/everything else.
bipolar,fkp4xnp,t3_fji8fn,1584401883.0,Your art always speaks to me when I see it on here and it’s really nice to feel like someone else gets it. Hope you’re okay and take it easy 💕
