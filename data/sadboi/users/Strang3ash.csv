I like to drink, there‚Äôs no lie about that but from my experience it does trigger episodes especially if it‚Äôs the point of 5+ drinks. 
Since I started lithium I‚Äôve limited my drinks to three, after that I can kiss my whole day goodbye because I‚Äôm extremely hungover, depressed with a bad migraine even if I only drank beer. It drives me nuts but my life is more stable with lithium so the choice is clear get drunk or stay mentally healthy."

Also you have a valid point about it being unfair to keep the people close to me in the loop. My reasoning behind it is that I‚Äôm almost 30 years old.
