China_Flu,fp8s1k0,t1_fp6t4ib,1588401099.0,"Obviously they screwed up, tried to cover it up, and screwed up the cover up in an attempt to save face, dragging the WHO down in the process. But so did every country that the virus infected, including America.  Dr. Fauci & the CDC were still telling Americans that the seasonal flu was a bigger concern than Covid-19 in February...and that wearing masks was a bad idea...truly bizarre. The stickiest stories about Covid are still mostly about Trump, and not about China covering up their early knowledge of human to human transmission and their shipping of garbage PPE and flawed test kits to the West. Trump is the big lightning rod that attracts the most criticism.

The fact that American MSM still continues to treat the notion that a Corona virus could have originated in a Wuhan level 4 bio lab that did research on bat viruses as a ""right wing/Trumpist"" theory... instead of treating it as a serious line of inquiry... tells me all I need to know about the ""don't piss off China"" playbook they are operating from as part of multinational media companies.

BTW, if the WHO's credibility is ""ruined"" you'd never know it if you looked at the MSM: CNN and NYT still repeat every word the WHO says....Hollywood & the music industry put on a fundraiser concert for the WHO just a few weeks ago to make up for Trump pulling their funding. The WHO and Tedros are treated like victims instead of Chinese collaborators.

So, the ""official"" media sources are legitimizing the WHO and the globalist mouthpieces (like Gates) are deflecting criticism of China. Like a bunch of trained monkeys...everyone knows what to do without even being told. Only time will tell if the world pulls all their manufacturing out of China. I have my doubts. My bet is that China has enough leverage around the world - being a major holder of foreign debt- that they will manage to do enough damage control to come out ahead in all this while we bicker amongst ourselves. Without strong global leadership (usually led by America, but now non-existant) China can now openly divide and conquer."

China_Flu,fp56112,t1_fp4y8t9,1588317499.0,"I did a freelance project for a well known athletic shoe company that did all their manufacturing in China. Their marketing director filled me in on how the company would spend years designing and market testing new footwear, set the production lines in China up to produce the product, only to see knock-off products hitting the streets while the company was still evaluating the demo models. The owners of the factories in China stole the designs and created copies that they could export on the black market. And they denied doing it.

 If you extrapolate that kind of disregard for legal contracts, laws, norms, and conventions into all aspects of China's global behavior you'll see just what kind of threat China is. The west generally plays by the rules and honors legal contracts, while the Chinese see these as mere pieces of paper. The idea that they are doing better because we are not focusing on ourselves isn't wrong, but there IS a much more devious set of planning going on with the Chinese Communist Party that many in the West are not able or willing to publicly acknowledge. 

They have plans to become a global superpower and you will see it come to pass in your lifetime. China's Belt and Road initiative is expanding their sphere of influence far beyond their borders. And this sphere will continue to expand.

China does not share the same values or interests in global security and global cooperation that we have in the West and if we keep believing that they are some type of reasonable ally, or pretend that they are not bad actors on the global stage we do so at our own peril. If anything you will see the West start to copy the Chinese Communist Party's practice of monitoring their population and controlling dissent."
China_Flu,fp51txv,t1_fp4wi9f,1588313619.0,"Yes. They have methodically studied us - both inside our country as students and businessmen, and inside their own country as business partners and they are brilliantly using all of our strengths - as a free market economy and a democracy who respects the rule of law - to undermine our position in the world while enhancing their own. 

Trump made a stab by demanding better trade policies, but at this point it's too little too late. By not collaborating with our allies in Europe and Asia to demand better behavior from China, his trade policies and criticisms of China do not carry the weight and global cache necessary to reign China in. 

The Chinese Communist Party also know how to quash any criticism of China by both economic leverage and by manipulating our social justice movement to help equate all anti-China rhetoric with racism and xenophobia. We are being played with carrots and sticks by true masters of manipulation."

They can improve a little, but there are limits.

Also, as the victim, it sounds like you have not drawn proper boundaries for what you are  willing to accept/not accept in terms of her behavior. I was in a similar (but not so extreme) marriage for 20 years and it was a real soul sucking experience. ( I wish I had left her years ago. )

You simply need to decide if you want to spend your life being abused this way, or if you believe you deserve a BETTER life. Marriage counseling is not going to fix this IMHO.
