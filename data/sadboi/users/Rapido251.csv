depression,fp2dae7,t3_ga5xvj,1588259757.0,"Honestly, talent in most cases is just about passion, dedication and the will not to give up, but... When you start a new hobby, your depression can affect your thoughts about it completely. Even though there are certain steps you have to take to improve, depression will make it a thousand times harder. I know, because I have the same issue now just like you.  


Before my serious depression I managed to reach the top 5% in simracing. Even though it had it's own painfully hard periods, I could manage to improve myself over time. But as everything else, it got affected by depression. I've given up this hobby, my passion towards motorsports which I loved since I was 5 years old.  


But now, I found a new sport where I found my passion, for a short time... I ended up getting furious about every single mistake I made. And every failure made me see only how poorly I'm playing compared to the ""talented"" ones. After just a month I reached the mental breakdown state because of this frustration. All I'm doing is just overanalyzing myself and my mistakes. I cannot see the successes anymore, just the painful mistakes. Despite I'm trying to control my thoughts and my mind, I can't help it. I lost my interest in a hobby once again because of this disgusting illness."

depression,fnalu3x,t1_fnal5fb,1586799732.0,"I have a girlfriend, but our relationship is complicated sometimes, but I don't really have friends who would understand my feelings. I've tried to find some communities where I could belong, but most of the times I was too scared to start a conversation with someone. In rare cases I just got simply rejected.  


In fact I'm really missing the support from someone else in my life, but I feel like it's selfish from me to expect anyone to care about my problems and lend me a hand in hard times."

I don't think so. Patrick is a Canadian-born American player. This is very distant from Ronnie."

snooker,fmov9vv,t3_eml5xb,1586269160.0,"I was thinking about the same. Even though I started playing 2 months ago and I improved some, I feel like my improvement is not going like I want to. Still struggling with potting, so as long as I can't even pot 85% of my shots I don't think it worths getting into cue ball control and positional play. Currently my highest break stands on 16, but it was more luck than skill.

I'm trying to keep up my motivation with saying ""talent is just dedication, passion and will to improve"" in these kind of sports, but in the past 1-2 weeks I started giving up this idea. I literally don't even know what I'm doing wrong. If I'm just bad at the game or the lack of ""effective"" practice or it's something to do with my mentality.

I've literally spent my last week with looking for some articles, videos or tips from coaches about every basic knowledge. Starting from aiming techniques, through trying to find some drills for rookies (I couldn't find any), ending with some youtube videos.

On the other hand I feel like I'm completely on the wrong track. After reaching high levels in one of my hobbies I know how developing your skills looks and feels like, but in snooker it doesn't feel the same way."
snooker,fmb87x3,t3_fsao15,1585920829.0,I would love to see a jump shot with that apple. Would it splash into pieces or the cue just pierce through the apple? :D
snooker,fmaw5xd,t1_fmavpa5,1585910204.0,"But to give some advice from my personal experience:

* A cue (if he doesn't have one yet)
* A cue case
* Any snooker course book (+ gadgets optional) that could help him improve (you need to know what he's been practicing actually)
* A souvenir signed by his favourite player (you can reach them usually by fan mail)
* If he's playing regularly: a top quality tournament ball set (it's very expensive)
* Access for video courses, like Nic Barrow's coaching lessons
* A cue case

These things came into my mind right now. Also, your support towards his passion about snooker always a great gift. :)"

DetroitBecomeHuman,fcmuhtp,t3_ehqibu,1577792877.0,"It looks like Epic Games has serious issues with their game. With the newest driver Detroit and Tetris Effect kept crashing all the time, so I had to go back to a version that is a month old (talking about RX 5700 which is a fairly new card). After a while Detroit just crashed randomly every 2 hours."
calculus,fbzd6tu,t3_ef817g,1577242793.0,"Interestingly enough I found that I have my best ideas while dreaming, whether it's about math or programming (or anything else). So I would say that it's not just normal, but incredibly helping."

By the way, Tetris Effect also started crashing after update."
F1Game,f7jexkh,t3_dk1wip,1573776169.0,"So after a while it seems like I solved problem. All I needed to do is not drive as fast as I can immediately because it basicaly made me overdrive the car. So I did the same procedure like when I'm learning a new track. I've started slowly, coasting into the turns and tried to hit the apex. After I felt confident enough I've started picking up the pace, my braking distances became lower and I kind of got used to the handling model like that. I've done it for maybe two hours and I could drive like in the previous games that I mentioned. I'm still strugling a little bit with hitting the braking point just right, but this method made me jump from a 75% AI level to around 105%. Also tweaking the brakes a little bit helped me as well."
F1Game,f4a8mav,t1_f49yfg0,1571490548.0,"With Codemasters F1 games I played many times since 2010, but never did frequently until 8-10 months ago. Since then I've been playing with F1 2017 and F1 2019 a lot, sometimes 4-6 hours on daily basis.

PS: I usually played with a gamepad, but now I kind of decided to play more seriously and thought it would be a good idea to use my wheel for this game as well."
F1Game,f49wkqp,t1_f49viwi,1571485234.0,"2019 version. Even though the Physics improved a tons, I still feel like the car doesn't respond the way I want. Oversteer comes exceptionally sudden. I think I should get used to the physics with doing 100-200 kilometers on low pace, like when I have to learn a new track. :D"
