ACPocketCamp,fqzd5ur,t3_glkqdl,1589764884.0,"Thanks for asking this.  I'm fairly new to the game and was wondering too.   I've been saving my grapes so I can sell them in bunches of 5, or 3 if I'm low on space a lot at a time so as many friends can get them as possible.  On alternate days I've just been selling fruits cheap. I figure if I can get 20 it's still double and I sell a lot that way.  I noticed most of the friends that buy them sell fruit for 100 each. 

I like to buy the foreign fruits and materials the most.  I buy rare bugs and fish like red snapper a lot. If there are request I've run out of I'll buy them from friends if the have them at a reasonable price. 

Also, I never know what to price things.  What I can sell them for or what they're worth to the villagers?   And if friends really overprice things, do people buy them to help them or just avoid buying them?"

I got sick early March.  I went to urgent care a week later due to fluid in my lungs and shallow breathing.  My pets stopped eating and one was diagnosed with assumed lymphoma.  She's since  magically recovered.  Two members of my family and 3 of my sons friends had the same sickness (just before lock down).  I had sharp chest pains. My heart rate was elevated and I asked them at urgent care about that before it was a known symptom.  They said I drank too much coffee (I don't drink coffee).  I had a terrible cough for over 2 months.  I'm still coughing mildly.  My symptoms would improve somewhat and then get bad again as many have described. 

Now I'm extra scared because if it wasn't it and it was something else that wrecked my lungs, then maybe I'm at higher risk if I were to get it now.  There's just too many coincidences for me to completely accept the negative antibodies test."

I'll be feeling happy I did so well and then it drops and it's like a slap.   Those are the only times I've dropped without some other reason like playing really badly or having someone blame me for losing.   Two or 3 times were wins on torb when I did really well and I thought maybe people didn't like torb so they reported me.  The last game was just yesterday.  I was on tracer and I've never done so well on her. One death, 4 golds and a win.  I immediately dropped to 3 when it was over.   I wonder if people report someone for being good assuming cheating.   I play healers most, so it's rare I play dps and makes it seem even more unusual to drop after one dps game where I do well."

I read more about the Abbott study for their antibodies test.  They eliminated one person who tested negative for antibodies when they were positive for corona virus.  They were taken out because they are immune compromised.   I'm also an immune compromised person.  So, it will be interesting to see if they do a study on the effectiveness on that group of people.  I don't develop antibodies to the MMR vaccine, so maybe there's a correlation. 

Sorry, I'm just speculating and I don't know anything, the same as any one else.

OverwatchUniversity,fpx9zgz,t3_gfu55v,1588978542.0,"Just keep in mind there are certain picks that will get flamed the moment you pick them, and widow is one.   Even if they don't tell you to switch right away, they're watching you closely.  Usually they specifically watch the kill feed and if you're not there enough they'll tell you to switch.  Even if you have gold elims, but are hitting body shots and someone else is getting the final kill.  Sometimes they don't even watch that and will just rage you if the team is losing. I was having a rather excellent game as widow and our junk rat was basically afk, and I mean actually sitting frequently and not moving.  Who got raged at?  Me as Widow.

I'm an ex dva main.  Over 500 hour on her and in plat when I played her a lot.  Now I just pick her and sometimes I've literally been screamed at.  One time they actually apologized and said they are just used to people not knowing how to play her.  I actually hardly play her  anymore because I really hate the toxicity.  I also barely play Widow for the same reason.  It shouldn't get to me in a qp game, but it does.  

I must say though, one time someone raged at me when I was first learned dva and they actually helped me a lot by pointing out things I wasn't doing, but I should be.   I've tried giving advice nicely and that alone usual triggers people who think they know it all.  I wish people would just offer advice rather than get angry.

I just can't get over whatever it is, so I worry about the what ifs.  Which is what everyone is doing who gets sick now.

What you need to focus on is getting better.  Do whatever you can to boost your immune system, breathing exercises...  Even if it doesn't help, feeling proactive can help mentally.

I got sick March 3rd and was in bed with a fever and feeling extremely exhausted for 2 days, which was how long my husband was sick a couple days before me.  On day 3 I thought I was over it fever was down and I felt better, only for it to come back that night worse.  That's when the coughing and lung problems started.  I called a few times to try and be tested, but it was when you still needed to have traveled or had to be sever to get a test.  About 8 days later I felt fluid in my lungs and it made breathing harder and sharp pains, but I had no ride to the clinic and it didn't feel like an emergency, though in hindsight I think after being told so many times that I didn't need a test and I wasn't that sick because my fever wasn't over 104 that I just didn't want to hear that again and stayed home when I should have gone in. That lasted a couple days.  When I went in to be checked out a couple days after they again treated me like nothing was wrong and sent me home with a bill and what felt like a slap on the wrist.  I kept coughing and having shortness of breath.  A lot on anxiety and sleepless nights.  My doctor diagnosed walking pneumonia and put me on antibiotics.  One night I felt extremely weak and was feeling fant and like I wasn't getting enough oxygen. I probably had a panic attack.  I went into the urgent care and they again said I was fine, but agreed that it's likely I had covid-19. I had a week, about week 6, without a cough or any symptoms and was excited to be over it.  Then for no reason my cough came back and my lungs feel weird and I still am weak and feel dizzy from time to time. It's much milder now and I only cough a few times a day, but I'm so ready for that to end.  The way it comes in waves you can never relax.  I think I got hit harder than my husband and it's lasted so long because I have an autoimmune disorder."

It helped a little to do what I could whether it helped or not, steamy showers, drinking lots of warm tea, vitamins, breathing exercises. Anything that gave me a sense of control."
Vent,foh9n44,t3_g72gh8,1587762330.0,"I'm so sorry.  My mom is in her 80s, living at home still. She's healthy and full of life.  We've been running her errands for her and she hates it. She's always been independent with lots of projects.  I'm worried when things open up that she'll get it then.  She's in a small town, so maybe there's less chance.   When people discounted it because those that died were just old people it infuriated me.  They're people still full of life with family and friends who love them."

So, we should say anyone asymptomatic with a positive nasal swab just inhaled it and they're good to go about life?  It makes no sense.  The reports give so little information.  That's why I still don't know what to believe.   No one knows for sure.  What I see is a week after I got sick all 3 of my animals, who've never been sick and are young and healthy, all got sick. It's weird."

Is there a study to confirm this?  No one will even test my dog for canine coronavirus even though she's got the same symptoms because they won't even consider she could even have that during this."

I USED THE GROUP UP OPTION TO PLAY WHATEVER AND WAS ALARMED AT HOW MANY GAMES QUED UP WERE TITLED SOMETHING LIKE, ""BRONZE SILVER COMP THROW MATCH. DROP SR""  AND THEN THE GAMES THAT I PLAYED TONIGHT, HOLY HELL, THERE WERE PEOPLE IN THERE WITH BETTER TRICKS THAN IN PLAT GAMES.  IT WAS COMPLETE DESTRUCTION. SO MANY PLAYERS CLEARLY WITH HIGHER SKILLS THAN THEIR RANK.  BRONZE REINS ON FIRE THE ENTIRE MATCH. SILVER MCCREE KILLING EVERYONE HE SEES INSTANTLY.

COVID19positive,fo9ai48,t3_g6e534,1587614407.0,"Yes, everyone thinks I'm crazy, including the vet.  A week after I got sick my two cats and dog stopped eating.  We bought 6 bags a food and countless wet foods between them all. They're all pigs and eat a ton if they can so it was very unusual.   The cats got better. Our dog, who didn't leave my side when I first got sick still isn't well.  Her lymph nodes are very swollen and the vet thinks she has lymphoma.   I've not heard any more reports about pets getting sick, so idk maybe the timing was just a coincidence.  I wonder if they also got it."

Starting to feel bubbling in my lungs this week. Don't google that, ugh.  Still having sharp pains in chest/lungs.  Coughing. I really want this to be over.  Sorry you've had a tough road and hope you feel better soon."
COVID19positive,fnzxkiy,t3_g4p1z9,1587402485.0,"I'm so sorry!   When I went in they dismissed me too because of my high heart rate. Asking me if I drank a lot of coffee or if I was anxious.  Their tone was very dismissive and those questions came after asking me about my thermometer and if it was a cheap one from the drug store and if I calibrated it.  I was so sick and so scared and I felt like I was charged for a slap on the wrist.  They didn't ask me anything, just said I was fine and go home.  I appreciate all the doctors and nurses for there work and sacrifice, but I'm sorry, some of them are extremely rude.  Over the course of a month of being sick I had 4 that treated me so badly for even thinking I might actually be sick with this!  I'm was so massively grateful to the two health care workers who were so kind and so helpful.  After being treated badly it's so nice just to be heard!"

Do you think it's fine if some people die as a trade off to no shut down?  Do you want everything open now?  Are you not aware that a gradual opening is being planned already?  Do you plan now to stay home for 14 days since you may have exposed yourself to the virus increasing the risk for essential workers and their families?   Do you have no compassion for those that have died? Please stay the F home.

Coronavirus,fnprfco,t1_fnpcpns,1587150622.0,No one would even discuss it at all if the headline didn't grab their attention.  Let's not forget it's a business and if even some click it because they're curious than they've earned something to keep reporting.  If you only needed to read a headline to learn everything than there'd be a lot less reporting.

Coronavirus,fnp7fni,t1_fnp3drq,1587140540.0,I took a journalism class ages ago and the first thing we learned was how to write a headline to get attention.   That's the entire point of it.  No one is going to stop and read something that doesn't grab their attention.  The headline isn't the news.  It's just to get you to read the the actual information. It's skewed misleading to grab attention since newspapers began.

Ppl rage quit way more now.  It's even rare that people will stay in a game long enough to play a second match with the same people in arcade and that used to be the norm. Sometimes playing 4 or more games with the same people. Now everyone leaves and re que. Win or lose."
