DoesAnybodyElse,f3pt5dq,t3_dhibv1,1571064613.0,"I‚Äôve read through a lot of the comments and as a parent I would like to respond to some.
‚ÄúDid you brush your teeth‚Äù - 
1. We know you brushed your teeth - but we also would like to converse with you and some don‚Äôt know how to start the conversation- good morning might work but sometimes we only get a nod or a grunt 
2. For teens out there - think of it this way - for 10 years - I‚Äôm gonna say that again because it‚Äôs important- 10 years parents have taken care of you closely - fixed your food - bathed you , clothed you - put you bed - checked in on you while you were Sleeping - woken you up and then it all stops - we are no longer needed - we know nothing - and are hated - we haven‚Äôt changed - we started off helping you brush your teeth and reminding you to and it‚Äôs hard to stop something you have been doing for 10 or more years 
For the driving - I have to tell my kids to drive safe 
Of course they are going to but it makes me feel better to know I told them to drive safe - should they get in an accident and I DIDNT tell them - I would feel so guilty - yes that is a selfish thing to do but I feel responsible for everything they do because for 16 years I have helped them 
Anyway I know it‚Äôs annoying im just saying maybe one time think about why someone says something to you  especially when it comes from parents."

Mainly though she made everyone feel stupid and she said so do their face. I left and took a job making 30k less. I have little to no stress in this new job. I laugh every day and actually lol forward to work each day. But because of the large drop in pay my savings account is depleted because of past bills. I have no money at the end of each pay period and therefore have no money saved. I have no money to do fun things - I can‚Äôt go to the movies or go shopping even the thrift store I can‚Äôt afford. Grocery shopping is getting only what is necessary- no extras. I often think of why I left and question my choice. I don‚Äôt know the answer. I‚Äôm going to talk with my boss next month as it will be a year and maybe I‚Äôll get a raise but I‚Äôm sure I won‚Äôt make what I used to.
