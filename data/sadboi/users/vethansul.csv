the other thing is this happens even when i’m alone and just by myself so there is no possibility of anyone being a threat. it also varies; sometimes i’ll actually have a good day when i’m happy, but the next day i’m physically unable to be happy. then there’s the thing where i’ll really be into a show and be so excited and into it like i’ve found the source of happiness, and then i will fall from that peak down *hard* and it will feel like a completely uninteresting and boring thing to me that i don’t even care about anymore. it’s less about “oh no i might get hurt” (bc i definitely have those moments too but they feel different) and more about “i feel so great but from repeated experience i know for a fact the fall will be equally intense and that’s why i’m scared of getting excited and happy in the first place” if that makes sense"

I don’t know in what way you meant it when you said it, but it came across jokingly as if to say “lol, it’s like a mantis with schizophrenia!” which is extremely disrespectful not only because her behavior is absolutely normal, as is mantises eating other mantises. It has nothing to do with mental illness. It’s part of their instincts and expected. Mantises are also not domesticated animals because you can’t really domesticate insects. They are kept as pets but have all their feral instincts as they need them to survive. I don’t know if you’re really a health professional and for all I know this may have been miscommunication due to lack of tone but you might want to elaborate more early on. And nothing for nothing but I’ve had horrible experiences with some health professionals so that alone isn’t an argument for me unfortunately. P. aeruginosa is a very highly skilled hunter species and as such they are difficult to handle. I like poking fun at it but that doesn’t mean something is wrong with her. She is probably the healthiest mantis I’ve had and I can still love her even though she is difficult to keep. If you’re interested in insects I recommend looking more into it because their behavior and “psychology” so to speak is vastly vastly different from other domestic pets. They have behaviors that we might easily interpret as “bad” or “wrong” through our human lens but if we really want to understand and appreciate them for what they are we need to interpret their behaviors through their own. Mantises don’t like to be pet, they don’t like to have company or play and not all of them tolerate being handled. They eat their food alive and will eat their spouses sometimes even during reproduction. And that’s just something we need to accept and respect."

I should also add that I’m not from the US so buying from US sites means I’ll pay at least 20-40$ just for the shipping. I might also have to pay more at the customs, which is why I tend to go to eBay for these things :( (I found they sell him for quite cheap on omnimestore, almost suspiciously cheap, but it says the “USA stock” isn’t available anymore and it will be shipped from “overseas” and wording like that always makes it suspicious to me unless it’s clearly stated that it’s still the genuine product by DF.

I think Goku’s greatest weakness is his social obliviousness. And he is a lot more selfish than he lets on; he isn’t the “I’ll take whatever I want with no consideration for others” kind of selfish which is why it’s deceiving sometimes. His selfishness is the “I only care about my own goals and interests but try to be a nice guy by not intentionally hurting others if I can help it”. Maybe on Vegeta he may have been considered a good dad, because their lifestyle and upbringing and culture is SO vastly different. But on Earth, he is a trash dad. When he gave the senzu bean he may not have had bad intentions for Gohan, but his lack of empathy, understanding and consideration for the life of EVERYONE else on the planet is what makes him selfish here. And his death by Cell amplifies how he really didn’t know Gohan as his son and a person; yes, Gohan did push past his potential, Goku was right there, but what he didn’t account for was that Gohan also is barely a TEEN, he’s developing and can get cocky and careless, much more than a more self-aware adult would. And since Goku also likes to drag on fights and get cocky, it is not surprising that Gohan has similar traits. Gokus lack of self-awareness and actual knowledge of his son’s personality really was what messed things up. And what I personally find worse is, on a more realistic level, Gohan blames himself even though it’s not his fault that ANYTHING happened or didn’t happen. Goku does kinda apologize and says he’s proud before taking the Cell balloon away, but what he really should do is say “I FUCKED UP I MADE ASSUMPTIONS AND IVE PROBABLY TRAUMATIZED YOU FOR NO REASON AT ALL, NONE OF THIS IS YOUR FAULT AND THE REASON IM GOING TO DIE NOW IS BECAUSE I NEED TO MAKE UP FOR THE ENORMOUS MISTAKES IVE MADE. goodbyeeee soooonnn”"

His saiyan mentality is actually so dominant and the more you piece things together the more you realize he actually has a lot of battle smarts and even his dumb decisions actually make sense going by his logic. Really great way to capture how alien he is without even forcing him to look or act alien.

awwnverts,fou7lfj,t1_fou3ebr,1588078234.0,"Let me give you some useful links that I think every mantis owner should have bookmarked regardless of subspecies! [Here](https://www.mantidsandmore.com/care/sickness/) it lists various diseases and issues and gives a few tips. [This site](https://mantismonarch.wordpress.com/health/) is similar but has some more additional info as well as the honey treatment and I highly recommend this site even if your mantis doesn’t have any issues (yet!)

For anyone curious I will copy paste the treatment:

>What to do for a sick mantis:

>If your mantis becomes sick due to bad food or has an infection…

> 1. Remove ill mantis from other mantid. Place into separate sterile enclosure with paper towels on substrate.

> 2. Give mantis diluted honey mixture (1 part honey 5-9 part distilled water) either dipped on skewer or dipped on feeder. Honey has natural anti-septic, antibacterial and other beneficial properties to help your mantis get well.

> 3. Give the mantis plenty of fluids. You can give mantis water via dropper directly. Make sure you only use distilled, filtered, spring water, or well water. If you are not sure of the ailment, it’s best to remove variables (such as water impurities).

> 4. Make sure to get rid of tainted feeders insects. Change out feeder’s media often to avoid problems with feeders.

> 5. Clean mantis’ regular enclosure thoroughly to reduce risk of reinfection. **(My own personal note here: clean it with vinegar, then a damp towel to wipe off the residue and let it dry thoroughly, in the sun for example. Vinegar will kill any bacteria or fungi and is very useful. Under no circumstances should you use chemical cleaners, your mantids might die from even a small amount due to their size and sensitivity.)**
> 6. Make sure mantis is getting the proper ventilation, temperature, humidity, has a set feeding schedule, has access to drinking water, and anything else needed for that particular species.

> 7. If you’re religious or a mantis, pray."

awwnverts,fotvnjg,t1_foths4k,1588067757.0,"Nope. Those black dots are called pseudopupils and are basically an optical illusion. Mantises do however have stereo vision much like flies with compound eyes, which means you never really know what they’re truly “looking” at since they kinda look at everything all the time - but usually if you’re facing a mantis head-on (or she snaps her head around and *she* faces you head-on) then you can be pretty sure you are in focus since they see most clearly at the full-frontal. I do think she can see me from this angle, but possibly very blurry, because the sides of the eyes are more of a motion sensor in case there is relevant movement, the mantis can turn her head to face it directly to determine whether it’s food for example. Let me blow your mind even more and say they technically have 5 eyes - 3 on top of their heads!"

You can’t just say “but it’s so nice out! It’s the perfect picnic weather!” and think that’s a valid argument if you argue like this every single day all the damn time. You have to swallow the pill and stay the fuck indoors and endure being a little bit uncomfortable for crying out loud."
dankmemes,fonmu6j,t1_fonla6l,1587922512.0,I don’t really know what your point is but I didn’t say commit atrocities. You’re taking a quote out of context here and it’s not what this post is about at all
dankmemes,fonkewj,t1_fonk035,1587921181.0,"Hey, imagine not everyone is from the US for just a hot minute and that everyone is getting paid here SUFFICIENTLY to stay the fuck indoors, no one is forcing you to take tests, stay inside 24/7 or not go on walks or grocery shopping. People here are protesting sports events being cancelled and kindergartens being closed because who cares if old people die from this. Who cares if sick people die. I want to play football. I’m young and privileged and want to be able to get wasted at bars and this isn’t fair. Wah."

awwnverts,fohd8fw,t1_fofjt0z,1587764010.0,"She might really just not be into honey, or maybe once she grows up. 

Yesss, it’s so goofy and cute when mine does it too! And they’re so oblivious about it!

Oh yeah, I forgot about those! It’s always good to start with smaller and easier stuff to get a feeling for raising them and avoiding big errors with the bigger guys. Either way, they’re honestly all fun to have and watch! :D"
awwnverts,foevs2v,t1_foc23ak,1587716485.0,"Hm, all of mine usually love honey, but maybe it depends on the type and whether it’s organic or not?

Aw, that’s cute! Some Hierodula mantids seem to have a tic where they keep a leg in the air and forget about it, usually when they’re halfway through their total molts I noticed! Spelta still does it and I love to just boop her foot from underneath and she doesn’t even care.

Edit: oh and as for beetles, I highly recommend flower beetles because they’re day active and pretty big! There’s also more info on them online than some of the other ones and they’re pretty easy to keep. Also they do the tippytap of their feets every time before they take off, it’s super cute! [Here’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/awwnverts/comments/b4ie93/this_is_the_last_thing_i_saw_before_i_died/) a video of my first one! Feel free to PM me if you have any questions about them!"
awwnverts,foerhkj,t1_focj9bc,1587712270.0,"They do be lovin’ the honey! The best is the organic kind, it is extremely rich in nutrients for them and helps them stay healthy. Also a great treat to calm them down (for example if you spooked them and they’re doing a defensive pose, just poking their mouth with a tiny bit of honey and they instantly forget everything, I love it)"
awwnverts,foer4lw,t1_foe7j35,1587711928.0,set those babies free
awwnverts,foc05ee,t1_fobwei0,1587665639.0,"Have you tried handling her when she’s like really full? Hierodulas vary in their temperament but the ones I’ve had before didn’t mind too much! Sometimes it helps to just let them climb out on you and reward them with honey (careful though, if you offer it on like a spoon and then take it away they’ll lean down thinking there’s some on your hand and might accidentally bite you). My girl Spelta is supposedly one of the more aggressive species but she is honestly so chill, I really love handling her.

I love it when inverts do the tippytaps!! I’ve had beetles that did that too and it is sooo cute!"
awwnverts,fobg8ff,t1_fobd1xa,1587659471.0,"I have a hygrometer and my mantids are in plastic containers/terrariums with enough holes for ventilation but also to keep some moisture in, so that’s why I came to that conclusion. Generally I think a little more humidity is better than too little anyway. But I definitely recommend a hygrometer/thermometer for anyone really, but especially if anyone is as forgetful as me because sometimes I don’t even remember if I sprayed them lol"
awwnverts,fob6xxr,t1_fob04kk,1587656770.0,Awww!! Thank you! She’s a sweetheart <3 also I *love* your username
awwnverts,foary38,t1_foapa5f,1587651491.0,Ooh!! Can’t wait to see her grown up! My Hierodula girl says Hi!!
awwnverts,foaropn,t1_foapbeu,1587651381.0,"To be fair the only thing that bothered me was the “how sad they live in a small cage” part, because it implies that it’s somehow wrong to keep them that way. That’s kinda like if I commented on a photo of a bunch of ferrets fighting over food “how sad they don’t have enough to eat, don’t they get fed well?” without knowing that ferrets like to play-fight even if there’s enough to eat. It could just be that tone doesn’t translate well over the internet, but especially with mantids (which are almost all opportunistic cannibals) the last thing we’d want here is people putting them together because they seem lonely. Didn’t mean to attack ya or anything"
awwnverts,foaavei,t1_foa9sdj,1587643393.0,"Oh the honey thing is a brilliant idea actually! Yeah, that definitely makes things a lot safer and you hit several birds with one stone because the honey is good for the flies and therefore good for the mantis too, it keeps them away from them, makes it easier to catch them, and the mantis can also nibble at the honey.

The cricket thing is a serious issue exactly because of that. The problem with flies can be that sometimes during a mantis’ molt, they might climb on or disturb in another way, and if you’re super unlucky your mantis might drop and will die with a good 85% chance. I think your enclosures are plenty big though so I think you’ll be fine!

Another thing for anyone curious is I noticed nymphs need around 10-15% more humidity than what most websites actually tell you (mostly referring to the easier ones to keep with more complex shapes, like Ghosts and Flower mantids) because I’ve had the perfect temperature for a nymph once and she lost one of her legs which thankfully grew back!"
awwnverts,foa639u,t3_g653te,1587640535.0,I **swear** I’ve seen this post here before by the actual OP but I can’t seem to find it. Just like a few months ago. Would be great if we could credit them :/
awwnverts,foa5hwx,t3_g63ycp,1587640067.0,"NYYOOOOOOOOOOMMM.

I love how s/he just stopped right after that “finish line”."
awwnverts,foa5bkn,t3_g61mpg,1587639923.0,"They do look very cute! I’d personally like to emphasize though that even though Ghost mantises are relatively less cannibalistic, you should separate them as soon as possible and watch out anyway. A low chance of death is still a chance of death and especially if you’re starting to bond with them it can be heartbreaking.

Also I’m not sure if I saw that correctly but generally it’s best only to give your nymphs the amount of food they’ll actually eat because those flies can harm a mantis during its molt, but OP seems well informed so I’m sure the excess of flies remaining were released after a while or something like that."
awwnverts,foa4vhe,t1_fo969ox,1587639579.0,"For real though. I think mantises are happiest when they’re completely alone with only food. They have absolutely no social skills and even P. paradoxa nymphs don’t do a lot when they’re together as nymphs. They don’t play or whatever, if anything they keep an eye on each other lest someone starts feeling hungry.

This is such a classic type of “interpreting life through the human eye” comment lol"
awwnverts,foa49f6,t3_g5rp9k,1587639098.0,For anyone being apprehensive and wondering if the lobster was released: I just checked out the original post and OP says he was biosampled and then released back into the water!
awwnverts,foa3jub,t1_fo5eeh9,1587638649.0,"This is really not offensive at all, it’s kind of like when cats clean themselves rigorously after being pet for a while. Kinda like you’d wanna wash your hands if someone held your hand too long. A lot of bugs clean themselves just like this all the time so it really has nothing personal to do with it :)"
awwnverts,foa3135,t3_g67uho,1587638344.0,"I have basically no bee knowledge other than the few common things but part of me wonders how the bees felt about this? And if petting them even feels good for them or actually might be harmful? I’d be super interested if there are any experts here who can say if this is a good thing to do at all?

But the less cynical side of me says this is so adorable and the fact that they even flew close to the person and weren’t aggressive is incredible. The fact that bees can learn to ignore their survivalist instincts to avoid and attack when in danger is very fascinating. How much about that is human interpretation I do not know but my mantises for example don’t understand the concept of being pet and I don’t want to harass them to find out either."
awwnverts,foa1ilu,t3_g6dxi9,1587637370.0,"She deserves it.

What mantis is she? Hierodula or maybe Sphodromantis family? Or a shield mantis? She looks adorable!"
awwnverts,foa1e1t,t3_g6dxpn,1587637280.0,I’m going to cry. He looks so precious and if the parts with the antennae are actually his head then he literally looks like the insect version of a Yorkshire terrier puppy.
