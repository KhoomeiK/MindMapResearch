At first she tried to play it off like a positive thing, like a ""You're off the hook"", because I ""love to be unique and wouldn't be comfortable if I looked like everyone else."" I told her don't be ridiculous, it's your wedding and I'll wear whatever you want. Finally she admitted it was just that her ""dream dress"" wouldn't look good in my size, and ""I'm going to have these photos for the rest of my life."" 10 years of friendship but I would still be ruining her photos."

My best friend from high school, after 10 years of friendship, declined to put me in her wedding party because I was too fat for the kind of dress she wanted. At first she tried to play it off like a positive thing, like ""good news! You're off the hook!"" And I was like wait what and she said some BS about how she knows I love to be unique and I wouldn't be happy if I looked like everyone else. I told her that's ridiculous, it's your wedding and I'll look however you want. I pushed and pushed until she finally said her ""dream dress"" wouldn't look good in my size, and ""I'm going to have these photos for the rest of my life.""

The last straw was this woman who was OBSESSED with Creative Memories, of all things. She talked to each of us like we WERE COMING to the get togethers she was always trying to throw even though most of us were not even interested in scrapbooking in the first place. ""How's picking out your photos for Friday going?"" I'M NOT COMING AND NEVER SAID I WAS. HR finally got her to stop. Now you can leave something like a Girl Scout Cookie order form in the kitchen but you're not allowed to ask directly, email, or call anyone about it. Ahh, bliss."

A local band played, and family grilled meat and veggies and made salads, with coolers of beer and soft drinks and enough champagne for all the adults to have a sip. The summer sunset provided the perfect decoration. We laughed and danced and had the best party ever all day and into the night. 16 years later, they're one of the strongest marriages I know."
