bloodborne,fq1rhtf,t1_fq1r785,1589048356.0,"You must’ve done this wrong somehow bc everytime I’ve done this, either in any of my 5 ng cycles or helping out a player, he’ll disappear after a few hits and then stumble back out of the mirror"

bloodborne,fpwppyt,t1_fpwol0y,1588967715.0,"Ok so once you get him to his second phase chase him into the mirror, don’t go all the way back down to find him again, rather go to the balcony area that looks out over the mirror he teleports out of - from there you can lock onto him from above and  use any consumables/arcane attacks until he’s dead. If that’s confusing, you can YouTube it.

Also, once you’ve killed him, be sure to backtrack and grab the moon rune and iron gate key to unlock an easy route to get the choir bell item+great one wisdom. As a warning though, I believe you have to drop the brain of mensis first otherwise you’ll be killed by frenzy very quickly upon entering this area"
bloodborne,fpwmjjz,t3_gfzpcw,1588966085.0,"Ok so one time I legit chased micolash for 20 fucking minutes because he was stuck in a loop and wouldn’t enter the room. There’s a very easy way around this. Once you enter the fight- run to the end of the hallway and hook that right up the stairs, chase micolash straight up the next set of stairs. Get him to run to the end of that hallway and run up to him so that it triggers him running down the stairs to his right. Do not follow him here, turn back around and go back down the flight of stairs you ran up to get to this elevated hallway. He’ll be standing directly in front of the room and you can just chase him straight in - works every time.

Also, do you know of the balcony cheese? Micolash is the only Bloodborne boss I’ll cheese bc he’s such a throwaway fight tbh."

bisexual,fpw7fal,t3_gfx5hc,1588958554.0,"I’m absolutely in this boat. Since childhood I’ve had an inexplicable attraction to guys, but I cruised through life solely embracing my attraction to women due to years of catholic guilt and bullying 6th grade-sophomore year of HS. Wasn’t until a few years ago that I fell in love w my best friend (a guy) once I attended university and it was a game changer. My fiancé now fully encourages me to experiment and be open to my bisexuality which is incredible, we recently arranged a foursome with one of our friends and her boyfriend and, perhaps it was a combination of E and 6 bottles of champagne between us, but for the first time in my life I wanted to go down on this guy.

Now the thought of taking it from him was a no go for me, I might be curious topping him, but it didn’t go beyond making out between us that night, but I learned a lot from that one experience alone!

So long story short I guess you don’t know until you experiment, or at least that’s how I’ve been slowly finding myself in this"
bloodborne,fpw6kpl,t3_gfx63u,1588958137.0,"This right here 👌🏻 I also love simons full set as well as the full choir set (the choir are just my favorite group in the game tho so I’m probably a bit biased)

bloodborne,fpw1zav,t3_gfwcgk,1588955860.0,"I was in this same boat until I realized how important it is to patiently boop his snoot- simply walk backwards while facing him, far enough to avoid his attacks but close enough to hit the head  with a longer weapon- all about just waiting for the right window to get in, hit him a few times n get out, then of course dodging out of the way of his charge attack

bloodborne,foyyifp,t1_foyxlbv,1588181542.0,"Nah duder- arc at 40-60 will still easily carry you in game, literally the exact same if you were to level int to 60 in DS3 and run around w crystal soul spear or CBV - you’re playing on easy mode.

bloodborne,foyx6v4,t3_gad4sq,1588180848.0,"Have you ever read anything by HP Lovecraft? The story telling here is similar - lots of implied story telling, it’s intentionally vague . Also if you think arcane is useless without the dlc then it sounds like you haven’t done a 99 arc build - executioners gloves and a call beyond basically made it so that I killed every boss, including chalice dungeons, on the first or second attempts.

Dark souls is badass as hell in its own right, the weapon/ armor / play style variety is unmatched when compared to Bloodborne - but as far as being a unique game, an entity all to itself, Bloodborne is pretty spectacular imo

The game is absolutely imperfect but god damn do I respect and love it"
