 I don't know if he's ready for a bigger club but I wouldn't mind seeing him at Juve. But def not now cause this team needs an overhaul. They were buying the wrong players in the last 2 or 3 years and every coach would have problems with this squad."

Midfield is slow and non creative, fullbacks are actually CB's playing on the flanks and their crossing is atrocious. It's all Dybala and Ronaldo by themselves. There's no 1-2s, no combinations, no through balls...

This team is put badly and it shows. It started ~2 years ago.

ps. If only we had Cancelo. I know, he's not an impressive player but he constantly attacks and has a great cross, on of the best. We should've kept him."

I think midfield and fullbacks are the biggest problem. There's no creativity, no speed, no flair, no good crossing, no overlapping... And to top it all, this team is a bad match for/with Sarri.

I'm still wondering is this happening cause Marotta got sacked. It's obvious that they don't know how to put the team together like before."
