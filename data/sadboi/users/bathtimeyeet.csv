when stealing small items like makeup or books, you can pick up two of the same items, drop one in your bag or down your sleeve, look at the label of the other one for a few seconds and put it back. 

when i’m taking RFID tags off i make sure to stick them onto another item with a tag so if an employee notices double tags they’ll think it’s a mistake. if they see that you’ve stuck a tag under a shelf or dropped it in a corner they will look back at the security tapes and identify you."
