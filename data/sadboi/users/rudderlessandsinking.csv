CPTSD,fnv5qab,t1_fnv5ari,1587281161.0,"I‚Äôve had a lifetime of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to change, you have to change‚Äù. It‚Äôs not a pathology that does terribly well in therapy if it even ever occurs to them that they need therapy in the first place. They‚Äôre very good at outmanoeuvring therapy. I understand your point about attachment. I don‚Äôt doubt that that‚Äôs why my family is so messed up but I don‚Äôt share your optimism. Yes it would be a better world if we were all taught that it‚Äôs ok to need others and be less than perfect and if we taught people healthy models for attachment but when I say narcissists I don‚Äôt just mean anything narcissistic behaviour. I mean people with NPD. It sucks for them too because they‚Äôre not having terribly satisfying relationships either. But it‚Äôs not just more education that can fix NPD if it is indeed even fixable. That‚Äôs the point I‚Äôm trying to make. Not sure why you feel the need to go after me and downvote me just because I don‚Äôt unequivocally approve of your plan."
CPTSD,fnv3tpc,t1_fnv38vn,1587279319.0,Maybe but I think you will find many of us suffer at the hands of narcissistic parents and families..
CPTSD,fnuc722,t1_fnqciqp,1587258922.0,"Shame keeps billionaires rich. Also this education doesn‚Äôt prevent narcissists from having children. They‚Äôre very good at hiding. And it‚Äôs sad and I don‚Äôt mean to demonise people with personality disorders but what I‚Äôm saying is that we need to accept that they exist and that their personality disorder is very difficult to treat and short of sterilising them no amount of education will really prevent them from causing trauma, sadly."
CPTSD,fnubw5k,t3_g3ac8o,1587258745.0,This would be ideal but then I‚Äôm guessing none of us would have been born. It sucks that we had to be raised how we were but I don‚Äôt think we should discount what we offer the world and each other.

I get that it‚Äôs difficult to parent autistic children and I‚Äôm lucky that I am high functioning but you don‚Äôt get to tell me how to feel about something I live with. Part of learning to appreciate my autism involved not holding myself to the standards of people without it. I appreciate that parents want their kids to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but autism isn‚Äôt a disease that needs to be cured. It‚Äôs just a different way to interact with the world. I hope you get the help you need helping your child but please do not treat them as if they are sick or wrong or maladjusted. The beauty of autism is that we see the world differently and you might be able to learn from our perspective. Good luck!
