Can't really dk that with basketball.

But Volleyball has this wonderful awrsome position known as a Libero.

The Libero is the defensive specialist focused entirely on receiving and stopping the ball from touching the ground, the equivelant would be a goalie in Soccer. They never have to serve, spike, block or set the ball to anyone (though many Liberos do learn how to set). I have a pretty good vertical at 34 inches, but at 5'4 I know I could never spike past a blocker, so I play Libero.

It really benefits the short players as getting to the ground super fast is a necessity, having smaller thinner hands means you can theoretically get your hand under a ball that your 6'3 Middle Blocker couldn't do.

AskReddit,fquryju,t1_fquqkor,1589663679.0,"It's just a bit of a thing most autists deal with.

Whilst we're not unempathetic one of the traits a lot of autists harbour is fact over feeling.

For example I'm pro-choice because in my eyes, until you're capable of surviving without literally feeding off of a host you're not alive.

Under that same logic if you're on life support I don't think you are alive, and so if my dad wanted to pull the plug I would be on his side. Emotional bonding to someone doesn't affect my judgement when confronted by facts, even when it can make me seem uncaring.

Autists are often different but this trait does seem to show up often when you google the most common autism traits.

In a more age appropiate manner at 10 years old we were reading a book where the main character has to part with this special alien pet they find, they'd been keeping for years, the animal that brought happiness to the main charafter through thick and thin, and the alien saw the main character as their father.

But when his species comes back to collect him, after a very hesrtbreaking scene the main character finally lets them go. And everybody was in the room was in tears, the designated reader could barely get through the paragraph.

When the teacher asked what the right choice was (keep the alien or let them go with their species) I was one of the few people who's argument focused ont he fact that the alien wouldn't be able to survive, they'd be cooped up in the main characters house until they die and that's not a good life for the alien.

Again not all autists are this way, it just seems very common that we can be seen as unempathetic people due to our struggles in voice emoting and this kind of logic in ethical debates."

We alwaya treat these like thwy're the most normal people, but we dk havw to take into consideration maybe this is one of those damn nesr militant christians who views you as part of the illuminati Vaccine conspiracy for not believing in God."
SquaredCircle,fqsau62,t1_fqsacpe,1589602486.0,"I'm not calling Jeff a nobody, I'm saying that if it was a nobody...hell it actually would have been better.

If Undertaker had invited the an audience member to fight him and he stomped some random 20 year old who was just supposed to be a fan, and by the end of it the fan stood up and told him he was still standing. That would be amazing. Instead we had daredevil Jeff Hardy, in a ladder match. Use a ladder like twice. And then get stomped. 

Because he actually had name recognition. I feel that Jeff Hardy getting stomped ruined the whole fight to me. It didn't feel like Jeff earned the respect of the Undertaker, especially Heel Undertaker who should have finished the job then and there. He didn't fight tooth and nail only to lose bittersweetly. I knew by the 7th minute in that Jeff wasn't gonna win this and it was just going to be teaching Jeff a lesson. I thought this was some kind of punishment match or some shit tbh.

If Jeff was a nobody the overall fight aould be a lot better because realistically they would have nothing to prove. Jeff did have something to prove, that'd why he spoke up. But he never actually proved anything.

And yes. I am genuinely confounded, puzzled, perplexed. I legitimately can not see how someone could enjoy this, unless you just fucking hate Jeff Hardy."
SquaredCircle,fqsa7qd,t1_fqs9hh3,1589602055.0,I guess I just don't see how someone with a 15 minute mudpie stomped into their chest telling their opponent they're still standing with rope assistance is...anything other than stupid. Definitely doesn't seem career defining in my eyes.
SquaredCircle,fqsa1vv,t1_fqs9fkw,1589601942.0,"What story did it tell? Is there something I'm missing from the original match? I'm all for underdogs and they don't even have to win. But getting mudstomped for 15 minutes then going ""hey, I'm not dead yet"" just doesn't scream underdog. It screams masochist.

But I guess I'm just never going to understand the apparant brilliance at work here."
SquaredCircle,fqs9wlf,t1_fqs9fzv,1589601843.0,"I guess I can't srop you from thinking that but I do genuinely want to wrap my head around this. It just...it just genuinely doesn't make sense how this is anything. Maybe I'm spoiled by the 90's but since when was trash talk a career making move in the WWE? ""Oh wow this nobody got fucking mudstomped for 15 minutes but he told Undertaker to go fuck himself best match evar!"""
