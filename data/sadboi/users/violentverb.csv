movingtojapan,fn5zjpp,t3_fzq9s8,1586681601.0,"Moving the dogs over is going to cost you about $1500 per dog without vet fees, rabies vaccines/tests and other bits.

Also be aware that most landlords will want an extra pet ""deposit"" that is basically a large gift of money before you move in. Separate to your deposit and key money. Finding rental places isn't too bad but it might be more difficult with 3 dogs. Also be prepared to pay more than what others are for rent.

I moved over a few years ago with my cat and the biggest expenses I had were all linked to my cat."

tarot,fkjzql9,t1_fkjzayg,1584267242.0,Same! Is it just the numbered cards in the deck?
tarot,fkg1100,t1_fkfykxa,1584147300.0,I do but I still consider myself to be a beginner!
tarot,fke9bbd,t1_fke8lk5,1584108272.0,This is my first deck as I was drawn to the artwork and I agree with you they are a no nonsense deck. Tells me exactly what I need whether I like it or not. Thanks for your words.
tarot,fke4802,t1_fke43tx,1584104742.0,The Wild Unknown Tarot! I chose it because of how beautiful I think it is.
movingtojapan,fkd7l67,t3_fhqzwh,1584070427.0,"I didn't realise you were limited to 2 cities that are very close to each other. 

It all depends what kind of life you enjoy.

Kobe is quieter than Osaka but has more nature with the mountains and sea closer."
movingtojapan,fkd1b88,t3_fhqzwh,1584065968.0,Why don't you live in between in somewhere like Nishinomiya and then you can easily visit both?
depression,fkapt84,t3_fh565g,1584016341.0,"I started doing this. My counselor said it was a really good step to admitting that I'm not okay, most people follow up with asking what's up and I just tell them I don't want to talk about it but want to be honest about stuff.

I hope things get better for you."
movingtojapan,fjzlo1i,t3_ffmgne,1583722698.0,Kobe is a lovely place to live. A city close to the mountains and sea.
TeachingUK,fjgeavo,t3_fdc1mt,1583323843.0,Depends on the lesson but I try to make sure as many of my classes are inquiry based. So I usually give the students an open ended question or problem for them to solve which will lead them to the content.
TeachingUK,fhhaz0c,t1_fhhas62,1581599595.0,"Yeah, whichever you do you can teach primary! 3-7 just helps you more with early years."
TeachingUK,fhhal7x,t3_f39m9a,1581599288.0,I did 5-11 and loved it. 3-7 is better if you want to focus in EYFS but if not I would so 5-11. It doesn't overly matter when you get a job anyway.
FitnessMotivation,fhdvmz5,t3_f2jg40,1581503960.0,"If you can, try going to a class at the gym. I always find that much easier to cope with as everyone is doing the same and focusing on themselves instead of waiting for machines etc. But the fact that you want too is a really good sign!"
pokemon,fh9n4c1,t1_fh9gmxx,1581385131.0,Thanks! Going to be painting done more soon so will post those too.
teachinginjapan,fgs5l2w,t1_fgiqon5,1581072713.0,Experience in any international school is fine.
teachinginjapan,fgikxbt,t3_eyd0v2,1580824611.0,I'm a teacher in an international school in Japan and it's a really competitive market. Home country teaching certificate is a must and most schools won't even look at your CV if you don't have at least 3-5 years teaching experience in either another international school or home country school.
TeachingUK,fgadigu,t3_exnfka,1580649986.0,"I took over a year out after finishing my PGCE. I went travelling and lived in Sydney for 9 months. Came back in December and signed up for a supply agency and within 3 weeks got a full time job.
It's not a stupid thing to do and I'm glad I did it before settling into teaching as it's not the easiest career to take breaks from.

Good luck!"
Teachers,fdgpbzq,t3_eajiq4,1578404731.0,"This previous Sunday, I spent an hour doing various different skin care tasks in preparation for the first week back. 
Felt good."
mentalhealth,fdgp7j4,t3_el8jir,1578404630.0,"As a teacher, I really try to do as much as I can to promote and look after my students wellbeing, especially their mental health. 
IMO more support needs to be put in place in schools to help students and support families. 
Hopefully the next generation of people will grow up with more support and awareness of mental health."
Osaka,fc7tztj,t3_egkblg,1577518589.0,I'm not big on clubs but Space Station is a really cool little bar!
millionairemakers,fbig2qb,t3_edhj2m,1576899967.0,Merry Christmas!
movingtojapan,ezr5r8i,t3_d1y70w,1568069171.0,I brought my cat 2 years ago to Japan and it is a lengthy and expensive process. If you are serious about moving to Japan for more than 3 months then I would definitely recommend you do it. But to me 3 months is a short amount of time for all the stress it is to get pets here.
