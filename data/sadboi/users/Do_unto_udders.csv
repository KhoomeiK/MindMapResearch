Anxiety,fpsb9p1,t1_fpsb523,1588870565.0,You're welcome!  I hope that even if sleep apnea is ruled out that you still get some peace of mind from knowing you breathe properly in your sleep.  :)
Anxiety,fpsaqul,t3_gf6gv9,1588870314.0,"I'm going to second a sleep study.  This happened to me nightly about 20 times a night.  I had a sleep study done and I had around 120 apnea events *per hour.*  With the Bilevel PAP things really improved.  I'd have a a couple in my sleep per week.  I started seeing a decent psychiatrist who listened to me and getting weekly therapy.  My therapist and psychiatrist work for the same organization.  They communicated and got my meds sorted out.  Now  I have a couple of panic attacks in my sleep every few month.  I've probably had as many in my sleep in the last year as I used to have in a night or two previously.  I think a big part of that was therapy and learning how to not be afraid of sleep.  I didn't realize how anxious I was about sleep without knowing it.  My panic attacks cause severe amnesia, vomiting, and I'd wake up peeing in the bed, throwing up, and not knowing where I was even though it almost always happened in the same place--my home.

I was also having at least 50 panic attacks per day while waking before working with my new treatment team as well.  Again, forgetting where I was, what I was doing, the date, time, day, my own name, address, phone number, and then complete amnesia spanning for weeks at a time.  There are entire years of my life that I don't remember at all.  Now I have between 1-10 panic attacks every month and those are around my menstrual cycle every time."

I worked there for two weeks before quarantine began.

NoStupidQuestions,fp2edgt,t3_gauk3v,1588260302.0,"I think a lot of people are missing the true roots of American ""freedom"" and how this plays out in modern America.  I'll do a little ELI5 (or more like ELI10) type response.

Things have shifted and ""freedom"" in colloquial American terms is based on the idea of *freedom* that led to the founding of America.  Our obsession with the word ""freedom"" comes from the very beginnings of America.  The desire for freedom is what led to America being formed in the first place.  At the time America was formed the freedoms given to the public in general, especially in terms of government and politics, was much more true to the term compared to anywhere else in the world at that time or prior to it.  As such, the word means much to us as a sort of heritage throwback.  For example, most license plates from my state read ""First in Freedom.""  I'm in the southern US.  This is certainly, um...  Not the case.  :)

The average American has had ""freedom"" drilled into his/her head since history was first taught to him/her.  We were founded with very liberating principals, especially in lieu of the rest of the world at that time (particularly Europe, especially Britain and colonies being founded globally by Europeans).  A lot of people are unfortunately not too educated about *global* current events and how America stacks up in comparison.  In our history classes the global political comparisons, for all intents and purposes, pretty much stop around the end of WWII and almost hardline after the Korean War.  The only recent international references are military operations attempting to liberate others (like the War in Iraq).  We focus on America's international involvements that attempt to grant more freedom to other countries and not how our current ideas and applications of freedom fit into a modern framework and global setting. This leads to a lot of people still assuming ""we're # 1!"" as most people are unwilling or too disinterested to do that amount of research on their own."

Anxiety,fnt9z38,t1_fnt1bff,1587237486.0,"It took me ten years to finally start talking but by that point I didn't have much to lose.  I will be honest, a lot of my talking resulted from my DWI.  The court told me I could either go to jail or go into a program where I go to therapy as often as their evaluator recommended and have the charge expunged.  I now call getting that DWI ""The best worst thing that ever happened to me.""  I just knew when I rounded the corner and saw the checkpoint that my life was over.  In retrospect I think that's when things actually started to get rolling for me.  I definitely still struggle, but that was my wake-up moment.  I love my therapist and being anxious it is incredible that something I thought would damn me for life has ended up being probably the best thing to ever happen to me.  Again...  Perspective is so important, as well as being able to look at how things progress over the long-term.  I had to learn that though.  And I'm still learning it.  I've still got quite a ways to go but the psychiatrists who told my parents six years ago that I was a ""hopeless case"" and to ""abandon ship"" have been proven so wrong that my therapist actually asked where they worked a few months ago and called them up to probably say some...  Interesting things.  Haha!

Make a plan about what you want to talk about.  It doesn't need to be detailed, just write a few bullet points down so you know kind of where to start when you call.  I was fortunate to find help through a service offered by a major local university with a huge medical school.  They're a state school so they are able to offer additional services like pharmacy discounts at their pharmacies and waive a lot of therapy fees if people apply and are approved.

Your teletherapist will absolutely not abandon one client she's currently talking to in order to talk to you.  I've actually asked around a lot about that because I was previously in a similar situation.  They chose to work in a field where they knew they would need to be available and flexible in order to help people--which is something she obviously wanted to do or else she wouldn't still be in that role.  She will likely finish things up and contact you after that to schedule a time to talk with you and check-in briefly.

Regarding religion...  I was raised in a chuch that I loved.  I always volunteered with them, did outreach missions, and things like that until I moved away for college.  When the anxiety, depression and drug/alcohol abuse really kicked up I was 100% convinced that there was no God and that I'd been a fool for ever believing such a thing.  For years I believe that.  In fact, if you told me a year ago that I'd be returning to my religion at this point I'd say *you* were the one with the severe mental health issues and multiple failed suicide attempts.  Returning to my religion is something that actually happened after breaking up with my ex fiance (the second best worst thing to ever happen to me).  The story is actually quite surreal...  My mom cried when I told her and my dad had chillbumps that were more like mountains.  I'd be happy to share that with you but my intent is not to preach to anyone unless it's requested.

Again, I'm here if you need to send me a PM, even if it's just to have someone to chat with about something mundane.  I'm sure it would help me out too!  :)  I have NO friends right now due to isolation from my ex.  I have my dog, sister, and parents and that's literally it.  If you'd like you can tell me what region you live in if you feel comfortable and I can help you find some resources that will suit your situation."
Anxiety,fnsv9aq,t1_fnshey1,1587229453.0,"You're very welcome.  I'm glad it helped!  And don't feel like you cajoled me to do something I didn't want to.  I actually made this account recently just to try to help people while I continue to help myself so I was simply doing something I both wanted and needed to do.

As far as you not having a ""right to anxiety...""  I've some feelings about that too.  If you have anxiety that's the only justification you need.  There are things occurring biochemically and psychologically that you might never be able to pick up on that fuel your anxiety.  I think in many ways that having anxiety that can't be definitely linked to an/a few event(s) is just as difficult in different ways, such as not being able to nail down the source of it.  That makes it harder in different ways to cope with because it's always there but for subtle reasons.

I definitely feel you on feeling a burden, waste of space/time/resources/oxygen.  Just because you're not perfect doesn't mean any of that is true though.  If it was then it would be true for every human who has ever lived because pobody's nerfect.  I assume that you're on this sub seeking support.  If you were toxic or a burden you most certainly wouldn't be putting any effort into it.  I'd know because that was me 100% a few years ago.  Then I knew I was a burden because my family, ex, etc. voiced that to me to some degree--not so much that I was a burden but that it made things difficult for everyone.  Especially in hindsight when I recently asked if they found me to be a burden that is what they said.  They said it was difficult for them, stressful, they worried a lot, but that seeing how well I'm doing now, that I'm contining to improve, and that I've used the quarantine situation to start helping folks again both online and in person that it was more than worth it.  I went from feeling fake and like a waste of space that was sucking energy from those around me to lifting up those same folks--and even strangers (although I will admit that I'm still scared as crap of people I don't know).

Anyone who thinks you're a burden isn't worth your time.  You're going through something extremely difficult, mostly invisible, and the general population lacks the empathy required to connect with you.  Those people who could make you feel like that, especially if it's intentional, are the toxic burdens.  Not you.  :)  <3"
Anxiety,fns9s9c,t1_fns88s6,1587216668.0,"I totally get that.  Hopefully this helps...  Fear in an evolutionary sense is quite beneficial because it keeps us alive.  That's quite an outdated mechanism in modern times for the most part.  However, times and living conditions are changing much more rapidly than our minds and bodies can.  Heck, even therapists and psychiatrists are trying to keep up with it.

I was raised in a middle class home, taught to be nice to others.  I grew up volunteering at food banks, going to church, volunteering for schools, in girl scouts, etc.  I started getting bullied in second grade and it didn't stop until about 11th grade.  It started, I can see now, because I was a happy kid with good clothes, nice toys, etc., going to school with a lot of low-income kids.  They were jealous and the fact that I didn't do anything to piss them off due to being naturally nice and polite just frustrated them further.  To them I had it made.  I had everything I could need and much of what I could want.  I always had social anxiety due to what these kids would say and do to me but I held myself together for a while.

When I was 14 years old I was raped.  I developed anorexia.  I dropped about 100lbs in six months.  That's when peers started giving me an easier time.  They knew something was going on but not what it could be.  I never dealt with the trauma and began drinking my sophomore year in college.  I graduated top of my class, had a full scholarship to my #1 college of choice (in fact I only applied at that school because I knew I would get in), and finished my ranked 3rd in the freshman class my first year.  That was out of a little under 20,000 students so...  Yeah.  Quite good there.

But then the anxiety ramped up seemingly out of nowhere.  I now know that it was from meeting my ex fiance and the constant stream of alcohol and drugs that he fed me up until about a year ago when I got a DWI.  At that point I was having about 50 panic attacks every day.  I was physicially addicted to alcohol after being the kid in school who encouraged others to not try drugs and alcohol.  My BAC at the time of the DWI was .25.  That's scary stuff.  I thought I knew at that point that every bad thing I'd felt about myself was true.  I'd failed at school, I'd stopped going to church, connecting with people, I was ashamed of myself, I'd been such a good girl growing up and still I was raped.  How does that happen to a good person?  *Why would it?*  I went from raising $100,000 for insecticide-treated bed nets for villages in Chad, Africa in a town of 10,000 people to someone who was completely alone, scared of everything, and either always drunk, hungover, or--most likely--both.

I'm getting back on my feet now.  Due to the bullying when I was younger, my ex fiance (we broke up about 9 weeks ago, btw), and things that happened in between I'm still paranoid about people thinking I think I'm the best thing ever.  I told my therapist this and my parents this separately.  They all said the same things:

1. You can't control what other people think.  Their perceptions and conclusions are based on their experiences and even how that particular day is going, just like it is for you.
2. You can pay attention to what *you* think.  When you start thinking something silly, try to laugh at yourself like I do.  It really does help.
3. It won't be easy, especially since this has been my thought process for over a decade and I'm only 27 years old.
4. Don't ignore those feelings.  THAT is where the danger lies...  Trying to push it away.  The best thing I've done is acknowledge that's how I feel and accept it.  From there I've been able to start working on why I feel that way, remaining mindful of that feeling, and paying attention to people from afar to see how I perceive their behavior when it doesn't include me (especially strangers).

Some anxiety has a purpose--it helps us stay safe and better our lives.  When it becomes out of control is when we really have a problem.  That doesn't mean it's hopeless though.  That feeling of hopelessness is just another of anxiety's screwed up brain games.  We're harder on ourselves than anyone else ever could be and it's very hard to start recovering and improving when you're so hard on yourself.  Forgive yourself and appreciate yourself.  Others already do!  The anxiety just wants to blind you to that.

I'm sorry for the length of this but I hope that it helps you and possibly some other folks too.  :)"

Anxiety,fnd7qcw,t3_g0wazg,1586861955.0,"Happy birthday!  Here's a little present for you.  

I ended last year and began this year in a psych ward.  For the last six years or so I've been in psych wards 2-3 times per year, sometimes for over three months during a single stay.  Last year the stay were both more frequent and longer.  I knew, kind of instinctively, that things were about to change big time for me.  I didn't know if they would be good or bad changes.  Having severe anxiety (50 panic attacks per day at one point) I naturally assumed they would be bad.  I'd been in therapy consistently for about ten months at that point after getting a DWI in February and trying to wreck my car to kill myself.  The court recognized my problem and said if I consistently attended therapy several times per week that they would drop all charges.  I now call that the ""best worst thing"" that ever happened to me.

But that eerie feeling that things were changing or were about to...  Yeah.  I was with my fiance for nine years!  I lived with him and had never lived on my own.  He was treating me like crap and we broke up.  He had apparently been stealing money from my parents and keeping me around to have the rent paid, home cooked meals, pet care, etc.  I thought that all of that progress would be lost because for the first time ever...  LITERALLY...  I would be living alone.

Now I have an awesome apartment and a job I love, granted we're not working now.  But they refused to lay off anyone.  I only worked there for three weeks before the shut down.  Being isolated socially has been difficult.  I tend to have few people to interact with anyway due to my anxiety, fear of rejection, and just having moved to a new area after the breakup.  I didn't realize that I'm actually a likable person with a killer sense of humor still until being single (""liberated"") and feeling comfortable being myself again.

The isolation resulting from the pandemic has definitely taken its toll on me.  I went from 50+ panic attacks per day (\*sigh\* before anyone asks...  YES they were pretty much constant with 5 minutes for recovery, had them in my sleep, etc.) to none for several consecutive months over the last 13-14 months.  When I did have them it was no more than three during an entire month!  I had 25 on Thursday, 17 on Friday, six on Saturday, three on Sunday, and two yesterday.  But it's getting better.  And I felt amazing even through that.  I know how hard I've been working and even though this situation is shitty for everyone my hard work is paying off.  I'm still helping others and doing it much moreso now that I have free time and no man child.  I'm seeing how much strangers appreciate my acts of kindness.  I'm still feeling like me.  Most importantly, though, I feel like this is an excellent trial run of the skills I've aggregated over the last year+.  It has been.  My parents and sister, pretty much the only friends and family I have left after the isolation my ex forced upon me are absolutely amazed at how I've held up.  I've been hospitalized for SH, suicidal ideation/plans, and have acted out over much less.  This is more intense of a situation than any of the things that prompted that response out of me in the past.  And through all of this I've returned to my former/true self.  Funny, quick-witted, friendly, and ready to help out my neighbors.  No need to know who the neighbors are, either.  The ""neighbor"" part is all I need to know!  :)

Sorry for the rambling, but I felt the context would benefit you.  My point is this...  You can get through this and when you DO! you are going to be so damned proud of yourself.  Hold that torch high in the air and keep using that new flame to light the path for your future, because you've made it through one of the most difficult things most people currently living ever have and you did it with a plate full of...

I don't wish him any ill will but I know that after my parents told me how much money he'd siphoned from them and how I did ALL household things for him that he's got a mental readjustment period going on that is more difficult than where I am in my alcohol recovery at this point.  He will get taken from him what he's taken from others.  That's just how things seem to go (hence my username--minus the pun part).

Also I think that both in the short term and long term I will be much better off for it.  I've already helped a lot of men and women in similar circumstances through chatting online and plan to go to facilities helping them once things open back up again."
NoStupidQuestions,fn6xjl2,t1_fn6wqah,1586709294.0,Thank you very much!  I've actually been sober for about six days now.  The hardest days for me are usually 3-7 so I'm getting close!

Many apologizes but thank you for a much-needed laugh!  Lmao"

NoStupidQuestions,fn6uthu,t1_fn55d19,1586707782.0,"Wow...  Such a simple way to describe it but it really hits the nail on the head.  It's ""distracting.""  Succinct and completely fits how I came to use it prior to recovery and how it's been used the few times I relapse.  Anxiety and depression crept in after the first and longest periods of improvement I've ever had and I wanted something to distract me from it.  After being alone in my apartment for weeks as the pandemic developed I was starting to need something to distract me from the sudden surge in anxiety and depression.  I can deal with one or another okay when they creep in, but this was much more intense and both at the same time along with a lot of my typical coping skills being restricted.  Thinking about it as a way I attempt to distract myself--and terming it like that--will really help me keep in mind what's really going on.  Thank you!"
NoStupidQuestions,fn6u4x3,t1_fn5kc9x,1586707396.0,"Fortunately I am getting help.  I was going to 1-on-1 therapy weekly and a group meeting at the same place weekly as well.  That's helped a lot.  I've been doing that for about a year.  I think having that carpet suddenly ripped from beneath me so unexpectedly has thrown me off.  I'm still doing 1-on-1 online weekly but the group chats haven't been possible due to the types of patients where I've been going.  I'm not well off financially but compared to them I'm still much better off because I can do telehealth.  Many of them don't have phones, let alone computers with steady internet connections."

NoStupidQuestions,fn6hhkg,t1_fn51pjp,1586699415.0,"Thank you so much for the thorough explanation and sharing that story.  I think the fact that I move and am no longer near my old alcohol-purchase locations (and am also farther away from any) has helped out a lot.  I actually gave in the other day when I'd been driving by where I lived before my recent move.  First I drove past the old apartment and thought about what had happened there then passed the liquor store farther down the road.  It's so difficult to crave it after that even though it brought up so many bad memories--both the location and the thought of drinking.  But being able to remember what you've just said will help greatly.  So much of this is mind over matter.

I've got a pretty solid arsenal of coping skills now.  My parents have been locked down since the same time I was and haven't been anywhere except to see me.  I'd get their groceries and they'd pick them up.  I decided to take my pup and come stay the weekend with them since we're the only people who've been around one another.  It's been a great reset for my mind.  Between mixing up the scenery again, hearing that others are struggling with this just as much as I am although their mental health is much better...  Not feeling alone...  And hearing that every time they see me that I look happier, HEALTHIER...  It's really helped me not only regain my recovery perspective but take in that view even more.  The thoughtful replies like yours have helped tremendously too.  Thank you SO very much!  I can use what I've got now to continue working my way up slowly and look forward to even better days ahead."
NoStupidQuestions,fn53cfo,t1_fn522l2,1586654941.0,"Thank you for sharing this.  I had many more bad times with it than good.  I didn't even start drinking enough to become intoxicated until I was around 24-25 years old and it got bad about two years ago.  I'm 27 now.  Thank you for reminding me of the importance of not only acceptance but perspective.  Keeping that perspective will really help me out.  My family is astounded with how well I've handled this.  It's been bumpy still but I've actually held this together.  I've had far, far less send me into disastrous downward spirals.  My parents and sisters said I should really be proud of myself and keep this in mind in the future when things get rough.  Hearing how someone who's been there worded it really helped both of your messages hit me that much harder.  Thank you.  Thank you!  <3"

NoStupidQuestions,fn4sxdv,t1_fn4rozk,1586648269.0,Thank you very much.  Unfortunately my ex kept me separated from most people except my parents and little sister for about 2/3 of the eight and a half years we were together.  We just broke up near the end of February and I'm living on my own (for the first time ever) in a new area and really don't know anyone other than my therapist and a few regular people from our meetings at AA.  The regulars are older folks and not really into communicating in modern ways...  Although it truly is a necessity now.  :/
NoStupidQuestions,fn4q8fg,t1_fn4q3zx,1586646632.0,Thank you!  Being able to look back on this will help too.  :)
NoStupidQuestions,fn4o9fu,t1_fn4lcrn,1586645454.0,"Yeah, I'm working on that now.  I think the social distancing is what messed me up.  I was going to meetings multiple times per week along with weekly one-on-one and group therapies.  When that was suddenly cut off it kind of threw me for a loop."
NoStupidQuestions,fn4ny4b,t1_fn4lfyc,1586645270.0,Thank you!  That's why I posted this.  I'm not just going to try to win the battle...  I'm going to!  I suppose that's why CBT and mindfulness techniques have been so helpful getting me this far.  I just need to keep employing that mind over matter!
Anxiety,fn2recb,t1_fn2qthz,1586600253.0,"Thank you very much!  I'm fortunate that my job loss is only temporary and that it's still waiting.  That in itself puts me ahead of a lot of people who are affected like this.  I finally got some restful sleep last night and woke up so ready to hit the ground running (even if it's running in place) that I went ahead and took a shower.  I've got MDD too and hadn't showered in at least four days as of today.  It's amazing how just doing that one thing for myself feels like I've set myself up for a pretty great day.

I've gotten a lot of therapy and started taking the Well-Being class on Coursera taught by Yale staff before it apparently was recommended on national news sources.  That combo has really helped me hold it together.  And also that combined with what you said...  ""The sun always comes after the storm.""  I thought that was a load of crap for most of my life.  But after putting work into bettering myself and enduring the worst year of my life and STILL coming out better than what I was before despite circumstances that would make that mostly impossible for most people...  Yeah, I'm a firm believer now.

I woke up today and did some mindfulness exercises for about fifteen minutes and felt better.  Showered, took my meds, and felt better.  Reading your reply has me convinced that I am indeed going to make today much better.  Thank you SO much!  <3"
news,fn1gcex,t3_fygekv,1586561432.0,"After over a dozen psychiatric hospitalizations, breaking up with my abusive ex, moving into my own place for the first time and getting my dream job...  I'm stuck alone.  I'm a recovering alcoholic who was months sober.  Not anymore.  I worked so fucking hard and lost it all in a few weeks.  I haven't hurt myself since my last hospitalization in December but I've come close to it.  I would be successful this time because no one would even know soon enough, let alone be able to get to me and get me treatment.

I've cracked under less.  Much less...  But something is keeping me going now.  I poured out the rest of my alcohol stash this morning.  We can do this."
NorthCarolina,fn0szz3,t1_fmzjkxf,1586548164.0,"I filed 3/20 like OP and I'm still pending as well.  I'm starting to get quite anxious.  I take five prescription medications daily after over the last year have finally been able to live like a normal 27 year old woman again.  But having been out of work for so long I can't afford to get my meds right now and I'm due for refills in a little less than a week.  I went from having around 50 panic attacks a day to half a dozen PER MONTH.  Over the last 48 hours I've had about 25 panic attacks and it's really starting to affect my memory, which is  making it that much scarier.  I've only been able to keep track by keeping a journal and tallies.  :/"

I went to get groceries for my parents earlier this week and there was a man behind me in line so close that he was touching me.  Employees had already taped six feet lines down every checkout lane.  Pretty much everyone else in the store was keeping a decent distance, at least five feet.  He was almost definitely on drugs or something, but still...  I was doing everything properly and still got as close to a stranger as I ever have through no fault of my own.

Not trying to argue.  :)  Just want to point out that some people aren't too bright."
