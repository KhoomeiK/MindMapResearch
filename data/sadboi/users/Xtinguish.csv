Video games are generally about the journey through the story. It's much harder to pull meaning from this.

I think the most you can do with games is look at their cultural value and how their content changed and reflects on the moral shifts of society.

It would also be possible to discuss games as more of a digital art study. There are so many artistic choices in both the visuals and the music.
