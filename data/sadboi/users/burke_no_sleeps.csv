It ensures I try to get things done, and for every thing I get done, I feel better about myself.. and gradually those little hits of dopamine make me less depressed. Plus I have less time to brood. 

Keeping busy is important! Exercise is great too - distracts your mind, releases good chemicals, makes you generally feel better about yourself and about life. 

I'm working on not beating myself up for failures, and recognizing when I just can't do a task today. I still have days where nothing happens, especially right now. It's all a work in progress. 

Can you do telehealth calls with the school counselor for now? Are you covered under your mom's insurance, are you eligible for government funded insurance? Is there any way to get you the support you need? Investigate it, ask questions, get some help from your school or your doctor. 

As for friends.. well, work on mental health first and foremost. Then work on being / becoming an interesting person capable of enjoying themselves, which makes you interesting and enjoyable to others.  It might take years. Join some groups online, practice socializing and making friends, but I think the best method is in person. 

Work on improving your existing friendships. Why do you feel people don't like you? Is it low confidence / low self-esteem or is it specific behaviors you can work on changing? 

What goals are you working towards right now? What are you contributing to? What makes you feel valued or valuable, and how can you add more of it into your life? It's a challenge to remain positive about a life without purpose or meaning. 

I use Habitica to stay on track but you could try a bullet journal or just a checklist if that works better for you.

I think people get the two confused just because of the ""psycho-"" prefix and vague negative connotations. 

Bad horror over-explains itself, which sometimes results in a person's behavior getting labeled with a diagnosis when really it's much more frightening if they're an otherwise totally ""normal"" person. I love Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" but I hate the ""psychiatrist explains why he did it"" ending. 

There's also the modern trend of claiming mental illness to try to escape legal consequences. It's rarely successful and life in a psych ward can't be fun, but in popular culture it's considered an easy way out of responsibility. I'm concerned it reinforces this popular idea of mentally ill people being dangerous, violent criminals. It might be a case of life imitating art, rather than the other way around."

Also, I don't think modern psychiatry or journalism use the term ""psychopath"" anymore, because it's a negative label that suggests consistently dangerous or erratic behavior detached from consensual reality. They may describe someone as being ""psychotic"" or ""having a psychotic episode"", which changes the focus from the person to the behavior itself, and clarifies that the person is affected by an episodic fit.

We are not our actions, and some of us are shocked, dismayed, hurt, or embarrassed by the tricks our own brains play. We can try to help others understand, we can try to fix mistakes we've made, we can take responsibility and make amends, but it's still a challenge none of us chose and one we'd rather not have.

My weight fluctuated a lot when I was in school. I was lucky enough to have a gym to go to, but I rarely did because it made me really self-conscious and then I'd have worse symptoms and energy issues.

Bodyweight fitness might be a great idea for you. I've been doing a very simple regimen for the past month and it's improved my energy and made me feel better about my body.

There's a great subreddit, r/bodyweight I think, and they have videos for all their suggested workouts so you can see if you're doing it correctly.

What I'm doing: (20 - 40 a day, broken up)
- dunbbell curls w full 1gal water jugs (abt 8lbs)
- wall push-ups
- crunches (I can only do 40 before it really gets to me but my belly is one area I'm trying to work on, so I'm trying to push that number up)
- punches / kicks
- stretching
- stair sets (I do 3 at a time, walk in circles to rest, then do 3 more)

There are quite a few assistance subreddits (r/assistance should be a hub) where asking for money or labor is fine. However, as far as I know, most reputable schools don't demand a years tuition all at once up front. Have you spoken to the financial department at this school for advice and guidance?

It's unethical at best and illegal at worst to ask someone else to write essays to award you scholarships. Some people here may have good advice on studying / researching / writing them, though.

There's also r/proofread, which receives many submissions from people looking for editorial feedback on school essays and reports. You might be able to get ideas on topics and organization. It is illegal and unethical to steal someone else's work, however.

It sounds to me like you should consider a different school, if this one is entirely beyond your ability to afford. Student debt is a massive problem in this country and, depending on your chosen field, an employer may not even care if you have a degree. You might want to reconsider community college or an online school just to earn credits and keep moving forward until you're in a better position to pursue school out of state.

Good luck! I'm positive there's a solution to your issue. Just remain calm and positive, and you WILL find a way to solve your problems."

When you use BPD do you mean bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder?

Generally statements such as ""if you have to ask [x] you already know the answer"" are self-evident situations. People know if they're consciously lying; they don't wonder about it.

It's very common to feel like a liar or a fake when you're experiencing very odd and identity-disturbing symptoms like this, though. It's also common for people with borderline personality disorder, schizoid disorders, and psychotic disorders to suspect or feel that they are somehow faking their own symptoms.

A lot of older fighting games - ""traditional"" ones - were released as arcade games. If you wanted to make money, they had to be accessible to anyone, so there had to be basic predictable controls.

Street Fighter was, I think, one of the first to introduce combo input chains, and then it was a matter of knowing who knew those codes and whether you could button mash faster than them.

Original Mortal Kombat didn't have four-button combos until 3 or 4, I think.
