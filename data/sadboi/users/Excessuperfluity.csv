BipolarReddit,fp4tpxt,t3_gbap0e,1588307145.0,"Bipolar with psychotic features here too. One of the challenging things for me is that I struggle to commit to things as I so often need time away and don't want to disappoint people, so I know that can be hard. I also get embarrassed when I look back on how strangely I may have behaved sometimes...

I would recommend trying two things at once so you aren't totally reliant on a single activity. How about a discord on something you like so you're communicating with less pressure. Add volunteering/support group/writer's group (replace writer with whatever you care about). Even a couple of hours a week can help you practice make connections and as corny as it sounds, it helps to do something where a common interest is at its core.

Work is often a great place to meet up with people. Do you have something planned for when college ends?

Writing this post was a start in my opinion. Good luck."

OpenDogTraining,fomfmw2,t3_g7xf46,1587888273.0,"1. Stop taking your dog on walks for now and exercise them in your own yard or somewhere enclosed. Practice techniques that teach your dog to walk closely beside you inside, then for short distances outside and then gradually increase to the immediate street - half a block, a block etc. You don’t have control of your dog yet so do not risk yourself, your dog, other pets and other people. 

2. Again, don’t risk your dog until you have control. Find a balanced trainer online and work through short training sessions every day until you are in charge and your dog looks to you for guidance when on leash. Reinforce and build on training every day. Dogs want to please us and have a job so give your dog a job. If they fail, step back and try again. 

3. If chasing cats is from prey drive, you are unlikely to ever fully overcome that. I had a ridgeback boxer mix and that never resolved (unsurprisingly). I was never ok with putting other people’s pets at risk so I never allowed her around cats. 

4. As others have suggested, try an ecollar but make sure you know how to use it. For such a high drive dog, this sounds the best option. 

Start small each day, reinforce and build. Discipline and obedience regarding sit, down, leave it, place and recall are vital. Break these down into small pieces and you will see improvement."

UnresolvedMysteries,fohno91,t1_foh9qo3,1587769089.0,"The reasons there is some suspicion he felt remorse or shock or whatever is because:

1) He was very, very careful about not being seen in each of the prior kidnappings/rapes
2) Karmein’s mum said she was a smart, feisty kid who was likely to fight back and not just follow orders
3) The previous victims said he was “nice” to them and even “gentle” (aside from the horror he was putting them through). He therefore seems to be one of those rapists with the revolting fantasy that the victims “enjoy” it and are like their “girlfriend” for the time of the ordeal. Twisted, but those rapists are out there.

Considering those points, it’s possible things went too far and his bubble was burst when he felt he had to kill to protect his identity and chose that over allowing Karmein to live. 

But you’re definitely right too. He may simply have died or gone to prison for something else. Very possible."

I think you are conflating the actions of a minority. Consider this, for example; in the US there has been action in a number of jurisdictions to clear the backlog of rape kits. They have been finding  that recovered DNA is shared across multiple kits and cases and therefore that many rapes are committed by the same men. The same is true of other sex offences, where the same man may commit crimes against scores of children, for example.

It can help to stop focusing on the worst stories which can become self reinforcing. Most men are good. Most women are too. Those that aren't shouldn't be fucking it up for the rest of us though. Stop giving them so much power."

My psychiatrist has not diagnosed anyone. In 4 years of therapy with her, the topic has come up as I try to understand why my mother beat the shit out of me physically and emotionally. She has been clear she cannot diagnose but said a personality disorder is possible and I have asked about BPD. My mother has seen a psychiatrist after being forced to, and both bipolar and BPD were mentioned. She said it was all bullshit,  stopped going and didn’t take the prescribed meds or attend counselling.

If my mother doesn’t have BPD + BAD or some other combination then I guess that makes her evil. Instead, I choose to accept that she is suffering and the pain she has caused me is like the pain she causes herself. I already said I have never posted on that sub so I haven’t vented but I have read some of the posts when she’s been especially out of control. 

It may be worth mentioning my own psychology degree.

It’s easier said than done to stay away from the booze and whatever else gives you relief. Don’t beat yourself up too much about that just do the best you can. Good luck!"
BipolarReddit,ex1fffw,t1_ex17r2g,1565942820.0,"I have these and also experience psychosis. If what you’ve described  only happen when you’re falling asleep, they very well could be hypnagogic hallucinations which is when your brain is awake and asleep at the same time. These hallucinations are usually accompanied by a terrible feeling of doom. They’re scary but are a sleep disorder.

My psychosis often begins with the whispered voices that I can never quite understand. They move if I try to find them. I progress to seeing figures move out of the shadows and follow me around. It  becomes scary but you kind of get used to them and can often not want/face help (as others have described). That you’re aware and want help may be a good sign (maybe). 

Stay away from the weed and try your best to get sleep even if you leave the light on. Hope you feel better soon."

They lived out there and know their shit about survival. They save people stranded on the regular. Crossing the red centre is like driving across the US with no midwest and no cities between New York and LA. It’s dangerous and we know it yet some of us still die along with tourists. Not to be taken lightly. I’ve been to Alice Springs in the middle of the desert and Uluru is a huge tourist destination many Aussies visit so even so, we see the desert in huge numbers."

And things aren’t within driving distance - Australia is as big as the US. It’s massive and the centre is just empty, like days of driving empty. I’ve personally been to the snowfields, rainforest, regular forests, beaches from the south eastern tip to the north eastern tip etc Have seen snakes, kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, an echidna, and a wombat in the wild. And spiders of course - the dangerous and the harmless but huge /shudder. Australians regularly drive long distances but the centre is dead and dangerous - you don’t want a breakdown driving out there. Plenty of tourists don’t understand how vast it is and get into real trouble or die.

There are also programs that reduce the risk of reoffending for both paedohiles (though it’s very difficult) and general creeps because that feedback loop is a real thing.

BipolarReddit,evkfmfo,t1_evkc5ph,1564580760.0,"Yes and the definitions change too. The presence of psychosis is the standard measure, it’s just hard to determine what was in someone’s mind as they did things, especially when they may not remember themselves. That’s why hospitalisation/prison are often mentioned alongside mania because the person becomes out of touch with reality plus has energy to burn and so comes in contact with health officials. In hypomania that can usually be avoided even though the behaviour can be inappropriate and almost out of control."

BipolarReddit,evkb2qw,t1_evk8pvc,1564578627.0,That’s why it can be tough to determine which is which but anything short of psychosis is classified as hypomania. I get pretty severe psychosis with depression so I know what it’s like but I don’t get it with my ups so they are still classified as hypomania. Psychosis plus that really high energy = mania.
BipolarReddit,evk1lba,t1_evi32yt,1564573849.0,"Hypomania can have disastrous impacts on your life and can most certainly be a cause for serious regret. Spending sprees, sexual inhibition, alcohol and drug abuse, dangerous behaviour, gambling, fines, leaving/starting relationships, irrational and inappropriate behaviour at work that can lead to job loss, just to name a few. Mania and hypomania can be a straightforward thing to determine in many people but difficult to tell apart in some, depending on their presentation and symptoms."
