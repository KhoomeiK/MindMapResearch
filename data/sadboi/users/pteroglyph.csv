Anxiety,fj2z928,t3_faz1uo,1582959730.0,"Sorry to hear, I used to get severe anxiety from sending emails!  

To the point where I'd type what I wanted to write in notepad, psyche myself up to open Gmail, carefully make sure I write the correct email address and subject line, re-read the email 10,000 times and then spend the next few hours trying to psyche myself up to click send...  

Once I finally managed to do it (I'd be sweating and a mess) I would close down every program, turn off my computer and hide in a different room until I calmed down!  

Everything is much better now and even writing this seems silly.  

Be proud of yourself for making the call in the first place, takes confidence which you managed to find and build, so feel good about it!  
I try to see view things like this in a much more basic way now.  

""I needed to do the thing, so I did the thing""
Try to be more impulsive, as soon as you let any challenging tasks linger they start to fester. 
You already know what you need to do and how to do it, your brain is just trying to give you every possible and ridiculous outcome, to the point where it makes you fuck up.
Act instinctively and you'll do the right thing.  
Get her done! You got this champ!"
synthwaveproducers,fiv31ih,t3_ex58ol,1582752919.0,"Hi! 
Dunno if anyone is still checking this thread but this is my first ever attempt at writing or recording anything like this.  


I normally play/write in a tech metal band but this was really fun to work on and made a welcome change from screaming and distorted guitars!   


I'm definitely going to do more, not sure if it's proper synthwave but it's what came out....
Thanks for looking! :)
