atheism,fr5fn4p,t1_fr4fbal,1589907777.0,"Yeah, there are a couple of factors running in parallel here and it doesn't have to be the case that either all of the factors are true or none of them are. Religions have promoted cooperation and still do, and the extraordinary claims of religions are absurd and undermine critical thinking. I don't know exactly how to weigh one against the other, but I do at least suspect that their overall usefulness at getting people to cooperate is outweighed by how badly their large cooperating groups have cultivated a habit of anti-critical thinking in an environment where the extraordinary claims that might underpin their cooperation aren't useful at solving complex, global problems like climate change and pandemics. And it makes them particularly vulnerable to demagogues and con-artists.

Religions happened to serve as baskets of ideas around which social groups could organize and *cooperate* to achieve more than the could if they didn't cooperate. It wasn't that any particular religion's extraordinary claims were *necessary* to afford its social group cooperative success. However, in lots of cases those extraordinary claims were *sufficient* at the time to foster the *necessary cooperation* to achieve this or that productive thing. But it was always the cooperation that ultimately produced the productive thing. That's made obvious by the fact that different groups with different baskets of often mutually exclusive extraordinary claims achieved similar useful and productive things.

If you want to build a big, tall tower, then you need lots of people to cooperate to do it. You could have two groups in totally different places both building similar big, tall towers. One was motivated to cooperate because they thought invisible dragons and not invisible elephants would kill only all women over 25 years old if they didn't cooperate to build towers. The other was motivated to cooperate because they thought that invisible elephants and not invisible dragons would kill only all boys under 25 years old if they didn't cooperate. Incompatible, extraordinary beliefs that produced big, tall towers. The particulars of the beliefs didn't do it. It was the fact that both sets of absurd beliefs happened to gear believers toward *cooperation*.

<door opens, in walks attribution error>

Religious people, as a group, have tended to fall victim to the attribution error of thinking that it was very specifically *their* extraordinary beliefs that made tower building possible. They know they believed thus and so bullshit, and they know they did in fact make a big tower, and they tend to be completely oblivious to the fact that there is some non-religious principle mixed in with the basket of their ideas that can account for the tower entirely on its own, regardless of all the specifically religious beliefs they've got in their belief basket. In other words, you could build towers with no religious beliefs at all in a population that simply recognize the need for cooperation to build tall towers.

They've made a habit of this kind of attribution error. Mormons, for example, absolutely cherish the idea of telling people that if you do Mormon things like read specific religious books that contain some decent moral stories, and hang out in groups of pretty nice Mormon people doing generally nice things like having cookouts and making food drive donations, and you happen to feel kind of good whilst doing those things, then that good feeling ***is*** a super power communicating to you the truth of ***all*** the ideas in the Mormon basket of ideas. They simply fail to notice that somebody might feel good doing Mormony things simply because some Mormony things have totally general, completely a-religious parts that are just generally good and make people feel good quite apart from the specific religious details. It's the same type of attribution error.

Religions train people into a habit of this particular failure of critical thought, and other failures related to it. A lot of the time it's innocuous. But when issues pop up, like a fucking global pandemic, having enormous numbers of people who've spent their entire lives cultivating this particular kind of bad thinking is, well, not ideal, no matter how many fancy and beautiful tall towers they've helped build in the past."
atheism,fr52py1,t1_fr45apd,1589901448.0,"You're not gonna like the research that's been done into this, but it is helpful in at least getting a picture of what's likely going on.

This is from [Bob Altemeyer's investigations](https://theauthoritarians.org/Downloads/TheAuthoritarians.pdf) into what he calls ""Right-Wing Authoritarianism"" (RWA). Just to head a popular criticism of his work off at the pass, ""Right-Wing Authoritarianism"" does not refer to a political persuasion, it refers to a personality tendency that can present itself in somebody with either politically right or politically left beliefs. I think it was an unfortunate name for the personality tendency he studied. Here are his own words about it:

>Because the submission occurs to traditional authority, I call these followers rightwing authoritarians. I’m using the word “right” in one of its earliest meanings, for in Old English “riht” (pronounced “writ”) as an adjective meant lawful, proper, correct, doing what the authorities said. (And when someone did the lawful thing back then, maybe the authorities said, with a John Wayne drawl, “You got that riht, pilgrim!”)

Somebody can be leftist and an RWA. As it happens, at least right now in America, there are far more politically right RWAs than politically left RWAs. Anyway, here's some of the stuff relevant to your observation and question.

>I asked a large sample of parents to respond to the following proposition: “If we have faith in Jesus, accepting him as our personal savior and asking forgiveness of our sins, we will be saved, no matter what kind of life we live afterwards.” Forty-two percent of the Christian high fundamentalists agreed with that statement. If that indicates the attitude of fundamentalists in general, a huge number of people are swilling in cheap grace. They fully expect that when the saints go marching in, they’re gonna be in that number because they once uttered a magic spell. The lives they’ve lived since are irrelevant, they believe.  
>  
>Life Without Guilt. That helps explain the hypocrisy many people find among “the saved.” But it doesn’t really account for the self-righteousness. After all, you still knows you’ve sinned--even if you have a “Get Out of Hell Free”card tucked up your sleeve. So why do fundamentalists think they sin so much less than everyone else? The answer may involve how they have learned to handle guilt, thanks again to their religious instruction.  
>  
>What do you do when you have done something morally wrong? What are you most likely to do to get over the guilt, to feel forgiven, to be at peace with yourself? Here are some possibilities.  
>  
>\- I ask God for forgiveness, by prayer, going to Confession, or some other religious act.  
>  
>\- I go out and do something nice for someone else, a “third party” not involved in what I did.  
>  
>\- I rationalize the bad act. I tell myself it was not so bad, that I had no choice, etc.  
>  
>\- I talk to someone close, such as a good friend or relative, about what I did.  
>  
>\- I get very busy with some chore, assignment, or job to take my mind off what I did.  
>  
>\- I discuss what I did with those who may have suffered, and make it up to them.  
>  
>\- Nothing; I just forget it.  
>  
>OK, whatever you typically do, how well does this work? How completely forgiven do you feel after you have done this?  
>  
>\- 0 = Not at all; I still feel just as guilty as before.  
>  
>\- 1 = A little less guilty  
>  
>\- 2 = Somewhat less guilty  
>  
>\- 3 = Moderately less guilty  
>  
>\- 4 = Appreciably less guilty  
>  
>\- 5 = Much less guilty  
>  
>\- 6 = Completely free of guilt  
>  
>*Most Christian fundamentalists who have answered these questions in my studies said they ask God for forgiveness.* ***And you know what, that makes them feel remarkably cleansed. Their average response on the “How completely forgiven?” question was nearly a 5. Again, it’s just a verbal thing. No admission of wrong-doing to injured parties is required, no restitution, and no change in behavior.*** But it works really well: Instant Guilt-Be-Gone; just add a little prayer. And why wouldn’t you sin again, since it’s so easy to erase the transgression with your Easy-off, Easy-on religious practice?  
>  
>**Fundamentalists therefore might feel little after-effect of their wrong-doings twitching away in their psyches.** They have been to the River Jordan and had all their sins washed away, often on a weekly basis just like doing the laundry. But this very likely contributes to self-righteousness, and let’s remember that self-righteousness appears to be the major releaser of authoritarian aggression. So it could come down to this: “Hello Satan!” Yum, sin! “Get thee behind me, Satan!” Whack-whack whack!  
>  
>***The non-fundamentalists in my samples did not have it so good. Their major ways of handling guilt were to discuss the immoral act with those who may have suffered and make it up to them (which they were twice as likely to do as fundamentalist were), or to talk with a friend about what they had done. Whatever they tried, it did not remove most of the guilt; their responses to the “How completely forgiven?” question averaged less than 3. But the residual guilt may help them avoid doing the same thing again, and when someone asks them how moral they are compared to other people, the unresolved, festering guilt may remind them that they are not as moral as they’d like to be.***"

Vive,fqpmw50,t1_fqpg2vn,1589550016.0,">It will probably be a few years before PCs catch up to the speed of the PS5 due to its efficiency.

I reckon ""a few years"" will mean a very long time (5+ years) in technology time before even high end PCs can match the data transfer *efficiency* of the consoles, particularly the PS5.

Do you have a view on the extent to which that will affect user experience across devices in the same settings? My hunch is that it won't really make that much of a difference and the same metrics that have always been the primary drivers of performance difference (CPU speed, core counts, raw GPU power) will again play the dominant role in what users experience.

While I don't expect any consumer PCs to match the PS5s data transfer efficiency (at least not for a long time), I do expect that as pci-e 4.0 ssds mature they'll get close enough (consistently a quarter, maybe half as fast) that it just won't really matter. So I'd expect one system to load a level at perceptibly instantaneous speeds, then render the game at some resolution range and framerate with, say, a basic level of ray tracing, whilst a high end PC will load a level at *nearly* instantaneous speeds, but at higher resolution, framerate, and with higher fidelity ray tracing. In other words, we'll be back to the same old game we've been playing for decades.

So my suspicion is that to the extent PC users long for console data transfer efficiency, console users will long for AI upscaling (DLSS 2 and beyond) and higher fidelity ray tracing. The one wild card here is whether we'll see a resurgence of RAM drives in a few years when higher end systems are sporting 64-128gb of RAM. You probably still won't be loading an entire game's assets to RAM, because I expect game sizes to balloon significantly with higher quality assets, but you could load enough stuff into RAM with that much space to play with, and intelligently swap it in and out to the SSD that you could approach console data transfer efficiency."

Economics,fqlk3jj,t1_fqi05cg,1589460134.0,"Appreciate the thoughtful post. I honestly don't feel confident in how to think through America's future right now. It's clear that we need a stronger social safety net, but we don't seem to have a political system with the right appetite and motivations to create a sufficiently strong one within the time-frame relevant to the current situation, even if we could see the right appetite and motivations emerge in the years to come (which would be good, just not good enough for *right now*).

American psychology seems to be playing a significant role in how we're handling this crisis, or how we can expect to be able to handle this crisis. What I mean by that is that in America we have a relatively high proportion of the population dogmatically attached to anti-cooperative, anti-government, anti-compromise, and simple-minded-rights ideas. I don't think they're a majority of the population, but they're a sufficiently large population and a sufficiently active one that they seem to be driving the car, so to speak. 

Because of their tendency to agitate for and contribute to political causes, it seems to me that it's implausible to plan our future around more socially minded solutions (because enough people are against socially minded solutions). Thus, it seems to me that our best course of action, in terms of what we have a realistic hope of achieving, is simply reducing both economic and health harms *given* a sufficient proportion of the population will behave against socially minded solutions.

In other words, we simply have to stop benchmarking ourselves against other country's performance where their populations are more socially conscious. We're not very socially conscious and cooperative here, and so we've just got to try to do as good as you can realistically expect a population with that attitude to do. I'm rambling. Sorry."

I'm pretty fit, low BMI (\~19.5), but have had a pretty shit diet most of my life. Since my last blood draw a year ago indicated very mildly elevated cholesterol I've pretty well dialed in my diet to something far more healthy (e.g. significant reduction in processed foods, less red meat, more fish, a lot more fruits and veggies) and have increased my exercise routine. This year's blood seemed to show the fruits of that labor with cholesterol now within health limits (barely).

I understand repeat blood tests will be the most helpful and only my doctor can interpret those in light of my full history, so I'm not so much asking for a specific interpretation of my results as I'm asking whether there's any good evidence at all that healthier diet and exercise habits are *at least* associated with lower WBC.

Related: Is the ""normal"" WBC range set based on what's normal in a given population? If so, and a population is made up of a pretty significant proportion of obese people with baseline higher inflammation, then is the ""normal"" range skewed to reflect the contribution of this subset of the population?

Hematology,fq6e855,t3_gg3c04,1589129814.0,"Just had a wellness check with somewhat unusual CBC results. Brief history. About a month before my wellness check my allergies kicked in and I got an Rx of hydroxyzine to cover both my allergies and help me sleep through the general anxiety from all the crazy shit going on. At that time I reported my allergy symptoms as consistent with most years, though my throat did seem a bit scratchier (very mild soreness) which was a bit more than I've experienced before with seasonal allergies but nothing so pronounced I thought that much of it. Otherwise, I felt totally fine.

Fast forward to recent CBC results. Everything was normal except WBC. 

* WBC 2.92 (x10\^3/uL)
* neutrophils 58.2%
* lymphocytes 30.8%
* monocytes 8.9%
* eosinophils 1.4%
* basophils 0.7%

If I'm doing this right, then that implies \~1,700 neutrophils/(10\^3/uL), which doesn't fall within typical neutropenia guidelines (as far as I can tell), but is pretty close. My WBC from years past floats around between 3.75 and 4.40, with neutrophil and lymphocyte %s moving around (\~70/20 to \~60/30).

Here's where it got kind of interesting and where (it seems) my doc is thinking back to what I said about my allergies a month prior. They want me back this week for a second CBC plus coronavirus antibody tests*.* I didn't take the opportunity to ask much into it, but would somebody who's had a (mild) sars-cov-2 infection have a low WBC, and in particular low neutrophil count (relative to their baseline)?

* [Hardcore Saving Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19914) \- You get one save slot, and you can't save or autosave. The only way to save is to sleep, use saviors brew, or save and quit the game. I think it's really fun to combine this with mods that keep the game going if you die, like...
* Mark of Arkay - I configure so that upon death I respawn in a nearby town. I also set it to remove a random number of items. A crystal thingy gets dropped where I died. I have one chance to retrieve the crystal (and my items, including gold), or that stuff get's permanently destroyed. Gives an incentive to try to very carefully retrieve my shit and makes for some interesting gameplay when I die in dangerous situations.   
Sometimes I'm forced to delay getting my stuff in an effort to build up supplies, but that also carries risk because I could die before retrieving and then I lose everything. I also apply a curse that damages my health, stamina, and magic a little bit until I retrive the crystal thingy, which adds another incentive to go back into danger. I think it adds a fun element to gameplay. Unfortunately Mark of Arkay was [removed from Nexus](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/fh7q86/mark_of_arkay_sse/) for some reason, but if anyone wants it, I'm sure it can be found ;) I think it's better than Respawn - Death Overhaul in that it's more configurable. But Respawn is good, too.

I also play with a bunch of other stuff like Frostfall, Campfire, much harder difficulty, limited arrow capacity, realistic capacity, more enemies, and stuff like that. With Frostfall you can disable fast travel if you really want to be hardcore, but that gets old after a while so I retain fast travel. The main ones are Hardcore Saving Overhaul and a respawn mod. With those you can play a persistent game that isn't broken up by traditional saving and stays consistent even when you ""die"". I just imagine I'm saved by a stranger and left in a nearby town. It's fun."

I raise this because there was recently a video of two doctors (urgent care owner/operators, apparently) on Youtube that got shared around.

And then they went on to repeatedly make statistical claims about the general population by extrapolating disease burdens from the biased population of people tested for infection (as opposed to random anti-body testing). It became painfully obvious that, however good these guys are as physicians, they were complete novices at statistical inference and they were making all kids of text book, stat 101, inference errors. It was seriously fucking embarrassing to watch.

Anyway, it's stuff like that that makes me wonder how sharp a lot of ""experts"" are. The methods of scientific, statistical, and mathematical analysis aren't trade secrets, which means anyone sharp enough can demonstrate when somebody's totally overstating or failing to do the math, but the thing is, most people just don't want to take the time because it does take more time to analyze things rigorously and carefully but it takes almost no time at all to come to a conclusion and shout about it when you're an idiot.

It's a constellation of factors that are best described by research into the psychological tendency of authoritarianism (right-wing authoritarians, or RWAs, in the literature), and from that research it's clear that even if greed is a component, it's not exclusively or even mostly motivating these folks. For example, consider these excerpts from Bob Altemeyer's book [The Authoritarians](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxxylK6fR81rckQxWi1hVFFRUDg/view).

>Sitting in the jury room of the Port Angeles, Washington court house in 1989, Mary Wegmann might have felt she had suddenly been transferred to a parallel universe in some Twilight Zone story. For certain fellow-jury members seemed to have attended a different trial than the one she had just witnessed. They could not remember some pieces of evidence, they invented evidence that did not exist, and they steadily made erroneous inferences from the material that everyone could agree on. Encountering my research as she was later developing her Ph.D. dissertation project, she suspected the people who “got it wrong” had been mainly high RWAs. So she recruited a sample of adults from the Clallam County jury list, and a group of students from Peninsula College and gave them various memory and inference tests. For example, they listened to a tape of two lawyers debating a school segregation case on a McNeil/Lehrer News Hour program. **Wegmann found High RWAs indeed had more trouble remembering details of the material they’d encountered, and they made more incorrect inferences on a reasoning test than others usually did. Overall, the authoritarians had lots of trouble simply thinking straight.**  
>  
>Intrigued, I gave the inferences test that Mary Wegmann had used to two large samples of students at my university. In both studies high RWAs went down in flames more than others did. They particularly had trouble figuring out that an inference or deduction was wrong. To illustrate, suppose they had gotten the following syllogism:  
>  
>All fish live in the sea.  
>  
>Sharks live in the sea..  
>  
>Therefore, sharks are fish.  
>  
>The conclusion does not follow, but high RWAs would be more likely to say the reasoning is correct than most people would. If you ask them why it seems right, they would likely tell you, “Because sharks are fish.” In other words, **they thought the reasoning was sound because they agreed with the last statement. If the conclusion is right, they figure, then the reasoning must have been right. Or to put it another way, they don’t “get it” that the reasoning matters--especially on a reasoning test.**

So there's a tendency among people who score high on RWA personality tests to demonstrate an impaired ability to *reason*. But wait, there's more!

>You can appreciate their short-fall in critical thinking by how easily authoritarian followers get alarmed by things. When I asked a group of students if the most serious problem in our country today was the drug problem and the crime it causes, a solid majority of the high RWAs said yes.1 When I asked another group if the destruction of the family was our most serious problem, the great majority of authoritarians in that group said it was. When I asked a third group if our most serious problem was the loss of religion and commitment to God, a solid majority of those authoritarians said yes. And a solid majority of the high RWAs in a fourth group agreed the destruction of the environment was our biggest problem. We’ve apparently got a truck load of “biggest” problems.  
>  
>It’s much harder to catch low RWAs doing this sort of thing. When someone says one of their favorite issues is our biggest problem (e.g. the destruction of individual freedom, or poverty), they seem to ask themselves, “Is it?”--whereas authoritarian followers usually respond, “It is!” So what happens when a demagogue asserts “The Jews are our biggest problem” (or feminists or the liberal press or the United Nations or Iraq--you name it)? Are high RWAs likely to make an independent, thoughtful evaluation of that statement? Or are they going to get riled up and demand repression or censorship or a war? “Yes sir, we’ve got trouble, right here in River City, Trouble, with a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for pool!”

Does any of this sound familiar? How about this?

>As I said earlier, authoritarians’ ideas are poorly integrated with one another. It’s as if each idea is stored in a file that can be called up and used when the authoritarian wishes, even though another of his ideas--stored in a different file-- basically contradicts it. We all have some inconsistencies in our thinking, but authoritarians can stupify you with the inconsistency of their ideas. Thus they may say they are proud to live in a country that guarantees freedom of speech, but another file holds, “My country, love it or leave it.” The ideas were copied from trusted sources, often as sayings, but the authoritarian has never “merged files” to see how well they all fit together.  
>  
>It’s easy to find authoritarians endorsing inconsistent ideas. Just present slogans and appeals to homey values, and then present slogans and bromides that invoke opposite values. The yea-saying authoritarian follower is likely to agree with all of them. Thus I asked both students and their parents to respond to, “When it comes to love, men and women with opposite points of view are attracted to each other.” Soon afterwards, in the same booklet, I pitched “Birds of a feather flock together when it comes to love.” High RWAs typically agreed with both statements, even though they responded to the two items within a minute of each other.  
>  
>But that’s the point: they don’t seem to scan for self-consistency as much as most people do. Similarly they tended to agree with “A government should allow total freedom of expression, even it if threatens law and order” and “A government should only allow freedom of expression so long as it does not threaten law and order.” And “Parents should first of all be gentle and tender with their children,” and “Parents should first of all be firm and uncompromising with their children; spare the rod and spoil the child.”

It looks like there's a theme here to do with measurable disorder in the thinking of a certain population of people. One more interesting finding.

Professor Altemeyer describes a fictional story about a homosexual activist, Mr. Langley, who leads a  pro-homosexual protest for marriage equality on the steps of a state house. At some point some counter protesters show up with signs that read things like, ""The Family is Sacred"" and ""Marriage is between a man and a woman"". The pro-homosexual activist calls out from his stand, ""There are some of the people who are trying to keep this bill from passing. I say we run them out of here right now. Let's show everybody we mean business."" Upon hearing this, members of the pro-homosexual protest physically attack the counter protesters. Later, Mr. Langley is found guilty of inciting a riot and may be sentenced between 0 and 18 months.

That story is told to one half of the sample. A mirror image story is told to the other half. In the mirror story Mr. Langely is a leader in the pro-traditional-marriage group and is leading a protest on the state house steps in favor of traditional marriage. The counter protesters in this version are the pro-homosexual activists. Again, Langley incites riot, is found guilty, and is to be sentenced to between 0 and 18 months in jail.

The question to both sets is how long should Langley's sentence be. You can probably see where this is going. People with low authoritarian tendency imposed the same sentences upon both the gay and straight advocating Mr. Langley. People with high authoritarian tendency consistently give the homosexual advocate more jail time than the anti-gay-marriage advocate. People with high authoritarian tendency punish the person (when they happen to dislike the person's lifestyle or opinions) and the crime. Low authoritarians punish the crime, by and large, which is what you want in a judicial system (i.e. blind justice). There's very real reason to worry about the army of unqualified and highly conservative judges the GOP is pushing through.

Here's the thing. People vary in authoritarian tendency. There are lots of people at the bottom, in the middle, and at the top. Consider all the people in the top -- high ranking authoritarian tendency (high RWA). Now create a ""news"" channel that scratches their fear of practically everything they don't understand. Give them illogical arguments, but with conclusions they'll tend to agree with, even though the conclusion doesn't follow from the premises (they won't notice, apparently). And just imagine what you could do with that. It probably won't be that difficult to imagine."

Coronavirus,fnvrte8,t1_fnvpz9s,1587303052.0,"I don't disagree. I'm trying to point out that even if it were just a flu bro, it would still be a worse burden on the population than flu for no other reason than its much higher contagiousness and we would still need to adopt the same measures we're adopting to mitigate a worse population level outcome than a bad flu year. And I'm also saying that this is sufficiently nuances that a lot of people simply won't understand it."
Coronavirus,fnvooos,t1_fnvm3wa,1587300537.0,"While evidence builds in favor of a low mortality rate (good), it also builds for [high contagiousness](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340512166_High_Contagiousness_and_Rapid_Spread_of_Severe_Acute_Respiratory_Syndrome_Coronavirus_2) (bad).

It's possible you could have a contagion no more deadly than flu with respect to the odds of death of any individual, but that is also several times more contagious than flu, and, therefore, infects several times more people and produces a more severe health care burden on *populations*. In fact, that's a good candidate for the situation we may actually be in.

Assume this coronavirus is no more fatal than flu. So, both kill 0.1% of the populations they infect. One contagion is such that it will only end up infecting 10% of a population, and the other is such that it will end up infecting 50% of a population. For the United States under these assumptions we'd expect flu to kill \~33,000 and coronavirus to kill \~165,000. 5x more people, and not because the contagion is any nastier to any given human body, but only because it's better at getting around (there are reasons to think it's also nastier, but let's just set all that aside).

It looks like we might get away with less than 165,000 deaths, but we've paid quite a lot to buy that outcome by essentially using modifications to our social behavior as a stand in for a vaccine. In other words, we might engineer an outcome similar to a bad flu season, but we'll have done it without a vaccine and almost entirely through behavioral change. Given the costs involved to match the outcome of flu (a virus for which we have vaccines), what a case for vaccines!

If that turns out to be the case, it's just the sort of nuance at least half the population won't be able to grasp, and we'll endlessly hear about how we destroyed the economy for something no more dangerous than flu."

There's a large population of people who won't have a sophisticated enough view of this to appreciate how better outcomes at any given moment are necessarily the product of whatever measures have been in place in the past. So we're probably gonna notice lots of people sincerely saying things like, ""see this isn't so bad now, what was all the fuss about?"", and they'll fail to grasp the fact that it's not as bad as it could have been precisely because we adopted certain fairly strict changes to behavior."

>Two different hypotheses may be considered to explain the change in IL-6 production during the immune response to viral infection: (i) the increased ability of some viral strains to overcome the immune response using a variety of evasion strategies ([Beachboard and Horner, 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B3)), and consequently up-regulate the production of IL-6 as a result of increased viral loads, and (ii) polymorphisms in the IL-6 gene promoter stimulating overexpression of IL-6 during the immune response, a fact that has been shown to correlate with HBV progression ([Lan et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B26)). **This last hypothesis might explain clinical reports correlating IL-6 overexpression with exacerbation of clinical outcomes in a sub-group of individuals during an outbreak caused by a single virus strain.**

So it's possible there exists a population of people who are disposed to overexpression of IL-6 during immune response, generally; **AND** this particular virus up-regulates IL-6 (by evasion, which allows increased viral load to develop, that then encourages a surge in IL-6).

Understand I'm just a nobody speculating here, but this could explain the cases of otherwise very healthy but very poor outcomes. The population of humans with ""polymorphisms in the IL-6 gene promoter stimulating overexpression of IL-6 during the immune response"" is obviously a sub-group of the set of all humans, and I'd wager it's a pretty small sub-group of the population as a whole, if these conditions do exist. That could mean that interspersed among the human population are some people, spanning the health spectrum (some super healthy, some not), with a disposition to overexpress IL-6 during any given immune response. Now just take the sub-group of young, healthy people. You'd expect some (probably small) proportion of otherwise, young and healthy people to possess these polymorphisms. Now subject that sub-group to a pathogen that up-regulates IL-6, and, boom, there are your statistically infrequent but definitely occurring instances of severe illness and death in young, otherwise healthy people.

>We next determined the profile and the polarity of inflammatory cytokines produced by infected Calu-3 cells and investigated how these virally induced epithelial cytokines would affect the intrinsic functions of Mφ and DC. Here, we show that Calu-3 cells responded to SARS-CoV infection by secreting several inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), in a delayed and dose-dependent manner. We also demonstrate that these SARS-CoV-induced Calu-3 cytokines are potent in modulating various functions of Mφ and DC, including cytokine production, phagocytosis, and activation of naïve T cells. **Finally, we also identify IL-6 and IL-8 as the likely cytokines exerting a negative impact on the ability of DC to priming naïve T cells, thereby providing an intriguing mechanism for SARS-CoV to evade host immune responses by delaying or even diminishing the development of adaptive immune responses.**

>The last potential mechanism links IL-6 with the negative co-stimulator molecules programmed cell death one (PD-1) and its ligand (PDL-1). Under normal conditions, PD-1 and PDL-1 prevent autoimmunity by inducing T-cell regulation and maintaining self-tolerance ([Bardhan et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B2)). However, during chronic viral infections, T-cell ligation of PD-1 by PDL-1, expressed on infected cells, alters immunity against viruses by preventing T-cell generation and expansion ([Bardhan et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B2)). Experimental evidence evaluating the induction of PD-1 and PDL-1 after infection with TMEV in normal and transgenic IL-6 mice showed that the excessive production of IL-6 displayed by transgenic mice after infection positively correlates with increased up-regulation of PD-1 and PDL-1 molecules in the central nervous system, and consequently with reduced CD8+ cytolytic function ([Jin et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B22)). Interestingly, PD-1 and PDL-1 up-regulation appeared to be the result of the cooperative action between IL-6 and interferon type I, with IL-6 essential to the expression of maximum levels of PDL-1 ([Jin et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B22)).  
>  
>Evidence from clinical studies in humans and animals have also linked the increased systemic levels of IL-6 with the exacerbation of clinical outcomes involving viral pathogens. In this context, increased levels of IL-6 in serum has been reported in human patients chronically affected with Andes virus ([Angulo et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B1)), influenza virus ([Zheng et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B48)), HBV ([Torre et al., 1994](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B41)), hepatitis C virus ([Spanakis et al., 2002](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B38)), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; [Borges et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B4)), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus ([Ergonul et al., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B13)), and Chikungunya virus ([Chirathaworn et al., 2013](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B7)). Similar results have been reported in pigs and ponies infected with VSV and influenza virus, respectively, where the virulence of different strains might be positively correlated with both local and systemic detection of IL-6 ([Wattrang et al., 2003](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B44); [Velazquez-Salinas et al., 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B42)). Additionally, transcriptome analysis of persistently infected pharyngeal tissues collected from cattle with foot and mouth disease virus showed a local increase of IL-6 expression ([Pacheco et al., 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B31)), suggesting that overexpression of IL-6 might be a possible mechanism favoring persistence of some viruses. Similarly, in HIV-infected individuals increased levels of IL-6 positively correlated with levels of residual viremia, while in ectocervical tissues, the presence of IL-6 was correlated with enhanced transcriptional levels of HIV-1 ([Rollenhagen and Asin, 2011](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B35)).

This last hypothesis might explain clinical reports correlating IL-6 overexpression with exacerbation of clinical outcomes in a sub-group of individuals during an outbreak caused by a single virus strain. Interestingly, this is consistent with experimental evidence in transgenic IL-6 mice (discussed below).  
>  
>Experimental evidence supports the observation that overexpression of IL-6 during the viral immune response might induce viral persistence by impairing the polarization and functionality of Th1 cells and the lytic capacity of CD8 T-cells through different mechanisms, leading to chronic infections ([Figure 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#F1)). As a consequence of the constant antigen stimulation, CD8 T-cells become unresponsive and fail to develop into memory CD8 T-cells, a situation that limits viral clearance ([Shin and Wherry, 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B37); [Bardhan et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B2)). Increased levels of IL-6 might also exacerbate the immunopathology during chronic infections by increasing inflammation followed by cytokine secretion and cellular recruitment as described during autoimmune diseases ([Srirangan and Choy, 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B39)). In fact, this condition of increased inflammation may be an advantage for some viruses by providing new cellular targets for subsequent viral infections ([Pingen et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01057/full#B34))."

>Interviewer: ...have you been briefed by the CDC?

>Trump: I have, and...

>Interviewer: **Are there worries about a pandemic?**  
>  
>Trump: **No. Not at all. And we have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s — going to be just fine.**

This is the most toddler thing I've ever seen in an adult in my entire life. This is how my young children used to process the world (4 years and younger). Often when they were being brats I'd call them out on it and they'd stop whatever shitty behavior they were up to and say, ""I'm not!"". Well, yes, is true they stopped the shitty behavior, but it's also true that they had done it. I realized that in their minds the fact that they were not doing it after I told them to stop meant that they either hadn't done it or shouldn't be judged on the basis of the behavior they definitely had done (because they had stopped it).

It's a temporal confusion that reveals either misunderstanding and confusion about the past (because children don't understand time very well) or misunderstanding and confusion about how their culpability relates to the past, or both. Trump has this confusion, and he's an adult human, and he's the President of the United States.

He now knows it's a pandemic, so he's always known it was a pandemic. I suspect a lot of what seems like prolific lying isn't merely because he's a malicious, lying, shithead. I suspect a lot of it is nothing more than a product of some cognitive dysfunction, or under-development.

What he said in the past doesn't enter into his self-assessment in the present, and if what he's done in the past is out of harmony with what he ought to have done, but is doing now, then he shouldn't be held responsible for his past behavior because from his perspective, *he doesn't see his past behavior*. It literally might not make sense to him that people try to hold him to account to what he's said or done in the past, because he's unable to agree that he said or did anything in the past that's out of harmony with what he now thinks or does. 

Whatever he's doing now, he's always done. Whatever he thinks now, he's always thought. He's never made a mistake and nothing is his fault because from his perspective the past is just a reflection of his present.

From the outside it's easy to see all his contradictions. From his perspective there are none, because his present is his full picture of the past. There isn't anything else."
politics,fm9vwh5,t1_fm9jty9,1585877764.0,"Oh wow. I take that as high praise. As enthusiastic as I appear about Cipolla's essay, I want to urge caution with it, because he does make lots of claims that he fails to support with any rigorous evidence. Nevertheless, I think it's a sensible thesis on its face, and is, at the very least, super thought provoking.

Since you brought up education, I'll offer some thoughts on that. When I first stumbled on Cipolla's essay, the thesis resonated with me and with how I perceived society around me, and my immediate reaction was, ""education!"" I dwelt on that for some time, until it occurred to me that I'd missed his point.

If you take Cipolla seriously (and again, maybe we shouldn't, but let's), then it isn't quite right to say something like, ""our education system isn't making enough smart kids"". And, to be fair, maybe that's not what you're suggesting, but it's at least the sort of thing I initially thought. Again, though, stupidity isn't correlated with education. Cipolla seems to believe that the very well educated will still have their å.

However, it occurred to me that I was thinking about education in the wrong sort of way. Cipolla's whole framing of stupidity simply has nothing to do with whether or not people have the right familiarity with the topics we in the West ordinarily associate with education. His framing of stupidity is more an *ethical framing*, because it's about how individuals behave *relative to their peers*. He says to be stupid is to be *""a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses""*. That's it. There's nothing else to it. It's about behavior -- not about how much mastery one has of medical knowledge, or of obscure mathematical theory, or how much business acumen one possesses. It's just about how one treats other people. It's ethics.

There's a sense in which it is about education, just not what we (or I) typically think of when we think of education in the West -- it's about *ethical* education. There is a domain in the standard curriculum that's kinda supposed to touch this -- civics -- but it's largely neglected in most of the West, probably because it's very easy to see how productive other sorts of knowledge can be to produce widgets, and harder to appreciate the payoff of ethical education and civics. Maybe this is what you were getting at when you wrote, ""There's no accountability."" As I sketched at the end of the post you responded to, holding bandits with overtones of stupidity *accountable* to laws helps them from proliferating in positions of power where the imbalance in bandits and the helpless cedes too much influence to the purely stupid, and destroys stable society (refer to Cipolla's matrix).

I can't remember if it was before or after I read Cipolla's paper, but at least around that time I ended up down a rabbit hole into the world of cooperation theory, and ended up reading its seminal work -- [The Evolution of Cooperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation) by Robert Axelrod. I've since read it once more and it's a candidate for the most important book I've ever read in my life, and if I could, I'd make it required reading for humans.

What Axelrod does is rigorously demonstrate the stability of behavioral strategies that we might naively call ""niceness"", or cooperation, or not-being-stupid (to circle back to Cipolla) in systems where things that act have to perform their actions in a setting made up of other things that also act, and everything interacts over, and over again. Being stupid, in Cipolla's sense, is essentially *anti-cooperation,* but in the most ludicrous and asinine way (no gains for anybody!). But a more intriguing point is that he demonstrates that even if you're selfish, you should behave with the whole system in mind to serve your own selfishness.

It's not quite *that* simple, because it's not as if cooperation is an optimal strategy under just any conditions you might find yourself in. But I think it's easy enough to appreciate that if you could be dropped into any kind of society, and you cared about having a good chance at living a decent life, then you'd probably want to be dropped into a cooperating sort of one. But since we can't easily pick the sort of social system we're in, are there conditions we ought to encourage that could in turn raise the odds of any given system becoming a cooperating one? It turns out the answer is yes. Axelrod outlines those conditions in his book, and I think the sort of education we really ought to be thinking hard about is one that strongly encourages kids and adults to think seriously about those things. If (I hope when) you read his book it'll become immediately obvious that those things are very poorly emphasized in our society.

If you want a quick taste of Axelrods work, [here's a website](https://ncase.me/trust/) some super creative person put together that basically gives you Axelrods book in interactive form. The book is better, though, and worth the time to digest."

politics,fm8a0g8,t1_fm84xq1,1585845574.0,"I don't think that's a fair reading of Cipolla's essay at all. It makes me question whether you've read his essay. There's plenty to criticize it on (the most obvious one is that he refers to some nebulous research in support of his claims and never really offers it; which is why many believe this was just a goofy, tongue-in-cheek, academic project for him).

[eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics)\-  a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population, typically by excluding people and groups judged to be inferior, and promoting those judged to be superior.

Cipolla doesn't say anything at all about genetics, or really much at all about improving the human population. The whole tone of the essay is one of mere (if unsupported) observation about how he thinks things simply are. In fact, one of his essential points is that human stupidity isn't something you can ever hope to extinguish from the human population *and* that we should expect the human population will *always* have some, more or less, fixed proportion of stupidity that is *uncorrelated to any other human characteristic* (e.g. race, religion, education, height, hair color, etc). He refers to that fixed proportion as ""å"".

Stupidity, on his account, isn't a property born of any other characteristics. Anyone, given any background and level of education, can be found to be stupid in his sense. And the sense of stupidity he outlines has to do with how one behaves relative to other people -- stupid people, he claims, are nothing more than people who do things that harm themselves and other people (total net loss). On his view, we're just as likely to find a non-stupid poor person with no education as we are to find a stupid, wealthy, Harvard graduate; and the fact that somebody might be very adept and knowledgeable in some domain doesn't give us any information to judge whether their general behavior will be such as to impose a net loss on society.

In other words, on Cipolla's view, there isn't even a realistic way to carry out a eugenic project precisely because there's isn't an obvious way to identify and group stupid people by other obvious characteristics like gender, race, height, education or anything else.

The closest he ever comes to anything that could even remotely be considered eugenics is the bit I originally quoted at he end.

>In a country which is moving downhill, the fraction of stupid people is still equal to å; however in the remaining population one notices among those in power an alarming proliferation of the bandits with overtones of stupidity (sub-area B1 of quadrant B in figure 3) and among those not in power an equally alarming growth in the number of helpless individuals (area H in basic graph, fig.1). Such change in the composition of the non-stupid population inevitably strengthens the destructive power of the å fraction and makes decline a certainty. And the country goes to Hell.

He doesn't flesh it out more than that, but I guess you could observe that if you wanted to stop a country moving downhill, then if its moving downhill is a function of a proliferation of bandits (what we would understand to mean ""criminals"") with overtones of stupidity, we would therefore reverse the downhill trend by creating circumstances unfavorable to bandits (we call those things ""laws""). And, again, since dangerous stupidity is uncorrelated with any other human characteristics (on his view), the closest thing to a ""eugenic"" project one could infer from what he wrote would be a systems of laws that helps us catch bandits with overtones of stupidity who might otherwise ""strengthen the destructive power of the å fraction (the stupid)"". Which is all just to say, you combat dangerous stupidity by enforcing laws against predatory and socially destructive behavior. In other words, not eugenics."
politics,fm7ujwc,t1_fm7qkt7,1585837063.0,"I can't stop reflecting on Carlo Cipolla's somewhat tongue-in-cheek essay on stupidity -- [The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity](https://advanced.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/The-Basic-Laws-of-Human-Stupidity.pdf). He builds to the damning thesis (for which we're now seeing supporting evidence mount at an alarming rate) that, ""**a stupid person is the most dangerous type of person**"", and it's corollary that, ""**a stupid person is more dangerous than a bandit.**"" I'm just gonna spoil the end of his essay, because I think it's so profound (though I can't recommend the whole thing strongly enough):

Always. He always knew it. He knew it was ""very serious"" and that ""it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic"".

Remember, he knew long before March 11th how serious coronavirus was. That's why on March 9th and 10th he compared coronavirus to seasonal flu. On the 9th he told us to think about 22 coronavirus deaths versus bigger numbers of flu deaths. Think about that!

Yes, that's a Fox News link.

And you know what, on February 27th, when Trump knew how very serious a pandemic this was, he gave us the straight talk by letting us know that it would just disappear one day. ""It could get worse"", he conceded -- a comment we can be certain was informed by how very serious he knew it was -- but followed that up with ""It could maybe go away...nobody really knows"". Then again, he knew, though. Because he *always* knew it was a very serious pandemic, and, as everyone knows, very serious pandemics sometimes just go away.

See, he always knew it. That's how he suspected that we'd be at just one or two cases shortly. As I type this there are some \~189,000 known cases, over 4,000 deaths, and cases are doubling every 3-4 days. This is the kind of luck he *always knew* we'd have.

Let's hop back to a time ""long before it was called a pandemic"" and wrap this up.

That's because most of the time it's not a leopard and it's cognitively super duper easy to (mistakenly) infer that there are no leopards -- no threats worth preparing for. Being aware that there are low probability threats and preparing for them let's you relax a bit and conserve energy, which is kinda nice. 

The whole idea of government is to create cooperative structures that manage shared, low probability, but high impact and destabilizing risks. And the reason you want maximum stability (hopefully with a high dose of liberty) is so you can ""see"" into the future and make plans that you can reasonably expect to realize. 

Of course, that's made difficult if you look at government like a business and want to always cut costs at every turn to save money here and there to marginally lower the amount each citizen needs to contribute through taxes (because how much money leaves your pocket is just a really easy and immediate thing to fuss over). The easiest things anyone could think to cut are the things managing low probability risks that nobody's seen for a while, because ""hey, those guys are just sitting around doing nothing"". Then the leopard strikes. 

Even fucking Rick Perry realized that, oh yeah, you really don't want to get rid of the Department of Energy. The tragedy is that he, like an apparently terrifying proportion of the population, could't conceptually grasp any of this until he was dropped into the position of managing it and was more or less forced to intellectually grapple with what the department does. Others are being forced to grapple with these ideas right now because a fucking leopard is on the lose. Whoops!"

Well, yes, is true they stopped the shitty behavior, but it's also true that they had done it. I realized that in their minds the fact that they were not doing it after I told them to stop meant that they either hadn't done it or shouldn't be judged on the basis of the behavior they definitely had done (because they had stopped it).

Just dwell on this case. On [March 18th](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4861928/user-clip-knew-pandemic) he said this:

>I've **always** known this is a — this is a real — this is a pandemic. *I've felt it was a pandemic* ***long*** *before it was called a pandemic*. All you had to do is look at other countries. ... No, I've **always** viewed it as very serious. 

Always. He always knew it. He knew it was ""very serious"" and that ""it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic"". It was called a pandemic by WHO on [March 11th](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020). Therefore, Trump knew it was a pandemic and that it was very serious ""long"" before March 11th.

[March 10th](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-meeting-republican-senators-2/?utm_source=link&utm_medium=header) (not long before March 11th):

>With all of that being said, we’re taking this *unbelievably seriously*, and I think we’re doing a really good job.  And, again, the task force, headed up by the Vice President, has been fantastic.

No indication there that he thought it a pandemic, and his administration was taking it so seriously, he couldn't even believe it.

[March 9th](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237027356314869761), also not long before the 11th, we were told to think about this: 

>So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that! 

Remember, he knew long before March 11th how serious coronavirus was. That's why on March 9th and 10th he compared coronavirus to seasonal flu. On the 9th he told us to think about 22 coronavirus deaths versus 37,000 and 27,000 to 70,000 flu deaths. Think about that!

[March 7th](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-president-bolsonaro-brazil-working-dinner-west-palm-beach-fl/):

>PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, I’m not concerned at all.  No, I’m not.  No, we’ve done a great job.

On March 7th, also not really long before March 11th, Trump knew coronavirus had developed into a pandemic and viewed it as very serious. He knew this so much that he wasn't concerned at all.

Let's go back a little further to a time, still not long ago, but...*longer* ago.

And you know what, on February 27th, when Trump knew how very serious a pandemic this was, he gave us the straight talk about how serious it was and would be by letting us know that it would just disappear one day. ""It could get worse"", he conceded -- a comment we can be certain was informed by how very serious he knew it was -- but followed that up with ""It could maybe go away...nobody really knows"". He knew, though. Because he *always* knew!

Trump knew on Februrary 26th this was very serious and a pandemic. That's how he suspected that ""we could be at just one or two people over next short period of time"". The number of infected never, in fact, dropped. As I type this there are some \~143,000 cases and cases are doubling every 3-4 days. He knew infections would only increase, of course, because he always knew it was a very serious pandemic.

>Well, I just say that it’s, you know, a very, very small number in this country. And we’re going to try and keep it that way as much as possible. I will say, though, the H1N1, that was swine flu, commonly referred to as swine flu. And that went from around April of ’09 to April of ’10, where there were 60 million cases of swine flu. And over — actually, it’s over 13,000. I think you might have said 17. I had heard it was 13, but a lot of — a lot of deaths. And they didn’t do anything about it. Interestingly, with the swine flu, children were — in particular, they were vulnerable, sort of the opposite in that respect. But children were very vulnerable to the swine flu. But they never did close the borders. I don’t think they ever did have the travel ban. And we did. And, again, they lost at least 13,000.

Here we see Trump demonstrate his inability to make straightforward, simple comparisons, primarily as a function of his apparent inability to understand exponential growth. By the end of March 4th we had 158 confirmed cases and 11 death and experts were already producing models (and had been) that told us the future to expect (which we are now experiencing). We can be certain Trump was being exposed to this information, but simply couldn't hear it because he couldn't *grasp* it.

Notice that he, rightly, recites what happened with swine flu -- \~13,000 deaths attributed to swine flu *over 12 months*! But, again, he's demonstrating his failure to grasp the well understood urgency of this situation due to what we knew ***then*** about how infectious and dangerous *this* virus is. Today is 71 days from the first confirmed case in the United States. Johns Hopkins tracker has us at 143,055 known cases and 2,513 deaths (as I type this), and we're expected to surpass swine flu's 13,000 deaths between April 5th to the 7th (in about a week), or *77-79* days from first infection.

He'll have forgotten to have said any of that, of course, and won't ever honestly respond to any questions about this, or anything else he's ever said in the past that clearly demonstrates his incompetence. He'll hear the questions, immediately classify them as nasty, and when normal people might begin some measure of introspection and self-assessment, he'll simply launch into an angry and combative response that blames everyone else, recognizes the amazing job he sincerely seems to believe himself to have done, and then he'll move on.

Now add all the [cognitive biases we're all prone to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases), and it's recipe that can cause our worry over extreme cases to vastly exceed the odds. Consider just a few of the biases we're prone to:

[Negativity bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias) \-  Psychological phenomenon by which humans have a greater recall of unpleasant memories compared with positive memories.

[Base rate fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy) \-  The tendency to ignore general information and focus on information only pertaining to the specific case, even when the general information is more important.

Of course, the frustrating thing is how deeply embedded these biases are in our cognition. Knowing about them can help direct attention and control anxiety a *little (maybe?)*, but we're still to a large degree slaves to the cognitive shortcuts evolution's given us.

This is an excellent observation that I've been struggling to get a footing on, but haven't yet. I'm finding mixed reports of the extent of South Korea's distancing measures. Were they a super harsh lock down? Were they weaker than that? To what degree? I honestly don't know.

What seems clear, though, is that they deployed massive testing and phenomenal contact tracing, and did so relatively early in combination with at least some degree of social distancing. Whatever their degree of broad social distancing, it's clear that because of their testing and tracking systems, they were able to be more deliberate in quarantining positive results. It may be that they were able to get by with looser general distancing measures because they were able to be very deliberate in quarantining positive results. A lot of epidemiological experts do seem to think weaker distancing can work in a population that is well tested and tracked.

It's increasingly looking like it is in fact too late for the US to expect the SK model to produce SK results in the US. The two papers I posted sort of operate under that theme (i.e. they don't assume massive testing or good contact tracing). I suspect (but don't know) that models for the West are being built with those assumptions because we've missed the window in which those efforts would yield results in the face of the massive tidal wave it seems we're about to face.

As much as it pains me to say it, we may simply be forced into submission in the sense that it isn't out of the question to me that we will face the horrible choice of either enormous social disruption under a catastrophic healthcare burden, or accept unprecedented infringement upon our rights (which itself might produce enormous social disruption given our psychological tendencies and what we're used to here).

Long before this event, I had come to appreciate that sometimes things don't work out, and that a person can make choices or a serious of choices that put them in a place where there are no obvious or simple ways to get back. In some sense, I was fortunate enough to be taught that lesson sort of early. My worry right now is that as a society we've slow-walked ourselves into that sort of position. I honestly hope we haven't, but can't help feeling that we have.

I'd rather not end on that grim note. As hard-headed, selfish, and individualistic as we Americans tend to be, we're also a very determined and creative bunch that can quickly turn to cooperation under extreme pressure. My hope is that this pressure releases those better angels of our nature."

A fair number of epidemiologists do take the data seriously, and I tend to trust their judgement here because they're the experts and I'm not. That said, I'm not convinced we need to fuss too much over China's data when we have other datasets to look to that we can put more trust in. Hopefully that made sense.

Virginia,fljue79,t1_fljsuis,1585226820.0,"Here's my anecdotal conclusion from the conversations I've had about this with friends and family who have delayed taking this seriously or still don't take it seriously: *they have a very difficult time thinking about possibility.*

That's the broadest way I can describe what I've personally observed. The way that's cashed out in their cognition is that they only seem to grasp the first level impact of the virus. They're simply cognitively blind to the *other possible ways* that the virus can impact the world outside of themselves, therefore, the ways those impacts are part of dynamic systems, including feedback loops. To be even more specific, using their own intellect they only seem to be able to grasp the degree to which the virus may or may not impact them.

In real terms what many of them have done using their own intellect is to notice that the mortality rates being thrown around, even in the worst case, are small numbers, like ""3%"" or ""1%"". The number ""3"" is small. A 3% chance of something is a small chance. When they flip coins or play games, the chances of things happening are much larger than that! Not only that, ""but I'm in my \[20s, 30s, 40s\], and most people in those groups seem to be fine"". The upshot of this mental calculation is, ""what's all the fuss about? I'll be fine, and most of the people I know will be find"". And that's where the thinking stops, literally.

Recognizing how mortality isn't inherent, and how it's a dynamic property affected by multiple levers, just requires more complex thinking that recognizes how different dynamic systems influence each other, and even how effects can cascade in such a way as to create feedback loops. But I actually don't think those things are the main obstacle.

The reason I think the issue is the ability to consider possibility, is that for many of them, once they can be walked through the possibilities they've failed to notice, they're capable of linking things together and can then see how the system as a whole can be affected. So it's not exactly that they're too stupid to sort it out. It seems to be that they just, for whatever reason, can't see past the first level impact -- it really seems to be a kind of cognitive blindness to possibility."
Virginia,fljth2n,t1_fljsh3w,1585226063.0,">Are they literally ‘locked down’ at home?

Yes, as much as possible. The measures studied across these articles range from do nothing, to close schools and other places where people congregate in large numbers, to do that last thing and lock down at home, and so on. The second article specifically studies how much of the population needs to ""lock down"" to make a difference.

The essential recommendation of the first article is this:

>We show that in the UK and US context, suppression will minimally require a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members. This may need to be supplemented by school and university closures...

Though they go on to note *unstudied* but potential negative impacts from school and university closure and they note that their model does not take into account contact tracing (heavily tracing the historical interactions from the prior days and even weeks of people who test positive). Strong testing combined with strong contact tracing seems to have played a large role in South Korea's ability to manage spread of the disease (two things we're not doing yet in the US).

The essential finding from the second is just that you need something like 80-90% compliance with ""lock down"" at home to make a significant difference in the spread of the disease.

>Plus aren’t they roughly about 6 weeks ahead of us?

Yes. They are ahead of us in both time and in terms of the measures they've taken to control spread. We, unfortunately, frittered away our time downplaying the seriousness of the disease and have yet to take the same kinds of serious control measures they did.

This is a clear case where the psychological and social characteristics of a society really matter to the outcome. In China and other Asian countries, populations tend to be far less individualistic, more compliant, and more tolerant of authoritarian control. In the West, and especially in the US, we tend to be very individualistic, don't like being told what to do, and resist authority. In normal times those characteristics can be good for creating relatively free and open society, which is something worth wanting and developing. However, that doesn't mean those characteristics are universally good under all possible conditions. Under a selection pressure like this one, they appear to be liabilities that endanger us all."

In the United States as a whole I expect mortality will be greater than 1%. In some places in the United States it's going to be significantly greater than 1%.

Track your county's social distancing compliance [here](https://www.unacast.com/covid19/social-distancing-scoreboard). Encourage your community to comply."
Virginia,fljopdx,t1_fljo0pk,1585221442.0,"It's true. Please take social distancing guidelines seriously. Don't touch your face and wash your hands often, especially after contact with things that could have been contaminated. For more info, check the CDC page, Johns Hopkins has good resources, so does Harvard and WHO.

Virginia,fljmz3t,t1_fljauxs,1585219483.0,"No, absolutely not 100%. Closer to 1%. But please understand the threat to society is not in the virus' ability to kill individuals. This virus spreads very quickly, and so the number of infected over a relatively short time can grow to a very large number. It's true, most people will end up okay. However, some \~15-20% of those infected will need hospitalization. Hopefully now the problem presents itself. If 100,000 people are infected at one time, then 15,000-20,000 of them may need hospitalization. Virginia has \~19,000 hospital beds. If all of them are taken up by coronavirus patients, and you get in a car accident or have a heart attack, then you're SOL. That's the big problem. The problem is hospitalization, and not just the virus impact on individuals."
Virginia,flhtj2x,t1_flht0e3,1585169216.0,"I haven't seen that. I'll pick through it tonight. If that's true, that'd be absolutely wonderful news for the UK."
Virginia,flhrz5m,t1_flhpl6c,1585168390.0,"I used to have the same opinion, but I've changed my mind lately. Here's why. Even though it's true that the Princess Diamond case skewed older which likely increased fatality rates, other factors relevant to mortality skewed in the other direction  -- e.g. the whole population was tested, quaranteen was very effectively deployed (the population was both easy to control and compliant), and the population was heavily monitored and treated by health care professionals. We have to remember that mortality rates aren't an inherent property of a thing. The way we use cars has some mortality rate attached to it. If we all decided to drive blindfolded for the next year, then the mortality rate attached to how we use cars would go way up.

South Korea had very good visibility of the virus and few new cases in the last several days, which suggests that they've successfully controlled community spread almost entirely for weeks (maybe...we still need to watch this of course). This gives a very small lower bound for non-detection and a high confidence in the remaining numbers while also offering a **very** large population sample. The priority and carefulness of early detection has allowed SK to give some of the best care we're likely to see out of any nation with a substantial case load, making it excellent data to look at for lower bounds under ideal real world circumstances. Last I checked SKs fatality rate was just north of 1% with no significant biases to account for. These ratios are pretty damn close to the Diamond Princess population. I'm pretty confident that *the lower bound under medically ideal real world circumstances is no less than 1%*!

I can't stress enough that both Diamond Princess and SK are as close to ideal situations as we're likely to find. Pretty much everywhere else, and certainly most places in the U.S. are going to suffer from very messy variance in the factors relevant to mortality like lackluster and half-ass social isolation and insufficient medical resources.

tl;dr We can do it! We can control the rate of infection...if 80%+ of the population complies with social distancing measures.

In the yeehaw, cowboy world of the United States where a quarter of the population's yelling ""nobody tramples muh rights and tells me what to do"", and another 25% don't even believe this is real, and some of each just want the stock market to go up at any human cost, we're in for a rude awaking when what's now a statistical tsunami becomes a real one made of hospitalizations and deaths."
Virginia,flhn7ey,t1_flhfy0p,1585165845.0,"I don't know that it's that much. But, fuck it, let's do some shitty math. 9 deaths as I type this. Best case scenario of \~1% fatality rate (see Diamond Princess/South Korea data). Mean time from infection to death is something like 18 days. Infections are roughly doubling every 3 days. In 18 days that's 6 doubling periods. The deaths we have are the product of the infections from the past. 9 deaths is 1% of 900. That puts our super rough, napkin guesstimate of 900 actual infections from the past resulting in the 9 deaths we count today. Now just run 900 through 6 doubling periods and, bing, bang, <cough>, boom, we're probably at something between 50,000 and 60,000 actual infections in the state right now. We'll see deaths come in faster over the next few weeks as they're the product of the much higher actual infection numbers right now. It's like a god damn apocalyptic harvest of death. In any event, this shitty math roughly corresponds with more sophisticated modeling that the current infection numbers in other places in the US (and the US generally) are probably on the order of 10x more than the confirmed positive results. You're welcome. Stay home. Wash your hands."

science,flgcohi,t3_fon0os,1585139015.0,I won't be surprised if decades from now researchers find a statistically significant result relative to heart health among the population who had to go through this virus mess. I know I'm not sleeping as well as I used to.
dataisbeautiful,flf945z,t1_flf8fck,1585100847.0,"No disagreement here. I'm not saying this is an easy or trivial decision to make, and I'm not the one doing the research upon which leaders are drawing inspiration. I'm just reading the research, trying to understand the calculus as far as I can, and trying to follow the advice of the experts. I know there are reasonable disagreements, however there seems to be some consensus that the overall impact to well-being and the economy is worse if we try to go back to normal too early and without the appropriate systems in place to track and contain the virus than if we try to buy time with distancing while working to develop testing and tracking systems. There's no guarantee of the optimal outcome either way, it just seems experts think one strategy is more likely to succeed than the other."

Overreaction isn't always bad. We're the ancestors of overreactors precisely because some kinds of overreaction increase survival (the ones who always ran at the rustling in the bushes even though most of the time it was just a little mouse)."
