dating_advice,flgoyrp,t1_flg95fc,1585147424.0,Yeah for sure. I also enjoy being one of the guys. I like guys and I find its a lot easier to befriend a guy than a girl. And I personally cant think of a time I got out of the friend zone myself. But that's ok because I'd rather keep my friends as my friends. Keep things simple. If I really like I guy I'll try to make it known off the bat but always keep them guessing. Guys dont like to KNOW that you like them lol but I feel like that kinda goes the same both ways there
relationship_advice,flexgdd,t3_fofwfr,1585093504.0,This sounds terribly immature...
dating_advice,flewqht,t1_fld0fc4,1585093076.0,This is sound advice. I am a female but I've had a similar experience in my journey in trying to attract to opposite sex. And I think this also just goes to show that it doesnt matter how you look so much but how you act. Now I'm a pretty good looking girl I would say but it wasnt until recently that Ive been able to actually get guys. I seemed to always be one of the guys. And whenever I liked a guy I would usually either go full avoidance mode where I ignore them and I act way too friendly whenever I do interact or I would put them on a pedestal and I ended up chasing the guy and that almost always turns a guy off. It waskt until I started observing other girls. Girls who have guys wrapped around their finger that I ymcould recognize my own problems and learn new tricks. It's really boosted my game. Flirting comes a lot easier now. I'm not perfect! But its better:)
socialskills,fjas84y,t1_fjarxfv,1583179593.0,Will do. I'll make sure he knows that he cant treat me however he wants
dating_advice,fj7e4ae,t1_fj754bn,1583090301.0,I did on the day of once because I was getting over a serious break up and I thought I liked the guy but I really didnt and the thought of seeing him gave me so much anxiety that I started bawling so yeah I messaged him the day of and told him I wasnt coming...
socialskills,fj6vfzb,t1_fj6v541,1583081023.0,True ok. Well I'll try to just keep it short and sweet next time
socialskills,fj6ufw5,t1_fj6gnar,1583080405.0,"Yeah I can get that but I am also stressed. It's just inappropriate. You should be able to speak without swearing at people like that. It isn't like were doing brain surgery here.

I personally think if you're gonna work in a restaurant you should know how to calm yourself down in stressful situations. When I first started waiting I let the stress get to me really bad. So bad that one night I had a mental breakdown and I had to stop everything I was doing to cry... it was shit. But after that I decided I would never again let myself get so stressed over something so silly. Now if I ever feel stressed I just take a deep breathe and remind myself it's only food. Its just food. It's just one night.

Now I never even get close to that kind of stressed at work. It really isn't that hard. People just need to grow up."

socialskills,fj6tm0g,t1_fj6gnar,1583079892.0,"Oh hes been treating me like shit for weeks. This is just this first time he called me anything like that. Maybe I sound stupid but I think the guy had a thing for me. I liked him too but he has a BIGGER thing for another girl at work and whenever she was around he would totally ignore me so naturally I lost interest in him and I low key think hes pissed at me because I wouldnt keep him on a pedestal even though he clearly only ""liked"" me whenever it was just me. Because ever since I stopped flirting with him this has been the story. I mean I'm not a dude so correct me if I'm wrong on this one. I just fuckin hate all these immature people..."

But I do agree. I domt like the blame game and I don't think it really had much place in the restaurant.

deardiary,fi66ccd,t3_f19svc,1582180560.0,I was literally just looking for a place to post about the guy I'm really into rn and I see this. But this guy is easily the largest guy I've ever gone for. He has resting bitch face and kinda beady eyes and his hair color is kind fucked but God damn I wanna ride his cock. I've never been in this potistion before and it's strange but also refreshing
relationship_advice,fi62mq5,t1_fi621no,1582176994.0,Yeah well if you like her for who she is as a person then you two should still be able to be friends. And yeah it's normal to not REALLY be into anyone when your younger I think. Idk I just know I used to have a lot of little crushes in high school but I didnt ever find a guy I wanted to date until I was like 16-17. It takes a special person to really make you feel that spark and you just dont find special people every day but that's ok. If you did then they wouldnt be very special! Make losing them especially hard too but you'll make it through. You might think youll never find someone like them and you wont. But you can always find someone just as good if not better. You just have to be patient. Good luck :)
relationship_advice,fi622lb,t3_f6o1y9,1582176505.0,If it makes you uncomfortable it makes you uncomfortable. You shouldnt have to put up with that. Despite what he is doing with her he should value you and your feelings and he should want you to feel good being with him. You should probably talk about this with him again. If he doesnt change tho he likely never will.
relationship_advice,fi6168q,t3_f6o1z6,1582175742.0,Yeah sounds like it. And there isn't anything you can really do except just show her what a great guy you are but you cant push it. Maybe its just me but the more a guy pushes the less attractive he is to me. Comes off desperate. You're young. Dont waste your time trying to get this specific girl who is frankly quite out of the way and doesnt want a relationship.

socialskills,fg74ble,t1_fg717r1,1580583679.0,Like I said I told the guy I dont want to date so I'm not sure how much clearer I can be. And I just genuinely don't get feelings for people too easily. I recognize kind actions and words and appreciate them but like there has to be that spark and its just not there. I need to feel like I could trust a serious partner with my feelings. I view my feelings and emotions as more sacred then sex. Sex is fun and it feels good but there isn't much more too it. With a monogamous partner it can feel a little more fulfilling but idk if rather just open up to my girl friends and mess around until a find a guy that really catches my eye. I'm not one to open my heart up very quickly. Just different priorities I guess.
socialskills,fg70kd5,t1_fg6ylld,1580581176.0,Oh yeah I'm not the dating getting attached type. I'm actually FWB with a guitarist from one of the local bands. He also does solo acoustic so that's cool. But like we always have a genuinely good time together and we dont ALWAYS do the dirty lol naw it's all good. If anything he has more feelings for me than I for him. He was getting jealous last night but Ive told him explicitly that I only view him as a friend so.
socialskills,fg6xh56,t1_fg6r8gz,1580579146.0,This made me fr giggle 😆 I'll have to keep that in mind. I just figure with these band guys you might have to kinda put yourself out there a bit to get noticed. And I know you said they're losers but not all of them. A lot of my normal friends are in bands. Like local bands. I live in a small city so it's all pretty buddy buddy. And one of the knot fun things to do around here is go to gigs so you kinda just get to know people after a few shows haha
socialskills,fg6p2ve,t1_fg6b65e,1580573603.0,Oh yeah I know some have their heads up their asses. I go for a lot of band members. I just cant help but be drawn to the influx of masculine energy that these men produce up on stage. It's always super attractive to me. And I've actually scored with a couple guitar players xD but that wasnt due to my amazing flirting abilities by any means. This was just one of the first times in my life where I REALLY put myself out there. I was doing everything in the book. I got close when I talked to him. I asked questions. Complimented him. Smiled. Laughed. Maybe a stray touch on the arm. He was responding well at first but things totally shifted once we went outside :/ but I mean like you said it's his loss. He clearly wasnt interested so best to not dwell on it I guess

socialskills,fg64her,t1_fg64atg,1580553157.0,It's hard for me man ok?

socialskills,fdj6a57,t3_elg2iu,1578459633.0,"I feel the same way. After reading this I think this is definitely part of my problem. I have two friends. One is a long time friend I've had since like 8th grade we've pretty much been best friends since the beginning. I made that friendship during a time in my life where the fear of rejection was far less and intimacy didn't seem so scary.

My other friend I'm honestly kinda amazed about. My other friend is a girl and usually I dont get along super well with other girls but this one is a lot more laid back and I specifically dont feel judged by her. I find a lot of girls make me feel way too judged to be friends with.

But. Like. Anytime I meet someone i feel like i tend to keep my distance and hide my true self away a little because I think once they see who I really am they wont like me and even if they like me at first they will dislike me as they get to know me. I think I just feel like a big old loser a lot of the time."
