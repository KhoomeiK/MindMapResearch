dbtselfhelp,fr0spwq,t1_fr0a3zb,1589805783.0,"I don’t fully lack remorse, since I regret making this post and such. The not feeling it thing is a combination of the autism making me unable to fully comprehend abstract concepts like remorse, and a “survival adaptation” I’ve developed due to being abused for my entire life for things I didn’t know I did wrong. I found that it is a lot easier to stand your ground if you don’t feel like you deserve it. That part is ongoing. I’ve found myself continuing the cycle, is what it is. It’s actually gotten worse since I became sober and started mindfulness meditation (2018) because I am now reliving all of my past trauma daily whenever I do that, and still living it in the current world too. I used to think it was “harm OCD” but apparently if you have OCD you don’t ever act on the urges. They are absolutely not impulsive or reckless. I think twice about everything and fully process it, and do it.

I cannot tell a therapist about the trauma and home life but it is also possible that it’s C-PTSD “rage mode” since it is directly related to the abuse/abusers. I saw a sub about that but I have no idea if it applies to me because I can’t consult a therapist on it."
