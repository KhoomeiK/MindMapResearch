Howard said that in the deal Cadle agreed to give her the money after expenses incurred for publishing book were taken out, which Howard thinks will be very little, like she'll come up with all kinds of expenses. Cadle had to contact sellers and get book taken off shelves. However now people who have copies are trying to sell for 3x the original price of book online. Cadle can publish book under a different name after all plagiarism is taken out, obviously. But I doubt she will given the embarrassment of the whole ordeal, plus trying to find a new publisher and costs."

I'm guessing that after they have exhumed body and see whether or not foul play was involved, like being drugged...if she was and kids are no longer alive..I think they did the same with kids. Gave them something before bed and they didnt wake up."
LoriVallow,fjpyl5j,t3_fene0z,1583563295.0,"I looked him up on YouTube and people are reading his books for clues. And there was an FBI profiler not assigned to case reading them. He said in one of Chad's autobiographies his occupation was grave digger. Doesnt mean anything but ya know kinda creepy. But I also looked up the age of accountability in the Mormon church and its 8 years old. Her son was 7 when he went missing..was there a twisted idea of ""saving"" him from world before things got bad?  I don't know, her daughter is 17 but I wonder if they had her baptized and think they are again ""saving"" them, as in they are no longer alive. If that makes sense. Theres some murdery cultish vibes in all of this. It gets people to do some things out of any rational realm. Or could be that Tylee was a witness to death of stepdad. And then her uncle dies mysteriously. Not wanting any witnesses? Because Tylee was last seen before her brother, who was last seen later in the month.
Also, I think Chad knew well what he was doing was wrong. He seems like a predator. And I think he murdered his wife to be with Lori..and vice versa. Hes a con man. He doesn't care whether people are saved according to the gospel. He is conning people and cashing in. Lori followed like a sheep and did something terrible I think. And they both stood to gain financially. There seems to always be a financial motive as well."
