They couldn't tell me what the heart rate was but did say they saw his/her heart beating. 

Also, if you want a more accurate prediction of your due date, you can use Pregnancy Due Date Calculator from what to expect. I foud this very helpful. They calculate it from the first day of your last period, just like your OB does. 

My nurse also told me every baby develops at the same rate so there is nothing to be alarmed if your baby is smaller than expected; the important thing is there is a heart rate. Hope this brings you some peace of mind."

They have a walk-in service called the living room where you can speak with a therapist that has personal experience with mental illness. They also have drop-in centers where people can go to socialize with others with mental illness (even on holidays) and they even offer all sorts of group Therapys there.

You have legitimate symptoms that are impacting your life and should feel validated not criticized by your psychologist. Keep looking for a better psychologist they are out there.

Next time when you find a psychologist you are interested seeing, ask them if you can meet in person or talk over the phone, before giving you an intake, to see if you like them before you waste your money. During this time I would recomend asking them you can ask them questions. I read an article   that gave me a lot of great questions to ask.

mentalhealth,f8w7vak,t3_e2i0ni,1574885061.0,"I can relate to this alot and feel like I am going through something similar. For me, I am trying to figure out the root problem. I have a tendency to minimize my own feelings and to be anxious about everything happening around me until I blow up about something small and crash into depression. This has caused my boyfriend a lot of stress and I feel tremendously guilty about this. He has been so supportive and makes me want to improve not just for me but for him too. 

People who are dealing with a mental illness unintentionally can negatively effect those who care about them. I think it is important to, when you can, to take a step back and show your appreciation for their support. This can make a world of difference for those special people in your life. 

I encourage you to, if you aren't already, to figure out not just how to control your emotions but what the root cause is. Depression and anxiety always have a root cause and without dealing with what is causing you to feel that way, you will have a difficult time regulating your emotional state.

Writing in a journal can be a helpful coping strategy. It can paint a bigger picture about what is causing you to feel depressed and anxious while simultaneously relieving some stress. You may even find that doing so will help give your mind the space to enjoy your time with your boyfriend and friends and to live in the moment.

Therapy is a difficult step to take but if you truly feel that depression and anxiety is affecting your life, it is important to do so to improve your life. I just started therapy and feel like my therapist has given me a different perspective about everything I am going through. It can be helpful to talk to someone who is not intimately involved in your life. 
Good luck on your journey to recovery!"

1/4Â teaspoonÂ salt

1/3Â cupÂ unsalted butterÂ softened to room temperature

3/4Â cupÂ white sugar

1Â largeÂ eggs

1Â teaspoonÂ vanilla extract

1Â tablespoonÂ red food coloringÂ liquid or gel

1/2Â cupÂ buttermilk**

1 1/2Â teaspoonsÂ distilled vinegar

3/4Â teaspoonÂ baking soda

For the Cream Cheese Frosting

1/2Â cupÂ unsalted butterÂ room temperature

8Â ozÂ cream cheeseÂ room temperature, 8 oz

1Â teaspoonÂ vanilla extract

1/4Â teaspoonÂ salt

3Â cupsÂ powdered sugar

1/4Â cupÂ cornstarchÂ optional

Instructions

Red Velvet Cupcakes

Preheat the oven to 350F degrees. Line a muffin pan with muffin papers.Â 

In a large bowl sift together the cake flour, cocoa and salt. Whisk gently.Â 

In a separate large bowl beat the butter until fluffy (about 2 minutes). Then beat in the sugar until creamy (about 1-2 more minutes).

Beat in the egg and vanilla extract.Â 

In a liquid measuring cup whisk together the buttermilk and red food coloring.

Beat the dry ingredients (flour mixture) into the butter mixture about 1/3 at a time, alternating with about 1/3 of the buttermilk mixture. Turn off the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.Â 

In a small bowl or cup dissolve the baking soda into the vinegar. Quickly beat it into the cupcake batter.

Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin papers, filling each about 2/3 full. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-18 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Allow the cupcakes to cool in the pan for 5-10 minutes, before removing from the pan and continuing to cool on a wire rack.

Cream Cheese Frosting

In a large bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter until fluffy.Â 

Mix in the cream cheese until evenly combined. Then add in the vanilla and salt.

In a separate bowl sift together the powdered sugar and cornstarchÂ (if using).

Beat the powdered sugar into the butter and cream cheese mixture about 1 cup at a time, starting with the mixer on low and turning it up to medium speed as the sugar incorporates.

Frost the cooled cupcakes using a piping bag and tip (I used a 1M) or a knife.Â "
