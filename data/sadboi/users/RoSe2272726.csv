It hurts and it taught me to not be proud of myself when I do accomplish something, because it won’t ever be good enough for my parents. 

Don’t give up on yourself, you are worth having faith in to succeed. Your parents don’t know everything and are fools to give up on someone who hasn’t even reached their full potential yet. Reward yourself for the things you do accomplish even if you are the only one. You’re going to do great :)"

When I decided to watch what I eat my stepmom would always talk shit about me to my father because I hardly ate her unhealthy dinners but would eat all the salad. I think people get so upset by this because they too want to have self control but they don’t because of the stigma to being more healthy. 

Don’t make yourself suffer because of others. Eat what you want because it’s YOUR body, not theirs. But when you do go out to eat you can “cheat” every once in a while. A couple of bad meals a month won’t take away all of your progress."
relationships,fdr6amp,t3_emuo7k,1578680118.0,"This happens to me every single time I’m in a relationship. Although, for me when the guy stops reaching out and I get anxious he usually ends up leaving me. But that’s probably just because we are young and guys my age aren’t emotionally mature yet. 

From these experiences of extreme anxiety I found that my abandonment issues from my parents directly effect my romantic relationships. Since my parents didn’t give me emotional care the way I needed growing up I now get super anxious if my needs aren’t being met in a romantic relationship and I assume they will leave like my parents did. 

I’m not saying this is what’s going on with you, just something to think about. I would suggest sitting down with your partner and coming to a middle ground where he can let you know he cares on a more regular basis but is within reason with his schedule. You might even want to talk to a therapist about this to see if there is some underlying issue. Best of luck to you! :)"

Going through that shit fucking sucked and made me want to kill myself, but it made other life challenges way easier to deal with since I’ve already been through so much. You are also likely to be empathetic to others who are in pain since you have also experienced it. Which means that the world is lucky to have someone like you.
