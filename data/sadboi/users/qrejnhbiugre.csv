Also, those kids on facebook, I hate them for ruining my life. I know I'll get some hate, but I don't hate them personally, just because mom compares me with them .

y'know, those kids are doing better because they got so much time and support. Something you lack. Maybe she's a narcissist, that may answer your question.

It's good to vent and express yourself.

Also about your mom? she needs to chill."

I am in Hong Kong, where beating IS illegal, but cops don't do anything. Y'know, I don't really want to exist. But anyway, I feel like I sugar coat everything to prevent people saying I'm overreacting. And yeah, teachers and others do that.

Thanks for your nice words. It's been a long time since I started trusting myself. All I've heard was ' look at it from your parents view' or ' It not that hard!! Huh? You made a mistake, you should blame yourself' Thank you.

My former teachers blamed me also. My parents act like 2 separate beings. 1 moment they are all nice and friendly..... 

Anyway, what happened at the end was:

Parents : Do you want us to control you??!! ( They meant discipline, but to me it was that )

Me : No No No I Know what to do I-

Parents : (Looking at each other ) Lets just give up, if she wants to become homeless, it's fine with us..

Parents :( sees people outside looking at them )

Parents : PANIC"
