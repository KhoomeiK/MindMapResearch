AskWomenOver30,fq5qgmj,t3_ggv44o,1589114584.0,"I definitely think this period of lockdown has been one of forced reflection. So many distractions and time spent commuting etc is gone, and also the positive things that make life worthwhile have been taken away, leaving just boredom at best, and stressful work at worst, with none of my usual coping mechanisms or distractions. So having just a lot of time to think on the whole point of life at all. Especially if you’re not religious (I’m an atheist).

It’s made me think a lot about what is really important in life- joy, family, friends, adventure, novelty, pleasure, love, little physical endorphin boosts like a nice view, nice smells, music.

It’s made me want to streamline my life to focus on those."

AskWomenOver30,fhxkayl,t3_f587ur,1581956304.0,"I admire you trying to keep an open mind, but for me, there are two main issues here. 1) having shared values and ideology, or at least aligned values, is really important for longer term relationships. You don’t need to be exactly the same in every way to your partner, but your underlying values have to fit together, and any differences have to be communicated about healthily. What if you have kids? How will you agree to raise them? How will you make big life decisions if your fundamental building blocks for life clash? Not only do you have opposing views, he can’t properly debate, be respectful or admit when he may be wrong. 2) I’m trying to keep my own (very liberal) politics aside, but some of the people he looks up to are, to put in lightly, disrespectful and worrying.

I don’t really have an answer other than I try not to think about it too much, or I think about how many skills and tough experiences I’ve had to go through that they haven’t. I think wow I’ve had to cope with X and Y and remind myself I’m strong, adaptable, independent and really capable because I’ve had to be. 

It still stings though and the sense of injustice hugely gets to me.

I find this helps me stop blaming myself for ‘being single’ or whatever else I’ve decided I’m doing wrong.

I’m lucky in some ways that my job is well paid-ish, as in I work in the public sector but get a graduate salary, travel card included and very good pension benefits, but that’s because no one wants to do my job. I actually want to leave my current profession but feel like I can’t due to finances. 

I work VERY hard to save. I save over a 1/3 of my salary every month, I live in a house share, I don’t buy expensive things. I put money in a savings account with good interest, I also have a LISA (don’t know if these exist out of UK but it’s a mortgage saving account where the government tops up 20%). I don’t spend lots of money on things like clothes or drinks on nights out. I’m quite frugal and the thought of wasting money causes me huge panic. 

I also try to remember that whatever happens, I would be OK. Absolute worst case scenario, I could stay on friends sofas, there are state benefits. Obviously I don’t want to get to that state and don’t think I would, but I reassure myself that I’m never truly truly alone or at risk of real homelessness."

Except I am not, and I can't magic that into existence, it probably doesn't exist, as you say. So it truly is misery inducing. I just feel like I've failed somehow in not achieving it when it seems others have. 

Thanks for the prompts to be kind to myself, I'm very very hard on myself normally, and have caught my inner voice being so critical and harsh to myself today.

I hate the ‘suck it up’ culture. It’s so damaging and means they can’t keep good staff anyway. And just feels so toxic. How can we support people without supportive teams around us? It’s so ingrained in my workplace though. 

Thanks for the ideas. I always thought EDMR was more for like a one-off traumatic event, whereas I feel like I have a build up of so many things mashed together. I have wondered sometimes if some kind of group would be a good idea, I’ll look those near me up.

I think there are some online support groups on social media I might look into, for some candid ranting and support.

Talk space is really good idea thanks. I know I need to speak to someone but finding the right therapist takes time (and money), and something I can just write to and rant might help
