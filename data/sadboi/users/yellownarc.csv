depression,f9sm1u3,t3_e6k4l8,1575595017.0,I mean a fresh start sounds nice. You're going to miss your old life probably. I've thought about running away to or suicide by a certain age but I don't see myself pulling thru with it. I have thought about other more violent acts to commit before a certain amount of years go by though. At that time I vowed to do certain things but I was at a very low point in my life at that time. Things are better now tho.
