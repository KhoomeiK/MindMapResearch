HuntingGrounds,fr2d2q0,t3_gm5iu7,1589835203.0,"I go in head first with berserker and combistick!

Just kidding.

I play the long game, I stalk my prey I usually find them within the first couple minutes, I then start harassing with my bow.

If the fireteam is good at tracking me I don’t have time to aim with the bow, that means I start using the plasma caster as I can aim quicker take a shot and move again.

I’ll rinse and repeat this and every now and then jump in for some stealthy melees and get out before they even know what hit them, my strategy is to wear them down and have them shitting their pants not knowing where the next attack is coming from.

I try keep awareness of pig locations so that I can heal up using that and save time and the health packs for late game.

These tactics usually make teams scared so some dudes end up running and forgetting the team so I sweep In and take them out.

Teams usually look up constantly at the trees so I make sure to use the ground as much as possible too it keeps them guessing.

Ranged is my favourite I love the stealth approach and hearing the fireteam freak out. 

If the fireteam lasts long enough to exfil, then I chase them to the exfil location and shoot with my plasma caster as I chase to wear them down for the show down if there is more than one left so I can finally jump in with slam then finish off with combistick or wrist blades. Though I much rather the non forced combat situation where I can stalk and harass tons of fun."
