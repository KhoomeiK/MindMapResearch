apexlegends,fr436g9,t1_fr42vvl,1589874242.0,thanks
apexlegends,fr435xy,t1_fr42r18,1589874229.0,"oh, okay, thanks"
apexlegends,fr07fhs,t1_fqy7aww,1589786055.0,"I would disagree, I dont think he is that less viable than Loba or Wraith. I think he was nerfed just to prevent non stop grappling and for balance."
apexlegends,fquiq2f,t1_fqq5p2l,1589659594.0,">raith cooldown is 35 seconds and nobody thinks sheâ€™s unviable, Loba is 30 seconds. It balances out the mobility characters. As a pathfinder Main this is completely fine, just stops the shit players from grappling 4 times in a minute to get away

I agree. If they have to lower it I woulds say 25 or 30sec is the best, but 35 sec just stop people from using it all the time. Maybe players just need to get used to it."
memes,fquhj1d,t3_gkxdbf,1589659066.0,What can we even do about people like that at this point?
apexlegends,fqsybxd,t1_fqrzqq8,1589623395.0,"His abilities are really strong in the late game. Knowing where the next zone will be and easily getting to a better position is very good. I think he is still very usable. Sure 35 sec is long, but now Path cant just grapple all the time. I agree 35 is a little bit to long so maybe 30 or 25 sec would be enough. There are some great comments on this post, I suggest that you read them because they explain better and you will see what other people think and other opinions. I think both sides make a very good point why the nerf is bad and why is it good."
memes,fqqij4c,t3_gkb1e9,1589566119.0,Thanks.
apexlegends,fqpaa6l,t1_fqpa57p,1589540526.0,"Very good point, I agree."
apexlegends,fqp9cvj,t1_fqp8gny,1589539645.0,"I agree. A lot of people play him for his mobility so I think 35 sec is a little bit too much so maybe 25 or 30 sec would be fine, but you make some very good points. His passive and ultimate are still very good. Sure you cant grapple as much now and you cant escape a fight that easily, but no other legend can do that (except Wraith)."
apexlegends,fqotvq4,t1_fqndnrq,1589524711.0,"I think 20 is not enough, but it is close. People say either 20, 25 or 25, 30, so 25 would be the best. I hope they try it and see what works the best for everyone."
apexlegends,fqotmjg,t1_fqn3mxq,1589524493.0,"I agree. 20 is close, but I still think its not enough, so 25 or 30 would be balanced imo. I hope they just try it and see what works the best for everyone."
apexlegends,fqmz04i,t1_fqmyq6l,1589485892.0,Im just happy they tried something and I hope that now they will see that its not the best and that Path gets a buff.
ApexConsole,fqmydyi,t3_gjphny,1589485599.0,"I noticed that on ps4. I wasnt going to buy new headphones, but still thank you."
apexlegends,fqmy3g2,t1_fqmxmb1,1589485458.0,"Yeah, same with my friend. I dont think he even tried Path, but he switched to Mirage. 35 sec is alittle bit to long so I think 25 or 30 is the best. I also think people are forgeting about his passive and ultimate which are pretty strong, but I think people are mostly playing him for his tactical. I agree, Path will probably get buffed and all will be well."
apexlegends,fqmxetw,t1_fqmwzpc,1589485133.0,"I think he will get buffed. I also think 35 sec is to much, so I would say 25 or 30 sec is the best."
apexlegends,fqmuz0w,t1_fqmuotq,1589483964.0,The thing is they need to balance all three abilities. I think 25 sec and maybe shorter zipline would be balanced.
apexlegends,fqmui9p,t1_fqmucsd,1589483743.0,I think 25 or 30 is the best.
apexlegends,fqmudrz,t1_fqmuajq,1589483685.0,"Yup, I agree"

mentalhealth,fqcwe6f,t3_ghrmqw,1589271220.0,"Me neither. I dont have school over Zoom, teachers upload what we have to do on some website and we do it and I like how it works. We had Zoom class twice and I dont like it because I feel uncomfortable.
Im going back to school in two weeks. It will be only for three weeks but I still dont want to go. I got used to quarantine and for me its not that bad, I mostly sleep and eat. We have to go to school just because. I dont know there is no point. Im not woried that much because of school, I dont want my basketball practices to start back because I dont like it, also some ither stuff. Im more of an introvert so I kinda like quarantine. At first I didnt because everybody was at home, but my sister and my dad go to work now, so Im more alone and its all good."

apexlegends,fq56y3e,t1_fq56v2w,1589094540.0,I hope its just a buff that makes his gas different so his teammates can see which one is from their team and which from another Caustic.
apexlegends,fq564l3,t1_fq5617q,1589093746.0,"Yeah I know, probably not, but Mirage will get a buff and I think its high chance Octane gets one too."
