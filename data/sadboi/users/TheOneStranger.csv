BipolarReddit,fq8yv17,t3_gh98xq,1589179740.0,"It's a lil different for everyone. Lithium seems to give me a ""ceiling"" if that makes sense. But i still experience highs and lows, and they can still be scary, meds are just  half of it. I still have to do some work in terms of keeping a somewhat healthy schedule, diet etc."
BipolarReddit,fq8ygsz,t3_ghdv6c,1589179366.0,"22, no previous experience with psychiatry. Had a delusional manic episode that lasted about a month before intervention, once I was inpatient they were able to diagnose me pretty quickly due to my ""traditional"" symptoms.

A friend of mine who is Bipolar 2 was diagnosed with depression at 14. Later got changed to bipolar 2 when he was about 16."
bipolar,fq8y9d8,t3_ghi0mo,1589179176.0,"It's been happening to me too, my guess is that it has to do with quarantine. I was actually doing better, before the lockdown(in nyc) in terms of having a job and stuff, so I guess this upheaval of sorts has me a little chaotic emotionally. But like you it is transient."

bipolar,fq861gs,t3_ghcakj,1589159222.0,"I was on an antidepressant(lexapro) and lithium. I've been off lexapro for two years now. Honestly, didn't make any difference. Good or Bad. Luckily, there werent any side effect either. Another one of my friends (Bipolar 2) took wellbutrin and it made his suicidal ideation way worse. 

Not anti antidepressant by any means, these are just the two first hand accounts I have."
bipolar,fq85gmp,t3_ghbkb6,1589158884.0,"Sometimes my friends will jokingly say ""I don't understand you."" and i always reply ""neither do I""."
bipolar,fq859cb,t3_gh03tr,1589158767.0,During my first manic episode (straight up psychotic and delusional) and my acute episode last year it alway's felt like I was doing what I was meant to do. Like with a divine purpose almost.

BipolarReddit,fprhc57,t3_gewz1c,1588854149.0,"If you're into soundtracks, The Disco Elysium soundtrack is really nice. I like listening to the Whirling in Rags Hotel Theme(Day). Its very soothing, not depressing but not saccharine either. Oh and videogames tend to help me not feel alone. Not perfect, but tends to be a good distraction."
BipolarReddit,fprgm4y,t1_fprf7vo,1588853600.0,"It's not really in their world to think about it you know? Like, my friends have stuck with me through thick and thin, but I know they just view me as having an ""unfortunate"" brain. But, on the brightside, I got ppl on reddit like you who understand! 

But, with that said, sometimes that lack of understanding feels malicious, even if its not meant to be. Like they just wanna get back to the ""normal"" side of the experience. Makes sense i suppose, my experiences with the lens of bipolar, prolly doesn't hold true for them."
MortalKombat,fpqvo40,t1_fpofoqg,1588833617.0,"the whole reason i get the games at launch is because i like to keep my skills from rusting. but ur right, if buying at launch(i like u also got premium) means paying over 100 bucks, why would I do that. They clearly want us to wait until the hype dies and buy it at a cheaper price. But hey, while we complain, im sure a bunch of ppl have already pre ordered lol"

I felt like the biggest piece of shit, its really disturbing seeing a 10 year old go through a panic attack. Live and learn right!
