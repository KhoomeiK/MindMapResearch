I think this applies to people in general. I'll be the first to admit that in a situation like this, my brain automatically tries to relate it to something in my life (for myself, not anyone else), but it comes across as me being self-centered instead of caring.

>While Antifa groups are most famous for sometimes-violent protests against right-wing groups, the Richmond-based Antifa Seven Hills is joining 2nd Amendment supporters in support of gun rights.

>“I think it’s been pretty important for us to focus on the fact that gun control in America has a legacy of racist enforcement,” Seven Hills spokesperson James told Vice, requesting that his last name be withheld from publication. “Like taking guns away from black people, because black people were perceived as a threat to property and the sanctity of the state.”

We have known the left planned on marching with the right for a few days now. This shouldn't be a surprise, and it really isn't up for debate at this point. The only unknown now is whether both sides actually follow through on that."

depression,fcuo9t6,t1_fcu4mc6,1577985205.0,"There are sacrifices that need to be made, but it doesn't necessarily mean working yourself to death.

The path me and my wife chose was cutting our expenses. The main way we did this was to go completely debt-free. If you can get rid of a car payment, that's several hundred extra dollars per month that you can put elsewhere. For us, that elsewhere is our mortgage.

We are hoping to pay our mortgage off within the next 5 years. Once we get that done, our monthly expenditure will be around $1,000. Theoretically, we should be able to live quite comfortably on $12k per year at that point. 

Yes, it means sacrifice, but it didn't mean we had to work more. There are a bunch of solutions to the problem; you just looked at one of them. r/leanfire more accurately describes our solution (it's been a while since I was on those subs, sorry for missing that the first time)."

depression,f9qp06a,t1_f9p8y2r,1575564723.0,"I'm 23 and [this has been my life](https://imgur.com/a/TSGtmCk) for about 6 months now. It's nice for a day or two, but it becomes a burden pretty quickly. 

I don't consider myself addicted, but I also can't really function well without it. If I don't smoke, I'm having migraines, acid reflux attacks, diarrhea from IBS and my depression and anxiety can spiral out of control pretty quickly.

I really enjoyed my first month. My life was smoking weed, playing video games, going on hikes, and doing whatever I wanted to. At this point, I want to spend time sober. I want to be able to spontaneously go to the grocery store at 2 in the afternoon or not be paranoid because I need to register my vehicle, but I'm clearly high at the DMV.

I am stuck with it for the time being though. I've been focusing on improving my programming skills so that I can (hopefully) start doing some freelancing work within the next few months, but I'm not sure.

The good news is that my doctor literally just called me with some positive results for once. Hopefully I can get treated soon and go back to smoking once or twice a week."

I mainly smoke to combat migraines and to slow down my IBS-D and hopefully get an appetite. Sometimes, like this morning, I smoke because of anxiety and depression that compounds until I smoke myself silly.

I'm not saying there isn't any pleasure to be had from it, but it is a burden. I can't drive myself most of the time and I can't hold down a job due to my medical issues. Any appointment has to be done before 11 AM, otherwise I cannot drive myself there."

depression,f9g6xup,t1_f9fhtcu,1575294410.0,"Eczema was the first to be officially diagnosed last year. Then I was diagnosed with GERD, but nothing has been done to take care of that yet. I believe I also have IBS, but I haven't been diagnosed by a professional yet. 

With those things come depression and anxiety that get pretty bad sometimes. 

When I was a kid and complained about not feeling well (which was most mornings, as is now), my parents convinced me that I was just scared of school; nobody can be sick that much. After complaining about my nausea and abdominal pain that lasts until I defecate, my doctor told me it's normal to feel weird before you poop (as if a grown-ass man doesn't know what a poop feels like).

Long story short, I'm not completely sure, as nobody has really tried to help me, but I think it's a combination of eczema, GERD, IBS, depressions and anxiety."

Don't worry about what they think, even if they are family. Compare yourself to nobody but yourself and try to make improvements every month. As long as you are getting better, everyone else can go fuck themselves.

That's my attitude anyways."

I have them when I walk 8 miles a day for months on end, and I have them when I don't work out for months on end. The only respite for me is drugs, and that will likely never change.

There is no ""moving out of Alaska"", only making it better. Maybe you have to just get a heater, buy warmer clothes, and stockpile a bunch of media. For some, drugs are neccessary, at least for a time, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.
