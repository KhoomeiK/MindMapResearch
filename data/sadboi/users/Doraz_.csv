A reddit comment can't do much tho.

you gotta be strong enough to put what you know in doubt, confirm it or correct it by yourself, and grow stronger. 
that helped me a lot.

In this specific case, you are complaining of a ""injustice"" that you can see and judge wheter to take the risk (loan) while in europe you are much less free in your choices, despite saying (it's free, it's cheaper!) governaments try to take every penny in all rest of life, most people end being trapped in a cycle of relative poverty ... 

with people like most of the commenters saying "" yeah, that's not fair"" "" they should die"" ""ecc."" while doing nothing to improve their state, even paying them to keep doing it (again, in europe THAT is by design, non economic crisis, you can thank IVA and debt for that).

TL;DR
In USA you are owner of your own destiny (lol, sounds so cheesy) and can reward good behaviour (in this case, in school choice and book companies).
