My mom would blame my ED, and say I didn’t develop because of it :l However, I don’t think that’s true at all, since I see other women have a nice, curved shape after they recover.

The good news is, I’m pretty social and comfortable in my skin now. I’ve done a lot of exploring with myself, and now I just have this addiction awkwardly stuck to me. Everything in my life won’t all of a sudden “fall into place” once I get sober. I’m very blessed to say, it’s already all together. Quitting every drug will just be icing on the top, and I guess I’m nervous I’ll miss this like I did when I was fully sober. I would romance my using days, and now I’m here in them. But I’m 28, it’s almost time to pack up my shit. I want to start a family by six or seven years, and that’s almost how much time I been fuckin with kratom, so I know that will be here in a blink of the eye. 

Thank you for talking to me again!"
quittingkratom,fl1xsze,t1_fl1unio,1584738552.0,"Lol I knew you would say that, because I have the mind of every twelve stepper now, which is a blessing and a curse. I feel like I was brain washed to have freedom of thought. My favorite sticker I got from someone at a meeting was “Help! I been thinking too much.” Like wtf, this shit reminds me of church, when they don’t want you to question any sort of independent thinking and to discount our way of thinking since we are addicts/alcoholics. But, I totally get it, because with my thinking, this is how I ended up with a 3.5 year addiction with Kratom abuse. Going back to AA and quitting all substances would be the easier, softer way for my own well-being IMO lol. Not easy to do, of coarse, but me trying to figure out a different way has been burning my ass— mentally, physically, and financially. I’m constantly  battling with one side of me that says I’m shortening my progress and honesty in myself by trying to do things “my way,” and then other times thinking I should do what I want if I’m not happy in full sobriety, especially while I’m young; and that I’m brave to try and make sure there is no other way instead of mindlessly just listening to a bunch of people. But I remembered I valued what people said in the rooms, because they were exactly like me. 

I hung with people in recovery during the time, even found a meeting with young people, but I had difficulty making actual friends. I also joined a new club at my school for people in recovery, and won “recovery advocate of the year.” However, every now and then I got tempted to go out, especially since my apt were next to the hottest street in town for bars. I had actual friends who weren’t in recovery, and I clicked with them so much more than the people i knew in AA. I had a sponsor, but just didn’t feel connected to her or the other girls in my group. I got upset too that I couldn’t find a bf (I know, so lame but I was 22/23) that understood my sobriety. I had a codependent friendship with a girl from my school recovery group (not AA), that was in the group from her recovery group from heroin addiction. She still drank, and said alcohol was never her issue, and she can drink just fine. I got tempted, especially since I never been to a bar at the time, and convinced myself maybe I had a drinking problem just because of all the drugs I was abusing, and the fact that I was in an abusive relationship back then. 

I should have got a new sponsor. Should have not went to Vegas with that friend (that’s where I first relapsed). Should have got therapy, because even when I relapsed and met more guys to date, there were so many issues I realized I had, and just started working on this year. I didn’t put my recovery first, to bend back for friends and people I dated. I think my subconscious did that on purpose, because it wanted me to relapse. 

Now I feel stuck. Not ready to give up all vices. My old and favorite sponsor told me that I’m lucky I got back to the rooms three years ago, because a lot of people never make it back. I rolled my eyes at that, but now I see what she means... it gets more and more difficult to get sober the more I relapse. I just see this as a chapter in my life; I don’t feel hopeless, and full sobriety might be the only conclusion for me. obviously with this long post, I do a lot of thinking about my choices. Yeah, my ideas might be bullshit and flop, but I have to try it because I will always question if it all could have worked out in the end. Sorry for the long rant, just wanted to share with you my thoughts since I get to talk to someone in the program online about my perceptions and struggles."
quittingkratom,fl1tvld,t1_fkz7tfk,1584736195.0,"Ughs lol. I dislike that advise 😂 I been in and out of AA for eight years. I don’t like doing the step work over and over. It doesn’t even make me have that awesome, magical moments I felt when I did the step work the first time. I get really bored hearing the same slogans over and over again, or just to listen to how God is so great for the things he does for the people in the rooms. Just very typical when you been going there for a while, but I never get tired of speaker meetings. 

I was completely sober for 2.5 years. I got bored after the second year, and was finding myself depressed and isolated from friends, when I was even hanging out with them. That caused resentment that I can’t drink and be more social (I’m very shy) like any other 23 year old. So I relapsed for like a year. People always can’t deal with my drunk ass, so I got pressured to go back to AA. That’s when I started taking kratom behind everyone’s back. I didn’t want to be sober, but I didn’t want to drink or use illegal drugs, of course. 

Friends in AA? Nope. I’ve made several friends who were closer to my age, but ALL of them went back out, except one. I’ve known my home group for eight years, so going to their meeting is like a family reunion, but I see them more as like “parents” than friends. I still want to get back into the program eventually, but I don’t want to do the steps for the fourth time. No one in my family cares about the amends after the first time. The second time was weird because I was just redoing my steps because I got a new sponsor, so everyone thought I relapsed when I didn’t. Third time was weird because most people didn’t even know I relapsed, and my mom thinks me going to meetings is a “bad” sign that I’m using lol, even though I told her several times it means the opposite. My dad is an introvert too, and he has never had the guts to even try the amends... He bails out of the program every time he gets to the 8th step. 

Sometimes AA or NA just doesn’t fit some people, but it’s a great resource for free support. However, I wish I could find something where they don’t force me to do certain things like the steps, calling my sponsor and making sure she approves everything in my life. I just want to be with people who are like-minded and want to live a more sober life. I only want to continue smoking CBD and drinking kava, every now and then, to get my itch. I only have one life and I don’t want to live it without no substances at all, so I guess I have a more harm reduction approach. But fuck any other substances, I don’t want to ever drink and resort back to illegal drugs. I also have very bad ADHD, but I know Kratom abuse just fucked with it so much more. I’m sure my symptoms would be less if I cleared my body completely, which is my new goal now. Just to see how it is again."

AstralProjection,fknnzm4,t1_fknjz6a,1584370191.0,"I used to abuse MDMA really bad when I was younger. The most pills I’ve ever took in one night was 16, but on average, usually 8-10. I would take them one by one through out the night, but usually by my 5th pill, I would start seeing things, or accidentally think I’m doing something I did earlier that day, like ordering something at a drive thru or being at work all of a sudden, and needing to process a rerun on the machine at work lol. I would literally blabber my response to the illusion, thinking it actually was happening, and snap back to reality. The people I would see were usually my friends and family, not strangers like yours lol (from what I remember). 

In my case on MDMA, I don’t believe this was astral projection tho lol, just my brain in overdrive and forgetting where I was, and decided to replay an earlier event. Maybe some of my pills had ketamine in them or something, I will never know. The illusions on MDMA never scared me either, since you know— you’re so euphoric from the mdma lol. That’s why I gained the balls to smoke salvia on it. Salvia completely ruined my roll that night though lol I was so traumatized by that. I felt like my mind got “raped.” 

And btw, glad to say that I haven’t touched MDMA in 9 years!! Very blessed I was able to escape that addiction, I always swore to myself (especially while I was rolling) that I would never quit, and rather die early than never roll again. Don’t feel that way AT ALL today :)"

I believe I had an astral travel (sorry if I don’t know how to say it right, first time looking on here lol) through the drugs I took. It was the worst, but most intense, and experience I’ve ever had in my life. 

To wrap up things short, I awake to a state of having no body, no me, no control over what I was seeing. I didn’t even remember I took the drugs, until a few minutes into the trip, but when I first woke up, I felt like it’s been years, and I just woke up to a new existence. I met many people on it, who were upset I was not enjoying the trip, so I tried to play along with it, while eternally freaking out lol. At one point, I felt a village on my back, and I was like this flat land for people. It got so intense, I was this sky/world, but then I would feel more “sober” to realize the village was mounted on to my back. I kept trying to flip myself, to get back to a normal body, and when I turned, people screamed in pain, as I realized I was squishing them as I did that. Gravity wasn’t a thing, I felt like I was flipping over and over by force. The scariest part was when I had moments of my body back, and started to remember the life I once had, only to be pulled back into some random dimension. I kept having a voice tell me that none of my life was real, the people in it weren’t real. I had one good moment, I had the most greatest thought to return to humanity, but it vanished into sparkles right in front of me..."

I only been to one haunted house, and never again lmao. But I can watch scary movies, and I like to watch them to distract myself when I’m going through something hard in my life lol. Funny thing, a lot of McKamey’s contestants did the tour in “hard” places, so a lot of them wanted something intense to distract their self from too. 

But the real horror is when you are given mental, physical, or verbal abuse from someone you thought that loved you. Real horror, is being kidnapped and sex trafficked. Real horror, is being robbed at gun point. I think Russ knew all of this and took some of all that and tried to put it into his haunt. I’ll admit, I don’t get why people would even go to his haunt in the first place. I already been through my own shit without signing a waiver for it... lol

Your right, there is a different between “scary” and “horror.”"
Onision,fkivhnz,t3_fiks7u,1584229615.0,"My whole point in mentioning Eugenia and Russ, is that they both have toxic personalities. Very different on the type, but I don’t think it’s healthy for either of them to get a platform to get the “OK” stamp from society, when in the end, it’s making them sicker people. It’s not fair to them or their audience. 

I don’t think Eugenia should be shamed. She did not cause any abuse like Russ has to viewers and family. I just feel like she’s not going to recover with endless fans telling her she’s okay. Loosing an eating disorder feels like loosing yourself. I been through it, and it comes back in waves. Which is why I never watch her videos. I’ve only seen the Shane Dawson one, and the girl just doesn’t seem very interesting to me. I’m not being mean, she’s beautiful and has a sweet personality, and I love her outfits and room. But she seemed kinda off— I don’t know, like childish? Not very much substance, which I’m sure she wanted to portray, so she could avoid taking about her treatment. But you know who loves people for their beauty and cool stuff they have: Adolescents."
Onision,fkiuwhx,t1_fkith0h,1584229215.0,"I get it man, I’m feeling “Reddit out” today myself. 

Do you have any evidence on this though? I’m not trying to do that internet bullshit battle thing everyone is all about, but I’ve done a lot of research into this and would love to read where you got this information with, because I like to know the WHOLE story. I just find it hard to believe that all these people, including ex-actors, would make that shit up. I do believe it was built-up, but the focus is the whole hoax of the thing. His daughter was the only one who shared that she thinks people were mind tricked to certain things, since he blindfolds them. She hasn’t been in contact with him for a decade. He was emotionally abusive to her as a child. The ex wife doesn’t know much about the abuse in the tours, and I think it’s safe to say, she shouldn’t say she did, to protect herself."

That was confirmed by his ex wife and actors in the tours lol."
Onision,fkiq8tw,t1_fkipai6,1584226045.0,"Lmao Fear Factor with amazing Joe Rogan as a host? I’m 28, I watched Fear Factor lol. From what I remember, I believe they had three stages, one always included eating something disgusting, balancing from very high heights, and doing something with being submerged into water and holding your breathe. They knew what they were getting into and there was an actual cash prize. 

Russ’ tour might be Fear Factor influenced now— but when it was in San Diego, it got very violent. Actors were just punching the shit out then senseless, while Russ would verbally humiliate them. Imagine if Joe Rogan did that shit, America would finally reach its top insanity if that was broadcasted on Fox. You haven’t done your research. Look on YouTube— good recommendation: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NZCCWDGBSGQ

This lady’s story is so sad. There are many I’ve looked into after hearing Surviving Life’s McKamey serious that YouTube recommended. This man is not to be trusted and he’s not a good person at all, that’s all I’m saying... I think it’s dangerous he has a platform because there is misinformed people like you, and I don’t want some people with your mindset falling for this guy and going on a “tour” with him."
DojaCatFans,fki0igp,t1_fkhjuvv,1584209452.0,"Yea, I admit, she spiked up the sex appeal in her Instagram posts and in her second album. 

She has been always kinky, but I felt like it went into overdrive the last year lol, and it’s getting all the thirsty people (which is most of the population lol) their attention. That naked outfit is just beautiful on her, but in my opinion, too much man lol. She is in the rap genre tho (which I feel like she’s more pop), so you know the expectations for any woman who makes it in the rap genre... She has a beautiful face and I love the cute, pink style. The anime tits bouncing in moooo were hilarious, that’s the Doja I like, and when I decided this girl is sexy and funny. In the future, I’m sure the music videos will focus on her body, as it sure sells. But she always does it in such style! I love the Juicy music video, the cherry and watermelon outfit was adorable."
Onision,fkhyaeo,t3_fiks7u,1584208245.0,"Don’t forget, Eugina Cooney and Russ McKamey. 

Russ, eh— maybe he shouldn’t be taken down yet, but at one point, his haunt was a hoax, and it hurt people, so I think it’s dangerous for him to have a platform because he’s not a man of his word. Some young adults might get tricked, and he doesn’t do violent tours anymore (but I wouldn’t hold your breathe- I’m sure he’s just on a “break” since he changes up his tours every so often), but the man is just a con artist in general. Someone was charged for his tour, when he claimed he only took dog food for charge, and he once lied and said a winner who could make it through the tour would get 20 K, when he never had that money. Even if you made it, he wouldn’t say so, and claim he needed to stop the tour because it was “too late.” 

Eugina goes without explaining. I heard she is nominated for Youtuber of the year too. Oh... YouTube lol."

Onision,fkbsy1i,t3_fgigdy,1584039258.0,"Greg probably banned her from going on the internet so he can “handle” it, while also blaming Kai for all this, even if Onision was the one who told him to meet with the girls."

Onision,fkbrxxt,t1_fka3h4k,1584038707.0,"Well, he just says so much shit in such a short amount of time, with his exhausting rambles. I would imagine that’s a tactic he uses to get you confused, so you aren’t sure enough on what to call him out on in discussions. He goes back and fourth on certain ideas/claims, over and over. It’s like he has a video on some “facts,” he believes and why, then another video of him expressing the complete opposite of what he explained in the other video. It’s like he wants to make sure he gets both sides of the stories lol. 

But with the Sarah thing, he just really tries to stretch every version he could think of, that he feels like would make him look “good.” It’s funny how he explains to us how you know X person is lying, and then he clearly does what he explained to us, as being untrustworthy. You can tell right there, he doesn’t think he is like everyone else; he feels exceptional."
Onision,fk4xc80,t3_fgb6co,1583869412.0,"I watched Edwin’s long-ass mirror of part 1 lol. The cliffhanger was actually when Keemstar told Greg that Sarah was on the line (or something like that), and that she had a few questions to ask Greg. I was like “ohhh shittt,” lol and it was so satisfying to hear the panic in Greg’s voice, as he started to act like it was “weird” he would have to talk to her lol. I would love to see the opportunity for Greg, Kai, and all Greg’s survivors in the same chat to have a “little” discussion. They both would be sweating so hard lol. I hope Greg talks to Sarah, but I highly doubt that will happen, since I think Keemstar is just trying to make the whole thing as shocking as possible (when it really isn’t lol, because we all know Greg’s answers from the various videos he has made). I’m about to watch part 2 now that my boss has left the office lol. 

The questions were basic, but it’s good to remind people his stance, especially if some Keemstar followers haven’t heard from all the videos Greg has made. Plus, you never know if his answers will change, since that tends to be how Greg’s justification works lol."

I’m a size 2 woman though (and barely even fit that lmao), but Doja inspires me to do more weights and to not get so “freaked out” about gaining weight. She’s my positive body influence."

I try to go on the reddit politics page, but the stuff they discuss is still over my head right now. There are just certain issues I have passions about, and the current president does not have those same values, so I’m now trying to look more into all this and advocate for voting information. My work already makes us do this, working for a non-profit that helps people with disabilities lol.

I feel like the severe lack of empathy, or care, in regards to people in Onision’s min—is the most highlighted in the 2nd book. I remember feeling the same towards people in my school, as a quiet and angry teen, so it also reminded me of how he captures his younger audience. I grew up as a teen in the 2006-2010’s, and we had that phase where it was “in style” to wear heavy eye make-up, crazy 80s like hair, self-harm, have depression & suicidal thoughts, and to wear skinny jeans/ also starve yourself.

Onision,fjpfjwa,t3_fekyao,1583549485.0,"The main cause for the pause, is the simple fact that this court justice system takes forever on the process, because there are other issues to take care of court that came before Onision, some even worse, believe or not. Just because we care about this case, doesn’t mean other people’s cases in court should be pushed back for this... 

Onision is getting death threats and people coming to his home... This is completely inappropriate. This man is a father, and one of the kids is old enough to sink-in the stress and anxiety this has been causing the family. I know people really started freaking out with the whole window incident, but CPS and FBI is doing what they can. We can’t give Greg more ammo to play victim.

I think it’s good to just have a silent eye on this man, which I’m sure many anti-os have been doing through his Patreon. I’m kinda confused if he still has one or not, I here that he doesn’t, but I’ve seen posts a few weeks ago, that he still has one, but that could be old posts. We have done our job with posting relentlessly on this man’s behavior, and it’s up to the possible next victim’s parents to do their job. I work with adolescents, and most parents of them monitor all internet interactions and check their phones routinely. These parents who let their teens talk to strangers all the time on the internet, need a wake up call! 

And if Chris Hansen could somehow find out Greg is grooming and meeting up with girls again, then he can get action on more direct consequences, which is why I think it’s still important to have a silent watch on this man. The whole verbal attacks on Greg is unnecessary, because there’s not one person that hasn’t said the things your going to say about him."
