AMA,ey1je00,t1_ey1id9g,1566701225.0,"It helped by taking me out of the situation(s) and teaching me how to cope with it. The worst is tied to that tho because once I got released I was thrown right back in really quickly because I hadn’t graduated yet. Yeah I do know there’s the “you have to go back at some point” thing but it doesn’t make it any easier when I did. The best was probably the other patients. I know that sounds kinda weird to someone that hasn’t been hospitalized but in the places I’ve been there’s 35 patients and usually around 10-15 staff. And depending on the unit, there’s not crazy people there. If you’re there for depression, the people around you will have depression or something similar. If you’re there for schizophrenia, then you’ll be in a more secure unit with other schizophrenics. I made more bonds there and we all help each other as we go. It’s like the whole take your own advice thing a lot tho. Patients will usually be able to talk to and help other patients easier too. And that’s not always because staff doesn’t want to help or they really don’t know how to for a specific person in a situation (they’re taught a lot in school but you never really now what to expect there) but usually because we talk to each other about something that’s up with someone more than staff sometimes. Like if someone who has claustrophobia is about to hurt themselves in a minor way and a patient stops them, they won’t be refined to a small unit that could hurt their health more because of procedure. However if someone is trying to die we do let the staff know."

It can really help in the moment but when you step outside and back into real life it can be really hard going back to everything that put you in there. I’m doing better now since I’m away from the main cause I went back the 5th time. Dealt with it and getting better."
