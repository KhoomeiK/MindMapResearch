Writing this is incredibly brave and it shows me that deep down somewhere within you, there is hope for you.

I would highly recommend talking to someone you can trust or even a therapist to work through your thoughts and feelings in order for you to start loving yourself again.

I will add that there is value to your life and you are worth more than you think you do. Since you mentioned you find getting up to study, go home then sleep is boring you, perhaps you can work on working on a hobby or activity to bring you some happiness. Take it slowly with baby steps and you will enjoy life again.

P.S your English is good"

Many NATO peacekeepers who were deployed there and were in the field came back with bad cases of PTSD.

Even though this soldier in question may not have killed innocents, for those who may have experienced or researched the Bosnian war it's a stain that's hard to remove."
