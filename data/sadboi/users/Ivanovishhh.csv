This game is quite difficult. I had to try with three two-spheres decks before i could win. Spirit and Leadership were the ones on who could break that fucking troll. Escape from Dol Guldur is insanely difficult..."

A question: How do you start to create a game? In my job we have the opportunity to teach people make better decisions and have better opportunities in life, so is it possible to design a game where you actually get better at home finances and decision making? Thanks in advance for the attention"

You only get to draw one tile although you got more than one six in the hunt. And the Fellowship add +1 for to you die in the hunt for every movement, for example if they move 3 spaces in the fellowship track within a single turn you only need a four for a succesful hunt.

2.Exactly, you maintain your 5 rerolls, but I dont understand why you would put all Nazgul in one single fight. If, by any chance, you are defeated, you would have lost of all them."
