lets remember the science here!

melatonin plays an important role in signaling your body that its nightnight time and that the body shall soon be asleep. when you sleep, your body does some amazing things. some enzyme production are completely halted  in favor of the immune system to get fucking cranking. 

guess what? 

the lower melatonin in your system, or, on average  the less time you body is told HEY, ITS NIGHNIGH TIME, ACTIVATE IMMUNE SYSTEM MAINTENANCE AND SUBSYSTEM PRODUCTIONS!, then  the less healthy and strong that organisms immuno response shall be. 

dont take my word for it - there have been sleep studies finding precisely this. 

and remember:
luminosity hitting eyelids = signal to brain its not nighnigh time. 
zero luminosity hitting eyelides = pineal gland is absolutely certain it is nighnigh time and melatonin shall be produced/secreted."

this person is going to be in your life forever. he sounds fucking awesome. but the cards just wont play out. you both need to enjoy your time and freedom and independence. long distance relationships simply dont have space for the little things that we really do need as often as possible; physical contact, those perfectly timed kisses and smiles; the hug when you really need it, etc. 

honestly dont worry about finding the person you might marry and working towards marriage. it does sound like that since you indicated this other guys bright future. let things play out naturally. you might end up marrying the guy you seem to be in love with. who knows. but what i do know, what i can tell you, is that if you guys try to make it through a long distance relationship while busy af in college, you probably wont even be friends by the end of it, let alone lovers.

you can get lovely images with some of the sensors: BMCC 2.5k is actually great, and the 4.6k with a lot if fucking work. but then people like you fanboy instead of live in reality. shit is still shit no matter how hard you try to clean it up.  

for indie projects, BM is a fucking godsend. for professional use with strict post requirements and guidelines, almost every BM camera fails by a large margin - its not just the sensor or the timecode - its the consistency of performance regardless of various conditions within physical production.
