You will always remember your friend. And now, others who never knew him, will as well. His memory will live on. I know this is very little compared to the loss, but as long as we hold the memories dear, we never completely lose someone.
Lots of love and strength to you! ❤️"

u_Fasticapp,fof51h2,t1_foetd39,1587726278.0,"Ich hab was man als diffuse Essstörung klassifiziert, weil es nicht klar einer der großen Typen zugeordnet werden kann. Am nächsten ist es aber an Bulimie. Ich bin obsessiv was Essen und mein Gewicht angeht, denke die ganze Zeit drüber nach, von was ich wie viel essen darf, restriktiv in dem was ich esse. Gefolgt von Kontrollverlust, und eine Art Daueressen. Wenn ich einmal anfange höre ich nur sehr schwer wieder auf. Das kann schonmal mehrere Stunden gehen. Gefolgt wird das ganze von massiven Schuldgefühlen, und dem Wunsch es zu kompensieren, teilweise habe ich erbrochen, manchmal Abführmittel genommen. 
Und wie hat's angefangen. Naja, ich wollte halt abnehmen, und ein Freund von mir hatte Intervallfasten empfohlen. Ich hab's ausprobiert und es hat auch ziemlich gut funktioniert. Ich habe innerhalb von 4 Wochen 3kg verloren und so gings weiter, über ein paar Monate. Es macht ja auch Sinn; wenn man weniger Zeit hat zum Essen isst man idR weniger. Bloß habe ich halt nach einer Weile wieder normal gegessen und natürlich sofort zugenommen. Das hat massive Panik ausgelöst, ich bin schier durchgedreht und hat zu dem oben beschriebenen geführt.
Dazu muss man jetzt aber sagen, dass das natürlich nicht von nichts kam, und ich schon psychisch nicht ganz auf der Höhe war. Für Leute die psychisch gesund sind, kann Intervallfasten sicher auch funktionieren. Aber jedem der schon eine gewisse Prädisposition für Essstörungen hat, dem würde ich dringend davon abraten. Der Weg raus ist immer länger als der Weg rein."

In countries with a functioning health care system the mortality rate of Tuberculosis is below 1 in 100.000, though worldwide, the number is at around 15 in 100.000.
The Tubercolosis bacterium is already infecting about 1/3 of the population worldwide. Only a very small amount of infected are experiencing the actual sickness though. You could already have it and not know about and never experience any symptoms at all."
