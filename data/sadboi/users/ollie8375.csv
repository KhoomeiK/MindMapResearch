BipolarReddit,fh6mw87,t3_f1b2gp,1581301662.0,"Don‚Äôt beat yourself yourself up. People digest guilt, pressure, stress etc all different.  Graduating is stressful - knowing that real life lies ahead is scary. Part of the reason i went to law school, so i could hide a few more years.  Happy to hear your dad was cured, mine wasnt unfortunately.  I know that going through the motions of being terrified losing your dad can be SO STRESSFUL and now that he‚Äôs cured, you are able to take a realistic look at what happened and deal/or dont deal with it. Everything and anything can be stressful to someone and not to someone else.  I also know that real anxiety doesnt  happen because of a trigger - it comes on whenever and takes no prisoners.  Have you thought about a support group i stead of a therapist? They are free of course.  Get a dr if you think you need meds but maybe you need to talk to people who are going through what you‚Äôre going through. Good luck - i hope it passes soon and i hope you remember it enough to get help when youre manic."
