bipolar2,fbxwmar,t3_eeyymd,1577202410.0,"Our ancestors had very different lives, and maybe bipolar moods were less problematic the first hundred thousand years, but if they are problematic now then medication can be a great thing. That’s how I think about it anyway. 

You could ask your doctor about your options. I take lamictal and don’t have many side effects (I do get drunk really fast but that’s about it) and I take Zyprexa as needed but not all the time. Everybody has a diff way that meds affect them, and if you want to be taking meds then you def have options."
bipolar2,f2dcey8,t3_dczrnf,1570150595.0,"Yes. I can remember biking literally all day every day, and I typically lose lots of weight in hypomania. I have underweight issues when I am stable, so it took me a while to realize that it was also correlated pretty strongly with my highs."
bipolar,f2dc2is,t3_dcpoqo,1570150346.0,So simple and so beautifully put.
bipolar2,f0u6q9s,t3_d6h3oy,1568935082.0,"Same. Hypersexuality is a huge embarassing problem for me. I’m gay, so my community has a pretty wide tolerance for sexual variation, and I know that it is part of the illness, but I always feel like such a skeezewad after coming down and having to look at my behavior."
bipolar2,f0kdlsx,t3_d4vzki,1568676909.0,"Lamictal saved my life and brought me clarity, and I am happy for you that it is doing good things too. I know the feeling of being behind where you thought you would be. I discovered over time that things change super quickly, and you will def not be feeling behind forever. I have felt ahead and behind, and it took me a long time to see that others may be nailing some parts of their life, like maybe career, but other parts of their lives can be kind of a mess. 2 years of feeling behind is torture when it’s your reality, but it will change and you will start to almost forget how it used to feel."
bipolar2,f04pqk8,t3_d3n0kq,1568392846.0,"Me too, varies infp and enfp. I think baseline infp but it took me a while to have the insight to know that"
bipolar2,ezgagdb,t3_d0z0hk,1567894072.0,"I get a lot of facial tension, sore from laughing and smiling, and my shoulders get sore too. People tell me my pupils are dilated a lot, and I think that is part of why people sometimes think I am on something. In addition to the speedy crazy behavior obv."
BipolarReddit,ez0al87,t3_czqqp0,1567633993.0,"This illness affects so many parts of our lives and bodies, so I think there are a lot of different ways to say it honestly. When I have felt like some explanation was necessary in the past, I have called it a mood disorder or a circadian rhythm problem. Energy disorder sounds totally fine to me."
bipolar2,eyov57p,t3_cxxphr,1567283869.0,"For me it has been hard sometimes to distinguish a little depression from stability, since when stable I also kinda miss the energy and inspiration I have when I’m manic. When I am on the right meds I feel clear and ready for the world. I would not like to be in the place that it seems like you are, so I am feeling with you rn. Btw if your name is Jeff, I am Jeff too."
bipolar2,eyf9qlr,t3_cwub2j,1567045517.0,"The worst thing imaginable for me is losing my twin sister, and I am sure she feels the same. Sometimes that almost makes it worse when I am so close to suicide, but it has kept me alive. I can’t destroy her life like that."
bipolar2,ey7alnh,t3_cvw48g,1566876584.0,"infp. One of the things that makes sense to me now is that for my whole life up to diagnosis I was super confused about the difference between extroversion and introversion, and now I have been able to pick out Me from how I behave in episodes."
BipolarReddit,ey4d0jv,t3_cvhqxk,1566788419.0,"YES. In retrospect, the pdoc who prescribed it to me did not do a thorough screen for bipolar, but of course at the time I had no idea about any of that and anyway was seriously depressed. I hit the roof. I was feeling so good I never even went back and just finished the initial amount I was prescribed. After a while the episode ran its course, but it was ugly and I blamed myself completely and got pretty depressed again after I came down. It was years before I had a life crisis significant enough to go back for treatment and was flagged right away for possible bipolar by a more competent pdoc. I take lamotrigine and olanzapine now, and it has been life changing. I take responsibility for my own life and my own choices, but I also am kinda bitter about being screwed over with Prozac when I shouldn’t have been prescribed it in the first place. I hear so much about SSRIs that people casually throw around, and I wonder how many people get caught in that trap like we did."
bipolar2,ey4bzra,t3_cvhiaa,1566787567.0,"Sometimes I feel pretty shitty about the ways I have smashed up my life, but tbh I really was doing the best that I knew how to do at the time. Knowing what I know now, everything would be different. Knowing what I knew then, nothing could have been different. Still beat myself up a lot more than I probably should."
bipolar2,ex3xlnl,t3_crbpfb,1565993810.0,"For me it was overwhelming for a while and sometimes still is. I think about it as worries and things that I need help to change, and the label is kinda less important. I also don’t tell many people, either just reference depression or call it a mood disorder and just leave it at that, when I have to bring it up at all."
bipolar2,esatbrk,t3_c6pd18,1561768223.0,"Yes. When I am up I get super moved by how beautiful life is, and I see it everywhere in all kinds of stupid things that normally are just everyday normal things to me when I am baseline"
bipolar2,es7ai0d,t3_c67j89,1561666992.0,"I still got hypo on Lamictal. Usually my episodes are pretty quick and not too horrible, but one of them lasted 2 weeks and I fucked up my living situation by trying to have sex with my roommate’s boyfriend and my landlord and almost lost my job. So that convinced me I needed something more, and now I take zyprexa as needed, usually start it up when my sleep goes below 6 hours for a couple days. I am kind of afraid I will wait too long one day and then not want to take it bc I am feeling too good, but so far it has worked out for me. Zyprexa is strong stuff."
bipolar2,eqqp091,t3_bz4ha9,1560227268.0,34/m no hair loss. Amazing for my depression and completely life changing. Doesn’t do much for my hypomania so I take olanzapine as needed. My main worry is depression anyway so god bless lamictal
bipolar2,ep92fpr,t3_bu6l8u,1559103349.0,"I always have an intense inner monologue and think it is just fine. When I am hypo I start saying it out loud, knowing that it is weird but not caring. Also laugh a lot to myself, for a long time like a couple minutes straight without stopping. Sometimes it is hard for me to know what is just myself (super thoughtful and not afraid to be different) and what is unhelpful hypomania, until it gets kind of out of control."
BipolarReddit,ep90zcx,t3_bu0xbg,1559102753.0,"Lamotrigine monotherapy here (magic!!) with olanzapine as needed for hypomania. Tbh it has been really hard to have enough self control to manage my own olanzapine dosing, and that is with hypo not full mania. But consistent olanzapine affected my weight and made it hard to wake up in the morning, so I am happy (?) with this compromise, kind of."
BipolarReddit,ep8yso0,t3_bu40xq,1559101833.0,"Meds for life. 100% sure that it will be suicide without them, and I think I deserve better than that."
bipolar2,eonqn1l,t3_bsi1qf,1558719137.0,"I take lamotrigine and super love it. My main problem is depression, and getting on lamotrigine was like night and day for me. I also do olanzapine as needed for hypomania, but that is more like a couple times a year."
