depression,f1fx3xz,t1_f1fu96i,1569454974.0,"Thank you, I don’t have anyone to really help me out I’ve always done it on my own since my mother kicked me out when I was 15... and i don’t have a father.. & If this man can’t be here for me now then he doesn’t need to be there for me if this were to ever occur again and I freaking hope not because this is all just too much Im only still alive because of my kids if it weren’t for them I’d kill myself already...."
depression,f1fwz50,t1_f1fvxqr,1569454888.0,"Well I gave him another chance because he was showing me he “changed” by going to classes and taking counseling & his behavior changed with me and I finally felt like he was the man I always wanted him to be. My counselor told me that I could be going through all of this because of the trauma I went through in my past & since I never really tried to do anything about my mental health it just has gotten worst on me... which is why I went to see my dr last month and he prescribed me Zoloft but the side effects were so bad on me. So just I stopped taking them.. I have my first appointment with a psychiatrist next week and hoping that she’ll be able to help me...trust me your not the first person to sound like an a** and ask me this...so I’m not bothered, hell sometimes even I wonder why...."
depression,f1fvt7n,t1_f1ft8xi,1569454144.0,"Im just becoming tired of it all, I already don’t feel good everyday. The last thing I need is him treating me like this, he’s 28 years old and maturity has never been his thing, he sucks at communicating and just ignores me and when he does communicate he plays victim, or just starts talking about HE feels before even acknowledging anything that came out of my mouth. I don’t have too many people in my life, i don’t have a father, my step father molested me when I was 13. My mother and I don’t talk because she put me through so much growing up... so I just love her from a distance I live an hour away from my family so no one ever comes to visit me, and no one ever really talks to me. I grew up in a very broken home. I’m only close with 2 of my sisters which I told them about what I’m going through but they already have so much going on in their lives to be worried about me. So I just stopped reaching out to them. It’s just me and my two kids who is all I have honestly. He makes me feel even worst and does it right in front of our kids. I try to talk about it in private because they don’t need to be hearing any of it, but he’s just so careless... i don’t have friends out here i tend to isolate myself I’m not the best at making friends and with everything going on right now all i want to do is just be alone.... people can just be so disappointing"
depression,f1ekopj,t3_d8z7p2,1569424415.0,My moms the reason I’m this way and she denies TIL this day lol I wonder sometimes why didn’t she just abort 🙄 i didn’t ask to be here ... !
mentalillness,f1b8wbo,t3_d8gwla,1569327882.0,"I was in the same position as you a few weeks ago. I had no idea how to get help, or even what to do or who to call??? I was having really bad anxiety and my panic attacks became worst and more often as well as depression. So I called my doctor and he recommended I go to the ER so I go and they recommended I see a psychiatrist & to try therapy/groups since I’ve been through some trauma growing up. I would bring it up at your doctor visit, maybe he/she can give you options based on the the answers you give them. I was prescribed Zoloft.. but the side effects were so mild for me I just couldn’t take it anymore so I stopped them he gave me a different kind but honestly the pills have just been sitting in my bathroom cabinet because I’m afraid of feeling extremely sick again .. my next plan is seeing a psychiatrist... so that they can tell me what is it that’s really “wrong” with me I guess... your not alone it’s up to you on how you’ll make the first step into getting help and you already have because you know your not okay right now and want to get help... well done !"

mentalillness,f0rnu9s,t3_d6bknc,1568888562.0,"I was prescribed sertraline and hated the side effects, I was always dull 90% of the time! It’s like my mind tried to make me believe I was happy but I knew deep down inside I wasn’t. I as well didn’t feel any emotions everything’s just dull, all I ever wanted to do was sleep... perhaps your doctor can prescribe you a different medication?"
