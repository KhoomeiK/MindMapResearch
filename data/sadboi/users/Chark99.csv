whatcarshouldIbuy,fmsbm7u,t3_fwvqxe,1586351887.0,"GTI is very nice inside and drives nice, the fiesta feels cheaper (being based on a base model) but you feel way more cause of the lower weight and just how planted it is. Fun little car I‚Äôd go fiesta if you want a nicer interior without German tax go focus st but they aren‚Äôt as fun as the fiesta and the 1.6 in the fiesta is more solid than the 2.0 in the focus. Also make sure you check out the Hyundai Elantra sport and a forgotten about Kia Forte5 SX, the forts is a bit harder to find though at least here 

I drove the veloster N also, pretty quick and the adaptive settings are pretty neat, I though the shifter feel was a bit odd maybe not broken in enough it was hard to get clutch feel, but I liked the veloster N a lot as well. Mazda 3s are pretty fun for an everyday car while still being comfortable and having a nice interior!

Be sure to test drive all of your choices."

news,fme3wq3,t3_fujx91,1585988284.0,FFS I am a Walmart employee. This company is the second largest retailer in the United States behind only the government including military. They make about $26 billion per year (AFTER EXPENSES) That new swing open gate when you enter the store has a little alarm when you try to exit through it the wrong way. Majority of people pay no attention to the gate or the alarm and simply push through it to get their way. No one will pay attention to some paper signs hung up if they pay no attention to a beeping physical gate.
