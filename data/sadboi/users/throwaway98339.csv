Edmonton,f066u9v,t1_f064r6d,1568430713.0,Thank you for this. I do have an ongoing battle with depression. But it has become quite clear that it is even harder now to obtain any kind of support since the UCP came in. It is a shame mental health services are so greatly underfunded. I am currently an inpatient voluntarily at Alberta Hospital Edmonton and it is evident things are not maintained due to lack of funding. AISH would help me in the long run as I have had an inconsistent employment pattern and in and out of UofA psyche ward for 25 years. I figure I have a shot at applying but it sounds like a tedious time consuming process.

depression,eyztfu4,t1_eyzrt2x,1567624546.0,"Well to be fair I don't have a home to speak of and nowhere I can go. And no job. And no money. And no support. I will be likely facing the street again and not eating for days if I can't get housing and employment lined up before I am discharged. I'm assuming you have those at least going for you. And yet here I am. Ultimately it is your life. No one can tell you what you need to do. But you could consider it from someone who's been there. If you haven't tried meds before or even if you have, there are sometimes different ones. I tried many before giving up on meds and doctors altogether 15 years ago. I have fought depression since 15, the last 15 years with no meds. It only got worse. I am now 40 and decided to give it another try and I have found something that is helping me want to live again. Your future is in your own hands. Choose wisely."
depression,eyzqpeh,t3_czosm4,1567623160.0,Not sure where you are located or whether or not you have insurance but here in Canada health care is covered so I went to the emergency room and admitted myself and told them I was planning to kill myself and needed help. They took it seriously and got me admitted to a psych hospital and on meds and within 3 days I am feeling better already. Not to mention I have a place to sleep eat and shower now as I was living in my car for the past month.
depression,eyx2nm0,t3_czacie,1567543436.0,Best thing I can recommend if you are feeling this much pain and suffering emotionally and want to end your life is to reach out for help and admit yourself to the emergency room. If you are actually thinking suicidal thoughts and present as depressed and ready to give up they will take you seriously and hopefully get you the help you need. For me this has been the difference of life and death had I not done the same this past weekend. I was living in my car the past month and not sleeping or eating well and was ready to throw myself in the river. The ER psych team was amazing and got me a bed in a mental ward and administered me an anti-depressant and within 2 days I feel better already and they have been overwhelmingly supportive and understanding not to mention I now have a bed to sleep in and 3 meals a day. They have helped me to realize there are resources out there I otherwise wouldn't have known about had I not reached out for help. I wish I had done it 15 years ago. Depression is a very real thing. You don't have to suffer like this. And you can't fight it on your own. Believe me I tried for 15 years without help. I thought I could battle it alone. Had I not checked myself in I likely wouldn't be here today and I have 3 kids. The depression took me to such a dark place not even they could keep me from wanting to die. Get the help you need. This goes for anyone here reading this. We each deserve to live a fulfilled life.

Edmonton,eyseqfc,t1_eyrsek3,1567395708.0,"Thank you for sharing your experience. One question I have is as I have been put at a level 2 certificate up to a month treatment is available, do I have to be presenting suicidal ideation on a consistent basis in order to still be admitted to a program?"
Edmonton,eysazip,t1_eysahw4,1567392360.0,Agreed. Unfortunately we are all victims of the capitalist system designed to keep us either a contributing member or a castaway left to die should we not participate. Even if we are trying to.
Edmonton,eysas9s,t1_eyqz3oc,1567392185.0,"It does seem to me to be on a case by case basis and depends on level of crisis and whether you are actually in dire need based on their criteria. Had I come the day after and maybe not been as suicidal at the moment I may have likely been dismissed as just depressed, not actually suicidal which I was. Although they should take every case seriously I have seen quite a few patients come through being quite rude and difficult to deal with so they are quickly shuffled out the door they just walked through."
Edmonton,eyrln55,t1_eyq442i,1567371824.0,Thank you. Yes they did mention a social case worker to help me with community integration. I am hoping some kind of transitional housing otherwise I am right back on the street after I am done treatment.
Edmonton,eyrgg7h,t1_eyrfh09,1567367987.0,To be honest I couldn't believe some of the patients in here and just the total lack of appreciation they have towards the staff. I get it when someone wants to kill themselves and are being held against their will but it's no reason to lash out against the people who are just trying to do their jobs and help others. I haven't always been treated this well. I have generally been treated as a hopeless addict and honestly was expecting to be again because I am homeless and although not on drugs I look like an addict. They were nothing but caring. More than my own father was.
Edmonton,eyrd7p9,t1_eyrcwal,1567365615.0,This is true. And why I was surprised. I have been cast away before but I guess they took me seriously enough this time.
depression,eyr3mql,t1_eyr36on,1567360252.0,This is very true. My past experiences with antidepressants have been mixed. Mostly just negative side affects not much in the way of decreasing symptoms. Just hoping I guess to hear more positive than negative experiences with this one.
Edmonton,eyqu1ol,t3_cy739e,1567353556.0,Thank you all for the comments and show of support. This has been more support here than anyone I know personally.  I am going to get back on my feet and when I am in the position I will give back one day any way I can.

Edmonton,eyqttql,t1_eyqrilf,1567353393.0,In all fairness I have been treated poorly in past hospital visits. Treated like a junkie when I wasn't even on drugs. I feel very lucky. Others have been discharged while I have been here and I feel guilty in a sense of being admitted and getting a bed and not them.

Edmonton,eymqioc,t1_eymq3aa,1567216847.0,"Thank you. You have no idea how much this helps. I have had nothing but constant rejection and oh that's too bad from all angles. Potential employers, friends and family and my ex. No one can truly understand the financial and emotional ruin that sometimes results after divorce unless they go through it themselves and I don't expect them to. But just having some understanding and support makes all the difference. The Reddit community has especially been helpful."
Edmonton,eymp90c,t1_eymp02b,1567215758.0,You are right. And they are the only reason I am seeking help. I can't leave them. But I'm afraid if I cross the line there won't be anything to stop me. Especially if I start to think how they are better off without me. Maybe who I am now is not the best version of their father but I am still hopeful I can turn this around in time.
Edmonton,eymp0mz,t1_eymoq16,1567215560.0,Thank you for this. There is a good chance that is the case and I have just taken it the wrong way. He has just never been able to be supportive for me in time of need by showing understanding other than offering money.

Edmonton,eymnsw6,t1_eymndyz,1567214530.0,Thank you. I am afraid if I admit myself voluntarily and admit I may be suicidal I won't get to see my kids again.  I had to give up my custody temporarily to my ex after I lost my job and had to give notice to move out with nowhere to go. The police told me to go my parents and that was a mistake. I'd like to get out of this situation I have fallen into and just need some time to get back on my feet. But the streets are taking me down a dark hole.
Edmonton,eymn5qr,t3_cxpnla,1567213968.0,"Thank you for the responses this is way more helpful than anything from anyone I know personally.

homeless,exbtkof,t1_exbt4a4,1566137807.0,"No problem, don't find out the hard way like I did and if you have a newer car with keyless entry disable it! Even if you have to remove the battery out of the key fob. All someone has to do is open the door if your key fob is within proximity, even if you lock it from inside. Happened to me last night too luckily the guy ran off rather than stab me. Also do not leave anything on in the car, radio, door open etc and don't charge your phone if you have one without the car running.

Kids concerts, seats on opposite ends of the gym, Graduation, seats on opposite ends of the auditorium. Weddings, no reason to sit near each other or talk.

And it seemed the longer I tried to pretend everything was fine the more I realized it wasn't really. I think getting as far away from this place as possible while not with my kids would be the thing that would pull me out of this. Seeing her and knowing we are no longer a family and no longer do family things together is what brings me down. And yes you are right, my kids love me and need me and I haven't been erased by them. I am going to learn to surf and skydive and ride a motorcycle and when I come back on the weekends I have my kids I am going to take them out to learn to surf at the local mall waterpark.

Divorce,ewku8hw,t1_ewkt3st,1565494769.0,Thank you for this. Especially coming from someone who can relate to feeling eliminated. Thing is I have been applying to all the jobs I qualify for but it seems I am overqualified for them now at 40 and don't even get called but instead just a lame rejection email. Just trying to get temp cash labour work just to put enough gas in the car and food in me to get through day to day and hopefully keep my cell from getting cut off. Am behind on child support to boot. I know it's just a rock and a hard place at the moment but I tried for 2 years to keep my job and house and shared custody and it just didn't make sense anymore to shuffle the kids back and forth and spend the majority of my time earning a high income just to turn around and spend nearly half of it on housing costs and still have to pay child support even with 50/50. Maybe a part of me wants to admit that I just wasn't good at it. And I'm not sure if I could do it over again. I know I need to pick myself back up but the further I get away from my old life the more hesitant I am in trying to acheive it again.
