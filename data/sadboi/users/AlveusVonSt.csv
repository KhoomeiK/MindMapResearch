depression,fatiyi6,t3_eaj99b,1576338660.0,I wish i had emotions again but i suppressed them to the point where i dont feel anything and do anything i want without consequence. If your willing just stop expressing them and eventually they go away.

SuicideWatch,exqbvb5,t3_cu19z5,1566500413.0,"Plastic bag. Wrap it around and get some tubing to connect to a helium tank. It has the same type of stuff as oxygen so you wont be tempted to rip off the bag. You would die soon after. 

What you need:

Helium Tank - cheap

Tubing - cheap

Tape - for a firm hold

Strong Bag - cheap

You can buy these on amazon or ebay."
