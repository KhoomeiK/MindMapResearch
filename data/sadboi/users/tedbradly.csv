The professor who conducted the survey concludes that half ""can be described as antisemitic which is a very high rate.’’ Five times higher, in fact, __then__ among Flemish-speaking Belgians, who historically have been relatively anti-Jewish.

It's such a poorly written article that it even includes verses of inclusion from the Quran:

> O ye People of the Book!* believe in what We have (now) revealed, __confirming what was (already) with you__ [the Torah...], before We change the face and fame of some (of you) beyond all recognition, and turn them hindwards, or __curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers__ [affirming what came before], for the decision of Allah Must be carried out.

I've experienced all of that as well as negative symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g. total anhedonia and anergia - I'd sit with zero desire to do anything for 16 hours at a time. The idea of listening to music felt like work). The trick is to reason. Your logical centers are not gone. Even during my psychosis, I said I don't know or I don't think that plenty of times. The trick there was to ignore the suggestions as intrusive thoughts altogether. The mere fact of considering the proposition as anything other than a waste of time was a gateway to wasting time and wasting life.

I had severe delusions about thinking it'd be a good idea to kill someone for a small violation of my rights or that other people were trying to kill me. It gets getting better once to remember sanity and use it thereafter to recursively better yourself. The trick is taking personal responsibility for everything despite the illness having been present. It doesn't matter that I was delusional. I still chose to believe those things. I'm better now, because I was able to genuinely apologize to people I scared or mistreated during my psychosis and mania as well as those I hurt through inaction during my depression and negative symptoms.

Honestly, I don't know why you're arguing with me. Other than medication, which has the possibility of eliminating the urges / misunderstandings / etc. altogether, what else can you say other than ""think more"", ""act slower"", and ""take personal responsibility""? Literally every other suggestion will imply letting your illness fester as you bemoan your existence, and that's what I see on here very often.

JoeRogan,fr0afdi,t3_gljqtu,1589788819.0,"Makes no sense to me to be against his opinion so much. I watch random ones of his podcasts from the past, but after seeing the hate here, I watched a more recent one to get a read on what people hate so much. For the record, I am for quarantine, especially since I have many older people in my family and asthma. Yet I still understand his viewpoint is a viable alternative option. He's basically a fan of herd immunity in those that should be fine while isolating the people who are high risk. I'm not for his opinion since there's a certain percent of even low risk people who will die and since there's talk of the possibility of it permanently hurting peoples' lungs for life. I also thought it could cause a huge issue if it overloaded the hospitals / hospitals ran out of supplies - it'd be a major failure in our policy if people who could have survived died due to running out of supplies (both caretakers and regular patients). But even that, he declared it's not an issue during his podcast as if he considered that himself and found it not to be a factor. I'm still on the fence about that particular issue since it sounds reasonable it could happen since it happened in other countries.

Still, the main point is he's not a blubbering moron and has given the issue enough thought to where I see his solution as a viable option despite ultimately disagreeing with it. To go even further than disagreeing with it - calling it idiotic or thinking it warrants censorship - is ludacris IMO. There were even politicians in the beginning weighing the herd immunity option as best, given the massive impact full quarantine will have on the economy. That's another one of his arguments he made - that he sees his solution has the cost of more infections, but it's just too expensive to quarantine all rather than quarantine only those with high risk.

I entered the podcast thinking there's only one viable option and left knowing there's at least two.

Lastly, he nitpicked at how absurd some of the recommendations are. An example he gave is you can fish but no sitting. I agree fully with him on this point even though it doesn't change my ultimate opinion about what should be done. What is wrong with fishing sitting down if you can fish standing up? That was a solid point. In the end, I thought his opinion was a fresh stance in an extremely routine scenario where hearing the same arrogance from one side parroted by all has gotten boring and annoying. Stop being such idiotic, arrogant pricks and actually address what he's saying rather than just calling him a moron.

edit: He is also for getting tested and quarantining those people too. He tests his guests and himself. He said he's been tested 10 times already."

There's only so many addicts in total since there's so many users in total. The percent of users that turn addict is quite small. Occasional use at a party or something isn't an addiction.

Phenibut, on the other hand, has people fooled by the smooth experience way more often. What ends up happening is they'll try it a few days in a row, become an insomniac for some number of days, and then make the tough decision to deal with the insomnia, which is torturous, or keep dosing, which only compounds the underlying problem.

His opponents are usually not newbie enough to get caught out during this phase, but in matches that aren't the top 100 players in the world, you can also use it to secure kills often. E.g. you kill their wave, and they have to run back to avoid damage from the creep wave. Then you invis in, hit them, and go behind them and then start hitting them. If they stay to hit you back, you + creeps will either secure the kill or you'll have much more efficient damage to them than they have hitting you.

If you're jungling, an obvious use is to hit camps. If you use it to go between camps, time it to where you get the damage in at the tail end of it. You might need a few clarities to keep spamming it for efficient farming. It's much better to use gold to replenish mana while gaining levels and gold faster overall than it is to keep your mana up from not using it while farming / leveling slower.

In team fights, you can often go in aggressively, isolating a support in the backlines and killing him off quickly. If you take too much damage, you can ult out and reverse all the damage and then plan for round two. If they can't do much more damage to you, you might invis in once again to pick off more enemies, or if you fear dying, you can play more conservative / save it to run away.

I see this one a lot in lower play. Don't go for linkens anymore. That was a build from like 5 years ago. I mainly see people getting damage items on him, abusing his ability to sneak deep in to assassinate supports in 2-4 hits. Things like diffusal blade, crit, maelstrom, and desolator seem more popular in higher play. If you must get a linkens, it probably makes sense to buy it after you get one or two damage items.

Schizoid,fqu7voa,t3_gkw7fd,1589653731.0,"I took it, because there are several studies that it helps with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (anergia, anhedonia, etc.). The studies typically use 2 grams/d, but there was one case study of a person whose symptoms got worse on 2 grams/d yet better on 1 gram/d. When it got worse, it enhanced his positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, etc.).

At the time, I was highly schizophrenic, so it was difficult to judge if it was doing anything. During that time, I was also suffering from insomnia, and it was hard to say if it helped that, hurt it, or did nothing. However, glycine has been shown to help with sleep, so sarcosine, being a glycine reuptake inhibitor, might help sleep. It's certainly no substitute for an antipsychotic, and the studies that do use it use it as an adjunct to an AP, not as a replacement for them. I became asymptomatic in my positive symptoms with olanzapine. It might be worth a try again now that I only have negative symptoms remaining.

If you're suffering from anhedonia, anergia, motivational issues, etc. it might be worth trying it out for a few weeks to see if it helps you. While the studies I've seen are all adjuncts to AP and for schizophrenia rather that schizoid PD, the studies existing hint that it could help other types of people than schizophrenics with energy, pleasure, motivation, etc. It's, of course, not a sure thing since the populations are different, but it's still a good lead to follow.

DotA2,fqqjcot,t1_fqne9be,1589566531.0,"Your recommendation has a major flaw in it - it is just rewording the assertion that there should be no smurfs. ""Make it illegal"" isn't an actual strategy for dealing with smurfs, because it's just rewording ""there should be no smurfs"". How exactly do you detect smurfs? See, Valve already has that strategy in place. From what I understand, if it detects odd play, it can more quickly adjust their MMR up or down, depending on what type of smurf it is. This strategy seems more reasonable than banning smurfs, because while a boost or loss in MMR is a manageable event in the case of someone actually changing as a player [not smurfing but activating the anti smurf code], banning one or more accounts ""linked"" to them isn't.

Just think about how much of a nightmare smurf detection is in a game as complex as DotA. You can have players spam pick and go from rank crusader to legend V - It gets posted all the time on here. And then they pick other heroes and severely underperform while they were severely overperforming with that one hero they were good at. Do you just boost their MMR in that case and possibly take it away faster upon detecting the odd play, or do you just ban them, because you're asserting that should be the solution?

I think Valve has the right approach. Just change the MMR to nullify the effect of the smurf."

I was much better off before I became schizophrenic.

Just as a simple example, when I was schizophrenic, I mistreated people due to the delusion that they were trying to kill me. How are delusions ever to be classified as anything other than a weakness? They also imply people can treat *you* badly or irrationally since they might leverage a delusion as a justification for the incorrect treatment.

I'm not saying I hurt schizophrenics or do anything bad toward them. I just treat them with more caution since they could potentially mistreat me due to false beliefs. Is that so crazy? Well, if it is, you can then blame my schizophrenia, thereby proving the theory you think is incorrect."

> It is widely accepted in the scientific, medical and psychological fields that schizophrenia is hereditary and has a genetic aetiology. You’re partly right in regards to the scientific community identifying the exact genetic framework of schizophrenia however they have identified some of it. For example the more-137 deletion chromosome is present in those with schizophrenia. There are more actual genetics that have been identified but not all of them have been discovered. The genetic aetiology of schizophrenia is much more significant than a lightweight correlation.

It is a mere correlation. It's not the case that having the genetics implies necessarily getting any mental illness, schizophrenia included. It's even the case that twins only share a high percentage of cooccuring schizophrenia, but since it's not all genetic, they don't have a 100% cooccurrence. 

> The dopamergenic hypothesis of schizophrenia has been prevalent for in excess of 60 years and is well established in the scientific community, hence why pharmaceuticals treating schizophrenia target dopamine neurotransmitters. The glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia is fairly recent (20 years) but is becoming more prevalent in the scientific community.

You have this backward. The dopamine hypothesis for schizophrenia exists, because dopamine antagonists seem to treat positive symptoms. They didn't start off with the hypothesis and then propose antipsychotics as a cure.

> I think you are mistaken in regards to being able to develop schizophrenia without the correlating genetic predisposition. It is possible to go through psychosis if you don’t have the genes for schizophrenia, this is transient in nature and generally triggered by stress, trauma or amohetamine/methamphetamine or other substance abuse. Psychosis is not the same as schizophrenia, as said before psychosis can be transient and schizophrenia is a chronic condition.

It doesn't matter what you think. You can develop schizophrenia without any of the genetic predispositions to it, and you can be completely healthy despite having the genetics for it. That's because we don't know what causes schizophrenia. And as I already mentioned, even identical twins can have one with it and one without it.

Some forms of vitamins are better than others. I have a litmus test I use to see if a vitamin is good or bad. I just check what kind of folate it has in it. Folate activates receptors in your body, producing a response. However, folic acid blocks up receptors without the response. It clogs your system up. While it does that, it slowly converts to a form the body can use that is bioactive. Your supplement uses folic acid, which isn't good, so it's probably using cheaper ingredients for all its other stuff too. You want a multivitamin that has methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) instead. I've checked before, and every supplement with MTHF has quality ingredients for its other ingredients too."
