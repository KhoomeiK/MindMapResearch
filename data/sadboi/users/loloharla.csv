It was supposed to be a temporary 4 day thing and became a 5 month thing. They stole money and medication from me. Ate all my food, broke my things, never locked the door, etc. one of them kicked my front door down when I locked them out and it broke the entire frame.

From the first moment of trouble I went to the property managers for help and they were exceptionally kind and understanding. They tried their best to help me. They came over several times and also scheduled meetings with my roommate to reiterate that only the two of us were on the lease and therefore the others had to leave.

Finally they offered to begin a formal eviction notice to both of us but would drop the one on me after he left but it became unnecessary because he finally decided to move out by himself.

The moment he walked out that door for good was the most intense relief I've ever experienced. I literally fell to the ground and sobbed for a full 10 minutes.

All this to say, if the sister had always been a good tenant and is on good terms with the managers its worth speaking to them first. 

Explain that it was supposed to be temporary, feel free to lean heavily into the whole ""its family thing."" And “supposed to be temporary” etc.

Anxietyhelp,fdylblz,t3_enc2o8,1578781031.0,"This is going to be long so forgive me

About 5 years ago I had such bad anxiety, depression, and OCD that I had to be admitted to the hospital so I am very familiar with this subject. Now I’m living my dream and almost never get anxious.

I started meditating ten to twenty minutes a day using guided apps like Breathe and Calm. If it was a really bad day I would meditate a lot more.

I started going on very long walks I’m talking 1-3 hours depending on how bad my day was. Wear headphones and listen to upbeat dance music.

I started seeing a great therapist at least once every week and it helped so freaking much.

I went to the gym and took fun exercise classes.

This one is going to sound rude and I remember being offended when my therapist told me but I don’t know how else to say it. You need to change the way you think about things and how you see the world. It sounds like when someone says “just don’t think about it” or “stop worrying so much” or “just be happy.” That’s not what I mean at all

For example

You have a really important job interview that you’ve completely bombed and you’re probably freaking out and about to have a panic attack. Your brain is saying “you idiot you just failed so hard” “everyone is judging you” you’ll never have a good job “ etc.

Stop those thoughts in their tracks, you need to talk kinder to yourself.

Would you let someone say that about your best friend? Then why are you saying it to yourself?? Always be gentle, have forgiveness for yourself. You’re human you make mistakes don’t beat yourself up over it.

Back to the job interview, instead of speaking rudely to yourself, instead say “well it could have gone better but I learned some lessons about what not to do and now I know how to improve.” 
Or say “hey I tried my best and that’s what matters.”

I have so many great mantras I use to stop or prevent my bad thoughts.

The first is “I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it.” Basically stop thinking about things in the future that aren’t guaranteed to happen. Focus on today, right now. 

I would think of these bizarre scenarios and freak myself out over things that would never even happen. I vividly remember years ago telling my therapist i couldn’t go away to college because I’d have to live in a dorm and if I live in a dorm I would have to share a bathroom with a lot of people and if I have to share my bathroom with a lot of people eventually I’m going to get diarrhea and everyone would know and they’d make fun me and so I just won’t go.   ???? Like what?? I won’t go to college because I’d have to poop in a public bathroom? 

Now everything that’s not immediately in need of attention? I’ll cross that bridge when I get to it.

Another one is “what’s the worst that could happen?” This one sounds bad but let me give an easy example.

When I go out with my friends and one of them sees a cute guy the whole night she’ll want to talk to him but won’t because she’s too scared. I ask “what’s the worst thing that could happen? He’ll say no? Okay well that’s his loss then.” 

Or maybe I’m assembling a new bed frame and a part won’t correctly fit together so I’m freaking out. Wait a minute. What’s the worst that could happen? I need to call the company and get a replacement? That’s not the end of the world.

Anxiety is all about what ifs so to heal yourself you need to stop those what ifs with new healthier mantras.

Another thing that pretty much never fails is the buddy system. If anything scares you and makes you super anxious ask your best friend if they could do it with you. Having someone else to experience things with is so much better than being alone. I’m so good at the buddy system that when I’m traveling somewhere new and don’t speak the language I’ll go around asking if anyone is bilingual and doesn’t mind me tagging along. This has helped me through countless border runs.

When you’re in the grips of anxiety and it’s really bringing you down just remember you’re not alone and almost everyone these days has at least a little experience with it.

There’s no one cure for anxiety but there are so many different changes you can make that will really improve your life. 

It’s been a few years but now I’m one of the chillest most go with the flow people out there. Nothing really ruffles my feathers And I can do just about anything."

I love convincing friends to come to karaoke with me. I'll tell them I'm really good but they're always like ""yeah, ok, we'll see about that."" and then afterwards they admit they were skeptical but that I really am a year singer. 

I've also learned to always let the other person go first because no one wants to go after me.

The second is that I'm the most extroverted person. I'm amazing at giving compliments. Bot a day goes by where I don't compliment at least 3 or 4 people. I can make friends super easy. I literally walk down the street, compliment a girls outfit, 20 minutes later we're friends.

And the third is that I'm really good at helping people remember what they were talking about
Its hard to describe but you know when you're having a conversation and you get off topic then say ""damn! What were we talking about??"" I'll list all the things we talked about until they remember

One time I told a new friend about this odd talent and once again he was like ""umm ok if you say so"" but then an hour later he forgot what he was talking about and I did it then he said ""ok wow you ARE good at that!"" that was the first time someone acknowledged I was good at that and it made me feel really good"

I used to be a super deep sleeper and I could fall asleep any where. No I have terrible insomnia and the sound of people approaching my room or knocking on my door is really triggering. I'm lucky to get more than 5 hours a night and anything could wake me up.

I'm such a good customer that servers fight over who gets me and I regularly get free things. 

I'm extremely nice. As soon as the waiter comes up I'll ask their name, how are you? Has it been busy, have you had any asshole customers? Then we'll talk about those customers roundly abusing them together. 

Throughout my meal if I need more sauce, another refill, etc. I always say things like ""if possible . . ."" or ""whenever you get the time"" and ""no rush."" while also regularly saying ""eh no worries!"" ""thank you so much you're the best."" 

I make sure to remember their name so I can casually drop it in conversation or easily get their attention if necessary. Plus, people have names for a reason so might as well use it. I think saying their names helps them see me as more than their every day customer.

In my hometown, which is super small and completely lacking in variety, I have about 6 restaurants I visit frequently enough that the staff knows me. At 2 of them, the servers flat out told me I'm their favorite and they arm wrestle, coin toss, or rock paper scissors to see who gets me. And at one restaurant I saw with my own eyes one of the waitresses run from the kitchen, yank the menu away from another server, and then seat me in her section instead, it was super heart warming. 

And of course I tip extremely well. I'm talking the %30 minium kind of good tip.

I extend this niceness to every part of my life. I regularly get free desserts, sides, drinks, discounts on clothes, upgraded rooms. I've gotten the resident discount at a foreign hosptial, and my personal favorite-  hundreds of dollars of auto services done for free.

Some people mistakenly believe that if you're rude you'll get better treatment. You know those ""the customer is always right"" Karen dick faces. But I can confidently say that the opposite is true."

AskReddit,f45ex2c,t3_djct2y,1571374446.0,"I have an unnatural obsession with untranslatable words. It all started when I first learned about the word backpfeifengesicht which in German means a face that needs to be slapped.

I asked my German roommate at the time of it was true and she confirmed it, the next day she presented me with a paper that she had written front and back with interesting German words including but not limited to:

Fremdschämen - basically second hand embarrassment
Wortshaftz - word treasure (this paper is my wortshaftz)
Morgenmuffel - anti morning person
Sturmfrei - that great feeling of having the house to yourself for a while
Verschlimmbessern -when you try to fix something but break it even more.

I cherish this paper and have had it for years. Every time I meet a German person I show them the page and ask them to help me say the words.

My wortshaftz has now expanded to many words from all different languages. Every one knows I go wild for new untranslatable words.

Some more great words
Saudade - a nostalgic longing for someone or something you loved and then lost
Ya'aburnee - literally ""you bury me"" loving someone so much that you want to die first so you never have to live without them
Jayus - a joke so bad its funny
Trepverter- thinking of a great comeback when it's too late to use it

Every new word makes me giddy and leaves me in awe of human creativity. I think it says so much about a culture when they have one word for such a specific situation. I'm sad that I could never possibly learn every language but my wortshaftz helps me cope."

I often lend my possessions out. I'm far too quick to say ""just pay me back when you can"" or ""use it whenever you want"" but, people take advantage of it.

I have so many friends both past and present whom I will never get money back from. I currently have a friend who keeps my favorite pair of earrings in her room because I said she could use them and she just never returned them.

I'm always the one people ask for money and things and I'm not exactly rolling in it I'm just incapable  of saying no.

All the time, I have to stop myself from offering because it's second nature to me.

This is made all the worse by the fact that I'm also the least direct person in my friend group. Every time my friends cross a line or hurt my feelings I am never able to vocalize it, I just run to my room and cry for a little.

The first is definitely unexplained. I love my dad but he isn't a good father and I wouldn't be surprised if I dreamt but convinced myself it was a memory.

The second less likely. I'm pretty sure it literally is my first actual memory. The unexplained part is that I don't understand the giant Tupperware I thought they put in my arms."

When I was maybe 3 or 4 it was the first big snow of the year and also a clear full moon. I remember  my dad waking up my older sister and I, bundling us in winter gear, and in the middle of the night we went out and played in the snow. 

One of the most beautiful and happiest memories of my life but my dad is a terrible alcoholic so even if it is true his brain is fried and he'd never be able to tell me.

Another is that I remember wearing a canary yellow sweater and sitting in a giant chair in some sort of sterile waiting room seriously my feet didn't even each the end of the cushion. Someone tells me to hold me arms out really wide and then they placed either a giant Tupperware  storage box or a baby into my arms. A few years ago I was watching family videos and one is of my little sisters birth, I'm two years old and wearing a bright yellow sweater."
