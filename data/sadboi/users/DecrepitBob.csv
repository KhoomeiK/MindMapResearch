How COVID-19  Spreads

### Person-to-person spread

The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.

* Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
* Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs."

CoronavirusAZ,fjl0v4z,t3_fdxy0s,1583437748.0,"per AZDHS, the only testing they can currently do for COVID-19 is presumptive positive testing, which first has to get approved at the county and state level health departments before proceeding. If they test presumptive positive, they have to send their sample/test to the CDC for confirmation. *However*, if they are being tested, they are treated like they are confirmed already as far as PPE and safety procedure is concerned.

Once commercial labs like Sonora/Quest start being able to test though, the number of people that can be efficiently tested could dramatically increase. This would obviously be a huge spike in numbers, which they wanted to reinforce that ""does not mean it is spreading any faster"", only that their ability to test people has grown in volume and speed.

Goes over history and progression of the virus

* **Does not recommend face mask for healthy people**
* Recommends easy access to hand sanitizer, tissues/paper towels, encouragement of getting the seasonal flu vaccine.
* Poster/announcement placement to encourage healthy practices
* Ad-hoc or as-needed solutions depending on each situation. Case by case approach. The CDC is leaning to self-isolation, social distancing, delaying the spread of the virus rather than focusing on discovering its source.
* Where to send employee for testing?  - **testing is only available in AZ Public Health Lab, approved through local and state health department levels**. Rapidly changing area once more types of testing comes available.
* Reiterates that most of their recommendations are the type they make during every major flu season.
* Cancelling Conventions/Public gatherings is a tool to limit spread of COVID19 in the community. Up to each business/entity/organizer how they handle it. They do not provide strict guidance.
* Restaurants - no specific recommendation as it is not a foodborne illness. Follow any public facing business type of guidelines.
* Work closely with local/county health department.
* County health departments are already ""doing the best they can"" with the situation already experiencing lots of phone calls with businesses and individuals.
* Refer to your business continuity plans/emergency plans, PTO policies, etc.
* **Vaccine at least a year away from being available in the general market.**
* **If community spread begins to occur, social distancing and self-isolation is likely to be a primary response**
* **They expect more cases in Arizona. Commercial labs are taking on testing so more testing capacity available in coming weeks.**
* **Family physicians/GPs will not be able to send specimen for testing due to the current approval process. Once commercial labs start assisting, Arizona might be able to start testing more people.**
* Suspected COVID19, First contact is to PCP, if symptoms are more severe, refer to Emergency department/EMS
* Incubation period of 2-14 days. Arizona is using 14 day quarantine until it is considered safe to be lowered.
* Fever, cough, flu, cold, be on the lookout for those symptoms and **exclude them from work if they are actively symptomatic.**
* Hand washing with water and soap for 20 seconds provides antiviral properties unlike hand sanitizer which is antibacterial. (not saying sanitizer is useless)
* Symptoms are similar between age ranges, but the resulting complications can be different. Consistent/similar to other upper respiratory infection complications.
* No recommendation to close a business if a patient was identified. Local county health department will investigate and provide recommendations at that time.
* **Surface can remain infected from hours up to DAYS.** Recommends routine cleaning, sanitizing, etc.
* No recommendation for the general public to wear masks.
* **AZ only can conduct presumptive positive tests and has to send to CDC for confirmation. But patients are to be treated as if they are confirmed positive.**
* Just because tests are coming back positive it does not necessarily mean the virus is spreading.
* Wet/dry cough no difference in sizing up symptoms.
* If having illnesses in workplace, maybe try excluding non-essential personnel to avoid spread.
* Keep an eye on the AZDHS website for updated info"

The various managers/employees of each section of the store use a scanner to order new boxes of merchandise which is then put in the system for whatever next delivery day if available. That scheduling is up to the warehouse who keeps inventory numbers up to date and has their own ordering to do based off of the inventory of each store. 

In a normal year, how many n95 masks do people not in construction usually buy? Very little. This means demand was low, so stores kept a basic little section or not even offer them, and their record of how many masks are purchased over X period of time is low as well, so warehouses don't keep a large supply of them on hand. Stores start selling tons of masks, the stores each individually order large amounts of them. The warehouse has to kneejerk react and likely put masks on trucks in the order they were called for rather than spreading them out evenly. The warehouse runs low/out and puts in an order for more from their source. Along with every other store around the country. Repeat for number of stores.

The manufacturers don't likely keep a huge backlog of masks in a warehouse for no reason. They probably have *some,* but in order to run lean and make enough to meet their metrics with a bit over for increased sales/business changes, stocks are more than likely not humongous to save on overhead.

bipolar,firjjhi,t3_f9brky,1582665590.0,"Yes, unfortunately. I try not to dwell on it, but it is an interesting way to try and look at the past. I was diagnosed BP2 at 29 (I am 31 now), and started treatment. I had previously been on an SSRI (Lexapro) for GAD/depression for a year or two.

So this is still all new to me. Once I got my meds in order after trying a few with little success, I was able to reflect on my behavior and mood patterns over my life. To compare the relative stability as i enter my 30s, to the traumatic childhood/teen years and obviously insane early 20s, is something to behold.

I try not to regret, but can't help but feel angst about how I really wasn't given a fair shake in life all things considered. I should have been able to get help much MUCH earlier than in my late 20s, but thats just how it went for me. Now I have lasting negative effects grounded in choices i made while hypomanic or in a depressive episode. Decisions that weren't *really* made by **me**. Hell, even my mom who has been with me the entire way through never really got to know the real me, because whatever I was putting out there up until a few years ago was all through a veil of anxiety and shame brought on by the mood swings. Personality colored by a brain wrought in torment from the constantly shifting moods and environments.

All I can do now is try and learn to practice self care, maintain treatment routines, and learn to recognize triggers and patterns leading to either hypomanic or depressive states."
DJs,fir9qzb,t3_f9fx1d,1582660188.0,You should be able to snag a DJM-750 mk1 for that price or cheaper now that the MkII has come out.  Still a world class mixer.
