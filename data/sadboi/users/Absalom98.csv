TheLastOfUs2,fp96c1y,t1_fp90w97,1588416035.0,"It isn't about the act, but how that act is perpetrated. Imagine if Joel instead shot that dude in the dick repeatedly instead of once. It would begin to feel like torture porn. The same with Ellie. Stabbing someone in the throat once versus slowly and repeatedly the way she does in the cutscene. I don't know, I see a difference in it, maybe others don't."

Visual bug - two thirds of my avatar and border are cut off at the edge of the screen. New since this update.

Gameplay bug - during seasonal match opponent played a copy of Artorius Vigo and somehow stole one of my copies of Kingslayer from my deck.

Bug - Quests and Journey progress bars not updating properly, but receiving rewards as normal it seems."

gwent,fkymg1p,t1_fkykfjo,1584651660.0,"Calm your teets, like I said, this is all off my experiences. I've faced plenty of Organic and Bleed decks and have never lost to either, and while trying them out found both could easily be outplayed. Nilfgaard has the tools to deal with almost everything, which is why I put it above Organic and Bleed. 

I don't know why you're busting me over putting NG over SY. I did no such thing. I said both were strong decks. I think Nilfgaard has more versatility, which puts it above SY in my book. You do you. 

And my current rank is 4."

Some comments did appear later on, half of which seemed to dismiss or even doubt that there were any threats at all, citing the like/dislike ratio on Proper Bird's Netflix videos. Others saying ""well duh, it's the Internet, there will always be trolls.""

wiedzmin,fcwvgkb,t1_fcut6d0,1578039293.0,"This. I will also add that Preston had a tendency to create some theories about the world, lore and history of A Song of Ice and Fire. Most of them were against the grain of what the majority of the community fanboys wanted, like R+L=J or Clegannebowl. Preston argued time and time again how those ideas are just fan service and don't serve much in terms of progressing the story. As someone who never read the novels, I thought his ideas were interesting, and definitely much more interesting than all the other Youtubers who just scoured subreddits for biggest theories and then plastered them on their thumbnails.   


I'd say originality made Preston the enemy in the eyes of the majority of the community. It was really bad from what I hear. As in, he was banned from subreddits, group discussions, and even mentioning his name in some group discussions could get you banned. Every time I mentioned him on the official subreddit, I got downvoted and blasted into oblivion."
