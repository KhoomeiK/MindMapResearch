The idea that I maybe, possibly was attracted to girls made me feel sick to be honest, cuz I just didn't want another thing to make me stand out. I carried a lot of self hatred because of this, and I felt like I would never be able to love myself. Then, I met her. (ClichÃ© right?). I was 13, and on the first day of school I noticed this girl. We had every single period together, so how could I not? I'd never had a crush on a girl in real life before, so I was VERY taken aback. We became best friends, and stayed like that for a few years. I kept my feelings hidden away, because I didn't know if she liked girls, and I want out to anyone. We didn't act platonic, though. We held hands in the halls, cuddled when we watched TV, always so close to eachother. One night, she told me she's gay, and I told her I was bi. Our friendship sort of decayed over the years, and when she was finally sick of me and I knew our relationship would never be the same, I told her I was in love. That's the last thing I've ever said to her. It's been two years. Sorry for this long story of you even read it, I just still think about her a lot unfortunately. But now, I'm pretty comfortable being bi, and I think what pushed me to feel this way sooner was the realization that I was more scared of not being able to openly be in love with this girl than be bi openly."
