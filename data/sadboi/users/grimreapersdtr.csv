Many conservative politicians think profit overrides everything else, and also think women are sub human baby machines that deserve punishment if they don’t marry and “submit and obey their owner”.

There’s a weird subset of supposedly anti-porn men who are extremely misogynistic... they often try to post on subs like this to dismiss the realities most of us women face. 

They’re often obsessed with forcing or tricking (via brainwashing: “most men aren’t porn addicts, sweetie!”) women into get married and giving birth to tons of children. They might be hyper focused on their religion. They will rant about “the breakdown of traditional values”. They’re often fixated on hating men who don’t share their race or religion. They’re obsessed with “the falling white birth rates”. They believe women are the property of men, and that they must defer to men on all issues. 

Men like this will also claim that most men out there don’t use porn, but these same men are the ones who will tell women they must “submit and obey” when they catch their husbands cheating or using porn. They will also blame women when their partners become sex addicts, or when women get assaulted. They want to peddle the false narrative that men want to paternalistically protect women, when the reality is that women should be skeptical of nearly any man who crosses their path."

Regarding the reluctance to take medications: I know Accutane has bad side effects on the liver, but I think some dermatologists have good results with low-dose accutane. I don't think it's commonly done in the US, but dermatologists in other countries seem to prescribe low-dose accutane and get good results. Many medications have bad side effects on the liver. 
I think some liver diseases manifest themselves in the form of severe skin problems, so definitely follow up with testing if your doctor thinks it's necessary. 
Genetic testing would also be a great idea if your insurance covers it. I carry a genetic mutation that automatically makes me eligible to have breast MRIs without going through hoops of fire. It might shorten the length of time it takes for you to get to the bottom of this problem-- and will also save you money in the long run.  
I went through years of attempting to self treat with over the counter remedies and products and wasted so much money. Some of us simply can't treat our acne with the kinds of everyday treatments that work for other people.  

Another side note: ask family and extended family about their medical histories if possible... even distant relatives or deceased relatives. (If you happen to be adopted, disregard this). I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my mid 20s. Part of the reason I was diagnosed was because I insisted that my PCP test me for it after I gained a lot of weight rather quickly after having mono, and my father also had it. At 25 I didn't show up as officially hypothyroid. At 27 I was confirmed hypothyroid. Thyroid conditions run in my family. If you tell your doctors about medical conditions in your family, it might help them narrow down what the underlying issue is. Sometimes insurance requires some kind of family history to justify covering/approving certain diagnostic tests. I know you're not from the US, but maybe the medical doctors in your country need to follow a protocol before ordering diagnostic tests."
acne,fr52g6c,t1_fr4zji6,1589901308.0,"I see. I would definitely contact your PCP and get a general check up, let alone contact a dermatologist. I doubt any medical doctor worth his or her degree would blow your concerns off, because it looks extremely painful. I wouldn't be shocked if Accutane were suggested for you, particularly since you had no good luck with hormonal birth control. Honestly, I had fewer bad side effects with Accutane than I did with tetracycline or any antibiotics. Not everyone is the same, though.  

In general, I would recommend that anyone who has severe acne should try to obtain copies of their own medical records from their PCPs, old dermatologists, gynecologists. If that's not possible, at least document somewhere all of the medications and regimens you've tried in the past. Being able to prove to a dermatologist that you've tried every other treatment before will probably help him or her decide the best route of treatment more quickly. 

Ramble: 

Honestly, the older I get the more I think acne is part of a complicated spectrum of autoimmune disorders, or an autoimmune disorder in itself... and I wouldn't be surprised if acne was the first sign of a long term adult medical condition during a person's lifetime. No one can convince me that when my skin is breaking out severely that there is nothing wrong going on with my body internally. The skin is the largest organ of the body. 
 
Unfortunately, since most people who develop severe acne are in their teens, medical doctors blow it off as ""just acne"".    

While some people grow out of it, other people like myself and two of my siblings have treatment resistant acne. I've been on Accutane 3 times (mostly because my acne was resistant to all treatments), my brother was on it twice. My sister was on it once but stopped due to side effects. We all still experience acne while around 40 years old and older. Luckily mine at it's worst is not as extreme as many people on this sub, it's still relentless and resists most common forms of prescription treatment.   

I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in my mid 20s, and tons of autoimmune disorders including lupus, psoriasis, and diabetes run in my family.  

In the past year alone, I've been treated for acne, folliculitis, perioral dermatitis AND seborrheic dermatitis! I was treated by a regular dermatologist and also via dermatology visits using the MD live app. The app was really convenient, because I could send the doctor photos of my problem at the height of severity. Sometimes my skin will mystically clear up right before a regular in-office derm visit. Thankfully my insurance covered it.

It's like my immune system won't stop attacking my own skin and whatever normal flora and fauna seems to be growing on it. I'm not the only one with this problem. I know problems like psoriasis have been linked to rheumatoid arthritis. I wish the medical community would get at the bottom of treatment resistant acne."

GenderCritical,fr1kpmq,t1_fqv5l8d,1589821403.0,"Exactly. They expect a body type that is not normally seen in women as a group. 
I’m on the thin side, and definitely can’t imagine myself with DDD cups and a large behind- you can’t have 10-15% body fat as a woman and have large breasts and buttocks."

I’ve noticed that many perpetually underemployed men see blue collar manual labor as “beneath” them.  
I honestly wish I could make more money operating a fork lift or doing a job with my hands, since they often pay more money and require less face-to- face customer service ass kissing... but at my size, gender and age, I know I’d be denied moat jobs like that."
GenderCritical,fr1j1on,t1_fqxnx0r,1589820584.0,"I agree. 
I can’t see things getting better, particularly with the increasing tendency of wealth to be amassed by a few people. Money = power, and it seems increasingly hard for women to get jobs that pay living wages. Earning a living wage prevents women from being trapped with abusive partners/family. I swear, financial constraints always seem to the the top reason women put up with abuse.  

The increasing acceptance of violent pornography will also ensure that young men and girls will grow up thinking sexual violence towards women is the norm. We’ve been dehumanized a great deal since the proliferation of easily accessible internet porn. I swear, during the internet boom of the 90s/00s, it was as if the rise of blatant open misogyny was meteoric. 

The intrusion of technology into our daily lives will also force us to confront constant misogyny- because the bulk of the IT industry and it’s big wigs are hardcore misogynists. I can’t downplay enough how frightening this reality is."

PornFreeRelationships,fr1h19t,t3_glwdjz,1589819584.0,"I think modern day beauty standards are straight-up mimicking pornography.  

I'm almost 40, BTW, so I vaguely remember the pre-internet-porn-era. It's not that makeup, long hair, nails, breast implants, etc weren't a part of ""regular beauty culture"", but the kind of cartoonish extreme makeup and beauty/cosmetic treatment trends weren't as common back then. For example, people didn't inflate their lips to obvious-fake proportions. That trend came out of men's porn-related fetish for ""big d*ck sucking lips"".  

Heavy makeup wasn't really common for women on an everyday basis unless they were older and/or had skin problems. For example, when I was in my teens/20s, most women my age only wore maybe lipstick, mascara. Some wore blush. The ones who wore foundation normally did so to hide acne. Now, it seems that full eye makeup, contour, fully drawn in eyebrows, primer, foundation, concealer, lipstick with lipliner, etc, is ""the thing"". Just seems like overkill. The amount of money spent on these kind of beauty regimens have to be mind-boggling. 

If you ever watch popular TV shows from the 1980s and 1990s, or see photographs of famous actresses from that era, it's unbelievable how modestly dressed most women characters/actresses were with the exception of a few."
PornFreeRelationships,fr1fj3o,t3_gm1q0j,1589818835.0,"YES. I often think guys who go overboard on talking about their porn addiction, talking about how hot other women are, etc., in front of their partners are attempting to NEG their partners. They want to break their girlfriends/wives down so they feel compelled to stay in the relationship ""because I'm not attractive enough for any other man to want because my SO says I'm not as hot as XYZ""."
