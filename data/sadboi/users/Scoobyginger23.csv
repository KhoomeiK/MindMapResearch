Anxiety,fqwthwo,t3_gl6u7j,1589717087.0,Unfortunately I’ve been a very heavy drinker on/off for most my teens and early twenties and have massively embarrassed myself on a grand scale many times. I have to try my best to let it go because thinking about the past or potential future fuck ups just fuels my anxiety and self loathing which makes me crave alcohol and the short term numbness and oblivion even more. (Even though a lot of my most embarrassing moments were caused by alcohol in the first place!)
benzorecovery,fpzuj6x,t1_fpgocva,1589023868.0,"I like this “got to pay the piper” phrase, it reminds me to stay sober from both alcohol and Xanax which I have abused in the past. You’re right it is just like a loan shark, It will make you pay back worse and more in the long run so it’s best not to even start if you can help it."
benzorecovery,fpzrgs3,t3_gfwu5d,1589022405.0,"Personally no, I was on them everyday for nearly four months (10 mg a day for last 6 weeks) and coming off cold turkey was hell. I caved after day three of the horrific mental and physical symptoms and started back on 6mg a day for a week and slowly tapered down which was much more manageable."
Drugs,fpov9e8,t1_fpof250,1588791248.0,"Yes I’m fully aware I’m a complete idiot, thought wow this is amazing for my anxiety but I will be careful and only take it on very rare occasions or situations where my anxiety would be particularly severe. And yes they worked like a dream but fast forward to like a year later after just being on them occasionally and I’m in this position (been on and off them semi heavily for like 6months) I called my doctor and he gave me a big lecture and has prescribed me a lower dosage which my mum is in charge of prescribing out over the next ten days as a responsible adult for me which is kind of humiliating as I’m 25 and I’m lockdown With them but it’s probably good they are fully aware of the whole extent now and are working on getting help after the taper (drug meetings and good therapy for the mental health issues I had which made me think these pills were a good idea in the first place) and yes you’re right coming off them so steeply is the most horrible I’ve ever felt both physically and mentally. It’s hell"

TwoXSex,fo2lmqy,t3_g36i2h,1587467010.0,Yes! Because in real life most women I’ve talked to are no where near that extreme side of the scale but it seems twitter brings all the freakiness out. Not that it’s wrong to like sex that rough if they genuinely enjoy it but I don’t know how many actually do.
TwoXSex,fo2j6rj,t1_fnr5ogn,1587464452.0,No but I just feel like that’s what I have to say or I come across too much as a delicate flower who is behind the times. I see so many women (especially on twitter) who are just like “want to be chocked and spanked hard rn” or even calling guys “daddy” which tbh just freaks me out and Would make me think of my father. Idk if that’s what these girls really want (not judging) but I feel twitter is very different from real life and people will say things just for shock value or attention.
TwoXSex,fnqf4se,t3_g36i2h,1587163383.0,"Yes, I’m at that age where all the guys around my age grew up watching porn on their phones or laptops and it has influenced our generation greatly. Not that porn wasn’t available in other generations but not as widespread and I think it has definitely evolved and got rougher over the years. Guys I’ve been with will go into full on pounding jackhammer with very little foreplay and think this makes me feel good or Will roughly grab me by the hair and neck and anal is also a lot more expected now and grabbing your head and pounding your throat. Again I’m not a prude and sometimes enjoy rougher sex but again foreplay and taking it slow at first is very important. Have just felt like a rag doll sometimes"
Anxiety,fnqe4xf,t3_g2yamz,1587162825.0,"My social anxiety got so bad around the age of 13 (i was just more in the shy category before then) i felt sick to my stomach with anxiety getting up everyday and going to school and completely drained and depressed by the end of it. I had a group of close friends I was close with and had moments of happiness luckily but unfortunately by age 15/16 I started abusing alcohol and that spiralled very quickly as I thought it was some miracle cure for my social anxiety And I used to have to do some shots in the toilets and taking breath mints before going into certain classes as I felt I was going to pass out with panic if I didn’t. At first I kept it under control and Well hidden but obviously it got worse and pushed the few people I did have away and my grades were failing because I was also deeply depressed and didn’t care about anything anymore. This was ten years ago and mental health wasn’t as talked about and was more taboo. I knew something was deeply wrong with me but couldn’t put it into words and family, teachers and peers couldn’t understand why I couldn’t just snap out of it. Luckily my mum finally realised I wasn’t just being a moody, rebellious or lazy teen and got me some help at 17. I’m 25 now and still have bad days but am a lot better at coping and it helps that so many others understand mental illness a lot better and it’s not something you need to cover up and be ashamed of."

All the damage she could have done already (she gets public transport there and back) the lockdown is slightly more relaxed here in UK but 85% of people are complying and not being total dicks. The numbers have gone down slightly but we are still very much in the danger zone and she’s being so stupid and finding it really hard not to slap her. Just because it’s unlikely she will die from it doesn’t mean she isn’t spreading it to other poor people who will suffer a horrendous illness or even death."

stopdrinking,flxl0ul,t1_fj6uwpk,1585584957.0,"Thanks you too, I try but the truth is I have to really really concentrate and put all my willpower into not going and having another drink once I’ve had one but I will struggle and do it occasionally to keep up appearances and be like “see! I can drink like the rest of you” but at home alone sometimes with no one judging I will drink until blackout because that’s what my stupid brain wants to do. A lot of people need to understand that addiction usually starts from a place of pain and self medicating and getting hooked is a side effect from that pain. We need to find the root problem"

Just need to watch I’m not going to spiral down and down and then by June I’m drinking every other day again. WHY does my brain trick me into thinking I can drink responsibly just because occasionally (when I concentrate really hard I can have two drinks and go home) and even then the chances are 85% it’s going to end up with me crying hysterically on the floor, trying to smash the place up or fight someone.

depression,fhvdr4k,t1_fhv9c8t,1581896241.0,I do this too! During periods I’ve had abstaining from alcohol/pills I will just eat and eat and eat to distract myself. Particularly sugary stuff when I’ve come off the booze. God I’m all kinds of fucked up! There always has to be another unhealthy coping mechanism that pops up to replace old ones. Or when I was getting overweight I stopped eating and went back to pills again.

I drink a fair amount for my anxiety (the anxiety came long before the drinking so it’s not that, although I agree the drinking in the long run makes it worse) and have humiliated myself so many times which makes the self loathing worse. I cant function socially without a couple drinks but now the drinking has progressed and I don’t know when to stop which leads to me humiliating myself or putting myself in danger (have also been sexually assaulted whilst hammered many times) I hate my life with or without alcohol and don’t see a way forward."
