GaySoundsShitposts,fpqsewn,t3_g9ytxb,1588830870.0,"I’m not sure if my view is helpful, but I feel like if I was definitely cis and straight, and there was a heaven but queer people aren’t allowed in, that’s a heaven that I wouldn’t want to be a part of. I feel like a heaven without camp gay old men playing the piano and singing to me, trans YouTube makeup artists teaching me how to do my liner and trans boys bro-ing down at the end of every song wouldn’t be heaven - it would just be Utah. And Utah doesn’t really cut it for me to be heaven.

Heaven and hell are interesting because they’re actually from the New Testament and not the old one, there is no hell in the Torah. There are good deeds and sins yes, but no hell. No eternal damnation. I actually find most of the Jewish views on the afterlife to be quite soothing, despite no longer practicing. Some reform Jews believe not in an afterlife like heaven, but that our spirit lives on forever through those close to us, that we are like a tree and we plant little seeds of ourselves in others throughout our lives and those seeds bloom into trees which create more seeds. I like that one!"
guitarlessons,fpf62yk,t3_gctzb7,1588562669.0,"Doing good for 5 months! There's a few things you can have a geeze at that should help - first is tuning the guitar up before you start, and try to remember to tune the guitar regularly throughout the practice session itself because when you're starting out, the difference between the dissonance of a ""jazzy"" chord and the guitar being a bit out of tune can be hard to discern, but if you purposefully tune the instrument regularly throughout your sessions, you actually train your ears to hear if you're out of tune.

Next one is also about intonation. You want to make sure your fingers are as close as possible to the frets, basically right underneath them without being on top of them. This has a lot of different benefits, most notably having the notes more in tune but it also is less likely to cause string buzz, requires less physical effort and lets the notes sustain longer. Be persistent with this when playing single note lines, but in chords, just try to get as close as possible. Some chords you just can't get right under the frets, but you shouldn't find this too difficult with a bit of work on those chords.

One thing my teacher got me to do to loosen up my shoulders when playing was to practice exercises whilst walking around the room with the guitar on, maintaining tense shoulders is quite difficult whilst doing this for some reason that I do not understand haha

In terms of tone, that shit is elusive as hell and even John Mayer is still trying to figure out how to better sound like Hendrix. When I wanna sound like Mayer, I generally crank my Strat in 2nd or 4th position to get that sweet Strat spank. It could be worth investing some time into using compression as well - whilst Jimi didn't have compressor pedals, he did have big old valve amps running hot as hell, which gives a natural warmth and compression.

Last thing is learn the lyrics. What is the song about? What is the emotion of the song, is there a story etc. The way Jimi played told a story, rich in detail and nuance. You know what little wing is about before the lyrics even come in. This part takes time, so be patient. Keep a focus on it of course, but be patient with connecting that emotion to your hands. You’re coming along well!"
BPD,fp1crwa,t3_gaoaxf,1588231240.0,"I think I understand the point you're making, I'm not entirely sure I agree with the way it's said but I think I do. I think you just mean that BPD is not justification for hurting others and shouldn't be used as an excuse to consciously keep on doing it, which I definitely agree with. However, hurting other people before we're aware of this or during a relapse, whilst not a specific symptom, can very easily be explained by almost all of the diagnostic criteria - fear of abandonment, unstable relationships, impulsive behaviour, anger that is difficult to control and emotional dysregulation can all lead to hurting others.

I'm more writing this for my own sake cause ya boy has had a history of hurting other people, and I'm full of guilt over it which is appropriate, but I didn't realise at the time that these things were just maladaptive coping mechanisms to deal with fear of abandonment. I did what seemed like the only possible thing to do at the time to feel safe. I definitely hurt those people in that way because of bpd, to try and soothe myself - but bpd ain't a separate entity from myself that excuses the behaviour. It can explain, but not excuse.

Gotta do that dialectical shit. It is both good and bad, understandable and not acceptable. Just gotta be present and be better, be kind to our past selves idk lmao"
changemyview,fp11923,t3_gaicru,1588221739.0,"Look, I'm not exactly an academic expert on this, but I'm not exactly sure ""gender theory"" is either what you're criticising, or in fact something that can be criticized in this way as gender theory isn't like a scientific theory that has a sense of...I don't know the word, unification? Gender theory is an umbrella term more like music theory - there is a general concept you are studying but the concept is incredibly broad and there isn't a whole heap of consensus among theorists.

In this way, gender theory doesn't have a sole focus nor any core goals. A men's rights activist is technically just as much of a gender theorist as Judith Butler, and the conservative old man who doesn't believe women should be in the army because they are weak and too feminine is as much a gender theorist as you as a woman enlisted in the army are.

I think your problem may just be with the adjectives ""feminine"" and ""masculine,"" am I right? IIRC, this is called ""gender performativity,"" which may be what you actually have a gripe with. In order to study gender in this way, you have to acknowledge that gender exists and that there are certain behaviours and attributes (performances/roles) that are expected of people of different genders. In a binary view of gender, the word  used to describe qualities pertaining specifically to men is ""masculine"", and to women it is ""feminine."" We can observe that there are certain norms and roles associated with gender without being sexist. It starts becoming sexist when biology comes into play.

A huge amount of study has been into the fact that gender norms as we know them do not exist in a vacuum - they are influenced by and decided upon by the culture in which they exist. Gender norms are inherently sexist because of this - nobody really knows what  gender norms would look like in a vacuum, and as such, labelling anything as being masculine or feminine is going to have to work off of these flawed ideas. There is very little consensus over whether certain gender differences are biological or environmental and there will never be definitive proof one way or the other.

I'm a cis guy who is skinny, likes wearing makeup, likes wearing heels, kisses boys on occasion, and I'm very open emotionally. Only one of these things defines my gender as male, and that is that I identify with it. Each other thing that I described would be currently viewed as feminine, but there has been a time and place where all of these aspects were considered masculine qualities that women were incapable of or not allowed/encouraged to hold. 

Gender norms are bullshit. Your (and my) problem is with shitty gender roles and heteronormativity, not whatever you mean by ""gender theory."""
guitarlessons,foy90bf,t1_foy65i7,1588167976.0,"Definitely check out the book pumping nylon by Scott Tennant - mostly just for the diagrams and explanations of technique! The book has an insanely steep learning curve though so I don't recommend as a text to work through as a whole, but he explains technical aspects of both hands really clearly in layman's terms and some of the basic exercises like finger walking are great for independence! 

I was self taught initially on classical and I used two of the Hal Leonard books which I found amazing. I wasn't super interested in classical music, but the exercises in those books were challenging and I started seeing results real quick.

The Berklee method is also amazing if you're teaching yourself but it's mostly plectrum focused iirc, that's great foundational stuff for all contemporary styles and the pieces in it just sound really nice! I think that's William Leavitt"
guitarlessons,foxeerd,t3_g9x70z,1588141476.0,"Sounds like you've got some music in you! What others have said about the ring finger is great, I'd suggest having a look at your posture, specifically where your right arm is. 

It looks like you're coming from all the way around the bottom of the guitar to get to the strings, and I'm not sure if you've noticed but it looks like your index finger and thumb are sometimes getting caught on each other. It also makes more parts of your arm work to generate the notes, when you actually want the majority of tone production coming from the fingers for a piece that's delicate like this. 

First off, get set up in front of a mirror. Try getting your forearm closer to a 45' angle instead of parallel with the strings, and rest your thumb on the low E string as if it were about to play the string (this is called planting) so that your thumb is about 2 inches past the rose (the patterned bit around the soundhole) towards the neck, and then letting your wrist and fingers hang loose. 

There's a few things that you should notice here - first of all, your index finger on the right hand should be pretty much bang on where the rose is, which is where you want to finger pick to get the best balance between round and bassy with clear and defined. The next thing to notice is that your knuckles should be reasonably parallel with the strings - not necessarily perfectly parallel, but just in the general area (this is slightly variable for different people). The third thing to notice is that if you plant your 3 fingers on the first 3 strings with index on G, middle on B and ring on E and look straight down at your fingers, each of them should have their own space to move on the strings where they won't run into each other.

Describing how to fix this is if it doesn't work is esoteric and doable, but I don't know how to word  it without being able to give you a physical demonstration. If it's legal/safe where you are, I'd recommend seeing someone with their head around classical stuff for a few lessons just to get an understanding of how you can hold and play fingerstyle stuff - you don't need to embrace the technique - I did years of classical training which I almost never use explicitly except when I need it, but I still use all the same principles in my fingerstyle, just adapted for modern repertoire.

Watch some videos of some of the great finger pickers, like Joe Pass, Martin Taylor, Tommy Emmanuel, Chet Atkins, John Williams and Andre Segovia. All monsters of technique and expression who all seek to coax very different things from the guitar, and all have differences in technique yes, but you'll find more similarities than you would think!"

guitarrepair,fo1b1vm,t3_g4wcid,1587429437.0,"Look, I don't know how your dad would react so this may not be appropriate in your situation, but it may be worth talking to him about it before getting it fixed if he actually wants it to be fixed - some people pay an awful lot of money for guitars that have been artificially reliced cause they feel it gives the guitar character, so he may not be that mad! 

I had something similar happen with one of my dad's guitars, though not as bad as that chip but also worse cause it was a Gibson custom shop - I was apologetic and offered to pay to repair the finish, and he said that if it was that precious to him, he wouldn't have loaned it to me (which was a bit of a dig but it was also very true and he was allowed that). He may be chill!

Or if your dad is quite aggressive and you're genuinely worried, ignore this anecdotal advice. Either way, if you are prepared to get it repaired, I would still take it to him before you do for a few reasons - he may not want it fixed and likes it, he may have a luthier that he trusts that he wants to do it, and it isn't actually your guitar to decide what to do with it. If it's precious enough to him to ""kill you"" for damaging it, it'll be precious enough to kill you for repairing it if the repair isn't done the way he'd have wanted with the added element of a lie.

I would make an appointment to take it in to a good luthier, then tell your dad what happened and show him, telling him you've made the appointment and are prepared to repair it, and if he doesn't want it repaired then you can just get the guitar serviced as an apology."

Guitar,fnr7rix,t1_fnogqz8,1587181399.0,"I don't really agree with the premise that simply because you learned how to do something specific more recently than I did means that you empathise more effectively with someone learning that thing than someone who learned it 20 years ago - unless that person hasn't really progressed that much further or lacks a lot of self awareness in their own development. Most of those fundamental techniques are continually built on, challenged and refined again. 

Do I vividly remember in great detail struggling to switch from E to A? Not in great detail, but I do vaguely remember struggling and cycling back and forth between the two chords for hours until I felt they were clean. Then I learned chords in inversions and found ways of learning new chords more quickly and efficiently so I could utilise them more quickly. Then harmonizing scales in 7th chords and their inversions, and I spent a lot of time trying to visualise patterns and then analysing how different fingers moved between chords to try and get as fluid sounding changes as Joe Pass or Wes Montgomery gets. 

So again, do I vividly remember struggling switching from A to E? Not as well as you, but I've spent the last 15 years actively refining that same fundamental technique under various teachers and with a lot of personal study to develop systems to minimise that struggle. I still struggle, just not with A and E anymore.

Not that your experience isn't valuable, a lot of people with questions like these want advice from people they can empathize more with. 

I wholeheartedly agree people saying ""just practice more"" is infuriating, especially talking about barre chords and development of strength/endurance since there are actually ways of developing good technique that requires less physical exertion and less practice time. I imagine these are the same ""experts"" who say learning modes is useless in playing jazz cause it's all just a major scale anyway, or reading music isn't required to be a professional cause Jimi Hendrix didn't read. These are not experts, at least not in pedagogy. These ""experts"" make it harder for students to believe teachers can empathize with them, which sucks, but that's internet music forums for you I guess.

I think it's important that beginners understand that forums like these are not reliable places to get definitive answers or pertinent advice from, as dumbass anti intellectual weekend warriors are just gonna tell you to practice more and just do what feels right. If there's a certain standard that you want to reach, you will most likely need to seek out professional guidance, whether in lessons with a teacher or instructional materials by established players/teachers, you can't rely on these forums cause you're gonna get stuck with useless ""expert"" opinions."
Guitar,fnr22nn,t3_g2zwbc,1587177435.0,"Man, it's written in a pretty dicky way but in a way, I do agree. It's difficult to phrase this in a good way, but I think most players don't understand how physically difficult playing an instrument actually is if you want to achieve a level of virtuosity in any aspect of your playing - I use virtuosity to describe any technique, not just speed/difficulty - so somebody like BB King is as rightfully a virtuoso as Steve Vai. 

There are certain physical aspects of playing that only experts are reputable sources on, and that hobbyists just have not put the legwork in to comment on . Good technique is a bit like any other physical science in that you really only should be consuming information from experts.

But the problem becomes apparent when we ask *who* is an expert and who is allowed to call themselves one. I don't really like the idea of guitar teachers requiring qualifications, as a piece of paper is significantly easier to get than pulling good tone, and so many greats don't have high school diplomas, let alone expensive university qualifications.

And what things can non experts comment on? I've seen people ask for advice on switching from one chord to another quickly, and there's rarely a bad answer to this question and very little in the way of consequences to an answer that isn't the most effective, cause truth be told it's all just repetition till you get muscle memory in one way or another. But I've also seen people post questions about using modes effectively and I'd say less than 10% of responses I've seen are accurate or remotely useful and often push the commenter's own ideology on these, which will result in the student learning shit the wrong way and not being able to use it.

I guess the moral is if you just want to be a hobbyist and have a bit of fun, post in online forums and enjoy yourself. If you want to get more serious about the instrument and pursue it professionally or at a tertiary level, find a reputable teacher who teaches what you want to learn. Not some weekend warrior who you ask if it's worth learning to read music and tells you Jimi Hendrix didn't know how, and then wonders why you got fired from your first session job cause you couldn't read a simple melody in D major and can't get any jazz gigs cause you don't know how to spell chords on the fly."
bluesguitarist,fjuzp4s,t3_feyarr,1583621759.0,Playing is sick man! Not related to your guitar playing but it might be worth trying out that tuning down a tone (or potentially more) to fit with your vocal range a bit better - could let you belt that high bit in your chest voice! Sounds great though 😊
Guitar_Theory,f0p90h2,t1_f0p6a7r,1568829777.0,"The strokes also love using a pedal point with one of the guitars or the bass to create extra colour as well - a pedal here meaning like a note that hangs on while the chord changes around it.

Examples with the strokes using that would be in Last Nite where one guitar is fanging a C in octaves over a progression going F - G and the note C is a MAJOR clash over a G chord but somehow it works? 

And not exactly a pedal but in someday in the 2nd and 3rd bar the guitar plays the same chord (D-F#-C# to D-F#B) over changing bass notes which creates really nice colours! It's a severe overanalysis but it kinda creates this progression:
|| A Aadd9 | Bm9 Bm | Dmaj7 D6 | Aadd9 A ||

So that you can kind of see colour coming in and out of the melody from that"
Guitar_Theory,f0p804p,t3_d5xila,1568829163.0,"Melodic riffs usually imply a chord progression of some kind, in the case of ""Someday"" the riffs are actually chords, but the ""melody"" is the highest note (aka voice) in the chord - melodic riffs that use chords will generally have the melody in the highest or lowest voice - this isn't a general rule but there's a few reasons if you're looking to write your own melodic riffs with chords to follow this logic:

1) The top voice generally cuts through the most clearly

2) It's the easiest note technique wise to add additional emphasis too as well if you want the melody to sit above the chord.

In someday the theory is relatively simple I think - the verse melody goes in a pretty nice arc shape , creates a bit of tension at the start and resolves it at the end. The chorus I'm pretty sure is just playing notes directly from the chord, which means even though it starts a bit busy it stays out of the vocals way!

My fave part of the strokes is definitely the way they arrange the guitars and bass, they really use rhythms interlapping over each other to create a groove that is a hook in and of itself! The Kooks are really good at that sort of shit too so are definitely worth a geeze!

Does that answer your question?"
