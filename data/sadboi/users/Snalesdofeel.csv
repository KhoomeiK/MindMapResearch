In you're case there is no danger, there is no predator chasing you ( im gonna asume ), so what do you really fear? The attack itself, you treat the panic attack is if it were a predator. 

So instead of facing down a predator you have to face down the attack itself. You can't stop it consciously, it reacts to what you believe about it, and right now you believe that it is dangerous. 

You have to face the attack with as little fear towards it as possible, over and over and over again. It cant survive unless you react to it in fear.

Anxiety,fgnzuz0,t3_ezijnq,1580956569.0,"The what if thoughts come because of your current panic state. They come as an attempt to figure out why you are in this state, since you cant find or see the reason yourself. 

Usually there would be an immediate reason, like someone threatening you, chasing you, illness etc. You happened to get into this state for whatever reason and your body treats it AS IF it's actually happening. 

The symptoms of this panic state as you mention: feeling sick and dizzy, works to reinforce that something is wrong."
Anxiety,fgnyefi,t3_ezj7kb,1580955629.0,"Use this tiredness to revolt against what is oppressing you.

You really have to get to a point where you have simply had enough. Refuse to go into the stories your mind create, refuse reacting to the sensations it gives you. 

Stuff that hasn't happened, and will most likely never happen. Its made up stories in an attempt to save you from your current fight/flight state. Insanity."
Anxiety,fgnxlmn,t3_ezjmmd,1580955119.0,"It's only there because you focus in on it. 

The belief you have about it, that it might be a threat to you, is it's fuel to keep going.

Anxiety causes such symptoms you mention and that is almost the basis for all anxiety, to fear the tension it causes because were unable to release it.

What's supposed to protect us from ACTUAL dangers becomes what we fear the most."
Anxiety,fgnwsvr,t3_ezklba,1580954610.0,"All you're mind is waiting for you to do is stop reacting anxiously to whatever is presents to you.

It's a test, if you continue reacting in fear it can't stop racing. It's here to protect you, and you clearly view what you hear and feel as if its a threat to you."
Anxiety,fg8adb5,t3_exhaha,1580613824.0,"It's all in what you believe about what you feel. You're brain pummels you with ideas in an attempt to solve it, and sees how you react to it. Made up threats gets the same treatment as real ones when you react like you do, there is no difference.

If you're out of ideas, what take its place is you're symptoms. Nausea and spinning are such classic symptoms of stress, but if you fear it, try to make it go away, then it just lingers and elevates the already existing symptoms."

Anxiety,ffyp6xe,t3_evy0u2,1580351774.0,"It's unresolved feelings resurfacing. Every time you react with ""this might be a heart attack"" you condition yourself to fear the feeling, when in reality its just that, a feeling. 

Resolving it as opposed to reacting in fear is the solution, but that entails going through the emotions and feeling them at they're peak. If you are afraid it's gonna kill you, then you will have to let it ""kill"" you."
Anxiety,ffynnbe,t3_evwp9z,1580350723.0,"You are running in circles. You are worried about this constant state of alert wich ironically keeps it alive.

While you desperately try to find the cause for this state, you create more distress, because there is no cause.

You will begin to feel fine when you don't search for a cause, when you dont obsess over it, fight it, try to run from it. When you can stand and face these thoughts,feelings without reacting to them.

It's a paper tiger, but you view it AS IF it were a sign of danger, and so it wont stop."
Tekken,ffqj9eu,t1_ffqdyjt,1580136129.0,"It's not about the damage, its about stealing turns all the time. Idk how + it is on block, but it gives momentum. Maybe down here in orange ranks life is different."

Anxiety,ff74wyt,t3_erzdr0,1579641191.0,"You think something is wrong with you, but nothing is. Whats wrong here is that the panic you feel now, is supposed to be there when something is ACTUALLY wrong with you - it just got turned on without any reason. Atleast the reason for it is long gone now, but you still treat what you feel as if its still there.

Its not about blood pressure, its not about your heart, its not about anything dangerous you could think off - its about you beeing in fight/flight. 

Your brain tests you with everything because it wants to solve as to why you are in this state, but as we know, there is no reason for it. It's only you fearing what you feel, thus keeping it alive."
Anxiety,fencdkg,t1_fems1se,1579281669.0,"It wants to know if what you feel pose a threat or anything significant too you. Since you react the way you do towards what you feel, you kind of tell it that yes, this is of significance.

If you want to it to go away, if you hide from it, if you fear it - you then treat it as if it's some actual thing when it's not. If you don't react to it, accept it with open arms, it has no means to survive and will thus subside."
Anxiety,fem1yb1,t3_epm7i7,1579237110.0,"You do have to face your fears, wich at the moment you are very unwilling to do.

Anxiety,fejjt9b,t3_epi3wc,1579177213.0,"""it's like my anxiety is this whole separate entity who sits and thinks of new ways of f\*ing with me""  - is very much profound.

Anxiety,feh13b8,t1_feh0970,1579106931.0,Yeah i guess crude is an understatement. Only in retrospect will you see that it was a desperate attempt to save you from you're fears.
Anxiety,fegyyxb,t3_ep45y6,1579105643.0,"You're brain is torturing you as a crude way of protecting you.

Whenever you react in fear, discontent to the thoughts and sensations you have, you tell your brain that this is indeed something important and a possible threat to you. And so the loop keeps going.

""All day every day my anxiety is horrible"" - this translates to your brain as: Im under threat, im under threat.

Ironically whats supposed to protect you, is what you are afraid of."

Anxiety,fefveeh,t1_fefua7e,1579066443.0,"But it is, it was for those who taught me this and me after them. It set us free, and proved that anxiety is us, its how we react to the symptoms of prolonged stress, repressed emotions.

I thought i was gonna die, i thought i had every illness, i overthought, i freaked out - it was the recipe for keeping me in this panic state for decades. When I stopped fighting, resisiting and letting the panic attack come with 0 resistance it never came back.

You get close to panic attacks because you react to the panic in fear thus giving it momentum and the result would be a panic attack. Its not a thing like a monster, or an illness."
Anxiety,fefta5t,t1_fefq1co,1579064531.0,"You say you don't hold back but you do, because if you were non reactive to panic/panic attacks, you couldn't have them."
Anxiety,fefnmp8,t1_fefm8o7,1579060278.0,"What is a panic attack? It is fear, it is you feeling something and fearing it - that is unless you have something specific you can point at that could be the reason, like a predator chasing you, like an illness. It comes and goes because you still fear it, you still hold it back because if you let totally go the feelings would wash over you and you would be done with it - since this is not a predator, not an illness, just emotions."
Anxiety,fefl8xk,t3_eovn82,1579058716.0,"Anxiety might have come back because it were never truly resolved. What i mean is that you didn't fully experience all the emotions associated with it, and let them go.

They remain in the body like a bad memory, and small triggers are enough to set them off. 

It might sound counterintuitive, but when you get a panic attack, you want it to come, you want it do unleash everything it has on you so you can finaly let go of it."
Anxiety,fefkbnb,t3_eow6nc,1579058143.0,"The secret to not having panic attacks is to have a full panic attack while standing your ground.

It can't hurt you no matter what - it is built up tension wanting to get release, but can't since you believe the panic attack is a sign of something more than what i mentioned here.

A panic attack IS beeing afraid of having a panic attack, since the attack itself has nothing to do with any real life event."
Anxiety,fe6j0dr,t1_fe6hcvz,1578892442.0,"You have to face what you fear, the emotions fueling the health anxiety obsession.

You have to go through them so you can show your brain that what you feel is in fact only intense emotions, and not the sign of lymp node cancer."
Anxiety,fe6h0v1,t3_enybhl,1578890640.0,"Take your life back by confronting the real culprit, anxiety.

If you didn't worry about lymph nodes or hair, you would quickly replace these fears with something else.

It all stems from the humming anxiety in the background, you are deep in fight/flight and convinced you have something is wrong with you. But you don't, what you have is a tense nervous system acting as if you had something wrong with you."
Anxiety,fdflutw,t3_el1clq,1578364707.0,"Anxiety do bring on an endless array of symptoms, often intense as can be, depending.

This one thought ""could it be something else than anxiety"" is enough to keep it going for as long as you think this way, and to intesify it.

This is what its all about: you are in fight/flight and you have symptoms because of it. You search for a reason, but none can be found, you are simply in fight/flight."
