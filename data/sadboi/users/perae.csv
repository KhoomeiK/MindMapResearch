TeamSolomid,fqf8gd8,t3_gigxz2,1589320467.0,"It's actually kind of insane to look at this thread and see the general 180 this subreddit has taken after a single statement from Regi. 

Not even 24 hours ago, this subreddit was filled with threads about how bad the situation is, and how the conflict of interest was actually proven to be very real in front of our eyes. You had a multitude of people arguing that what thoorin and monte were saying actually had some merit. The general consensus was very clearly that this was a massive fuck up, and that something needs to happen.

Then Regi makes a statement where, in my opinion, he made two points that caused this whole subreddit to switch it's mind. 

Point #1 Regi makes a point that Leena does not take part in trades. There is a very very very large amount of evidence in terms of statements and screenshots that goes very much against this. Even the very short bit of information everyone heard from the phone call goes agaist this. Additionally, Leena herself has stated that she is very much involved in the process. And I am sure that within the next 24 hours even more evidence that suggests that leena is part of the roster building process will surface. 

Point #2. Sexism. There is not much to say about this. It is very unfortunate that people are going down that route, and ultimately there is not much you or I can do about it. I agree with Regi, and I think its sad whats happening, and I really wish that it wasnt the case. But at the same time it does not change anything that happened. Even Regi himself said as much.

In my opinion Leena should not have anything to do with the league of legends team anymore. I hope she could keep the position of president and continue to do an excellent job with other titles, while the TSM LoL roster would operate outside of her influence.

I think this solution makes 100% sense and stops this PR nightmare that has already caused way too much damage, to spiral completely out of control. 

TSM is looking into picking up a valorant team and we have many other titles with stacked rosters. It would not be a demotion, it would be a professional move by the entire org."

What I have observed over the years is that Kimi is an extreme Finn. He represents a lot of the stereotypical traits of our people, but he does so in a true way. What I mean is that you don’t get the sense he is ever doing it to gain fame. He is just himself.

I come from a very small town in Finland and all of my family that watches f1 absolutely adores Kimi for this. I was visiting my mother some time last year and some race was on, I cant remember which one it was. At some point during the race I asked her what she thinks of Bottas, and she just said he is ok but he is no Kimi. 

This is purely anecdotal and based on a very limited amount of conversations I’ve had, but I think this same thought process happens a lot everywhere. Valtteri is more or less always in Kimi’s shadow when it comes to who is the country’s favorite.

Balance is such a delicate process in gaming. For instance, modern day WoW is arguably very balanced in pvp (at least it was when I last played it). But that balance was achieved through the process of homogenization of all the classes in the game. This was extremely unappealing to play. Every class does more or less the same thing and most fights feel like wet noodle slapfests. In TFT, equally unappealing to play were demons in set1 when they were stupid OP.
