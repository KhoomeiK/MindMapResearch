InformationTechnology,fq9xsas,t1_fq6r3wf,1589209125.0,"No, that's the crazy thing with IRQ errors - there's no outward sign that something went wrong except for something that was working will suddenly not work and something that should work never will.  

With most old devices IRQs are set with an actual jumper on the device itself.  Normally devices of a certain type can have a couple or few different IRQ numbers to choose (set by placing the jumper across pins on the actual device itself).  If two devices try to use the same IRQ they both will fail - though generally not at the same time.  One device will come up and active first and then when the second device tries to the same IRQ - BOOM.  Both fail.

The more I think about it the more I think an IRQ on that would affect the operating system load is remote but, at the same time, that is the a lot of devices would come active.  But the hard drive?  At this point I don't think that would be the case but you never know.

One way to test it is to unplug EVERYTHING that isn't required - floppy drives, CDROMs, etc, from the IDE bus (by removing the ribbon cable).  Leave only the HD, monitor, mouse, and keyboard - i.e. just what is required to boot the machine and literally nothing else and see if that changes anything.

When you were in the BIOS settings was there an option to boot from USB?  I doubt very much there would be but you never know, XP was sold for an eternity, but at the same time I doubt a USB boot would be an option.

I like the idea of the bootable CDROM to boot Ubuntu and then test the system from there.  You may have to get into the BIOS to change your boot order, putting the CDROM ahead of the hard drive but that's not a big deal.  

If you want to go really old school from back in my era you can [create a bootable floppy disk](http://schierlm.users.sourceforge.net/bootdisk/) for the hell of it and boot that way.

Oh, back to RAM.  How much do you have installed and across how many sticks?  Some of the older computers have to run even numbers of sticks, and the same size, so you might not be able to remove one for testing.. or maybe you can.

So, just to be clear, small, new parent company wanted each employee to launch a VPN client from their laptop and connect directly to the new parent company over that VPN tunnel.  They wanted it this way because they wanted to force the users to connect ONLY through the office network, i.e. the VPN router on their end would only accept incoming tunnel requests from the IP address of our Internet facing router.  This seemed 10,000 degrees of stupid but, hey, they are the bosses, right?

Next came the request that each and every SYSTEM (all development servers, etc) were to connect through the VPN and all individually with their own VPN client.  This was in the days before cloud hosting was such a thing and it was at this point I said ""ok, WTF?  All we are going to accomplish with this is duplication of traffic and it's just not necessary"" but my hand was slapped or thinking outside the box and I was told, ""you go do what I say now or you go bye-bye!""  Ok, boss, whatever you say.

Except that's not what I did.   I set up a Linux box directly behind our firewall and with some iptables magic using DNAT and SNAT, with fine blend of fresh dual-stack IPv6 connectivity on ""our"" office side for systems and people, I somehow cobbled together what amounted to a Linux-based VPN IPv6 to IPv4 NAT router - and the damn thing worked!!  Honestly, for the rest of the day I just kind of sat there starting at the thing thinking ""this should not have worked but.. does.  Neat"".  It was cool and there's no way I could have pulled that off today.  I haven't touched iptables in... forever and fw?  Fagetaboutit.  No way.  

The top brass at the parent company thought it was neat too because the next day when I arrived at the office they were already there, changing locks and removing hard drives from everything in the building (well, our two offices in a larger building).  I was told to surrender there laptop and was handed my final check.  Turns out my little VPN gizmo had moved their timetables up considerably and instead of winding down our little operation over the next six weeks and slowly siphoning off the code we had created on their terms (which was their plan) we were all terminated that day and given one week of severance.

First was my script grew come a simple automated data collator to something closer to a 24x7 data QA process.  One big thing I found, even though everyone said was not possible, was where you had PDFs with ""Page 1 of x"" was to keep track of which pages had been processed and how many pages the overall PDF was to being with.  My old script would find, at times, two PDFs that had been munged together some how so one PDF might have ""Page 1 of 14"" though ""Page 14 or 14"" and then ""Page 1 of xx"" right behind that - in the same PDF.  Whatever it was I used to process all this, and I apologize, the code that I was is behind the firewall at a financial institution never to see the light of day, the first thing I would do say gather a list of the actual number of pages and make sure that the page headers agreed with that.. and I would keep set of unique page numbers that were processed, i.e. if somehow your PDF happened to have two ""Page 3 or 26"" that was important to flag.  I only point that out because that ended up being a HUGE win and one that was applied to YEARS of digitally archived PDFs looking for such errors.

One day, after purchasing upgraded case and power supply, Uzi asked me to let him put it together, I think because the power supply and case were both new models he was carrying and the two had not been assembled as one.

Camouflage allows a member of his species to bridge life of his own species and a different species, the normal human being. The normal human doesn't notice the presence of this other species and they have accepted this interloper as one of their own.  The tell-tale signs of trespass are present but go unnoticed as the human has not yet considered something other than one of their own walks among them.

Despite his having gone to his scheduled meeting last night and txt'ed with his sponsor this morning the crack addict has taken that detour on his way to work down the well-worn path towards the place of commerce for users and dealer species known as a ""trap"".  Inside the trap we see several species of users huddled together in tight quarters: the heroin user sits next to the meth user who shares space with the crack head and our functioning addict stands out, showered, and neatly dressed in the what appears to be the skin of a normal human but everyone in the room knows his ruse.  His presence draws no outward notice from the long-duration trap residents.  One would think such close confines would lead to conflict but, no, all is quiet in the trap, as it is most days.  Conflict could lead to the alpha dealer having to take discipline the group to restore order and that could lead to a visit from the police and none of the residents want that.

Quietly, with his head hung low, our functioning addict quietly approaches the alpha dealer and extends his hand.  The two need not communicate verbally for both known the routine.  The user hands over his cash and receives in the palm of his hand a small package containing his master and just as quietly as he entered our addict turns to leave and he walks back out towards the blinding light of the rising sun to continue us journey to work where he will take a quick hit along the long, straight section of road where where he feels safe and from there, to work where, unbeknownst to him, a milestone is passing: day 3650, a full ten years of his passing himself off a member a different species, come and goes without fanfare or notice."

I am not affiliated with regex101 at all or in any way beyond a true love for the site.  Copy your body of text into the window and start figuring out the regex at the top - and you can use different regex syntaxes for different languages and thus translate one kind of regex to another because the syntax isn't exactly the same (say Python to Golang).

NOooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!  I say that as a HAM radio operator.  :).  Those things.. wow, I mean, if you have to use one, use one.

If an end device does not support 5Ghz but is plugged into something via Ethernet and that Ethernet connection can pass traffic that should be the preferred path for the device (i.e. it just won't bother with wireless if it has Ethernet).

You don't necessary need something specialized labeled a ""wifi extender"" in most cases.  Many access points and routers have multiple modes of operating and some have the ability to act as a wireless bridge between the existing wifi network and the device you want to plug in (the PS4 in this case).

If you were going to spend 40 to 60 bucks I would get a Raspberry Pi and roll your own wireless bridge, but then again I'm a glutton for punishment (but you *could* do it that way and it would work, eventually.. once you worked all the bugs out which may take a very, very long time).

Back to the extender - the 2.4 Ghz extender may work because that device is going to have more gain on the antenna for transit and receive and likely a higher power radio (in interim of milliwatt output).  Two rules standing rules of wireless are 1) height equals might and 2) if you can't talk over someone f'ing scream over them.  :)

Sok, quick question - if the PS4 is the ONLY THING that needs to use the 2.4 Ghz frequency on your house my suggestion would be to try to set the country code on both the router and the wifi extender to Japan.  Set 2.4 Ghz to use channel 14 and that should eliminate all your problems because you will be the only person there and your two devices (router rated extender) won't be in competition with anyone else for frequency space.

That said if you get some crotchety old HAM radio codger that sees you using channel 14 he may slowly amble over with an onion on his belt to tell you what a horrible person you are.  But, really, if the PS4 is the only device that needs to be or uses 2.4 Ghz set the country code to Japan, reboot both devices, set 2.4 to use channel 14 on both sides and you should be good to go.

Glad I could help!  And let us know if it works.  It's going to work.. I mean, all the wireless chips sets have all 14 Channels built in because it costs too much to create a US spec chip and a ""nearly everywhere else"" chip and that's why channel access is controlled via software normally through setting the country code.

Good luck!!"
InformationTechnology,fo8o6dp,t1_fo8ize2,1587600437.0,"If you run ""in-between"" channels what you are going to end up doing is trashing the two channels on either side so, basically, you are making things worse for everyone who is trying to use what sounds to be a an overcrowded 2.4 Ghz frequency band."
InformationTechnology,fo8nyzr,t3_g69j2b,1587600322.0,"I've been using the 2.4 Ghz spectrum before there was 802.11 (wifi) gear that used it.  Here are my thoughts:

There are four non-overlapping channels globally in the 2.4 Ghz range for 802.11b and those are 1, 6, 11, and 14.  In the US we don't have access to anything about channel 11 but if you change your country code from US to say JP (Japan) then you should see channel 14 pop up automagically.  

Depending on where you live the entire 2.4 Ghz band may be totally unusable.  This was the case for me when I lived in my apartment in Texas for the last 18 moths.  Literally everyone had wireless plus tablets, xboxes, phones, computers, blah blah blah.  It's amazing how many devices try to use that bandwidth - it's a lot!

Here's the big question: what kind of router/access point do you have (make and model) and what are you trying to connect to it?  Older devices may only have a single 2.4 Ghz radio where newer devices have a 2.4 Ghz and a 5.8 Ghz radio.  The two spectrums propagate signals differently through different substances but that is a discussion beyond this scope.

If you have devices that \*can\* use 5.8 Ghz (often just abbreviated as 5 Ghz) you are better going with that frequency because there you have access to 24 non overlapping channels vs. the 3 you have for the US 2.4 Ghz frequency.

For the devices that can \*only\* use 2.4 Ghz see if there is a way you can plug them into the router with good, old Ethernet.  You will rid yourself of many, many headaches that way, believe me.  

Ok, so that's enough to start with: 1) does route router/access point support 5 Ghz?  2) Do the devices you want to connect to it support 5 Ghz?  3) can devices that only support 2.4 Ghz, can they use hard-wired Ethernet instead of wireless?

\*\*\* and yes, I know I oversimplified the frequency stuff and didn't differentiate between 802.11b/g/n blah blah blah."
