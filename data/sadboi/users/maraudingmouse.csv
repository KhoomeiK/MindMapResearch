KneadyCats,fje6eyr,t3_fcttbj,1583266126.0,Love her. My torti likes making bread too. I don't know what I would do without a torti in my life ü•∞
Anxiety,finrlga,t1_fimnpex,1582568828.0,Thank you ‚ù§ They are here in the evenings and it does help knowing there is someone else in the house when I go to sleep
Anxiety,filtegw,t3_f8jpcd,1582509890.0,"I drink calming tea, listen to calming music and take something to sleep"
Anxiety,filtb05,t3_f8js1a,1582509823.0,"Anxiety is awful but you will come out the other side. I've had anxiety for about 6 years now, I still have ups and downs but the ups always come and that's what you need to focus on :)
Great that you have your girlfriend with you!
My husband is away right now and that's the trigger for my anxiety"
Anxiety,filt2f0,t3_f8jv94,1582509661.0,"Not the best advice but I wasn't in the right headspace for work today so I took a half day sick leave after I did everything I needed to.
I've luckily got some time in lieu so not going in again until Thursday when my hubby is back from his course, where he is currently and not allowed to make contact at all as part of the course. His absence is the trigger for my anxiety :("
AskReddit,filpsxq,t3_f8csdm,1582507395.0,"Sometimes I want peace and quiet.

Often though I don't like to be alone. My anxiety is the sort where I want to be around people and talking and interacting so that I don't have time to think"
cats,fi2x664,t1_fi289gi,1582091974.0,So cute sitting with his mama ‚ù§
AskReddit,feah6af,t3_eo3q9l,1578948659.0,Currently alone in my office but I deal with recruitment so someone could walk in to ask a question any time and that would be difficult to explain

kittens,f812w0y,t3_dy9khp,1574147560.0,I want to kiss her little fluffy face
AskReddit,f7ilfir,t3_dw18l9,1573761490.0,"Meow at each other randomly. Sometimes when one of us is upstairs and the other is downstairs. I meow to make sure he's paying attention.
We point at our mouths and meow for a kiss. This one came from a Simon's Cat video called Cat Man Do where the cat points at his mouth and meows because he wants food"
newzealand,f7gek72,t1_f7drp6k,1573701681.0,"Don't make assumptions, I got in because my brother was already there so I wasn't actually in zone. 
All I said was there was a wide range of cultures. My last year there was 2011 so it was some time ago.

You're also assuming that race has to be split on economic lines which it doesn't. I can assure you there were European kids who grew up in Glen Innes, Panmure, etc and Maori kids who grew up in areas such as St Heliers."
newzealand,f7dq0v3,t1_f7dpgto,1573624956.0,"Definitely someone trying to start shit. I went to Glendowie, there was definitely not some system in place to keep Maori and Pacific Islanders out. We had a wide range of cultures there"
MomForAMinute,f0my5p8,t1_f0kfi2h,1568755815.0,"I've gone down the path of getting my husband off the ship if possible. I'm really struggling and my health is suffering.

He said he'll support me because it's what I need to do and I am priority. I'm lucky to have a husband who cares so much"
Anxiety,f0l37ih,t3_d5c3xn,1568696706.0,"I'm also in New Zealand and trust me they won't just hospitalise you if you tell them about your anxiety.

The system here, they generally won't do a whole lot unless you are suicidal.

I've been dealing with the system for about 6 years now and I get pretty severe. For example, I've only eaten today because my hubby told me to and I hate stressing him out"
Anxiety,f0l31er,t3_d5c5fs,1568696509.0,"I'd say you have mild anxiety. Just from your descriptions.

Having anxiety doesn't necessarily mean having panic attacks. They are one of the more severe symptoms"
Anxiety,f0kxv60,t3_d5ayfv,1568691199.0,"I wish I could offer advice. Last night I ended up taking my extra anxiety pill, not the one I take every day. It was the only way to stop my legs shaking.

When I'm a smidge more functional than right now, I take magnesium, zinc, ashwagandah and mood/immune probiotics.

Sometimes I take a pill called phenergan (promethazine hydrochloride) to try knock myself out for a decent night's sleep"
Anxiety,f0kt5xh,t1_f0kschk,1568687435.0,I hope it helps :) I'm going through a rough patch and miss that yoga studio. Mindfulness can also be really helpful but requires catching yourself before you start to go into full anxiety mode
Anxiety,f0ksnug,t3_d58xgd,1568687065.0,Wish I could offer advice but I'm in the same boat. I'm probably going to ask my manager about being able to work from home when I'm really struggling because hubby doesn't want me driving when I'm super anxious and he is away
Anxiety,f0ksglb,t3_d59bt3,1568686918.0,Not too sure what you mean by baiting responses out of them but I really struggle to keep plans when I'm going through a rough patch. I always say that I'm struggling but I do get scared that they won't understand
Anxiety,f0ks9ty,t3_d59sxy,1568686782.0,I try to distract myself. Before I moved house I used to go to yoga at a studio near my old house and do a type called Yin Yoga which made me breath. The environment with other understanding people also really helped me to be in the moment when I was there
Anxiety,f0krzvw,t3_d5adzh,1568686585.0,Can somewhat relate. I say I have a sixth sense for anything that will upset me cause lately I get tense a few days before receiving bad/upsetting news
Anxiety,f0krk1y,t1_f0kqb39,1568686265.0,Thank you! I'm going through a rough patch right now so I really appreciate it
Anxiety,f0kbd6z,t3_d51tw5,1568675170.0,"Same. I'm home sick from work because I made my anxiety worse by eating takeaways which didn't agree with me and ended up being sick last night.

I've made it from the bed to the couch and doing my best to take small sips of water so I don't get dehydrated"
Anxiety,f0kb6dr,t3_d56opw,1568675024.0,I don't touch caffeine if I can avoid it. My anxiety is stronger so I just tend to have adrenaline running all the time
Anxiety,f0kauxy,t1_f0k55qf,1568674783.0,"Gosh, some days I wish it were possible to be fixed. Just wish I could take a magic wand and get rid of my anxiety with a flourish.

Instead I'm home sick from work today because I got food poisoning and my hubby might be away Monday to Friday next week which has kicked my anxiety into overdrive"
Anxiety,f0k3dww,t3_d4uzu9,1568669310.0,"I'm so sorry you feel that way, please don't give up. I'm having one of those days and I'm so tired of feeling this way too. It does get better but like everything else in life it takes time"
Anxiety,f0k338p,t3_d56660,1568669100.0,"I do but you can't let it control you. I call myself a high functioning anxious person because I can be fine for months and then a few things pile up and I'm having panic attacks, nausea and in the case of today I'm home sick from work.

I do get scared what people think and I work for an organization who say they understand but don't often back it up. 

We're all human and one way to see it is that if we were back in caveman days the excess adrenaline would have made us badass"
Anxiety,f0k2s19,t3_d53fmu,1568668885.0,"You're not alone, I'm anxious about pretty much the next two and a half months. Going to bed is stressful because it makes everything that I'm scared about another day closer"
Anxiety,f0k2ma4,t3_d4xmk0,1568668775.0,I do this too. I was up sick last night with food poisoning and every time I get back into bed I clutch my phone like a safety blanket
Anxiety,f0k2d73,t3_d52lm1,1568668600.0,Some days I wish I did. I live with my hubby and our two cats but sometimes he has to go away for work and at those times I wish I could just go home to my mom
EatCheapAndHealthy,f0h2nrm,t1_exwsc4r,1568611578.0,All I ate today was a banana. Not a great day for my eating habits or my anxiety but I always have a banana on hand just in case

We joke about how accident prone we are a lot"
news,f05omf2,t1_f05i5cl,1568415272.0,"Ah, I see. NZ Herald are definitely one to be taken with a grain of salt. I barely even look at them anymore due to their fairly biased reporting and the fact that reading news articles with constant spelling/grammatical errors is painful"
news,f05fifm,t1_f0517s6,1568408555.0,"A little curious where this stat comes from? They haven't even run all of the planned sessions across the country yet.
And as someone who has studied journalism in New Zealand far too much, take everything the media here say with a grain of salt. They are absolutely full of shit, passing themselves off as looking out for the average NZer but constantly publishing alarmist and fear mongering nonsense."
AskReddit,eypspas,t3_cy079n,1567309984.0,"I'm having a down day with my anxiety, a few too many stressful things happening at once has set it off"
AskReddit,er85buo,t3_c0qaj7,1560596479.0,"Yup, made life pretty difficult for a while but better long term. That was about six years ago.

Still gets tempting some times but not because of the workplace, my anxiety happens due to other things and makes me want to retreat. I know it's better for me to work and be busy though"
