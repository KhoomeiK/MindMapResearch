I’m really torn on this because 9/10 times I advocate for the traditional spelling, but I also love sentimental ties. 

I wonder if the “Ann” sound that comes out when pronouncing the last half of Cheyenne might be enough here? I realize I’m not as invested as you are in this, but I think I could make the connection between the two names while using the traditional spelling. That way, she’d avoid having her name misspelled by others quite as often but still get the added benefit of tying to your middle name. Just food for thought! :)"

I definitely would not capitalize the C in Jacoby; that’s an established name IMO and doesn’t need anything else to help with pronunciation. FWIW, I know a girl with this as her first name, but her parents replaced the Y with an “ie.” I think either is fine for a little lady — especially since it will be in the middle name spot. 

Of your male first names, I prefer Cole. It’s not a name I would use myself, but I keep wanting to change Carlo to Carlos, so Cole is better IMO. 

I’ve never seen that male middle name before; I’m Caucasian and in America, so perhaps it’s a cultural thing I’m unaware of? If not, I wouldn’t use it. I’m not really even sure how to pronounce it, if I’m perfectly honest.

• There’s no such thing as name-stealing. We went however many years with a gazillion kids running around with the same name, so if your best friend uses the name you love, it doesn’t mean you can’t use it, too.

namenerds,etsymwz,t3_cdbll1,1563159217.0,"I think it totally depends on the person, his/her family, and their overall lifestyle. 

Personally, I use my middle name and that of those I love quite often. I “middle name” my kids when I’m trying to get their attention, I “middle name” DH when I’m expressing lots of emotion (good or bad haha), and I use my own middle name on social media. 

I’m a fan of middle names for a few reasons. Probably the biggest advantage I can think of is that they can help differentiate your child from others — particularly if you use a more common first name and/or have a common surname. It’s probably very, very rare, but I’ve heard the stories of people who share names and even birthdays being mixed up in court or with the police, so of course having one more differentiating factor would be helpful in those instances. The other biggest advantage I can think of is in regards to letting your child have more options as he/she grows older. As parents we choose names we love and/or that have sentimental value to us, but our kids sometimes want or need to change what they go by as they grow up. Giving a middle name can give a kid more options rather than having to go to the extreme of legally changing their name. 

All that said, if your other kids don’t have middle names, I probably wouldn’t give this baby one, either!"

AppleWatch,espfmg8,t3_c8394k,1562183599.0,"I was like you — wasn’t really sure why I needed one, but I sure wanted an Apple Watch. I finally bit the bullet. At first I told a friend I liked it but wasn’t sure I’d rebuy when this one dies, but now I’m singing a different tune. 

Features I use frequently: checking the time and weather: setting alarms, timers, and reminders, pinging my phone when I misplace it; grabbing something in the dark with my Watch’s flashlight before I leave for work when my SO is still sleeping; checking things off my grocery list while I shop; declining spam calls easily; monitoring text messages; controlling my music, especially while I’m driving; getting alerts when I need to turn while driving; and tracking workouts and movement. 

TL;DR: I thought it was just an expensive piece of metal with some convenient pieces when I first got it, but now I’m a fan and will be upgrading when the new watch comes out this fall!"

Parenting,esj6h0r,t3_c7wea0,1562026941.0,"As someone who was forced to give physical contact to random people in my childhood just to make my parents look good, I applaud your efforts. SO and I are going the same route with our children. We don’t expect it to be a perfect solution, but whatever consent we can teach and model at home is going to be a helluva lot better than what I experienced growing up."

Have you ever considered providing an eCourse or book? I’m envisioning one for hikers/campers, of course, but you could also do one for natural disasters. 

Also: I read a YA novel a few months ago called “Dry;” it was about an extreme water shortage. I’m now wondering how accurate and realistic one of the protagonists’ survival methods were, and what you would’ve done!"

What about channeling Chipotle and making different “bowls”? You could add a protein (maybe ground turkey or chicken?) with rice or quinoa, and then add in veggies. I usually do frozen veggies like edamame, peas, carrots, broccoli, etc. so it’s even faster. Top with avocado or a sauce and call it a day!"
IAmA,eqqeoih,t1_eqpzyb5,1560219211.0,"Not OP, but I feel compelled to reply. If one of my children died before me — no matter the method or who/what was at fault — I was be absolutely devastated. It would shatter me. 

Please don’t make a permanent decision based on temporary feelings! You are important. You were born for a reason. If you need to talk, feel free to DM me!"
