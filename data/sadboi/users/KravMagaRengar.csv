besoindeparler,fr5isvt,t3_gjolou,1589909249.0,"Ca peu etre un gosse qui s'amusait, quand j'avais 14 and j'etais un garcon tres timide, sensible et serviable, mais avec mes amis parfois ont allait dans les jardins des gens prendre leurs petite veilleuse a energie solaire ou que sais-je ce que l'on trouvais.

On se rendais pas compte se ce qu'on faisais, pour nous ce n'etait qu'un jeux, ""rien de grave"", que du materiel sans reel valeur... La débilité des jeunes ados quoi. On a jamais pensé a mal du genre ""voler ça ca va leurs faire du mal c'est cool""

La personne qui te l'a prise ne se rend probablement pas compte de ce que ca représente pour toi."
besoindeparler,fr5hbj6,t3_glrdzt,1589908565.0,"Je suis passé par mille tourments dans ma vie, le coup du train je connais un peu. Mais non, ca s'arrangera. A 20 ans j'etais pareil, aujourd'hui j'ai bientot 25 ans et malgré toute la souffrance je vais mieux. Et c'est encore meilleur d'aller mieux car j'appreci ce bien etre par rapport a la catastrophe et au desert sentimental que j'ai traversé pendant 5 ans. Parfois j'ai des rechutes de mal etre, parfois je suis plus heureux qu'un millionaire. Et c'est comme ça pour tout le monde. 

Je vais pas jouer au psy je suis pas doué pour ça, je prefere te donner mon point de vue de scientifique en herbe.. desolé si tu a besoin de soutien j'espere que les autres t'en donneront.

Je ne veux pas travailler pour un patron et tu n'a pas l'air de vouloir non plus. 
C'est pas un soucis, en 2020 il suffit de se renseigner sur un peu de tout sur internet, de temps en temps, meme des choses qui paraissent futiles. Ca developpe des connexions, ton cerveau fera le travail. Puis tu trouvera des idées de buisness.
En fournissant 15h de travail par semaine, t'aura un salaire bien superieur a un Smic avec une idée banale, le buisness tiendra 2 ans puis s'écroulera, mais t'aura d'autres idées deja en tete pour un nouveau.

Je te parle d'eviter de trop consommer les réseaux sociaux et netflix (ce que tout le monde fait), et plutot d'aller sur des sites underground, lire des articles sur differents sujet.
C'est ça la clef.

Ensuite.

L'importance du sommeil est grandement sous estimé. Les AD t'aidait a dormir ?
C'est le pillier de la vie. Il y a une etude scientifique qui de montre que meme dormir avec une petite veilleuse dans la chambre agrave la depression de 30%, imagine ne pas dormir dutout.
Peu etre qu'une clinique du sommeil t'aidera a ce niveau ? Je recommande en tout cas, un specialiste sur ce sujet pourra t'aider.

Ensuite tu dis avoir pris 40kg, au delà de la pression psychologique que les autres mettent sur toi (ex obese au college pour moi) et la pression que tu te met toi inconsciement par rapport a ton toi d'avant, il y a aussi tout un système hormonal qui fonctionne mal.
Baisse de testosterone, hausse des oestrogènes, hausse du cortisol, thyroide qui fonctionne moins bien,resistance a l'insuline qui creer un brouillard mental et des mini hypoglycemie entre les repas..
Bref.

Je te dis tout ça car il y a pas besoin de trouver le traumatisme que tu ne connais pas pour aller mieux. Bien dormir et perdre du poid (doucement c'est pas une course) vont creer de grand changement dans ton mal etre.

Donc mon conseil est d'aller voir a la fois un psychiatre pour reprendre les AD si tu le souhaite, mais surtout un nutritioniste (normalement c'est remboursé car c'est des médecins) pour des conseils sur l'alimentation et la perte de poid. 

Changement alimentaire plutot que sport, parceque je comprend que tu n'a absolument pas (pour le moment, ca viendra) la motivation d'aller a la sale ou courir.

Bon courage !"
