besoindeparler,fr5isvt,t3_gjolou,1589909249.0,"Ca peu etre un gosse qui s'amusait, quand j'avais 14 and j'etais un garcon tres timide, sensible et serviable, mais avec mes amis parfois ont allait dans les jardins des gens prendre leurs petite veilleuse a energie solaire ou que sais-je ce que l'on trouvais.

On se rendais pas compte se ce qu'on faisais, pour nous ce n'etait qu'un jeux, ""rien de grave"", que du materiel sans reel valeur... La d√©bilit√© des jeunes ados quoi. On a jamais pens√© a mal du genre ""voler √ßa ca va leurs faire du mal c'est cool""

La personne qui te l'a prise ne se rend probablement pas compte de ce que ca repr√©sente pour toi."
besoindeparler,fr5hbj6,t3_glrdzt,1589908565.0,"Je suis pass√© par mille tourments dans ma vie, le coup du train je connais un peu. Mais non, ca s'arrangera. A 20 ans j'etais pareil, aujourd'hui j'ai bientot 25 ans et malgr√© toute la souffrance je vais mieux. Et c'est encore meilleur d'aller mieux car j'appreci ce bien etre par rapport a la catastrophe et au desert sentimental que j'ai travers√© pendant 5 ans. Parfois j'ai des rechutes de mal etre, parfois je suis plus heureux qu'un millionaire. Et c'est comme √ßa pour tout le monde. 

Je vais pas jouer au psy je suis pas dou√© pour √ßa, je prefere te donner mon point de vue de scientifique en herbe.. desol√© si tu a besoin de soutien j'espere que les autres t'en donneront.

Je ne veux pas travailler pour un patron et tu n'a pas l'air de vouloir non plus. 
C'est pas un soucis, en 2020 il suffit de se renseigner sur un peu de tout sur internet, de temps en temps, meme des choses qui paraissent futiles. Ca developpe des connexions, ton cerveau fera le travail. Puis tu trouvera des id√©es de buisness.
En fournissant 15h de travail par semaine, t'aura un salaire bien superieur a un Smic avec une id√©e banale, le buisness tiendra 2 ans puis s'√©croulera, mais t'aura d'autres id√©es deja en tete pour un nouveau.

Je te parle d'eviter de trop consommer les r√©seaux sociaux et netflix (ce que tout le monde fait), et plutot d'aller sur des sites underground, lire des articles sur differents sujet.
C'est √ßa la clef.

Ensuite.

L'importance du sommeil est grandement sous estim√©. Les AD t'aidait a dormir ?
C'est le pillier de la vie. Il y a une etude scientifique qui de montre que meme dormir avec une petite veilleuse dans la chambre agrave la depression de 30%, imagine ne pas dormir dutout.
Peu etre qu'une clinique du sommeil t'aidera a ce niveau ? Je recommande en tout cas, un specialiste sur ce sujet pourra t'aider.

Ensuite tu dis avoir pris 40kg, au del√† de la pression psychologique que les autres mettent sur toi (ex obese au college pour moi) et la pression que tu te met toi inconsciement par rapport a ton toi d'avant, il y a aussi tout un syst√®me hormonal qui fonctionne mal.
Baisse de testosterone, hausse des oestrog√®nes, hausse du cortisol, thyroide qui fonctionne moins bien,resistance a l'insuline qui creer un brouillard mental et des mini hypoglycemie entre les repas..
Bref.

Je te dis tout √ßa car il y a pas besoin de trouver le traumatisme que tu ne connais pas pour aller mieux. Bien dormir et perdre du poid (doucement c'est pas une course) vont creer de grand changement dans ton mal etre.

Donc mon conseil est d'aller voir a la fois un psychiatre pour reprendre les AD si tu le souhaite, mais surtout un nutritioniste (normalement c'est rembours√© car c'est des m√©decins) pour des conseils sur l'alimentation et la perte de poid. 

Changement alimentaire plutot que sport, parceque je comprend que tu n'a absolument pas (pour le moment, ca viendra) la motivation d'aller a la sale ou courir.

Bon courage !"
