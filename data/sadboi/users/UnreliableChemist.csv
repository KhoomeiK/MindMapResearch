Guitar,fqwfy3v,t3_gl4ius,1589703018.0,"Ok so here's what I've learned from 6 months of it (literally absolute beginner before then)

1. Gear doesn't matter, *at first*

Your kit seems quite good for a beginner, I'm still rocking my £100 Rockjam guitar/amp. So you're doing well already.

2. Make sure you're in tune

Download a tuner app on your phone is it's not included in the kit (I use guitar tuner, there is a fender made one too)

3. Learn some basic chords

Chords are great, learn 5 or 6 and you can do a vibing little version of most pop songs from the last 20 years. The starter ones in my opinion are C, Em, D, Am, G and A.

4. YouTube is an excellent teacher

Once you're getting good, places like Ultimate-guitar will be helpful, but because anyone can make and post there it's hard to know if it's right to the ears. YouTube on the other hand you can listen to and see if it's right or not.

A great channel in my opinion is GuitarZeroToHero, lots of popular songs and very very well made videos with on-screen diagrams to help.

That's all I can think of at the moment, any questions let me know. I was like you literally 6/7months ago and you'll look back and be amazed at your progress!"
Guitar,fqwfhic,t3_gl9w67,1589702549.0,"Practice and it'll come in time. What I would do is find the specific 'switch' for a song, say C to F to Am, then loop that over and over.

Good luck and make sure to strum each string slowly at first to ensure none are accidentally muted"
Guitar,fqwf9nn,t1_fqvh338,1589702332.0,"So first you'll want to wind the string until it's firm (no sag) but still way off tune. The. Repeat that for the remaining 5 strings.

Then you'll want to go back to string 1, get it closer to being in-tune **but not all the way**. Then repeat that for the other 5. 

Then maybe strum quite a bit on them, and repeat step 2 until you're at the point where they're in-tune.

Because not only do you want to ease your strings to their full tightness, the neck will also slightly change as the pressure of the 6 strings being wound on, this way you keep it all done smoothly and less chance of breaking one


Source: Did it myself, and now have 5 spare strings in-case another breaks"
