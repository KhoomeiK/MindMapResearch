BPD,fr6ar6c,t3_gmwzf6,1589922909.0,"yes, also nineteen im a girl and i dont think ill ever have children. i know how badly my parents messed up and i dont want that. there was a period in my life when i wanted kids but i realized now that i 'wanted' kids then just because my bf at the time really wanted kids in the future."
BPD,fr1hawh,t1_fr0urb1,1589819719.0,"you know, kind of hard to try when you do not know what these fulfilling things are. i drew pretty much all my life and i thought that made me happy. it doesnt. it makes me happy when ppl praise my art. i thougjt i like reading but i just like discussing the books with other people or i like the knoweledge the books bring me. its hard to know what i actually like"
BPD,fr0cdee,t1_fr0c37p,1589790658.0,we are expected to do so fucking much in our lives. but i get so exhausted from work mentally more than physically i just dont wanna do anything else. and sometimes waking up and living takes so much effort i cant do anything really. i feel like we should accept that.
BPD,fr0b6z0,t1_fr0aohl,1589789543.0,i just stick to doing nothing. i mean i dont really have time im working and when im not im trying to rest from working since it takes a huge toll on me. many people have no hobbies maybe we should normalize that.
BPD,fr09k0r,t1_fr08vch,1589788006.0,i feel like thats a lie too. if someone loves you they love you regardless if you love yourself. and sure i can 'love myself' it doesnt mean anyone else will.
BPD,fr09gue,t1_fr08kqa,1589787925.0,yeah same. i deal with that too. i dont think ill ever come out of 'puberty' and find myself.
BPD,fr086u3,t1_fqzumsv,1589786746.0,"sure i can accept it, other people cant and wont. people dont want their relationship to be a chore for them."
BPD,fr084v3,t1_fqzqiie,1589786695.0,nothing fullfils me except people loving me.
BPD,fr082jr,t1_fqzxkor,1589786637.0,we can use any other word and the point still stands. i will never have a healthy relationship because i am not healthy and wont ever be. its not a problem with words really.
BPD,fr07zm5,t1_fr0731z,1589786561.0,"same, i dont really even have time for hobbies and i dont want to start anything bc im not gonna be good at it and to me its not worth it."
BPD,fr07vj1,t1_fr002d5,1589786458.0,yes i want a healthy relationship but i cant have one bc im not healthy and will never get better.
BPD,fr07gm6,t1_fqzzyug,1589786084.0,i didnt really mean it like that. thx for the positivity but this isnt positive.
BPD,fqyqww3,t1_fqyq33g,1589753067.0,"yeah i feel you. i feel like i have to get past the initial grief this conclusion brings, if you understand. i feel sad that its like this because i love people, but im just not functional to have romantic relationships with them. its going to be very hard but i must get past it. also having no hobbys is kind of a thing too. but i guess i could just count being on the internet as a hobby. i dont think i like doing nothing and being on the phone so much as much as i need it. doing basic stuff tires me out and thats my safety net. just looking at stupid things and not thinking. im sad right now it all sounds very sad but i need to accept this sad fact of my life."
BPD,fqyoem7,t3_glnssx,1589751892.0,"im so sorry this happened to you. it is not your fault. 
im assuming you cant move out due to certain circumstances?"
BPD,fquyif3,t1_fquwmn0,1589666479.0,can you give an example? how does it work exactly? what method is used to cope?
BPD,fqu715i,t3_gkyvpm,1589653262.0,"if you are starting to obsess if they look at your social media posts or if they are online, i suggest you block or mute them. i became obsessed at one point and i had to cut it out. believe me sometimes as much as you hope theres something left there or that you are going to get back together, its really not the case. and believe me i went through that. i hope you are ok"
BPD,fqq2wsl,t1_fqq08f4,1589558480.0,well im not fucking sure either all i know is that im losing my fucking mind at work including now and i feel like fucking shit i just wanna quit so fucking bad. i have mental breakdowns every day over this and idk what to fucking do. i just want some fucking support.
BPD,fqpawsu,t1_fqp8g0z,1589541105.0,sure
BPD,fqp6e3m,t1_fqp4m3j,1589536654.0,he really reminds me of me haha this is probably how my friends see me. no wonder they dont like me. and they probably have given up on me too lol. sorry this made me feel like shit. it really solidifies the fact that people just cant handle ppl with mental illnesses and that nobody will fully love me because of it.
BPD,fqp2pa1,t1_fqote03,1589532888.0,sorry but thats kinda shitty ppl usually write these things to get some support and feel like people actually care about them. you should try even if it doesnt stop them people wanna know theyre cared about. other people have done this shit to me like not responding because they dont know what to say or they cant help me it made me feel like shit and made me feel worse. so yeah... idk how your friend is doing i hope hes okay.
BPD,fqp25oh,t3_gjwy7t,1589532337.0,"people actually only care when  i threathen suicide .... and thats the sad truth, although some dont even care them bc according to them 'i always say that and im never going to actually do it' so yeah. i understand its not as simple as just dropping them and never speaking to them and sometimes we hold onto ppl that treat us poorly bc we have nobody else. and i definitely have that problem. i dont think any of my friends (except maybe one) respond to my problems in a nice manner and i dont think in the end they care and that they even take it seriously. they all just think im creating problems myself when theres no actual problem. its hard. its really hard."
BPD,fqp1l3w,t1_fqo41x5,1589531763.0,"i feel like im spoiled and really weak for this. everyone that begun working at this company in my hometown never quit because it was too hard for them. seems like im going to be the first person. ive been working for only 3 weeks and i have daily breakdowns. maybe it would be better at a more simple job but i dont know. now that ive read your post i doubt my level of stress and think im just being whiny. i dont think ill get a heart attack but my bpd has been deteriorating my physical well being for a while now. not eating enough or overeating, copious amounts of energy spent because ive been crying so much or had a panic attack but still having to continue doing stuff, throwing up every morning due to anxiety. even after writing all of that i dont think i am sick enough. i dont know how to explain this but i just feel like im so spoiled and i should just suck it up and learn to live in the real world where people have to work to earn money. it would be really dumb to quit this job for many reasons but i dont know if anyone takes it as badly as i am taking it."
BPD,fqj91oh,t3_gj84pt,1589406697.0, im so sorry this happened. i dont know how to help u but im sad that happened to you. i know how much it hurts.
BPD,fqewzgt,t3_gic6ys,1589314978.0,happy birthday and im so happy for you!!! last birthday i almost didnt cry and it was better than previous ones. thank you for sharing this.
BPD,fqeh2o9,t1_fqdgt2c,1589307439.0,yeah i live in bosnia and its the same shit there
BPD,fqd5s8h,t1_fqd4vsi,1589280719.0,do you mind me asking where are you from?
BPD,fqd30l0,t1_fqd2fnt,1589277977.0,"well you probably dont know where it is so it doesnt really matter if i tell you. and i dont think my country has that. everytjing about mental health is taboo here so. im not sure i can just work something out with a stranger on the internet, i think i need actual professional help. im sorry if this is a bit rude thank you for trying to help but yeah ..."
BPD,fqd29vf,t1_fqd25i5,1589277212.0,its a small country in europe
BPD,fq9xwkm,t1_fq9xaei,1589209191.0,"i dont know ... we havent talked since then, i do have an unsettling fear of him taking advatnage of my mental state even though he helps me and hes there for me when i have a problem... idk"
BPD,fq9w4vq,t1_fq9bseu,1589208218.0,im not sure hes being manipulative. he said im pretty and that im perfect to him but like he rejected prettier girls because they werent his type. im not sure i really dont know. he said before that that hes scared im going to 'leave' him (we're not really dating) for someone better if i had the chance and i tried to say that im not the only girl in the universe and he will probably meet someone better than me. and i said that im basically nothing special if u take away my looks and then he said that. idk...
BPD,fq8z0i7,t1_fq8oaec,1589179879.0,i really dont know because he was trying to make me feel better because i basically said im nothing apart from my looks and he said that he still likes me more than some prettier girls he rejected. i just dont like the fact that most people dont percieve me as pretty and that i am pretty to a select few people when i thought that wasnt the case. but earlier he also said he thinks im way prettier than him and that hes basically scared im gonna stop talking to him as soon as a better option comes through for me.
BPD,fq8yqg8,t1_fq83jtu,1589179620.0,"im not sure. we were talking about how hes scared im going to 'leave' him for someone else. we are not in a relationship we are just talking i made that really clear and that i might hook up with somebody else or get into a relationship if i like someone. our circumstances are difficult and we cant be in a relationship. like i was i guess trying to  make him feel better because he thinks that i have a lot of options and i will just forget about him when a better option comes my way and he doesnt have those options. and i tried to make him feel better by saying that im nowhere near a perfect girl and if you took away my physical appearance i am basically nothing that you would want. it sounds really crazy but i do think that actually. and then he said that i didnt have to be perfect and that he rejected prettier girls that were prettier to most people but also objectively pretty and that he likes me. the thing is i hate thinking that im not pretty to other people because i really put a lot of worth on my physical appearance because i just dont like anything abt my personality. and i thought i was attractive to most people and most people would describe me as pretty but i guess not. im not sure if this was manipulative or anything, i mostly just think its my problem for being really fucked in the head. but also he knows about all of my mental disorder stuff and he witnessed it and i cant help but think he might abuse that someday."
BPD,fq54dz2,t1_fq2ywzq,1589092148.0,i think it has to do more with the fact that i didnt have a good male figure growing up. i dont really appreciate the fact that you just said my personality disorder makes me unattractive to you or other men. like wow dude maybe you were trying to help but yeah choose your words wisely. i will keep that in mind that people are only interested in fucking me. it was already my insecurity.
BPD,fq2rf56,t3_ggg4pb,1589058904.0,right now i am talking to one guy and i like him but he also likes me a lot and shows it. but theres this other guy and i think he is the most charming person ive ever met and he doesnt seem to give two shits about me. and i literally cant stop thinking about him even though we dont talk and he clearly isnt interested but i have a guy who likes me and wants to talk to me. its fucked.
BPD,fpz0u3r,t1_fpx3jj0,1589011429.0,well im not sure nobody thinks im stupid. i cant know that for sure. i am not seeing a therapist right now. because of the covid situation im unable to and besides my previous therapist didnt really help me i cant search for a new one right now.
BPD,fpwz3e4,t1_fpwyoe0,1588972609.0,yeah it might be normal. however it is not normal to fall into suicidal and dissociative stares just because you think somebody's annoyed because you ask a lot of questions or you did something wrong. i cant control these resposnes and they are crippling me. i feel like my brain is in a million pieces.
BPD,fpw9ekp,t1_fpvxue8,1588959515.0,i have to learn a lot of new things and ask for help constantly it makes me feel really dumb
BPD,fpvjcx9,t3_gfs6sn,1588945966.0,its not wrong. i would get upset too. its really shitty of him to say and i have had situations like this before. it really hurts to hear that. im sorry that he said that to you.
BPD,fpphejt,t1_fpp9czb,1588802314.0,i hope everything's okay. best of luck
BPD,fpp6a42,t1_fpnprpk,1588796702.0,i think u should just tell her goodbye and leave it at that. it wasnt that long ago that she has moved on i guess.
SuicideWatch,fpp66pc,t1_fpnui7g,1588796656.0,yeah i watched that video. its great.
BPD,fpnots3,t3_gejb7l,1588769183.0,when was this last text sent?
SuicideWatch,fpnoo3e,t3_gej9gv,1588769072.0,i kinda think about this too. why is it that every time someone tells u i am hurting so severely i cant stand to live like it hurts to live someones like ohhh just stay strong keep on living. why? so i can hurt some more. like i get it its not like ur friends are going to say ok then just die (although i heard that a few times) but idk. ive been waiting my whole life for it to 'get better'.
Drugs,fpnh3kr,t1_fpngup9,1588762665.0,thank you
Drugs,fpngm9u,t1_fpng3gk,1588762200.0,i think i have zoloft and lamictal in my house right now. i used to take them. im not sure how many of them i have and yes that will be a problem when i run out because i dont have a prescription and it could be really bad. also i take birth control and meds for my thyroid problem so id have to check if i can take them with these meds. thank you for not judging.
BPD,fpng7jf,t3_gehhzm,1588761803.0,i just got my first job and my mental state went to shit. i think everyone hates me and i feel like i cant do it. currently feeling really suicidal also. sorry i dont have any tips but i relate a lot and need help with this too.
Drugs,fpneuin,t1_fpne86n,1588760452.0,"yeah um thank you but i really cant explain to u that in my country we dont actually have any of those resources. my primary care doctor would never put me on anti depressants and i could actually never ask bc there is so much stigma. also i went to many psychiatrists and therapist since like literal early childhood and they are terrible. they dismissed my problems because i wasnt 'abused' enough to have 'trauma' or problems in their opinion. they just gave me antidepressants as a preteen, as u said for kids there is a warning and they shouldnt really take it. they still gave them to me. hospitals are in terrible conditions ive seem them and i dont think anyone really gets better there. i appriciate ur help i really do. but at this point i think its better to take a shot with trying to do antidepressants by myself than waiting 6 months to see a psychatrist that wont help me. if i die i die :) cant get worse anyhow. thank u though."
BPD,fpndezc,t1_fpncw2h,1588758982.0,nope. not ok at all. thank u though
BPD,fpn6ev3,t1_fpm8zf1,1588751838.0,im happy for both of you. but i met enough people in my life to know they really wont :) believe me the people who i never thought would abandon and ignore me when i needed them did just that. so i dont really have any experience to base my belief that someone will accept me on.
BPD,fpm7fs5,t1_fpm4x3g,1588727103.0,"its complicated, but just take my word for it. i also think it wouldnt last long bc of my bpd. they seem like a person that doesnt wanna deal with that."
BPD,fplmn5y,t3_ge61ay,1588715472.0,ive never related to something so hard. u finally put into words what ive been feeling for ages.
BPD,fplb3kf,t3_ge51dl,1588709543.0,yeah or im not going to do it yet but one day its coming.
BPD,fphr3jc,t1_fpgl55w,1588626260.0,do you know the stats how many people with bpd also have adhd? im not sure if i have it and ive heard of this comorbidity for the first time today.
BPD,fpg1dzs,t1_fpfwqiq,1588591173.0,"maybe something like cw: mention of bpd abuse, or negative mention of bpd or something like that?"
BPD,fpfwas7,t1_fpfw69o,1588585939.0,"i dont think its censoring, im just worried about people being really triggered by this. i definitely feel for the person who posted this too and i thank them for not going to more hostile communities first but i feel like we should take care of everyone. is there a way of adding new flairs or something? thank you for listening btw its not a bad idea for now :)"
BPD,fpfw47q,t1_fpfq4pz,1588585740.0,"depends what parts of the world, i personally live in a third world country so the stigma hasnt really gotten better, actually most people dont even know what this disorder is. definitely happy you are better, just saying its different for everyone bc not everyone has the same circumstances"
BPD,fpfw120,t1_fpfoxh2,1588585645.0,i agree but maybe there should be some kind of warning?
BPD,fpfl7zt,t1_fpfa3xu,1588574721.0,"im happy for u that u have beat it. however for most people it will probably be a life long thing just like ur depression and anxiety. and depression and anxiety usually can get treated with antidepressants and pills but there is no distinct and proven medicine that works against bpd. also the stigma also contributes to the feeling this disorder is untreatable, because bpd people are just seen as irrational, manipulative and too much so people do not understand it and dont want to help people with it. its been my experience so far."
BPD,fpfkc8i,t3_gd3cpj,1588573913.0,"im actually not sure if this is the right sub to post this in. many people will read this and get really fucked up. im not invalidating ur experiences but many people are not abusive to other people. and posting in this sub, im not sure if its a good idea.
the title can be really triggering, if i wasnt in a state of numbness right now i would probably spiral and think nobody will ever love me because of my problems, its an insecurity i and many other people with bpd have. look, im not sure if these people are just toxic people and they can be that without bpd and i am sorry u went through abuse. i dont know what the initial question was here but i dont know if posting here and looking for support here is the right thing to do. i hope u understand."
BPD,fpfjkjn,t1_fpeeuub,1588573216.0,do you have any alternatives? these forms of treatment didnt help me either.
BPD,fpdtqqs,t1_fpdt83t,1588534053.0,yeah id like to try it because im kind of running out of options anyway. im glad it has helped u.
BPD,fpdt07h,t3_gctxkv,1588533627.0,im not sure. ive had mental problems all my life but i started really showing bpd symptoms around high school when i had my first relationships. thats when i remember it. but it started really spiraling badly last summer actually.
BPD,fpdsdaz,t1_fpds3g2,1588533261.0,"i mean, it is that."
BPD,fpdrdwc,t3_gcrq8n,1588532694.0,"i havent done any but ive been wanting to and ive been reading stuff about it and ive heard good responses from people who had mental problems. one of the things people recommend is being with a trusted person who can 'guide' u through ur trips. if ur alone in a dark room its more likely to become grim for u. i had a really bad time smoking weed one time in a closed dark space. ive heard people take psychadelics and see a whole other perspective like they see themselves in third person, or they will even talk to themselves like they are a seperate person. ive also read they are starting to test psychadelics again for mental ilnesses. and they experiment by giving the patient drugs and then a trained psychologist will be there with them during their trips which last a couple of hours. its a really hard, exhausting experience for some because they experience their traumas and go back to the times stuff went wrong and relive it and to 'resolve it'. its too early to say anything abt results but its proving pretty positive so far. if taking psychadelics in a controlled enivroment with professionals that can actually help was avaliable to more people i feel like it would solve a lot of pain. sorry for the long reply."
BPD,fpdiahz,t1_fpdh3xj,1588527532.0,'you need to be more confident' 'just move on its no big deal' 'stop caring about this person' are all amazing statements from people that just dont understand.
BPD,fpd8l04,t3_gcsklr,1588522053.0,wish i could send this to everyone in my life so they could finally understand i have an actual serious mental disorder. but they'd all think im quirky and trying to be different.
BPD,fpd7ssl,t3_gcrr1a,1588521603.0,totally get this. im currently not speaking with mine because i  just got enough. for me it was basically my entire family being toxic plus i got severely bullied by my peers from first to like eight grade. i dont think i need to forgive him and i dont think u need to forgive ur father. i feel like everyone always tells us to be less dramatic and keep on forgiving people who continue to hurt us. i say: fuck that. i support u.
BPD,fpcyn41,t1_fpclo8a,1588515977.0,"excuse me, but what did you think this sub was? like what do you expect from it? this is a serious question."
BPD,fpcye9d,t3_gcqyse,1588515815.0,"i feel like this too. everyone has problems and everyone has a right to express them and complain about them. however, some problems are a bit more complicated than others and some people cant solve them as quickly as someone else. i feel like people who dont have mental illnesses just dont understand we cant brush things off and move on most of the time. the problems we have impares our life, every second of living. they dont understand that."
BPD,fpcuct0,t3_gcq2ao,1588512913.0,"i just heard about this from your post and i went to check it out. quite honestly, i find all of those 'types' to me just moods and phases basically all people with bpd go through. although somebody might be more impulsive than discouraged i think everyone just goes through that. to me it seems kinda pointless to divide into types."
BPD,fpckn1i,t3_gco5k6,1588504097.0,"well you can ask for advice, im sure somebody will reply and try to help you. but i feel like this is a safe place for people to vent and get support. some people have problems getting diagnosed or getting actual professional help due to many different reasons. i would know all about that. so yes you can use this sub for what you want, to get helpful advice but not everyone will do that."
BPD,fpcc210,t1_fpc3i18,1588494911.0,"The mental health system in my country is really shitty so I dont really know. I had many experience with psychiatry and psychology and its really bad, they treated me really badly and gave me a lot of meds as a preteen. I dont really know where to reach out for help or evaluation. I've seen the same therapist for about 5 years on and off and I havent made much progress in my opinion. Im not sure what to do there."
BPD,fpc7kxz,t1_fpb195l,1588490308.0,can you maybe tell me what those side effects are?
BPD,fpal5km,t1_fpacfsm,1588450425.0,dont apologize please i totally get it. my ex also triggered my traumas countless times and also told me something similar at the end. i am so sorry he put u through this and i hope u can get through it and maybe move to another city u feel comfortable in. u are loved dont forget that
BPD,fpabgvj,t3_gcbaoe,1588444699.0,"i  couldnt read all of that post. i just kinda brushed through it bc it has now triggered me. um ye ex is a fucking douche bag and he can go fuck himself for doing this to u. as well as the person who wrote this post. i cant believe how fucking ugly people are to mentally ill people. this is fucking disgusting. i am so sorry u went through this, love. nobody should feel like a villian. i get how u feel bc this is my biggest fear. somebody viewing me like this post is. im so sorry and i hope u feel better soon."
BPD,fpa6axu,t3_gcagq8,1588441687.0,"i understand. i dont go to therapy rn because of this situation and also because of money. i like my therapist hes really cool but he doesnt really help me. ive seen him on and off for like 5 years and i havent made much progress. i dont know whta to do i cant find another therapist, i live in a third world country many therapists suck here and also theres not many of them anyways because i live in kind of a small towm. i totally get what ur going through. if you cant communicate right with ur therapist if ur not comfortable, then i think its not right and u shouldnt continue. its hard to understand for ur parents but ur going to waste even more money and ur time if u continue even though it doesnt help u. hope u feel better soon"
BPD,fpa4bfb,t3_gca582,1588440535.0,i feel this so hard. i hope you feel better soon ❤️
BPD,fowh549,t1_fowfrgo,1588119677.0,yeah i finally realized that it wouldnt be good for us to get back together. we are just different people. thank you so much!!
BPD,foqflep,t1_foqf6pc,1587992393.0,i cant rlly explain now but the fact that kinda everyone knew and i didnt just makes me feel like shit and just deepens my anxiety that i cant do this job and i need to quit but i cant do that right now. im so fucking scared i just dont want to be mentally ill anymore i just need help and i cant get it. idk what to do im having a panic attack rn. i keep zoning out and at times nothing feels real but then my anxiety just spikes idk
BPD,fopq40p,t1_foo70fi,1587968553.0,yeah i feel like i always get shut down with that comment: oh ur quirky. i told a few people in my life i dont want to live a normal or long life and so many of them just said oh well that sucks cuz ur gonna have to. i just think thats sad. i think its sad everything we do in our young years is prepping so we live as comfortably possible later when u cant do shit basically. and thats only if ur lucky. if ur not ur basically going to fight to survive all ur life. theres a deeper issue here and its the system and how society opearates but i cant change it alone and all i see is people being complicit and making peace with the establishment which i just cant do ive tried.
BPD,foppqj3,t1_foonb7m,1587968231.0,im guessing u probably dont want people telling you they are sorry or something. i get your point of view and would probably do the same.
BPD,foppll8,t1_fopgry5,1587968115.0,yeah me neither. just seems not possible.
BPD,fonbn0p,t1_fon3efy,1587916345.0,thank you i totally get what you mean. i just feel like ill experience everything by the time im 35. thank you though i hope we both end up living lives we want to be living. ❤️
BPD,fon0zh3,t3_g896vx,1587909630.0,"yes this happens every time i talk to someone. but then also due to my experience with this and other bad experiences, i started developing huge trust issues when someone shows the same interest in me bc im scared theyre going to manipulate me or do something bad to me idk. also i can feel literally IN LOVE with a person within days and then ill scare myself with that feeling and start dissociating bc i know it will end up sour. and then i just dont wanna talk to them at all i get scared of them its very tearing and idk how to get to the middle."
BPD,fo862vr,t1_fo839qo,1587590555.0,they put a trigger warning and maybe they just wanted someone to reply? sometimes u get no replies. and also some people dont have access to therapy due to many reasons. i agree that therapy is very important but u should keep that in mind.
BPD,fo7rli7,t1_fo7judv,1587583342.0,dude what kind of reply is this? they are seeking support so what if theyre posting in more subs?
BPD,fo7r7m1,t3_g67432,1587583152.0,yep all the time
BPD,fo7m678,t1_fo7k8dg,1587580700.0,thank u for sharing. i do feel pretty alone and like i am the only one feeling like this so its super comforting to hear from people who feel the same. yeah i dont know how im going to do it i hope it will be ok. i am not on meds of any kind and i dont really know what meds are used for bpd. i sometimes think i need them even though as a child/early teen i was fed pills by many psyhiatrists and i dont think it was the right thing to do back then. (im 19 now) but sometimes i would just like to u know be able to function in life. do meds work for you?
BPD,fo779gb,t1_fo743cv,1587573466.0,thank you. i have a lot of shit going on right now.
BPD,fo6t5x3,t1_fo6qpdc,1587566248.0,thank you. i mean i have my own therapist but i havent seen him in like three months bc i didnt have money and because again i thought i was better and didnt need help. i mean i dont really know how to get better dont know what to do when my mood switches and i get suicidal. i just let it happen and let it consume me. idk it gets really hard espcially bc people dont understand how hard my mental ilness really is. thank you tho. i work a similar job actually. 😊 hope youre doing well

BPD,fo3xhby,t3_g5d26x,1587494606.0,"i am so sorry that this happened you dont deserve this no matter what he says no matter what anybody says. it wasnt your fault you are not disgusting for this happening to you. please try to reach out to someone, im not sure where you live but i hope there are resources that can help you or maybe someone you can trust. please know you are worth so much more than this! stay strong and please try to get help as soon as possible. ❤️❤️❤️❤️ sending you lots of love."
BPD,fo3w3lh,t3_g5d3l9,1587493927.0,"im sort of on the road to that. i basically cut off my 2 friends i most hung out these past 6 months because they really dont get me or my problems that stem form bpd but also stuff that doesnt really have to do with that (i.e my shitty living and financial situation). also i had a best friend of 4 years but recently i sensed that it was coming to an end and he found better, cooler friends (he moved for college) and he has a gf and everything. about 7 days something happened i tried to reach out to him, he left me on read. when that happened i kind of just X-ed him in my brain. had a very complicated relationship with my ex, he kind of led my on after i said i still love him and it was very complicated. we were friends i was still comfortable with him. about also 7 days ago i saw him on tinder and realized he really doesnt love me like that anymore. i X-ed him out. i basically have one good friend that really understands me bc she has bpd as well but shes busy and she got her life together (so proud of her!!) and i dont want to bother her. so yeah, im kind of on the road to becoming a loner. i am just sick of the ripping horrible feeling i have when i try to have a normal relationship with someone. plus nobody fucking cares enough to try to understand someone with this disorder. i mean on  the one hand i understand and i dont blame them, but on the other i am angry at them. i basically just talk to my family bc i live with them and a guy i met on tinder and idk how long thats gonna last. its hard for me because i am an extrovert i love people i love to hang out with them. but they hurt me so bad."
BPD,fo3u7t8,t3_g5f1in,1587493027.0,i would probably leave it there.
BPD,fo3ss4l,t3_g5ixzp,1587492353.0,"LEAVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. he is abusive this is not a healthy relationship at all. you need to leave him once and for all block him on everything, cut off all contact. you deserve better than to be treated like shit every fucking day. i hope youre safe and that you will make the right choice."
BPD,fo3bavf,t3_g5gpfz,1587483944.0,"well its kind of like what you explained. i also want to talk to someone like mostly when i have an episode and most ppl i talk to (well used to talk to now) dont get it or dont care enough to try. so i feel worse and decide im never talking to them again until i do, except this last time i rlly just said i dont wanna do it anymore. so yeah its mostly the same like it is for you."
BPD,fo26n8a,t1_fo194xx,1587451412.0,i wish u all the best ❤️
BPD,fo0lv6e,t3_g4xle6,1587415466.0,yeah i think i do that too
BPD,fo0lez1,t3_g50chk,1587415238.0,"i think that definitely this relationship had many mistakes and that a you both made mistakes and done wrong things. i feel that because that happened to me also in my last relationship. we both totally did things that were bad. we also tried being friends. and i must say that sometimes yes that does work (im best friends with my first girlfriend, well now ex gf) if enough time passes and if there arent feelings still involved. you should use those experiences to be better and its hard its hard as fuck for me. i only hope we can all do better in the future. hope ur doing ok"
dating_advice,fnyuttf,t3_g4pr23,1587376503.0,"yeah i would drop him probably. i mean yes he is busy and i can understand that. however, he cant make time for u at all? 30 minutes? i mean its quarantine and yes he still has school but we all have a lot of time on our hands now. i mean that line about u not being a priority, thats pretty telling. i feel like its better to kind of give him space and see where it goes. but i totally think he lost interest or something like that. hope everything works out for you ❤️"
