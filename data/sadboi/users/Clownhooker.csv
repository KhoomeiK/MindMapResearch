depression,fqdsmsz,t3_gicaac,1589295885.0,Life is about the struggle. We all live in this river and fight against this current. Having different strategies and coping mechanisms doesn’t have to be daunting it’s a plan. Unplanned people are Boring. And don’t look at your sexuality as a burden but a flavor indicator.

depression,fqdraud,t3_gicar8,1589295222.0,"First things first. Everyone fails. And this quarantine situation has been wholly disruptive for EVERYONE, even little granny’s whole didn’t have jobs. Give yourself a break! If your moms upset, that is her emotion, you can’t help her with that. You like math and science so let’s deal with facts. Fact: you were amazingly enrolled is school and work and surviving. 
Fact: A WORLD PANDEMIC CAME AND SHUT THE WORLD DOWN
Fact: Because of this your school work suffers because you suffered. 
You might not be in touch with your peers as much but I can imagine they are suffering too. There is a voice inside our head dubbed our “inner-critic”, this is that nasty voice that tells us we’re not good enough, or that we could be doing more. I know mine has been going CRAZY during quarantine. From telling me I should be making meal for homeless, to why don’t I have a job yet (it’s not safe). Sometimes you just have to sit back and talk to this critical voice and say. I’m doing the best that I can right now piss off!  

I really hope this helps

depression,fq9ogz0,t3_ghmswl,1589203607.0,"As someone who has suffered with multiple types of depression you definitely sound like you are officially depressed. The difference between just plain sadness and depression is that prolonged, vague feeling about it. Now this doesn’t necessarily mean that you should run out for a script of antidepressants (although I get quite a bit of relief from them). Start learning coping strategies for stress and anxiety. DBT therapy is highly recommend and gets some good results. Think of this like a 12 step (alcoholic) thing. First you identify the problem, and you admit you(alone without help) are powerless to fight against it. Secondly Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves (therapy’s- and the help of others) could restore us to sanity.

The main thing is to ask for help in an honest way and no one will turn you away (and anyone who would you can go ahead and cut them out). 

I hope this helps

When you find yourself scared and crying calm yourself like you would like a loving parent to do.

Secondly, start setting some boundaries and sticking to them. No one knows how to treat you unless you tell them. This goes for good and bad. If you really don't like being hugged from behind ”can you please not do that” is clear enough to state a boundary. But also if you really like it when they sing ”you should sing more it makes you soul shine” is a positive way to make your intentions clear.   Once those rules of engagement are out and in play feelings get hurt less and if they do I find it easier to excuse myself, get upset, calm myself, and then explain to the other person why.

It gets easier, it's finding ways to take our emotionally introverted selves and make them a little more accessible.

**Edit**: rereading the post I may have missed the major point of the post. Step 2 for me is ”let go let ”god”’  (whatever good means to you). I was a MAJOR controller when I first started my journey until one realizes that you can't control SHIT!  Especially what others do/think/feel. All I can do is control what is in my circle of influence me, my dog, my house, sometimes not even that. All I can control is how I react to that. My friend can in with a good say ”That’s your taco you eat it” much like ”not my monkey not my circus”  you op in on everyone's drama if you know it or not. An exercise for a week is to see how many times you have to ”let go and let god” or ”give back their tacos”"

That way I don't have to think about what games I own. Also I get to cycle out that way I very rarely complete a game but apparently in a depression I have defeated 3 so far. The act of clearing missions is peaceful. I may not have a handle on the world outside of the controller, but my missions are on point and I have all the loot!"
oddlysatisfying,fcw6k57,t1_fcvblnc,1578018309.0,My dad actually work around window tinting and car wrapping all day (he been in luxery car stereo systems and modifications for the past 40 years). This is the short cut way. You can do it this way but you will scratch/score your paint but it will be years before you realize it so no one has be fussing. You are supposed to cut it off the car just like tint. Could you imagine scoring the shit out of someones new lambo just so you would make it pink zibra stripes it some shit.
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fcw0yfv,t3_ej4zls,1578014615.0,"Cheese warning: in grateful for Reddit and the 6+ years I have in it. We are a odd bunch of weirdos that are really are really smart and kind and some of the greatest people I have ever interacted with. Sometimes the act of truly being anonymous allows us to show the world who we want to be, good or bad. 
That is one of the things I always find so fascinating about being a clown. You become anonymous and infamous at the same time. People attach their image of a clown to you and you are that clown instead of who you are. 

I think it's the same here we get to shed our identities not even an icon. But some of the words and the connections I have had with these people not to mention the few that I have had the honor to meet in real life have blown me away. 

I am grateful I am a Redditor. In all of is internet underground awesomeness."

toastme,fcvwm12,t3_ej427l,1578011754.0,Staying clean in hard times is a feat! You are strong 💪 You are also beautiful you have the skin and hair that I have always wished for. I don't know if it was all for something but as a fellow sober person it's impressive as hell.
LifeProTips,fcryz1u,t3_eidrgg,1577908651.0,As a bipolar who is currently suffering this is too true for me. I swear I must have been a cat in my last life as hard as it is for me to get in the show but once in there it feels so good I understand why people have 45-minute ones. Might not work for everyone but in on your team.

toastme,fcoeqfu,t3_ei8mll,1577830451.0,"As someone who is also struggling with depression, I feel you on that front. I also had my hopefully one and only stent in the hospital, it was terrible I came out so much worse then when I went in. I will never share my suicidal thoughts ever again. That being said I share this Sisyphus like feeling. Life does get better** you are a beautiful young man. It honestly doesn't matter what you want to do or where you want to go you could fake it till you made it.** You may lose friends along the way but you will make more and they will be closer to what you value. And guess what one day this Sisyphus feeling is going to come back and you'll have to remember all this again. Which is where I am at 35 am lost. 
You don't have to make all the decisions today. Live one day at a time. It will add up to a great life."

toastme,fcodc0k,t3_ei8u7y,1577829458.0,Confidence is easily won and lost self-compassion is making a friend with yourself. Once you do that you can treat our friend-self better we would normally treat ourselves. You have a beautiful smile and I hope your life is filled will wonderfully trusting people. You deserve to be happy.
