I let her stay up a little longer to play but also to monitor her lol and she seems better. She hasn’t grabbed or scratched at the area and was running around, playing with her toys, and even sat with one leg straight and sitting on the leg I was worried about. Kind of like pretzel style but one leg out. 

The RN from my daughter’s pediatric line said pretty much the same thing. Since there aren’t any further symptoms, she isn’t worried, but if things do progress negatively to go into an urgent care. I hope we don’t end up going that route, but I won’t freak out anymore!"

I remember being so mad at her on her last day. She even decided to be with another student that day, which got me upset. She would always work with me, but she was with someone else. I was angry, crying, and out of control. She eventually came to be with me but told me my behavior was unacceptable and she isn’t just my teacher, she’s everyone’s, but understood that I would miss her since it was her last day.
