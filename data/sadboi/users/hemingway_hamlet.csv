I’m currently trying to learn more about this. Here’s an article explaining the concept: https://themighty.com/2019/09/echoism-narcissistic-parent/

I also find Tim Fletchers videos on YouTube about CPTSD to be helpful.

The book ‘Healing your ptsd: dynamic strategies that work’ is a really good resource. 

I’ve heard of the book - ‘CPTSD: From surviving to thriving’ by Pete Walker; it has very good reviews but I haven’t been able to pick up a copy yet. Also planning on reading ‘The Empaths Survival Guide: life strategies for sensitive people’ by Judith Orloff and ‘Emotional Sensitivity and Intensity: how to manage intense emotions’ by Imi Lo. Hoping these books will be helpful too. 

It’s really tough being an hsp and having our backgrounds. Incredibly unbelievably  tough."

I actually found someone who treated me and finally gave me relief for 6 weeks at least. But then I went back to my normal life and the pain came back and nothing has been working since, for a whole year 😔 no prayer is working. I’m sure it was punishment for something and because I didn’t learn Allâh continued the punishment. My health has deteriorated so much in so many ways since then.

The last 2 I have been embroiled in health problems after a car accident, and at one point I was so sick I thought I was actually going to die, and I remember just being disgusted with everything I owned, all my possessions, what a waste it all was, and all I thought about that mattered in this world were my parents and him - all I wanted before I died was to be able to say goodbye to them. It sounds dramatic, but it kind of drove it home how much I cared about him if he's the last thing I think of before I die. In today's world, romance, true love, or genuine soul connection or anything like that is dead, so I just sound weak, sentimental, and stupid, I'm aware.  

Thank you very much for your very kind words. He was insecure as well, but I feel like we could have worked these things out or our insecurities would have decreased with time. I try to think it wasn't our fate to be together, or there were worse things about him which would have come out much later, which helps a little, but still feels hollow.

I have to be so cautious for every new person, that I end up losing people who actually are genuine compassionate sincere human beings. And the negative effects of narcs are so intense and all-encompassing, it takes me months to years to recover every time I encounter one. It's a ridiculous waste of life. I'm sorry you've been through the same thing, it's extremely painful, so I understand. I'm glad you escaped your narc ex though, and I escaped that narc guy as well.

LifeAfterNarcissism,fo15mtj,t1_fo0wol4,1587426237.0,"Thanks for the sound advice. I was actually good about this and hadn't looked at their social media for several years - I had blocked them and gotten rid of my own social media to prevent myself from going there. It's just been a bad couple of months for me, so I kind of broke down and looked. I had actually really liked the narc's brother, he wasn't a narc and one of the nicer people I have ever met, and was just feeling sad so looked him up. The narc had of course sabatoged everything with me and the brother at the time because it was geniune and I can understand now he can never have anything geniune so was envious of it. I know I shouldn't look and do feel empathy for her if she's truly being abused, but it's just part of a how a narc makes you feel - if I had been more like her or not done anything wrong, I would've ended up with the perfect horse and carriage wedding and decorating my beautiful home like she is. I know it's just a false image with something unhappy behind it, but sometimes when you're down you end up going to those thoughts. I have a narc family who have done the same thing to me in any case in this time (i.e. abuse), so it would've just been trading one narc for another, maybe it wouldn't have been as bad, who knows. Anyway, you're right, I will stop looking and thinking about them altogether. Thank you."

A Chinese real estate agent I had ended up advising a seller I was trying to buy from to raise their price and sell to someone else and make more profit (also illegal for her to do, to advise and benefit someone who wasn't her client at the expense of her client just because I wasn't Chinese). They definitely have a strong sense of patriotism/community tied to the socialist narrative maybe, missing in Pakistan. They will scam the heck out of anyone who is not of their own community though. 

I noticed Eastern European people help out their own people as well - if in a hiring position, they only hire there own people. The people are extremely intelligent and competent too, but they seem to prefer to hire their own. Persians also do a lot for their own people, even though I  haven't had the best experiences with them personally. But they consider their own people first as well. 

The Indian community also definitely looks out for their own, they share information and try to get their own people into the best academic programs etc. They prepare and share information as a community.

They will literally make exceptions and find loopholes, ways out, etc. to help their own people that are struggling. I saw Chinese millionaires buy apartments just to rent them extremely low cost to poor Chinese students studying in foreign countries - making no profit when they could have easily rented to others and made a profit. 

In Pakistani culture, on the other hand, they will actively sabotage and are only happy once you are miserable. Forget helping others in the community, people will literally sabotage their own blood brother and sister out of jealousy. It's a self-hating culture."
MuslimLounge,fn52ivs,t3_fz6a0q,1586654385.0," “There is no heart that does not have clouds like the clouds that cover the moon. When the cloud covers it, it is dark, and when the cloud moves away it shines.” 

Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Awsat, and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. 

So the believer’s heart is sometimes covered with a cloud and its light is hidden, and it remains dark and lonely, but if he strives to increase his store of faith and seeks the help of Allaah, that cloud goes away and the light in his heart starts to shine again. Hence one of the salaf said: “It is part of a person’s smartness to c heck on his faith and be aware of what affects it.” It is also part of a person’s smartness “that he recognizes how the Shaytaan whispers to him.”"
CPTSD,fn50ncu,t1_fn507i8,1586653155.0,"They don’t get your brain is actually damaged from emotional abuse and neglect, and as a result you can’t grow up yourself and make healthy choices. My mom tells me to get over it all the time, to “move on”, and there’s nothing more infuriating. We basically have to deconstruct our whole identity, discover all the disfunction and rebuild ourselves from scratch - all when we’re already adults and losing time."
CPTSD,fn4zl8z,t3_fze1am,1586652466.0,"Exactly the same situation here, you just basically described my parents. It’s the most unfair thing in the world to never have had a chance and be destined to struggle and suffer in life just by being born to them."
AskReddit,fn25pct,t1_fn1wqk2,1586578562.0,That’s a fetch story
raisedbynarcissists,fn1l9n8,t1_fn12uas,1586564420.0,Me too :( I lost someone I really liked because of these thoughts. It’s actually like psychological torture.
CPTSD,fn0zaem,t3_fymy1y,1586551671.0,"Yes, I understand. I lose self esteem like crazy around healthy people, can't even speak half the time."
raisedbynarcissists,fn0ydhf,t3_fyggvw,1586551161.0,"I wish I'd heard this advice much, much earlier.  When I asked my mother for advice about someone pursuing me, all I got was, ""Are you sure you're not imagining someone liking you? It's probably your imagination."" and, ""No one handsome and successful will ever want someone like you."" But I was foolish enough to believe it. Still can't get her voice out of my head whenever I meet someone."
MuslimLounge,fn0ww43,t1_fmz7tou,1586550334.0,Thank you. It's still difficult for me to understand but this gave me some comfort.
AskReddit,fmyt9a3,t1_fmyt1re,1586495080.0,Of course you can.
MuslimLounge,fmyq5bb,t1_fmypqzf,1586492528.0,Why wouldn’t they? They are Muslim’s and don’t sin. I sin more than they do due to my difficult life - I get tired and lose my faith sometimes.

Soulnexus,fmu3q4a,t3_fxery7,1586384004.0,"This makes sense, as the same thing keeps happening over and over again in my life, but I have no idea how to solve it or what it is telling me. It’s extremely confusing. I feel like I’m not smart enough to read or understand Gods signs."
