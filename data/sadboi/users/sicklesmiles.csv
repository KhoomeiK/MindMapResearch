Actually I've been baking a lot lately and it's been really fun. I'm thinking of baking a key lime pie next-- what about you?"

If you need a mother's validation, but have a crap mom irl, the people on that sub will be there for you in your time of need-- was thinking about using it myself."
lonely,feskhd6,t3_eqfxso,1579366183.0,"I feel like I'm always waiting for that inevitability. People pass through my life like wind through tall grass that once ceased leaves no trace of itself. I feel the movements and mourn the loss, but by persistent inadequance cannot bring them to stay. I'm too fucked... I've too much in my head that I can't keep hidden for longer than a few days.

 Last night I woke up my boyfriend at 5:30 am, on a work day, after waking panicked over a nightmare. My nightmares are severe, and after having one I usually suffer from bouts of insomnia for several days as I'm afraid to sleep again. He told me he wasn't tired at all. He told me he loved me and wanted to be there for me. He offered to stay awake and watch a movie with me so I wouldn't have to be awake alone. With every affection I paced equal in loathing. I couldn't believe I'd been so selfish, again, after days of panic attacks followed by dissociation, all of which he witnessed, uncertain of what was happening or if I'd come back.  

It'll all be fine until it isn't. Suddenly I've slipped sideways through a crack into hell, and I can't get out. Meanwhile my loved ones stand around me calling me back home, tears in their eyes. So I just stayed silent, and eventually he fell back to sleep.

And I don't know how long I can do this to them before they just have to leave, like the ones before them. Everyone goes eventually. And I know when they go the loneliness I feel at their backs turned away, I deserve."

Heat oven to 450 f, rinse chickpeas, pat dry, toss with oil and spices (I'd recommend a decent amount of salt, whatever combo you end up using) and roast them for 20-22 minutes. Super tasty, and a great way to get rid of a can if you bought too many üëç"

I'm personally welcome to and extremely grateful for the odd person who'll just hear you out, y'know, maybe even reply with something from the heart. It's just not the typical response to expressing depression or suicidal ideations."
