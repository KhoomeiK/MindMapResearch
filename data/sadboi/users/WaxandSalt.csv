It feels like more of natural stimulation. Stims have a kinda dirty and synthetic energy. With PCP its more like that stimulation is from inside you, like from a source you have just discovered, an animal strength. In body, spirit and mind. It makes me giddy and happy when I feel it. 

I've done too much a couple times, the first I just kept taking smallish doses occasionally for 2 days. I ended up not sleeping for like 5 days. It was really difficult crazy crazy fucked up incident.

Second time I snorted probably 50-60 mgs by mistake. I blacked out in minutes and don't remember anything at all, but roommates say I was having seizure like movements while making weird noises (my friend said I looked like I was possesse) and i was non responsive so they called  an ambulance.

I was laid on my bed by the EMTs told my friends to just make sure I was breathing. I woke up the next day feeling refreshed with that PCP after glow. 12/10 would not do again.

I'm thinking maybe get the heat up a bit, and try a sandy substrate instead. Maybe try outside the dome. Hopefully that will get the rooting time down. Now it takes  6-10 weeks to root.

I have rooted around 15-20 plants the last year using the above method. I would take more but I got a fairly small plant to clone off, I can only do 4-6 cutting each go round for now.

The great thing is it makes cannabis so much more effective and enjoyable ( smoking less weed, that is) Cannabis is definitely not for every one. And a lot of people don't like kratom, its makes some people I know very ill when they took it. 

I just don't feel that people should be comparing different ethno botanicals and saying one is better than the other. Some people are helped with shrooms or MDMA,  where as MDMA just makes me clench my jaw and feel a lot of anxiety. But if that's what helps that's what helps.
