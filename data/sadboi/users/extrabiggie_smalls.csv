AskReddit,eq1oegi,t1_epyj6yx,1559714794.0,Cheers man!
AskReddit,epy5rms,t3_bw9z5r,1559620324.0,That i'm an actual 1 on a scale of 1 to 10.
AskMen,epqmm6t,t1_epn7uq4,1559408565.0,Exactly. But i think i would be miserable even if i just stayed a few months more.
bikewrench,epqmjk2,t1_epn8guv,1559408524.0,Is there morethan one claris crankset? All i know is the 2by claris. I have much to really learn.

bikewrench,epdunl5,t1_epb9y9m,1559174254.0,Yeah i did. Hahaha. Can't ride it with a bent fork. It'll look like a tom and jerry cartoon.

AskReddit,epahqya,t3_bu9n61,1559128203.0,Monica geller. Especially in season 5. Damn that curly hair with blue eyes.
bikewrench,epagqq5,t1_epae482,1559127751.0,Yep. Lesson learned. Haha  thanks man!
bikewrench,epac1o0,t1_epa3ydo,1559125533.0,Looks like it. It's like the pedal itself skips a bit each rotation.
bikewrench,ep9ybhc,t1_ep9qrrm,1559118447.0,"It wasn't a big box bike tbh. It was one of the local manufacturers here in the PH. Being that it it's still cheap, the QC might be what's at fault here."
bikewrench,ep9y60a,t1_ep97rbe,1559118363.0,The pedal felt like it was riding on a speed bump for each rotation it makes. I thought it was the pedals that is the problem. Turned out that it was the crank arm itself.
bikewrench,ep9y1qm,t1_ep93e6a,1559118300.0,Yeah it's a beater. I will do a thorough check up once i get all the components that i want to replace. Heck ileven the cog has play in it. I mean it kinda helps when track standing but i need to save up to atleast a shimano claris and proper cog drivetrain setup.
bikewrench,ep9xvt8,t1_ep8t8mz,1559118206.0,"Yeah. It literally could have. I just wanted to have a bike to commute with and with a fixie having the least amount of components and is quite reliable that's the route i took. A friend of mine had a used fixie with a bent fork so i decided to grab the opportunity to take it off from him for cheap. Rebuilt it with even cheaper components that i thought would do since i'm not riding hardcore anymore, still it failed. 

I have very little to no budget at all since i just needed it to work. But now i'm realizing that reliability comes from better components as few as they are."
