thedoors,fr111ge,t3_glr9pr,1589811143.0,"I think it’s more a matter of the time The Doors music came out. 

In general I suspect more people are afraid to try new things out these days (and I don’t just mean record companies). 
Just look at the state of the majority of popular music these days compared to then! Subjective to taste to some extent but there are some objective facts that point to a lot of music being comparatively rubbish these days. Just lazy in their investment to saying something with their art.

Perhaps being an artist in the true sense today means more than it did back in the 60’s/70’s. Maybe one has to not only be more of an outsider than they were back then but also be comfortable in that place. 
So they can  through their art more than ever before fight that fear to put themselves out there.

There’s no denying that the popular mindset these days may be thinking more in terms of opinion; that’s great to some extent, but opinions aren’t as important as facts."

ToolBand,fhzia5a,t1_fhzhv1z,1582000279.0,"Thanks for clarifying; I was reasonably objectively sure it wasn’t an attack. It just felt like one; that’s my problem, not yours. 
There’s my wee issues creeping in and I’m recognising it when it happens. 
This is a moment when usually until a month and a half ago I would grab the bottle.

That’s great you can recognise the problem and your life has been better for leaving alcohol out of it. It’s never easy to recognise immediately what needs to change. Good for you!

That’s so sweet of you, thank you. I wish the same for you. 😊❤️"
ToolBand,fhzhklv,t1_fhzg9js,1581999733.0,"Fine to be curious, even if it feels like an attack initially, I’ll see past that, not take it personally, and respect your curiosity.

The benefit of reintroducing alcohol back into my life is that it’s fun to have a drink or more and not get absolutely sloshed. 
I’m never going to be the sort of guy who does nothing more than sit down with a cup of camomile tea and read a book. It’s just not who I am, nor do I wish to be that person. No disrespect to our full time camomile drinking readers out there. 

Drinking responsibly has always worked fine for me; I’d go as far as to say I’ve benefitted from it.  
It’s more in the last few years in particular it became a problem because I had an inner drive urging me to ignore what was going on inside of me: trauma. 
I have since removed the inner drive to drink to the point of being paralytic, blackout drunk. I didn’t go to AA; I just stopped. So it shows that I have control. It’s one thing to stop cold turkey, it’s another to have control of any addiction, with the catalyst of that addiction still present in your life in moderation.

Does that answer your questions?"
