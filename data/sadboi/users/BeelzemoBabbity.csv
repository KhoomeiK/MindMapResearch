At oceans of fun, there is a big pool with floats of animals chained to the bottom that you can climb on, which are really slippery, and take quite a bit of practice to get onto, and stay onto. The pool gradually gets deeper as it goes back, from ankle depth, to covering my head (I was short). 

My mom had taken me and my older sister to the pool, and met up with her friend there. Her friend had a young daughter, maybe 5 years old, and we were all swimming when we decided to go to the deep end. The moms were talking, and my sister and the girl were playing on a float. The floats can be really slippery, and the girl fell off. I didnt do anything at first, since I assumed her mom would help her, but then the girl started to struggle. Going slightly under and panicking. 

Side note. I couldnt touch in this water,(by a just bit) so to get around I would do this thing where I went under and pushed off the bottom to jump up a bit for air. 

Now, I was panicking because I didnt want this girl to drown, so I grabbed her. She latched onto me around my sholders, and I tried to get over to her mom to get her attention, but no one was paying attention. At this point I was starting to panic because I couldnt touch and was getting tired. I was convinced I would drown and barely made my way to my mom and lached onto her. I dont remember what happened after very well though. We were both fine though. 

Funnily enough one of my other scary experiences were that same pool where me and my sister went down a slide into such unexpectedly deep water that we paniced and almost drowned."
AskReddit,fq4wek8,t3_g88ccd,1589085812.0,"I wasn't technically home alone, per say, but my mom had come home to our apartment, drunk late at night and fallen asleep in her room. About an hour later, there was knocking at the door. I knew not to open the door so i went to wake up my mom. No matter how hard I tried I couldnt get her to really listen to me, (because she was drunk) and only responded with dismissal like ""I dont care"" or ""let them"" (she was drunk and half asleep). But the knocking continued, more aggresively. So being afraid, I gave up on waking my mom after several tries and went back to my room. Suddenly there was knocking at the living room window, I plugged my headphones in and tried to drown it out. Then my moms window, and finally mine. I sat in a ball covered in a blanket blaring my headphones in my ears at full volume. Eventually I fell asleep, and the next day I find out that it was my mom's boyfriend who had come home from the bar a little after my mom trying to get in because he didnt have a key."
StardewValley,eragw10,t3_aef3x0,1560643641.0,"I mostly fished in my first year and explored the game, plant the seeds you get (parsnips I,think?) Because they grow fast and level you up. Just make enough to buy lots of blue berries in summer, they made me like 10,000, more than that tho, you get about 2 to 3 crops of it so do lots of those, then plant cranberries in fall. In winter forage and plant winter seeds."

namethesong,eq5t8nd,t3_aiw5m8,1559813491.0,"If it was in a video, try to describe it. If you know the meaning of the song, try that too. If you remember what language it was in, or the music genere that also help a lot. Just list out everything you can remember. You may not find an answer fast, but it increases your chances by a lot. Post it here."

LostSongsTeam,epvmagd,t3_bw711y,1559539678.0,I also remember a comment of the video having to describe what was happening since it had no captions. So i assume it was very obscure.
