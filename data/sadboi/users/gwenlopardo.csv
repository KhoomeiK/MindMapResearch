AskReddit,f8vbwts,t1_f8uja4k,1574865597.0,"why would it be looked down upon? it’s 2019 women and men have the same role now especially if they are younger parents. maybe older generations will judge you/your choices but your kids and wife will not. the father and child relationship is so important and having the dad able able to spend that much time with the kids let alone the whole day would be awesome for a lot of families. 

from personal experience: i make much more than my husband so if the time had to come where one of us had to stop working it would definitely be him. our son is best and most comfortable with me but i know that once a routine was set everything would be fine and adjusted. my husband family is a stereotypical family of the man and woman role so there have been times where we have seen our different parenting styles become present when we take about work and childcare- but it’s your life, your wife, your child. just make sure you ALL are happy and everything will be fine"
