Anxiety,flje6fe,t3_fnz5n3,1585208718.0,"I'm scared. I'm sorry I know there was something about venting in the rules but my brain won't process that many words right now I'm sorry if I shouldn't vent here but I'm scared and I am pretending I'm not scared because a lot of people look up to me and expect me to stay calm and I just need to write it somewhere. I'm really scared. I don't even know of what. I don't really think I'll get it, though I have asthma so I guess it might be bad if I did. I think I'm more scared of the fact that if someone I care about gets it, I can't visit them. What if they die alone. My dad is a 59 y o doctor and 4 doctors in his practice are quarantined and being tested and another tested positive. Patients at his hospital are dying from this. What if he gets it and I can never see him again? He was meant to walk me down the aisle in October at my wedding. My last surviving grandmother is 90 and her dog literally JUST died on Friday and now she is all alone, we are in California and locked down and even if we weren't everyone is too scared to visit her because what if we are silent carriers? She would die from this. I talk to her on the phone and I can tell she wants to cry, she is all alone. And everyone keeps saying how the world is not going to go back to how it was and I don't know what that means for us all. I am so scared I am so scared of everything happening right now I just want things to go back to how they were a few weeks ago, I can't believe this went so bad so fast. I'm scared. I'm sorry if I broke a rule I'm sorry I'm sorry"
Anxiety,fl3hd5y,t3_fkq88w,1584784021.0,"Yes. My fianc√© and I are both in the entertainment industry in California, which has now essentially gone dark for the foreseeable future. It's already such an unstable industry but we had done such a good job these past couple of years, saving up and finally starting to feel like we were in a good place. We started planning our wedding since we can now afford one (we've been together for almost a decade), and after facing so many hardships in our early 20s (really sudden and tragic family death a few years ago, plus a myriad of little losses both personal and professional, overdraft bank accounts, etc) we felt like.... I dunno, like FINALLY it was time for us to start our lives together and leave all that struggle behind us. But now... are we even going to be able to have a wedding? Will we both be able to make any money if the entire structure of the industry changes and we are deemed unnecessary? Are we going to have to basically start all over? Is everything we worked toward up until now just... useless? How long can the studios we work for survive this...? I'm not scared of dying from this. I'm scared of living through whatever happens next."
