The main jist of what I taught was that you need to take more notice of the world around you. We spend nearly 50% of our life thinking about the future/past instead of focusing on the present which is important and what we live in. You need to start teaching yourself to stop dwelling on the past and being anxious about the future. You can do this with meditation, teaching your mind not to wander too far with breathing and focusing on what you hear/feel when you do it. (*Headspace* is an app that we used to recommend to people. I've tried it myself, but it's not for me.)

You can do mindfulness activities if meditation isn't for you; drawing or colouring in for adults is a good place to start if you don't do well with meditation. Going for walks is an easy one. Just breathing and taking in the world in the present.

Honestly, there are a lot of books on it. You can teach yourself and your mind to be more resilient and present. It's in your hands. I hope this helps! (It's been a while since I've taught it)."

I’m in this same boat with my own sister. She never showed love for me growing up, we fought physically a lot and she made an effort to exclude me and make me feel bad. She was my older sister, supposed to protect me. When I was getting beaten up at school, she never made an effort to help or support me but made it worse by bullying me at home.

Several times in our adult lives we’ve fallen out and made hollow apologies. She says to my parents she wants a relationship, but she lost all of that chance when she purposefully triggered my CPTSD and made me regress in my therapy. Every so often we fight and ‘make up’, I tried to fix things by trying to have a ‘talk’ — but she refused once I told her she might hear things she might not like.

Now, we just have a relationship of ‘we’re family, but I don’t like you’. You could possibly just have that with your sister, but its your choice entirely. I hate pretending with my sister, I wish I loved her, but there’s nothing there anymore. We barely have love for each other, but I keep things civil for the sake of her kids.

Do you want to cut her off? Do you want to pretend and put on a face for the family? Ultimately at the end of the day, you have no obligation to forgive her. It’s your decision, as an adult, Just recognise the fallout this will cause for the people in your family you love. They may take your sisters side or try to attempt an intervention for you both. I suggest having a good long think about this before you take your next step. Perhaps take this to a therapist who specialises in this area?

Being able to get a car, pass a theory and driving test means **you are qualified and responsible enough to drive a car.** If you choose to abuse this responsibility and break the law, then you should be punished for it. 18 is old enough to know not to get into a car drunk, because he is old enough to respect the law, have a car and pay insurance.

What if he'd hit and killed someone? That's more life ruining than a DUI, my dude. That's many lives ruined over a death of a loved one. So many things could have happened while he was drunk; he could've hit someone, driven into a building and killed himself, etc. What if he'd made impact with a tree and killed himself? Who's fault would that be? It's not gonna be the trees. 

18 is called an adult age for a reason; after that age, you are tried as an **adult** in court of law and you can go get a full-time job and choose to get a further education. I doubt a DUI at 18 is going to ruin his entire life, he will learn and grow from it. My brother did worse things at 18 and he has a full-time job, a girlfriend and a car. 

If you bail out your kid for doing something very very wrong and life threatening, then that will only make him think: hey, I can do whatever I want because my parents always have my back! 

Drink driving is a serious thing that has killed people. If he'd hit someone, it'd be a totally different story."

AmItheAsshole,f3et1a9,t3_dgshw8,1570885055.0,"YTA. You are totally and utterly ignorant. Your boyfriend has every right to be angry at you, and honestly if my boyfriend did this to me, I'd be angry with him too. The name calling might be a bit much, but he's *angry* with you. You did something so ignorant and patronising to the person you're supposed to love.

***I was a victim of bullying.*** I am 22 years old, a woman, and guess what bullying did to me? I have depression, anxiety and CPTSD. I was beaten up, degraded, told to end my own life, spat on and generally made the butt of everyone's jokes for no reason. I never hurt anyone, or bullied anyone else, it was totally fucking random. And now, as an adult, I am severely traumatised by certain events, triggered by smells, words and sights. It's horrible and you could have no idea what that's like unless you've lived through it.

From your comments, it's totally accurate to say you have no idea what it's like to be traumatised by bullying. Hop on over to the PTSD or CPTSD subreddit and you'll see plenty of people talking about their trauma -- some were bullied like your boyfriend was.

I have a few issues with some of the things you've said here, so it's gonna get long.

>Like what school would allow someone to be targeted that badly and allow it to occur and not intervene for years? At my school if I got called a something like ""slut"" the bully would get an internal suspension. I believe that he feels/thinks that he got badly bullied.

Guess what? Some schools are awful. My school was fully aware of what was happening to me **and they did nothing.** They let it continue under the guise of ""Oh they're just being competitive!"" or ""Oh, they have it rough at home!"" or ""Just get over it."" Some schools are terrible and don't do anything about it. Also, ""believe that he feels/thinks that he got badly bullied.""? **Who the hell are you to decide what didn't or did upset him?** You don't know what he went through and how he felt. He could've gone home every day wanting to end his own life or run away from home because of what happened to him. **You don't know that. You are being ignorant.**

>We're in our mid/late 30s and high school was half our life ago. People grow up and change. I feel it's time to grow out of childish hangups, grudges and rivalries and actually act like an adult and recognise that it's possible for an former ""asshole"" to become decent.

Your boyfriend might've been traumatised by these incidents, and **big surprise,** trauma isn't easy to get over. Trust me, I wish I could move on with my trauma and live a happy life where I can love and trust certain people but it takes **years and years** of therapy to even put these issues on the back burner of your mind and let it simmer. Everyone's brains work differently, and it's possible your boyfriend might still be hurt and upset by these things **and that's okay.** You aren't supporting him and actually **making him feel like his emotions aren't** valid.

And yes while this ex-bully might be a wonderful, charitable, loving person willing to make amends, **your boyfriend does not need to feel obligated to forgive this person if he is not comfortable with it.** Hell, I haven't even forgiven my old bullies. They ruined my childhood and now I have to live with these lifelong traumas because they were stupid kids without any empathy! It will not be easy to get over. So, do not try to make your boyfriend forgive this person when he is uncomfortable, because lets be real: I wouldn't stick around if my boyfriend did this to me. I would dump him on the spot.

>When I brought this up with my boyfriend, he explained how badly bullied he got. According to him the bullying from this coworker and friends made life ""unbearable""

The fact that you put ""unbearable"" in quotation marks here just makes it seem to me that you're not taking him seriously here. This is the nail in the coffin on this post.

You are wilfully ignorant, unempathetic and an asshole in this situation. This is coming from a genuine place, from a fellow victim of bullying. I have genuine disorders because of what happened to me. I feel for your boyfriend in this situation, and it might be hard for him to move on from this because what you did was pretty much unforgivable (at least in my opinion). Until you open your heart a little more and actually listen to your boyfriend, things won't improve from this. I genuinely hope your boyfriend recovers from this."

My question is about your songwriting. How do you guys find your creative flow, and does anything in particular inspire your songs? Any favourite songs of your own?

Also, would you consider returning to the UK to do a solo show? Thank you!!!"

AmItheAsshole,f2xlafh,t3_deij1z,1570479677.0,"I'm really torn on this one and I don't think I can give a straight answer for you. I was a victim of bullying, physical and verbal. I was beaten up every week, and told to kill myself every day. I now have depression, anxiety and CPTSD from it.

Oddly enough, I saw one of my old bullies today and nearly vomited from my panic. I don't know how I would react if they randomly sent me an apology... From my perspective, I'd probably say, ""Thanks for the apology, but the damage is already done."" And leave it at that.

And yes, you likely contributed to her depression and anxiety whether or not you intended it. Kids are cruel and lack empathy, it's just the way things are.

Are you doing this because you want to make yourself feel better, or because you're genuinely remorseful. I would like some more INFO on this."

I will probably have a childfree wedding myself if I ever get married, I'd personally say 16+ is no longer a child and in the realms of young adult. Plus, your kid is going to university. He likely has the maturity to not run around screaming at a reception or cry during the ceremony. You aren't in the wrong here."

I think if you do talk to her about it again, you should explain that everyone’s brains are different and unique. People handle things in different ways, someone might react to the incident you saw badly and develop some sort of trauma from it. But, you probably just dealt with it very well due to the normalisation of growing up in a bad neighbourhood.

If you choose not to get therapy, that’s totally YOUR choice. She doesn’t get to demand what you do or don’t do. I can appreciate her concern seeing as how debilitating PTSD can be, but again, she has a rotten attitude."
