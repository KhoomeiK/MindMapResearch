nfl,fhcopct,t3_f2eml4,1581467474.0,"Played with Trevor Laws who started 4 years at Notre Dame and I  think had 5 years in the league as a DT. Was a second round pick. He was also the #1 heavyweight wrestler in the country for two years straight. 

Funny story. Freshman year I started DT @ 5'8"" 185. I was quick knew how to use my legs and Body leverage, and like to think I had good football instincts even though I was never very big. 

Trevor on the other hand played middle linebacker at 6'0 and 260 lbs. Lol. This was 1999 and in the non football factory state of MN there wasn't much passing at all as freshman. He would literally just identify the hole and destroy anything in his way to blow it up. The sound of fullbacks getting tossed three yards backwards still stands in my mind. 

Hitting Trevor in practice was like a force you never felt before. Like a brick wall was hitting you it's not a real person that you can fight against. 

He then went to varsity DT as a sophomore and I played with him again as a senior linebacker. I remember when he non chalantly in school was like I got this letter from Florida State. Thinking like holy shit man it was almost surreal it something

Also favorites in the  Northeast neighborhood are 1029 bar which has the smack shack kitchen inside and could possibly have one of their outdoor parties, stanleys, the yacht club for a greenie, dangerous man brewery and Baus Haus brewery. Sure I'm forgetting a couple over there. 

Northloop has a couple as well like freehouse or marvel for a little fancier to bunkers for music, runyons for amazing wings, Fulton brewery. some others

Id personally stay out of downtown, the crime down there has been bad and has been a topic on the news about how bad it's gotten and how overwhelmed the police staff is. Like people getting robbed in broad daylight by 10 people right outside the baseball stadium and not only robbed but beaten severely. 

I hadn't been downtown on a Saturday night in quite some time and I was this summer one night  and I was shocked. It might as well be the ghetto now and stores and restaurants are leaving left and right. 

I'm not a racist person by any means and I'm not a scaredy cat I worked security downtown for three years in college and generally have a bit of a chip on my shoulder I didn't necessarily feel safe.

Believe me, I used to walk back to the creek on my property and have a smoke at any time of night, I'm not afraid of the dark or horror movies, worked security and went to school to be a cop for awhile When I was younger. Not afraid of things.

There were 8 spirits here, including a peeping tom. I kid you not I was flicking this thing off while doing the dirty with the wife. Like I knew something was watching. 

I've been touched before but it was more like poking or bumping me on the shoulder in the garage or something. It was to the point where they'd touch me and I'd just be like leave me alone and try not to react. 

At it's worst they messed with me every night for two or three weeks. I wasn't sleeping much was at a new job was trying to remodel and move because i just knew a new house would fix our problems and ended having my second manic episode from bipolar. I had my first one only like 8 months prior and wasn't medicated due to self denial.

I started to see weird shit , shadkw figures peering in my bedroom and one night I was paralyzed in fear as they were coming face to face. I went under the covers like a little girl ha ha. I started asking for forgiveness and telling it that were leaving and I'm sorry, pleading. Then I hear some ding sound like a bell or something metal clinging and I immediately knew I could come out from under the covers.

Then I started seeing weird shit out and about. J remember once at Wendys eating and getting up and there's this dude sitting behind me that o never noticed which isn't like me. He stares at me a the way out of Wendys. I got some balls and went back inside and asked the guy if I knew him he just very blankly stared at me and said I don't t think so. Then there were these guys looking at us and kidna laughing weird that I also think we'rent really there.  I just walked out feeling weird

Then I think they tried to box me in on the freeway on my motorcycle. I passed this dude as the road from 45 -65 and looked at him and he just looked from a different era driving like an 87 Corolla. Lol. I remember thinking weird, right?

Then I came up on this rusted ass weird van that's in the left lane going 55 and it's bouncing up and down in the back like no car I ever scene before. In my rearview j see the white car coming and feeling stuck. There's an exit coming. I slowed down and just say in between for a second then took the exit at the last second like a stuntman and immediately turned home. 

Going home I heard this song for the first time by cage the elephant called ready to let go which is about death and i was just super creeped out by it. Stood out big time.

I have a friend who is very bipolar and everyone just thought he was nuts. Has even said hea been kidnapped by aliens. Hadn't talked to him in a decade. Thought I had to save him, nah man. He had to save me. He immediately came over. Felt everything immediately in the house. Stayed for a couple hours listening to my crazy ass. Calmed me down and ready for bed. Then we walked through this portal thing in the kitchen or something because we both were like it's gone, the feeling is gone just like that. 

As he was leaving I asked him how do I know all this is real and not just bipolar. We're standing in the driveway. We both at the same time snapped our heads at the garage and stared for a few seconds. I just looked At my buddy and Said see ya later man. 

My buddy says that because the chemical structure in our brain is different that we are more drawn to paranormal. The quack doc just says I had psychosis and wouldn't even really talk about it. 

So I ended up spending a week in the hospital from mania  and taking a two week vacation to Florida. 

Couple days later I'm with my buddy and I'm telling him about this crazy flying object I saw in 7th grade. So crazy I called my mom at work to tell her what I saw. He asks me to draw it. Kid you not before j finished he status belly laughing. Look I can barely draw stig figure ok all I did was draw the outline and start putting in some of the circle lights that were all over it. Weird. 

Couple days after that he's over abd we're just sitting on the front porch steps chatting. I got re radio out there as I love music. I ask him, like I know I have proof the paranormal is real, but is there anything you can point to there says the aliens are real. He starts getting a little defensive and confused acting and suddenly he screams ahhhhh my ear ahhhhh, then this odd shaped helicopter that looked like no other helicopter k remember seeing swoops over the neighbors house across the street like 4 houses down and status flying up and down like a swooping motion. My friend jumps up like those are aliens and runs to The street. We both watch for a Minute and I'm thinking weird man.

Then we sit back down on the steps and this song is playing. Another one I'd never heard. Another cage the elephant song.

It's title you might ask. In one ear......

My cousin committed suicide two years ago. This story happened last summer. On the night before mother's day I was up super late for some reason so it was mother's day witching hour and I was balling my eyes out thinking about my cousin which was odd and I hadnt been thinking or dwelling on it much.

My mom or step dad called the cops after I did some dumb shit and broke stuff at my moms when no one was there because i was super mad they wouldn't  help me come fix my house to get out of here because it was haunted and still is. The haunted part is real, it's not my bipolar just ask the wife. And I didn't even go there to do anything like that. My really crazy and bizarre day brought me there. My family knew something was wrong. I feel like they dropped the ball trying to help me big time. Now I'm on probation til July. Luckily if I take my meds and don't get arrested again during probation the charge won't be on my record. I then spent a week in the Looney bin and get medicated super hard. Im still dealing with medication issues and a major 6 month depression increased by the MN winter time but I haven't had the crazy mania.

Back to you. As long as you and your family and/or friends can get over yourselves and realize he's super sick and he's probably gonna say mean things that may or may not be hurtful, true, false, crazy, whatever. Just don't take it to heart and hold it against him. I feel like a basket case now anf I feel like people treat me different or don't want to spend time with me anymore. 

Again don't know how close you are, my brother wouldn't come get me two states over. Hell he flew home when someone saw me on the cameras breaking a couple things (one was accidental). He threw  me out the house and let the cops take me too. 

So point is bro, it's either going to be you or the eventually it will be the cops. Bring him to an inpatient facility where they won't let him leave until hes back. Whether it's a week or a month or 4. Seriously kick his ass if he completely refuses, bring a couple friends and he'll probably be less likely to be physical if he could be violent. He'll thank you for the clean record later because once I came out of mania I was shaking and knew I was on a fucking rollercoaster I couldn't control.

My house is definitely still haunted and we hear odd noises still pretty regularly. Never heard a voice but heard a whisper directly in my ear one night. My wife heard it as well. At the peak, I could feel something going in and out of me and my voice would change when I would feel it. They don't seem to mess with me anymore though. Not entirely sure how many are left but the mediums confirmed there were like 8 total feeding off my negative energy and in turn giving me negative energy. I was bringing more home with me, my cousin who committed suicide was there hovering above me according to them and that made so much sense for so many reasons. 

That said, I'm not a ghost expert. But I believe your story 100%. Your not in danger, but if you let it affect you or try to capture video in my experience whatever it is will do more and more. I'm not scared anymore but before the mediums came I was terrified for a few days. They chased me out my house one night when I had two dark shadow figures in my face pinning me to the bed. I left the wife and kids and bounced out at first I was so scarwd. I came home but drive are und the block a couple times. Oh the black cat..... lol. The night before the mediums came I was telling them they were coming like Ghostbusters. Lightbulbs were popping all over the house and so much activity that night. 

If you really want to do something I'd start by calling a medium. They should respond quickly. Otherwise just live your life and burn some sage. Don't be bothered. Don't look for them. And they'll move on. If it's attached to the home it will still be there, but it'll leave you alone if you do the same. Stay positive.

Thanks for the reply. We checked out online everywhere from Port Charlotte to Naples and there's some nice areas and affordable homes for sure. 

The safety of the bigger city, employment wise, stands out to me. I run accounting depts for small to midsize companies and everything that goes with that. Like $20-$40 mil in sales. How many of those could really be in the area and why would the bosses ever leave them  unless they're retiring. I think those would be extremely difficult to find in a smaller area. That said, maybe I'm the difficult one to find in that area I just don't know. 

TBH, idk if I could even do a senior accountant job at Hertz anymore. My experience is just small companies but then you have to be the boss to make any $. A senior accountant at Hertz does more complex accounting in a specific area of the business or unit, but knows nothing about commercial insurance, payroll, or many times controllers are responsible for HR related duties like onboarding and health insurance. 

I can run multi state payroll for 200 people, pick the right health insurance plan for the company and what to charge employees, etc but I've definitely lost and never gained real world knowledge the compexity of a large company. I'd have to start over.

 Me and her dad aren't nearly as close as we were, haven't ridden together or fishes really in two years. Nothing more than standard family things and events. I used to look at him as more than my own dad. 

So basically I feel like I have to squash what was our dream because people can't communicate and just continue being miserable. That doesn't seem fair to my family either. My kids deserve a functional dad for more than half the year. 

Also, dragging and selfish is a bit strong of words in my opinion. As someone who moved a lot growing up, everyone will be fine. What if I got an awesome job there first. Would I still be dragging them across the country?? 

In my mind, getting myself to a much better place is the complete opposite of selfish. Then I can really be the dad they need. Not a depressed shell of my former self. 

Tampa actually has a lower cost of living than Minneapolis. Is clean like Minneapolis.  Similar commute and no state income tax. Actually I think the ""living situation"" would improve as well"

Nothing seems to make me feel any different.  Not quite as hazy as when I had the olanzapine (after hospitalization for a week) but still super foggy, sleepy, and more depressed then I ever been.

Also, eat small amounts more often. Not just two big meals that stretch your stomach and leave it wanting more

Don't snack cuz you're bored at work. Don't keep snacks in the house. Eat an apple instead of potato chips that sort of thing and I think it'll come off. 

Are you man or woman? Women typically have a harder time losing weight than men.

As a man who's lost 60 lbs in 4-6 months and have had a little bit of weight issues my whole life I literally did it on mostly diet alone (blew up after high school, was eating like I was still playing football working out all the time, more fast food, etc.) I've never been fat until I was 250 lbs but I always was stocky and would fluctuate a bit depending on if it was football season or baseball lol ( football get your ass in shape ha ha)

Working out isn't nearly as important as food to maintain a healthy weight, now if you're talking cardio or brute strength that's where the working out really comes in. 

For a little while you literally will have to tell yourself no and it's hard I know. Sometimes I mini blow up to 215-220 and need to check myself back down to 200 or so. And you're so damn hungry.

Still feel like shit. They won't change my depakote because it keeps me from going manic, but I can barely function on it. I'm deeply depressed. I sleep A LOT. My whole life I was a 6-7 hour guy. Got my bachelor's working full time on no sleep etc. Now I'll sleep 12-15 hours on the weekends. Takes time away from my family and my kids. Have switched from abilify to vraylar to latuda which are bipolar antidepressants and idk man. Doesn't seem to do shit, to be frank.

I live in MN. they say that seasonal depression and similar is worse for people with bipolar than people with seasonal depression...... Lol go figure, right? I'm definitely way way happier in the summer. I'm seriously considering moving to Tampa Fl this summer. I'm over the depression the last three+ winter's of 5-6 month of chilly to cold temps. I love just being outside and driving with the windows down, etc. I don't enjoy my life for like half of it lol and it's been drastically affecting my family. 

I too have been indulging in vices, I'm assuming we're probably talking something similar. I haven't had much of a mom since I was about 12. She's around now but I don't feel any closeness. Haven't talked to my dad in two years because he's a narcissistic bipolar lunatic lol. My closest cousin committed suicide almost two years ago and long story short the paranormal mediums we had in our home said she is here projecting her sadness on me. Idk if she's still here now but I could tell you a story where that makes perfect sense to be true. 

I'm a high level accountant. I manage all accounting for a company with $25 mil in sales. Before I got fired the first time I did the same for a company with $50 mil sales. 

Which sucks btw, don't be an accountant lol. I can barely think and stay awake at work. My family rides on me, my wife isn't working and tbh will probably never make much money. I never cared before until the the pressure of my job and life being dependent on me. Our $500 truck payment and the $300 Harley payment, the now equity loan we have against our house when I was unemployed, all the bills, mortgage food etc. makes me unable to leave my bed at times. I was NEVER like that before. Always a go getter one I decided at 23 to go get it. I was making the $100k within 4 years of starting my career and honestly I'm good at accounting. But not anymore. I'm seriously considering driving a semi truck to get away from the stress and still be able to keep my family situation around the same. It's the only thing I can think of to do. 

Sorry I'm ranting now. Some of our personal feelings and experiences are similar. I had ups and downs as a teenager and my twenties for sure but nothing like what's been going on the last couple years. I honestly feel for you trying to do school and just being a younger person in general dealing with this terrible disability. I hate that word, and some people definitely dont treat me the same. 

Hell I even lost my spot on my softball team because I missed the last part of the season while hospitalized and recovering. I think the guy who runs it just thinks I'm unreliable to show up so don't waste the spot. My wife at times treats me like a child. Like I'm still a fuckin person here. 

I think I'm a little manic right now honestly. We got in a big fight this morning and she yells at me for how I act how I don't care how I sleep all the time and I just basically told her to shove it it a worse way because I can't control it and just basically laid out AGAIN how shitty all this is for me.

She could do more for me, but she has some of her own issues and no college degree. I love her anyways but I need life help like paying the bills and helping me think about shit because I just can't do it anymore it stresses me out too much.

bipolar,fep89ez,t1_fen0plo,1579314360.0,"I was an atheist until I experienced months of paranormal in my home. I still think there are spirits/ghosts here, but I don't see them anymore since getting on medication. The spirits in my home were confirmed by mediums, and even told me my cousin who committed suicide was above me projecting her sadness on me. This made a lot of sense at the time for other reasons and there is no way they would have known that she was gone. The mediums were even moving my brain around without touching me, telling me I was very intuitive. Very odd experience to say the least.

Fast forward, during the end of the paranormal haunting, I became manic and was not on medication yet. I got the idea I was supposed to save an old friend of mine, one I hadn't seen in a decade. This friend had been saying stuff for years about seeing things, being haunted, and even as far as being abducted by aliens. My friend is very bipolar. 

I called him thinking I was supposed to save him, from what I don't remember. In reality he was supposed to save me. He came to my house that night and immediately felt everything in the home that I had been experiencing. We walked through a portal that made the bad energy leave, it was odd and we both felt it at the same time. When he was leaving, I asked him how do I know what I'm seeing is real and not just bipolar, at that very moment we both felt and heard something come from my garage, we both snapped our heads and looked for about ten seconds. I looked at my friend and said I'll see you later man, and walked back inside. I didn't need an answer to my question.

Moral of the story is my friend said all I need is Jesus Christ, and truly believe he brought that positive energy with him that night. 

A couple nights later I was alone, wife and kids had left when I was manic. I was scared, which I don't scare easily. I had setup cameras to catch something, anything. I was feeling ok, then boom, I'm not alone. I feel it. Boom the motion detector in the camera goes off, boom I'm catching movement in my peripherals. Im scared at this point, and alone. The ghosts had already frightened me before, another story. 

I looked at the sky and said god if your real I could really use your help right now, and I played Spirit prayers by a YouTube evangelist named Gabriel Fernandez. I immediately felt safe and immediately knew I was ok. Very odd. I knew they were still there, but it was like they couldn't come close to me. I kept the prayers going and went to sleep feeling safe. 

Idk if the Bible is exactly what's happened, but I think there is definitely a higher power of some sort.

Not trying to change your mind here, just offering up my two cents from a different kind of experience. In a nutshell this is why I believe in God again. They think I was just in psychosis. My friend says that our brain chemistry is different and we attract these energies, idk if that's true or not but something to think about. I also don't know if the aliens were real or his bipolar, but I can tell you 2 odd stories about that that makes me wonder.

My opinion only, but there was a lot of bad in my life and the good people were dying way too young. Hard for me to believe at the time.

I have now flipped my script. During my paranormal experience I looked at the sky and asked God for help if he's real and felt safe immediately. Also playing prayers from YouTube made me feel safe immediately. 

I'm a skeptical accountant. 2+2 =4 if you know what I mean. Idk if Jesus is exactly the way the Bible is written and idk if I'll ever know. 

The problem to me with religious people is they push it down your throat and they need to realize people will make their own choices and make their own beliefs. I personally have not experienced a lot of athiests who are pushy but again I live in MN. The Midwest is pretty religious compared to the coasts. 

The paranormal I experienced were people not crossing over that lived previously in my home. My closest cousin that committed suicide. And other negative energy that I brought with me as the negative in my home brought me to a dark place and I went along with it.
