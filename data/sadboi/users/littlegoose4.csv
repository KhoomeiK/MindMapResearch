plantclinic,ffsn5id,t1_ffscqdb,1580185995.0,Like re-transplant it? I had it by the window but it didn’t like how cold it was. Thankfully spring is coming. I will move it closer again:)
plantclinic,f5vqdo5,t1_f5t76tx,1572496213.0,Ah that makes sense! I’ll lay back on the watering and see if it helps (I already barely water this sucker)
plantclinic,f5vqbha,t1_f5sf81p,1572496154.0,"Not the best drainage, just drainage rocks."
plantclinic,f5vq7kr,t1_f5s2wdf,1572496055.0,Haha! They’ve infested my entire house! I think my kids tracked them into the house...
plantclinic,f5rv0r4,t1_f5rl6yf,1572403692.0,"I’m not entirely convinced it’s overwatering, I thought maybe I was under watering it. I’ve had it for years and it just started doing this. My house is cold though, as winter hit hard and fast this year."

DreamInterpretation,f4wity0,t1_f4r55uk,1571856531.0,"Thank you for this insight, I’m still lost to what message it’s sending me. It makes sense it’s my ego, but why is it following me, and not wanting to be seen? Could it represent anxiety that I’ve been having the past few days? Even though I don’t know what I’m anxious about? Any suggestions to release these feelings and tame the ego?"
Parenting,f4r65e1,t3_dlg8u2,1571763317.0,"Ohhhh no! As a victim of childhood sex abuse, my abuser did ALL these things to me. I’m not saying your FIL is a molester, I’m saying these behaviours should not be normalized. My abuser was helpful, cared for all the kids, and everyone loved him. 
I agree with other posts, if you teach your children what is right and wrong as far as physical behaviour and teach them that they are allowed to say no, that goes a really long way. Also, having open communication with your girls about their boundaries and allowing them to speak to you about times they may have felt uncomfortable Is helpful. I have expressed to my daughters that this may feel like a tummy ache, or their tummies just feel funny. They’ll explain situations to me that are completely harmless but we are able to work through the feelings and everything then becomes easy to talk about.

I don’t think a divorce would help, it only separates you further from your children. 

You’re in a sticky situation, but I would stick to your gut feeling because 99% of the time... it is right.
I’m sorry you’re going through this"

mentalhealth,ewikm0m,t3_co584f,1565451274.0,"That’s actually amazing!!! I remember when I was first coming out of my depression, I had a shower and later thought.. whoa. That actually wasn’t difficult today. A shower! You accomplished a lot. I am proud of you :) I hope you’re proud of yourself too!"
MultipleSclerosis,evnaj82,t1_evh6zv2,1564621555.0,"I have had 2 MRIs several years ago, they said it didn’t correlate enough with my symptoms! Just wait it out more I guess!"
MultipleSclerosis,evfyl5e,t3_cjkm1p,1564503248.0,So happy you’ve found someone! I’ve been dealing with MS-like symptoms on and off for over 3 years but unable to diagnose. So frustrating!
MultipleSclerosis,eus45pj,t1_euqfq4i,1564003006.0,"I’m going through an ordeal right now as well. First “attack” was 3 years ago, scattered numbness on my left side of my body with blurry vision to left eye. Did a CT, which was clear. Doctor at the time felt it was MS and referred me to an neurologist to do an MRI, she said I only had one unspecified “hyper-density” which was not consistent with my symptoms. Stated I was having migrainous strokes despite not getting headaches, basically told me to ignore it.

Symptoms kept happening on and off, difficulty swallowing, face numbness, general weakness, depression and extreme fatigue. Also slurred speech and the worst memory. Had a follow up MRI with no real progression, LP came back normal. Doctor then said it was anxiety.

Now I’m having all the same symptoms that come and go but have foot drop to my left foot, non-stop restless leg syndrome, and muscle tightness (painful). I just started taking CBD oil which has helped so much. I still have no idea what is going on. Two internal specialist doctors feel it’s likely MS, my family doctor has no idea, and the neurologist feels it was a stroke. So I guess I’m still undiagnosed?"
