Witches have always been my most played life state - I like supernatural gameplay and occults, so this pack was a long time coming for me. I think the build/buy/CAS alone is worth it for me. I think the world is gorgeous (though the builds horrendous but thats to be expected) as far as spellcaster gameplay - I like that they are dubbed spellcasters, to give to player more flexibility on how creative they want to get with their mages (elfs, fairies, spiritual beings, not just wizards and witches) I often use spells and potions, but once again, I am really into the idea of supernaturals and go out of my way to utilize them. Something that turned me off from TS4 for a while is that gameplay is super modern - TS3 was more flexible if you wanted a more historic or dated play. ROM gave me items that suit the aesthetic I prefer to play with. As far as money making - I have had potion shops where I sell potions and collectibles. vampires were better fleshed out  imo, and I wish there was more pack crossover (vampiric sunscreen, cures for other occults, potions to be turned into other occults, etc) but besides that I am happy"
