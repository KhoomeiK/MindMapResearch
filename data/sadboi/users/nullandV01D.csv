askgaybros,f278lj7,t1_f26ekwo,1570032832.0,"I don't disagree, and that's largely what I do. For a while I got too fixated and only recently have I even started trying to date again. It's not so much worrying about being single but it makes the difference between you and your straight peers so much more pronounced when they can (not always, but often) form stable partnerships and your dating pool just isn't into it.

I do think the sex obsession thing is immature but the guy I mentioned on OkC was 34. Completely shutting the door without knowing much or anything about our sexual compatibility, and worse yet being unwilling to adapt a bit for the right person, is a little disheartening. 

There's a lot of denial around our hypersexual culture and how it leaves people feeling used, empty, and alone. You get called a prude for daring to mention, though."
