I started cutting my own hair a few weeks ago. I was surprised that I was able to do so well using the electric clippers and the clipper guides. Even though I thought I did a pretty good cut, every few day I was curious what it would look like if I took it down another level. 8 days ago, I shaved it off completely -- bald. 

There is something very liberating about shaving your head. But I recommend only doing such a thing over a period of time. Meaning, take it down level at a time.

Now I am growing it back. I discovered that I like it best at about 7mm. And it grows back pretty fast. 

I like that I now know it looks like at different lengths. And I also like that I'm not afraid to take it to any length anymore. 

I would say try cutting your own hair. And if you don't like it, don't worry there's always a hat to wear and it will grow back."

For example, in this case, the all-or-nothing (distorted) thought is that it is unsafe to go outside because going outside will get you the coronavirus. But this is an extremely overreaching solution to a fear. It would be no different than being afraid of the outdoors because of all the car accidents. Or being afraid of the outdoors because of criminal activity. 

Previously, how were you able to go outside with all the car accidents and criminal activity in the world?

Well you probably look both ways when you cross the street as well as following all the traffic laws when driving. And you probably don't go walking alone at night in dark alleys in the bad part of town. But you still went outside, you just adapted your outdoor behavior using common sense.

Yes, common sense dictates that some activities should be avoided, but the outdoors is a place where you can still find plenty of safe and enjoyable things.

Just avoid close personal contact with third parties—that you don't live with. As long as you are keeping a distance and following the general protocols (wearing a mask as an extra precaution), you're perfectly fine enjoying a nice walk or hike outdoors.

Anxiety,fccob8d,t3_eh1tjo,1577600714.0,"Welcome to the anxiety subreddit. This is the place where you will find tons of people who have very similar symptoms and experiences as you have described.

Each of them are at a different place in their healing process. Let me just tell you that, no matter how difficult your situation seems, it really CAN get better. Never forget that. And never give up on yourself.

The thing about anxiety is that often it seems like a form of dark magic that just gets cast upon us. 

It is not uncommon to hear a person say something like, one day I was perfectly fine and then suddenly -- out of nowhere -- anxiety struck, and everything changed.

You mentioned that you were just sitting at your desk working. But the fact of the matter is that, when anxiety hits, we do not need to focus on what we were physically doing, but what we were mentally doing. Your mind detected something disturbing within you. Something that caused a reaction of panic.

After you experienced the panic, you then went to get yourself checked out, to make sure that you all right. The doctor told you that nothing physically was wrong with you, but your mind was still feeling that there is something wrong; and that becomes a trigger for the anxiety. The fact that, even though there is nothing wrong, the feeling of something being wrong remains. When we have issues with anxiety it is because we do not know how to deal with the remaining feelings that are created by our worrisome thoughts. 

Taking medications often helps people to deal with symptoms that trigger anxiety responses. But it is very helpful for a person that is experiencing severe anxiety issues to talk to a qualified therapist. 

When you sit down and talk with a psychologist, they will help you to understand how to manage your thoughts and your feelings. They will help you to understand where you need to make improvements so that anxiety can no longer thrive.

It can get better. Just utilize the resources that are available to you like psychologists or counselors. They will help guide you back to mental health."
Anxiety,fb7to68,t1_fb7981n,1576599134.0,"This is the most difficult part of getting better for all of us. The fact that we get stuck between a rock and a hard place. We then convince ourselves that the obstacles are supposed to just disappear at some point. But the mind that created the obstacles doesn't know how to do anything but reinforce the obstacles. This is why the fix is always going to be to add an outside influence. An influence that can see past the obstacles, reinforce tearing them down, and help the person to resist giving up on themself.

Of course, it is possible to pick up a book and be inspired enough to make the changes. But that's asking a lot for a person who has invested decades into a fear based perspective.

When I push for therapy, I'm really saying there is no need to do this on your own. There are people that are willing and able to carry some of the weight of the healing process. To make traversing obstacles just a little bit less difficult than it would be if you tried to do it on your own, without any real guidance. 

Having said all that, a great way to prime a person for therapy is to give them a therapy book that it is used in therapy. 

I would recommend that the OP pick up Dr. David Burns book, ""Feeling good: the new mood therapy"" to see methods that are used to help a person challenge their obstacles. 

But always remember that the doctors of the world, while they may seem like harbingers of bad news, are only there to tell us what we are already suffering from, so they can assist us in easing that suffering.

Anxiety,faibmff,t3_e9avqm,1576104039.0,"I am not a doctor. I carry absolutely zero qualifications when it comes to diagnosing mental conditions. 

But being a person who has dealt with anxiety and depression for many years, I have a perspective based on treatment, personal education, and good old-fashioned experience. So always take everything I say with a grain of salt.

Recently I read a book by Dr. Amen, you may have seen one of his PBS specials. He is a clinical psychiatrist that writes books all about brain imaging and diagnosis based on brain imaging. In one of his books, he said something that I thought was really interesting about diagnosis. Basically, diagnosing mental conditions -- like anxiety and depression -- is very unique in that, the majority of the time, the doctor does not look at the part of the body that is experiencing an illness before making the diagnosis. 

In other words, if you were to go into a hospital, complaining that you think you have broke your arm, the doctor would likely insist on scanning your arm, to see what kind of damage was done, and then the doctor would make a diagnosis and begin treatment.

But when doctors diagnose a mental condition, like anxiety, it seems that it is more important for for them to hear anecdotal evidence within your life. 

Based on hearing your anecdotal evidence, they compare your history to the DSM-5 (Diagnostic a Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - version 5) and issue a diagnosis and treatment plan that matches your history.

There are people like Dr. Amen that are really trying to use brain imaging to improve the diagnostic process, but science moves at its own speed. Looking at the parts of the brain to diagnose is still not widely accepted yet. Why? I don't know. Maybe they haven't done enough trials to really significantly say that they can look at the brain and make a diagnosis accurately. Who knows, maybe 20 years from now, all mental conditions will be diagnosed with a brain scan."

For people that find themselves stuck in the anxiety loop, the option that they have to improve themself is to seek out professional help, so that they can be guided out of the loop. But while a professional can guide a person through a loop, each person needs to be willing to be guided. Each person must choose to allow themself to change their perspective. For each person that is stuck in the anxiety loop, this change requires courage. Courage being the process of doing something, even though you are afraid.

My advice to you now is to simply be patient and fair to yourself as you go through this process of healing. 

Understand that, in life, you will always have good and bad days -- that is completely normal. Therapy is like any other type of education. 

To use a university analogy, it's kind of like taking classes to achieve a University degree. Some courses that you take will be very easy, while other courses will be very very challenging -- to the point where you may want to quit. But whether a course is easy or it is challenging, it is still important that you continue to show up and try. 

Often the courses that we take, that are difficult, are the ones that help us grow the most. 

This is the same with therapy. Often the places in therapy that we find the most difficult are the places where we need the most education of self. 

Just try not to run away from those challenges. Be honest about those difficulties, explore them and learn from them.

Not only was it painful but, psychologically, it created a lot of suffering. But I got through it, and you can get through it too. Don't give up. It can get better. 

Here are some suggestions:

1) I found that exercise actually helped a lot. It got my blood flowing, releasing endorphins, as well as stretching out my muscles. In addition, it helped me to acclimate to changes in feeling. Because when you're exercising your body kind of goes through a cascade effect of feelings. And that tended to be something that would be a trigger for me. But, when I did it in a controlled way -- through exercise -- it helped me to understand that those feelings will pass; and that they didn't have to stop me from making progress.

Exercise worked so well for me that I became a hiker and later runner. Now, I run every other day for at least 4 miles through nature. It's probably my favorite part of the day. :)

2) Consider talking to a psychologist, if you haven't done so already. I know that it seems kind of crazy to say that talking to someone can help you with physical pain.

Remember that GP's are trained to help patients with mental health issues. So going to your GP is the perfect place to start.

The moment I started to really get better was the moment I did exactly what you are doing right now.

When talking to your GP, just be forthright about the issues that you are having. There's nothing you can say that your GP has not heard before. It's important that you convey the full extent of your issues to them, so they can best help you. 

I would also ask your GP if they can give you some recommendations for a few psychologists. The reason I say a few is because often psychologists are not taking new patients; so you need a few options.

Remember that your GP does not tell you what you have to do, instead they will offer you some options. You choose the path that you want to take. 

The remaining advice I would give you is that if you build a trusting relationship with your GP, it makes it very easy for you to test a variety of different options. 

For many, the mental health treatment process is a little bit of trial and error. It's great when you have a professional that can guide you through the process of finding the things that best work for you."

First off, the American health-care system is really bad when it comes to covering the cost of treatment for mental healthcare. Having said that, all of my psychologist visits were included in my monthly premiums. In other words, it cost me nothing additional to visit my psychologist -- something that I did once a month for years. 

My psychologist never tried to upsell me. He didn't ever recommend that I go on medication. He didn't ever recommend that I visit a psychiatrist. When I did go to the psychiatrist, I did it out of personal curiosity -- I was wondering if there were things I hadn't tried that might be helpful.

The guy in this video makes the argument that many people simply need a person that they can openly talk to, if they want to get similar help as they would get from a therapist. This is true, but there is a downside to asking your family or friends to take on the burden of having to hear your problems all the time. The point of going to a professional is that you don't have to contaminate your friends and family with your problems, or burden them with your issues. I just want my family and friends to be my family and friends. 

The second half of the video he talks about how abusive it can be for the social worker to have to hear people's problems all day long, everyday. I remember talking to my psychologist and he told me that he would often get screamed at by his patients, and that it was very emotionally draining at times to help his patients. This is the reason why I think I could never become a therapist. I don't have the energy to hear people's problems continuously. 

I would say that being a therapist is probably kind of like being a fireman. There are people that are better suited for certain professions than others. Some people can run into burning buildings while other people can listen to people's problems.

When we do this we are able to better understand the source of our reaction to the thoughts and even learn to accept them. In the therapy process, when we talk about challenging our thoughts, we are talking about bringing them to the forefront for evaluation, to see if there's anything we can do to improve our perspective.

But you are talking more immediately about dealing with the thought in the moment. It is true that, in the moment, we must learn to accept that our thoughts will often flow in undesirable directions. In the moment, we must learn to accept that it is okay for our thoughts to flow that way.

Once the logic work-around is accepted by the patient, suddenly the distorted way of thinking becomes less and less automatic. In other words, that the neural network has found a new route.

Anxiety,f7qufaz,t3_dxgddu,1573969788.0,"The manual breathing anxiety hit me many years ago, so I know exactly how you feel. The good news is that you will get past it.

The anxiety is based on the fact that you believe you can actually fatally stop yourself from breathing. But the reality is you cannot do it. No one has ever willfully held their breath to death -- ever. It cannot be done. Your body would not permit it. It's built to not permit it. 

If you've ever gone swimming, and try to swim the full length of the pool, under water, you would notice that the feeling that you need to breathe would be so intense that you would have extreme difficulty not taking in air. Your resistance to breathe would become very very difficult, until you finally gasp for air, the moment that you rose out of the water.

So, if it's impossible, you may be wondering why it feels like it is.

Here's the funny thing, when I was experiencing the breathing anxiety, it was actually causing me to over-breathe (hyperventilate), mainly because I was thinking about breathing so much that I thought I had to breathe deeper and more rapidly -- doing this was only creating uncomfortable sensations that were making me more anxious. These sensations are actually caused by hyperventilation.

The interesting thing about hyperventilation is that, because it decreases the amount of carbon dioxide(CO2) in your blood, it can create a sensation that may cause your anxious mind to interpret that you need to breathe, even though you don't. I believe this happens because your body is just sensing that there is a change in the balance of oxygen and CO2 -- your body prefers a good balance. Remember, even though hyperventilation may cause some discomfort, that discomfort is in no way dangerous. But, being a person with anxiety means that we often interpret feelings in distorted ways.

The thing that I learned to do with breathing was to understand that the problem was really just my anxious mind jumping to an impossible conclusion.

I learned that the easiest way for me to reduce the anxiety was simply to slow my breathing, even when the temptation to breathe deeper and more rapidly was present. By slowing my breathing, I found that the hyperventilation generated sensations, that were triggering anxiety, started to disappear. And I returned to feeling normal in less than 5 minutes. 

Once you accept that it is impossible for you to fatally stop your breathing, the anxiety about breathing seems disappear."

Therapy is a tool that helps you to navigate through your thoughts, feelings and behaviors. 

What separates therapy from self-help is that, with a therapist, you have a trained observer and influencer they can guide you in the right direction.

The reason why it is important for many of us to get professional help is because, generally, our minds are so full of distorted thinking, that we do not know how to help ourselves. Instead, we find ourselves in a continuous cycle of anxious thinking and bad habits.

An analogy that might be helpful is that of a person that chooses to educate themself. Now, you could just go on the internet and learn how to do just about anything. But when a person goes to school they have access to teachers that are highly trained in the fields that you need to learn. 

Of course you could always do everything on your own. But you'll likely have an easier time if you have someone guide you through the process. A person that will make sure that you are not focusing on the wrong things. A person that will help you when you encounter hurdles. 

Don't give up on therapy. Just be patient with it. Remember that you are likely trying to deal with issues that you have established and reinforced for decades. Nobody just gets rid of a lifetime worth of issues with a couple sessions. It takes time."

That number isn't even factoring in depression and other disorders. It's also important to note that mental health is not a static thing. For example, a person may suffer from mental health issues for a period of time. You could make the argument that at some point in a person's life each person will deal with mental health issues. It's also important to note that seeing a person act in a normal way does not mean that they are not experiencing mental health issues.

But the reality is that all choices take you on a personal journey of discovery; and that's what really matters. With each choice that you make, you will gain a clearer vision of who you are and what you are about. 

In some cases, it will be very easy for you to select an option. In other cases, where the options appear to be equal, all options are good options. You could practically flip a coin -- you can't go wrong. But let's say that you do make a choice that causes you to discover something that you do not enjoy. Well that's actually a good thing because it helps make future choices just a little bit easier.

I think what I'm trying to say is that you are an explorer trying to figure out what you're all about. No matter what choices you make, you will learn more about yourself; and it will become easier for you to see why you would actually like to do one thing versus another. The more that you explore, the more you will know yourself. 

The funny thing, that I have noticed throughout life, is that what you want now will be completely different than what you want 10 years from now. As you get to know yourself, your perspective on what brings you happiness changes. For example, when I was 12, all I wanted was to play video games. Now, I'd rather go for a hike in nature. Did making choices in my childhood that would cause me to play more video games hinder me? No. I needed to explore that interest until I was ready to move on to something else. In this case, playing video games made me feel disconnected, and that opened my eyes to trying to find ways that would make me feel more connected. 

Just keep exploring, and understand that every choice you make will teach you something about yourself. And the more that you know yourself, the easier it will be for you to make informed decisions."

Except, people don't usually say those words. Instead, they just say,  ""whatever..."" and walk away.

The fact of the matter is that many people are spending most of their time worrying about their own issues; and very little time worrying about other people's problems.

These people just don't have the energy to hear other people's problems. Instead they want to escape into relaxation; or things that bring about relaxation.

So don't get caught up in feeling judged by your friend for telling her how you feel. Just understand that not everybody's going to have the energy to listen -- this is why we pay therapists. 😉

The reality is that the best way to get better is to go to your family doctor (GP) and tell them you are experiencing debilitating anxiety symptoms. They will quickly be able to determine if there is something physiologically causing those symptoms. If they can't determine that there is something physiologically causing the problem, then they will likely diagnose you with an anxiety disorder. In that case, they will have a variety of recommendations for you. That may include talking to a psychologist. That may include giving you book recommendations to do bibliotherapy.

Anxiety,f46zmiw,t3_djolrh,1571415567.0,"It's a good idea to start by making an appointment with your family doctor and getting a checkup or, preferably, a full physical examination.

This will allow your doctor to see if there is something physical that is causing your problem. If there is something physical causing your problems, than that will likely be an easy fix with medication -- not medication for depression or anxiety, but medication for a physical ailment. 

It is very likely that you do not have any physical ailment causing the problem, but it's always good to check.

During your examination make sure that you tell your doctor about your psychological issues or concerns -- it's good to give them some examples of how your day-to-day life has been affected by your psychological state.

It's important to understand that your doctor (general practitioner) is trained to help people not only with physical problems but also with anxiety, depression and other mental disorders.

Ask the doctor if they can give you 2 - 4 recommendations for a clinical psychologist who can help you to learn techniques to improve your situation. You generally need a few recommendations because not all psychologists are available to take new patients. 

Remember that your doctor won't just make you take medication, instead, they will offer you that option if they feel that it will help you. If you feel uncomfortable with medication, simply tell them that you would like to try speaking with a psychologist first to see if that helps. Most doctors will be satisfied with your desire to try working with psychologist. 

Having said all of that, your general practitioner should be the center of all of your health care. If they really feel that a medication will greatly help you, seriously consider it. Medications are not bad. The problem that most people have with medications is because they they tend to think that it will solve all of their problems. But, in most cases, medications will only relieve symptoms.

Anxiety,f2392jk,t3_dbkzos,1569911430.0,"It's irresponsible of your boss to suggest that being on medication is a bad thing. Diagnosis and treatment should be left to the professionals.

I'll be 43 this year. I can tell you that things change over time. I was on medication for a short period of time and now I'm not. But there would be absolutely nothing wrong with being on medication, if my doctor felt it was required.

There is a stigma in our society that would have us believe that medication is bad if it's for mental health. But no one would actually walk up to a person, who has diabetes, and tell them that they shouldn't expect to live on insulin injections for the rest of their life -- people with diabetes need insulin to keep their body in balance.

Some mental disorders have a biological connection and therefore they may require medications to return our systems to balance.

What I would suggest to you, is find a therapist who you can talk to. See if the therapist can help you to develop anxiety management skills. This is a good thing to do, whether you are on medication or not.

In my 40's, I have noticed that I can be in the presence of my anxiety triggers and prevent them from becoming a panic. I have learned to manage them by understanding how my mind works and understanding what techniques work best for letting those anxious feelings pass.

In addition, I have learned that my anxiety is used as an expression of my subconscious mind. While an unmanaged anxiety experience can lead a person to a panic. Anxiety also signals us take a closer look at the components of our day-to-day life. 

Sometimes our anxiety is just speaking up for us, telling us that we are wasting our time doing things that don't fulfill us.

Doing therapy helped me to restructure my life to be a healthier happier one. To be a place where I surround myself with things that I desire and need. And to remove the toxic parts of my life.

Anxiety,f1q00w5,t1_f1pumta,1569691008.0,"You should check out some books on brain science. They can be very helpful in understanding why exactly people experience anxiety.

Basically, your brain creates neural networks. Each of us develops and associates our experiences to the established neural networks.

Humans have evolved to have a brains that establish neural networks very easily when you have experienced trauma. For example, once a child has touched fire, they will never touch fire again. They don't need to have a burn experience, over and over again, they just need to establish the neural network that tells them fire is dangerous.

As we live our lives we tend to associate our experiences to our established neural networks, and reinforce those neural networks, making them stronger and easier to trigger.

Sometimes we do not have to experience physical pain at all in order to exhibit a fear response. All we have to do is trigger the neural network. 

So,let's say that you survived a fire, and you have developed a neural network the tells you that you need to avoid fire at all cost. You may watch a movie and simply see a fire, that may be enough to trigger your neural network to have a panic response. 

So that would be an example of how pain experience could create a panic response. But, what if instead of a fire, your parents got a divorce. In this case you may establish a traumatic neural network that makes you worried about stability of relationships. In this case you may get into an argument with a significant other, and that may trigger the neural network to have a panic response. 

In one case, the source of the neural network was a physical trauma, and the other it was an emotional trauma. Both can equally trigger an anxiety response.

It's all about your establish neural networks and the things that trigger them. the cool thing about most brain science books is that they will tell you that you can actually create neural networks that are healthier. It just takes conscious effort."

It took me a while to understand why this bombardment of symptoms was always happening. But I think I have finally come to understand it.

In my formative years, I learned to expect failure and discontent. I designed myself to be resistant to continuous attack. I expected pain and suffering at every turn. Due to this, I made myself into a failure warrior. This is not a warrior that fights for victory, but, instead, a warrior that fights for survival.

I programmed myself to see the world as a survivor. 

The problem with the survivor perspective was that it came with an expectation of inevitable failure. With this mentality, victory could only be temporary.

So, when I was happy and content, and everything was going right, I would subconsciously be keeping my guard up, waiting for everything to be taken away.

And after I had reached the pinnacle of success and happiness, I would tear myself down and return to the fight. To a place where things cannot be taken away from you.

The consequence of the survivor mentality was that I had become afraid of being too happy. This meant that I would shy away from things that would bring me true happiness. 

On a scale of 1 to 10, I found myself seeking out the 5 existence, where I could continue a life as a failure warrior -- the devil I knew.
..........
..........
Reading that again, sounds kind of sad. It is. But there is comfort in being able to recognize your weaknesses. By recognizing them, and being honest about them, you can finally do something to change your situation.

People mostly crave being heard. When they see that you are actively interested in what they say, they find that they want to talk to you more. And if a person finds that you are an active listener, on two or three separate occasions, they start to feel comfortable around you. 

I was a bit of a loner through college, but I found that people wanted to hangout a lot because I would listen more than I would talk. After a while, my active listening helped me to develop their trust -- and this is where true friendship is born. 

Two people, in particular, from college, are still two of my closest friends -- even though I've been out of college since 2000.

But, it didn't end there. I've used this technique outside of college to develop additional friends, in places that I would regular. For example, I am a huge nature lover. I would encounter people on my hikes and just get into little chats, where I would ask them about themselves, and just let them talk. Now, when I bump into them, they're excited to tell me how things are going, and sometimes we go out to dinner or coffee. 

Now it may sound like I am telling you to just listen to people. But, after a while, some people will see that you are such a good listener that they will want to understand more about you.

The scary thing about this was that being an independent minded person felt like a scary risk. It seemed so much easier when elders told me what to think and what to do.

Life can be scary sometimes. Sometimes we don't know where exactly we belong. Sometimes we don't know how we're going to financially support ourselves. And we get depressed and anxious because frankly we are overwhelmed a little bit. But just keep giving yourself a break. You are a human being. You don't need everything to be perfect in order to make progressive moves in your life. You are at the beginning of a really great journey of finding yourself. I know it seems really scary right now. But it should be kind of scary. This is the beginning of an adventure for you. Take it one day at a time. 

And If you're having a hard time finding your direction, I would recommend that you talk to a counselor or a therapist. You can usually get a really good recommendation from your general practitioner. These types of professionals can help us to sift through all of the things that are distracting us, so that we can create a proactive agenda. You can do it. :)"
Anxiety,erdrjkw,t3_c1hfrb,1560753759.0,"I've been talking about anxiety for quite some time, with lots of people, and I have noticed that some people do not like the phrasing, ""suffering from anxiety."" Whenever I talk about it, I tend to use the phrase ""dealing with anxiety"" instead. In a way, I feel like both phrases represent phases of our anxiety experience. We are all ""suffering from anxiety"" until we get to the point that we are actually ""dealing with anxiety."""
Anxiety,erdqmrj,t3_c1j00y,1560752512.0,"These are all very common anxiety symptoms. In my early years of anxiety -- before I was willing to get some help -- I had all the same symptoms. I would go numb down my back, head and face with tingles. I was terrified and visited doctors. They said it was anxiety. This was back in 2004 - 2006. It was all induced by anxiety that was out of control. Have you ever tried talking with a therapist? It helped me a lot. I feel like sometimes we need to relearn how to process our feelings."
Anxiety,erdq0rq,t3_c1jmt9,1560751687.0,"Just be honest with your counselor about your concerns with the therapy process. Tell them that you are out of your comfort zone when talking about your emotions. This will allow the counselor to see that maybe they need to spend some time building trust with you. To show you that it is a safe and healthy place for you to open up about your feelings. Once you have developed a trust with your counselor, you will notice that you will want to open up more. 

Therapy is kind of like an adventure that comes with a tour guide. They are letting you decide where you want to go, but they are there to help you through the rough spots. 

Therapy is fantastic. It's a place where you get to learn all about yourself and see the places where you can improve and heal yourself. :)"
Anxiety,erbcbii,t3_c17fdc,1560671915.0,"Embarrassment can be complicated because it requires you to let it go. The way that you allow yourself to let it go is to accept that you're human, and that it is alright to make mistakes. Understand that every single person in this world makes mistakes. Today it was you, but tomorrow it'll be someone else. Nobody can really keep up with all of our mistakes, there's just too many of them happening. Learn what you can learn for the mistake, and then just except that it's okay; and that you are just another human being, experiencing what it is like to be human."
Anxiety,erbbpn5,t3_c17dai,1560670966.0,"Your doctor is an a-hole. Not all doctors are equal. I would recommend that you look into finding another doctor who doesn't treat you this way. It is the responsibility of every doctor to make their patients feel comfortable coming to them with their mental and physical health issues. It sounds like your doctor is too busy for you anyway.

I'm sick and tired of doctors, with terrible people skills, scaring patients away from getting help. It's possible that there is truth in what the doctors are saying about treatment, but they are terrible at conveying that information to you, and are not listening to your concerns.

I promise you that there are really great doctors out there that will listen to you and not treat you in such abusive ways. Try calling your insurer to get a list of other general practitioners. When you have a good trusting relationship with your doctors, you are more likely to get the help that you need. 

You deserve better. :)"
Anxiety,erbat3o,t3_c16b0o,1560669608.0,"Congratulations on being drug free! 💪

It's possible that you are creating an expectation for panic. If it happens all the time when you're watching TV or YouTube, you must be subconsciously starting to wonder if it's going to happen again whenever you put yourself in that same scenario. 

This reminds me of an issue that I used to have whenever I was feeling most content with my life. There would be something in the back of my mind that would say, ""Is it gone? Will this peace last? I wonder if it's still there?"" And next thing I know, I'm experiencing anxiety, because I can't believe that it would let me go. But in reality, I have just chosen to believe the distorted thought that had convinced me that I can't be happy. 

The best way to deal with these ""surprise attacks"", is to talk to a therapist and try to figure out how your mind works. To see if you can discover where the minefields are located in the back of your head. 

It can get better. Have you ever tried talking to a cognitive-behavioral therapist? They help you to deconstruct your distorted thoughts and replace them healthy ones that allow you to experience happiness without the minefield.

It can get better. :)"
Anxiety,erb9yl6,t3_c16czj,1560668371.0,"Often, when we first start dealing with something like an anxiety disorder. The thing that is most troublesome to us is feeling like we don't have any real options. This happens because either we once had bad experience with a therapist, or something that a doctor recommended didn't work the first time around for us. In other words, we have lost trust in the system that is supposed to be here to help us. But the fact of the matter is, people that get better fastest, are the ones that utilize the resources that are available, and trust the professional that are in charge of their care.

If you don't like your doctors, find a new doctor that you feel more comfortable with. Doctors are really just like any people. Some people have personalities that we feel comfortable with, while others have personalities that we despise. 

In my opinion, the secret to finding mental health is developing a trusting connection with your doctors. Communicating when things are, and are not, working for you. In addition, having a trustworthy person, such as a psychologist, to communicate your feelings too, can help you to realize that you are not alone and that things can get better. 

I would highly recommend that you ask your doctor for recommendations for a psychologist that is a cognitive-behavioral therapist. They will help you to deal with all of the racing thoughts. 

Life is worth living. Just utilize all of the healthy resources that are available to you. Build trusting relationships with the people that are responsible for your care. And give yourself a break. You're human. It can be tough at times. But there's so much beauty in this world to discover and things can get better. :)"
Anxiety,erb8q2r,t3_c16q2p,1560666661.0,"In all likelihood, you are all right, and are just experiencing some sort of migraine. Migraines can be really terrifying when you first experience a specific type that you've never had before. They can do everything from causes you to lose some of your vision temporarily, to seeing lights and zig zags and stuff like that. And in some cases they can completely cause you to have a mental block -- speaking gibberish, not being able to read or remember people's names. Migraines can completely mimic a stroke. But, when you have a stroke, the issues don't just come and go. I would schedule an appointment to have a physical with your doctor. They will likely prescribe something for migraines. Make sure you tell your doctor about your drug use, it will help them to better prescribed a solution, or even tell you if the issue is related."
Anxiety,erb7vta,t3_c16rca,1560665526.0,"This form of anxiety is called ""hypochondria."" It is probably one of the most common types of anxiety that people have. It is as if you are hyper conscious of every feeling that you experience in your body. And your distorted thought process tells you that it must be life threatening. This causes you to have elevated anxiety or even an anxiety attack. 

Ask your family doctor if they can recommend a therapist for you to talk to -- to help you explore how you process your feelings. The thing about anxiety is that it can produce a wide variety of physical symptoms, due to the ""fight or flight"" response -- which releases adrenaline into your system that causes most of the symptoms.

Overall, my personal opinion is that the best way to deal with hypochondria is to learn how to process your feelings through some talk therapy with a psychologist. In talk therapy they will help you to understand your thought process. Helping you to see where you are jumping to conclusions about your feelings and triggering an anxiety response. In addition, you will learn how to dismantle the distorted thoughts that are causing you to have an anxiety response.  

It's always good to get a full physical from your doctor to make sure that there isn't some sort of hormonal issue exciting your system but, once they have cleared you, talk therapy will likely help you gain back control."
Anxiety,eon5m9w,t3_bsgjce,1558704918.0,"A migraine can cause temporary vision problems. And a migraine can also trigger your anxiety. My first panic attack happened when I was experiencing my first visual migraine. I didn't know I had a migraine at the time because my visual migraines don't hurt at all, they would just cause me to see ""zigzags"" or sometimes the center of my vision would blur for a while."

&#x200B;

First, go to your doctor and tell them what's going on. Be completely open and honest with them. Your doctor will give you a physical and figure out the best types of treatments for whatever condition you may have.  It's important to remember that your doctor is qualified to diagnose and treat both physical and mental conditions -- like anxiety.

&#x200B;

It's also important to remember that your doctor works for you. Meaning they are just there to give you professional advice on how to get better. 

&#x200B;

Ask them for a variety of options, from recommendations for a psychologist to options about medication. Then select the option that you like the best. Your doctor won't make you choose anything. They will just provide you with things you can select from.   


As a person that has dealt with Anxiety for a couple decades, let me tell you that the secret to getting better is reaching out to the resources -- like doctors and psychologists -- that can put you back on track."
