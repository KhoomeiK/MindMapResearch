I can understand if they suffer seeing their partner suffer, or another thing, but if they are angry their partner 'was touched'' by someone oh my god this is selfish. If they consider this cheating, I don't believe in hell, but there is a place for them there.

Because the person who got assaulted didn't chose this, they didn't betray their partner. It was never their fault. 

I don't want to underestimate what a partner may be feeling, but my intuition says they turn the problem on them, while the person who got assaulted is the one that needs help, support. 

Conclusion, they are shitty person because they are selfish. They don't understand their partner didn't consent to anything and they view their partner as their territory. Their ego is so huge that they don't think the problem as it is, but they find a way to make it about themselves. They blame the partner for doing something they didn't have control of.

This is my opinion. I think your partner is on the wrong side and I hope your partner supports you and understands you. You deserve someone that understands<3."

First of all you assume all women think the same way.

Then, you turn rejection into something very bitter and dangerous, calling women whores. Wow. Maybe it's not your looks you get rejected for.

Rejection is hard and people can be mean. But you've made assumption even for people you haven't met yet and you are very sexist. So, if they didn't reject you, you would still judge them  as whores. Every woman wants a kind man like this. (not)

Why do you want to date people if you hate them?

Looks can play a role, I won't pretend society doesn't value outliers on this field, but people look past that. When you have a personality and take some responsibility. And not all people have the same taste.

I'm no model either, but I don't get mad for people rejecting me, I keep in mind what I can offer as well, not only what I want to get. Its not pleasant, but living a life blaming everyone but you is worse.
