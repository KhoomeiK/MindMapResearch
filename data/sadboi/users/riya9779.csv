exmuslim,fhjf583,t1_fhjet8o,1581644664.0,They’re die hard wanting me to be a doctor.... but without the moving away. My mum wants me to have an education but isn’t so hard core about it where she’ll put my needs above hers. She just wants me at home all the time to herself. When I lie about uni trips and going away for the weekends to “training for university” I was away for 4 days and she cried for two of them and my sister was telling me she would smell my clothes at night as if I Died or something. This is just me being away for 4 days imagine me moving out. Moving out is definitely the first step for me though. I want to do my masters away from my town but don’t know how to approach my parents about it considering my dad didn’t even want me to go uni in the first place
exmuslim,fhjemk0,t1_fhjefsv,1581644294.0,How did your parents take it when you told them you was moving away? I wish I could move away! I could even get disowned for that and seen as selfish  even if I moved away for uni
exmuslim,fhje9eu,t1_fhjdzrq,1581644034.0,My mother is my best friend. It’s just her views that stop us being even closer. And I don’t think I could do it by letter bc my mum can’t ready English and my dad probably wouldn’t be able to comprehend what I’m saying or feeling fully by letter. He’s one of them ones where he doesn’t understand texts or emails much just likes everything to be explained face to face. - how long do you think it’d take to become financially dependent ?
exmuslim,fhjdd7c,t1_fhjd4qw,1581643404.0,"I’m 22. Wbu? I plan on moving out in hopefully a year. I don’t even have any savings atm either. And I don’t think I would be able to tell them I’m leaving face to face. I kid you not, my mum would cry like she’s just seen someone shot in front of her and try and inflict some harm to herself in attempt to emotionally blackmail me to stay. I really haven’t figured out the telling them part yet but I know I can’t do it by text or face to face which leaves me with .... no other options I can think of lol"
exmuslim,fhjcyzi,t1_fhjbms8,1581643122.0,"It won’t let join the sub reddit because it’s private. 


And I’m in the similar situation at the moment, I really want to move out, I can’t bare living the double life for more years but I just can’t imagine what leaving will do to this family. I hate that we have to choose being independent and who we want to be and being disowned or being miserable leading w fake life with a family that you love"

You don’t need to keep anyone in your life that’s toxic, including family. I bet your dad could rape your sister, but you’d still respect him because in your country there’s so much regard for parents 😉"
