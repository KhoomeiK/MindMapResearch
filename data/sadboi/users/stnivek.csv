Like you said, often times we forget that our crafts often automatically get compared to something much bigger, because it's what most people are used to, as in the case of a high-schooler's indie games vs AAA games made by hundreds of people with budgets in the millions.

That was a good reminder, thank you for that. :) As someone who's always pursuing creative crafts as an outlet and not being naturally talented at that, it's good to remember that advice from time to time. At the end of the day, we're having fun expressing ourselves, and that's always been our main reason, so that's all that matters."

This is an excellent advice. When I was younger I used to make a lot of music. I was reserved at first, but after making some really good songs I gained the confidence that maybe it was time I showed my work.

Nobody was really that interested. Not long after, a group of people in college came up with a song that made some splash. People in my circle hyped it up. I was quietly upset because, not saying that my songs were that good, but that song was super cliche and had a bunch of grammar mistakes. It had 4 chords with a very simple progression.

What I failed to realize was that they were an established group. Their band was already known among their circles, and they made the song in a studio. They had a video for it and everything. It had a name behind it. It may be simple but it was polish and professionally mixed.

Marketing is everything. Popping out of nowhere and showing your friends your creative crafts don't work most of the time.

I was younger and stupider and for a while I thought I sucked. I poured my heart into my crafts and that burned me out for a while. Now I only show my stuff to only those who are close to me and are really interested and it's been better for my mental health."

1. I uninstalled both Python versions. Did a CC Cleaner to clean the registry.

2. Installed Python 64-bit through the site in my original question.

3. Added the Python path to windows. I used this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdUZArA-kZw) as a guide. It's a guide to install Pygame but go to the middle of the video where he teaches how to install Python first and place its PATH.

4. I went to the command prompt (to bring it up, type cmd on Windows search), and then typed ""python --version"". If it brings out the version number, that means it worked.

5. Then type ""python"". If it doesn't bring you to the Windows Store menu, then it worked. You now have 64-bit installed without the 32-bit, at least from my understanding."

The problem is, when I do installations of modules through ""pip install"", I'm not sure to which version of Python do they get installed.

I really just want to use the 64-bit but everytime I uninstalled the 32-bit, the command ""python"" on the cmd would always forced me to go to Windows Store to install the 32-bit, instead of working as the command intended.

Ah this is exactly the *for loop* code that I intended!!! Thank you so much!!!"
learnpython,foos0xf,t1_foorc7v,1587945237.0,"I see now. In that logic, if I use a range of numbers in a *for loop* (which I now realize is probably not what the loop is for), its iteration is always  1 by default, and cannot be overwriten by whatever declarations I put in (like x += 5), right?

I think I'm getting it now. The problem is I misunderstood how *for loop* works.

Thank you so much. This is a very important basic mistake of mine that needs to be corrected."
learnpython,foorfha,t1_foomw87,1587944874.0,"So what you're saying is, in *for loops* in general, the addition is *+= 1* by default? And this cannot be overwritten like what I was trying to do with *y += 2*?"
learnpython,fooqnyx,t1_foomki0,1587944412.0,"Ah so, by default,* for loop* will always add by 1, right, as long as it is within that range? Which means it sort of has a ""built-in""* += 1* that cannot be overwritten. Does it?

I feel so dumb now haha. Why didn't I think of using this. I guess it's because I wrote the *for loop* first, and when it didn't get the output I wanted, I changed it to *while loop*. I think declaring *x = 12* as a starting number, and then using:

*while x >= 12 and x < 30:*

would have worked the same, right?"
learnpython,fooq27h,t1_foomejv,1587944058.0,"Typing code questions on mobile is frustrating haha..

Both loops work, maybe reddit formatting ruins it.

But they yield different output. While loop adds x by 2, but for loop adds y by 1.

The output I want is the *while* output, which I initially expected to be the *for loop* output.

While output (that I want):

12

14

16

18

20

... and so on

28  
&nbsp;

Initially, above output is what I expected the *for loop* code would give me. Instead, this is the *for loop* output.

12

13

14

15

...and so on, it adds by 1 despite the* y += 2* line

27

28

29

What confuses me is, why doesn't the y+= 2 in the *for loop* works as I intended, which is adding the numbers by 2 (eg 12 14 16) instead of by 1 (12 13 14).

Also, why does the variable in the *while loops* need to be declared (as the starting number within the range) but in *for loop*, I can put the starting number without declaring it first?

Sorry if my question is also confusing. I want to blame my English but in reality I simply don't know how to word the question properly."

Coronavirus,foi2rx0,t1_foi1m11,1587777539.0,">but it doesn’t get the widespread media attention like the US does.

Indeed, since the internet news revolve a lot around what's going on in the US so it's easy to get a biased perception. 

That's good to know, the protests being not as widespread as the news make it out to be, that is."
Coronavirus,foi2d8o,t1_foi1luq,1587777304.0,"I see. I'm a bit relieved to hear that. The way they're portrayed by the media, it seems like it's widespread. That's why I asked here for some clarification outside of news and Youtube. Thanks for your reply."
Coronavirus,foi0vwo,t3_g78qo4,1587776445.0,"Hey. Hope everyone is staying safe. I have a question. This whole anti-lockdown, not-taking-the-pandemic-seriously and harrasing health workers thing, does this only happen widespread in the US? I just watched some footage on Youtube and it's so bizarre to me seeing these protesters cursing healthcare workers and talking about conspiracy stuff about freedom, etc.

Aside from very few idiots, we don't have these where I'm from. I do know in countries like India, there have been cases of people harassing healthcare workers, but other than that, I can't recall a widespread outrage like this happening in other countries but this could be because US news dominate the internet so I probably missed out a lot of other countries news.

Edit: I kinda remember now that there were some protests in Germany and the 5G conspiracy in Australia. But don't remember seeing anything as widespread as the protests in the US."

learnpython,fodso8g,t1_foby5ns,1587689395.0,"Hi! Same road as yours, I just finished Chapter 9 but moved away a bit because I had issues installimg the modules.

Which projects are giving you issues? For me, what works is making my own version of the projects in the syllabus. For example, the rock paper scissor one, I made a similar game but with a twist: it's an Infantry - Cavalry - Pikemen game that also updates scores. I learned a lot about loops from this project.

Going back to previous projects to modify them also helps. Add new things like the usage of functions or new commands. Some projects I skipped because admittedly I'm too dumb for them. Oh another project I did that helped me is a financial calculator project.

I also made a similar progress comment about my python learning track [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_Programmers/comments/g2iq0h/z/fnsd3f6), it's a pretty long comment but hopefully it helps."
learnpython,fodra0z,t1_fodqlku,1587688638.0,"Thanks for your reply. Oh you have no idea how overwhelming the whole process was. Appendix A made zero sense to me haha.

The other day I did saw that I had 2 idles. The ""default"" 32-bit and another 64-bit. I cannot find the root directory of the 32-bit, my only access to it is via typing it's name on the Start menu. If you don't mind, could you tell me how to remove it? I feel like it's confusing to have both. When I installed a module via cmd, I have no idea which version it registers to.

I migrated to VS Code and now my Python progress is stunted as I have to start learning to use VS Code and how to install Python modules to it. Otherwise I can't import any of the modules and hence continue with my Python learning using Automate's syllabus. Still haven't figured out all those module and extension so I ended up abandoning Automate's syllabus and am now learning Python OOP.

Any tips would be really appreciated especially your experience with Automate! :D"
