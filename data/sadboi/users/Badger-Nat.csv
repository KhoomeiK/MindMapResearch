askatherapist,fosfbal,t3_g9bm0i,1588029590.0,"Many of the psychiatric diagnoses represent an exaggeration of defenses and styles of coping that many people have. If you match some symptoms listed under BPD that doesn't mean you have a milder version of BPD. There has been a growing trend of people self-diagnosing with BPD and diagnosing others with NPD because they don't understand how mental health diagnoses work.

If the symptoms listed under BPD bother you, you can definitely bring up those symptoms to your psychiatrist or therapist and see what they make of them! If they're not a part of your treatment goals, you can add them to your treatment goals. Those symptoms might be explained by your generalized anxiety disorder or by other things that have happened to you (trauma, interpersonal stress, etc.)."

""Therapist"" mostly isn't a legally protected term so that's why it's hard to get a straight answer.

To be a licensed professional who treats mental health or relationship issues, you absolutely need a master's or higher degree. The most common licensable master's degrees are Social Work, Marriage and Family Therapy, and Counseling.

You can also practice as a PhD. You'd be a licensed psychologist, then. Psychiatrists (medical doctors) can also practice mental health therapy.

Assuming you mean jobs that are similar to therapy or clinical psych, at the bachelor's level you can work various positions in large clinics/agencies that have clear-cut hierarchies so that you'd be following protocols and treatment plans under a licensed professional. Common examples are doing intakes or leading groups for substance abuse treatment, doing in-home therapy for children on the autism spectrum, working in a psychiatric ward, or doing exposure therapies in an intensive outpatient program. You can also be a low level case manager at the bachelor's level, but this is more common for people with social work degrees."

Literally no person with a degree in a therapy-related field is like, ""gosh, therapists should be way more harsh and judgmental.""

I'd say it's present in some form among most therapies. When you see a clinician who's super burnt out and has lost the ability to maintain that strong regard for their clients, it's not a pretty sight.

I view unconditional positive regard and some other aspects of Carl Rogers' work as necessary pieces of a healthy/productive therapeutic relationship, but not *sufficient* aspects in many cases."

The two most common therapies that are designed to help people with reckless decision-making tendencies (DBT for personality disorders and Motivational Interviewing for substance abuse) involve special motivational techniques, but they still tend to involve unconditional positive regard (though often called something else).

If wake up calls, advice giving, direct confrontation, etc. worked then people wouldn't need to go to therapy because these already happen from friends, managers, TV, police, etc. all the time. Unconditional positive regard doesn't mean ""keep doing what you're doing,"" it just means ""you are fundamentally a person doing your best and there are reasons in life that you are the way you are. I accept that and I accept you as you are."" That can involve direct tools for change in the next phase of therapy, or the therapist can stick with humanistic/client-centered, but giving direct tools doesn't contradict positive regard."

I think that was written in a book that she or her kid wrote after the fact since the videos are really famous. 

So the lack of direct feedback or advice can be an important intervention in itself.

""The Body Keeps the Score"" and ""The Boy Who Was Raised as a Dog"" are both compelling books about the effects of trauma. They contain a lot of the same ideas. I preferred the latter one.

""In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts"" is an interesting one about trauma and addiction but the author has been criticized for way oversimplifying things and overly attributing addiction to trauma. 

""Buddha and the Borderline"" is a memoir about Borderline Personality Disorder by someone who had it. It helped me build a lot of empathy and intellectual curiosity about BPD. 

""IQ: Failed History of a Smart Idea"" is a good book heavily critiquing IQ and other measures of intelligence. The book comes off as really strong so I could see how some people think it overstates its points, but I still think it's good to keep the criticisms/shortcomings and history of those measures in mind as you learn about them.

askatherapist,follcsf,t3_g7qrtc,1587864736.0,"The most popular theory about BPD is that it's a combination of genetic vulnerability and a mismatch between the child's emotional needs and the environment's response. Sometimes this involves intense trauma (childhood sexual abuse, for example) and other times it involves persistent invalidation, maybe from a parent who is accidentally neglectful, has a mental illness of their own, has life problems that make responsive parenting a challenge, etc. 

The genetic risk is probably equal across populations, but the environmental risks might vary.

Research has found that symptoms of BPD exist in many different cultures, but the actual numbers are less certain. I don't think there's an answer right now. One problem is that the way we diagnose disorders is considered problematic and unreliable to begin with. Another problem is that the U.S. and the rest of the world use different diagnostic manuals."
AcademicPsychology,folk78h,t1_folj032,1587864011.0,"Also to answer your questions that are more about applications, the master's in counseling and social work tend to be very flexible about what you did in undergrad. They care less about undergrad degree (though do have prerequisite classes) and often look for work experience with vulnerable populations, such as volunteering with people who are homeless and have substance abuse issues, volunteering on a crisis line, working as a behavioral tech or CNA, etc. They also value certain personality traits and life experiences. We have people in our program coming directly from business and HR, even. 

These programs tend to be pretty flexible on admissions but the downside is that the education is a very generalist education and you're going to get most of your specialized training through hands-on experiences and formal trainings after you graduate. I don't know how else they'd do it in a degree that only takes 2-3 years though. With a PhD you'll be much more formally trained and have the beginning of a specialty area sorted out before you graduate. With counseling or social work you know how to ""sit in a room"" with someone and know the basics of ethics and treatment, but will learn much more about treatment of mental health issues via supervised experiences on your way to licensure."
AcademicPsychology,folj032,t3_g84wb3,1587863264.0,"Honestly I'm surprised that your friend got into a psych PhD without a psych major, but I work in the psych department of a very competitive school so maybe admissions work differently at other schools.

Most people on here are going to steer you away from a PsyD. PsyDs are typically not funded, which means you take on an enormous amount of debt (the median is $120,000). For some people, taking on that debt is worth it! For most, it isn't. PhDs are typically funded (at least the worthwhile programs are), so you spend a lot of extra time on research and TA-ing but you come out of the other side with far less debt.

PhD applications focus on research. When you apply, you're essentially applying to provide research to the professor under which you will be working, more than anything else. So you need to tailor your application to that. I'm very surprised that a program would accept someone without psych research experience, but maybe your friend leveraged research experience in another field? I'm also not super familiar with developmental psych. My work area is social psych and when I did my own school research I was looking at clinical psych programs. Clinical psych admissions tend to be intensely competitive and will definitely require GRE scores.

In terms of choices at the master's level, it's unlikely that an MFT would work with the populations you mention, but someone with a master's in social work or a master's in clinical mental health counseling could. There are many opportunities to work with those populations in intensive outpatient programs, partial day programs, and community mental health agencies. The downside is that at the master's level, those jobs have extremely high caseloads and productivity requirements, and put people at a high-risk of burn out. It's possible to find good jobs in community mental health, but they're the exception that proves the rule. If you have the resilience, though, then you can work with many different mental illnesses in many different settings with just a master's degree. Once you have a full license and experience under your belt, you can also work with these diagnoses in private practice in most states.

These master's degrees tend to be unfunded, but are less expensive than a PsyD and are only 2-3 years. If you're considering this route, most people recommend a master's in social work. I'm doing a master's in counseling and I'm happy with it, but social workers do have better advocacy for their profession and therefore more flexibility with their licenses and where they can work. Counseling is also a younger field and has had a lot of licensure requirement changes and challenges to their ability to diagnose and such. So far the counseling field has been expanding a lot, but it is a riskier degree than a social work degree."

tattoos,foijmma,t1_foihogo,1587788298.0,"If you're working on a big piece then the best form of planning is to pick a tattoo style and to pick what individual elements you might want.

Bring that info to your artist. IMO if you're feeling strongly indecisive after that then you might be rushing into a tattoo. 

I'm not gonna get in the way of you commissioning someone else, it's just an extra step that's not normally part of the process and that might become irrelevant depending on how the artist works.

This is important because style makes a huge difference. And tattoo artists know better how to fit designs to the body and know some design rules to ensure that the tattoo looks good over time, whereas random people who are good at drawing generally don't know.

If you plan to just get something that looks cool from them, then check out their flash options and think on it for a little while. If you don't like their flash then that's a sign that you shouldn't be getting a tattoo from them.

Also you should NOT pick a tattoo artist based on prices and rumors -- look at their portfolio of both fresh and healed stuff. It's totally possible that their tattoos are way cheaper just because they live in a country with a lower cost of living or a tougher market for tattoos, or it's also possible that this person doesn't do quality work.

Periods can and do cause mood swings in many people, though. So they could make your symptoms more pronounced or difficult to manage. 

But looking for one simple answer or key to your problems is unlikely to bring you good results. It's a trap that many people fall into. It is very rare for there to be one simple solution to or reason for complex mental health issues.

If you see a doctor you can ask about hormonal birth control. If you find a dosage that works for you (might take several tries), it can reduce mood swings by keeping hormone levels more consistent each month. Some people do get worse symptoms from hormonal birth control."
AcademicPsychology,fohbga7,t3_g7g1v1,1587763174.0,"I manage the piece of a large research project that exclusively does coding. 

The idea is that you read the transcript several times and see what themes emerge. ""Themes"" can mean a lot and depends entirely on your research. Were you given a research topic/question or just a transcript and no context?

A ""code"" is just a formal way to count up and notate themes so that you can do data analysis or report on these themes. 

For example a question could be ""what promotes resilience among people with generalized anxiety?"" and you interview 20 people with anxiety. Then you read through a few of the interviews (or all of them) and see what is coming up repeatedly. Once you have a sense for what's coming up a lot, you decide how to categorize the themes, and that's the basis of your code.

In the anxiety example, maybe several people mentioned ""breathing techniques,"" ""self forgiveness,"" ""radical acceptance,"" ""exercise,"" ""healthy routines,"" and ""social time."" Those are now your coding categories. You might set up a spreadsheet with each theme in its own column. For each transcript you look at, you'd go through each theme (column) and say ""yes"" or ""no"" on whether the theme was present. Usually these are represented with 1s and 0s. Or if you're just working on one transcript, you could use this coding scheme to count how often these ideas come up.

In formal research, there are extra procedures to make sure your code makes sense, but I don't know that you need to do that for a homework assignment.

Let me know if you have more questions. :)

Edit: I should add that my coding experience has been for very large amounts of data and our coding system was designed to add information to other parts of our research that use quantitative analysis. I think the resource that the other person linked is more useful if you're trying to go more in depth on a smaller sample and/or trying to see how different ideas relate to each other.

But if someone is eating a lot of mock meats, nuts, pasta, baked goods, etc. it's easy to gain weight.

If you want to lose weight you should portion out your food and track calories + nutrition for a week to get a sense of where you're at and what you can reduce/cut out. That's true for any eating, not just veganism. 

A healthy/sustainable rate of loss is about 1lb a week, though people can lose anywhere from 0.5 - 2.5lbs a week safely if overweight. If you only have a few pounds to lose then aiming for a slow and steady loss is generally better.

psychotherapy,fodvd7h,t3_g6yvqo,1587690833.0,"IMO the most fundamental stuff goes in the informed consent sheet, and things beyond that depend on modality, no? My practicum had ""risks and benefits"" and ""what is counseling"" sections in our consent document that went over the very basics.

Some of these were in our informed consent (worded differently) and some of these are me brainstorming:

* Sometimes things get a bit worse before they get better.
* Some sessions will feel good, and others might feel challenging; it can be hard to learn certain things about yourself or confront aspects of your past.
* It's normal for recovery/healing to involve ups and downs.
* If something about therapy isn't working for you, I want you to share that with me.
* If symptoms feel unmanageable between sessions, please tell me, and we can change our approach (slow down trauma processing, increase session frequency, etc.).
* Therapy is not the same as advice-giving. A lot of the reason therapy works the way it does is because I want you to be able to continue problem-solving and learning for yourself once therapy is over.  (I think this goes along with ""Therapy only works if you do."")
* \[clear boundaries/expectations about your policy for contact between sessions\]

Then I think there's modality and individual-specific stuff, particularly the role of homework, the level of structure of sessions, and the style of the counselor (are you coach-y and do a lot of psychoed, or are you more blank slate, or very warm and client-centered?).

Learning to find small things you enjoy and savoring those things in the present can really increase quality of life. This is why yoga, meditation, mindfulness, etc. get pushed so much, but they are not the only options. Additionally, clarifying your values and how you can extract meaning from your life is also important and makes a big difference in quality of life. These things are what allow for resilience in people who are in awful circumstances, and they can be cultivated in individuals even while we still push for systemic changes.

YET at the same time, it is really hard to do those things when you're focused on survival. We actually know that chronic stress leads to increased cortisol levels, and those can inhibit certain parts of your emotional and cognitive functioning. So it's easy for my somewhat financially secure butt to be telling you to be mindful and try to savor things in the present when I'm not about to be homeless every month.

I don't know what I can say to you to be helpful. I'm drawing a bit from DBT here and thinking of the middle path -- that you can acknowledge that life is unfair and that you're in really shitty circumstances, while also acknowledging that you've grown a lot as a person and you're on a journey of cultivating resilience; acknowledging that right now you're in a phase that is just ""less bad"" and it still feels like you're struggling, and that you might one day reach a phase that is actively good. I think psychotherapy could still play an important role in your life but absolutely understand how you'd prioritize financial counseling for now and revisit psychotherapy later.

And now speaking 100% as a peer with political opinions and not as a counseling student: I'm a staunch Atheist but also a humanist. I reject antinatalism and nihilism because I think it's nonsensical for a human brain (me) to not value other human brains, when I know full well that my species has evolved for millions of years to be a cooperative species that values its own survival. My meat suit and my brain evolved to derive pleasure from other humans and to enjoy working for the betterment of my species. I'm not going to cultivate a philosophy that goes against my self interests and the interests of my species. Most of the ""evils"" of humanity (rape, violence, etc.) are worse in other predator species or have been exacerbated by systems such as capitalism (climate change, imperialism, world hunger). So I'd rather endorse a philosophy that emphasizes cultivating my own wellbeing and the wellbeing of other people than wallowing in the fact that the Universe doesn't have a divine plan for us. I do think it's MUCH harder to cultivate a decent quality of life if you're focused on a version of nihilism that is anti-human. That's just my 2 cents though :)"

I would say this isn't typical. There are kind of 2 ""prongs"" to this.

How she's approaching the whole weight loss thing: Body weight is often a symptom or side effect of mental health problems (trauma, OCD, eating disorders, depression to name a few). It can also reinforce mental health problems (sometimes limits what self-care and social activities one can do). It is therefore common for body weight to be a topic in therapy, and it can't go ignored forever. But giving you direct advice about counting calories and exercising seems a little bit ""iffy."" I was taught that this kind of advice is out of my scope of practice. If a client came in with an explicit goal about a significant amount of weight, then I'd want to work with a dietitian or doctor on that plan. Whenever a client needs to gain or lose a lot, then that means significantly changing how they eat, and I do not have the expertise to advise them on that. (It'd be different if they just needed to cut back on stress eating or midnight snacks, of course.) Sometimes you also need to rule out other medical issues, and I of course cannot do that as a therapist. So that's one concerning piece.

Then there's the part about *why* she's approaching the weight loss thing. It sounds like this isn't something you want to work on right now. Have you expressed this directly and clearly to her? There might be a miscommunication going on. Either way, it sounds like this therapist has some biases around weight... but she might be able to reign those in if you both can get on the same page about goals.

If you've been super clear that your goal is to work on depression first, weight later, then I find her approach pretty concerning because she's not hearing what you want -- which is really important -- and she's not really going about this the right way even if weight did need to be a priority."

There are also unacknowledged aspects of our system that affect people's mental health in deeper ways. For example, families live in smaller units than they have for most of human history, and they are more disconnected from their neighbors than what has been normal for most of human history. It's also more common for young people to move far from home, decreasing the support that's available to them. Our mental health is also deeply impacted by the fact that a full time work week is now 40 hours + significant commuting time + semi-obligatory work outside of those 40 hours. People no longer remain in the same job for several decades, which erodes one's general sense of security. Etc. etc. etc. These are all challenges that are fairly new to humanity and that go unacknowledged because people seem to think that 1950s and 1960s capitalism is an accurate representation of what is ""normal"" and ""traditional.""

A therapist or other professional who specializes in career counseling can help you explore careers and help you learn more about financial planning, budgeting, and the job market. Usually folks who know this area very well don't do mental health therapy, because they have to spend a lot of effort staying well-researched about current job trends. It's its own specialty area. Maybe that's what you're looking for? They can't fix the world or the job market for you, they can only help you figure out what options you have.

The way I see it, psychotherapy's role when it comes to this particular problem is to help people function as healthily as possible and make the most out of the life they have, and to help people become aware of what's within their control and outside of their control in the present and foreseeable future. I think that if people are mentally healthier and can correctly identify what problems are individual and what problems are systemic, they are more likely to organize and make changes to the system that benefit everyone. But I can't make big systemic changes happen via one-on-one therapy.

I also want to add that your circumstances and your present frustration don't mean that you haven't made progress in therapy. A lot of people tend to dismiss the progress they made for all sorts of different reasons. It can be true that you have both made progress AND are still in shitty circumstances. I don't know your life, current mental health symptoms and risk level, etc., but it sounds like a viable option for you right now would be to work on summarizing what you HAVE achieved in therapy over the years, and then seeking out some financial counseling as you wrap up college, and then saving that money for other uses?"

Therapy isn't always supposed to be something you look forward to and something that feels good. In my personal view it wouldn't be good to take a break from therapy out of frustration, because that's acting in an avoidant way and potentially reinforcing patterns of avoidance or low frustration tolerance in your ""real life."" I think it's worth exploring the frustration more, because this could be a big growth opportunity. To me it just doesn't make sense to quit therapy if therapy is bringing up a big emotion for you (frustration) and you feel you have a good relationship with your therapist.

As a client, I've taken breaks when life crises have come up and I'm on break now because I don't want teletherapy. But I'm not in therapy for specific issues at this point, I'm in therapy as a long term personal growth thing (and because therapists should be in ongoing therapy to manage their reactions to clients)."

These are clients/patients with trauma history and moderate-to-severe mental illness, usually.

She said it's more common for people to start cancelling appointments or reduce appointment frequency then to naturally stop showing up on their own, or to switch to just doing ""check-ins"" (leaving voicemails/emails every few months with an update on how they're doing), or to say they're considering ending therapy then not actually show up for a formal termination, etc. Or she's known clients who tend to stop showing up when things are good, and to come back when things are going badly (which suggests that there is an important bond there!).

As you can see, though, about half of people's depression also doesn't fully remit with therapy alone. That's when meds are indicated. It sounds like you found a combo that worked really well for you and it's unfortunate that your parents withdrew you from the meds. 

I'm obviously biased because I'm training to become a therapist (currently a student, I am not licensed), but to me if someone has depression then there aren't ""no problems to work on in therapy"" -- depression is the problem and a treatment plan would be developed for that.

>What is the good pace & frequency of the therapy? Is it expected first few sessions to be a story-telling?

Most of therapy will involve you talking much more than the therapist. It's normal for the first few sessions to involve you summarizing a lot of your life so that the therapist understands your background. How therapy will feel after those first few sessions depends on the therapist's approach and your reasons for being in therapy; there will always be some ""story-telling,"" but some therapists might add guided activities and directly working on skills, whereas other therapists might support you in ""story-telling"" only. Pace and frequency depends on your needs and the therapist's approach. 

&#x200B;

>How to see if the therapist is suitable for me, e.g. to decide whether to continue or stop/change?

If you feel comfortable sharing with them and you feel that they understand you and where you're coming from, that's a good sign. If you and the therapist can agree on goals for your therapy, that's another good sign. The final issue would be how much structure you want and need, versus how much structure the therapist is willing to provide. That is something you could ask them about. Some therapies involve you story-telling for many sessions, and the therapist very slowly helping you realize things about yourself. Other therapies involve actively teaching you things and encouraging you to go practice them in your life. You might want to figure out what approach your therapist tends to take and decide whether that sounds good to you.

&#x200B;

>Is it fine if I learn from other sources and discuss what I thought with the therapist? Will it mess up with the therapy program?

It's fine, but a common problem is that when people read about psychology, they tend to feel that everything applies to them and their situation. For example, people diagnosing others as ""narcissists"" is a trend right now, and people are often incorrect in doing so. So learning and reading is great, but be careful about labeling yourself or other people in your life with some of the ideas you learn about. Your therapist might also make reading and video recommendations if you ask! Mine does, because I only see her 2x per month. She has recommended things that I wouldn't have thought about for myself, which have been very helpful.

&#x200B;

>Can I tell my therapist what area I expect to work out? Or will she point it out?

Yes! You should tell her and see if she agrees so that you can both work on goals together. Sometimes therapists might help you notice other goals, but you should still have at least a loose idea about why you're there and what you're working on."
AcademicPsychology,fnzwbce,t3_g4w90r,1587401866.0,"disclaimer: I'm not a PhD student but I manage a lab alongside PhD students and have helped a P.I. (professor who runs a research study) during the application process.

Get as much research experience as possible. At your university, try a few different labs if you can, and then go ""in depth"" in a lab that you like. Try to publish an undergraduate thesis if that's an opportunity that you have. I'm not sure about other Universities but that seems almost expected at mine. Grad schools want to know that you are able to formulate new questions and think about how to formally test those questions.

When you apply to graduate schools for a PhD, you will basically be applying to specific professors to work in their research area (which is a very different process than applying for undergrad work). Don't worry about that now, as that's super far away. But it's good information to keep in your back pocket because I had no idea that that's how it worked until a few years into my University. The application process isn't about saying, ""hey I'm good at school,"" at that point, it's about conveying that you have the knowledge and interest to formulate new research questions in a very specific area.

Also keep in mind that many people have a gap between their undergraduate University work and when they start a PhD. Some people work in research during the gap, and others might do a Master's that focuses on research methods or data analysis.

Also keep in mind that the percentage of PhD students who go on to stay in academia is extremely low. The field is *very* competitive and there are far more people with PhDs than available jobs in academia. Planning to go into academia isn't actually a very ""secure"" career plan even if it sounds like it should be. So keep your mind open when you're in University, and consider pursuing a research area that could serve you in a non-academic profession as well (i.e. a clinical PhD that would allow you to stay in academia or work as a clinical psychologist, or an industrial-type PhD that would allow you the option to work in management and business consultation).

I was seeing clients through a very tightly supervised practicum that takes place in our school for one semester before we go to agencies for internships. So the decisions I'm describing are for that situation, which is much more limited than most situations.

I'm not sure exactly how volunteering works for a licensed clinician. I think it's something you'd need to consult with a lawyer on and it would probably depend by state/government because regulatory bodies have different description of scopes for different professions. I don't know how they handle it when the scope of a profession also applies to everyday life. For example we obviously know that a nurse who's cleaning and applying a bandaid to her wounded child isn't taking on any liability as a nurse. Same applies for counselors giving ""emotional support"" to people.

I also think you can probably write up a document to exempt you of liability, but that the profession might frown on that as unethical even if it's legal. I.E. a document that says ""I am not acting as a counselor, I am a volunteer peer facilitator"" etc. etc.

During all of this, I have been an emotional support volunteer one-on-one over text during this crisis and I'm allowed to do that; I simply never mentioned to the person I'm supporting that I am a counseling student, and I made it clear I was just doing check-ins as a peer. I have also never given them mental health diagnoses or advice. There are also licensed counselors who volunteer on crisis lines without taking on a higher level of liability than any other volunteer because they never share that they're a professional with the person calling in, and therefore they are in the exact same role as any other volunteer. I think the issue is when there's an imbalanced power dynamic or implication that you have special knowledge, I think. It puts you in an expert role, which involves liability. So me running a group where we have activities that I brought as ice breakers might accidentally put me in a leadership role, that would then feel linked to my counseling background if people knew I was studying to be a counselor. I'm not sure.

I think my school is just being extra careful. I think if you're a licensed counselor there's a lot of grey area that makes it fine to volunteer in most cases. All the talk of liability is pretty cynical, though I don't think it's our faults that we feel the need to be cynical."

So I can run a group if I say very clearly that I'm not a counselor and not acting as a counseling student or counselor in training. But then I have to run the group as if I was untrained in group facilitation/counseling, or at least I think that's what my program was getting at. I was told that if I did run a group, it should be open, not involve screening, not involve structured activities or me ""leading"" anything, etc. to avoid me doing counselor stuff.

But it's kind of weird because a layperson can learn group facilitation skills too. So in a way I have less flexibility than an untrained volunteer does.

The gist is that I really need to avoid practicing within the ""scope"" of a counselor while I'm in this grey area of ""being a counselor."" But my program didn't consult with a lawyer or anything, everyone just kind of took a guess based on their years of clinical experience and such.

The thing stopping you from talking to someone on Zoom for money is that if you talk to them within the ""scope"" of what a counselor does and establish a counselor-client relationship with them, now all the professional ethics and legal liabilities apply.

Maybe some of your friends would be interested in doing that? It's on Wednesday nights. Some weeks are themed and others aren't, and it's the exact same question and point style as League Trivia. You sign up with a team and all. Can PM you with more info if you want. The only downside is how heavily it relies on an honors system (in terms of not looking up answers) -- there's been very mild drama about that. But it's still fun. Playing Trivia and jackbox has helped me feel a bit less alone and reminds me of hanging out with pals and beer.

I hope you get more tips from others, esp. current students."

Is that what the assignment is looking for? I've had assignments where I've had to describe how they made the instruments and determined the items and scoring system. Usually the info is simply in the front of the manual but you can also use regular research methods to find some of the studies. Otherwise my program did teach me a method of assessing whether a score went down over time for a single subject using ""non overlap"" methods (it involved graphing scores over time and counting points within a range and outside of a range) but that seems like a big ask if your program never taught you?"
askatherapist,fnsl13q,t3_g2sslj,1587223796.0,"Couples and family therapy are their own specialty areas and have their own theories distinct but overlapping from individual therapy theories.

My favorite couple-specific theory is EFT (see Sue Johnson, as there are several therapies that are called EFT), which is based in attachment theory. Gottman Method is another therapy that is distinctively designed for couples, and it's VERY different from EFT so looking at those two might be interesting from a learning perspective.

Then there are a lot of models of family therapy that can be applied to couples as well."

It is good that you want to be a supportive friend, and sometimes being a supportive friend means carving out time to listen to someone else. A good starting point is active listening skills:  [https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/coaching-others-use-active-listening-skills/](https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/coaching-others-use-active-listening-skills/)

But it is NOT ethical to imply that your psych background or hobby interest in therapy makes you anything more than a caring friend. It is not a good idea to set up a standing appointment to talk about ""her issues"" as if this is a therapy session. This makes boundaries extremely confusing. And you shouldn't be surprised that she jokes around and gets awkward, because you are NOT a therapist and are not qualified to be doing this, and you are not bound by ethics or confidentiality, you're not receiving supervision, and you have no training in helping people with self harm or suicidality.

Again, listening ear = fine. ""makeshift therapy"" / trying to imply that boundaries and expectations of therapy exist in a friendship / implying that you're more qualified than other friends to help her = not okay at all, and potentially actively harmful"
askatherapist,fnrh0o9,t1_fnrea3q,1587188689.0,"I think it really depends on the situation and your values. With stuff like that, you'd need to explore your values and goals in life, and explore the degree to which your anxiety is interfering with that. Then that informs what you're going to do about the anxiety. If it's only interfering in that one situation (boss being a jerk), then one might just work on skills to navigate those situations at work, and build up the practice of caring about things within your control and letting go of things outside of your control.

I don't think there's universal concrete advice on learning to let go -- there are different ways to build this skill up and everyone finds something different that works for them. Some examples are venting or writing out a journal then choosing to no longer think about the thing because it's been ""processed,"" going for a walk after an interaction to calm yourself down, using yoga or meditation to regulate your body, using record keeping from CBT or Mi-CBT to practice noticing and managing the way you react to things in general, exercising after work so that you burn off that anxious/tense energy before coming home, etc.

I think the one universal of ""letting go"" is that as you practice the skill, it does become somewhat easier over time. Sometimes it's easier to practice ""letting go"" with something less emotionally charged, and then applying it to harder areas once you've found the skillset that works for you.

edit: it's also worth noting that a different therapist with a different orientation might say something entirely different about this. They might focus on why your boss reminds you of your mother, and focus on catharsis and inner exploration about your relationship with your mother, and hope that ""processing"" that stuff helps you become less reactive to future people with similar traits"
TalkTherapy,fnra3qu,t1_fnr8wgo,1587183106.0,"CBT and exposure therapy don't involve acceptance of the anxiety and they have a long legacy of being evidence-based. They do involve ""not avoiding symptoms"" but that is not the same as acceptance or meditation."
askatherapist,fnr9koz,t3_g3gy6h,1587182714.0,"am a counseling student (master's), not a licensed therapist

With anxiety and panic, the symptoms become worse and worse as you try to avoid them and it creates a cycle. Reducing anxiety will always involve exposing yourself to anxiety-inducing situations and managing yourself until your symptoms fade away. 

How exactly you build up to that depends. There are many approaches. This is something that a therapist with training in anxiety, phobia, and panic disorders can help with. 

The process usually involves learning deep breathing to regulate your body, and practicing other skills to manage your specific anxiety symptoms in-the-moment. It may also involve reflecting on what kinds of anxious thoughts you have, how realistic they are, where they might have come from, how you can gain distance from them, how you can change them, and more, depending on what kind of approach the therapist uses.

After that ground work is done, you would think through situations from least triggering to most triggering. You'd then work through those situations in real life if the situations are safe to try (for example, practicing ordering in a coffee shop is a very safe thing for someone with social anxiety to try). Situations that aren't safe might be worked through using video, role-plays, etc.

If you try to expose yourself to anxiety-inducing situations but don't have the skills and other ground work to manage the symptoms that come up, it can backfire and make your symptoms worse. So that's often why having someone else help you with the process is beneficial. There are self-help books out there if therapy isn't attainable for you. These are less effective than in-person therapy but can still be more helpful and provide more structure than trying these changes completely alone.

tl;dr, honestly, anxiety treatment for issues with specific triggers basically boils down to ""do the triggering stuff if safe, while deep breathing until you calm down"" but therapy adds a lot of structure and preparation to ensure that this goes smoothly."
TalkTherapy,fnr8laz,t1_fnprjiw,1587181994.0,"Why say ""the only solution to that is to accept anxiety"" when that's not what the research evidence shows? 

A lot of psych students and just psych hobbyists in general seem to generalize their own experiences to everyone else incorrectly. Just because acceptance and meditation worked the best for you or seem to make the most sense to you intuitively, doesn't mean that those are the best ways for everyone. That's why research is conducted, and research has shown that different therapy approaches have different levels of effectiveness and operate on different timelines, even if some of the universal factors of therapy (human connection etc.) are nearly always present and have a baseline effect. 

If meditation worked for everyone without additional assistance then no one would show up and pay for therapy. Some people are able to start up meditation on their own and achieve results on their own (or with support from books, videos, what have you), others are able to start up meditation during or after an experience in therapy, and others never grasp or enjoy meditation and prefer tackling their issues from another approach. Just because you personally disagree with those other approaches doesn't mean they're clinically less effective."

Regarding this part:

>I feel like it would maybe help to have a sort of flowchart for when to reach out to them

Some therapists help clients draft safety plans that involve detailed steps, such as:

1. Situations or emotions that are triggering
2. How you know that you are at risk of self-harming (what feelings happen in your body? what thoughts seem to pop up?)
3. Series of coping skills you can try first; things to do and things not to do; healthy things to remind yourself
4. How you know that those are working or not working to reduce the urges
5. People you can reach out to, maybe friends first then therapist?
6. How you know that those did or didn't work
7. More urgent resources (crisis lines, 9-1-1) if none of that worked and you're feeling suicidal or have engaged in self-harm that is medically dangerous

They're not visually laid out like a flow chart, but this is something you could work on with your therapist or even on your own when you're in a state of calm, to help you make a decision when you're feeling overwhelmed. You could also clarify those boundaries with your T, and even ask where they should be in this plan."

You could try AskNeuroscience, but the answer is SUPER complicated and depends completely on which areas we're talking about.

I'm not sure it's helpful to think about this as weird or not weird.

Therapists do need to take steps to ensure that the session and the course of therapy stay focused on you. Some therapists keep super tight boundaries whereas others might share a little bit more about themselves to help the client feel more at ease. So different therapists are going to answer ""how are you"" differently. But ultimately they shouldn't be revealing anything about themselves that would cause you to feel preoccupied about their well-being. 

I don't think it's weird to ask that question because like you said, it's basically a standard social courtesy. But it sounds like it's not productive for your sessions with this particular therapist."

In terms of what I'd do as a clinician or what you could work on, it really depends on your current issues. Do these deeply held beliefs drive current dysfunctional behaviors? For example, sabotaging healthy relationships? Engaging in risky/dangerous sexual behaviors that you wish you didn't engage in? Deliberately isolating yourself? Then therapy could potentially focus on managing those first then exploring the deeper stuff. I think I've seen at least one study where CBT/DBT was applied to internalized homophobia. CBT focuses on pretty concrete changes, and then sometimes uses that momentum to dive down into deeper stuff too. Lots of other therapy modalities could be applied though! 

If you're mostly pleased with where your life is, and these beliefs come up as a ""sometimes"" thing (maybe holding you back in a more abstract sense, driving occasional depressive episodes, etc.) then I'd focus on building on strengths, resilience, self-care, healthy relationship skills, and healthy connections to other community members. I'd also devote a significant chunk of time in the therapy room to support you in venting and having that pain validated if you needed that.

askatherapist,fne60u5,t3_g18mq6,1586883675.0,"Hi -- I'm a current student in a Master's program for Clinical Mental Health Counseling. When I'm done with my degree, I would be on track to become a licensed professional counselor. (That's one of 3 or 4 types of practitioners who can be ""therapists"" in the U.S.)

Our degree is very much a ""generalist"" degree. So the answer to your question is that we barely learn about LGBTQ+ issues (in my opinion), but we also don't go in-depth on any groups of people as part of our class curricula. People are encouraged to cultivate that knowledge through other experiences (internship, supervision, readings, extra trainings, etc.)

In my program, which is accredited, we talk about LGBTQ+ issues in many classes when relevant, but we never take a class explicitly focused on LGBTQ+ issues or even sexuality in general. I think this is a major shortcoming; most states don't require that counselors have a specific sexuality/sex therapy course.

For example, we'll talk about LGBTQ+ identity when we learn about gender and sexual identity in our Development Across the Lifespan class, but that is a class that talks about all psychological aspects of human growth from infancy all the way up to death, so the LGBTQ+ content makes up a tiny part of the class. Similarly, in Diagnosis we briefly learn about diagnosing gender dysphoria and about the loaded history of the diagnosis, but we're covering entire clusters of disorders per week. In our multicultural class, we learn about LGBTQ+ matters as an area of potential bias. In our trauma class, we learn about the types of traumas that are statistically more likely among LGBTQ+ people and how those are taken less seriously by the justice system, Etc. Etc. But we don't receive a ton of training on how to best support any one group of people, and that includes LGBTQ+ people.

For counselors, a lot of training and expertise comes more from hands-on practice in the field and extra trainings on specific therapies that a counselor seeks after their master's."
