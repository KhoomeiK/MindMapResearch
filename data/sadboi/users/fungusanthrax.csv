OfficePolitics,fdf9rvx,t3_ekv3ye,1578356630.0,"The Games People Play by Eric Berne is a great book I think you may find useful. He talks a lot about our impulsiveness to wanting to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù someone and let all Hell loose as part of a social interaction as a way we survive. What your colleague gets from this is social interaction. Berne suggests it‚Äôs common for one to feel it is better to get some kind of acknowledgement than none. As for the quick questions, the book‚Äôs vibe said we, like Freud described, had more than one psyche. Freud called it the id. I like Freud‚Äôs: adult, child, and parent. You already called which version of herself she was being! Probably with who she raised her. She may not even know she‚Äôs asking a lot of questions a bit hostile. Well. Just my 5c."

MakeMeSuffer,f551795,t1_f51mg13,1571996988.0,"a few things need to happen before a mushroom sprouts. there are differences between different kinds, but i'll explain what happens in general. 1. there needs to be mushroom spores in a place that fosters growth. 2. the spores need to colonize the thing that fosters growth, essentially building strands upon strands through the porous material/food. 3. there's a light shock to the mushroom which lets the mushroom know it is ready to fruit.   


I find it hard to believe this is real. To answer other peoples' questions sake for many reasons. 1. not enough visible colonized material to make those mushrooms of that size and length. 2. not sure the composition of cum, but anything with sodium is not going to be good for a growing mushroom since that would dehydrate the mycelium (the spore strands). 3. if it's been washed once it's guaranteed the spores were killed off.  4. think about it lol"
