The first time I saw him I had just woken up from a dream and he sat in the corner of my room. He looked up from his hat and cocked his head to side with a face so devoid of emotion it gave me chills.

I started freaking out asking this guy why he was in my room and all he did was say, You'll never wake up.

And then I woke up again. So relieved it was a dream. But there he was still sitting in the corner but closer. He said it's no use you'll never wake up.

After going throught this cycle about 7 or 8 times I finally ""woke up""

I ran out of my room and searched for my brother and my husband. 

I described the man and what happened. 

This was about 7 years ago.


Now he stalks when I'm awake and when I sleep.
My dreams are so uncomforting. Hes always searching for me but it's like I have this veil over me for the moment but when he does see me I wake up.

Or sometimes in my dreams i see him out of the corner of my eye outside a window or in a closet.

When I'm awake I see shadows all the time. The best way I can describe it is Living shadows, 3D like.
These shadows usually assemble and form him.
Before I see the shadows though I always hear bells.
Like someone is ringing an old handbell. 

I usually run and hide and lock myself in my closet for about six hours. (Cant see the shadow man if everything is dark) 

Other times I'll see and feel bugs crawling in and out of my skin and I just know it's him coming after me.

I don't know if he's evil or not but he is my living night terror and I would give almost anything to be free of him.

I wake up most days not knowing if I'm really awake or not.

Sometimes my reality seems so distorted I can't even walk straight. My husband says on those days Im like a game that is skipping. My movements are slowed and sometimes repeated like I'm trapped in a daze that he can't wake me from.

I just want to be better. And I just want him gone.

If worst comes to it, and you feel they are a danger to themselves, yourself, or others or that their symptoms are progressing farther, then take them to the ER.

It's to hard to drive to work when your vision twist and you drive into oncoming traffic.

My abilify prescription costs me about 900 us dollars not including tax. With a coupon i can usually get $50 off.

That is one of my medications.

Abilify 
Clonodine
Trilepetal
Trazodone 
Strattera 
And Klonopin 

Look up the meds, they're not cheap.

I am currently out of meds and can not afford anymore for next month. My doctor also retired and with lack of insurance I can't even get a new doctor to even prescribe me the medication I take.

I tried for medicare but I have literally been screamed at over the phone and in person (was driven there) with the person shouting saying ""get a job""  ""Schizophrenia isn't a disability you can get financial assistance for"", ""Apply yourself more and you'll be able to work"" or ""I'm sorry I need your  medical paper work to be dated for this month for it to be vaild(doctors notes explicitly detailing my hallucinations and that I require assistance with travel)""

...but you know damn well the moment i get behind the wheel of a car and try to work again im gonna end up accidentally hurting someone...and those same people are going to say ""it's your fault. You shouldn't have been working.  You shouldn't have been driving. You should have been taking your meds. This is 100% your fault.""

Either I drive to work and eat (risk hurting someone or myself again) or stay at home and starve.

My cousin is a paranoid schizophrenic and I am schizoaffective. 

When ever she talks shes also so shut in, afraid of the world and entranced in her world.

If she texts.
The most she'll say is ""okay. K. Hi. No. Bye.""

She only responds to the occasional phone call she'll answer from family.

For me, my interactions mainly consists pf me freaking out because I can see and feel bugs crawling in my skin. So I feak out about freaking out because I don't want to make a scene in public or around friends.

So when things get bad I lock my self in my closet for a few hours. If im in public i try to find a public bathroom before things 'really take off'
Sometimes it gets so bad and I can't make it to a place to lock myself away in (while in public) and end up accidentally walk into oncoming traffic or something of the sort because pf how badly my world has warped. 

This makes me a shut in mostly. Hard to keep a job when you drive/walk into oncoming traffic.
Hard to keep friends when you start flipping out amd stipping naked shouting ""get them off me""

And for me mostly, there's the fear that the shadow man will send bugs after my family instead of me. So if i suffer with the bugs they wont have to. It's me he wants to never wake up, why would I put my family at risk?

Edit: TL,DR it DOES affect your social interactions including but not limited to datting, marriage, friends, work. Sometimes the person will seem devoid but thats not the case at all.

Edit 2: sorry my autocorrect is a bit touchy and keeps changing words as i type them. (Also, typing from mobile)"
schizophrenia,f4rl4sh,t3_dlkynk,1571768903.0,"As a young adult abilify amplified my depressive sperts and made me want to (in the literal sense of the word) blow my brains out.(taking it as prescribed for schizoaffective) 

As an adult i find it quite effective. My only advice is to stay away from it unless your in you 20 somethings.

I think it even has a description on the side about side effects (increased suicidal thoughts in teens and young adults)

As for sharing that kind of info, For me personally, i hate people being all up in my business so the only people that know are my husband and brother.
(Aside from anonymously sharing stories on reddit that can not be linked to my real identity)
Its a good way to vent about your illness without people downplaying you as a person and having the info to hold over your head for any reason."
