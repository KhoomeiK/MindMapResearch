It seems like the people saying yta must have missed the part where you told your gf you didn’t want anything big and was fine with having a few beers and hanging out with friends and the part where your gf knew that your close friends had something planned for you and was trying to keep you away from them with the wild idea of drinking on a raft in the winter. That right there sounds like a last minute plan to keep you away from your friends.

 Like she had planned the escape room thing first, then found out your buddies wanted to do something with you too (something you mentioned that you would enjoy), then she planned the honestly stupid idea to keep you away longer. Obviously she doesn’t know you better than your friends do.

You are NTA here and neither are your buddies.
If she really wanted “us” time then she should have planned something for just the two of you and not “mutual friends” who I’m assuming are her friends. 

What you need to do though is sit her down and explain that while you did have fun with her and mutual friends doing the escape room, you also enjoyed hanging out with your buddies, and if she wanted to do something one on one you can plan something together. However, she shouldn’t try to keep you away from your friends and shouldn’t be upset if you choose to hang out with them over her.
