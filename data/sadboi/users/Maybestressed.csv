Also people who weren’t aware about my surgery would pinch my nose playfully before I even turn 6 months post op. My surgeon would open the nostrils very widely with a tool like a eyebrow tweezer when I was having follow ups and I got terrified it may harm the result. You can see on the pics my nose didn’t get altered or broken.
