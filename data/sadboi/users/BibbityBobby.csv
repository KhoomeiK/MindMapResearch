Society does not support families who are struggling with conditions like this -- we just assume parents must be automatically able to cope with whatever their kids are dealing with. Parents often act out of guilt -- they think they are to blame for the medical and developmental conditions their child is born with, when they are not. So they try to make up for it by overindulging and making excuses for the child, which, as you know first-hand, can create a person with a warped view of his or her place in the world.

needadvice,fkmn60g,t3_fjdfeg,1584333462.0,"You are not alone in worrying about what is going to happen, and it doesn't help that so many of us who have chosen to self-isolate to try not to become part of the problem, now have a lot more time to think about the worst thing that could happen. It's called 'rumination' and it is a very easy trap to fall into. It makes us more anxious and worried and it doesn't solve anything -- but it is a very human thing to do. Our brains are meant to solve problems and in general tend to be more negative than positive (survival instinct!) So let me suggest a few things to help.

1. Exercise. Running, yoga, calisthenics, weights if you have them. It will help, trust me.
2. Download an app that is meant to help with anxiety. There are lots, and they usually involve writing down your thoughts and worries and then looking at them logically to decide how realistic they are. (Hint: they usually aren't.) You are then given the opportunity to counter those thoughts and worries with more rational thoughts. Most importantly it is vital to get out it of your head and onto some paper.
3. Plan for when this is over. And it will be over.
4. Give yourself a break. This is an unprecedented world event, and if you need to vent or ball your eyes out -- do it.
5. You sound like a close and loving family. And the thing with close and loving families is -- they always always always make it through. Your parents are worried because that's what parents always do, but deep down they know they will figure it out. What's happening for many people right now is the lack of information, including how the government and businesses are going to help people get back on their feet, is very challenging to cope with. But it is there and it is coming, especially information to help people like your Dad plan. The government wants people to remain as stable as possible so that it will be an easier transition back to normal life when this ends.  And Air Canada ain't going anywhere. And it's going to need its pilots when the planes start filling up again.
6. Seriously shut off your computer and television. The information is repetitive and at a complete saturation level.  Even newsrooms are telling their reporters to shut it off when they go home -- and these are people used to dealing with lots of negative information all the time, all day long. It's a rabbit hole with no bottom. Don't go down there.

Let me end by saying that when I was almost your age there was a nuclear power plant accident in the U.S., called Three Mile Island. At that time most people didn't know much about how catastrophic it could be if one of these plants broke down. But we learned fast, mainly because there was a movie released around the same time called The China Syndrome, which was eerily similar to what was happening for real.

I was terrified. It was an awful feeling. I've never forgotten it. So I seriously know what you are going through. You are human and worried about your loved ones. Yup. Human.

Best to you and your family!"

AmItheAsshole,fklo0ul,t3_fj2cu1,1584310829.0,"NAH -- yet. Best idea is to go see the bridesmaid/friend and say, ""We've got to figure out what to do about your dress for the wedding -- do you have any ideas?"" And then leave it up to the BM to come up with a solution, and if she can't then hopefully she will be mature enough to drop out herself or ask for another role. If BM says, ""We can put some panels in so it fits,"" then Bride needs to ask her to pay for the alterations. Give the BM as many outs as possible. 

Downside is if BM goes all passive/aggressive and pretends to have no ideas or responsibility. Then Bride may have to gently ask her if she would take another roll. It is totally unreasonable for the BM to expect the Bride to jump through hoops to accommodate what is essentially the BM's problem."

I've had the flu plenty of times but I've never had a dry cough with difficulty breathing and a tightness in the chest -- or the lengthy recovery time and lingering fatigue. But I've also never had bronchitis or pneumonia, even as the result of the flu so maybe those symptoms can also accompany the yearly flu and they just blended in?"
