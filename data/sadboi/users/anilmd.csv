DopamineDetoxing,fprcmhu,t3_gf331k,1588850279.0,"(1) Basically the whole purpose of detox is to understand how you were spending your time before detox and to understand which all sources of dopamine are unnecessary after the detox to start with. (2) It is usually done every Sunday because a holiday would be great for a ""reset"", however there is no hard and fast rule for picking the date. (3) people do it 12 hrs, 24 hrs, it's totally upto you. It is going to be really difficult to go with 24 hrs in the beginning because it is not as easy as it looks. (4) Not really. However, there are people who chose stoicism as a way of life. I believe this practice is associated to stoic wisdom. (5) You've answered yourself here. Make sure you stay away from computer/phone when you're on detox though. Even the beginner level doesn't allow you to use those during detox. (6) Yeah, that's what the movement is looking forward to. But hey, it is only going to bring more peace if you abstain from distractions more than once a week."

DopamineDetoxing,fp9ku6u,t3_gc2ri9,1588428718.0,"I guess I can relate to you. Only difference is that I dropped out of a professional degree related to finance in the last stage few years ago and chose to become a banker. Fast forward to 2020 April, I've decided to drop my banking career and pursue the final stage of my finance degree because I often feel incomplete without finishing it. Reason for dropping the course is a bit personal and it caused the downward spiral of my life.

Point is I'm also hooked to technology. I believe there are certain strong invisible patterns which are making us hooked to it. After all, all big tech companies have attention engineers who are recruited to research on how best to grab our attention. All they need is our attention and they have us in this short term gratification pleasure trip. Let me remind you, taking the detox isn't easy because I've been trying and failing at it regularly for the last few days. Maybe because I'm a technology junkie. Planning to do a one week hiatus starting from Sunday to give the smartphone a break and reflect on my current lifestyle while starting the necessary routine.

I'm happy you've figured your goals already. I believe in the coming one year, my plan is to pursue this finals and therefore spend a lot of time with a side job and mostly with books. And by the way, I deleted Instagram three months ago and Facebook this week. I'm also kind of hooked to YouTube and whatsapp. 

I don't have all the answers. Just another noob in this world. 28m from India. Let's collect the thoughts next Sunday if you've replied to this thread. I badly want to prove myself right and my life has reached a point I will be most comfortable with strangers in internet with similar goals rather than acquaintances because this is after all cultivation of a mindset.

Looking forward to changing the old patterns to new. All the best fellow redditor/s! :)"
DopamineDetoxing,fp1491s,t3_g8g7hx,1588223980.0,"Hey man, I just watched the first video of this movement in YouTube. Dopamine burst is real, isn't it? I've been in this negative spiral of slacking off by resorting to instant gratification for escaping from facing certain rejections and realities in life and as a result I've always been numbing my pain and seriously recking a good life I've always deserved. I'm all in for this. It's like I've been slacking off on acing an important exam all these years too. I feel like if I can do it, my mental state is going to change and I'm going to feel better.

Anxiety,fny59yc,t3_g4hgcb,1587353746.0,"Hahahaha. Yes. At any given point of time, I have like at least two or three of my worst cringe worthy memories for disposal which involves either people who used to be close to me or places or memories. And the chain reaction of thoughts following it. There's no escape from it. I'm trying to defend it by following two strategies. First is meditation for sure. As hipster as it sounds, I guess it helps in focusing on the present with practice. But it is really difficult for me to meditate on a daily basis because of the ""laziness"". Second is basically a realization that the reason why we're feeling cringe thinking about certain events in past is because we've really matured from the version of us in the past and we're trying to judge our version in the past which is basically a mindfuck for a human being. Because we're never going to be perfect. Chances are our future self is probably going to cringe at some of the actions of our ""present"" self too. Ja feel? Yeah, you're not alone and I'm so grateful to share this."
