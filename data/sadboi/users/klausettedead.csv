I first started getting into it a few years ago, via Tumblr and Instagram and have just started buying pieces because I actually have money and my own space now (and no over-controlling boyfriend!!) and thus can do this now, haha.  

I love Baby the Stars Shine Bright, as well as Angelic Pretty (I know those are probably really basic). I want to find more gothic lolita brands, so if anyone has any recommendations, I'd love to hear them! 

Sadly, there are no stores or cons nearby here usually, but maybe me and some other Florida lolis can get something started! That would be awesome! I think the closest we have, that I know of, to anything lolita is the comic/cosplay/anime conventions we host in Tampa and Orlando that have a few lolita events sometimes (not that it's cosplay).

Pastors: \*Speak hatefully about them in service\*

Those same pastors: wHy ArEn'T tHeY lIsTeNiNg?

I went on a whole rant about this during a car ride to two poor people who had to hear it (I pity anyone who's had to hear my rants), and basically my whole point was that: How do pastors expect gays to want to attend church and become Christians when they're essentially being looked down upon and judged by a whole entire congregation of people? I think I compared it by saying something along the lines of ""Why would a fish want to swim near a group of sharks?"" or something like that. Why would they want to be around us if they're just going to receive hatred and negativity \[that will further push them down a life of sin, due to the hurt\]? 

I know this isn't the case in all churches, but some will show clear judgement written all over their faces, even if they don't say anything, for people engaging in sin, as if they've never sinned before. It really turns people away. I'm not saying to tolerate the sin by any means, but you can still treat them normally without judging them. Sometimes you don't see God working through you. He can work on these peoples' hearts in places you don't even realize He is because He knows them and their hearts, and we don't.

You might not even realize it, but you might say something that hits a vein within in them, that makes them think twice, when you were thinking about something entirely different. You might completely self-unintentionally (spirit-led, God-intentionally, though) that will bring up for them the reason why they're engaging in the sin, or something like that, for example. As long as God is working through you, and you are doing your part as a Christian under God's will, having faith in Him that He can change people, something like this may occur, or however God has intended it.

depressionmemes,fg7czxb,t1_fg5xlcw,1580589538.0,"Omg when I was reading this I was trying to remember if this was something I posted somewhere, because I've been noticing and dealing with the exact same realization with my family. I always felt like something was off/strange (the psychological term would be that the emotional mirroring was off/strange) but it's like I could never prove anything. All I could do was read their emotions to know they were lying directly to me, and confrontation would just leave me feeling more confused because they'd reassure me despite what I could obviously sense. 

I think this can be beneficial for us in life, though, as we will be able to tell when we're being duped; just don't doubt yourself like I did. All it did was prove me right and get me screwed over when I didn't trust that discernment... It's there for a reason, I guess. 

I'd advise you to keep any deep personal matters/hurts away from them, as it will only serve to further traumatize you, if all they want to do is lie to you/give you fake emotional responses. 

I know certain people in my family just simply don't have the emotional capacity due to mental illness, and the thing is THAT'S FINE, JUST BE HONEST ABOUT IT. I wouldn't care if they told me they didn't care; what bothers me is them trying to be fake about it.

The thing is, the people who were your guardians (parents, grandparents, etc.) were controlling your life by getting you to believe that lie and operate on it. If you don't believe, they won't have that control over you. The only person I want to control my life is God and myself at this point, although I would become under a control if I ever get married, which is fine, because if I'm going to marry someone, I'd trust that he'd be fair to me. 

Anyways, the reason they act like this is because they are trying to keep themselves under control, but they don't realize that they aren't actually doing anything to solve their inner problems, and that is the reason they feel out of control to begin with. If they would just work on those, they wouldn't have to be fake. Don't get sucked into the trap; view it as a bad example of how to handle problems and do better for yourself."

One painfully relatable thing here though is: ""I know what I'm doing wrong, but I just can't make myself stop.""

One of the best things you can do is slowly start refusing the impulse. If you even refuse 1/5 impulses a day, AND keep praying, it can get better. Slowly, you'll get to 2/5 impulses refused and so on and so forth. Quitting any addictive behavior cold turkey is difficult, but if you refuse the impulses, that forms those pathways in your brain and it gets easier over time until your brain will learn to take the refusal bridge rather than the giving in to impulses one, if that makes any sense.

1. Calm down; do not be afraid.
2. Prepare yourself, and fight it. Get your crucifix/rosary/religious pieces, holy oil, your holy water (if you don't have any, try to obtain some, or in the very least, pray the prayer over some water, or just read from the Bible), put it on yourself, your chemical burn, the doorposts of your home, pray continually, keeping God updated with what's happening, fighting hand in hand with Him, led by Him. Read from the Bible and rebuke the evil thing. The point here is to establish your territory and body for God, banishing the trespassings of anything evil, in the name of Jesus, and creating a space unwelcoming and uninhabitable for evil. Evil things definitely do not like it when you say ""Jesus"", as they cannot survive in his presence, so please use his name when combating this thing. Do this as long as it takes for it to stop. During this time, ask God to reveal to you what it is that caused this to occur, so you can commit to making sure it doesn't happen again.
3. If it doesn't stop within a couple days, seek out a priest.
4. Now, address any medical concern that may still be persisting. As mentioned in other comments, this may be a mental delusion brought on by an allergic reaction, and if you think that is the case, you definitely need to go back to the doctor."

Some of us are just made to take pain, perhaps."

Christian,feuftou,t3_eqipzs,1579386084.0,"I've read/heard that it's like, the people will inherently kind of choose the path, even though it's never been enunciated to them. It's like choosing a pet bird rather than another pet (NOT to compare religion to pets, okay) or something, but you don't know what they are, really, but you just like them for whatever reason. 

Like, this is kind of how I adapted the theology into my life. I just chose what seemed to be the most good, the inspiration presumably coming from God and other stuff I learned. I thought of Bible verses before I'd ever read them/heard them, so I think ONLY IF God knows you're going to be in a position where His word will not be accessible to you when you need it, and you show a desire for it, whether you understand that or not, He will be there for you and show it to you."
