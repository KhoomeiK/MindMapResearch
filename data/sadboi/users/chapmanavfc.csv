autism,fidy53j,t1_fidxdo8,1582372756.0,I have light blue eyes and in the past few years light has really got to me even in doors sometimes I have to wear glasses but I don’t when I’m in the public eye for example or on FaceTime to a friend or taking photos because I don’t look how I look with them I’m on the way to a football game / soccer if you’re from the us and I love going all my sensory problems go away which is crazy because I hate noises crowds etc but when I’m there it seems fine but it’s Leah might just be a bad day :(

Anxiety,fbf1bbb,t3_ed0zc0,1576799007.0,"Not good at giving advice but, FUCK WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL AND YOU WILL SUCCEED IF YOU WANT TO!"
Anxiety,fbf187f,t3_ed18qu,1576798945.0,I guess it’s a never ending cycle of you both worrying like “will he/she think I’m annoying if I message them now” or “oh he/she is too clingy” or even he’s just scared he might mess things up or he has been with somebody before who didn’t understand him and left him for being the way he is it could be a number of things maybe try mention it to him make him understand you understand :) good luck to you both
Anxiety,fbf0xaf,t3_ed1h6u,1576798726.0,I can’t give much advice next to nothing really but I hope it comforts you that I’m questioning everything just like you like why the fuck am I replying to you why do we understand each other you know good luck man
mentalhealth,fb2yo3w,t3_eb83aw,1576460243.0,Only advice I’ll give you is what I know it’s hard as fuck but if the people you love for and care for don’t show the same respect and love they ain’t the right people to have in your life positive people positive mindset good luck man :)
