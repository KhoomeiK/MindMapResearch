I would say to you that not only has Mike & Page‚Äôs playing improved, the band is altogether more patient and melodic in their jams than ever. There are even more effects at their disposal. The repertoire has practically doubled...

Nothing to prove = purer, more genuine artistic expression (is that a contradicting opinion?! Gasp!)

The old songs performed nowadays? Yeah, flubby and not as cohesive in performance as they once were. They‚Äôre literally not as passionate about the old songs as they were when they came out. Shredding is rarer and not really Trey‚Äôs style anymore. Sometimes it feels to me like he does it as fan service to older fans who don‚Äôt appreciate the new.
