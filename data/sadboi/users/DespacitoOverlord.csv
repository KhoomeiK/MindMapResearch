His 6 million damage is on average. Literally every fucking unit in the entire goddamn game does different damage numbers on different turns, did you just forget what game we're talking about?

He does almost twice as much damage, and only has 30k less average defense than LR Vegito Blue. Not my fault your defense wank makes you think that Vegito Blue is somehow factually better."
DBZDokkanBattle,fp7bu4g,t1_fp7bh3y,1588367691.0,"He only gets hit for 200k on normals if you put him in slot 1 with no items used. That's just a biased scenario.

You're just one of those people who only judges units for their defense alone. Vegito Blue is great, but he's not a defensive god in ESBR.

It's stupid to say that Vegito will just take nothing when he'll still take around 250k on a super compared to Trunks' 300k. However, Trunks will do over twice as much damage.

The strat of focusing on damage in ESBR can be effective as well since the enemies are extremely squishy and don't take many hits to kill. That's why GoFrieza is easily one of the best units for that specific mode."
DBZDokkanBattle,fp7al2a,t1_fp7abep,1588367037.0,"Yes it is, he has a high natural defense stat and stacks with multiple supporting units. His 30% defense raise factors in what his defense originally was at the start of turn, which factors in his supports.

DBZDokkanBattle,fp7a6zv,t1_fp7a0kr,1588366835.0,"Vegito has better defense, but they both need to be covered with items in turn 1 regardless. Trunks also hits over twice as hard when you prioritize Vegito's 12 Ki."

Trunks has less start of turn defense, but his raise on Super calculates differently, meaning the defense support he gets will heavily impact his overall defense.

Combine that with his defense stat of over 14k, and he won't be a liability.

Trunks isn't bad, stop downplaying him."

If you really wanna use a Summonable LR to use as an argument for being worse than Vegito Blue, use Majin Vegeta or INT Gohan. While it's debatable if they're worse, they just flat-out have no defense and do less damage than PHY Trunks."
DBZDokkanBattle,fp78k9o,t1_fp78a99,1588365997.0,My point is that you're judging units solely by how they deal with turn 1 ESBR. Vegito Blue gets killed their as well.

DBZDokkanBattle,fp77ubp,t1_fp77i1m,1588365630.0,"Yes he does lmao, having 120k defense with no reduction ain't gonna cut it in turn 1 ESBR.

If anything, Trunks is better for ESBR because his higher damage makes it more likely for him to kills enemies before they even get the chance to kill him. 

Not only that, but Super PHY is known for being flooded with Defense supports. MVP 17, Gowasu and Zamasu and Great Saiyamen 1 & 2 all help Trunks defensively."

Godku doesn't need to be under 50% HP after 4 turns to be good, and he actually has good links. That's one of the shittiest comparisons I've seen. 

Not only that, but Vegeta would only hit harder if he were given a 24 Ki average, in which he doesn't have one.

Babidi and Dabura have more utility that Vegeta and Nappa. They do more damage, they seal and stun, and they have good links."
