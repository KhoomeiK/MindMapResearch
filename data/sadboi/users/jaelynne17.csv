BPD,fqi8zyi,t3_gj0599,1589392584.0,Unfortunately yes this is a valid reason to fire you as a client in the US. Some psychiatrists aren’t qualified to deal with certain disorders and some just don’t want to deal with those certain disorders and it is 100% their right to choose not to.

This time it’s been completely different, I went from having it the first time with next to no period, to now having it again and having a period every month and blood spotting every week. Couldn’t tell you why, but it is normal for it to go wild. My friend took her arm implant out because she was practically on her period every other week and constantly spotting with nausea like you.

I’d dye my hair (myself) up to three sometimes four times a month, from ages 15-20 (now 21) I’ve had every color you can imagine and I had an issue with cutting it too. Every time I thought it would make me feel better, and every time it made me feel worse and like I was prettier before I did it, even though I did it because I always felt so ugly. It’s definitely an identity “not good enough” issue. It sucks. It’s like you see one women with short pitch black edgy hair and you’re like “YES THAT MUST BE ME” then you do it, copy her hairstyle and a week later see a woman with beautiful long naturally blonde hair and you go “SHIT THATS ME, WHY HAVE I DONE THIS” and you dye it again and get extensions....vicious cycle. I’ve finally laid off with the motivation of wanting long healthy happy hair, thanks to my therapist, my boyfriend and work on myself I’m starting to gain a very small amount of confidence. I still feel ugly AF damn near everyday, but I’ll play with colorful makeup (when I have the energy) instead of ruining my hair.

Try to feel proud of yourself for being able to love so deeply. It really is beautiful thing and someone someday will be so thankful to have a partner like you.

You love the show friends, you love art, your a caring kind person, you’re great, you just can’t see it yet” and honestly I think he’s right.

However,
My boyfriend and I’s communication skills and needs in an argument are completely different. I want to talk, he needs to think. So...we have to talk about those needs. We have to tell each other exactly what the other person wants from us when strong emotion or conflict arises. Or really ever...we have to be EXTREMELY open and honest about everything we feel. 

I am the BPD in my relationship as well. When I’m having a freak out, temper tantrum, spurt of jealousy, crying spell, whatever it may be, I just try calm down for a small enough time to say to my partner “hey, I’m extremely overwhelmed right now and it’s not your fault can you please just hold me for a moment until I calm down”. Or wherever it is you need to say to your partner to let them know you’re having a break down and just need a moment, or to chat, or to be alone or held or whatever is going to help you.
