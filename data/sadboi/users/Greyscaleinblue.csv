It's hard being a jack of all trades, being nearly good at everything I try. Seems counterintuitive, but being good at sp much it's hard to say who I really am. I don't have an identity.

offmychest,etf8ndn,t1_etf5dyz,1562763481.0,"Well I've been in the south pretty much all my life, but I am about to move to a predominantly white area out west so that'll definitely be a change given knowing what I know now. Southern racism is more blatant, as in they believe they are a superior race and they'll let you know it every chance they get. 

Northern racism is worse though; they believe that they ""can't be"" racist because the north won the civil war. They'll say passive aggressive things (like I listed above) and point to their one black friend and say that it's impossible that they can be racist.

That's like saying having a child prevents you from being a child molester.

I'm just going to take it as an educating experience and be extra careful in this america that we live in especially now. Of course you probably know how many cases there are of unarmed black men being pinned and thrown in jail for no reason, so being in a predominantly white space I'm even more scared for my life cause I'll stick out like a sore thumb.

But at the same time I'm actually very excited because there's still that part of me that relates to white people more than I do blacks (in terms of media, music, those things) so there's still this pull inside me that remembers my past but is also aware of my present? I'm also an introvert so we'll see where it all lies. This place I'm moving to has millions of people compared to my small town of 10K so we'll see what's up.

So it can be a scary situation coming from where I've been all of my life, now knowing what I know about race and racism. Throw in that I'm also pinned as a black guy I just have to around people I've been able to relate to from an area of not only race, but geologic region. Southern blacks are different from northern ones, and even some of them think they're better because they come from up north. It's all such a messy system."
offmychest,etf3o1f,t1_eteyl69,1562758957.0,"I don't know why I assume everyone I meet is from america. Need to stop that. I've never been outside the US so all of that is pretty new to me. 

But yeah, here southerners aren't considered a different race. Just lesser especially when being black gets thrown in the mix. There's this misconception (even by some blacks) that racism just happens in the south and it's just not true. 

Hmm, I can't imagine what it's like to be mistaken for a different race. I myself just do my best to generalize the area people come from (saying ""asian"" instead of calling everyone chinese like a lot of people I know) and ask if I don't know.

Either way, I would say just keep correcting people and you have to find comfort in who you are and what defines you as a person. Once you know who that person is, you won't lose your sense of self when you get around people and they won't be able to tell you anything, because at the end of the day you know who you are. Whether that be race related or something else. You'll find people who you can relate to more (in and out of your race) who share your similar struggle.

Hope this is helping!"

So before I went on testosterone, guys were such an enigma to me.

Coming from a perspective of being on testosterone, it's that they're thinking with their dicks. Sex is on their mind 24/7, and you're a girl with tits/booty so that's what they want. And you're a friend, so they feel like they're halfway there. (Just a guess. Not everyone thinks one same way of course)

Me, I wouldn't do this (especially if I was in a monogamous relationship) but my guess is because he's testosterone driven and thinking with his dick and not his mind. He's definitely 100% at fault here, but that's my guess when it comes to reasoning. 

It's not a hit at you specifically. In his mind he's thinking about that one thing he wants, and whoever has that, they're pretty much prey.

I know that sounds horrible but that's my guess. I'm sorry you're having to deal with this :/"

Ah. I was so hesitant to even click on this post because wow, this was me so many years ago. Someone I tried to bury. I'll go ahead and spill my story. Black trans person here, btw.

So I grew up a happy girl. (This isn't my transition story I promise). I went to a private school in NC and all of my classmates were pretty much white, a few sprinkled Mexicans, and maybe two black kids (including me). But I didn't know that then. ""I didn't see color.""
 

I'm an avid (and was) a jonas brothers fanatic. Posters all over my walls at 12 years old. Happy tears streaming down my face when I saw them on tv. One day, I remember flipping through one of those teen mags and pulling out the posters to put them on my wall. My boyfriend at the time asked me about the Chris brown poster I had swiftly passed. I wrinkled my nose.

Bald headed. Big lips. Lanky. 

Why the hell would I want him on my wall? I told my boyfriend he was ugly and didn't bat an eye as I hung a solo joe jonas poster over my head.

In class, I sat behind one of my friends. Her hair was so long and so straight and I could get my fingers through it. I'd look to my own in the mirror and frown. Puffy. Course. ""Nappy"".

I wanted to be like her. The girls the jonas brothers liked looked like her. All of my barbie dolls looked like her. The majority of the girls on America's next top model looked like her. Why didn't I?

Fast forward, high school. High school band. My high school had the same demographics as my middle and elementary schools, but at this point I was still blind to color. I just knew there was a certain type of girl that was more favorable, and that her features never matched what I had.

So I started experimenting. This was around the time that the ""emo rocker"" thing was cool, so here I was. Wearing fingerless gloves, drawing kitty whiskers on my face. It wasn't really me, but I knew the guys I liked seemed to like girls that looked like that. With straight hair of course.

Graduated high school and went to college. Again, predominately white and Christian. Nothing too different, same demographics from before. Found a friend that was similar to me and a lesbian. Again, still pretty much thought we were all the same.

Loans ended up getting out of hand and I transferred colleges. Went to one pretty close to home. Also happened to be an HBCU. For those who don't know, it stands for historically black college or university. Man did my world change. 

I started learning about my heritage, and about the world. About everything that I've been through in my life, small nuances I missed, slick remarks that were attack at my character, and my being.

""Ha! I don't see color.""
""You're not like those other black people.""
""Wow! You speak well! ....For a black person.""
""YOLO! What up fam??"" -white people I'd just met.

I learned about cultural appropriation. I learned more about politics, the workforce, financials, self development, and well being.

And I also hated that school.

I hated how isolated it made me feel. I hate how I felt like my world was turning upside down, and that everything i knew was a lie. What were they saying?

When I got there, I was told I talked white. I talked funny. I was told I was privileged. That I was different. 

I didn't understand. I was just being the girl (person?) That I had been my whole life, but I didn't understand until I read my history and really analyzed what I'd been through how toxic I had been. I realized how beautiful being black was. All while feeling isolated inside the black community.

To this day... I still grapple with it. And adding a mishmosh of gender identity in it has left such a big questionmark on my life.

All my life, essentially I tried to be something I wasn't. No, there isn't one way to be black, but the way I did it, i was trying to change into who i wasn't. I was ashamed of everything I was as I tried to change into what I knew to be beautiful. To be more valued. To feel... ""normal"". To be white.

I never reached that. And my HBCU let me know it. But if they hadn't, I'd still be floating through life believing I was someone that I wasn't. That I should be ashamed of everything I have, of everything I thought I was.

I still feel out of place. In white places, I'm pinned as ""too black, too ghetto."" Or it's the complete opposite, I'm the one good token n word that they needed, all while they defile me to my face.

In black places I'm privileged (which I am). In my small community, I'd be considered wealthy statistically by black standards. (Compared to whites I'd be in a studio apartment at best). I'm still pinned as ""too white"" because I'm obsessed with the jonas brothers and because I like rock music. And because of my NC accent.

I've learned to be myself in all spaces. That yeah, I like fall out boy, all american rejects, and blink 182, but yeah I like erika badu and drake. It's honestly all so much more intricate than this reddit post can hold. 

It starts with reading your heritage, by being alert. By being knowledgeable and willing to learn. 

You are beautiful. You are amazing. OP, you are each and every wonderful adjective describing the beauty that embodies you. You are a black goddess, Itll be amazing when you're able to channel it and see it <3

Tl;DR: find yourself, be proud of who you are, be willing to learn, you're a black goddess"

selfhelp,eoni7aj,t3_bsgj5t,1558713130.0,"You're setting the bar way too high for yourself and expecting too much wt the moment. If you find yourself unable to reach your goals, you're either trying to push too many new tasks at once (making too many new changes) or you're setting unrealistic expectations.

Know that it's not you. It's everyone else who says if you don't meet your goals you're not motivated enough and that's just not true. 

What does work is using small goals and letting those build up, no more than two at a time.

For instance, I'm in the self help game too. My small goal is to write one blog post a week. It's small, and it's a task I know I can definitely meet. My big goal is to earn 100% of my income from blogging, but to get there I know I gave to start on mini goals that add up to the big one. 

Success is consistency, and it starts small. I know humans want everything immediately, but it's better to start small, be consistent, and build rather than to do everything in a day and burn out for the next two weeks.

So if you think your goals are already small now, cut those in half. Do it until it's something you know you'll be able to meet in the interval that you want to meet it. Once you've met that consistently, add a little on to that and meet that goal. 

Hope that helped! And you just gave me my next blog post idea!"
