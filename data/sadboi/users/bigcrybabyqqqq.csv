Parenting,fpj9161,t3_gdrai7,1588660294.0,"My parents were the same way. There’s all sorts of reasons why your dad could be the way he is but ultimately it doesn’t matter. What matters is that he doesn’t realize he is the problem or won’t take responsibility, and you know what maybe he never will my dad sure as hell didn’t. Your mom probably knows deep down that their relationship is toxic, but it’s kind of a sunken cost thing. My mom wanted to leave my dad but didn’t because she would have had nowhere else to go. 

These sorts of domestic situations are really tricky especially with so few details, so trying to give you advice is honestly a bad idea. All I’m gonna say is that it’s important to know the things he does aint your fault it’s on him. It’s easy for the child to start feeling guilt when their parent is always lashing out and pointing the finger at them or at the other parent, but it’s not your responsibility to maintain peace in the household your just a child. Your dad is failing you, not the other way around. I wish someone was around to tell me that when I was a kid.

I used ask myself “why” about a lot of things, but I think as I’ve gotten older I’ve come to realize that knowing the answers to those questions won’t change how I feel or how I feel about my dad. It’s not my job to unpack all his unresolved personal issues for him, and I don’t need to let him live in my head rent free."

I first started mostly drinking water when I was 18 to get in shape, I’m 27 now and water is basically the only thing I drink aside from alcohol. Even when I go out to eat I just drink water, I can’t really stand soda anymore despite loving it for 2 decades. I think it just takes time to get used to the flavorlessness of water, but once you do you start to appreciate it. Mostly the feel/taste of cold water there’s nothing else like it.

But if the blandness of water bothers you that much you should try Bulby water (that is the name of the brand). It is a flavored sparkling water and is imo the best one there is. Many flavored sparkling waters have added sugar and stuff, but not bubly water as far as I know. I drink it a LOT."

raisedbynarcissists,fkjauhb,t1_fkj9qv0,1584240761.0,"Yeah that sounds about right. As an adult I’ve felt like she was never willing to validate my feelings. Whenever I told her that dad was abusive she always tried to play it down. At one point I straight up told her “you are not validating me because you don’t want to admit you made a horrible, life altering mistake it would be too painful for you” 

I’ve always believed that my mom had good intentions, and since she was also a victim of my dad maybe she was as scared of him as I was. But still it’s so hard for me to forgive her especially when she denied it continuously. It wasn’t until she was dying that she half heartedly admitted it. She said she wanted to leave and take me, but she didn’t have any family and didn’t think we could survive alone. Her English used to be very bad when I was a small child. I remember not speaking English to her until I was in like 3rd grade.

Anyway this is something I wish I knew earlier in life: your parents belief of what success is does not have to be your own. For a long time I was convinced going to college, getting a good job, getting married, raising family in 2 story house, and retiring (in that order!) was the only definition of a good life because that’s what I was led to believe. I wanted this so badly and until recently I was very depressed over the fact my life didn’t end up this way. I’m starting to learn that I can find happiness in other ways, I can decide for myself what makes me happy. This is something you can do as well. Don’t let your parents decide who you are going to be as an adult, they did enough deciding for you when you were a child!

I understand how you feel a lot, I sometimes feel that if I’m not doing something productive at all times then I’m being lazy or I’m a loser. But that’s just my dads beliefs that I’ve internalized, it’s not normal to feel that way. It’s important to keep that in mind. It’s ok to just stop sometimes and take time for yourself. I think asian culture is way too work oriented to the point that people literally work themselves to death, this is no way to live that’s not what a “successful” life looks like, at least not to me."
raisedbynarcissists,fdzdb3c,t3_enc3o4,1578789123.0,I’ve just created a fake story I tell people unless I’m really really comfortable with them. Avoids the headache altogether.
raisedbynarcissists,fdzcpmu,t3_enawz1,1578788999.0,"It’s funny how that happens, I’ve been through that too. A male superior at work will compliment my work in anyway or teach me to do something new and my brain automatically goes “father figure” for some reason."
raisedbynarcissists,fdzcgic,t1_fdzc5jg,1578788882.0,I can’t even say I ever spoke to my dad without being spoken to first lol
raisedbynarcissists,fdzce41,t1_fdz1scz,1578788846.0,That’s how I feel. I don’t think it’s just my face I think deep down I am upset I’ve just gotten good at convincing myself nothing is wrong.
raisedbynarcissists,fdy0int,t1_fdx8u9c,1578774766.0,I don’t think I forgave him I just accepted that it happened and that I can’t change that.
raisedbynarcissists,fdwtz0j,t1_fduen6k,1578762319.0,"Yea I feel like I have the same facial expression no matter how I’m feeling, but my logic was “I shouldn’t have to explain to anyone how I feel, if they actually want to know they’ll ask” but I dunno maybe I should just make it clear how I feel."
raisedbynarcissists,fdwt74s,t1_fduqfkn,1578762094.0,Yeah I definitely have SOME habits of his. Like the way he naturally talks sounds really angry and defensive even when he’s just talking about some normal thing. When I’m talking to people I’ve often gotten a response of “why are you so angry?” or “calm down” when I wasn’t even mad it’s just how I talk!
raisedbynarcissists,fdwqybr,t1_fdv2rf7,1578761458.0,"Hmm...yeah I didn’t think about that. If I know anything about that man it’s that he would never think he did anything wrong I think if he were me in this situation he would have found some reason to yell at my son.

Ha I remember one time when I was talking to my mom my dad came into the room and I just froze and stopped talking reflexively cause I was always too afraid to talk normally in front of him. His response is to go “why did you stop talking?! Am I a criminal or something?! I’m not a criminal, keep talking!” Like he’s self aware enough to realize he’s the reason I stopped talking but he found a way to make *me* feel guilty about it???"
raisedbynarcissists,fdwpt3k,t1_fdv4bi8,1578761216.0,"I honestly don’t know I think I just look sad/upset most of the time which Tbf I am sad most of the time so. People who don’t know me very well tend to be put off by how I look it seems I don’t look very approachable, which again tbf I don’t want people approaching me so I guess I really am unapproachable.

So sometimes I think it’s not just my face it’s just how I really feel.

Now that I think about it though, my friends in high school always said I had a huge vein popping out of my forehead, I’ve never seen it though."
raisedbynarcissists,fdwocmg,t1_fdvphw8,1578760810.0,I didn’t want kids either for the same reason but life had other plans for me I guess lol.
AsianParentStories,fdwo53n,t3_cv056q,1578760744.0,Yes you are being abused
AsianParentStories,fdwnpkp,t3_edmvfw,1578760587.0,Yes my dad is so mentally ill but will never get help for it he had terrible OCD. I don’t even know if he knows he has it or knows what it is. I’ve realized most older asian people either don’t believe in psychology/mental illness or they’ve never even heard of it in the first place.
Parenting,fdpjlfv,t1_fdp68mp,1578630393.0,Same here
