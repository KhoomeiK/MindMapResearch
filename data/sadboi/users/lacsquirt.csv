**Misfit Mischief Game Pack Concept Information**

(Many of the ideas were inspired by [Sacrificial](https://sacrificialmods.com/) and Reddit users u/adamleg and u/isbobdylansingle under a comment of a post I saw and previous sims games)

Features

* Burglar/Robber Career
* Gangs such as in the sims 3 university where there were jocks, nerds, and rebels (this could even be included in the social groups section)
* Stealing from people
* Potential to get caught and fined by police
* Calling the police on people and having other sims call the police on you
* Burglar alarms
* Baking ‚Äúspecial‚Äù snacks like ‚Äúpuff brownies‚Äù which will give you the dazed effect
* Teens could get in fights at school
* Graffiti
* Arson (starting fires)
* Burglar outfit
* More  punk style outfits

Why I believe this has the potential to be a good pack

* Some people may find some of this content triggering so having it separate from base game will give people the freedom to choose
* Adds more drama to the sims
* Something more players tend to be interested in

Custom Content Recognition

I'm a 17 year old girl and I've also been in similar situations as you have. I'm 5'1 and 263 lbs which is due to genetics and just unhealthy life style choices. I hated myself for so long. I've been working to lose weight by exercising and controlling portion size for months but only went down 10 lbs. I've also been in other similar situations that you mentioned such as my father leaving out on my family at a young age. Life is definitely hard. I understand that, but if you're trying your best or even just trying, try to not be so hard on yourself. Easier said than done, I know. But when you have those mean thoughts just say ""shut up"" and ""you're lying"". Just keep it up and soon enough it'll be a habit and you won't think as negative as before. You got this in the bag!

If it's causing you too much stress, maybe take some distance from your bestfriend so feelings may subside. Feelings may never go away and that's okay too.

Losing someone you love hurts. However, let's talk about you and your feelings.

Your feelings of wanting to die because of your own suffering is valid. I feel that almost everyday, but just because suicide seems like the right idea, doesn't mean that it is. If your life is at rockbottom, the only real way is up from there. There are ways to make your life better. There are ways to get help.

On ways that you can help him, reassure him that you are there for him and that you're willing to listen to him and help him. Sometimes people just need to vent about what's troubling them and so if he isn't having a good day, a simple ""Is there anything that I can do to help you at this moment?"" Random messages such as ""Hey. How have you been doing?"" can even help sometimes when someone is feeling down because it seems like someone actually cares. If things get too out of control, ask him about seeking professional help. If my suggestions didn't help, try seeking professional advice as well.

I am hoping things get better for you and for your friend."

There was this one guy I never even knew that killed himself when I was a freshman in highschool. I still think about him. His friends still mourn his death and celebrate his birthday for him.
