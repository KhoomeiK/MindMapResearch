You also could call the coppers to let them know, have a chat with them and you might be very surprised what they will do, these are strange times and they are doing what they can to help"

Secondly, leave her and distance yourself. If her feelings for you are not strong enough to stop her sleeping with another person then you deserve better.. It does not matter if it was after an argument or you split up. 
You need to ask yourself how she can just turn off her emotions for you like that. But then again, she is not worth your time. Look after yourself."

She had invited me to stay, I said no. 
As much as I would love to be with my son, I feel it is better to avoid confusion, confrontation and what would result in a toxic situation. 

I think for containment purposes it would be ideal to have everyone inside together with no outside exposure. But this is down to your personal situation/relationship with your child's other parent.

Perhaps you should weigh up the risk factors and discuss as co parents what is best/safest for you child.

I am in Ireland in post containment containment - delay phase."

Once you do this you could try putting yourself first, maybe start with an std test!

Best of luck!"
