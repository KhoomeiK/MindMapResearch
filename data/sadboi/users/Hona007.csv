AskReddit,fqb6z2p,t1_fqb56kv,1589231670.0,"For everyone. Who wants to read me disproving him.

So I always wanted to prove an anti vaxxer wrong.
So here is my explanation on how they work.

So your immune system.
Has a great defensive feature.
And that is memory.
Since I assume you're dumb.

Its like soldiers fighting someone off.
And then learning their weakness or the best strategy on how to defeat them.
And then if they attack again it will be easy to defend.
(This is very simplified)

So what a vaccine does.
Is inject a dead/weakened type of a virus let's say measles.
And make it a kind of a threat so the immune system will say.
This is kinda dangerous produce the memory cells.
And then they fight it off.
But they always win because its weakened/dead. (Except when you're immuno compromised)

And if you don't get the vaccine the actual measles (stronger than the vaccine one).
Your immune system will be tired or you will be dead.

But if your immune system is tired/weakened.
It can't fight any other threats.
So its kind of a lose situation.


That's how they work.

And before you start shouting aluminum and other dangerous chemicals.

Do you know table salt?
Not dangerous is it?
Well it consists of two main ingredients which I can't remember.
But the ingredients by themselves are very dangerous.
But together they make harmless table salt.

So two chemical substances together make a different property that can be very different to what it was separately.

I dealt with my cousin who lives in Germany and was born there.
We were talking bout stuff.
Then it came to beliefs turns out he was an avid christian.
He believed every conspiracy under the sun.
He would reject any science and say ""god"".
And then quote the bible.

Also so many religions claim they're the "" only one that is true"".
