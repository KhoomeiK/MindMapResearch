Bernedoodles,fr1kgas,t1_fqy0jrf,1589821273.0,"Go get her, seriously. The transportation companies all suck. If I would have known what I do now, I would have made the 24 round trip trek myself. Hound Haulers is what I'm using and the communication has been piss poor. They told me ny dog would be here Monday and its now going to be Wednesday...he was picked up SATURDAY. It is only a 10 hour drive one way but they try to fit in as many pick up and drops off that they can so that continues to delay everything"

I hesr they can be stubborn and in these days of quarentine and social distancing I'm hoping to spend more time training him since puppy school doesn't look like an option at the moment.

While it is tragic ~22+ people have died, I'm sure some sustainably educated and conscious, animals cannot do anything but live in the mess us humans make for them. Animals then have for run for their lives when it all crumbles because humans in leadership don't take the science seriously. I will always care more for animals than humans."
