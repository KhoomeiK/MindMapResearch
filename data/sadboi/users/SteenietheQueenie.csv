For me, I didn’t really know I could have ADD. I just thought I wasn’t trying hard enough in school, but eventually no matter how hard I tried, I wasn’t getting any better. Also, the majority of the people in my family who have ADD are men, so I also thought that women weren’t susceptible to it. But when I talked about some of the issues I had growing up over time (not just as an adult), it started to make sense.

And also maybe talk with your doctor about why you think you might have it and mention that you really don’t want to get diagnosed just to get drugs, but you really want help in figuring out if you have ADD and how to manage it."
