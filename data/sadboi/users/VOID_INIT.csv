MAC addresses are useful to gain access to networks where the mac address is used to authenticate the user. But thats pretty much it.

En annen ting er at ordet ""sekvens"" ikke er helt korrekt 친 bruke i tilfellet her. 

En sekvens er et gjentatt m칮nster. 

En rekkef칮lge er et m칮nster som har en fast orden.

Sekvens = (123, 321, 123, 321, 123, 321, -> ...)

Rekkef칮lge = (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, ... -> 칀)

Basically what I am saying is that order (rekkef칮lge) is a more correct word to use than sequence (sekvens).

So if we start with the English sentence:

In Norwegian it becomes:

But honestly there are a lot of great people, who wants to help newcomers out there. The problem arises when newbies thinks that everything can be done in a day, they do zero research beforehand and/or straight out asks for help doing malicious or illegal things.

A lot of people who knows a lot regarding these types of things usually have it as a day job, and it quickly gets annoying when you see people trying to abuse and destroy the work others have done.

In this example, him asking for help isnt a problem. The problem was that he did basically zero research beforehand and what he wanted to do was both illegal and malicious. We dont want to help someone who tries to hurt someones income just because they want to look cool or gain an unfair advantage over other players.

All in all, if you do some research beforehand, ask nicely and tries do something out of curiosity and it isnt malicious, then people have no problems with helping.

Encouragement. Dont focus on the bad sides of things when trying to help someone with an addiction. That will just make them feel attacked. Focus on the positive things. Make them feel like you are rooting for them to succeed at becoming a better version of themselves. 

In the case of someone being overweight, this can be for example you saying, ""you look great today, have you lost weight?"" To someone you know is trying to be more healthy.

Or if you can say: ""Hey did you know that by only walking one hour each day and cutting out sugar from your diet you can prolong your life by 10 - 15 years!? How cool is that!""

- Unless the connection is ptp (direct connection between you and the other person) then you will only get the IP to, lets say tiktok's server. For example you cant really track anyones IP on reddit, because you are connected to the server and not the other person.

The ***correct*** way to do this, is very simple. If anyone does anything illegal online and you have evidence, take screenshots and record video and then send it to the police.
They are actually in power to do anything about it. They will gather evidence and make a case which can be used to prosecute. By trying to do anything yourself you can quickly end up hurting innocent people, doing illegal actions yourself, and you destroy information which could have helped the case.

To even store the information they need to follow very strict rules. What happens if this info gets leaked and 50% of you have typed in your passwords/bank details/other sensitive information? I dont know where you live but this should be reported wherever you can. 

Hell, my brothers school got recently in major trouble because they posted pictures of students without asking the parents for permission. This is a 100 times worse.

The fact that they are recording you and can do it without you knowing is also a very serious breach of your right to privacy. A lot of private stuff happens in a home and in front of a computer. Lets say your father is talking to your mother about economy and they share banking details. The school now have details which can be used to steal money and your personal identity.

If you can't get the student association to do anything, report it to a newspaper. They will have an amazing day having something to write about, and this is definitely easy to make a news article about.

hacking,fm4uq09,t1_fm4s3mc,1585761166.0,"Physical != Local

Physical means you have to be sitting in front of the machine. Local means you have to have access to a part of it, for example a user.

A virus could easily use this exploit to gain access to everything. For example use it to hold its files for ransom, like ransomware does."
cybersecurity,flveqbk,t3_frahrg,1585522263.0,"Most of these sites are invite only. Which means it doesn't even need to be a part of the deep web. It can be a normal server which is protected and only people who are given access are able to connect.

Governments usually try to raid the servers physical locations. Some even have ""honeypots"", where they allow illegal acticitys to a degree to gather evidence. They do it this way, because people often use some type of encryption in addition to connecting from public networks. This makes it difficult to use server logs to find criminals and it is difficult to use in a court. Instead they often use ""undercover"" officers to operate the servers and ""lure"" out the criminals. For example get them to install malware on their personal systems. In other words, it is very difficult to intercept cyber criminals selling stolen data. However it is also difficult for criminals to find out where to buy and sell data. It is all a lot more complicated than most people think. 

If I were you though, I would not focus on this. I would instead try to learn programming/development/etc as this will help you more in the long term. You will learn everything you need to know through courses in college and training when you later get work. 

Also most people working with cyber security for companies, dont worry about things like where stolen data is sold, because at that point it is already too late. Cyber security is about how you can mitigate the risk AND the consquenses of a breach. It is not a question of if, but when. For example you want to store hashed passwords instead of password in plaintext. Not because it is less likely you will be attacked. But because, if you are attacked, there are less they can do with the data they steal. 

Btw, you should learn how to google these things. If something is not on google, then people in this sub would probably not share it with you either. 

I also want to add that cyber security is nothing like what they show in shows or the news. It can be super interesting, and also super tiring. Many times you have to sit hours reading long complicated texts, to learn theories about security principles and best practices. However, cyber security is a never ending field which can be extremely satisfying and there is always something new to learn. If you enjoy learning then you are going into the correct field.

Good luck with everything!"

MechanicalKeyboards,fl2o94r,t1_fl2m0wl,1584755766.0,"I use colemak normally but sometimes have to use qwerty when helping out friends or whatever. I type on average 60-70 wpm with colemak. My qwerty on the other hand is pure hunting, but I type about 45-50 wpm xD On this specific minimal layout, i am still getting used to it, but I type about 55 wpm, but thats expected when changing over to something new, and especially a 35% when you are not used to it.

What I have learned is that you will use your own stuff 99% of the time. The rest of the time it will be a lot of random stuff. The way I see it, it is better to use what you want and find comfortable and worry about that 1% only when you have to.

The question is really: Do you want to be as comfortable as possible 99% of the time, or just somewhat comfortable 100% of the time. Another point of switching to colemak/dvorak/workmam/etc.. is that it forces you to relearn typing. You can easily rid yourself of bad typing habits.

What you get back might or might not be a lot, but thats up for everyone themselves to decide.

Instead of asking people why they switched, you should ask why they stayed.

In my case it is because I felt a noticible difference. I feel like there is less strain put on my hands/wrists.

You shouldn't switch for the typing speed. If speed is what you want then you should learn to use a steno. You should switch for all the other benefits you get. If you dont feel like the extra benefits are worth it, then dont do it :)"

There are 4 layers and each brass layer is 3mm and each wood layer is 6.5mm. (two of each) I must warn you though, that is barely enough space for everything inside :)
I use 20mm screws, but thinking of changing to 22mm as the screws are only screwed into the brass itself and isnt secured i to anything else :)

Changing to colemak takes some time, and it will take a few months to get back to somewhat normal speed. BUT the reason you change is not for the typing speed and more because of the health benefits. With colemak you stay more on the homerow than qwerty, which means less strain on your hands and wrists. 

This might not be noticible now, but can save you in the future.

Another positive thing is that it is the perfect time to try out new layouts as well, maybe even a dactyl or just going for some more simple slit ergonomical keyboards.

But it is a difficult decision. You will have to relearn typing. 
Is it worth doing that, for the health benefits you get? If not then dont do it.

If you however want to do the dive, then you are more than welcome in the community :) Check out r/colemak"
