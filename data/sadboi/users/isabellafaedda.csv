depression,fblz9no,t3_edpkii,1576974178.0,I feel the same and it’s hard because I don’t even know how to explain this and I feel like shit
ValenciaCollege,f6qwa9w,t3_dra80h,1573087561.0,Thanks for this review! I’m considering attending Valencia and this is really helpful to know more about the teachers there :)
depression,exv9ngf,t1_extekw7,1566595265.0,I hate when someone tells me I need to sleep more (shit I sleep 12 hours a day) or to have healthy habits like going to gym. Of course I know  I need all of this shit but I JUST CAN’T and people don’t get that.
depression,exv9gp8,t1_extjr9t,1566595154.0,"yessss. I’m always tired and I sleep like 12 hours a day. It must be some organic shit from depression, idk."
depression,exv914v,t3_cml6ni,1566594900.0,You know when everything is just so messed up and you can’t even describe how your life’s been or how you feel? I’m so tired. I feel this giant emptiness inside and I carry so much guilty with me. I try not to judge myself but it’s just so hard.

Outlander,ex7yx69,t3_crowvb,1566066582.0,I absolutely love LJG ❤️
Outlander,ex4436l,t3_cre57y,1565997931.0,I’m also confused about that. The only thing I know is that he didn’t want to give up on being a Fraser.
Outlander,ex43yo7,t1_ex3xk14,1565997839.0,I live in Rio de Janeiro! Are you in any Outlander facebook groups?
GilmoreGirls,ex3wppf,t1_ex1y9zz,1565993180.0,"Yeah, I feel that too. One thing that has always bothered me about her is that she sees herself as a saint who shouldn’t suffer the consequences of her stupid choices (like losing her virginity to a married man and then trying to justify it to Lorelai). She has great qualities but thinks she’s better than everybody because of them."
GilmoreGirls,ex3tmxz,t3_crc6tl,1565991338.0,yesssss!! it’s so cringy!!
Outlander,ex1bdxx,t1_ewrz843,1565937878.0,I’m surprised he would do that. That’s very sweet of him.
Outlander,ex1b6uu,t1_ex16cq5,1565937649.0,same here
Outlander,ex11tzy,t1_ew66yxh,1565928092.0,YES!!!!!! You just said everything I wanted to say. So good to see other brazilian fans here :)
JaneTheVirginCW,ex0zajc,t3_cqyemf,1565926053.0,I feel the EXACTLY same way.
GilmoreGirls,ex0z4vc,t3_cr00wb,1565925928.0,"The revival has some great points - seeing Rory and her ex boyfriends grown up as adults, finally seeing Emily and Lorelai giving a chance to therapy, seeing how Rory deals with her conflicts as an adult, seeing Luke and Lorelai FINALLY getting married. But it also has so much that makes me still mad after 3 years - the hole Rory pregnancy and who is the father thing, the fact that she actually agreed to be Logan’s affair, the still lack of comunication between EVERYONE, Sookie being away for almost 2 years (I think)... It all makes me not wanting to watch it, so I only watch it because I’m a perfectionist and want to finish watching everything."
Outlander,ex0ykja,t3_cqzml5,1565925502.0,"I feel the same way. I also have depression and tend to become obsessed with things that give me the opportunity to scape my reality for a while. Just be careful to not forgetting basic self care (at least that what happens to me when I see myself in these situations, idk)"
Outlander,ewx9zps,t3_copeyw,1565850046.0,"I don’t hate Frank. At all. Obviously, the Jamie x Claire relationship is what made me love the show, but that doesn’t mean Frank is the worst or anything like that. I feel really sorry for him because he had the most difficult life. He married Claire, got sent to war, spent 5 years not seeing her and when they finally got to be together, she disappeared. When she came back, they had this awful marriage and wouldn’t even share a bed. The only good thing we see happening to him was raising Brianna as his daughter. But even with all of this, I don’t blame Claire either. She offered him the divorce and told him she would never keep Bree away from him, but he >chose< to stay with her, even if unhappy.  Claire fought her feelings for Jamie, but she fell in love. She’s not a monster. After she came back, she accepted all of his conditions, but she could never stop loving Jamie. It was beyond her power. And she’s not a monster for that."
