lonely,fce9en3,t3_eh3ruu,1577618258.0,"Yes, this describes me quite well. I've pined for friendships etc for a long time but not been able to make lasting connections with people. As a result, I turned to internet, alcohol, and other distractions that are less painful than the loneliness. Since I started trying to kick those habits and solve my disconnection I feel hollowed out just as you describe. I've also found it difficult to find a therapist that understands what I'm saying. I haven't found solutions as such but I've found a few things to be helpful: 

* being honest to myself about my feelings
* being open to receive other people's connection as and when it comes along
* allowing my attention to focus on the issue. This is not the same thing as ruminating, which is running problems through your head constantly, but it's about considering the question ""How do I conceptualise this situation and what can I do to solve this? Am I sure I've got that right?"" and letting the solutions make themselves apparent as you live your life. The reason is that if you have ideas (whether they're yours or someone's put them there) that don't map to reality, you'll miss opportunities to pursue the things you want.

None of these things are easy. Actually I find them really difficult and time-consuming. Not sure if any of this makes sense but I hope it's helpful."
