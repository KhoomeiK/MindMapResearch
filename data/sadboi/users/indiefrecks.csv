BPD,fnacwge,t3_g0jg6x,1586795285.0,Yes!!! I can smoke weed and be completely fine but alcohol fucks me up completely for a day or two after. 😩
BPDmemes,fn51byp,t3_fzjj75,1586653599.0,Ahhh ffs
BPDmemes,fmb26ot,t1_fm6wnlt,1585916220.0,"Borderline female here, I’ve never actually met a borderline guy irl. I think if two borderlines were to date, one would have to be more dismissive for sure. I know from my experience I show my symptoms as “quiet” bpd. So I think if I met someone with bpd that I liked, I think it would work. I think it just depends on the people."
BPDmemes,fm3nxiw,t1_fls5qq5,1585730401.0,Same 🤟🏻
EDanonymemes,flnah73,t3_fpthjq,1585313951.0,Yup a few smokes a day keeps the appetite away
BPDmemes,fll5ki4,t3_fp8mrc,1585254032.0,Telling myself to “go with the vibe” yet acting opposite to feelings. RAD.
TrollCoping,fll5fmh,t3_fp7keo,1585253961.0,I really resonate with this. I don’t care about me. I only care about the people around me and spreading the virus around. I know way to many people who wouldn’t be able to handle it.
TrollCoping,fjoslp1,t3_fazb56,1583534011.0,Loooool
BPDmemes,f8br0cn,t3_dtnngh,1574443325.0,My BPD insta is @bpdstamina or instagram.com/bpdstamina ☺️
BPDmemes,f0yqjnw,t3_d74lm4,1569075711.0,I had a relationship with someone just because I was lonely. After a few months I was looking for an out when he came to me and told me he was gay. Safe to say that’s done now 😅
ptsd,f0vco6j,t3_d6nj9p,1568976455.0,SO true. Ive had symptoms of mental illness since I was 10. I never told anyone about my childhood trauma till I was 19. They told me to get over it. Ive been dealing with the consequences of keeping it bottled up all these years ever since (and I’m 22).
BPD,f0vcijd,t1_f0slckb,1568976248.0,You’re totally right. Thank you for the insight ☺️
BPD,f0vch63,t1_f0ssjl1,1568976198.0,Yeah I guess I found out the hard way that not everything is the same. Like I mean I felt like everything was good. So this just shattered that you know? I should just mind my own business from now on but its hard when its about someone you love 😞
BPD,ez95kh7,t3_d06vri,1567773643.0,"Personally my anger is internalized and most people see me as “bubbly” until I’m not. Pretending everything is fine is easier than feeling any emotion other than happy. It takes a lot for me to snap in anger. Usually when I snap its when I’m overwhelmed and I just cry whether I’m in public or not it doesn’t matter. Not sure about you but my psychiatrist used my self harm as a huge indicator. Ive been self harming for 12 years. (Im 22). I was only diagnosed because I had an emergency hospital visit when I had a suicide attempt last year. 
My doctor tells me that its common for BPD patients to do things impulsively out of anger such as punch holes in walls or throw things. Whereas I would self harm as part of my anger. Im not a quiet borderline though, my symptoms are visible because I don’t bother to hide them. You and I sound similar though. Im diagnosed BPD, major depression and PTSD. Some find comfort in the label and diagnosis. I don’t. For a while my doctor said it was schizoaffective disorder because of my hallucinations. Sometimes my psychosis episodes can be really bad but those are stressed induced so my psych says. Also, I wasn’t properly diagnosed for a long time and I still wonder if its schizoaffective disorder. Im easily triggered and borderlines shouldn’t have hallucinations as bad as mine and manic episodes so often but thats just my opinion. My doctor is a FIRM believer in BPD though so lol. Guess Ill listen to him. He doesn’t want to put me on antipsychotics either because of how “ugly” they are of drugs. So im on zoloft and topamax and self medicating with weed and occasionally benzos when needed. Idk if any of this was helpful lol. Anyways. :)"
BPDmemes,ey9dbuo,t3_cw85u3,1566940731.0,Lol this beats my bio.
