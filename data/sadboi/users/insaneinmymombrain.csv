 She's British though, right? She grew up in England.  English actors are very popular in the US. Online it says she was born in Japan, but it looks like she did not go to school there.

I also have thought that perhaps the director and writers want her to behave this way. I just watched the scene where her and Katie are sitting at forrest's dining room table.  They're just sitting there talking. Katie's reactions are not overly animated or emotional, but she seemed so much more natural. Lily's character seemed strange, or off. I know I harp about it, but her accent is so strange it distracts me from what she is saying. I have never watched her in anything else, so I don't know if she's a bad actress, or if she's supposed to acting this way because Lily is a simulation or something..."
