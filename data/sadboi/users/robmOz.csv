Meditation,fql797m,t1_fqk2bdm,1589448718.0,Have you tried using an app? I think an app which explains the basics and allows you to keep track of your practice helps. I also have my own meditation calendar which I made up on the wall of my study where I meditate. This consists of a grid like a calendar allowing me to briefly write how I feel after each session. When I look at the calendar on the wall I can see all of those positive experiences. ps I have OCD as well.
Meditation,fqcr7yn,t1_fqcfwna,1589266299.0,"Agree. 1) How the app tracks my practice encourages me to keep to a routine. 2) Puddicomb's lessons Basics 1–3 and Pro level 1 – 3 bring a knowledge and experience that would be hard to match. 

I have been repeating each individual series from Basics to Pro about 5 times before going on to the next one. Doing this for about 2 years. Tried one or two of the other packs but so far haven't gotten much out of them. Saying that, the basics and Pro are so good I don't mind paying for a yearly subscription because of how it's made such a difference in my life."
Meditation,foewvo7,t1_foad0ag,1587717615.0,Interesting. I have been meditating daily for about 15-20 minutes for about 1.5 yrs and found a big difference after about a year.
LogitechG,fmo40dm,t3_ekka17,1586244566.0,I had my account stored in a password manager so I know I definitely had a log in. My account disappeared as well. Created a new account with same email address and old products appeared!
OCD,fdqc1rk,t3_emirc3,1578662573.0,"Can relate.

I have religious scrupulously OCD... jump between thinking things related to the existence of God. e.g. ""God exists"", ""God doesn't exist"", ""I think I'll stop being a Christian"", ""I don't want to be a Christian"", ""what if I stop being a Christian ?"", ""I feel better now... I think I AM a Christian"", ""oh right I have OCD... this is a loop that I've played before""... 

It's like a never ending series of unanswerable questions. The only solution is to somehow get out of the ""matrix"" altogether. I've found that mindfulness meditation hekps. I can sometimes slow thoughts down enough to be conscious of them originating and view them like a bystander and visually place them in a sort of ""OCD zone"" in my mind. Doesn't bring 24hr relief but gives me a nice break once a day."
antidepressants,fcu0217,t3_dtumhg,1577967762.0,Just curious- how's it going? Any improvement?
raspberry_pi,fcoo4fk,t1_fcnpqez,1577837122.0,Maybe test with another device to isolate problem away from the Pi first? Maybe even a mobile phone?
raspberry_pi,fc8dbya,t1_fc812vp,1577532353.0,"Hmm ok. Thanks for the reply.

Probably also depends on the workload? I watched this video https://youtu.be/tWsM69_5g4E

Would be interesting to see how long a pi in a case takes to throttle when running the stress test. The unit he had with heatsinks lasted 2 minutes which I thought wasn't too bad."
raspberry_pi,fc7och7,t3_egkgvz,1577514224.0,Do you really need the CPU cooler? Could you run your current system without it?
DataHoarder,f9jab4p,t1_f9g5anc,1575363698.0,"Ok. Sorry I read your original post incorrectly. Somehow I saw 2 2TB drives!!  One question. Consider Idle power draw of the NUC vs NAS? –> would the cost savings of not getting the NAS eventually be spent in extra electricity costs of the NUC? 

Also, it seems that another big difference between the two setups is that the multiple 2TB drives don't seem to be online all the time (backup only) while the NAS solution would make them available? If you don't need the data on them available immediately then maybe the NUC solution could work?"
DataHoarder,f9fvzc6,t3_e4sbvg,1575287039.0,That's a big jump from the 2 2TB external drives mentioned in your NUC solution to the 2 10TB drives in the NAS? How much data do you need to backup?
usenet,f77fxkq,t1_f76rhj5,1573454888.0,"Thanks. Maybe we are talking about different scores? With the  score I was talking about, an indexer which has content that you download that others don't have would get a higher score and if both indexers have the same file they would get the same score irrespective of which one you used to get the download location from?

Re the concatenated names. Weird. Viewing your post using the Reddit is fun app on Android shows named on a separate line while on the Official Reddit app all names are on the same line?

usenet,f76oxq5,t3_dujbnq,1573432010.0,"Ok I'm new to Usenet but interested. Why do you say that the scores aren't meaningful? I've had a look at the source code for hydra2 on GitHub and, at least at first glance, the scores should be useful? i.e. scores reflect downloaded files and the indexers which contained (referenced) those files vs those that didn't have them?

Also, why have you concatenated the name of your indexers? :-)"
usenet,f6lehux,t1_f6lcp8c,1572940591.0,Thanks for that. It's all clear now. :-)
usenet,f6lcgq7,t3_djfchz,1572937662.0,"Thanks for the great post!

Is Usenet-server the same as [www.usenetserver.com](https://www.usenetserver.com)?

Shouldn't it be ""UsenetServer""?

usenet,f6lc6xm,t1_f45v5o6,1572937279.0,If you are on a desktop I think the existing layout is the way to go?
Meditation,f5w3der,t3_dmie0i,1572512737.0,This might be discouraging but I found that it took about a year of meditating daily for 10 or so minutes before I really started to notice important changes. So my advice would be to not expect anything but look at it like you're practicing a skill. Reprogramming is occurring in the brain but it will take time.
synology,f49jlk5,t1_f49ao6l,1571469576.0,I don't have a NAS but am considering getting one. Just thinking. Wouldn't the first step before upgrading ram be to run some sort of system monitor to see what the ram usage is first?
Christianity,f40ele4,t1_f404h6g,1571296326.0,"What about the fact that it says ""evening"" and ""morning"" for each day? Sounds pretty literal to me?"
depression,f0vjfe5,t1_f0m8q8c,1568983613.0,Thank you for your answer. Such good advice. I find if I look around there is often someone worse off than myself. Spending time helping people is much better than trying to match high achievers who don't have depression etc.
Christian,ezisykf,t1_eyx7lof,1567932749.0,Why do you think Adam was lonely in the garden of Eden?
Christian,ezispru,t1_ezfutzt,1567932634.0,Great question. I really feel this thread if you know what I mean?
antidepressants,ey4tm7b,t3_b0w0nv,1566807396.0,I take Luvox and have found that my desire for coffee and alcohol have gone down considerably. Have you googled Luvox and caffeine interaction?
antidepressants,exbbyn6,t3_cqkdtt,1566127800.0,I have a friend who it seemed to work for. He was suicidal and antidepressants didn't work. Although he now takes antidepressants he is no longer suicidal and seems to be quite happy.
antidepressants,exbbh9a,t3_crc0rx,1566127495.0,"I've been on it for 19 years. Helps my insomnia, depression, anxiety, and OCD. I have also found mindfulness meditation very useful."
antidepressants,ewo6cvc,t3_cnzzom,1565607799.0,I've been on fluvoxamine for 20 years. I would love to one day get off it. One thing that has helped me a lot lately is mindfulness meditation. I'm not sure if I will ever get off the meds but if I ever do i think meditation will be a big part of it. Have you ever tried meditating? I can relate to your description of uncontrollable anger and how you are able to identify that it is your brain thinking things that you wouldn't normally do. Meditation should help you catch these unhealthy thoughts quicker before they take control. In theory! :-)
Christian,ev96ev2,t3_ca3fz8,1564308612.0,"I can relate to your post so much I thought I should reply. I have OCD myself and have been on medication for 20 years. Things might not necessarily get easier but to have a chance you need to look after yourself emotionally, physically, and spiritually and keep things in balance. Find a good doctor, try psychologists, maybe go on medication. Keep physically fit and maybe join a gym? The mind and body are connected. OCD will try to pull all these things out of balance and when that happens your thoughts will be out of balance. Having doubts can be a symptom of faulty thinking as well as a spiritual issue. Don't give up."
Christian,ev95xlt,t1_ev7d491,1564307854.0,I would imagine if someone is a Christian it's going to be pretty hard to keep that to yourself?
Christian,eupwxsb,t3_cfv99q,1563966100.0,Have you been diagnosed with OCD and anxiety by a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist?
Christianity,eupvgb8,t3_cadtf1,1563965167.0,I am comparing Olive Tree and YouVersion at the moment and find that while I really like the YouVersion interface and social  integration Olive tree seems much better for Bible study.
depression,euewtgn,t1_eudpp6a,1563756150.0,Lots of people get into engineering because they don't have people skills I think. Do you have any hobbies? I've recently joined a woodworking club and have found the social contact positive while not overwhelming. You can focus on making things rather than worry about what others think of you for example.
depression,eud87an,t1_euboxnz,1563706830.0,My depression started around 2000. It's refreshing to hear from someone who has had it for a similar length of time.
depression,ettb04v,t1_etqmbmy,1563171279.0,Sorry to hear about your parents. A relative who is loved and who has passed away is a great loss. Ok. Yeah I might have overreacted a bit? I just think that you have to be very careful when talking about cures for depression. Sometimes people with be on medication long term and with that comes side effects. My experience is that you never really feel like the same person you were before you started using meds. It's like learning to experience and manage life again in a completely different way.
antidepressants,ettagvy,t1_etoiwbq,1563170632.0,"Ok. You probably already know this but I'll say it anyway. You know that the symptoms you describe are actually used to prescribe antidepressants don't you? So a psychiatrist would look at your symptoms and say, ""right, let's start you on an antidepressant and see how you go""."
antidepressants,eto32f0,t3_cckhcl,1563011043.0,Absolutely this is normal. Antidepressants generally dull mood both in a positive and negative direction. Magnitude of highs are reduced and lows are increased. It's always a balance between positive effects and unwanted side effects.
antidepressants,eto2xcs,t1_etnk7jy,1563010861.0,Thanks for the reply. Are you currently taking any psychoactive medication?
depression,etngdms,t1_etms3tp,1562986400.0,"Terrible advice here. If someone ever says to you something like""just kick the depression and try harder and you'll get better"" you know they don't have any experience with real depression."
antidepressants,etnfwtx,t3_cc5kj3,1562985996.0,Have you been to a psychologist? My understanding is that psychiatrists generally are very keen to medicate while psychologist or even counsellors are often better. The brain is complex and while chemicals can help our environment can effect our mood and experience as well. Finding a good psychologist can help you generate some strategies for doing some positive things even when you don't feel like it.
antidepressants,etlh4e6,t1_etl4g1e,1562936242.0,Fluvoxamine is also used for OCD.
antidepressants,etf6pcb,t3_bylcuf,1562761829.0,Probably all psychoactive medication involves a balance between positive effects and unwanted side effects. I don't see how stopping taking medication or lowering a dose is going to be useful if your symptoms return? Perhaps slower thinking is not that bad if you don't have migraine headaches anymore?
antidepressants,etf5lte,t3_bz6oz2,1562760849.0,I think one of the problems is that there are fewer distractions and things to do at night. I have found having interesting movies ready to watch at night helpful. Try to plan ahead and be ready before your mood drops.
OCD,etbkl5m,t1_esmmesq,1562650085.0,"I'm curious about what happened when you tried medication? I'm taking Luvox (fluvoxamine mealate) for OCD, depression,  and anxiety and find that it helps. Without it I wouldn't sleep enough to get anywhere with my mindfulness meditation which helps a lot. What meds did you try?"
OCD,et5zsxl,t1_et3k9v2,1562498935.0,No worries. I've also got depression and anxiety (comorbidity is pretty common I understand). I know that things will go up and down as they always have in the past but it's nice to be able to recognise a positive once in a while. Off topic but I love this sub and it is so helpful to find other people in the same situation.
OCD,esqw9mg,t1_eshw3ii,1562211157.0,Thanks. Ok. Hmm that's interesting and the opposite of what I experience. If I don't take it I wake up in the middle of the night with racing thoughts.
OCD,es5re4i,t3_bq69ec,1561624380.0,Ok I'm a little confused. Are you saying when you take Luvox you get insomnia and wake early but when you don't take it you don't wake early?
OCD,erzgv2m,t3_bq69ec,1561435471.0,Is fluvox fluvoxamine?
exchristian,eru3not,t1_ert9qga,1561261994.0,Thanks for the reference. Very interesting. Saved and will follow up.  🙂
exchristian,eru2zvm,t1_ersl8wu,1561261352.0,My understanding of the argument against this is that Adam and Eve had free will. I'm not saying that what you are saying is wrong but just pointing out that this could be a biblical counter?
antidepressants,errqdg6,t1_erpiuiy,1561179197.0,Ok thanks. From my knowledge of antidepressants this indicates a different issue and possibly completely different root cause to what I have. Thanks for the response.
antidepressants,erp9vum,t1_ere2me0,1561107069.0,Just curious. Is your insomnia problem early morning waking? Or is it being able to get to sleep in the first place? I have OCD and have found Luvox (fluvoxamine mealate) is the only thing that helps the early morning waking.
antidepressants,erp9r00,t1_ere60d9,1561106860.0,Thanks for your post I could relate to it. I have had OCD for pretty much my entire life. I am now 50 and have been taking Luvox for the last 20 years. I was really addicted to masturbation up until about 30 but especially as a teenager so could definitely relate to the nofap reference as well. OCD does seem to fry your braon from overload resulting in memory loss. I try to stay positive and focus on the fact that the brain does have the ability to change and recover.
Christian,erbfx2p,t1_er8bv8i,1560677834.0,"Yeah I think you are right. Distinguishing depression by ""severity"" isn't very useful.  I should have said ""symptoms"".

I agree that telling people they have no hope of a cure isn't a good idea. 🤔"
Christian,er7h1hv,t1_er1227t,1560577650.0,Thanks for your reply. 🙂 The issue of how many people are able to stop taking antidepressants is a very interesting one. My understanding is that there are different types of depression. Some are more serious and involve severe insomnia and early morning waking. If you have this type then basically no matter how much you try you won't be able to get enough sleep. I am glad and thank God that the antidepressants help me to function.
Christian,er7co8m,t1_er4houj,1560574481.0,"Hmm I don't think this is a good sign. 

I think you need to find other men that are more open and committed and not afraid to discuss sex? 

It's not easy to navigate what you are feeling without some reference points and people to compare yourself with.

Maybe look for a men's group/course/camp which aims teaching biblical principles of manhood and sexuality?"
Christian,er47ymy,t3_c0e649,1560483446.0,"How about just asking people ""if you were to die tonight do you think that you would go to heaven?"" Getting those first few words out that is the most difficult part. You can't control what sort of a reaction you're going to get no matter what you say."
Christian,er47eet,t3_c029fi,1560482991.0,Do you go to a church group where sexual issues are discussed much? Sexual topics are often hidden which makes their emotional attachments stronger. It is only through talking with others that you will know that you aren't alone. Well done as reddit is a great start!
Christian,er3hz57,t1_eqyq1ch,1560463656.0,I agree that faith is important. Pray for healing completely but also pray that God's will will be done. Recognise that God suffered on earth. Jesus was disappointed and lonely. The apostles and disciples also went through many things they wish they didn't.
Christian,eqynkl7,t1_eqvj0uv,1560386276.0,Terrible advice. Have more faith! Are you kidding? I suggest you tell that to people with amputated limbs and see if they reappear.
Christian,eqyn2mb,t1_eq6abws,1560386042.0,Indeed. In my experience people with mental health issues rarely get over them. It's a long term struggle which will probably last a lifetime. Far better to learn to live in a balanced way without hitting highs and lows. Antidepressants help to balance things out.
Christian,eqqjtu6,t1_eqn7u2m,1560222938.0,God will sometimes give us what we want and sometimes He won't. It takes faith to believe that He will give us what we want and also faith to trust him when he doesn't. He says we should ask him for whatever we want. No matter what happens he loves us. Sometimes we may feel this more than at other times. Imagine being in heaven where we will feel his love all the time!
Christian,eqn0o1l,t1_eqjlqn0,1560170153.0,What about God's will?
Christian,eqn0dfv,t1_eqjjc1q,1560170044.0,Very bad advice. How do you know God is using this illness to show something that would be impossible without it
