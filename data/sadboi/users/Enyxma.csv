needadvice,fr5l40h,t3_gmdibg,1589910336.0,"Regret and guilt are things you should never be ashamed of, it's proof that you've grown as a person. I used to be really harsh and rude to people, I've lashed out and done things I'm not proud of either. Whenever I felt that guilt or sadness, I used to do everything to keep my mind of it, but then I realised I just made it worse for myself by running from it. What happened in the past stays in the past. You can only learn from it and accept the feelings that come with it and make it better in the future. What really helps me is to not run away from my own thoughts, I close my eyes and I let all my memories and emotions flow and accept how it played out. Questions like 'What could I have done differently' or 'Why did I say/do those things' are really important because it's proof that you are trying to be a better person. Your past will always be a part of you, you shouldn't run away from it or hide it, you should accept it and learn from it. Nothing can change your past but only you can change your own future."

I never reply right away, and sometimes it'll take days to come up with a response because 9 out of 10 times I don't know what to say. And in those days I'll make myself crazy with with my own thoughts like:  I'm taking way to long, people don't care what I have to say or that people hate me because I didn't respond on time... 
I hate that I'm this way, and all these negative thoughts cause me to shut down even more so, now people think I'm just somebody that likes to ghost people, but in reality I just can't handle the pressure of keeping up with conversations."

AskReddit,fj1zy9n,t3_farlmn,1582931518.0,"When I was a kid I used to listen to an pop group called 'toy box' which made music for children. I used to sing their songs at home or at school because I loved it so much, especially a song called 'super duper man' because it was catchy and I liked superheroes. Now years later I listened to it again and now I regret singing this song in public when I was younger. Here's some of the lyrics:

Superman is on the air
I'm flying in my super red underwear
His sexy dress is turning me on
I feel kinda hot when I'm puttin' it on

And my personal favourite:

I can see my house from here
Yeah,
Let's party hardy over there
Can I touch your tingeling
You make superman go superswing

Needless to say, I will never sing this song again"
