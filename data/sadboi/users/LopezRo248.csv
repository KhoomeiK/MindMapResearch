Now, I have to disagree respectfully with you on that last one. Maybe he isn't outright killing someone, but everything he has done is a complete disregard to the law. It doesn't have to be illegal to be a disregard. For example, he wasted everyone's time in court. This is why I believe he did it on purpose. He knew that if Hansen (the real deal) went, he'd be rotting in jail right now, so he wasted everyone's time by probably googling some other Hansen's address and sending him the papers.
