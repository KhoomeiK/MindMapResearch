But I am eating and drinking just fine now.

My delusions were way worse than my hallucinations. I had only 1 second hallucination of objects and animals and humans."

And yes, I have been close enough to them where I can make out a nose, a brow arc and lips and a jaw. Also the middle one is my main one (he is also the only one with hair. I touched his hair once sneakily when I was little because he wouldn't let me touch it when he was holding me and it was soft. It is also glowing, almost cascading like a river of pink lights). He is also the gentle one. The right one is female and she is also motherly and gentle, but firm. The other white one is male, but he is really serious and firm and maybe a little bit harsh, not harsh, harsh, but less gentle than the other ones."
Psychic,f3zhhmq,t1_f3zfzd7,1571269160.0,"Maybe. I lost many friends because they weren't friends to begin with. I am also picky about love because I want a person who will build me up, not bring me down. And I can identify manipulators pretty quick."

Psychic,f3zf0gp,t1_f3zehte,1571268053.0,"Thank you for that hopeful reply. I am going to see my therapist tomorrow and see if I need to go inpatient for depression. Actually my depression is existential and I had several homicidal and suicidal thoughts, but I don't act on them, because, 1, I could go to jail and be there and waste most of my life there, and , 2, if I committed suicide, I would hurt my friends, my family, and whomever else I care about. I also wouldn't be able to draw or write or get a job and grow as a person. May I send you a message so I can explain my entire situation if I get the chance?"
Psychic,f3zeebu,t1_f3ze1ne,1571267718.0,"That's cool. I also see other peoples guides, but they usually look like normal people to me, but sometimes, I see out of the ordinary ones. I walked once in a grocery store and I saw this happy-looking girl who has a bright blue, pink, and violet aura who had unusual guides, but they had their backs turned to me, so I could only see that they were wearing white cloaks. And all I remember was that they liked that this girl was happy. I had a feeling that the girl was happy all the time. And some people are blessed with happiness, and others have to work towards happiness like me."
