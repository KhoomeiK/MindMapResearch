prepping,fq5wg82,t3_ggxk5c,1589119235.0,"Please make sure that when you add daily workouts that you are switching up muscle groups you are working on if you go heavy. Start low and slow. Allow your body to adjust to the increases you put on it. It takes months for muscle, bone, joints, and nerve innervations to increase to the loads you put on them. There are tons of resources available online. Just keep trying them till you find what a right for you. Too much is not good and will lead to injury. Injury leads to setbacks. Do not be afraid to increase your loads, just go slow. 

Best of luck."
