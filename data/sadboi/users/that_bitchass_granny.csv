chromeos,fqc7ov7,t3_ghdvu9,1589251856.0,"to be quite honest, that's just a \~quirky chrome feature\~ as far as i'm concerned. chrome likes to do stupid shit like this all the time to me, and usually if its fixed with just a restart there isn't  really an official problem behind it, it's just one of those things that chrome does just because. kind of like if you have one joint in your body that always pops but it doesn't hurt or cause problems or anything so you just leave it. it's possible it could be a problem with one of your extensions but i'm thinking not as it's not a consistent problem, however disabling your extensions temporarily to check it out won't hurt."

genderqueer,fpm2231,t3_ge3pih,1588723968.0,"you might find genderfluid a more comfortable term. some days you feel masculine, some days you feel feminine, and some days you feel neither of those! you don’t have to stick to one thing, just do whatever makes you feel most comfortable that day. i wake up some days and i hate my body and put on multiple sports bras and a baggy sweatshirt because i feel like my boobs (albeit small to begin with) shouldn’t be there and i want them gone, and some days i wake up and i see my feminine body and want to embrace it and wear tight things and dresses, and some days i don’t really feel either i just stick to my usual jeans and a t-shirt look. i personally identify as genderqueer because any specifically gendered pronouns make me feel personally uncomfortable and i feel uncomfortable identifying with any gender although i do often express a quite gendered look. you are always queer enough to be queer, bi enough to be bi, pan enough to be pan, trans enough to be trans, etc. what really matters is not how you label yourself and how you think you fit with that label, or how other people may perceive how you want to be, it’s how you feel about yourself and making yourself comfortable. you don’t have to pick a label if you don’t want to. just always try to make yourself as comfortable with your body as you can and remember that although in no way is “gay (or any part of the lgbt community) a phase”, how you feel may change over time and as you learn new things and that is perfectly okay. i hope you stay as comfy as possible :)"

AskWomen,fop791v,t3_g8d3f2,1587954647.0,"We were the ""special allergy kids"" that sat at the special table in elementary school, so we were bound to become friends. He was also in my class and I developed a massive crush on him basically as soon as I first saw him. We stayed close friends through elementary and middle school, and my huge crush still remained. We were in the same base friend group, and started to become closer friends around the middle of 7th grade when our friend group begun to dissolve due to drama and the like. During this time and through the beginning of high school, I never dated, never had any crush confessions, never heard any gossip about someone crushing on me, never had anyone seem remotely interested in me, I never even had someone fake confess to me to embarrass me. I guess I just wasn't popular enough for anyone to really care that much about me; either that or people were just plain scared of me (I'm really loud and quite brash and don't really give a fuck about social status or what the hell other people are doing, I just kind of vibe in my own little corner and for some reason that intimidates/ed teen boys???) (screams ""i'M nOt LIkE ThE otHeR GiRlS!!1!1!!"" but I swear I don't market myself like that). 

Fast forward to the middle of freshman year and my (now best) friends and I are just vibing and having a solid time being friends. We texted basically every single day and would eat lunch together, we would often have text conversations going well into the wee hours of the morning that would leave us both zombies at school the next day, we supported each other and worked through problems together and always seemed to be there for each other. At this point, we're the best of friends and told each other everything, crushes included. I never told him that I had a crush on him actively when he would ask or we would be talking about crushes, but I did tell him that I had previously had a crush on him in like the third grade. I always thought I was super obvious around him as I got really nervous and was really giggly, but apparently not because no one seemed to pick up on it until I told them. I thought my long time crush was just going to be a thing forever and that I would never tell him, so I kind of repressed it and allowed myself to have different, smaller crushes on other people as well, 

I had found the r/crushes subreddit and joined and made a post about another one of my at the time crushes because I needed advice on how to talk to him because he was a grade above me. My friend and I follow and know each others reddits, so he found the subreddit through me and posted something about one of his crushes. I said hey fuck it and posted something about him there (it wasn't direct but it was clear enough to get the point across) in hopes it could be an indirect way to confess. Not long after, he posted something else to the subreddit. This time, I could tell it was about me and my first reaction was ""holy fucking shit he's just fucking with me that's what boys do that can't be sincere"", so I posted another thing about him to test the waters. Sure enough, he posts something else and it seemed to still be directed at me. This little dance continued for around a month, me posting something about him and him posting something about me. One day we were texting and I realized I had reached 1k karma here on reddit and texted him about my mini accomplishment. He told me he was going to go upvote all of my posts in celebration. Shortly after he texted me saying something to the extent of ""someone's crushing hard"" and I was like maybe?? maybe not?? and he called my ass out and said maybe my ass you sure do have a big crush. So I again decided ""fuck it"" and said yep its you and as it turns out, he did in fact have a reciprocating crush on me too. He said he had had a crush on me since 7th grade when we started becoming better friends, and I could not fucking tell. 

Moral of the story, my good friend who I had a crush on since elementary school liked me back and we're happy and chilling now."

genderqueer,fneob4a,t3_g0xzl1,1586892923.0," i was born female but am genderqueer/non-binary, so while they/them is preferable, it doesn't really bother me if people call me she still. being young, not married, and still not out out to most people yet also means i still occasionally use the term girlfriend to describe myself in relation to my boyfriend because i find a lot of gender neutral terms either cumbersome or too official sounding. as i'm not out to a lot of people yet, i am still she in professional settings and with people i'm not close with, but they in more personal settings. i'm still she to my family as well, but i'm thinking about coming out after corona is settled down, i just need to be sure of what i'm doing. correcting people in a non personal setting is kind of awkward anyway and i'm pretty easy going, so i guess i wouldn't really mind if someone called me he either. some days i feel a lot more uncomfortable with she than others, most of the time it doesn't really bother me but some days i feel really dysphoric and upset with my body and don't want to be called she at all, but since it my birth gender and legal gender there's not much i can do about it. my birth name is natalie but i go by nat to most people as it is more neutral and i'm not at the point where i want to change my name entirely. nat is also a natural nickname for natalie so people have been calling me it for ages anyway and it is easier to ask people to call me nat than it would be to ask them to call me an entirely different name. being called by natalie instead of nat makes me more dysphoric/uncomfortable than being called she instead of they does, and i find it is easier to ask people to call me nat than to change pronouns because it sounds more like just a preferred nickname rather than a 'gender change'."

ADHD,fiyq1m9,t1_fiyoj7e,1582844407.0,is there a chance that you starting taking a different manufacturers version of adderall (such as generic vs name brand) around the time your symptoms started? its possible you were having a legit allergic reaction to something in one pill vs the other. i'm also thinking that possibly your body started to have bad wearing off/sort of extremely quick withdrawal reactions because that timeline basically fits when mine starts to wear off. did/have you ever taken more shortly before you think the symptoms would start and seeing if they still happen?

ADHD,fiyomqb,t3_fa4r1q,1582843560.0,"you don't have to stay on meds if they don't work for you, they don't usually have withdrawal or tapering down either. try to ask them if maybe you can try for a month and see if it helps, you don't need to stay on them if nothing happens."
ADHD,fiyod2z,t3_fa5d3e,1582843404.0,"of course you are going to change a bit on meds. your brain can finally function like an average brain and do shit instead of be in panic but distract mode all the time. the science behind it is if it works (you feel better when you take them and don't when you don't take them) then you take them because that's data proof that the meds have a positive effect on you. even if you were no not have adhd but this shit helped you greatly, it still helps you and it doesn't matter what name you classify it as. nothing is the same for you as it is for anyone else, so your boyfriend really has no way to tell what you feel or if its good for you. if you start to get side effects from them that are bad yes stop them, but it sounds like that's not a problem. yes you should also eat healthy/exercise, but that ain't gonna fix shit except just make you a more healthy human. we should all eat well and keep up our health. my boyfriend wasn't allowed to try meds for his adhd until his mom had exhausted every other possible fix under the sun, and surprise surprise, none of it worked. it ultimately just set him back and made him frustrated when he could have been so much better so much faster if he would have had meds earlier.   think about this; if someone has diabetes you don't tell them to just eat better and nothing else, you have them check their blood sugar and take insulin. yes eating healthily may solve a little bit of the problem but its still not going to solve the underlying lack of insulin production."

ADHD,fiykizt,t3_faimrh,1582841190.0,"probably mammalian diving response, the same thing happens if you splash cold water on yourself. its leftover evolutionary traits from when humans used to dive a lot, it slows down the heart rate and pulls heat away from the limbs to ""save you"" so you don't freeze and consequently calms you down. it is kind of a hack, i go outside or in a cold place whenever i'm feeling stressed or overwhelmed and it helps so fucking much."
ADHD,fiyk7i2,t3_fahbef,1582841004.0,"therapy doesn't really do much for me to help adhd, it more helps me work through other shit going on. mindfulness (the therapy kind) kind of resonates as bullshit in my head as well (it has too much of an '\~iNsPIrAtiOnAl QuOTe QuiRKy LoL\~' vibe for me). the lone wolf lifestyle seems to help me more than therapy, i kind of just imagine myself as a fuckin kickass person that's living with the world against them but they can do it because they are fucking vengeful as hell, kind of like how intense and semi angry music makes you feel. i kind of practice janky mindfulness, i just remember i'm just another bundle of cells on a fucking spinning rock in the middle of fucking nowhere and try to ground myself that way, and try to remember that sometimes my brain fucks up and that's okay as long as i'm doing my best because there is literally something wrong with my brain making it fuck up like someone that lost a thumb wouldn't be able to grab an average cup like the average person and that just because i know how to do something and think i should be able to do it doesn't mean i realistically can. are you on medication for anxiety? that may be a good thing to look in to as it may help you get over the initial hump of felling like 'i'm a fucking failure'. i recently read the art of cleanliness by marie kondo, and it kind of resonates for me in describing how to tackle adhd in a way. you just have to fucking go, and once you go you won't be able to stop until you are done, as in once you finally find the right shit to help you you want to fucking go as soon as possible and harness that and not wallow in the fact that you feel like a failure. how is your physical space around you and your life in general aside from this? if everything else is chaos you may have to start by organizing everything else before your brain can allow it to organize itself. you're not a bad patient (you can't be one), your therapist probably just isn't a good match for you."
ADHD,fiyi7tb,t3_fah4xh,1582839904.0,"concerta never did shit for me except royally fuck up my appetite (its been like just shy of a year since i stopped taking it and its still fucked)(i cant gain weight and i feel like i'm about 10 pounds under my healthiest weight), adderall actually helps me focus and doesn't suppress my appetite as much but i find if i take it and don't act on my focus as soon as it kicks in it won't really feel like it helps at all (it does still keep me a little bit more calm though which is nice). i am currently on 20xr and it usually lasts about 6 hours before i can feel it wearing off, and it wears off really quickly in me. i can just feel my brain activate fussy toddler mode and decide not to so shit and just take a nap. i have no clue if i experience any physical side effects like you do such as cold hands and feet or rashes, as i have shitty circulation that runs in my family and seasonal allergies to literally everything that make me already have both of those things. do you have any underlying anxiety disorder or a possibility of one? i have one and i can totally see how adderall would make that so much fucking worse. i think i've avoided that probably because i'm also on escitalopram/lexapro for anxiety, so if you have anxiety or think you may independent of adhd/meds that may be something you want to talk to a doctor about. would your symptoms from adderall start really quickly/near when you noticed your meds kicked in and start to slightly taper off as the day went on/they wore off or or did they appear independent of anything else? i'm thinking maybe you may have been getting too much at one time being as you were on immediate release, and that possibly an xr would work. make sure you eat and drink enough on concerta, you might have to have someone remind you to eat enough because after like a week on it i had absolutely zero appetite. good luck finding something that works for you:)"
