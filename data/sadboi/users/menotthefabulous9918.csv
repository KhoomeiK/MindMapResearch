By the way, I do have a few more things regarding Smith housing that I hope to hear your opinion about them:

- Do you think living in a house with lifts is an important thing? I do see that several houses do not have lifts and Idk how much matters when it comes to, for instance, moving in and out?

- Is it easy to change to another house if I’m not happy with the house I’ve been assigned to?

A rule (or trick? I’m not so sure) to draw it is that if it is an anion, add electrons to the more electronegative atom. SO4 2- has a charge of -2. Since O is more electronegative than S, you add 2 electrons to 2 O atoms, each O atom will have one additional electron. Each of these O atoms will have 7 electrons in a way, that’s why they form single bonds with S. Conversely, if you draw a cation, you remove electrons according to the charge borne by the ion from the less electronegative atom (usually the central atom)."
