She developed a rare eye cancer and it spread rapidly and she was dead within a year. It was years before I met him but he was devastated still because he loved her but he also loved his new wife which was why it was so horrible when she ended up being diagnosed with cervical cancer. At the time there was an employee there causing major problems and harassing other coworkers including me to the point where I felt unsafe walking to the parking garage alone after work. Anyway ignore the rambling the point was this fucking asshole employee decides one day to start screaming at my boss telling him he's a cocksucker and he hopes his new wife ""has her cunt fall off and fucking dies too"". I've never seen my boss lose his composure except at that moment, he yelled something back I can't remember and got security to escort the man from the premises.
