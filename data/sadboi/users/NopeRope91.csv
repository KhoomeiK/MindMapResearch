I don't take this as an example of why x can't be done, though. It can be, and the artists are more than skilled enough to execute. You can't just change the skin, you need to change the shading to match the skin. That's not impossible and I don't get why people act like it is. 

There's also many suits that don't look good on default skin (as I often see people point out especially with pale clothes or things with lots of lace), but still the suits are literally designed on that and folks eat it up and wear it anyway. So why can't there be an accompanying dst or two, at a minimum, to go with literally any suit? :/"

HappyPlanners,fp8dp5f,t3_gbqtfg,1588389713.0,"Trust me when I say the peach is hated! People had been complaining that the insides of the planners weren't neutral enough. But that round of planners was also not well-liked. It's like they tried to tone down all the insides and it was just...ugly.

IMO the mid-year planners look much, much better! There are more planners that are closer to the neutral people dream of, with very little color and lots of black and white. And the colorful ones definitely look better.

Personally, the Planner Girl release is almost always my favorite. I got Glam Girl, which has a pastel color scheme and tons of fitting accents. If I didn't have that, I would have gotten the planner with the rainbow cover (it says ""get busy babe"" on the front), because that one is actually FULL of the color and designs that HP got popular on and that I would expect from them.

Sometimes I'm afraid that HP will become boring, and start looking like them office store planners we hated/were bored with. I love HP for their fun designs. Seeing people complain that they want something ""adult"" and less colorful reminds me of how kikki K. went - they used to have more fun designs and colors, too, but if you look now everything is plain and neutrals and nothing that made me feel the magic I did when I bought my first one in 2015. If I wanted a plain planner I would literally buy an At-A-Glance and call it a day lmao."

I use the darker skin tones periodically, just depends on what makeup I wanna use. You will see me in WR 99% of the time, and you will see me make a sad face every time there's a debut suit that still only comes in default, or they release makeup recolors (that only come in -some- colors, not *all*). 

I love my skin, and I love showing that off in dress up. Increasingly, suits that don't come with darker skin tone poses are basically worthless to me (so many of them just look so BASIC unposed and not worth the diamonds/money)."

I've been stressed about federal aid coming through, and not exactly processing other people's reactions to being stuck in the house very well.

I actually want to get back to work! Just...when it's actually safe to do so.

IMO, I don't know what is going to be different for y'all rn because every time this happens, people get heated for a second and then forget when LN brings out a welfare event/something for free/new feature/etc. You'll have to do something different and I really think that means having an organized effort at being vocal directly to LN -- and making it a lasting one. 

Personally, I don't even have a problem with the pacing of events and that seems to be the case for a lot of people outside this sub. For my play style, because I drag out my crafting and evolving and all that, more events is better. It's nice to get a couple pieces, hoard my diamonds because nothing comes in a DST, and keep it moving. The collabs are a little different; I do think they should be better spaced since they don't return. But aside from Barbie, I've been able to pretty much skip em all since again -- no DST. It's actually making saving diamonds *so* easy. 

I also think a part of me, a dumb and naive part of me, hopes we get fully caught up to CN ASAP in the hopes of the devs having more room to make new shit that's more inclusive. 

sooo tl;dr -- I understand the frustration, but don't feel the same and also have my own frustrations that have turned me rather ambivalent to both this game and any efforts to get ""organized."""

Regardless, we who want better from LN are expected to shoulder quite a bit - we have to keep speaking up, keep dealing with those trying to talk over us, and now also decide whether we will allow ourselves to enjoy the things we asked for. Whatever choice we make, if we'll recharge or not, is gonna be based on the fear that we might not get anything else. It's an unfair situation no matter how you slice it. 

This post casts blame on a part of the userbase that was always gonna be at a disadvantage no matter what...thanks to LN. LN can do a lot better and I think people should keep speaking on it.

I wish cute stuff like this would be more common in the west. When was the last time we had a pink nintendo console??"
LoveNikki,fg0idn6,t1_ffzhdti,1580408414.0,"That wasn't the only argument, no. Even I would point out that redoing old makeups would be a huge task and unlikely but I wouldn't sit and argue about it every time somebody brought it up. Anyway the grievance for me was that there had to be so much arguments in the first place, which did nothing to encourage me to stick around in the game and much less in the community. :/"

ACPocketCamp,ffz5tlk,t3_evjcr8,1580364944.0,"I'm gonna wild out for all that Reese stuff OMG. I should have known I was gonna be in trouble, February always brings the cutest stuff!!"
LoveNikki,ffz36um,t3_evo7vc,1580362459.0,"Ngl my interest in playing this game dropped severely recently and lack of options for DST was a big part of that. It gives me some hope to see that they can, in fact, bring us existing makeups in the skintones (and hopefully poses too at some point, but if only new things come that's cool too and no I'm not complaining or demanding more more more). Especially glad to see this after so many wanted to argue about how implausible it would be... 

Finallyyyy I can do something with hacker's secret skin, which is one of my favorites!"
ACPocketCamp,ffh2ytm,t3_eth3xe,1579921700.0,"Lol I always have cute characters, can't seem to part with a couple of them as they're my faves. But I cannot stand the sporty types. Always talking about sweat and gym bags. No thanks, ugh.  I also really need to start inviting harmonious/civic/etc but those ones are tolerable."
ACPocketCamp,ffh282p,t3_et69e3,1579921136.0,I'm just gonna grind for a bunch of the lil ones because eff that. I'm thinking it'll be good since I have like zero good tables to work with :/
LoveNikki,ffh0rji,t3_ese5ue,1579920030.0,"Lately I don't even log in until late at night and I'm hitting all the buttons because I can hardly keep my eyes open! I'm just in a period of not really caring...on one hand I'd love to be done with this game and delete it, it'd free up like 4gbs of space on my phone. But I haven't reached that point yet. Most of the stuff coming out just doesn't excite me. It's still not super inclusive for the dark skin tones, and I guess my attention is just elsewhere (hello pocket camp). I guess I miss fully enjoying games, every aspect, and not having those feelings that I as a consumer don't quite matter, or that the game is really just an annoying chore or habit that I'm not able to quit. -shrug-"

ACPocketCamp,ff93p60,t3_esc6rw,1579704085.0,I caught a super huge koi but still no string fish lol
LoveNikki,fdztxld,t1_fdyr7ui,1578795709.0,This. This right here.
Anxiety,fdzs2ej,t1_fde4978,1578794461.0,"Definitely relate to the disappointment aspect. Really sucks. Fear was a big point in my therapy sessions, too."
Anxiety,fdzrklj,t1_fdeduwt,1578794143.0,"I've only had the customer service jobs and they are brutal for me. I've never made it to a full year at one myself. Writing is super cool; don't give up! It's not really writing, but if you're good at editing I know something you could try (not sure if we're allowed to suggest stuff here)."
