So many people I pushed away if they got to close, damn. I've tried some antidepressants but I'm not sure if they help with traumatic experiences. I hope things will get better, but I not sure I can wait that long."

Such a beautiful comment, thank you for taking the time. My mum did name me after the poet and I did also write poetry myself, before my mental illnesses took over my life.

The pain of my life feels like a dragon that, instead of conquering, I spent staring into its eyes. Knowing exactly what's wrong with me, but not having the strength to overcome, creates a pain to it that's utterly unique and excruciating. I just wish I was stronger than the demons standing before me."
depression_help,fpns1ce,t3_gdzwys,1588771334.0,"You're a good person but it seems not particularly assertive of your real feelings, desires or dreams. I've gone through similar and see a lot of myself in you. 

You need to put yourself number 1 in getting help for yourself, this might be really hard for you because you care about other so much. But trust me, if you keep giving and never ask of take sometimes you're going to become used up and well - tired.

I realise it's not much, but I hope this helps"
depression,fpnpkkh,t3_ged86x,1588769710.0,"ha, I didn't celebrate my birthday this year, but happy birthday! I'm a bit older than you but I did exactly what you said you did. 

Try to treat each week as a completely new one, also you might want to tell people it's your birthday before it comes up, most people don't keep in their conscious minds details of other people's lives like that ^^'. Don't take it to heart but do try to make yourself known a bit more."
