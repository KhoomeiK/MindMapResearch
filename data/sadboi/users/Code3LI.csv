My income: $53kish. I work for the county and will be getting a 4.5% raise in July. My side business of personal training was supplementing my income but is dead now due to the virus. I have the benefits and I get a pension (3% goes in automatically).


Her income: $31kish. She is currently going to a local school for medical billing and coding while working full time with special needs kids. I kind of had to push her to realize we needed more income and that her current job didn't have much, if any, room for growth. Hoping for a decent raise when she gets a new job after graduation in a couple of weeks!


In savings: $53k. My parents said they'll also give us $20k. For closing I believe my union has benefits for legal situations. I don't want to use it all, as I want an emergency fund as well. As for now, the $53k is in a HYSA."

Maybe try sitting down again and tell him there's no shame in having depression and that you want him to be happy.


You can also ask in r/depression.


Also, ketamine treatment is a new treatment for depression. You can check out r/therapeuticketamine for guidance there. Spravato is the drug used by many, which is a nasal inhaler taken under the observation and guidance of a physician. I currently do that, and you need to be on an antidepressant to be on Spravato therapy. Others use ketamine via IV, which is also done (I believe) under the care of a physician. This generally isn't covered under insurance, whereas Spravato is generally covered by insurance. 


If you need him to talk to someone about it, I'm a 31 year old male that has had depression and anxiety for years. I've tried many medications and therapies. I've even tried supplements and chiropractics. While it stinks, my life was much worse without help.


Last but not least, depression can be a symptom of low testosterone, medically known as hypogonadism. He should get a check up and have his levels tested. Check out r/testosterone for more information there. People on Testosterone Replacement Therapy (AKA TRT) seek to get normal levels of testosterone via injections, pellets, creams, etc. These people, such as myself, are NOT seeking ultra high levels like some bodybuilders you may see (although TRT will help build muscle since he may have inadequate levels at this point in time).

Yeah, on personal finance they stick to that rule of 3x your income, but I figured that couldn't be done everywhere, especially in HCOL states/areas.


Now it's just a waiting game to see what my wife's new job will bring in :). Otherwise for now I may stop saving and help her pay down debt, as the only debt I have is my car which has an interest rate of 2.99%."
financialindependence,fo1h17g,t1_fo1gik2,1587433110.0,"I did learn this from a good friend... He was actually my best man. He got a good paying job through his wife's mother. He started splurging... Hardcore. She got a new car, he got a new truck, they got a home built from the ground up, new toys, etc. Then he got fired. Now he's back. But he even told me during all if this turmoil that he's in tons of debt. I mean, it made sense... And he had a house before with her that was totally fine. He should've stayed in that smaller home and just saved his money. I guess he wanted to really show off in a way. 


I told my wife and she agrees - we dont want to be house poor. I want to be able to go out to eat every once in awhile, get a new game system, etc. I don't want an empty house where we have to eat ramen nightly."
financialindependence,fo1ban9,t1_fo1ajxe,1587429582.0,"Thank you so much for the response. I really appreciate it.


Yes, the property taxes are absolutely a huge factor in pushing people away. It's funny, because I've said that elsewhere and some people, for some reason, enjoy the high taxes. They say that it brings in higher paying jobs. While I guess that makes a little sense, there isn't many jobs here at the moment from what I've heard. And with such a mentality, you're driving the middle class to leave or stretch their budgets very thin, leading to a lesser quality of life. For example, instead of having half the taxes and saving it for a vacation, now they have to spend it on taxes, most of which is school taxes.


Something needs to be done for sure. The houses I look at have ""lower"" taxes. By lower I mean around $7-$8k. There are a few rare ones that are affordable, but it's rare. And they're generally small."
financialindependence,fo140je,t1_fo13tt8,1587425295.0,Lmao YES! I love joking about that show. It resonates so well with my post.
financialindependence,fo10lqv,t1_fo10545,1587423364.0,"I wish I could. My job is with the county and I'm vested for my pension this year I believe... Other than that I had a daughter out of wedlock at an early age of whom I have  sole custody, but I want my daughter to be able to see her mother for court ordered visitations. Also my family is here. Otherwise I totally would. I really, really wish I could."
financialindependence,fo0zzq6,t1_fo0zn1t,1587423019.0,"Makes sense. My wife live at home with my parents. I hate to say it, as we are 31, but we do contribute via rent, paying for food, helping out in the yard and around the house, etc. My cash goes mostly to debt (much of it medical stuff that comes up...) or into savings or investments. We have a decent little chunk of change saved up so far. And before we get a home I want most of her debt taken care of.


Anyway, that can be the only way I think of it given the income average and housing costs. And we aren't even looking at $400k houses. I search for like... Under $300k."
financialindependence,fo0zna1,t1_fo0zklf,1587422826.0,"I mean, that does make sense. I'm sure a lot of people ""got help"" via inheritance, presents, etc. Thank you"
financialindependence,fo0y72t,t3_g4otav,1587422018.0,"Who knows if this will even be seen, but I just don't get it. I live on Long Island - Suffolk county to be more precise, as do I work for them. The average household income is like $89k or so last I checked. But the houses plus property taxes are so much money. I can't comprehend how people afford it here? I make about $53k at the moment+ whatever my side business brings in ($0 at the moment due to the virus). My wife makes $31k and is almost done with medical and billing school. So we aren't too far beneath the average income, if not at it when my side business is doing decently.


Am I missing something? We want our own home already! But I told her not until she finishes school and gets a new job at least.


Any guidance is appreciated."
Economics,fo0addr,t1_fo0aaen,1587408980.0,Very true. I wish you the best of luck :)
Economics,fo09tod,t1_fnz8f04,1587408630.0,I hear ya... I work full time and make $3918/month BEFORE taxes.and deductions. After those it's more like $2600. People are making more than us sitting home doing nothing while people like us have to drag our asses to work.
AskMenOver30,fnzmn28,t1_fnxb7i0,1587396952.0,"I totally agree. It's really sad and pathetic... I honestly believe that it makes the woman lose respect for them because they're lacking a backbone. And the gym thing... A lot of people gain a ton of weight when they get super comfortable. Eating out, stopping the gym, etc. is a diabolical combination. And then the woman loses attraction to them... I wonder why! 


At 29, idk man, people have different lives and variables. But from what you say, he makes horrendous choices. I live at home still with my parents (and wife and kid) because NY taxes us into Oblivion. But as long as we contribute, I don't find it an issue. We pay rent, I help around the house and yard, we pay our bills and work full time. When my wife finishes school in a month or two hopefully she gets a better paying job.


Back to guys that ghost... The sad part is that I fully believe that women lose their respect and eventually leave. Like if a guy can't make their own minds and even switch their minds on something because their girl said something else, it shows they're indecisive and easily swayed. It's sad. Then the guy eventually comes back to his friends when the girl leaves... And I don't think many would want such a person as their friend again."
