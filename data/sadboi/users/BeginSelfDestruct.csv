This is a pandemic. People are dropping like flies and that's what happens during a pandemic. If we had giant ovens to mass cremate bodies and just put the ashes into a giant memorial for the dead, I think that would be best. We truly cant afford to be housing bodies like this.

I understand that people want funerals and to honor the dead, but this is a pandemic and such things arent plausible."

More time for peace which always makes me think that living alone is better than living with others. That is, until I have an episode.

My episodes may be fewer but they're much worse when I have no one to calm me. I spiral out of control and being in my home becomes absolute hell that I can't escape. I had an episode when I wrote this because I was having both depersonalization and derealization and how I wished someone was there to help me.

And then it was over and I immediately went back to thinking that living alone is better.

A horrible cycle that never ends."

I was stung once on my jaw, thrice on my neck, twice on my hand, and once on my forearm. I was sleeping at the time and woke up to my arm feeling like it was on fire. Like had put my arm in an actual campfire and left it there.

Then I started getting fire and cold feelings in my neck and jaw.

I started losing feeling in my fingers and felt like I couldn't close my hand.

After that i felt as if i were going to pass out (that could also be because I was having a panic attack)

After about an hour to an hour and a half of excruciating pain I started feeling numbness especially in my jaw and hand.

All this went away after about 6 to 8 hours on me, but I no longer have feeling in a portion of my forearm which doesn't effect me at all.

My dad was stung twice on the leg and couldnt walk on his leg for a day because it went numb.

It's a scary thing to happen but it is definitely not the end of the world. Hurts like absolute hell though.
