UnearthedArcana,fq8bdr3,t1_fq83qj1,1589162389.0,"Thanks! Since shield master gives evasion, and this shield also gives a limited evasion, there are two ways you could rule it.  Either they don't overlap, or, the way I'd rule it: they do stack.

If you are in the aoe of, say a fireball, and you pass you Dex save, no problem you take no damage.  But, if you fail your save, you can have the shield take the damage you would have taken, and take no damage, as well as reducing the damage of any of your friends who are behind the extended shield.  Overpowered? Maybe, but it's a rare enough occasion imo."
TrollXChromosomes,fq70tpk,t1_fq6g4bc,1589140322.0,"To be fair to the Witcher Netflix show, the sword fights Geralt has with unarmored opponents is much more realistic than many other shows. Obviously it's not perfect, as Geralt literally has superhuman reflexes and pain tolerance, if not just a resistance to being stabbed, however that works. But many shows show characters trading sword blows for minutes without wearing full plate and not taking more than a few scratches, whereas in the first episode when Geralt gets jumped by a mob, they're all dead within a minute and Geralt has several wounds that would be serious on a normal person, because they're all unarmored.

The witcher books and especially the games aren't the best with having good female characters, though, as pretty much every primary female character except two I can think of are Geralt's love interests at some point or another in the books and violence against woman is really normalized in the games."

UnearthedArcana,fplxg0a,t1_fplwktm,1588721342.0,"Then how do you justify the bonus to Dex saves that half and three-quarters cover gives you in the base rules?  The effect continues as normal, but there's a small space behind the shield that's not affected.  The Dex save is to get into that space, just like how normal evasion presumes there's a spot where you're unaffected without leaving your 5ftx5ft square, even if it's a wall of fire or an explosion, and the Dex save is to get into that space.

You do make a good point that I should add, the evasion is only if the effect comes from a point on the other side of the shield.  A fireball starting behind you, then, wouldn't allow you to evade because you're not behind the shield anymore, you're in front of it."

UnearthedArcana,fplj4p1,t1_fpkg36q,1588713638.0,"The way I think this balances with shield master is that it can overlap, yes, so someone with any sort of evasion can possibly *never* take damage (as long as the shield has the hp to spare) but also it possibly affects two allies as well.

UnearthedArcana,fpktc2t,t1_fpkd672,1588700682.0,"At that point, it can no longer take attacks as part of the brace feature because that requires it to take damage, but it can still be used as half-cover via the hunker down feature."

UnearthedArcana,fpksbb1,t1_fpjyg5r,1588700175.0,"At that point, you can still use it as a mobile half-cover, but you can't use the brace feature as that requires the shield to take the damage for you."
UnearthedArcana,fpkrom9,t1_fpke3i5,1588699858.0,"I did think about charges vs. hp, and the reason I went with hp is that I want there to be some strategy to when the brace feature is used.

changemyview,fp46761,t1_fp44j5j,1588292487.0,"I think it is important to note, while unrelated to the actual question of appropriation, that while black and christian culture do overlap, there is no equivalent to communion in black culture because their original religion was forcibly removed from them and several cultural groups were forced together.  Someone non-christian crossing themselves cannot compare to a continued sort of oppression against a group of people who had their home, language, and culture all stolen from them."
changemyview,fp41dlz,t1_fp3ucva,1588289775.0,"No, but I see how I could come across that way. What I meant was that the act of a white person taking things from a black culture has a lot more meaning than a japanese person taking things from a christian culture. Yes, communion is more sacred and culturally important than rap. But black culture has had its elements (as well as many other things) stolen by oppressors multiple times, by white people, so continued appriation of black culture by white people has more meaning than many other examples."
changemyview,fp3pvv7,t1_fp3dwhx,1588283648.0,"The key phrase is ""as a whole"".  Yes, Christians have been oppressed historically and in some places to this day.  However, in the west, Christians have been the oppressors, not the oppressed, for many centuries.  Or, in the case of Catholics vs. Protestants, oppression has existed on both sides of the feud.  Christian oppression is entirely unlike, say, black or Jewish oppression, *especially* in America, which has been a majority Christian nation since it was colonized."
changemyview,fp3cl1r,t1_fp39c5p,1588276960.0,"Those examples are used not because all examples of cultural appropriation are for something sacred, or that people shouldn't care if something is exchanged that isn't sacred, but because those are elements of White, Christian, American, or some mix of all three's culture that is important to them.

The ""real"" importance of cultural appropriation depends on two things: how important the cultural item is, *and who is taking it*. Americans, White people, and Christian people have historically rarely been on the other side of oppression, as a whole,  or if they have, like the irish, in America they've mostly assimilated. For people who are considered minorities, this is not the case and assimilation has been actively prevented by both sides. For a black person, who had their original african culture literally stolen from them, to also have their new american culture 'taken' from them, like with rock or rap music, that has a lot more meaning than a japanese person turning communion wafers into a snack.

Another thing to note is how the original meaning is often left behind, an original meaning that was often very important to the culture that created it.  Blues, and later rap, was often explicitly about black issues before white producers found a white person (who had grown up in black culture) like Elvis or Eminem and made them a star, turning black culture with black voices about black issues into music everybody (white people) could enjoy.

Finally, none of this is a hard-and-fast rule. The best example I have of this are Golems. Magical constructs of people that are often used to protect or guard things.  This too, was at one point, cultural appropriation. The Golem is a Jewish myth, about a rabbi with a deep connection to God who creates his own man from clay just like God did, places the true name of God in its mouth, writes the word ""truth"" on its forehead, and sets it to protecting the jews of Prague. The Golem, having not been created by God but still powered by his holiness, is not a magical creature but a holy one. It must follow God's rules, especially the Sabbath, or else God's power will leave it and it will start to kill everything. It is made of clay, and not anything else, because people were originally made from clay by God. It has the word ""truth"" inscribed on it, which gives it direction. It protects the jews of Prague. Most of these elements are not found in modern versions of golems, and if they are they are perverted and warped. But, golems are simply a part of western folklore now. Why? I don't know, but I have a few theories. A) Jewish culture is fairly assimilated into many western cultures. B) The myth of the Golem was willingly brought into western culture by Jewish authors, making it not 'stolen'. C) Jews are simply okay with our (yes, our, I am a Jew) culture being traded away for greater acceptance in our communities. D) It was stolen so long ago (the myth was prominent I'm the middle ages, so maybe during the crusades?) that no one cares anymore.

Cultural appropriation is a tricky subject, and if you are worried that you might be doing it in your creations, you have two ways of going about it. Either find people from the culture you are worried about and make sure you are representing it respectfully and faithfully, or don't take cultural elements from cultures that have been historically oppressed."

dndmemes,fnybw7x,t1_fnwyhkr,1587358638.0,"There's also an important difference between quantum ogre and changing the same encounter.

For example, you give your party two paths. Left leads into a monster's nest, Right doesn't, and there's no take-backsies.  Now, if you want to have the monster fight you can prep two fights: one in the monster's lair (left), and the other where the monster hunts down the party later (right). You still have both player choice and the encounter you wanted to run.

However, it's not always so easy to see what choices the party has, and so when the players avoid an encounter I prepared, I think about if it would make sense to either a) refactor the fight for the next session with some changes, b) pull the fight but keep it in mind in case I need to add an encounter much later down the line, or c) scrap it all together."

In this way, you can flavor bad luck happening.  ""Your rapier stabs towards the bandit, but catches on a coin in his pocket instead of piercing his flesh."" ""As you started to speak, you caught a funny scent and let out the least intimidating sneeze you can imagine."" ""The spell flies from your fingertips, but the goblin trips and it whizzes over his head."" ""You managed to slip your dagger between the plate armor on the evil knight, but he barely seems affected.  You must have missed every important organ by a hair."" And more things along this line.  In this way, the characters are given the opportunity to notice the horrible luck they occasionally get.

Incidentally, the reverse is true.  When the players decide to use the ring, the character isn't really aware of any dice.  They just know that they used a charge from this ring, and when they tried to haggle a message arrived from the merchant's wife saying that she had given birth to twins, and the merchant was so happy he gave everyone in the store a discount.

For the rarity of the coins, I was conflicted about that. In terms of power, it likely doesn't pass Common, as always landing heads or tails might only be useful if you were trying to scam someone.  But the item is explicitly incredibly rare, with no more than three dozen in existence in the whole world. I don't know how that affects the rarity, and figured I would just leave it blank."

I'm not sure exactly what happened, as when using the ""create a new article and link it"" option, it creates a full article that you can find in your article list and delete or edit from there.  It is maybe possible that instead, it created what I like to call ""threads"" or places that an uncreated article can link back to. Those aren't real articles, and are only visible as links to authors of your world.

Let me put it this way: there's this undescribed person, A. You don't know what they look like, you don't know what gender or sex they are.

Now what if the girl, still cis, still wearing a strapon, fucks you in the ass or you suck on the strapon? Still, it's a boy and a girl, it doesn't matter what is happening between them, that's still straight, right?

Let's change the hypothetical a little. Two cis girls have sex. One of then wears a strapon. Is that straight? There's a (fake) dick involved, but it's two girls, so it's gay.

So what is the difference, then, between a girl wearing a strapon and a girl ""wearing"" a biological dick? They're both girls, and in all of the situations above it should be pretty clear that the inclusion of a dick doesn't change the sexuality of the situation."

Secondly, yes, the nation was founded by christians who made christian laws, like saying ""so help me god"", which the christian majority sees no problem with and so won't change.

Thirdly, yes, the US has always been racist. We were one of the last ones to ban slavery, and we had to fight a whole war over it.

Fourthly, both India *and* the US are currently secular nations. However, you claim that the current leadership of India ""wants a hindi nation"", like how the US is christian nation.

dndmemes,fiqee2o,t1_fiogikx,1582642428.0,"The problem comes from the number of encounters. The DMG says that a party can take 6-8 medium to hard encounters per long rest, and 2 short rests per long rest. If you use this format, long rest characters feel a lot closer to short rest characters in terms of power level and ability. However, most DMs only have 2 encounters a day, except in dungeons where this balance is better followed. This really heavily skews long rest characters to feeling more powerful, because resources they should have to spread out thinly can be used liberally.  When using a longer rest rules variant, it is much easier to fit in 6-8 encounters per long rest.

There are also things you can do to increase the enjoyment of the large amounts of downtime the players will have by resting, and more downtime can mean more time for characters to interact in more pure RP.

It also does favor slower campaigns, ones where the world is steadily progressing around the characters, but it might take a little bit for the next big plot point to be revealed.

I personally am a fan of 4 hour short rests and 24 hour long rests, which means even short rests require some safety and you regularly have time for downtime activities, but it's not as harsh as a full week break from the story."
