EDAnonymous,fm0qtz3,t1_fm0qq4f,1585664326.0,"No worries, I tried to clarify in my post a bit better as well cause I didn’t want people to think I was talking about Reddit lol"
EDAnonymous,fm0olhe,t1_flzsqi7,1585662960.0,"I totally understand. I find in the ED subreddits it doesn’t bother me in the same kind of way because of the fact that going into these sub forums I know exactly what I’m getting. What’s really hard is when I’m showing up for zoom meetings for work and people are talking about it or for my classes, I’m just like please god no not here"
EDAnonymous,fm0oec5,t1_flzqyd6,1585662835.0,"Not talking about this sub, I’m talking about on places like FB and insta. As I said, this is in reference to a lot of diet and weight talk increasing online from people who aren’t suffering from EDs"

DID,fkqiwet,t1_fkpdl28,1584447341.0,So sorry this has been rough for y'all :(
EDAnonymous,fkozzw4,t1_fkozbch,1584398741.0,YEEEEEPPPPP God I feel this so hard. All my classes/work/schedule have been cancelled so I have nothing to do except restrict/binge/purge and it's the actual worst. I lost all the structure in my life and it's a fucking mess. It's even harder when you have to deal with other mental health issues (I can relate to the alcohol bit in terms of my usage of weed) Went from being full sobriety to smoking every day which doesn't help my ED :(
EDAnonymous,fkozdjy,t1_fkoz1ry,1584398355.0,"Honestly, it's a hot mess. People hoarding food is making my anxiety so much worse cause of not having access to my safe food/support services. I'm so sorry things have been rough for you. I hope you will make it through this rough period. See if you can video call your psychologist, that's what I am doing with mine! Sending hugs and strength"

EDanonymemes,fk2ubrl,t3_ffwlem,1583809358.0,ED is also short for executive dysfunction which i also LOVE experiencing cause my brain never fucking works.
EDanonymemes,fk2tjt8,t3_fg3a53,1583808827.0,pussy juice calories. deadass googled that once after eating out my gf
diet,fk2tczb,t3_fg6ys8,1583808701.0,"I answered your survey, just wanna add one note: I'd be pretty open to eating bugs in the future because I know they are high in protein but I don't feel they are very accessible in some parts of the world. Makes me wonder if they would be expensive. I'd be a lot more inclined if they were easier to access."
EDanonymemes,fk2sknx,t3_fg4n7u,1583808183.0,too scared i'll break the rope cause i'm too fat if i try to hang myself
EDAnonymous,fk2sblf,t3_ffzoma,1583808016.0,I'm so addicted to watching mukbang in general. It's probably because I wish I could let myself eat things they do but never will/ if I watch them eat I will feel better about myself for not eating. It's like a serious problem though. Sometimes it's all I do with my day :(
transED,fk2s6oj,t3_fekhb9,1583807928.0,I feel this every fucking dayyyyy. I've heard that there are binders for your hips that apparently work well according to my other nb friend so maybe that could be helpful?
EDanonymemes,fk2r4on,t3_fg1wxo,1583807234.0,HAHAHA fuck i just did this
EDAnonymous,fk2qp0r,t3_ffwmej,1583806949.0,I relate to this so much. I have a lot of friends who don't eat very much and every time we go out for food I always feel so insecure about how much I eat.
EatingDisorders,fk2q8ps,t3_fft4ix,1583806653.0,"I've had some pretty similar experiences with struggling with binging on sweets and other foods. I know from being in recovery that due to the nature of my ED, my binging is usually caused by my restriction. I am still working on a lot of food exposure and unfortunately I usually just avoid highly triggering foods. My nutritionist and I have worked through food exposure and talking through feelings around eating foods together I would binge on or be scared of to put  a voice to the feelings and sit with it. I've found this exposure helpful but it is very hard and takes time. I have also tackled some of my binge temptation foods by allowing myself to have a little bit in order to honor my craving but recognize I don't have to binge. I hope some of this information is a bit helpful!"
EatingDisorders,fjj8ys2,t3_fdhxtg,1583386852.0,"Hi OP, I wanna preface my comment as someone who is non-binary trans and has an eating disorder. As others have mentioned, unfortunately many people within the LGBTQ+ community struggle with eating disorders. In my own experiences, I find that my ED is heavily related to feeling insecure around how my body looks in relation to my gender. I think it's always helpful to give your friend the space to make their own choices as it can be really hard for people with EDs to even recognize they need help. I agree with others comments about focusing the conversation around how he is doing and if there are ways you can support him or advocate for him instead of mentioning potentially triggering topics like weight or body size or food. If possible maybe look into LGBT+ resources that are near you to see if he may be able to access supports or groups from those. (If you're in the US for example you could look up Planned Parenthood since they have some LGBT+ supports). Additionally, maybe as things go on seeing if you can support him by being there for him or accompanying him to any support meetings or finding resources. In my experience, my ED makes it very hard to remember people around me love me and I've found having a strong support system that is there for me even during my worst periods has helped me want to recover and try to care for myself better. Best of luck!"

EUGENIACOONEY,ezqdsrx,t3_d1mx0h,1568057955.0,"Hiya, I don’t wanna say anything for certain but I figured I could chime in with some information about eating disorders and their impacts on the body. Eating disorders, especially restrictive ones have an impact on your bones and vitamin levels which can overall lead to higher risks of osteoporosis and osteopenia. I don’t want to say anything for sure but when I’ve noticed that as my eating disorder got worse the more I hunched because my bones were constantly in pain. Just a thought that this could be a contributing factor but I’m not certain of anything."
