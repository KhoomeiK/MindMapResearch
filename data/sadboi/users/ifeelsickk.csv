depression,fq41hby,t3_ggm8fw,1589072653.0,I feel this. That’s why I feel like idk for sure if I have actual problems or if it’s all in my head.
depression,fpp45zf,t3_gea6mo,1588795651.0,"This hits too hard. It hurts. I’ve felt like this all my life. I feel like this now. This is why I feel like if I was gone, it wouldn’t really matter to anyone. And I feel so unloved and uncared for. This bothers me a lot that I don’t have a best friend. :((( I wanna die"
depression,fp3xnxc,t3_gav8bz,1588287736.0,Exactly me :(
depression,fozy7ge,t3_ga09qc,1588198991.0,"On another note, I’ve actually started writing a suicide letter myself. I’m not sure when or even if I’ll do it but I’ve started it just in case because I like to write and I want my emotions all out in case the time comes I’m not the one to write the minute before I die. I want it to be detailed and meaningful."
depression,fozmswr,t1_fozmmqa,1588193281.0,I feel you bro
depression,fozcqfl,t3_ga09qc,1588188470.0,"If you don’t want to explain, that’s okay but what was talked about in the letter? I’m just curious."
depression,fowxhxx,t1_fnmn2vo,1588129280.0,Aww that’s actually pretty sweet that convo y’all just had <3
depression,fowwziq,t3_g9p1vy,1588128963.0,I have bad anhedonia!!!! I literally don’t care to do anything nothing is fun for me anymore everything is boring and things like shopping and spending time with people make me so tired and bored
depression,fost3ew,t3_g92rsa,1588037482.0,I feel this so badly. I feel like this all the time-like nobody loves me. It’s a very disturbing feeling and I get these feeling late at night and I start to feel sick to my stomach and very sad and upset. I feel like ending my life ... 💔
depression,fo4pxtt,t3_g5g0xd,1587508961.0,"But then again, the ones who are assholes and do stupid shit that are actually low-life individuals should. But they’re too self-centered to see that. If I was them-I’d definitely hate myself lmao."
depression,fo4pbkf,t3_g5g0xd,1587508621.0,"I get what you’re saying but honestly I think a little differently. Instead, I think how can anyone ever hate themselves. I think this because I feel like such a piece of shit that I see everyone as better than me. I feel incompetent and inferior to others so god damn much. So in my opinion, I can’t see why anyone would have themselves- they’re better than me anyway. :(("
depression,fnthoiu,t3_g3ljni,1587241862.0,Yes I always think about this. Like I think I definitely lack social skills that I didn’t gain as a child and now I tend to not know how to keep a friendship going so I don’t really speak to anyone when I depart my separate ways from think like when school is out and everyone goes back home etc but then I remember that they could have also been talking to me this whole time too if they cared about me

depression,fnmtq9p,t3_g2omvo,1587077986.0,"Oh my gosh bro I am in the same place as you. You are not alone. I’m 18, so I understand that i may not be in the same boat as you but I feel like I will be old and still a virgin and I haven’t even kissed, cuddled, held, or even came into that much contact with people hardly ever. I don’t even get hugs that often, and when I have it’s a friendly side hug. It’s been so long since I have a hug. I’m here if you ever need me and if you do, please, please, PLEASE don’t hesitate to reach out to me. We can be friends if ya want :)) take care"
depression,fnkggd4,t3_g21qph,1587026117.0,"Yeah I totally get this. I especially don’t want people going through my diaries, with the disturbing stuff I’ve talked about and drawn in them. There’s a total of 7 diaries since age 13 (5 1/2 years ago) and there’s just too much i don’t want people to see. I’ve thought about burning them if I ever ended my life."
depression,fm9i7gx,t3_ftoulw,1585869252.0,"Oh my god same!! I literally think this shit all the time! I have been feeling super depressed lately and people say stuff like “just distract yourself. Find something to do that you like” etc etc and I’m like number 1, I don’t even like anything to begin with and 2. Hobbies do not make me feel any better and if they do, it’s only fucking temporary and then it’s back to hell."
