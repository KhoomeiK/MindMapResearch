And yes 100 percent there are shitty chiropractors who are there for a check and there are actually good ones who know what they are doing. I'm assuming they were older patients who died from artery dissection? That's very rare from all the research I've done. I have bad anxiety so if I go to a chiropractor I pretty much tell them I dont want the high velocity neck crack...for that reason."

ent,fndwuyz,t1_fndv7wi,1586878981.0,Triamcinolone acetonide. It's for inflammation and pain I believe?  I had the biopsy to check for Sjorgens. Or so I think.

My chest hurts where it connects to the sternum..about the first 3 or 4 ribs. Its tender to the touch. It's inflammation of the cartilage supposedly. Drs. Don't know shit about it besides take ibu for the rest of your life. Which I don't take that shit at all.
Anxiety,fmwfn7z,t1_fmwf5dj,1586445724.0,I hear ya. I've been dealing with it for about 3 years now or so. Everyday..nothing helps..I have kinda learned to live with it. People don't and wont understand if they have not dealt with it themselves. If I were to bench press i would absolutely aggravate it. If I were to swing a golf club I would feel it. Do you deal with anxiety on a daily basis?

And the side effects can be dangerous when taking these ""meds"", have you not read the papers they give you when you fill your prescription? Lol. And you can not just stop whenever you want..I've seen people who just stopped taking them after awhile of being on them..and it was hell. We are lab rats when it comes to anxiety meds whether you believe it or not. They dk if it's going to work for you or not. Do your own research instead of just listening to the Drs. Who get kick backs on all these pills they prescribe to people."

Plus down the road it's just gonna make it worse if you try coming off them. When they give you these ""meds"" they dont know if its gonna work anymore than you do. It's all a guessing game. I'd try massage therapy, chiropractic and acupuncture before i fall back on these so called meds. Just my opnion. You do what you think is best for you tho."
