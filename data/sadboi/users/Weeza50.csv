You See programming has many fields to work with when I came to know what is programming and learned the basics of python and started getting into web development I started to lose motivation as I progressed until I completely stopped for months.

&#x200B;

Last week I got into something called automation and it is really getting me excited every time I learn something about it

&#x200B;

in short : Try every field until you find the one that you enjoy at least that worked for me"

depression,ewdxfm4,t3_cnp2iz,1565309723.0,"For a while there was a lot in my mind lately all what I was thinking of is disappearing and never come back( same as you), and I was so scared of killing myself also (same as you) so I left my house for a walk and suddenly I realized that it is late , but I didn't want to go home I still had these thoughts so in my way I met a friend even though we didn't talk about any thing that was bothering me I just felt better

we sat together and called others to join us we didn't do anything but talking about different stuff

never let your depression thoughts take over you find anything that makes you busy

as for people not caring how exactly you want them to do so you can feel that you care?

&#x200B;

edit: Sorry for your loss and I hope you get over it soon"
