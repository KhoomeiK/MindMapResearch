HealthAnxiety,fkvxjak,t3_fkz3ul,1584578837.0,"Yes. Ever since they announced the virus was near me I’ve been feeling every symptom in the book. It’s anxiety. I promise you that. I was coughing like hell two nights ago and drove myself home. I told my mom I might have the virus and she called me ridiculous, gave me a paper bag and I felt as healthy as ever. 

So the shortness of breath thing is tricky, but it’s most likely you being hyper aware of your breathing to the point you borderline hyperventilate. In my case I’ve been hyperventilating for days. 

I also feel kinda nauseous and having bad stools (of course only after I found out this was a symptom of Covid) I feel like I have a fever but really I’m just tripping. You could compare this situation to the Mad Snail Disease from Spongebob, if anything.

EDIT: I have asthma as well, so I took a puff of an inhaler and felt WORSE. So I was definitely hyperventilating."

You’re really not alone and the things you go through, we go through as well. Remember that. And if we’re all fine, then so are you.
