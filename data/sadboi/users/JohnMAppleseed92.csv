AskDrugNerds,fp0j6i7,t3_gaisyf,1588210330.0,"I want to avoid anecdotes here, and look at the science. At low doses, Seroquel is a serotonin antagonist of the autoreceptors, which actually causes more serotonin to be available in the brain for mood support. The autoreceptors do not play a role in mood support. 

Seroquel also allows more dopamine to be available in the brain at lower doses. And it is actionable at the histamine receptors. 

At higher doses, Seroquel becomes a full antagonist for dopamine and serotonin, like a typical antipsychotic such as Thorazine. 

Based off of this information, it wouldn’t be unbelievable for Seroquel to have recreational potential as a sedative to some users. I’m trying to avoid anecdotes here, but my two cents is that if you’re in prison or are absolutely bored out of your mind, Seroquel may be a good way to chill out a bit. Otherwise, it would most likely be used to allow an amphetamine user to sleep during the comedown.

2. Yeah, I have a lot of experience with benzos. I like them, but I think it’s important to be cautious with them and practice risk mitigation.
3. Not an expert, but want to give my experience, and it’s not irresponsible if you have magnesium carbonate (the remedy). It completely cured withdrawal.


MY EXPLANATION (here’s the specs to be more accurate)

Shared activation of KCNQ channels - GABA activates these channels, but because Gabapentin is a GABA analog, it acts like a secondary key to activate these channels that are naturally respondent to GABA. When These excitatory channels are acted upon by the inhibitory GABA, neuron excitability is suppressed. This is a typical mechanism of GABA, acted upon through KCNQ channels. 

Due to its similar chemistry, Gabapentin shares this mechanism with GABA, among others. Although it would be erroneous to claim that Gabapentinoids act on GABA directly, they share in the inhibitory mechanism on excitatory neurons at the aforementioned channel. There have been no conclusive studies on cross-tolerance, but it would be safe to assume that both benzos and gabapentinoids cause dysregulation (when dependence is established) of these critical anxiolytic and analgesic channels. Therefore, using them regularly would result in an established dysregulation of KCNQ channels (dependence).

TEXT

“A gabapentin binding site on KCNQ channels

We recently discovered that KCNQ3 and KCNQ5 are directly activated by the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, which binds close to the highly conserved S5 tryptophan, KCNQ3-W265 (Manville et al., 2018). In the current study, we show that gabapentin likewise activates KCNQ3 and KCNQ”"
gabapentin,foeh3r1,t1_fod4dzb,1587703622.0,"Wrongo! Sorry I read your response. It is well written but incorrect. 

Gabapentin is a Voltage Dependent Calcium Channel Inhibior, and although it does not affect gaba receptors directly, it does through the aforementioned indirect process. VDCCs inhibit excitation, as does GABA and benzos through these channels (edited to be more specific).

If you plan to stop quickly ensure you get lots of magnesium with an ATE at the end of the chemical compound name. These have a higher bioavailability to cross the blood brain barrier; they are NMDA receptor antagonists that will also upregulate GABA. I also recommend an antidiarrhea agent to assist with the magnesium side effects. 

Don’t take the klonopin for withdrawals, as klonopin has a long half life that can add a dependence and cause rebound anxiety. Klonopin  will downregulate GABA-a at the allosteric benzodiazepine site which will leave you with anxiety and possibly dependence after a week or a few weeks. Not worth it.

MDMA acts primarily on serotonin and does not have much (if any affinity to dopamine receptors, unless it’s cut with something). 

I would suggest if you think the adderall + phenibut feels anything like MDMA, you are either inexperienced with either compound or more than likely that you’ve been using shady pressed MDMA that probably contains meth. If you choose to do MDMA, please test it before taking it. Meth is no good. That being said adderall is great with phenibut, but I personally don’t feel like I need to add anything to phenibut because it’s plenty stimulating and great by itself."
