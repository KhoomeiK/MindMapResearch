nailbiting,fmevvry,t3_fuvakq,1586014668.0,"It could be nail bed damage, vitamin deficiency, genetics, nail ridges. I have similar issues with some of my nails having flat spots due to really bad nail ridges. I used to be really aggressive with my cuticles and once I started to be more gentle that helped. I still have some nails with wonky bits, but I‚Äôve just learned to live with it."
nailbiting,fmeu32t,t3_fuotxr,1586013535.0,You have to consider that your nails were so badly bitten that a lot of the initial growth is going to be nail bed repair. I see improvement! Right now you just have to let your nails heal and get healthy. You should be proud. Keep it up. üòä

realwitchcraft,fm8c0sf,t1_fm867iy,1585846630.0,"I agree. Especially with things of this nature, it‚Äôs nice to not feel alone. I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre purely Christian. I‚Äôm not religious myself so I don‚Äôt really know. The way I understand Guardians is a bit different. They don‚Äôt interfere with our free will, but they can give us intuitive guidance to help keep us safe. Apparently it‚Äôs pretty common for them not to make themselves known to the person they protect. I‚Äôm sure there are other views as well. I‚Äôve always thought Guardians were similar to Spirit Guides as well."

realwitchcraft,fm7z5wa,t3_ftf9p1,1585839702.0,"To me that seems more like some kind of guardian. Especially since it doesn‚Äôt feel hostile. 

I‚Äôve been told I have ‚Äúa watcher‚Äù who is there to protect me, but I have no idea who he is and he doesn‚Äôt like to make himself known to me. But I‚Äôve had multiple sensitive friends mention him or ask who ‚Äúthe man in the navy pea coat‚Äù is. 

I would say don‚Äôt worry about it unless the spirit makes you uncomfortable."
