Anyway, why develop over SSH? Because I'm running a Windows laptop right now, and all the stuff I'm writing code for uses Linux. So I end up having a bit of a conundrum, since the machine I'm developing on is entirely different than the machine that I'm actually going to be using, so I just decided to log into my Linux box remotely and write and test the code over there.

Not *super* clean, but it makes my life a bit easier since I don't have to worry about OS-specific stuff (ahhhemm, windows network stack), and Emacs also lets me split the screen to show local on the left and remote on the right, which makes swapping between the devices' terminals trivial. I could use SFTP to edit the remote file using a local editor but honestly that's more trouble than it's worth (I have the remote shell already so what's the point)."

Also I forgot to mention about my use of Vim-- everyone seems to have a distaste for my setup: Vim inside of GNU screen inside of ansi-term inside of Emacs (I use Emacs as a console window manager). Cursed I know, but makes sense if you know that screen lets me preserve my Vim window even if SSH drops, Vim is preinstalled on nearly everything (inc. embedded devices) while Emacs usually isn't, and I can keep my Emacs config on my local machine and use the default Vim bindings, which I'm already used to, on my machine _and_ over SSH."

The worst I've ever dealt with, which is small potatoes compared to the issue you described earlier but I thought would still be worth sharing, is trying to use IPv6 as a client on OVH's network. OVH gives each VPS one WHOLE ENTIRE /128 ADDRESS. How generous. I understand that there's a mere 340 trillion trillion trillion IPv6 addresses out there, but come on; this also came at the cost of pretty basic RFC compliance (just give me a /64!). It took me 3 fucking days to figure out why autoconfig was just not doing anything (NDP traffic was just dropped by the GW for one) while also somehow the gateway address was pingable. Turns out that it automatically configured 2001:db8:5353:105::1473/64 rather than 2001:db8:5353:105::1473**/128**, and when I did change the prefix to /128, it began working.

I do this sometimes before assigning static IPs so that the device actually uses the fucking static IP and not the one it got assigned 10 seconds beforehand. After I'm done, I set it back to something like 32767, because I don't want the annoyingly short leases anymore."
