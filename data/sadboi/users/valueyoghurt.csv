But as always, it didn‚Äôt work out. The previous times, it didn‚Äôt work out because the university didn‚Äôt recognise my perfectly legit qualifications, or because they advertised a course which didn‚Äôt exist, or because a family member got sick and I had to look after them. But this time was a fucking pandemic which got in the way so now I‚Äôm unemployed too.  
I have no rich relatives to inherit from or to lend me a hand. It‚Äôs just me and that‚Äôs the way it will always be. For some people, life just shuts on them non-stop and there‚Äôs no amount of saving $6 here and there which will get them out of a hole.

Trying to clean the apartment with a broken vacuum cleaner, or cook with broken pots and no food.

**Breathing**  
I‚Äôm asthmatic but my lungs haven‚Äôt felt this clear in years. I‚Äôm taking nice big breaths but my chest feels physically heavy all day and night. Like something is holding it down a bit. No cough.
  
**Throat**  
Scratchy feeling in throat, tonsils(I think?) are swollen on the right, as it often is when I‚Äôm sick/about to be sick. 
  
**Stomach**  
Diarrhoea on Wednesday, Thursday, tummy was in extreme discomfort but no diarrhoea Friday, tummy discomfort almost gone. Yesterday and today- zero tummy discomfort but still feel a bit ‚Äúweird‚Äù in the abdomen.  
  
**Mental health**  
I keep waking up far too early each morning after only 4 hours sleep. For the first few days, this was fine and I went about my day. But for the past 4 days, I‚Äôve fallen back asleep for a further 6~ hours. 10 hours is a pretty big sleep for me. I‚Äôve been gradually getting more and more fatigued and sleeping loads. Every morning I wake up feeling very hungover and like I can barely move. It improves throughout the day but, as I said, each day is slightly worse than the last.  
Constant mind fog like I forget what I want to say, in the middle of a sentence. Forgetting how to spell words, forgetting the word I want to say, memories fading somewhat.  
Part of the trouble with all of this is that I also suffer with pretty severe general anxiety and also health anxiety. All of the symptoms I‚Äôm experiencing (apart from perhaps the sore throat) could be caused by anxiety.  
  
**Other**  
No headache.  
Temperature pretty consistently normal, if a little on the low end, often, especially when I first wake up.  
Sense of smell and taste are normal  
No fever at all"

If I had to really guess, I‚Äôd say male, albeit a young male. Not a child though. Teenager or possible very early 20s."
offmychest,fkhwa58,t1_fkhw557,1584207159.0,Thank you!! Glad you‚Äôre doing better too! There should be a subreddit for people who recently had a big improvement from depression to keep the momentum going!
offmychest,fkhv4a2,t1_fkhuwm1,1584206533.0,"Thank you!!! :)  
Well I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd say things are going extremely well but things are the best they‚Äôve ever been. I still have days where I feel like the I‚Äôm crippled by depression but they only ever last one day. It‚Äôs a huge deal that I‚Äôm happy and calm almost every day. Everything is amazing, I thought this would never happen."

I‚Äôve been unhappy for a very long time but I‚Äôve just been laughing and having fun for so the last 4 months and it‚Äôs been great."

autism,f9rbunq,t1_f9rbjjr,1575574134.0,Yeah that‚Äôs true. There‚Äôs a conflict between trying to accept that‚Äôs just the way I am and trying to accept that I wish I was different.
autism,f9ra2e4,t1_f9r9uyn,1575573403.0,"I left after an hour haha. Everyone there will remember whether or not they found me awkward. I need to learn to accept it about myself, regretfully. I wish I was different but it‚Äôs wrong to feel so."

relationship_advice,f6igedv,t1_f6ifxm6,1572878081.0,It‚Äôs a derogatory way to talk about someone you haven‚Äôt even met. And she wasn‚Äôt using Instagram when we met.
relationship_advice,f6if1vd,t1_f6idv7d,1572877422.0,I don‚Äôt really see your point...? I haven‚Äôt stated anywhere that I do any of those things. You‚Äôre coming across as though you‚Äôre relishing the thought of a man (me) getting what he ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù just because other men did something you find distasteful. This kind of generalising divisiveness is just wrong.
