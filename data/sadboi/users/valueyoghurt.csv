AMA,fnvb2cc,t1_fnvab87,1587286595.0,"I said I’ll never have more than £1000. I have £50 currently and £6000 of debt from a software development course I just finished to get out of this hole. But as always, it didn’t work out. The previous times, it didn’t work out because the university didn’t recognise my perfectly legit qualifications, or because they advertised a course which didn’t exist, or because a family member got sick and I had to look after them. But this time was a fucking pandemic which got in the way so now I’m unemployed too.  
I have no rich relatives to inherit from or to lend me a hand. It’s just me and that’s the way it will always be. For some people, life just shuts on them non-stop and there’s no amount of saving $6 here and there which will get them out of a hole.  
Being poor is fucking hard enough without also being shamed by those more fortunate for wanting to occasionally enjoy some nice things like drinking in a cafe or going to watch a movie. Sometimes it’s nice to just sit, drink a coffee and try to forget that I live in the worst street in my city, with people shouting and fighting all night. Trying to clean the apartment with a broken vacuum cleaner, or cook with broken pots and no food.  
  
Sometimes it’s nice to pretend that there’ll be a million dollar inheritance coming my way one day. And that I have parents who can teach me how to invest and lend me some money with which to do it. Or that I have supportive friends who don’t judge me for my shitty living condition. Of that I’m not ashamed of my life....

**Breathing**  
I’m asthmatic but my lungs haven’t felt this clear in years. I’m taking nice big breaths but my chest feels physically heavy all day and night. Like something is holding it down a bit. No cough.
  
**Throat**  
Scratchy feeling in throat, tonsils(I think?) are swollen on the right, as it often is when I’m sick/about to be sick. 
  
**Stomach**  
Diarrhoea on Wednesday, Thursday, tummy was in extreme discomfort but no diarrhoea Friday, tummy discomfort almost gone. Yesterday and today- zero tummy discomfort but still feel a bit “weird” in the abdomen.  
  
**Mental health**  
I keep waking up far too early each morning after only 4 hours sleep. For the first few days, this was fine and I went about my day. But for the past 4 days, I’ve fallen back asleep for a further 6~ hours. 10 hours is a pretty big sleep for me. I’ve been gradually getting more and more fatigued and sleeping loads. Every morning I wake up feeling very hungover and like I can barely move. It improves throughout the day but, as I said, each day is slightly worse than the last.  
Constant mind fog like I forget what I want to say, in the middle of a sentence. Forgetting how to spell words, forgetting the word I want to say, memories fading somewhat.  
Part of the trouble with all of this is that I also suffer with pretty severe general anxiety and also health anxiety. All of the symptoms I’m experiencing (apart from perhaps the sore throat) could be caused by anxiety.  
  
**Other**  
No headache.  
Temperature pretty consistently normal, if a little on the low end, often, especially when I first wake up.  
Sense of smell and taste are normal  
No fever at all"

The only nice thing which could happen in my life at this stressful time would be a tasty meal which I can’t even eat.  
Also, things were going so well. I’d almost overcome my anxiety but now it’s here very severely. My sinuses are inflamed from being stuck indoors for a week and I keep waking up after only 3 hours sleep. I cry in fear to my partner every night and she is getting work out by it all.

You deserve to feel happy and content with life. It isn’t about what happened to us, it’s about how we have coped with it. Some people cope with things better than others. I can cope with times being tough but maybe you can run long distances while ignoring the pain, if you get what I mean.

offmychest,fkha4hb,t1_fkh9zr2,1584193479.0,"Thank you. I hope so too. And I’m glad it made your day. It’s been a very hard life, and especially these last 4 years. I’ve been unhappy for a very long time but I’ve just been laughing and having fun for so the last 4 months and it’s been great."
KindVoice,fe37ly8,t3_enpfz3,1578846725.0,I’ve been feeling pretty good lately and would be more than happy to help out. My DMs are always open.

autism,f9rbunq,t1_f9rbjjr,1575574134.0,Yeah that’s true. There’s a conflict between trying to accept that’s just the way I am and trying to accept that I wish I was different.
autism,f9ra2e4,t1_f9r9uyn,1575573403.0,"I left after an hour haha. Everyone there will remember whether or not they found me awkward. I need to learn to accept it about myself, regretfully. I wish I was different but it’s wrong to feel so."

relationship_advice,f6igedv,t1_f6ifxm6,1572878081.0,It’s a derogatory way to talk about someone you haven’t even met. And she wasn’t using Instagram when we met.
relationship_advice,f6if1vd,t1_f6idv7d,1572877422.0,I don’t really see your point...? I haven’t stated anywhere that I do any of those things. You’re coming across as though you’re relishing the thought of a man (me) getting what he “deserves” just because other men did something you find distasteful.

relationship_advice,f6hyb9c,t1_f6hy79z,1572868091.0,"Well, you guessed wrong. I won’t engage in these kind of childish assumptions."
