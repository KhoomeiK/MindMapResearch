But really I feel the same way. I'm dropping down to part time because this pandemic really puts it all in perspective. I'm going to be poor whether i work 40hrs or 30. I might as well have time for my family and myself. I really haven't had work and home life balance for a while.  I can't make up that time, but I can start now. 

Here's the crappy thing, Walmart is not going to lose sleep over you. They're doing their best to take care of employees and run a business. You have to stand up for yourself. If that means demote, do it. It's ok. If that's not your style, see if you can take some time off. You need to destress. OGP is only going to get busier.

I hope you find a solution. Stay healthy and good luck!"

I've been less argumentative lately too. The other day my aunt was talking about political stuff and I was able to keep my comments to myself. Instead of being irritated, I'm just like 'whatever.'

I am well over 200, but the 20lb was a bit too heavy for me. I couldn't sleep with it. I have a tendency to kick blankets off. It was heavy to pull up. Although it's a great weight for anxiety or restlessness. I use a heavy down comforter now and I love it. I feel secure. I can kinda 'hide' in the folds and fluff of the blanket.

OGPBackroom,fo83y2t,t3_g654xl,1587589473.0," ""Yes men"" always have a one up. Willing (and excited) to do whatever is asked of them. Example, a co worker got grocery dm but he's pretty dumb. But he's a yes man and really approachable. He's got charisma skills maxed out and always in a great mood. Never a bad attitude. I understand exactly why he got chosen. Anyone can be taught the processes but it's hard to change someone's behavior. 

I can tell you are proud of the work you do! That's why you get into arguments. Youre passionate about doing a good job. People who don't care, aren't interested in making improvements. There is a way of delivering feedback without being argumentative. Things changes all the time and being able to adapt is crucial. 

 Just something to consider. Good luck!"

I'm 34 and occasionally have nightmares where im in a yelling match with her. She passed away 10 years ago. I know its fucked up but im glad she's not around. It gave me a chance to be my own person. 

As for my dad, well, he saw me during a psychotic manic episode. I thought i was god, i thought i was on a tv show, etc. After that, he's not phased by much any more. 

I resented them for not getting me proper help. They were doing what they thought was best. Its hard to take mental illness seriously. It just looks like laziness, being moody or dramatic. 

I kinda had to self destruct in order for them to take me seriously. I dont recommend it. If you cant convince them by just talking, distancing yourself might be worth a try."
