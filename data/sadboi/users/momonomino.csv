We are so caught up on movies and shows. Wine watched Adventure Time so many times that kiddo can tell me what episode is about to play based off the title. 

I still cook healthy, nutritious meals for dinner every night, but all bets are off during the day. I make my kid eat at least one reasonably healthy thing during the day, but after that it's a whole lot of random snacks.

It doesn't have much to do with the holiday, I just like showing him I care. 

For mother's day, he woke up early and did the dishes. Best present ever, since I'm a stay-at-home mom. We're also ordering dinner instead of me cooking. But you know what? If none of those things happened, I wouldn't be upset in the slightest. I didn't even mention the day to my kid at all, because I really don't care. 

However, OP does care. This boils down to miscommunication. She cares, and her husband doesn't know she cares. This is a problem, but no one is necessarily at fault, unless OP has made it clear before that she cares. If he knows and continues to do nothing, then he sucks.

AmItheAsshole,fq6s7vh,t3_ggzoii,1589137169.0,"NTA. 

My daughter just got her very first diary for her 6th birthday. It has a lock and everything. My husband and I made it very clear to her that it is HER space to write whatever she wants, and we will NEVER read it unless she hands it to us and tells us to. It is so important for people, regardless of age, to have a safe space to let out their feelings, and it is appalling to me that your mother not only violated your safe space, but is now using it against you. 

You should be angry. She had no right to do that to you, and I'm so sorry your privacy was taken from you."
AskReddit,fq1xqat,t3_gge8dn,1589050918.0,"When I was a freshman in high school, a kid who had graduated the year before died. I had met him - my middle school and high school were sister schools, so I had been there for exposure to the choir program. He was a senior when I met him but he was so warm and welcoming, it really made an impression on me and convinced me to go to that school instead of the dedicated performing arts school I'd been considering. 

He died halfway through my freshman year. He'd been at a party tripping on mushrooms. Cops busted up the party and, to escape them, he ran out of a window. It was something like 5 stories off the ground (it's been 15 years so exactly what story he was on escapes me).

My school was so somber when the news broke. Almost everyone there knew this kid and had some story of him being awesome to them. There was a moment of silence in every single period. Lunch was silent, as were passing periods. Most of the day was spent without doing any schoolwork. It really made me think about whether or not this kid had realized his death would affect an entire school population, and I credit that day for turning around a lot of my angst at the time."
Parenting,fq1wdsz,t1_fq10zxb,1589050333.0,"That's how we always phrase it too. Our daughter is 6, and we've always told her we don't keep secrets from each other, but we can surprise each other with things. Now that she's a little older, we've told her she's allowed to have private thoughts (she just got a diary, for instance, and to us that is her own private, sacred space that we will not disturb) but that we still don't keep secrets from each other."
AskReddit,fq00uqy,t1_fpzm4hj,1589026425.0,"Literally every time I've taken mushrooms (6 times), I've known I was going to die. Even the two times I had a good experience, it was a, ""I'm so glad I get to do this in my last hours,"" sort of experience. 

That's why I'm never doing mushrooms again. I can't handle that level of existential dread, even if it ends up being a good time."
AskReddit,fpzf34p,t1_fpygaki,1589017426.0,My sister has it. It took us forever to figure out what she is allergic to. No one believes it when they find out.
AskReddit,fpvm2tp,t1_fpu2344,1588947500.0,"I am just like your husband. I see why you think the textures of water chestnuts and bean sprouts are similar, but I really do think the size difference is an important factor here. Water chestnuts are like biting into a quarter + sized vegetable of crunchy, watery sadness, whereas bean sprouts are so small they're more just a textural component."
Marriage,fppxyqz,t3_geks7a,1588811323.0,"Our daughter sleepwalked into our room during the act and we didn't notice until the end (she was seriously silent and sleeping). Hubby tried to ask her about it to make sure she was okay. She said, ""it seemed like you were having fun."" Then she went back to sleep. She doesn't remember it."

theyknew,fpo00o2,t1_fpnzecl,1588775906.0,"I'm 28 and OAD. My husband and I don't want any more kids, but because I COULD, I can't get the surgery that could affect my fertility. No doctor I've seen will consider a hysterectomy, even though my monthly issues are debilitating and I have several older family members who have had hysterectomies. 

If you want another baby though, go for it! My mom had her last baby at 45, and my sister is such a cool kid. If you want it and your body can handle it, go for it!"
theyknew,fpnyoad,t1_fpnybdr,1588775188.0,I begged my doctor to take it all out. She wouldn't do it because I'm too young. Hormonal BC causes more problems than it solves so I'm just dealing. Endo club!

AmItheAsshole,fpnuk2l,t1_fpntxt8,1588772890.0,"I'll consider that. Right now I'm playing nice so my mom and siblings won't have to deal with his anger. When he found out my husband and I bought a house (5 months after the fact), he spent his whole weekend angry at my siblings for not telling him sooner. He then, a couple weeks later, told my mom he was cutting support by $500 a month because she ""wasn't being forthcoming about things"". They aren't officially divorced yet because he won't sign anything, and without a lawyer yet she can't fight what he sends her."
