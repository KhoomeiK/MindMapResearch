You're not alone - many people experience seasonal depression or anxiety due to things being impacted by the local climate, weather, or holiday season. I wouldn't call it odd so much as I'd call it a healthy normality, as our moods are often shaped by things (or lack of things) happening in our lives.

Personally, I loath corporate holidays, like Xmas, Easter, Valentine's Day, and Halloween because of how much consumerism has taken over so I usually don't do much of anything to celebrate them, and often feel lonely or sad when they come around.

**Sorry to vent, TLDR is at the bottom.**

While I have always been open to talking things out with people instead of becoming angry, I really needed to hear the second part of this sentence because I've just started to realize working 50-60 hour weeks in the technology sector of a large corporate company is starting to kill me mentally.

I have an extremely difficult time coping with mountains of ""tech debt"", siloing, lack of transparency, and little to no documentation, all of which compound themselves into a mental block for me. This was less of a problem when I was working for small mom & pop shops with little existing IT to deal with, but then again, the pay was less too.

Now to be fair, things have been improving over the last year or so, but we continuously run into budgetary or other roadblocks caused by personalities, resulting in far too slow a change for my brain to handle. This leaves me feeling defeated and disappointed (but not angry) because the effort we're putting in to getting buy-in and actually implementing (then sticking with) change feels like it far outweighs the results.

The thought that this ""person"" (a corporate desk job in the IT industry) might not be right in my life anymore feels like a huge an understatement, but since teaching people how to use, repair, and purchase tech is all I know, and finding jobs with COVID-19 going on isn't easy at all, I'm very afraid to pack up and move on right now, especially due to my living situation.

Bingo, we have a winner. Most likely the game you're downloading from Steam needs to unpack / unzip portions of itself on your computer's storage drive before it can continue downloading. The fact that you can get 35-40 MBps (not the same as Mbps for anyone wondering) tells you the speeds are there, as would checking a speedtest like fast.com, speedtest.net, or similar sites.

How do I know? Because even though my gaming / IT Consulting computer has multiple SSDs, it does the same thing: downloads parts of game updates at full speed, then needs time to unpack them before it can download more. For example, last time I installed PayDay 2 it only needed to download around 16GB but ended up expanding to 22GB on disk.

Please note that this varies from game to game, launcher to launcher, update to update, and even day to day between the same game & launcher. I'm not privy to how these game platforms calculate what to do and when, but imagine they have algorithms that help balance the load on their servers, too."

Email servers are then configured to pull information from one or more of these lists which they then use to detect and prevent spam emails sent from a given IP, email address, or domain name.

In return for using these lists, email servers usually report back to the lists when users report emails as spam using a button/function within whatever interface the email server provides its users.

Some anti-spam configurations result in IP ranges being completely blocked *before* a connection is even made, usually because one of the block lists has seen an influx of spam emails being sent from the IP range.

This isn't about anti-spam legislation; this is about IP, email, and domain name reputation. Unfortunately, no detection system is perfect, so it's a trade-off of how the 20-30 year old email system works.
