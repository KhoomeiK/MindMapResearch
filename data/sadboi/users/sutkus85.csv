Don't see complaining about diversity there. Or is meant that just because that character happens to be female it's complaining about diversity? That'd be a stretch, wouldn't it? After all one of her victims is a pregnant woman. Context is important though, so maybe it'd be better to wait until release, maybe it's just a PR ploy by Naughty Dog. Who knows?"

Ah so diversity is more important than writing or lore? Sure, so in the next biopic about Mandela there would nothing be speaking against Mandela being an Asian lesbian girl as they're a minority in Africa? You wouldn't want to be a bigot against diversity now, would you? Otherwise how else could an asian lesbian woman identify with that character?

And looking at BF being the light in this as another example, true too. Why shouldn't there be Black or even Jewish Nazis, right? 

Isn't it funny how loved the Witcher TV series is even though it's really diverse, unlike the source material? Superb writing makes that possible. All characters are fleshed out and fit the lore and world and wouldn't you know, people are cheering, almost as if writing quality matters or something ;)

Another food for thought. If you see that your product lacks thought and quality why not just slap on some diverse characters? There will be people starting to defend it. And don't forget to call them bigots and sexists, that should catch on. But but whatever you do don't flesh them out especially if they're supposed to be important. How else could you market a shitty game/movie/whatever nowadays? Good products like Blade or Elder Scrolls take time and effort, we just want highest profits so screw all that quality crap, they're either won't notice or will defend it :D

At least you don't believe it's a conspiracy. That's a plus. What makes it different from other gems like SARS, swineflu or Ebola? If it'd be really brainless reacting wouldn't it have been activated for them as well?
