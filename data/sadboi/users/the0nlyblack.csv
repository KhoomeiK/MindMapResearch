exchristian,fpp6j7h,t3_geq8aj,1588796827.0,"I went to a Christian, private school from 6th to 11th grade. That school was a hell hole filled with privileged, racist assholes that used God as a justification for treating anyone that didn't fit directly into their mold as a less than sinner, destined for hell. And I'm not just talking students. 

Their ""god-honoring"" dress code caused a girl to commit suicide after being relentlessly bullied and harrassed by teachers and classmates. Over a dress that was too short.

In one of my Bible classes, a teacher who knew about my situation (being poor) made me come to the front of the class in 10th grade and talk about how grateful I was that God had given me a scholarship to be able to go there.

You are not alone. I've only been out of high school a couple years now but going to that school has filled me with so much anger and resentment."

My visual hallucinations are always dangerous people in the corner of my eye or just in my peripheral vision.

The tactile ones are a little more graphic.

It's tough because I also have complex PTSD so it's hard to tell which hallucinations are from what."

Putting on little space clothes (essential to getting in the zone for me)

Gather all my stuffies

Eat a little space food like nugs or pb&j

Watching cartoons/cartoons in the background

Even if you're not feeling it at first or you're feeling a little silly, just stick to it for a little while and let yourself settle into it naturally.

School let out at three. I wouldn't get picked up sometimes until six. It would get so late that occasionally my mom would come pick me up from her job because she got out at six.
