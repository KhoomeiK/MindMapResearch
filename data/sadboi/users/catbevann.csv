migraine,espf4ay,t3_c6pyn1,1562183387.0,"Me and a friend got it done at the same time, it didnâ€™t work for me but she had more success. We both had migraines that were on the right side, once she got the piercing hers got better but then found they moved to the left side. She plans to get the other ear pierced! Iâ€™ve worked with people that have said itâ€™s helped them as well, but itâ€™s hit and miss. Like others have said, if it doesnâ€™t help then you just have a cute piercing ðŸ˜Š"

TalkTherapy,erqmsfe,t1_erqjpxw,1561147058.0,"For me itâ€™s to do with the circumstances of why Iâ€™m in therapy this time round. Things are a bit more fresh and at the surface, so although crying is still hard, it seems to be easier. My body wants to do it, and my T provides a safe space for me to do that. I always thought I was doing therapy wrong the first time because I never cried, but when it needs to come it will"
TalkTherapy,erqixxh,t1_erq6vd4,1561144455.0,"Point taken. I wanted to try and go into a bit more of the specifics of my experience and felt more comfortable sharing that a bit more privately. I have no problem talking about my experiences to anyone who asks, but I donâ€™t necessarily want the details to be so public. Hope you understand"
TalkTherapy,erpz7i8,t1_erpf7yi,1561131474.0,Iâ€™ll dm you
TalkTherapy,erngpe5,t3_c2v3zo,1561052260.0,"It took me ages to cry in front of my T, in my first round of sessions I was also very detached from it all. When I did finally cry in front of her, it helped massively. It helped her to understand me better and it also helped me to know that I could let it out in front of her and not feel any judgement etc etc. For me a lot of the time I donâ€™t want to cry because I donâ€™t want to waste time in the session when we could be talking about things, but the other part of that is also being scared to be vulnerable in front of someone. Itâ€™s scary, but itâ€™s important. My T takes it as it comes, letâ€™s me cry, letâ€™s me finish talking and then acknowledges the pain that she can see and feel. That is so comforting."
