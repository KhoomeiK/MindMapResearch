beautytalkph,et1v8t6,t3_c9llm3,1562404644.0,"Dental student from UP Manila here. I cannot stress this enough: SPIT THE TOOTHPASTE, DON'T RINSE AFTER BRUSHING. 

This allows the fluoride in your toothpaste to be in contact with the tooth surface longer. Make sure the fluoride content in your toothpaste is 1000 to 1500 ppm. If my memory serves me right, Hapee has 1500 ppm. Check the label. 

How will you use mouthwash after brushing if you need the toothpaste to be in contact with your teeth? Make sure your mouthwash has fluoride, too. 

Also, gentle reminder to not brush from side to side as this abrades the teeth. 

I see that some comments here tell you to floss. Yes, that is very important to do but make sure you are doing it correctly. Do not make lagari or saw movements when flossing. Just put the floss in between teeth, let it embrace the tooth and then pull.

If you keep seeing blood after brushing, that means your gum is inflamed. Inflammation means there is infection = bacteria. This is called gingivitis. It's a sign to go to your dentist to have your cleaning done. Sometimes there are deposits that brushing alone cannot remove. These deposits are mineralized plaque also known as calculus or tartar. Lagi namang may plaque na nagfoform sa bibig natin. It is normal. When plaque is left undisturbed (meaning, hindi natamaan ng toothbrush) for a while, it mineralizes and becomes tartar. This may lodge in between gums, and cause inflammation. If left untreated, this inflammation may cause destruction, and may lead to periodontitis. Signs of periodontitis are when the attachment of the tooth to the gum is lost and bone resorbs. Teeth involved may then start to move and eventually lead to tooth loss. I don't think a lot of people know this, but caries or pagkasira ng ngipin isn't the only reason ng tooth loss. Gotta keep those gums healthy, too!"
