You say you are staying for your daughter but she is in such impressionable years. She will learn lessons from how he treats you.

You would have the assurance that as a mother you had led by example.

You say that she is attached to him. She is still able to see him if you leave. She may end up having a more positive relationship than if she watches him treat you with disrespect and apathy."

I'm probably the weird one here but it doesnt bother me to think of an animal eating a corpse or even my corpse. I love my cat but if I'm dead and they are locked inside with no food... go for gold. They are carnivores with a supply of meat that could help them survive. Why would they be expected to refuse that? I mean... humans have proved in many cases that we can't. Additionally the smell of a dead person would send a completely different set of signals to an animal. How they would perceive you would change completely when your smell is replaced with the smell of rotting meat."

sugarfreemua,fg8gulr,t3_ewwbgi,1580619084.0,"I think the foundation is great. I think the only thing I'd recommend is testing some very subtle bronzer out. The color you have chosen is great because it is a lovely base but it also removed the feeling of depth from your face and also of warmth. Blush provides a shock of color but it doesnt give depth to the features. The key is to use it subtly so that it isn't obvious to the casual viewer. Here is an [example](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7_2YZ5FW-f/?igshid=u9eimc8na3u0) of what I am referring to. As you can see, she has a glow of health but her original skin tone is still visible."
sugarfreemua,fg8fqc2,t3_ewuc6u,1580618148.0,"You are naturally so gorgeous so you dont want to cover that up by any means. I'd recommend trying to get some more structure to your eyebrows. Structured eyebrows can do wonders for framing your face and popping your eyes. Ditch the eye liner under the eyes and focus on brown eyeliner that isn't as obvious and severe on the upper lid. Some light dusting of highlighter on the high points of your cheek and under your brow can also add a depth to your face.

It's hard because I just got married so everyone wants to see my ring but I'm too nervous to show my hands.

AmItheAsshole,f5xjhcs,t3_dppc4p,1572541762.0,"YTA. It comes down to communication. If you suspected depression, ideally you would have talked about your feelings previously and why a wedding isn't ideal (even if you have proceeded with planning it). From the way you are writing, this sounds like a quick decision that has surprised her. I think if you had communicated this decision properly and your current mindset, she likely wouldn't be as upset with you.

At least that is my experience with anxiety."
serialkillers,f4uvyb3,t1_f4qdosh,1571831038.0,Very good point and I definitely don't think that mental illness equals immoral or depraved by any means. I recognize that some could assume that by reading the post. My query was more so because the book I was reading did identify schizophrenia as one of the main contributing factors for the murders. Which naturally made me wonder if easing symptoms of schizophrenia could change their attitudes or beliefs to the extent that they could feel remorse for what they did. I think through reading these comments I am understanding that my perception of those with schizophrenia was wrong (about violent behavior e.g.) and that you can't just get rid of schizophrenia through drugs. So I think this has been a valuable discussion and I've personally learned a lot.
serialkillers,f4uvjsu,t1_f4sdatv,1571830620.0,"That is fascinating, particularly your ability to reflect and assess past behaviors through such a different perspective.

'Baker was charged with second-degree murder, but was found not criminally responsible for his actions because he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and hadn’t been taking his medications.'

Chris Summerville, who is with the Manitoba Schizophrenia Society, is on the other side of the debate.
Summerville regularly chats with Baker and has kept in close contact since the NCR decision came down.

“He continues to make excellent progress,” Summerville said Monday. “He’s doing as well as anyone I know with schizophrenia and I know that’s hard for many people in the public to understand.”

Summerville has been an outspoken supporter of Baker and his release for years.

He believes something McLean’s family has repeatedly argued: the number one thing keeping Baker in line isn’t medication — it’s guilt.

“[People like Baker] want to stay in the shadows because they realize what they did was horrible and wrong. Once the medications take effect and they come to realize what they did, they go into horrible despondency and despair.""'

It has so far been very interesting. Yet when it reached the part about Mullin it stopped quite abruptly after he was sentenced. The book explains in depth that he was classified as a mixed classification serial killer, the disorganized side emerging due to his schizophrenia. His delusions were very intense which, in my ignorance of the condition, I'd imagine are one factor that medication could ease? I understand that there isn't a quick fix or even a cure for many conditions but I thought it interesting that this wasnt covered at all in the book (so far!)."

And then when the retina is back in place they remove the little ball.
