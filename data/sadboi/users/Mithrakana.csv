-Stay away from NSAIDs. Take a multi if you can tolerate it.

-See if anyone you're tight with has some Zofran laying around, or hit an urgent care. Sometimes it takes the edge off.

-Make an appointment with your doctor to get referred to a pancreatic specialist. They may expect you to see a general GI first.

I have been hospitalized for pancreatitis 4 times in my life. Same, the ER checks my blood and the correct numbers aren't elevated. Once you're able, read some peer reviewed studies on pancreatitis. Your doctors will take you more seriously if you can be articulate about your experience and your questions. 

ERs are there to stop you from dying. They're going to do textbook stuff and send you packing if you're stable, even if you're not well.

EatingDisorders,fdmzhqv,t3_em7sh6,1578572444.0,"Specialised eating disorder therapy was a start, but I also have some rules on the fridge. DBT can teach you to access mindfulness in a stressful situation, and from there you find resources (like a list) to train yourself onto. It helps break through the strong impulse to cope via food.

It's a very slow process, and the BED tendency will probably never completely go away. But DBT arms you for war and teaches you new coping mechanisms.

If you don't have access to an ED therapist, there's a series of DBT workbooks out there. The materials are all similar in each workbook, just the context is a little different (anxiety, depression, etc). It's a great way to introduce yourself to those skills, buy one or find the PDF online. Maybe get a regular therapist to discuss your workbook experience with. Healing in a vacuum is hardddd.

Western medicine also wants you to dig deep and identify where the BED came from. I've found it  an effective tool to be aware of the lifelong conditioning that guided me to have this problem. Therapist helps with that component."

Kinda like how so many of us have been denied tubal ligation because we're ""too stupid to realize we'll surely want kids someday"", folks think the same and more should be done to those seeking transition.

These people experience an urgent, religion-driven imperative to tell people what they should or shouldn't want for their bodies. They seek to have it enforced because they are fundamentalist, and certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that the religious beliefs they've been taught are the only truth.

I just want to chime in and say: You are allowed to decide for yourself how you feel about drag, and anything else. You don't have to subscribe 100% to any one line of thinking.

I have been sussing these ideas out for myself actively for a few weeks now, and I'm definitely not all in on one camp or another. It's not a source of brownie points on Reddit or in purist communities, that's for sure. But I'd hate to see you feel like you have to come to A Certain Conclusion in order to be Right.

So yes, read and reflect on all of the things these people are saying, but bear in mind that your conclusions are your own. Don't surrender that right in order to feel accepted.

It follows to say, my opinion is not a popular one here - Drag doesn't offend me. I know folks who do it, and their gender identities run the gamut. Drag has a history of creating community for atypical people who feel marginalized and threatened.

I'd much rather folks be doing drag than storming my women's group and shaming me for being a biological woman. I do not feel mocked or threatened by drag. It isn't the KKK, and no, I don't think it can be equated to black face at all.

If you decide it's offensive to you, of course, that's fine. You certainly wouldn't be the only person who feels that way.

FYI - I'm not going to engage with debate about this, just voicing my opinion to OP. I've been called an ignorant misogynist so many times by both camps on this debate when my questions and ideas don't follow the party line, I'm retired from giving a shit about why you think my opinion is blasphemy."

relationships,f6wwgem,t3_dtdtd5,1573236440.0,"The statistics are drastically stacked against a couple who were each other's first. This has very little to do with you and a lot to do with human nature - we're certain we know what we want, it helps us feel secure as we go through our 20s.

I was my ex-husband's first everything. He insisted he knew what he wanted when he asked me to marry him. At the time, that was true for him (and for me.)

There's not a lot of blame to lay here - it's really unfortunate that it took following through with the wedding for this to happen. Sometimes we think once we hit an arbitrary milestone we've set for ourselves, things will feel different.

I'm so, so glad you didn't have children. I've known people whose parents stayed together in self-denial of their own happiness until kids broke the lie. 

I'm sorry for this heartbreak. But it's growth for both of you.

You just lost what you thought was your game plan for the rest of your life - please get grief counseling, it's so important."

I hear you repeatedly saying you want to be polite. You're young, you're gentle. I am not blaming you for drawing this predatory creep's attention. But I want to point out that there's some learning here - 

There's more than one way to be polite. It is important as a woman that you understand, tolerating discomfort for the sake of others is NOT a sustainable way to live. It is important that you understand it is not inherently rude or bad to say ""No."" It is okay to say, ""I just told you I can pay for myself, and you ignored me and paid for my meal. That's rude and condescending, and I don't appreciate it."" 

It's okay to openly dislike someone, it's okay to decline a gift, it's okay to reject advances. NONE of these things are rude. Speaking your truth is not rude.

Please, take this opportunity to redefine polite for yourself, or your 20s are gonna suckkkk darlin'!!!

Also be prepared to need a restraining order if this guy works where you work. If he's blowing you up like this after you've said no, ugh. When this post is over, whatever happens in this situation, TAKE YOUR FEAR AND DISCOMFORT SERIOUSLY. If he starts showing up at work harassing you, if he's still blowing you up, please file a police report, inform work security, and file a restraining order so you have some semblance of legal recourse.

In college a girl I knew got beat to hell by a guy who ""seemed harmless and just couldn't take a hint"".

And, and - I know he's in your friend group. YO'. If they don't group dump his ass for this, they aren't your friends. If they tell you you're overreacting, they aren't your friends. If they say ""Aw he's harmless you should be nice"", ""why are you being such a bitch"", or anything like that, these people are toxic motherfuckers and you need them OUT of your life.

How a real friend would react: Anger. Encouraging you to distance yourself and avoid contact. Offering support. Encouraging you to report this behavior. Telling you he's a terrible scumbag and you don't deserve this. Reflecting on what happened to cause this mess and what can be learned from it. Making jokes about murdering him. Etc."

I am so sorry. Having a partner is supposed to make finances easier, not drain you for a year and then throw you out in the street. This situation is going to require so much change.

Can your teenager(s) go live with their other parent, or no? How soon will they be old enough to start supporting themselves? Are they old enough yet to work part time?

Don't be shy about going on government benefits. Start the application now, and aggressively call the customer service number every week to check the status of your application. 

See if there's a local women's support group of some kind and contact them to find out about resources for women in dire situations - you never know what's out there if you don't look.

Maybe make an abbreviated post on legal advice and figure out the nitty gritty of if you're common law married, what that means, if you can take this guy to court and secure some modest form of asset from the split.

God I'm so sorry."
