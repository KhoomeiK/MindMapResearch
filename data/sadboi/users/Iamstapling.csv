MasterchefAU,fqx63gx,t3_glchhn,1589726635.0,"Tbh, I am also annoyed with the constant Laura pasta thing, I don't care for it. 
But if someone then tells me ""what about this person with their thing"", then yes, I mean them too. Yes also the curry, and the noodles, and the dumplings, and the desserts. 

And I love being annoyed at these things. Take a drink every time they say fking Hibachi, shout at the tv in the absence of sports, pausing the stream to make bets and guesses on dishes and winners. Let the woman make her damn pasta, we all know Jock is gonna love it, we all know many of us hate it, it's all the same anyway."
MasterchefAU,fqmh1iz,t3_gjivdy,1589477318.0,"So interesting to see how much of a difference of reactions there are to this one

Personally, loved the reaction to Katy walking in. After that I kind of lost interest and skipped through a lot of it. She was a lot, and there was a lot of screaming. It all feels in contrast to why I personally enjoy watching Masterchef Australia. But I also understand why a lot of people would enjoy this :)"
MasterchefAU,fqeav8c,t1_fqdfou8,1589304548.0,"It's interesting though that in the discussion thread for today's episode, a lot more people say they dislike the twists!"
MasterchefAU,fqe9lwu,t3_gi7wpo,1589303983.0,"These twists are kind of sucking the joy out of Masterchef for me. I only watch the Australian version of Masterchef, mainly because it's pure and fun and just exciting enough.
Pressure tests and service challenges were already stressful, and.. I don't know, it's a lot for me xD"
MasterchefAU,fqagyi7,t3_ghkbtn,1589218897.0,"I was trying to see if anyone here wasn't a big fan of the twists, it was simply too much for my taste. But it seems it's just me :p
I am very curious about the coming week!"

BPD,ex1tcxa,t3_cr4ynm,1565955381.0,"I’ve honestly been thinking of trying it. Last time i tried was over 10 years ago and it made me paranoid/throw up, so haven’t tried it since. If you have any tips, please let me know!"
BPD,ewy71d6,t3_cqge7g,1565875979.0,"I’ve told prospective suitors all my crazy pretty upfront. At the moment I felt comfortable while hanging out, i would say: this is what you’re getting into.
And sometimes they’d leave, and sometimes they’d stay. It can definitely be painful, especially after rejection, so make sure you alert your safety net before staring this conversation. But it is far less painful than after investing a lot of time and feelings into someone.
Just have people who know you are having the conversation. To support you when it doesn’t work out or celebrate with you when it does."
BPD,ewy4yz2,t3_cqi16d,1565874828.0,"I honestly try and narrate it out loud. “I’m having a really hard time making this decision”. 
If there are more than 2 options, i take 2 small pieces that appeal to me, ignoring the existence of all the other options, and then relay that choice to people who are there. 
Also, i have 2 people in my life that know how much i suck at making decisions and sometimes i just text them out of the blue about a choice that is making me dry heave. 
But mostly i try to not beat myself up about the decision i end up making. I try to realize and remember that you can’t change the past, and “missing out” doesn’t exist. Things happen as they happen. The other timeline doesn’t exist.

I mean, i’m still very stagnant in my ‘big-picture-life’ and struggle all the time, but actively trying not to dwell in could-have-been’s has proven to be helpful.

Good luck, and keep going :)"
BPD,ewkjl75,t3_ccjchq,1565486201.0,"Hell yes!  
This is why I don't really listen to music, or watch new shows, or read, anymore. Only when I feel secure enough about myself, and feel like I can enjoy the story as is, instead of absolutely absorbing the words.   


Sometimes when I binge watch a series, by the end of it I am too involved, and I can't watch the ending because I feel like I'm going to throw up because of the tension. Then I have to read a synopsis about it so that I'm not so anxious, then I can watch it. Just me?"
BPD,ewkh4n7,t3_cmff1b,1565484267.0,"DAE actively try to forget everything about their past?  
I have actively suppressed any dream or big goals, memories, and experiences, for about 10 years? Hoping it would just level me out I guess.   
I mean it doesn't help, but  I still do it."
