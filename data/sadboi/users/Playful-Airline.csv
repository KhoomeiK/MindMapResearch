Its my hobby and I have no intention of making it a profession. This is my work and I'm not ashamed of it one bit. Ofcourse I want to improve but I'm in no rush. I want to experiment more.

CPTSD,florlnp,t1_flopvv5,1585344052.0,Yeah the same happens to me. I feel like I am stuck somewhere back in 2012. I just don't feel my age. I am mostly still the same person it's just that I feel like I am stuck in that time period I just can't believe I am all grown up now. It's a bit shocking to me for some reason.

CPTSD,flak55t,t1_flajxk7,1584985471.0,One of them happened to be a Vietnam war veteran with ptsd himself. I just found their attitude very self righteous.
stories,flajwwn,t3_fnm3sh,1584985344.0,Good for you. There is no need to keep shitty people in your life. Surround yourself with positive people.
AskReddit,flajpa5,t3_fnnnfh,1584985227.0,"There was a protest going on near our school so we had to remain inside for a long time until our parents were allowed to pick us up. On my way back home I thought I wouldn't survive. Protestors were burning tyres, yelling and stopping cars that came in their way. Roads were blocked. I didn't think we would make it home. I was terrified the whole time. Actually thought they were gonna kill me."
CPTSD,fl9xv4o,t1_fl9w982,1584972095.0,There is no point in being sorry if you aren't going to change. Abusive people can't just stop being abusive by saying sorry. They have issues and need therapy but for that to happen they need to accept that something is wrong with them which they never do.
CPTSD,fl9xivq,t1_fl9a1eq,1584971853.0,Forgiveness should only be done when you are ready and for your own peace of mind if it helps you.
CPTSD,fl9xd1q,t1_fl9m76x,1584971739.0,Well to be honest it's hard to not let trauma define you when it is what actually made you.
CPTSD,fl9x4w9,t1_fl9sbye,1584971579.0,It's hard to ler go of your anger when you realize that a person you loved has treated you so horribly. Anger is justifiable in this case and even healthy. For me I know if I hadn't experiemced extreme anger towards my abusive ex I would have been sucked back into the relationshit. Anger helped me cut him out of my life.
CPTSD,fl9wall,t1_fl9shn2,1584970977.0,I'll give it a read. I think society is obsessed with forgiveness because it seems to be the morally right thing to do. But there is no point of forced forgiveness. If you don't feel ready to forgive then don't forgive. And that doesn't make you a bad person at all.
CPTSD,fl9w4ww,t1_fl9ti0l,1584970861.0,My mother said she was sorry for how she treated me. I wholeheartedly forgave her and was actually looking forward to a better relationship with her. She didn't change at all.
CPTSD,fl9w0se,t1_fl9vg4o,1584970776.0,I think you should forgive for your own sake and only if you are ready. You don't owe forgiveness to your abusive and neither are they deserving of it.
CPTSD,fl9erb3,t1_fl9egjb,1584952357.0,I already left lol.
LifeAfterNarcissism,fl96z5d,t1_fl90lcb,1584943201.0,He seems like a sociopath or a psychopath to me but he did have narcisstic traits too so I am not sure. He used to hurt me simply for his own entertainment. Like swearing at my family at 2 am was fun for him.

CPTSD,fl6fuuo,t1_fl6ej1s,1584866962.0,I think trying to take your control back is precisely the reason why children act out their abuse on other kids while playing.
CPTSD,fl68si0,t3_fmu154,1584858448.0,Yeah sometimes I hope I get it and just die. But then I wouldn't want to risk the possibility of unknowingly infecting others.
CPTSD,fl68qcg,t3_fmuw1m,1584858380.0,It seems like you are replaying the situation while you are asleep. I am not exactly sure but I read somewhere that it can be a way for victims of assault to cope with what happened and try to gain back their control.

CPTSD,fl5xzmy,t1_fl5xq5w,1584848690.0,Yeah that's totally understandable. The thing is that sometimes I end up responding to assholes in a very unethical manner myself. And in the end there is just no difference left between me and them.

CPTSD,fl5pwv1,t1_fl5mjnn,1584842712.0,Oh yes. I too try to actively hurt those who hurt me. I get this strong desire to get even with people.
LifeAfterNarcissism,fl4dfwi,t1_fl4aegd,1584811193.0,That is what I though too. This person did fit most of the traits of sociopathy.
ptsd,fl2o34k,t1_fl2nsal,1584755650.0,I am so sorry to hear that. Definitely the same seems to be the case with me. I got affected by this way more than a person normally would be. I was already displaying symptoms of trauma way before I met him when I was still being sexually abused. So perhaps this person just made everything worse for me.
ptsd,fl2n900,t1_fl2mqsb,1584755075.0,"I did experience a lot of childhood abuse/sexual assault and bullying before getting into this relationship so maybe everything bad that ever happened to me just came together and I snapped. I was already pretty damaged before this happened. To make everything worse, the breakup happened while I moved to a different country unexpectedly and that whole time was very shocking for me. I didn't talk to anyone, I had no friends I could share this with. It was just me dealing with the aftermath of what this person did all by myself."
ptsd,fl2mq26,t1_fl2m2nh,1584754716.0,Yeah I do feel awful calling it a trauma because it wasn't life threatening but what happened did give me all the symptoms of ptsd. And it just sucks to have all of that come back after I thought I was over it. I have already sought help and also got diagnosed. I was also abused in my childhood so that's also where the ptsd is coming from. But this person did permenantly damage me in many ways.
CPTSD,fl27vgp,t1_fl1c3k7,1584744907.0,Yeah that seems like what happened. It does feel like I got a bit dependant on a random stranger in just one conversation. He got the info he wanted and ghosted me.
canada,fl27quc,t1_fl27j9r,1584744826.0,Yeah front line cop is a big no for me. I wouldn't want to be a risk to others or myself. It's a huge responsibility to take and not everyone is fit for it.

canada,fl17dbh,t1_fl16jnr,1584723430.0,"That's fine and understandable.
 My post clearly says being a cop is not gonna happen but would like some suggestions if there are OTHER careers in the same field. Since that is what I study."
ptsd,fl16wlp,t1_fl14uqv,1584723170.0,Your trauma is valid. One of the symptoms of trauma is denial or minimizing what happened. Almost every person who goes through any trauma feels like their trauma isn't valid because other's had it worse. It doesn't matter how big or small a trauma is. All that matters is that you were affected by it and you are showing symptoms that are negatively affecting your daily life.
canada,fl15w3s,t1_fl15642,1584722609.0,I completely get that. I do think that I would like to have some peace in life rather than make things worse for myself. It's something I wanted to do since highschool but now I am not so sure about it.
Life,fl11hi6,t1_fl107lj,1584720143.0,"Kind of still stings a little that they couldn't figure out my worth even though they aren't really relevant anymore.
But someone told me one thing ; if you give a beggar a diamond he'll either throw it away or exchange it for a better bowl. The diamond doesn't looses its wortth. It's the beggar's loss which he isn't even aware of.

canada,fl0i130,t1_fl0hjur,1584707067.0,"My doctor told me they get a lot of cop patients who struggle with mental health issues. So I do realize it's a very tough job. Mental health in general has been very stigmatized in the past. It must be even harder for law enforcement officers because they are supposed to be tough and mental illness can be wrongly seen as a sign of weakness. It's good to see that slowly people's mentality towards mental illness is changing.

It may or may not be for me. I might not even get in who knows. That only time will tell.

CPTSD,fl0gq1x,t1_fl0gj0u,1584705846.0,I couldn't see if he was online but I did sent him a text saying hi to which he didn't respond.
