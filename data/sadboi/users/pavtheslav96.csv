BPD,fj6agk2,t3_fbinu1,1583064689.0,I'm 23 and this post and the comments got me a bit worried. I was hoping that that feeling would go away in my late 20s/early 30s. Now I feel like it mostly intensifies it. :/

BPD,fcy3lhw,t3_efgqu7,1578074323.0,"To be honest, I've not felt 'home' in many years. Sometimes I feel like my soul just got lost somewhere in the universe and it's trying to find it's way back to my body. And I really just want to go home. 
Or I'm just high, idk."
AmItheAsshole,fb646o4,t3_ebjcyh,1576540946.0,"NTA. My family would get me and my *cousin* the same brand of crisps, so that no one would feel left out. You're in your right to feel bad about it. But another thing to consider is if he needs the car more (studying further away, having a job, etc). I hope you guys sort it out tho, your dad seems to feel regretful about it."
Drugs,fb63odx,t1_fb5sej0,1576540586.0,"My biggest issue is if I receive them at all, I'll definitely take 1/3 of a pill at first to test what it actually is, if I do get them. I've been on Xanax before (needed to take them almost daily), so I'd hope that I know how much to take so that my body doesn't get used to it. I usually don't use it recreationally, only during panic attacks. 
Nonetheless, thank you for your response and advice!"
RoastMe,fb5nwij,t3_ebaqf3,1576531086.0,You have a charming smile. Too bad you try too hard to impress the wrong type of people.
Drugs,fb5mc8a,t3_ebl048,1576530260.0,"I'd always recommend taking  bit by bit and seeing what amount works for you. It's always up to what your body can take/would like to take. If you want to have a good time, you first need to do smaller amounts at a time, so that you know what your tolerance is at that point in time. Tolerance can change according to your mental state/food intake that day/your weight at the time and/or metabolism. 
Always be careful with drugs, they can always help you out, but they have a HUGE potential to do some damage (including short-term). And if you're unsure, it always helps to have a sober(ish) friend around that can help out.

Hope this helps! Remember to just have fun and  the safe ‚ù§"
Drugs,fb5kef0,t1_fb5j40o,1576529267.0,"Basically medication is less regulated in some countries (e.g. I'm from Bulgaria and it's easier for me to get medication there than it is in the UK). The problem is that I no longer have health insurance back home, as it's been transferred to the UK. I've had friends buy things like that online to get over the whole document issues/fees and all, but I'm just a bit concerned, as I'm poor af, but in a really bad place right now, where I just need to chill tf out and my stupid propanolol hasn't been doing shite for my panic attacks. I definitely wouldn't recommend it if I wasn't desperate for not flippling out and throwing myself off my 14 story apartment building. 

Cameroon has even lower standards than Bulgaria, so I put my trust in that guy, as I'm very desperate."

P.S. Was very sui**dal tonight, thank you for this post. Made me see that people have bigger issues than me. Godspeed and good luck with your penis! 
P.P.S. size definitely doesn't matter, best s*x I've had has been with someone who's penis was smaller than average."
relationship_advice,falw8ga,t3_dwmlki,1576191532.0,"I've been in similar situations before, it's to put you down. I'd say he's a very insecure boy and he's trying to bring you down, so that you'd rely on him more, he KNOWS you can do better and is trying to make sure you don't figure it out. Basically negging with extra steps. Drop his ass!"
AmItheAsshole,fala8im,t3_e9nc1x,1576180989.0,"NTA. I grew up in a very abusive household, my mom made my life a living hell and my dad always backed her up, so that she wouldn't get into a fight with him as well. Now all of my relationships are ruined because I'm too scared to get attached to anyone, because I've been told no one would want to marry me because of what a horrible personality I have. To be honest, I'm happy to hear that your parents realized they've messed you up, I feel like their acknowledgement could help you see that it's nothing in your control."
