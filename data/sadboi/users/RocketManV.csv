I highly suggest getting into biking, it has been years since I was first on Risperdal and I still bike fervently for many reasons, one of them chiefly mental health. 

If you have any other questions, please do feel free to ask."

I also did make a couple blunders my last two dungeons, going into a shambler fight (lost two) and going into the Siren already very stressed out (lost four).

I'm also watching a Stygian run and noticing that he almost never takes damage increasing trinkets, whereas I just about always do, sometimes double over, and I'm running into problems now that I'm to Champion dungeons.

Are there any specific hints or suggestions you can think of for the jump to champion level dungeons? The new enemies are so much more difficult, and everyone hits so much harder it seems."
