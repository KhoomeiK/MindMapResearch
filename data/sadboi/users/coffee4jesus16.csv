Gastroparesis,fi5xoso,t1_fi5be44,1582173017.0,"If you have any favorite recipes, I’d love to have them! I find most processed white carbs hurt me so I’ve discovered millet and quinoa, but those only do so much."
Gastroparesis,fi50s51,t3_f6h4n8,1582152432.0,"I have only heard negative things about going plant based (not from doctors, just from the GP online community in general). 

I’d love to hear of good experiences! I hear tofu is a great protein for GP stomachs. Dairy often exacerbates symptoms so that’s easy to drop. If you cook things down, I can see it working. Quinoa and millet are supposedly GP safe-ish, so it’s not like you have to stick to white processed carbs. Nondairy milks can hold a lot of protein. Vegan shakes like Orgain aren’t half bad. 

I bet it could work!"

I figure I might as well go see the Mormon stuff in Nauvoo since I grew up Mormon, but if I’m going to drive two hours, I want to make it worth it and saw there’s the state park. The trails look short but I’m not sure. 

 Matthiessen and Starved Rock sounds great though. I’ll definitely look into spikes and better boots."

Sometimes I get them on the weekend. My mother was visiting from far out of state and I ended up having to have one. So I guess it makes some sense but ya.... does a semi-tradition work schedule kill any chance for them because I fucking need them lately."

I should mention I’m awful about keeping up with appointments due to my work schedule and moved in the middle of my diagnosis and haven’t seen a GI specialist more than once since moving so that could be totally normal and I’ve missed it."
