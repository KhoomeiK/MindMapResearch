I do take off random days off but I feel like I have to take at least 5 business days together to really get some detox out, preferably 10. If you do not have enough PTO saved up just tell them you need un paid time off for personal reasons, sounds like you are too valuable to be fired anyways so they won't say no. Good luck and do not forget that there are more jobs than developers :) Mobile devs are always needed so I would not be afraid to make the jump."

AskReddit,f463he9,t1_f462cje,1571403538.0,"This message literally just got my eyes tearing... THANK YOU!!!! SO MUCH!!! You gave me a hope that its possible to get through this nonsense... With the therapy though, I have tried 2 different therapists (maybe need to try another) and I feel like I do not get much out of it because I always feel as they concentrate on things that do not affect me. (For instance, I grew up without a dad and for therapists thats a red flag but in reality it has absolutely no affect on my. My mom was super strong to be dad and mom both..) So I always feel the need that I have to at least TRY to understand over all the reason of my feelings so that I can lead my therapist to possibly the right decision for them to help me. Almost as I have to pre-diagnose myself before they can actually diagnose me."
AskReddit,f462m91,t1_f4611q1,1571403192.0,"Which meds are you on? I was taking Buspirone while I was experiencing heavy anxiety attacks and I can relate to what you feel. I felt like I was okay with the way I was because I did not really care much to analyze my actions. I was only taking 10mg which is really low from what I have heard but I only took it for 2 months and got myself off to try other alternatives. I spent about 3-4 months listening to my body and actions to find what caused it, what helped it, etc and forced myself to become an expert in a way (expert in relation to my own self's body/mind when it comes to anxieties). I still have them here and there but usually I can see them coming way before they get to that ""panic"" mode and stop them."
AskReddit,f4614yk,t1_f45zmhl,1571402585.0,"Is it possible to fight it without medication? I just went through dealing with anxieties (overcame some time ago) and back then I was taking Buspirone for it. Although that medicine did not make me feel too bad as it was only 10mg doze, I felt as it slew my life down by giving my brain ""eh whatever I don't care"" feeling. Before If I would do like 5 things during the day, while on that medicine I would do 1-2 and I would be ""okay"" with it because I did not really care. Does Antidepressants give that same ""don't care"" feeling? Or will they actually give me energy and excitement during my daily activities?"

AskReddit,f46075w,t1_f45zmwj,1571402081.0,That is very interesting. I just overcame anxiety crap actually and for me dealing with anxiety was easier because I was able to identify what triggered it and what actions I could take to slow it down if not stop it. With depression I have no idea why I even feel this way or what to do to help it.
AskReddit,f45zx6b,t1_f45ywcc,1571401833.0,"I did try CBD but I feel like CBD, if anything, brought me down even more. It made me lazy and strengthen my depression because I was aware of my laziness."
AskReddit,f45zq5d,t1_f45ytp5,1571401656.0,"Sorry about typo. Honestly I have not allowed myself to accept the fact that I am suffering w/ depression until recently. In past year I felt as nothing was making me happy. I decided it was probably because I was not happy with lifestyle I was living so decided to change it. Erased alcohol from life, started to going to gym more, started training for MMA, started rock climbing, made new friends, got a new job, traveled a lot, started reading, started meditating (probably forgetting few) but nothing has made me happy. I get home from work and sometimes I just ball out crying and I have no idea why. I try to sit down and figure out what is going on but nothing comes in mind that is concrete that I know of. Some days I am ""ok"" and can get on with my day, others I am miserable in the sense that I am completely down. I have an extremely successful career and loving family so from outside view my life should be so beautiful and awesome but it is so depressing inside.

Exercising, socializing, traveling, meditating, new hobbies, new friends, close family relationships, you name it I have probably tried it. I no longer go to therapist because everything she tells me I feel like I have already told myself. Nothing is working but I am not loosing hope.. I am not giving in on the fact that this may one day just be part of me. I will keep fighting, I hope that everyone out there does the same. It has got to be curable ."

utdallas,f2vpfz0,t1_f2v2sqw,1570455722.0,"It was definitely tough, I had to try out few different things to make it work. I remember I had the table of grades and their respective weights all written out on the first page of a notebook for a given class (I’ll try finding it and share it at some point). This helped me prioritize exams based on where I was lacking. So for example if in class1 I had all A in homework’s and projects and their weights was 60% of the class then I would spend my main time studying for classes exam for which the exam weight was higher. 

The big reason why we feel overwhelmed and anxious because we try to analyze what’s in front of us and do jt all. So for me, I tried to focus on the items that needed attention right away instead of the whole/half semester worth of projects/homework’s. That way you are minimizing the stress that may not be necessarily right away.  

It definitely does get better!!! Honestly the day I walked on the stage I felt the biggest relief. I am now contemplating on going back for masters but I took 1 year off to enjoy the freedom. So yes, hang in there! It will get better!! 😊"

videos,f1q34y5,t1_f1q1p2e,1569692642.0,"Yes school did teach my about recursive functions but I had to reteach that to myself because when I was in school they didn’t really explain me how or when I would need to apply it in real life. Knowing how recursion functions work alone is not sufficient. Like Einstein’s relativity theorem, nothing makes sense without specifying what you are speaking in relation of. And school does not give you much relation from abstract to concrete. You get out of school knowing bunch of random information but by the time you get to experience different problems in career to be able to actually understand when and how you should apply those skills you learned, you had forgotten and need to re learn.  

So over all I am not saying school is worthless. It taught me problem solving skills and now I can learn new skills or solve engineering problems significantly faster compared to if I hadn’t gone to school but for the price school costs (I am in US, relative average school. Not Ivy League school) you could invest that amount of money to self teach and get more out of it."

Maybe some industries are different (like medical, I probably would hope my doctor went to school instead of learning from trial/error) but for sure software engineering you can either code or can’t.
