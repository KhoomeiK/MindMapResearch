lonely,fn99u9y,t3_g06w3b,1586764647.0,"I know that this seems like a whisper in the crowd at this point (it's ironic that so many people feel the same way and yet somehow we're still just as lonely). I understand what you feel. It doesn't help when you see people around you being in relationships and seemingly enjoying themselves. This used to cause me a lot of distress and sadness. I have experienced a lot of self-doubt and it lead me to develop a very poor self-image. I suffer from depression as well, so it's a pathetic situation essentially.

However, these past few months (since the beginning of this year) I have been trying to make peace with my situation. I spent my entire life trying to get out of the country I was born in so that I will have my own life and I will get to meet people and have opportunities. When I got here, I tried to put myself out there and I was disappointed (no surprises there). It's hard not to blame yourself at that point. But this January, I decided that there is no point trying to wait around for something that may or may not happen and feeling bad or impatient. I tried to imagine what my life would be like, say, 15 years from now. Assuming things remain as it is, I will be alone. But the more I try to stick to the reality and not be bogged down by the fact that I don't have someone in my life in that capacity, the more I realise that I think I'll turn out fine. I've been fine all this while. So why should it change?

It's helped me for these few months at least. I hope you find something that helps you too. Need not be the same as me but something that'll let you feel better."

askgaybros,fmi1998,t3_fv9arg,1586100212.0,"I wish I had a boyfriend like that tbh. I think he might be on the asexual spectrum (I think I am too). But what matters is if being with him is enough for you. Because if he really does like/love you, then he wouldn't want to hold you back from what you truly want; and if sex is something that is important to you in a relationship, then you deserve to have that in your life. 

The reason I say this is because I know a few couples (straight) where one person seemed to have a higher sex drive than the other and because they liked the person and didn't want to break up, they looked for sex elsewhere without letting the other person know (which I believe is unfair; the not letting them know part. If they'd wanted to open up the relationship, they should have been up front about it).

Nevertheless, if you truly feel that you are ready to compromise on having more sex in order to be with your boyfriend, then don't let this hold you back. In relationships, compromises are okay but sacrifices are usually not, because it might lead to resentment and bitterness.

One other thing is that open and honest communication rarely fails. If you feel like he doesn't enjoy sex and is doing it only for your sake, ask him. Talking to him about this might actually change your perspective about the whole thing."
