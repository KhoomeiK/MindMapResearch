Was there a better way to expose Osborn?

Ok I get it now. Someone being in control of crime doesn’t justify anything because they are still responsible for organizied crime and people fight for their position. Isn’t that why fisk became the Kingpin?

And sure to inspire people to make sacrifices is nice but it is still brutal but imho when thinking back to what GG told Spider-Man on the rooftop in Spider-Man 1 “Inspite Of everything you done for them they will hate you” or what Joker told Batman in the interrogation scene in The Dark Knight “They need you right now but when they don’t they will cast you out, their morals, their code, its a bad joke, dropped at the first sign of trouble, you see there only as good as the world allows them to be...” ya hard to make the self-sacrifice. And telling me to get help for having an opinion about society and people ain’t gonna Cut it. Sorry people suck, and nobody cares about each other anymore in my opinion. And there are so many examples from the real world and Art(which society says reflects life) about just how awful people are and how good efforts don’t justify it and people who say that there is more good in the world and people are awesome are either naive , narrow-minded, or biased towards evil and want evil to prosper and not be exposed"
