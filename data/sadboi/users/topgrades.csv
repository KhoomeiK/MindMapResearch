However, keep in mind that not all rapes are reported. To be raped is just as bad as being murdered, allthough people live through it and many can get their lives back with good help. Low numbers of rape can also be explained by so many women taking all these precautions: not running at evening or alone and staying in trusted areas, not with music/loud music, not with their hair easily tugged or loose items used for strangling etc... 

Getting cat called and similar experience are also bad enough and can really put a strain to your mental health. I wish people would recognise this. Mental abuse it also physical abuse. If you've ever seen someone being abused by words you can almost see how their body crouches down as if they are being physically hit and I can tell you: you don't get a bruise but to some extent it feels pretty similar."

The story is not drunk on stereotypes about women. She's fragile, broken and strong at the same time and she's not just a woman she is A PERSON.

Also I'm reading Edward St. Aubyn's books about Patrick Melrose(just began book 2). They are brutal, but when it comes to the female gallery they are kind of refreshing and quirky so far.

Patti Smith's self biographies are solid. Artsy and she loves people but she's also a woman on her own. I would guess there are more self biographies by female artists/musicians worth a look. Often I prefer history to novels, because some things you can't really make up and people are usually more complete that flat characters in novels designed to make critics and cultural pastiche elites happy.

Norwegian author Ingvild RiishÃ¸y is a devil at writing novellas. She reminds me of Tove Jansson(author of moomin and several novels) who was refreshing and breaking norms herself, and I think that shines through her works.

It's been so difficult to try calorie counting, because in the end I've eaten so many small different ingredients it's hard to keep track or I've just ended over restricting. Or ""messing up"" and then just eating it all because the day was ruined anyhow.

This year I tried intermittent fasting, eating like I usually do, but just from 12-18 instead (16:8 style). I started out slow, eating if I was really hungry. But doing this taught me that it wasn't a last chance, but also that it's almost IMPOSSIBLE to truly starve. You'd have to stop eating for many many days! Fasting up to 48 hrs can actually be beneficial. So that really helped on the mindset I grew up with (don't know when next meal is gonna be, you might STARVE).

explainlikeimfive,fm4au0z,t1_fm0gnls,1585750417.0,"It's pretty weird, the whole fight in the food industry (I guess it's a fight in any industry but oh well). Just annoys me that you can still call products without avocado ""guacamole"" or pistachio nuts ""pistachio ice-cream"". Hmm or wait, maybe you actually have to add 10% of what you're pretending it is made up of. Thus I can see why banning plant options from classical names for animal product. Oh well, crazy anyhow! If you don't wanna eat vegan because of animals or health, do it against the big capitalism."
explainlikeimfive,fm03ofb,t1_flzzcoe,1585643440.0,"Yeah! There's a reason plant-milk producers aren't really allowed to call their stuff ""milk"", but ""oat drink"" and I honestly don't think it's about true labeling of foods... The dairy industry is right up there with big pharma and the Coke/pepsi war. It's interesting that it seems even stronger than the meat industry, because people are still allowed to name stuff ""plant burger"" or ""soy sausage""."
fasting,flzqica,t1_flz78hj,1585630513.0,"Thanks, there is hope for everyone! I don't know how long you'd like to be fasting, but I'm doing the 16:8 now and it really seems to work long-term because you won't have to explain yourself to people around you, and I find that it kind of stabilized my bored eating. What worked for me in the past has generally been focusing on what I should eat more of, like vegetables and frozen fruit (yum!), and drinking enough water. 5 servings fruits/greens a day is harder that it seems! I've been in the boredom-pit and giving-up pit so many times when I lived at home. It's a bit of a prison feeling, but you will manage to break free at some point."
intermittentfasting,flzq1nl,t1_flz8kw7,1585630133.0,"I should try counting one or two days just to check, but I think in general I eat a lot less, meaning it doesn't matter that much if I do have sugar cravings. IF has made my mind much much less stressed and it feels like I'm slowly getting into my natural rythm of eating and having an apetite! I'm so happy to hear it works for you as well! I don't see any changes yet, but I feel more comfortable (no bellyaching haha) and content."
fasting,flxby6o,t3_frpq38,1585579818.0,"My mother really fucked up my relationship with food. I didn't really learn that processed food was something you should eat less of (with nutritious food/mostly unprocessed you can basically unlimited amounts without turning unhealthy).

She'd bake sweet goods and then blame me if I didn't want to eat it. As if I was mean because I didn't feel like eating cake, though she never asked me in advance.

I would get cross examined if I didn't have two portions of dinner, even when I would feel stuffed from one portion.

I wish I could go back in time, asking her if I was the one to be cruel or if it was more cruel to hurt your child with unhealthy eating patterns. Overeating is just as bad as anorexia and other eating disorders. I wish I'd gotten help from someone outside the family. Intermittent fasting is the only thing that has helped me getting my natural balance back. Not forcing myself to eat the plate clean or feeling like something bad is gonna happen if I skip dinner when I'm not hungry. Learning to recognise what healthy appetite is. 

TLDR: Hang in there! Nothing unusual about 16 hour fasts when humans naturally can thrive with 24-hr fasts, and that such shorter periods actually have scientifically proven benefits in the long run. Just make sure you get your basic nutrition and enough water."

mentalhealth,flx99z1,t1_fluf96u,1585578171.0,"I love this honesty! I didn't really use Reddit when I was younger, but I wish I did and the older I get the more Reddit somehow feels like the family with no strings attached. Never seen a place where people are honestly hoping for other people to succeed, rooting for each other, even with people you dislike. I used Facebook, then I quit, I used Instagram, and now I rarely open it anymore: I'm so sick of the brave-facing look at me shit. And Twitter might be the worst place, depending on who you follow. 

I actually like being the first one to reply to posts. It feels more like a one-on-one convo, so don't be scared leaving it there. Sometimes I even find really old posts and I'll respond to it. If only for the op to look back on how far they've come."
Focusrite,fl214cx,t3_fm24rk,1584740603.0,"Bump! I have a similar problem: I use focusrite 2i4 and Ableton, and I have a USB gamingheadset. Haven't done music in ages, but I'm starting up again while we're all in corona lockdown. I guess I could try messing around with the Asio driver or someting, but it seems difficult to set input to focusrite and output to the usb headset."
intermittentfasting,fkqxgvr,t1_fkqx7cy,1584457648.0,And NB: STAY HYDRATED. Drink 3 litres of water each day (but no more to avoid flushing out nutrients). Focusing on drinking water can help you redirect attention to food.
intermittentfasting,fkqx7cy,t3_fk480l,1584457486.0,"Same! But my apartment has never been shinier! I tend to let small piles of mess annoy me, so it's great to get it over with: one small room/are a day to clean/declutter, keep the binging away. I usually do it in the morning and it throws me into a productive mood. It can be difficult, as I can't go anywhere to rid myself of dangerous/bigger garbage, but at least my windows can look nice.

I've also picked up creative hobbies again, such as music, sewing and writing. Maybe it's time to find a new creative hobby to take you mind of things? It can be writing a diary even: we tend to lack the time for it in our daily life without the lockdown. I'm lucky though, I still have a pile of books, films and games to experience as well.

Make some new routines to keep you going: keep waking at the same time each day, call a friend, morning shower, morning walk if possible or yoga, brush your teeth, read one chapter in a book, make that thermos of coffee, declutter that one area (kitchen drawer, bathroom cabinet etc), find a webpage with a daily quote, try Duolingo to learn a new language etc. I'm so grateful I keep checking in with a friend each day, and we each swear to one goal, like ""listening to two episodes of that podcast, doing that one workout video on YouTube"".

You're not alone, see if you can find a friend or someone here to check in with! A habit-buddy!"

In the long run, visualizing your career and skills in numbers (I worked one year supporting X students and X lecturers, I was part responsible for a collection of X materials, of which X digitally archived blah blah) can be a really good card up your sleeve. Visualizing skills at any point will probably come in handy, because you can make examples of how you would promote services and add them in a portfolio as a supplement to your CV."

I guess all directions could be relevant, but I notice I've had just as much use of a creative writing/design background as my areas of study. These days I wish I had more of archival knowledge because it might help us solve issues with our catalogue data."
