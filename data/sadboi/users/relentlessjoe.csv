Overwatch,fq7wmsa,t3_gh9lyd,1589153720.0,"That’s precisely my issue with playing comp. I honestly don’t care too much about my rank, I just want to have some slightly more serious games. I give it my all and analyze my plays, I try to move ahead. 

That being said, it bothers that games are either too easy or too hard. That’s not fun.

Because of this I’ve stopped playing competitive almost entirely and play QP or arcade. Competitive is just not as fun and feels like a waste of time. 

Mainly cause the queues are longer, people tend to tilt and quit more often, and there’s no backfill (with good reason of course). Not to mention the utter toxicity. Hell, even QP has toxicity but ranked is worse."

French,fp2t0ba,t3_gawc15,1588267392.0,"It does, and it’s a result of dropping “e”.  Not just any “e” but the “e” in “je”, “te”, “de”, etc. 

When this happens, the consonants can change to better flow with the following consonant. 

Usually this means that, phonetically, je suis becomes chui.

That being said, when the consonant that follows is one that vibrates your vocal cords, the preceding consonant will also turn into one that vibrates tour cords. 

Examples: 

Je vais - j’vais - a j sound instead of a ch sound. 
Médecin - metcin - you drop the second e, the s doesn’t vibrate your cords so d turns more into a t sound. 

Pay attention to when and where people drop « e » in French. It’s key to understanding native speakers."

AskGaybrosOver30,fhsjsos,t3_f4nk53,1581861813.0,"I hate losing a friend :( people in the comments might get all judgmental but I think you guys simply played with boundaries and were obviously inebriated. I don’t think you should be ashamed of what you did (not saying you are btw, more for the other commentators). 

Thing is, boundaries are there to be pushed a bit when you’re trying to get close to someone. That’s literally what we do all the time with everyone. You guys opened up to each other and he obviously trusted you. And of course alcohol and drugs played a role. We can get all worked up by the fact that it’s sex, but for some people even over sharing can cross a line and things become weird. It’s just an attempt at being more intimate and fulfilling a desire. Just cause it was sexual doesn’t mean that we have to get so worked up about it. 

It’s possible that he might be more aware of how drugs and alcohol could lead to losing control, so even if being sexually with you wasn’t the end of the world for him, doing something like what he did might actually scare him now and you remind him of that. It’s unfortunate, but it happens, and has to do more with him than with you. 

Again, I’m sorry for your potential loss of a close friend. It’s very painful, but it’s not all on you (I don’t get why people get so judgmental), it’s on him too. Who knows, maybe you guys might reconnect after when the dust has settled. I do also advise you get your head out of this situation and distract yourself. Socialize with others or just engage with something. I’m saying this mostly because of what you said about anxiety, and this really seems to be weighing on your mind.

CBD,fdkbr7q,t3_elsu4b,1578500522.0,"Panic attacks are a complicated beast. There’s just so many variables.

As someone that suffered from anxiety and panic attacks, I get it. Yes, they can be “self-induced” (I personally don’t like the term because the person has a legit condition, it’s not like they decided to make the decision to panic themselves. It’s a symptom of a greater problem, it’s unfair to say it’s the person’s fault).  If you have panic attack disorder, you’re hyper aware of your own bodily sensations. It gets to the point that even a neutral or even positive change might trigger fear and “what if” thoughts. 

This is to say that even when it goes positively, CBD (or other substances) can trigger a panic attack given the right circumstances.

My advice to people with anxiety disorders, start with something with little to no THC, and start low. Second, be open to feeling differently. Third, educate yourself about what to expect. You’re not going to get high, you’re not going to get more anxious. If you do, it’s most likely your anxious mind. Being afraid of getting a panic attack is part of what keeps you in the panic trap. As long as you’re being careful, it’s okay to “take the risk,” so to speak. Long term relief for anxiety is worth more than a single panic attack.

If you do this, you’ll slowly begin to trust the substance more and more until the point you get to a therapeutic dose. Worst case scenario, you won’t feel much.

I’m particularly sensitive to THC. It just doesn’t make me feel great. That being said, I can handle a 20:1 or even 10:1 (CBD:THC) ratio just fine. In fact, it works better than just full spectrum CBD. It took a lot of trial and error and finding the right strain that gave me the effects I wanted (in the case of vaping hemp flowers, but same principle applies to CBD oils). 

Also, be aware that the success rate of CBD depends greatly on the cause of your anxiety and how the CBD addresses that cause. If it’s rumination and CBD helps stop the endless thinking, then you’ll feel relief. If you’re feeling fearful and CBD gives a different perspective and things don’t seem as scary, then you’ll feel relief too. It’s not about sedating yourself per se, it’s about toning down the exaggerated anxious responses to negative stimuli. 

The reason CBD never gave me a panic attack was because of this. When it started working, it addressed the core reason WHY I was getting anxious."

It’s THE reason why the path for Puerto Rican statehood is not as clear as people make it seem to be. 

Multiple cultures exist in the US but they exist within the umbrella of US culture. PR exists outside of that umbrella and has been doing its own thing for many years now. 

The influence of American culture is as strong as it is in Canada or Mexico. It’s a powerful culture but being a territory doesn’t make it that much more influential than if it were an independent country. 

Indeed, the culture won’t change much unless a large amount of Americans moved to the island. That is unlikely to happen now or in the foreseeable future unless the federal government and the Puerto Rican government give massive incentives for average people to come move to the island."

Basically, if they don’t reciprocate back (they don’t have to be perfect, but they need to show that they care about me), I put some distance. Relationships are about commitment to some degree or another after all.  

You also need to be very careful with people who WANT to feel like they’re your best friend without needing to put in any work. It’s incredibly narcissistic, and people just end up treating others as if they were disposable. These tend to have lots of friends and they all say superficial things about how good friends they are but they’re rarely there for each other.

Socioeconomic factors, feeling of belonging, and just general cultural differences play a role. Each community, even online ones, have differing demographics, and they can self-segregate the same way people sometimes do in the real world. 

It might also become a cycle in which those couples don’t see many other interracial couples so they don’t post.

AskGaybrosOver30,f9lbfq4,t3_e5lta9,1575418999.0,"Hey there! I’m 33 so hopefully you’ll find my experiences useful :) 

I would answer to all of your questions. 

I’m a fairly tall guy, but I was overweight for a few years in my early 30s. No one thought I was overweight, not even myself, because of my height. It wasn’t until I started losing weight hat I realized how plump I was. Hehe. My top weight was 200 lbs (I’m 6”1). 

Within two years I was weighing 147 lbs. Main reason? Horrible anxiety from grad school burnout and existential crises. Panic attacks and anxiety made losing weight fairly easy, even if that wasn’t my goal. 

Around the time of my birthday last year I got my anxiety under control, made major lifestyle changes. Last November I then started going to the gym. I started eating more, going to the gym 3 times a week, then 4. 

I slowly gained muscle and kept losing the skinny belly fat I had. I was basically starting from zero, muscle wise. I have never been athletic in my life. 

Fast forward to today, I’m 158 lbs, relatively low fat. I look athletic and toned. Each month I keep gaining muscle and I’m getting beefier with time. I’m still fairly slim, but I look good (muscular guys are starting to hit on me now!)

You have to be patient though. It’s a journey and it takes a lot of research and trial and error to find a routine and diet that works for you. It’s not easy, it requires dedication, but it’s worth it. 

As for my sex drive, I felt a boost in it as soon as I started working out. The confidence boost you get also helps. It’s very psychological. You feel sexy so you’re more sexy, so to speak. This boosts your libido as well. 

People tell me that I look younger now than when I was in my 20s (I was skinny and boyish looking then.)

If you want general advice, send me a message! I’d like to think I have knowledge to offer. I really like my current routine. Don’t mind sharing some progress pics too if you’d like some inspiration.

Good luck!"

SeriousConversation,f9gjluc,t3_e4vuxo,1575300351.0,"We live in a time where there’s many people who are starving for touch. You haven’t done anything wrong, even if she was a prostitute. I think more people would benefit from accepting that they need touch.

I do recommend massage therapy for you. Not because you did anything wrong, but because it can be incredibly therapeutic for people that struggle to receive touch on a more regular basis. Try to go for something relaxing like Swedish or Californian. There’s a lot of different modalities out there that you could benefit from and are more widely socially accepted if that’s something that worries you."

Anxiety,f95fsyl,t3_e3o044,1575126842.0,"You are NOT a coward. You are human and you struggle with anxiety, like many of us.

Anxieties are often the result of us not feeling like we’re good enough, like we did something wrong. In your case, I’d recommend working on things that improve your self-esteem :) With stronger self-esteem, it becomes easier to stand your ground. You matter as much as other people do, your needs aren’t less. Repeat these mantras more often, even when you feel like you “gave in” to anxiety and stayed quiet. Set challenges for yourself, start small. If you receive an order incorrectly at a coffee shop or restaurant, tell them instead of staying quiet, stuff like that. Tell it to friends that you know will understand and practice being assertive. 

You can do this, you got this."
Anxiety,f95ewhs,t3_e3w9k4,1575126324.0,"I haven’t experienced your exact situation but have been in situations where I felt like I did something wrong and it was related to sex in a way.

More often than not, our inner conflicts are the result of a tension within us regarding our sense of right and wrong. You mentioned that you had trouble forgiving yourself, which means that there’s a strong feeling of guilt you’re trying to resolve. One pitfall is that, given the language you’re using, you’re replaying the events again and again, most likely imagining different horrible outcomes each time.

First of all, stop engaging in the behaviour that’s causing you anxiety. In this case, you’ve already identified enough arguments against the drunk hookup culture and its pitfalls, so stop engaging in it even if it’s for the sake of lowering your anxiety. Second, give yourself time to process it all but also show yourself some compassion and be more realistic. It doesn’t seem like you’ve hurt anyone, and you can ask your partners to make sure if you want extra reassurance. If you can’t reach out to some of them because you don’t have their contact information then try and trust that you didn’t do anything wrong. 

Moving on is hard, it takes time, but it also takes self-reflection and sometimes therapy. When we feel that we “lost control” or gave into desires, leading to us doing something wrong, it can be scary. The truth is we go through ethical situations all the time and do ethically questionable things without batting an eye. 

I remember once being at a friend’s place and opening his drawer. It was impulse and felt wrong when I did it. That being said, you think I replayed it time and time again like I do other stuff? Not at all. It’s unethical, but seeing someone’s handkerchief and keys wasn’t really a war crime...

When it comes to sex, physically hurting others, or breaking the law in some way, many people, including myself, can become extremely obsessed about our actions. In order to live in a functional society, we need these psychological mechanisms ingrained in our brains to prevent us from doing something wrong and not act on impulse. The problem is that they can sometimes go way overboard and start hurting us mentally. The good news is, the people that obsess about these things are often the least likely to act out those same thoughts. Their unconscious is already (excessively) policing the person so it’s unlikely that they’ll act on it. 

If you see yourself replaying what happened again and again, and you see yourself spiral deeper and deeper in anxiety, it’s more a form of self-punishment than anything else. It doesn’t really amount to anything. Instead, if you commit to change, and forgive yourself, and move forward without judgment, you’ll feel lighter and more in control. You are allowed to make mistakes after all, we all are.

The other problem with self-punishment is that there’s no end to it. Are you going to punish yourself for a week? A month? A year? Forever? Does anyone really deserve that? It helps to take a step back and put things in perspective.

In my opinion, this obsession with guilt and questionable actions stem from a fear of losing control. You question your own memory to such a point that you train your body to react as if you DID do something utterly horrible and unforgivable. On top of this, because you keep doing it, your body keeps thinking you did it recently, even if it’s been weeks, months, or even years. Replaying it might seem like a way to resolve the issue, but it’s not. It’s a form of reassurance seeking that will ultimately backfire. 

In short, change your behaviour, get away from potential triggers for behaviour (certain friends and family that might engage in drinking until you blackout), give yourself some space and time alone not being around reminders of what you think you did wrong. Also, make a plan to “make amends”. If that means asking one of your sexual partners about how they felt, do it. After you’ve done that, work on moving on. You did what you set yourself to do to make amends and you changed your behaviour. After that, you’ve done what you can and that’s enough. 

The guilt will linger for a while because your mind is dead set in believing that you’re guilty to prevent you from “doing it again” EVEN if you didn’t do anything wrong. That’s the trap. Rewiring your brain takes time, but take it one day at a time and go to therapy if you think it would help."
CBD,f8vlj9a,t1_f8viojm,1574872158.0,"I was in the same boat as you. Again, unless the medication has a warning on it not to take it if you consume grapefruits, you don’t need to worry. Also, this applies more to really high doses of these medications, people who are already close to the daily dose limit. .25 mg is nowhere near that if I’m not mistaken.

Hemp flowers are awesome for slowly phasing out benzodiazepines. You don’t need to do it overnight or anything, just take your time exploring and see what works (dosing, strength, etc.j."
CBD,f8vktzq,t3_e2frha,1574871711.0,"“Cannabis helps control the fear, preventing one’s mind from going into overdrive.”

This describes very well how hemp flowers helped control my obsessive thinking and worrying. I used to get these horrible episodes of obsessive worrying that would spiral into anxiety and panic attacks. They seemed unstoppable, no amount of rationalization or logic could control the compulsive thinking. 

I then smoked a hemp flower during a bad episode and it disrupted the whole process. Like it said in the article, it prevented my mind from going into overdrive. Those huge worries shrunk because I wasn’t obsessing over them. 

This changed everything for me. It actually took power away from those thoughts. It was clear how much those thoughts were damaging me, how not thinking about these things didn’t lead to disaster or to me ignoring problems. If anything, I was able to make better decisions based on calm thinking.  Ironically, after that, I haven’t had a single episode. I haven’t needed it. 

I think this is an example of a substance helping you tap into a different state of mind and opening the door to accessing it without it afterwards. I consider myself very lucky that I benefited to much from it.

That being said, I still get obsessive worries and anxiety, but it’s manageable and I know how to put those thoughts away because they have now lost their power. I also know I have a tool to help me if it happens again in the future."

Anxiety,f74fdmw,t3_dubotu,1573401629.0,"There’s a lot of strategies for potentially overcoming this phenomenon. Sadly, our mind and body are designed to protect us, and they get a bit overprotective and as such, go haywire. 

Something that I started doing lately that I’ve had some success in is thinking of the thought that triggers the anxiety, then put the thought away and focus on the sensations. Just the sensations. The idea is that you need to give the mind and body time to process fully the perceived danger. It’s akin to how wild animals handle stress. They get in fight or flight, escape danger, rest a bit and let the stress hormones exit the system. After that, they go along their merry way.

Human brings are more complex though, so we need to do this process multiple times until our minds rewire, so to speak, and stop triggering the stress response JUST from a single thought that is now irrelevant to our everyday wellbeing."
Anxiety,f6z8z4e,t1_f6qxamr,1573312484.0,"I think it’s good that you’re aware of it. I don’t want to discourage you from getting it, but I do want to share my experience. I was never really “addicted” to Klonopin (a benzodiazepine) in the traditional sense of the word. I was never craving for more, I didn’t want to keep using it, I didn’t use it constantly to escape from reality. I kept a consistent dose that slowly went up through the years. It helped me get through some tough times. I never once thought I was addicted or dependent on it.

That was until I started lowering the dosage. The chemical dependency that develops quietly sneaks up on you when you least expect it. The withdrawal was horrible, and felt worse than my original symptoms. I was caught in an anxiety, panic, and  disassociation loop that was hard to break. Eventually I did with the help of medical cannabis. I don’t take anything.

Im not saying you’re going to develop a dependency no matter what. It depends on a lot of complicated factors. That being said, the chances go up the longer and more consistently you take it. So yes, seek the treatment you need, but just because you didn’t get addicted to painkillers doesn’t mean you won’t develop a dependency on benzodiazepines."
Anxiety,f6z891m,t1_f6qrki6,1573311907.0,"You’re right about the Gabapentin. I think most meds lose their effectiveness with time now that I think about it. The problem always goes back to constantly having to increase the dose. Sooner or later you’ll end up at the max dosage and then you either stay there and not get the same effects anymore or you switch to a stronger drug.

i agree, alternative methods work best. I still think medication plays a huge role but it has to be accompanied by lifestyle changes and some sort of therapy."
Anxiety,f6qmc1z,t3_dsn16y,1573080506.0,"It can be extremely frustrating when we don’t have a proper treatment. Personally, I discourage people to use benzodiazepines as a form of long term treatment. The body quickly becomes dependent on them and you eventually need to take more to get symptoms under control. Consider trying other medications and see how that works. A friend of mine has had good results with a medication called Gabapentin, for example."
Anxiety,f6qlz71,t3_dsnf2w,1573080267.0,"I’m 33, and my advice is to stress less about making a mistake. You will make mistakes of one sort or another. The really important part is to check in with yourself every now and then to see if you’re on track. If you dislike your path, ask yourself why and reassess. Then plan a change and take that path. 

No amount of research or overthinking will guarantee success or not having regrets. Sometimes you really don’t know until you try.   


For now, focus on what really matters to you. By that I mean your values and lifetime goals. By goals I mean in terms of personal growth, not a job title or salary. Do you want to help others? Do you want to solve problems? Do you want a calm work environment or a busy one?

I’ve lived my life following my passions, and I’m now doing something completely unrelated to them. Don’t be afraid of making mistakes, each one offers you a chance to learn something about yourself. Life doesn’t have to be high stakes."
Anxiety,f6ql89j,t1_f6qe758,1573079776.0,Sounds like a scripted reaction so to speak. By this i mean that your body does it know because it associates the thought or memory with a specific bodily movement. I think it’s quite normal. Not unlike being startled if someone talks to you out of nowhere when you thought you were alone.
Anxiety,f6ql1g2,t3_dsmchq,1573079652.0,This is awesome! Congratulations! I know very well what it’s like to struggle with long flights and little rest. Those situations really push our anxiety buttons all at once.
CBD,f6cr72n,t3_dqp58u,1572787880.0,"I started taking cbd when I was tapering off my Klonopin usage. Unlike you, I was taking it every day and was experiencing tolerance withdrawal. When I first tried cbd oil, I was let down because it didnt do much of anything. The Klonopin felt so powerful in comparison.   


After that my doctor referred me to a cannabis dispensary. There, they had another cbd oil. It was like a thick paste, and green. The ratio was something like 40:1 cbd:thc. I put some on a spoon and put it under my tongue. I was shocked when I felt my body letting go of the anxiety and panic. My mind stopped thinking for a few minutes and I just felt relief. Blood went back to my limbs and didn’t feel cold anymore. That’s when I knew I found something.

it was a positive experience, but it didn’t solve the whole problem. The sedative effect only lasted about 20 minutes. I was calmer after, but the withdrawal symptoms of the Klonopin were overwhelming at times. Still, I persevered.

I kept using different cbd products after that. I played with cbd:thc ratios and different strains. I look for strains that “short circuit” the obsessive thinking cycle of my brain when it’s in high anxiety mode. I’ve found that if that happens, my anxiety just drops. I’ve said this in other posts but the way I see cbd differently from a benzodiazepine like Klonopin, is that Klonopin gives ou a false impression that everything is ok. Even if it’s for a moment. With cbd, I feel like I’m momentarily disabling something closer to the root of my anxiety rather than numbing myself and giving me an illusion of safety. This led to long term not needing any cbd on a daily or weekly basis. It was like a crutch of sorts that encouraged me to work things out mentally.

And this applies to whatever treatment you use. Ideally, you want to not need medication, and that requires finding out what the root cause of the anxiety is, can it be changed? Can you change your lifestyle?

A big reason I don’t use cbd anymore is because I changed my lifestyle significantly. Stopped seeing people that contributed to my anxiety, changed professions, started exercising multiple times a week, and just took better care of myself. 

Anyway, at the end of the day, it could also be that you simply don’t benefit much from cannabis. I do recommend that before you give up, you look into hemp flowers (I believe they have a subreddit) and you try out a few different strains first."
StarWars,f5a2bo4,t1_f4ppsqt,1572099232.0,"That’s one of my favourite lines. Along with “Strike me down in anger and I’ll always be with you... just like your father.”

I understand not liking certain things about the movie but I don’t get why they can’t also accept the really good things about it."
CBD,f3aawo7,t1_f3719d8,1570766548.0,"Hemp refers to little to no THC, high CBD cannabis plants. Flower refers to the buds of those plants. Same as weed/marijuana, this buds can be inhaled.

It’s a lot safer than vaping because there’s no oil that’s being inhaled. Instead, the heat in a dry herb vaporizer heats the herb to the right temperature where the CBD and other chemicals become a gas, and it can then be inhaled. It’s not burning the plant so it’s relatively safe.

You can find low thc/high cbd flowers on dispensaries. There’s different strains too. Ask for something for anxiety with little to no chance of getting anxiety. I’ve honestly never gotten anxious from it. It’s very mild. The strain I use is called remedy.

Hope this helps."
