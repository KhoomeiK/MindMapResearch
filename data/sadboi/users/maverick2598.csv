My plant has been going for about 4 weeks I think. Recently the bottom most leaves, the seedling ones, started to yellow and die off. I kinda thought that might be natural and wasn’t concerned but now the leaves the next level up are starting to do the same. I was worried it could be due to a couple factors such as the environment(I live at the beach so maybe exposure to salt via rain), or some plant food I added a little after i repotted it(maybe 1 week ago).

I haven’t taken any sort of recovery seriously out of embarrassment or invalidating feelings, because I’ve never felt like I am “allowed” to have these problems. Been off and on from diets, drugs, and just food in general since as long as I remember. Lately gotten deep into the drugs and even ran a couple dnp cycles as well. That shit is hell man I am sorry you had to go through that. Something different about making that choice that will stay with me for a long time. Now especially with recent events I feel like I’m in this limbo of honestly just exhaustion. Any sort of efforts I make now seem to all have slow ass results. This problem is so isolating and especially when you keep it a secret from everyone too. If you ever want someone to talk to or something feel free to message me.

No one picks up on behaviors or cries for help because they don’t expect to see it in a guy. Makes it really easy for the Ed to work and grow without notice. Kinda scary tbh. Over the recent years I have noticed and heard about more guys with disordered eating who don’t believe they have a problem or don’t feel justified in having one, but still have yet to meet another guy with a diagnosed disorder too. I never know what to say to them or how to help considering I’m probably not one to give advice. But it is bittersweet knowing I’m not alone in this. Just sucks to know others are going through it. I’m glad it’s being more acceptable for guys to speak up about it now and feel more validated. Subs and posts like this honestly help a lot."

EdAnonymousAdults,f6vjge5,t3_dt6m2w,1573188043.0,"I tried to share and open up about my ED with two of my ex SOs, something I regret both times. Especially with my most recent girlfriend, which my ED is actually kinda the reason we broke up. Granted I’m probably not in a solid mental state to be having a serious relationship, considering I’m already in one with my ED, so I guess it was for the best. But the time between me opening up to her until us breaking up a couple months later was pretty shitty. It could’ve been due to her personality, considering everyone is different, but she ended up almost obsessing over it out of concern. I constantly felt micromanaged and watched in my daily life. Whenever I tried to open up to hear about what was happening or what I was thinking that day, she just became more upset and concerned, and it felt like I was just making her mental state worse. Again, this is probably different between people, so I think it really just depends on how you handle it and what type of person your SO is. It’s a very thin line of what to tell them and what to leave just for therapy and quite a hard one to walk at that. Hopefully if you educate them and set realistic boundaries it’ll be more successful. Unfortunately I don’t think I will choose to share it again until I’m in recovery fully, just not worth the risk. Then again I guess I shouldn’t be in a relationship at this mental state. Sorry for the rambling and vent lol just getting some thoughts down I guess. Hopefully it helps"

bulimia,f6kfqro,t3_drf9ob,1572911588.0,"I relate to this a lot. I am not one to talk about any of my problems or share it with people. Even SO typically. Unfortunately I decided to try and break that habit with my past two girlfriends and be open with them, which did not turn out well. 

Honestly, I’m all for being open in a relationship and such. I think in a real and true relationship, you should be able to share and be open about struggles and issues. To have a support system that includes a SO I’m sure is great(I wouldn’t know lol). My experience in the matter hasn’t been great. Both of my SO I tried to share with and be open to about my problems with, did not take it well. They both ended up blaming relationship problems on my ED, getting angry at me for the behaviors my ED caused, and consistently tried to micromanage me (such as getting angry with me if I missed a meal). Im not sure why they both did those things, but my guess is that they were not used to dealing with mental illness and did not know how to act, even though I tried to help them understand. I’m sure having the right person can be very helpful when recovering and battling an ED, but I have resolved not to tell any future SOs or even try and date while I’m dealing with this shit. It’s like having two different relationships competing for my time haha. Obviously I probably shouldn’t be giving relationship advice, but hopefully my thoughts give some help as to things to look out for I guess. Best of luck, hopefully you can do better than I have."
