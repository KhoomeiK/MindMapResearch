Empaths,ep6lymj,t3_btzfyk,1559070719.0,"Mirror work. If you aren't familiar with it, this is how it works:
1]Make direct eye contact with yourself in the mirror
2]Focus on your pupils, not irises
3] say ""I love you""
4]Rinse and repeat as needed üòâ

It make take time to be able to do this. Some people break the mirror, cry, cannot hold gaze with self, etc. Personally, I cried. A lot. Whenever I start to feel jot so awesome I go back to mirror work."

raisedbynarcissists,eoxs5ts,t3_bt8tsk,1558928220.0,I felt that way when I bought myself a laptop! I went years without a computer and felt guilty. That I should buy my parents or siblings something instead. I think we (adult children of narcs) got so used to being selfless in a negative way. This is just a stepping stone for the you towards healthy selfishness. Yay!
