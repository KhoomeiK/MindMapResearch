femalehairadvice,f7943bz,t3_dut1zg,1573502325.0,Yes a the toner they most likely used is going to wash out in about 2 weeks if you are washing w warm/hot water. Has it been longer then 48 hours since you had it done? You can wash before the allotted time or more frequently then you will be back to square one. More likely she toned you a seasonal color & not more icey. Next time you go in ask for the opposite.
femalehairadvice,f792y59,t3_dueq2a,1573501873.0,Ice cold water & no heat! The type of color ur stylist could have used is definitely going to stain. It‚Äôs going to be all over you actually. Don‚Äôt go to bed with ur hair wet either. Everything you are going through right now is completely normal with vivid colors.
