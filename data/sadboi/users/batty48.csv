I spend hours online being kind to people I don't know, but I hardly speak to anyone in my real life anymore.  I'm sorry she was so cruel to you, you didn't deserve it at all. Just  ""get over it"" is never helpful, you're a human with feelings, you need time to heal. It's okay to feel your pain, just don't unpack and live there. Do you know what I mean?

You sound like such a lovely caring person, I hope you can see that about yourself!

It's really unfortunate her mom is letting her spiral this way as is can be really dangerous.. I hope they can figure it out and get her back into treatment before things get too bad. Nightmares could be a medication side effect or a different issue altogether (I have them but mine are from PTSD, I take a medication that mostly gets rid of them, but I understand they're debilitating and scary). If a new symptom arises, like nightmares, it's always a good idea to she tell her doctor so they can adjust or change medication rather than just stopping it altogether.

The best thing you can do is try to put yourself first here and try to admit it's over and move on.

You can let her know you care and you are here for her (if that's what you want), maybe she will seek treatment again in the future and realize she made a mistake. I would suggest you don't ""wait"" for her tho. You can't save her from herself, unfortunately.
