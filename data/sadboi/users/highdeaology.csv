benzodiazepines,fqf8n4h,t1_fq8zf7j,1589320558.0,Totally understand. I left just as it was getting really bad and when I left they were actually still letting patients in after a screening process but about a week after one of the people that I went there with called me and said that they completely stop letting people in to the center all together
suboxone,fq8hj52,t3_ghb1kx,1589166332.0,"It’s the subs. That much I’d be throwing up for a full 24 hours feeling like shit when I took it. If you are going to take it again, just know that after you get “high” a few times on subs, that starts to go away and you won’t be able to really get high unless you stop for a long time. But the next time you do take one take a quarter of the strip if not less. You really only need like 1 mg. And also when it comes to subs it’s not about how much you take. It’s always pretty much plateaus at a certain amount no matter if you take 1 mg or 5 mg."

benzodiazepines,fq8fb6e,t3_ghbonz,1589164910.0,"Unrelated to the question you were asking but I was in benzodiazepines for three years and actually Got checked into a detox/rehab for 14 days and got off benzos mediately. I didn’t even have them the day before I went in. I was not given anything to taper I was only put on phenobarbital to stop seizures/ muscle twitching etc. 

It was effortless. I was tired from the phenobarbital but literally after three days you’re done with detox and you join the general population in doing more activities. I would do it 1 million times over because you are so closely supervised by nurses and doctors that anything you need is provided for in a safe and controlled setting.

As for what’s going on you could go to an ER if you cannot wait until tomorrow but if you can wait until tomorrow you said you don’t know how to get in touch with your doctor? The doctor should have a nurse on call that will give you a call back regarding what’s going on but I’m sure that you can find someway to get a hold of him."

Drugs,fov9zkr,t1_fov6e2c,1588097835.0,To be honest it’s not well-known that where there’s tobacco there’s nicotine. A lot of people think that it is added into cigarettes on top of the tobacco when they spray it down.
suboxone,fov2vkx,t3_g9l1rm,1588094495.0,"Be as honest as possible. Just answer the questions they ask you no matter what. I was very nervous as well but it’s way more simple than I thought it was they are just going to ask you about what you used how much you use for how long you used, and then they will talk about different treatment options as they have like methadone, Suboxone or the naltrexone shot. From there you will work out a treatment plan probably having to go see the doctor once a week until they can trust you that you are consuming the medication you’re not selling it or diverting it. You’re also going to have to take a urine test so that they can get a baseline to see what substances are in your system. If you go there with no Opiates in your system, they’re going to have a hard time believing that you have an addiction since it’s out of your system and at that point you’re sober and you don’t need to be on a medication so just be wary of that.These doctors truly want to help people stay sober. They are not out to get you. They are in this line of business because they’ve seen how bad opiate addiction can get. Good luck and you got this! I got on subs three years ago and it changed my life."
Drugs,fov2i6l,t1_fov2gk7,1588094324.0,Yes it has nicotine
Drugs,fov27g2,t3_g9r8od,1588094184.0,Yes you can buy rolling tobacco. There are a few companies that do a really good job and the tobacco tastes really good. Cigarettes have little rings of chemicals on the outside of the paper so that it has a consistent burn all the way through and in terms of everything else they do it for taste even though I can’t imagine how any of that stuff makes it taste better.

suboxone,fnaru1j,t1_fnap3c3,1586802706.0,This is just what the rehab center had told me while I was there. Every doctor and nurse was on the same page about this and they’ve been around since the 30s. They also detox me in a matter of three days off of benzodiazepines which is commonly talked about on here as being impossible but yet I’m living testament to it
suboxone,fnarr4j,t1_fnaj7v0,1586802666.0,Hey I’m just saying what my rehab center had all spoken to me about while I was there
suboxone,fnaro75,t1_fnalku8,1586802624.0,"In the treatment center that I was in all of the doctors and nurses separately recommended that if I have the intentions of being on maintenance my entire life since I’ve already been on Suboxone for three years, I should consider switching to methadone because over a long term it is more sustainable. That is simply what they told me, I have yet to do the actual research about it but this is a treatment institution that has been around since the 40s. They also detox me off of benzodiazepines over just the course of three days with a Phenobarbital tabor which was effortless. Everyone on This website though will tell you that after being on benzo’s for years, there’s no way that somebody could get off of them in a matter of days but here I am I did it and was extremely successful. Everyone thinks they are a doctor or know what’s best for somebody on this website so there’s a lot of miss information I have found from personal experience"
suboxone,fnaq6oz,t1_fnao8ym,1586801879.0,Of course people gave me thumbs down but that’s just because they are not educated. I literally just left a rehab and every single nurse or doctor was telling me that if my intention was to be on it for life that I should switch.I’m not saying it’s physically impossible to be on it for your entire life. People can be on heroin for their entire life but my point was that methadone is universally seen as the better alternative for lifelong treatment. I was preached about that while I was in rehab. I’m not sure why either.
suboxone,fna5voi,t3_g0kai9,1586791615.0,"Suboxone is not something that is prescribed for life. I had the same thought about it and it has helped me stay clean. I have an use the ones since I started but that being said I want to rehab for benzo‘s and they strongly urged that I start to think about Tabron because I’ve been on them for three years and it’s not something that’s necessarily good for your body to be on for the rest of your life. If you do plan on staying on maintenance for the rest of your life they like to switch you over to methadone because it is much easier on the body and the way that works. I would suggest talking to your doctor and mentioning that this is something that you would like to be on extremely long term and see what they recommend but it wasn’t just one or two people that told me that it was multiple doctors, multiple psychiatrists and multiple counselors for drug counseling. I definitely agree with you that the benefits are fantastic but just be educated and be safe regardless of what you choose. Methadone works for exactly the same thingBut you can just be on it for life and not have to worry"
benzorecovery,fna5ig2,t3_g0cs90,1586791420.0,No you need to taper. I went to a treatment center for detox and it was so effortless. I don’t regret going and I would go 1 million times over. The detox you with a medically supervised taper in a controlled setting and you learn so much there about addiction and other things
PoliticalHumor,fn4evuq,t1_fn2jvhl,1586639960.0,Up
PoliticalHumor,fn4eu3n,t3_fys238,1586639931.0,I have found that the steps have been very straightforward and easy. Just have to make sure you file your taxes for last year or the year before and if you qualify you’ll get a check and I just applied for unemployment online and it was very painless. I just had to sit down for 15 minutes and I had it done.
benzorecovery,fn4e9ar,t1_fn49f2j,1586639589.0,"Well if that is the case there are other alternatives. You can attend an outpatient program which you talk to a therapist and you have meetings with the doctor a few times a week sometimes 2 to 3 and you should also get a hold of the narcotics anonymous text. It’s a great book and really installs hope and effective way of avoiding substances and staying clean. I would also recommendGoing to virtual any meetings as of the current time because obviously the virus has taken away the privilege of going to in person ones but they are a great means of connecting with other people in the same position, learning what they have done and be able to apply it to your old life. These things have been instrumental in keeping me sober. I would be in the same position I was before if I did not employ these things. The initial anxiety that I got on to benzodiazepines for no longer plays a major part in my life because I am not binging Xanax and I am not taking anything and so I am far more readily available to deal with my anxiety and my fear. It has become such a small small aspect of my life where before it ruled me. Definitely check out the virtual any meetings. You can go to one or multiple ones a day. They have them every single hour of the day. I wish you luck and I know you can do this because I did it and I was in a terrible terrible spot but you mentioned you were in college so you have a lot going for you. A lot of the time we think oh I haven’t done this yet or I haven’t done this yet so I can’t be that bad but it doesn’t take losing everything to realize there’s a problem. You got this! You have to be willing to help yourself in any means accessible to you. Treatment centers are onlyTwo weeks to four weeks long so if you have a break and you could somehow fit it in even if it was just a week to detox you that’s all you need. You can explain to them that you have school and the next time that you have a break get prepared with the literature and get yourself set up a meeting so that you just have to go for a week get detoxed and then can return back to those meetings and everything else."
