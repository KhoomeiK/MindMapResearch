I could recognize people, places, and things, but I felt like I had no connection to any of then. It was like watching an old memory I already forgot about. 

I didn’t wanna look at myself in the mirror because I had a feeling doing that and seeing my own face in that state would’ve fucked me up even worse. 

Mine lasted almost 4 hours and it only ended because I forced myself to sleep at 3 in the afternoon. Was still feeling pretty disconnected when I woke up hours later. I’ve experienced this before but never while sober, and that was the scary part."

All the things you said about validation is valid (ha) and as I’ve said that is something I have been working on in therapy due to abuse and trauma that has nothing to do with this. However, I don’t think it’s fair to say that “the amount [I’m] hurt is a lot for a couple of dates.” As I’ve mentioned I’m not upset about getting “dumped” per se, I’m upset about being blindsided and feeling like I was being led on. This means A saying he was interested in more on our own, then literally the next day telling me *they* decided not to do this at all.

I had also asked them if things were okay when they started responding less and they reassured me everything was fine, to then later drop that on me while also at the same time telling me they wanted to keep seeing me."

tattoos,eys1gis,t3_cyhsj2,1567384335.0,"I honestly wouldn’t recommend getting a tattoo that early in your life. I thought I knew what I wanted and what would be “a part of my life forever” at 16 as well and now I’m almost 24 and I’m glad I never got the tattoo(s) I wanted when I was 16. 

I got a pretty big forearm tattoo when I was 20 that I love still and I thought I knew where I wanted to be in life and that this tattoo and its placement won’t affect me because I wanted to do music, and now I’m in law school to become an attorney and I’m constantly trying to cover up that one tattoo in most formal situations, especially during the summer. 

Moreover, even if you do end up still wanting the same general idea, you may feel differently about style, etc. as your taste may also change. Something you find pretty now might end up looking tacky to you 5 years later because you might have a more matured taste later on. 

As far as growth, that depends on your body and the tattoo placement. For example, as a woman, getting a thigh tattoo might be affected by this because the female body stretches around that area a lot through puberty. 

You can honestly afford to wait at least a couple more years until you’re actually 18."

Last night I got into bed having it made up in my mind that I was going to make another attempt. The last time I was there mentally was only in May. As soon as I made that decision, I felt so terrified and alone and I ended up doing something I’ve never done before: I told a friend what I was thinking. 

They quickly sent me an Uber to come over to their place. So I went over and spent an hour petting a rabbit and talking about nothing for hours. This morning I woke up on their couch and opened this thread again and just felt a familiar pang in my chest reading your comments understanding exactly what I was feeling. 

I can’t say yet that I’m glad I didn’t do it, but I think I’ll give fighting another try for now."

CPTSD,exdolvi,t1_excy2uz,1566182272.0,"I wish I was there mentally. I’ve been better at it with platonic relationships I think because the level of vulnerability is not the same as sexual relationships (my trauma is related to this). 

I find I’m much better at taking back control over my boundaries and my peace when sex is not involved. I recently cut off a friend who was toxic and selfish and felt proud for walking out of that situation. Baby steps, I guess."
CPTSD,excxkb0,t1_excwuuj,1566162082.0,"My relationship history has been quite chaotic, and this is not even counting the pseudo high school “relationships” I’ve had. I keep setting boundaries with my partners and keep feeling them toeing the line, but always feeling terrified of enforcing the boundaries I have set because I was perpetually afraid of them leaving me for being “too much” for it. 

I remember distinctly a recent relationship where I’ve specifically mentioned, “Please don’t do X” after asking them if they were okay with me if I do X and they said they were fine. And then they would keep doing X and whenever I tell them, please don’t do that again, I get “called out” for being “selfish” or “hypocritical” because I do X when they’re “not allowed to” although it was just a difference in boundaries, knowing that had they told me not to do X either I wouldn’t have and I never went out of my way to consciously do it. 

Boundaries or so difficult for me because ever since I was young, I’ve had it deeply engrained in me by people I loved the most that they (boundaries) were selfish and unfair, and in turns I just feel selfish and unfair for not tolerating behaviors that hurt me deeply. It is so exhausting to live and love like that but I feel like I’m stuck in this cycle and don’t know how to get out of it."
CPTSD,excwptt,t3_cqumm2,1566161480.0,"I feel this on such a deep level. My last partner kept calling me manipulative even though I tried so, so hard not to be and have put in so much work into communicating my feelings (if I do it at all) effectively and calmly. And as much as I love him, I kept in turns feeling like I was being manipulated into feeling guilty about my emotions. And I don’t know if this is true or valid, or just residual trauma from my abuse and the way my parents have always reacted to every single emotion I’ve ever had since I was little. 

I kept coming into my therapist’s office at the edge of crying just asking her what did I do wrong, what is it that I wasn’t supposed to say or do, why is it that I felt like I tried so hard but it’s never enough, where did I go wrong, where am I lacking. 

I obsessed over how I communicate with people, showing her every single texts I’ve sent, going over every conversation I’ve ever had, just feeling this exhaustion and desperation for things to finally click and I feel like I’m going crazy and rapidly oscillating between believing I am being manipulative and being manipulated. I feel like people have taken advantage of this about me in the past."

There was a point where my “obsession” peaked when he started dating someone else and I wasn’t jealous (or at least I’m pretty sure I wasn’t) but I just had to *know things* and I didn’t really understand why at first. 

I’ve been pretty good about not doing it though. Strangely enough, lately I’ve been getting such intense emotional and physical reaction to any reminder of him, i.e. faces that look like him, his name, where he’s from. I can’t even say his name out loud, even if the name belonged to someone else in the relevant context."
CPTSD,excrgig,t3_cs2cp4,1566157759.0,"I’m not sure if it counts as dissociation, but everything else you said resonated with me. I think that’s what my therapist has been trying to tell me, too. 

I get stuck in these cycles of unsatisfying, unreciprocated, and manipulative relationships where when the other person periodically holds back affection from me, it gives me a “high” when I do receive it from them. That has always been the only way I know how any relationships have ever worked and anything that isn’t like that terrifies me."
