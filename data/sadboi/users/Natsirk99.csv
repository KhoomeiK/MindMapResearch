- Husband got a job and 3 weeks later tore his ACL,

- Husband had surgery, then pneumonia, then thrush,

- Workers comp claim denied 1 week after his surgery,

- Sued the company,

TwoXChromosomes,fejj5ik,t1_fehi14t,1579176492.0,"This totally reminded me of when my husband brought up the fact that I don‚Äôt keep the house as clean as I used to.

It‚Äôs because I finally thought, ‚Äúwell if he‚Äôs not going to do it, neither am I.‚Äù

When the kids and I got home tonight I had them both empty the dishwasher. I then had my son (7yrs) bring me all the dirty dishes from the living room and my daughter (4yrs) throw away all the trash. When my husband got home he promptly put his trash down and didn‚Äôt put his dirty dishes in the sink. Sigh"

Celiac,fejh3fv,t1_feg56gv,1579173947.0,"Unfortunately(?) we‚Äôre located in the US. Specifically in my state, Alaska, the diagnosis of Celiac doesn‚Äôt affect our current benefits.

A few years back, due to an economic downturn, I became well versed in the state assistance realm. Celiac may have helped with getting more food stamps, but we are no longer on that type of assistance.

I just spent the last 10min ranting about trying to keep my children‚Äôs current state benefits. I figured you wouldn‚Äôt care too much to read it so I deleted it. It was a good outlet and hopefully I can fall asleep now.

Thank you for the conversation."
Celiac,fef59vi,t1_fed7yz1,1579048501.0,"I had my daughter tested and she‚Äôs fine. My husband will be getting tested and I‚Äôm a rebel and decided not to.

For some reason my husband‚Äôs GP told him to binge eat bread (he‚Äôs been GF for two weeks) and to do the biopsy because the blood test isn‚Äôt always accurate.

I responded with, eat like a normal human being and you ARE getting the blood test done first."
