dndmemes,fqg0i2r,t1_fqfwgi9,1589335396.0,Yeah but point buy allows for much greater customization ability and you can make the PCs exactly as powerful as you want them to be by adding or taking away points
dndmemes,fqfmd8t,t1_fqfiocb,1589327508.0,"I agree with the no crits on skill checks thing, I just think there are more fun ways you could use this to build story because if the player had even a +5 bonus then that seems totally plausible to me that the BBEG would buy the claims at least somewhat. I would make them ask the PC to prove themself and then have it be some horrible act so the PC does succeed but it pushes the story forwards in interesting ways. That actually seems like a creative idea and just saying “yep you do that the BBEG fully believes you 100%” or saying “nope he doesn’t believe you now just fight him like I planed” just make the story flatter. I never said that you needed to “just say yes,” but just saying no when it’s a roll that high and an actual idea is just as bad. I hope my players don’t see this but the level one bard rolled a 26 to convince a confused kobold who just left a cult that he was a god and to worship him so I am about to make the kobold start praying and asking for stuff that a level one bard definitely can’t deliver on but would be easy for a god."
dndmemes,fqfj5ep,t1_fqfd5t5,1589325836.0,"But I feel like that is within the realm of possibility if the BBEG is actually religious. I think depending on the modifier I would say that the BBEG believes you somewhat but wants to take away all your weapons and lock you up for now while he gets ready to test your devotion. Then have them need to do whatever fits the story to prove their devotion, but what they have to do is probably awful so they would need to figure out some other way. This creates an interesting little mini story arc and pushes the story forwards instead of shutting it down"
dndmemes,fqfintu,t1_fqfd9b6,1589325581.0,"I agree on the no carita on skill checks, but unless the PC and BBEG had fought before this is definitely not beyond the realm of sensibility if they had a high enough persuasion bonus. I would rule this as somewhere in the range of a 25-30 dc check, so it depending on the modifier I might let it work or I might not. I would still use it to advance the plot though because maybe the BBEG believes them somewhat but wants to test their devotion by them doing some horrible act. That way they still succeeded but it isn’t just an “okay you have the super powerful BBEG’s full trust and devotion and you can kill him in his sleep”"
dndmemes,fqfhql1,t1_fqf2ezh,1589325102.0,Yeah but in that situation it seems totally possible for the BBEG to believe that if the PC was persuasive enough. Just saying no ends up seeming irritating and railroady
