Divorce,fnzn2xc,t3_g4ra5v,1587397183.0,This is so important. So refreshing to find a partnership where both sides are on the same page.
Divorce,fnsluhb,t3_g3ef93,1587224269.0,"Ouch, he sounds pathetic. You are allowed to not want him back and that's okay. Stick to your guns!"
Divorce,fnpn7io,t3_g36vyv,1587148463.0,"Any time I share big news with him, he is not excited. Hardly at all. Kind of dampens my spirits. When we went to a concert of my favorite artist that I had never seen live, he was acting sour and bored."
Divorce,fne4lp7,t3_g0l1nq,1586882961.0,I can give perspective from another side: my parents didn't get divorced and should have.  My mother showed me it was the woman's role to do everything domestically then play the victim about it and blow up at her spouse about once a month she to exhaustion. My father showed me it was the man's role to be emotionally and physically unavailable to his family except for special occasions.  It has made my relationships very unstable as a teen and young adult before I realized these examples were wrong.

Divorce,fk0l9xa,t3_ffu326,1583760136.0,"Nothing is wrong with you, this is a normal part of the grieving process that many people go through. 

But I would recommend professional assistance like seeking therapy or discussing your situation with your primary care physician to help with the depression."

Divorce,fiyz6w7,t3_falw9r,1582850360.0,I think we make a lot of concessions for our partners that we would not make for anyone else. The attorney is smart in that regard and it's probably something a lot of us should take to heart with our STBX.
Divorce,fiyyz7b,t1_fiyvu7u,1582850219.0,I think if you're done but have kids it can be a good way to discuss custody with a compassionate third party before you talk to the lawyer.  But make it clear you are done when you go in together.
Divorce,fixrp9n,t3_fafit5,1582825591.0,"This is horrifying and a clear window into the true character of your wife. I am so sorry that you will never get that moment with your kids, but it seems like you're escaping a toxic person with this process."
Divorce,fiv0fhb,t3_f9s1w9,1582751557.0,"It is really hard to tear your mind away from the plans you had made for a future together. But now you get to make your own future whatever you want. Get therapy to grow more confident because life keeps moving regardless. You are going to want to enjoy it later on, trust that."
EarthPorn,fiuz3w4,t3_f9t3ve,1582750863.0,Gloomy. I like it.
Divorce,fiuyi9z,t3_f9sj9v,1582750556.0,"I think one foot out the door is really one unsteady foot down a steep staircase. More often than not if a person is considering leaving a relationship, it is not an ""if"" but when they will actually leave."
Divorce,feaygbu,t3_eo4zbl,1578953533.0,"In my experience, a partner avoids going to couples counseling when they have a notion that they may be the issue in the relationship. 

They're avoiding being called out for their bad behavior. I'm sorry friend."

polyamory,fb44v07,t3_eb5lbh,1576501520.0,"Ultimatums are inherently *not* poly.  What she's doing is incredibly unfair to you and your mutual partner. 

Your partner needs to stand up for your relationship. If he can't, time to decide if this is a relationship worth continuing on your end."
polyamory,fam6lhf,t3_e9uxyq,1576196808.0,"I think it kind of depends on what information you divulged early on. Did you discuss very intimate details about a dead bedroom or kink? Or was it more surface-level complaints about housework? I don't know if context would help more. It seems like they're making you choose. Is your husband poly as well? 

I think the good thing about having multiple partners is that you have a huge support system that you can use for different perspectives when an issue arises, but you shouldn't badmouth anyone. Maybe your husband is a bit too sensitive or insecure and new boundaries need to be written down so everyone can get on the same page!"
bisexualadults,f2kchmj,t1_f2g1txo,1570283751.0,"I tend to agree, although I don't condone how it was stated.

It's cool that they got to explore, but I don't get why we gloss over, or even praise, cheating in this sub so much.  r/bisexual doesn't seem to have nearly so many posts about doing things without your spouse's consent."
bisexualadults,exvk8eh,t1_exvixie,1566600999.0,"Yeah, did the tinder thing. Encountered a lot of biphobic lesbians that were also not okay with me having current male partners. I haven't looked into poly groups or anything much because it hasn't been that bad an itch to scratch yet."
bisexualadults,exvcp41,t1_exvcbmo,1566596974.0,"Thx for your response. 

I had a girlfriend when I first opened up to the idea of my sexuality and yeah, it just never felt right. I've never imagined a big future with women, but I have lots of good girl friends and would just think that the same energy with a lady would be cool adding that physical element.

Good luck to you too. Where are you located?"
