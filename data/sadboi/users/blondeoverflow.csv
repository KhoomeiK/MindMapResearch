TwoXChromosomes,fovuguf,t1_fouijyv,1588107724.0,"I fully agree with what you said, and just wanted to add that in some cases the liar is just a liar. I dated someone who lied to me about important things from the very beginning, before he would have had an opportunity to see how I react to news I don’t want to accept. 




Hearing that something you thought was true for months was actually a lie is extremely frustrating. Hearing that they were afraid of how you would react is honestly even more. If it’s the truth, let’s talk it out right away. Let’s deal with the fear of the reaction. Lying to keep the peace is an unhealthy and unsustainable habit. 




I don’t think that people should expect to get away with poor behaviour just because they owned up to it. “Babe I cheated on you but you can’t get mad cause I’m being honest! If you get mad I will just lie to you about it next time!” 




^ the last part doesn’t quite apply to OP, but arguing that OP should never react negatively to truth leads to this kind of reasoning"
