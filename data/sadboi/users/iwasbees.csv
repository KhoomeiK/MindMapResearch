Assuming you are adding 1ml media + drug to each well.. (I don't really use 96 well culture plates, so I'm assuming!)

**How much volume do I need?:**

I have 96 wells, so I need 96ml of media, plus a little extra, lets say 2ml- or 98ml total.

**How much total drug do I need?:**

98ml\*4ug/ml= 392ug drug total

**How much stock do I have to add to get that amount of drug?:**

1mg/ml is the same as 1ug/ul (this is a good conversion to memorize!), so your stock has 5ug in every ul.

The total amount we need is 392ug, we can divide this number by 5 to get the number of ul total we need in our media, which is 78.4ul.

**Adjust for the volume of drug you are adding:**

The volume difference is pretty small here, so it probably doesn't matter, but we're trying to add the drug to a TOTAL of 98ml. So we have to subtract the 78.4ul from 98ml. If the reagents are not expensive, instead of doing this as a calculation, I usually pipette 98ml, and remove the 78.4 with my pipette- which is now already set to the correct volume to pipette the drug.

I was also pretty terrible at this stuff when I started working in a lab, but the key is practice. I also used the online calculators someone posted to check my answers before I felt more confident. Good luck!"

Also, if you have a little ice bin you can fill it with water and some ice, put that on a stir plate and place your gel in there for a few minutes. When it's cool to the touch, but still liquid you can pour it and it will solidify within a few minutes. I haven't really had to save gels since I started doing that."

The short answer is: de-escalation should only be used in situations you cant walk away from.  Always maintain a calm, measured tone of voice, try to understand the other person and genuinely empathize, while also negotiating boundaries. 

EDIT: it really depends on the situation- and if the person is making threats or being violent get to a public place and call the police, but for the most part I try to treat the person as if they were a friend, start a dialogue to figure out why they're upset and validate their feelings. This may sound silly, but it works for me. If someone approaches me and is shouting (I live in an area with a lot of bars/restaurants and a big homeless/mentally ill population, so this happens often) I'll make sure that I am in or walk to an area with other people are around. If the person does not let up, I will acknowledge them in a genuine/friendly way and say something like ""hey man, hows your night going?"" This gives them a chance to explain why they're upset- so I try to understand why and empathize and understand/validate their feelings as genuinely as I can ""oh no, that sucks. I hate it when that happens, it seems like you're feeling kind of disrespected? etc..."" At this point I like to introduce myself and ask them their name to develop a rapport. I like to listen for a little bit and then set some boundaries, ""*their name,* Id love to talk but I'm kind of in a rush to get home"" and start negotiating. Hopefully at this point they've calmed down a little bit, but if not think of little ways you can help and try not to say ""no"" and instead try to think of something positive/simple you can do. For example ""I dont have any money but I have a cigarette/can buy you a bag of chips. Would that help?"" I usually carry cigarettes, but if you dont have anything I'd say something like, ""I really wish I could help but I'm broke/have to work early tomorrow/some legitimate reason why you would need to leave."" If at any point they calm down or do something you ask, acknowledge and thank them for it. Once I start to feel like the situation has calmed down I say something like ""It was really nice meeting/talking to you *their name* I have to get home but it seems like you're feeling better?"" 

Basically you're just trying to get out of the situation ASAP and once that seems possible, wish them a really good night and leave. 

Sometimes theres nothing you can do, and the person cant be calmed down, but when it works, its super rewarding. Hope this helps!"

So, I live in a big city and to be honest, while I encounter the stuff like I described weekly, if not daily, I'm never really afraid. I'm very cautious and am an empathetic person who knows a ton about de-escalation. I've actually been able to protect my GUY (and girl) friends from conflict multiple times. I think men often see women as less threatening- and when you're calm, they're much more likely to want to talk to you than fight you. Which can be a huge advantage if you play it right.

I guess my point was that as women we kind of have to suck up our pride to make sure that the situation gets resolved and do whatever it takes to make sure that we and our friends dont get hurt. And I just hope that you never feel like ""less of a man"" for resolving violent situations peacefully. 

What helps me is this: I have a great education, an awesome job, I live in my favorite city and have a cool apartment in a great area. When some homeless dude who's out in the rain asks me to suck his dick, or some desperate dude gets in my way, I see them as the vulnerable one/ victim and can be the bigger person. I've got a lot more going for me and just want to get out of the situation. I actually take a lot of pride in being able to resolve situations like that and having everyone walk away happily. For me, it doesn't really matter who's right or wrong, just that  avoided serious violence. And from your story, it sounds like you did that expertly.

I'd never hit anyone, but I'm saying that for some girls, it's not that they don't expect the guys not to retaliate, they just really don't understand how unfair of a fight it is. You can show them this safely without hurting them too badly."
TwoXChromosomes,fguxw4r,t1_fguwlbe,1581131925.0,"I hear you. What I'm trying to say is that I grew up with women- I didn't have brothers to wrestle with, I didn't play contact sports, my sister and I would (rarely) get into physical fights, but no one was ever actually hurt. I didn't really understand violence or that sort of physicality- when my sister and I would fight it was very minor. I also NEVER hit first and would never use violence against someone unless it was in self-defense. 

If a woman, who has never been in a fight before hits you, she may not know that you can absolutely DEMOLISH her. All I'm saying is, there are ways to say ""Don't ever fucking touch me again"" without beating the shit out of her. If she does it again, go for it."
TwoXChromosomes,fguw55d,t1_fguvlaa,1581130761.0,"Well then we have totally different opinions on how to handle conflict. I try to avoid hurting people. I see you dont.

My point is that most girls dont learn that lesson because theyre girls."
TwoXChromosomes,fguv7kr,t1_fgui6pl,1581130165.0,"Idk. I feel there is such a thing as a proportional response. When I was young I'd never been involved in contact sports, all the dudes I wrestled let me win and I'd never been in a fight before. I hope that if a weaker person ever hits you (especially if she's a young female,) you show them some mercy and restrain them. I definitely had a wakeup call the first time I was (safely) oberpowered by a friend- It's a more humane way to make the same point.

Edit: to be clear, I didn't hit him I was just running my mouth about how I could totally take him with my sick self defense moves."
TwoXChromosomes,fguryzo,t1_fgunc21,1581128065.0,For sure. I've since learned de-escalation techniques and they work way better for me. I've actually been able to break up some tense/scary situations that way and everyone has walked away happy. :)
TwoXChromosomes,fgur8zz,t1_fgup4ai,1581127586.0,"Yeah, after that my bf who was 5'10 and pretty skinny was also able pin me down, but that was my first experience with truly being overpowered. I was 5'7"" 130lb and honestly thought I could at least do a little damage/escape from this massive dude. I had wrestled with guys before and they would always let me win...and i didn't have any experience with fighting or contact sports so that was the first time I realized I was not nearly as strong as I thought I was."
TwoXChromosomes,fgujupa,t1_fgujo1p,1581122598.0,Oh...they did. I was just young at the time and thought I was bulletproof. His demonstration really helped me realize that I wasnt.
TwoXChromosomes,fgu9wgf,t1_fgtauwp,1581115758.0,"I think this is an important lesson to learn and am really, really glad that you learned this with your boyfriend and not in a situation where you were in actual danger!"
TwoXChromosomes,fgu97ca,t3_f0dfmt,1581115298.0,"I had taken some self defense classes when I was younger, and thought I was pretty good at self-defense. Once I was talking with a guy friend of mine who was around 6'2'', 250lbs and I was saying that I could totally take him in a fight. He got very serious and said ""you need to understand, for your own safety, how much stronger I am than you. If someone my size ever comes at you, don't fight. Run."" 

He then told me to hit him as hard as I could and fight him with everything I had. It was like punching a brick wall- within seconds he had me over his shoulder, completely subdued. It was a really big learning moment for me."
labrats,fgtxho1,t3_f00x9e,1581110682.0,"Something else went WRONG with their RNA prep and it's not the elution volume. 

To be honest, I would probably figure out what actually went wrong (probably user error somewhere along the way) or carefully repeat with a 20ul elution volume. If it's ever brought up again you can casually and non-confrontationaly let him know that ""you troubleshooted and found the elution volume wasn't the issue.""

However, if you think you're going to need this guy's help and he's this touchy all the time, I might just try to appease him on this."
aww,fgqg1tn,t1_fgpjm4a,1581023487.0,"I also hate to be a buzzkill but when I got my frenchie my breeder told me not to let him sit in the front seat because if the airbag is deployed....well....they may not survive the impact.

But your dog is adorable! Frenchies are the absolute best and will make you laugh daily with their weird antics.

Edit: I keep a little bed in the back for my frenchie and have a little doggy seatbelt that hooks onto his harness. It's his own little spot and he loves it back there."
dataisbeautiful,fgqbgph,t1_fgpd01k,1581021238.0,"Not sure about a human licking it- though we do have digestive enzymes in our spit, so it could happen. And if mold can grow in a closed container in the fridge, it can definitely grow in a sealed jar- and sealing it would probably be safer."
dataisbeautiful,fgojj3t,t3_ezbbqd,1580972338.0,"I am a female whose had a great career in research- one of the things that inspired me was my dad doing a experiments with me and my sister as a kid. 

Once he took bread slices and put them into mason jars- one was dry, one had a little bit of water in the bottom, and one we let my dog lick. I hypothesized that the one with the water would mold faster, but the one my dog licked was completely disintegrated and he encouraged us to figure out why. (We couldn't figure it out, but he lead us to the answer- digestive enzymes in his spit!)

This is an awesome experiment, and even if your girls aren't interested in the sciences, it's awesome that you're exposing them to the scientific method!!"
TwoXChromosomes,fgocwuj,t3_ezkqur,1580965916.0,This is beautiful! It brightened my day so thank you so much for sharing. I hope you have a long happy life with your future husband and your amazing parents! 💜
TwoXChromosomes,fge43t2,t1_fge3pc8,1580690926.0,"I'm sorry that you had issues with your treatment. Recognizing that I was capable of leaving the situation, had agency over my own life and had the choice to leave if I wanted to was very helpful for me and I've been getting progressively better with boundary setting in my relationships.  I'm sorry you dont feel the same way."
TwoXChromosomes,fge3bv8,t1_fge2t45,1580690399.0,"That's not what I said. I said it's like an addiction in they're addicted to the relationship and cannot leave despite the negative consequences (abuse).  In treatment, you are often encouraged to see the relationship as an addiction. This is not a new thing."
TwoXChromosomes,fgdqpg7,t1_fgd4xic,1580685594.0,"I apologize if I am making assumptions but you dont seem to have a good understanding of abuse dynamics, and I'm guessing you've never experienced it. Telling people who have experienced it how it should be handled instead of asking them about their insights and experiences comes off as agressive, arrogant and ignorant."
TwoXChromosomes,fgdnf0z,t1_fgcm6aj,1580684437.0,"It helps me to think of abusive relationships  as an addiction- the person must decide themselves that they are ready to ""quit."" You can let the person know that you hope they will end the relationship and that you are willing to help in any way you can but by trying to end it yourself you risk alienating yourself from that person and giving the abuser more power."

labrats,feb04xf,t3_eo97lq,1578954086.0,"I think the method you use is really going to depend on how large the effect is. If this compound completely inhibits differentiation, you should be able to just look at the cells and see that they haven't differentiated. That's where I would start- I'd differentiate under the two conditions, image, and compare them to the undifferentiated control. 

Counting the cells that have adhered to the bottom of the wells is also a good method- I'd do both. If you don't see any difference at this point, you can break out the antibodies."

labrats,fcyhtar,t1_fcygznc,1578080411.0,"We often run negative controls to look at things like background antibody binding in ChIP experiments and because there's (hopefully) no contamination, you don't get any product in the end to sequence. I know the kits themselves are expensive, but you won't have to spend anything actually sequencing your negative control. 

Then again, if you get clean stocks and are careful, it really shouldn't be necessary."
