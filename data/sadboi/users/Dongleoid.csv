Now I'm on Olanzapine. I don't like them that much. They definitely help with psychotic episodes but the side effects suck. Weight gain, sleepiness and a lack of energy are annoying. Do I need them? yeah. Hallucinations suck and psychosis sucks. But the meds help in that regard. So overall, I guess antipsychotics help. Just the side effects I wish I could live without."
