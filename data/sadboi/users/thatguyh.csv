researchchemicals,fpkbijj,t1_fpkb0wq,1588691647.0,"The 3-4 day pyrazolam binge then 2 weeks later I got the gram of etizolam. I went through nearly all of it thinking it was bunk, got another 2gs of etizolam just before I ran out of the first gram. I’d say it’s been 2 weeks with the high doses of etizolam ranging from 10-80mg in a day.

Update: just checked it’s been 13 days since I got my first gram of etizolam."

benzorecovery,fp7nx0c,t1_fp7nc8c,1588374231.0,I’m aware and the seizures are my biggest fear in all this. I have plenty of Benzos to taper but if it gets bad I will go to the ER.

researchchemicals,fp7fudc,t1_fp7bi94,1588369836.0,"Thank you. I don’t think my tolerance is as high as I thought, it was just I was binging so hard it just got that high during the binge. I took 4mg today and actually feel it. Will still taper of course

Appreciate the input."
benzorecovery,fp7fhx2,t1_fp7aoiq,1588369653.0,"Dropped down to 4mg of etizolam today and I actually feel it. 

I now realize my tolerance was so high because I kept redosing non stop. 

Gonna continue 4mg every 6-8 hours and see how I feel. Right now I am only slightly anxious but can definitely tell the 4mg is working. I don’t think I’m as fucked as I thought I was."

researchchemicals,fp72axn,t1_fp71mtw,1588362751.0,"Tapering with etizolam isn’t an option? 

Last time I tried going to a doctor to taper off Benzos they told me my addiction was all in my head and that I was just depressed. I’m so so so so so fucking tired of this"
researchchemicals,fp720a8,t1_fp718sd,1588362602.0,"The goal is to avoid Benzos from now on. My main question was if I need to taper. 

I was originally prescribed Zoloft but ended up not taking due to what happened last time I was on an SSRI (Lexapro) where I nearly took my own life. I will no longer be taking the Wellbutrin for sure. Do you really think I should try the Zoloft? Just after my experience with Lexapro I’m terrified of any meds like that. 

Benzos have ruined my life already, I was still recovering from my last relapse 8 months ago when this all started. I just want out, I can’t believe what I’ve done to myself."

Opioid_RCs,fm9rr1v,t1_fm9rn25,1585875089.0,I haven’t taken kratom in 3 days but have been using ODSMT at high doses since. Should I just save what I have left for a few days and then try again at a lower dose?
Opioid_RCs,fm9qz0o,t1_fm57n0q,1585874590.0,I don’t understand how my tolerance is so fucked. I take 15mg of kratom a day with some days off and I’m needing 400mg of O-DSMT plugged for the strength I’m looking for. Super upsetting tbh I was really hoping I’d be good at 100mg plugged.
researchchemicals,fm34rwr,t1_fm33ym1,1585712860.0,This is definitely the highest my tolerance has been but I’ve gone awhile off kratom after months of daily use at 10-15gs. Guess I’ll find out if I get any withdrawals soon. I’ll let you know. Praying I’m an immune weirdo to the withdrawals lol
researchchemicals,fm32w5x,t1_fm2x63b,1585711490.0,"For some reason even with my high dose of daily kratom use everytime I stop I don’t experience withdrawals as I should.

researchchemicals,fm0qbkz,t3_fsdfdv,1585664023.0,"Every time I take 4homet with this darker brown batch I currently have, my skin feels extremely uncomfortable, tingling and vasoconstriction that lasts for HOURS after effects wear off. It actually physically hurts me at times during the experience. 

I’ve had another batch that didn’t do this at all that that was a much lighter tan color if I remember correctly. 

My last 4homet trip was one of my worst trips ever at only 35mg. Full on open eyed and closed eye entities and visions of what I perceived as people’s genitals being mutilated and limbs ripped apart one by one... + the physical side effects I mentioned. I’ve tripped over 100 times on various psychedelics and I’ve never experience something so dark and sinister. 

I really don’t know man... could be that you just had an uncomfortable experience. It happens sometimes."

Unfortunately because of all this coronavirus shit, usps didn’t find time to deliver to my building today. Gonna have to pick it up from the post office tomorrow morning. 

Luckily I did find my oral syringe so I think I’m just gonna boof that shit yerrrr

I’ll definitely allergy test a smaller amount then redose with my proper amount. Safety first, especially with opiates."

just because you’re blacked out does not mean you’re sleeping. Benzos don’t even make me tired anymore, it really sucks. Still helps me calm down after any drug I use.

got so confused with who I was, who my fiancé was. Very intense entity contact that seemed to be sinister demonic beings who showed me the sickest most twisted torture, like body parts being wripped apart, limb by limb torn off all in a way the flowed together to create the ultimate psychedelic bestgore video... truly traumatized me for a bit and I’m still shaken up thinking back. 

HORRIBLE lingering body load that lasted well past the visuals died off. every time before this with 4homet was great. Set and setting"

I could just tell him I’m down to 1 10mg Valium dose every 2-3 days.

The only reason I started using diclaz was because I started using my Xanax prescription daily then when I ran out started getting from friends. I read that diclaz was best to taper with but I couldn’t do it on my own.
