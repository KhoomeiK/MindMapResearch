MyChemicalRomance,fqnhj3m,t3_gjubff,1589494957.0,A big mood
CPTSD,fqjuygn,t3_gja9l0,1589415572.0,"I just thought this same thing the other night too, while reading Pete Walker’s website. The ways to handle a flashback include “remember you are safe”. I am not. So what now? Guess I will never know lol"
MadeOfStyrofoam,fqckuo3,t1_fqc63qw,1589260905.0,"Tacking on some other advice that I learned while healing a skin graft: if you’re able, soak it to get your clothing/bandages loose if they get stuck. Run under water/hold a wet rag on it and it should come off much easier and not open stuff up too badly."
sticknpokes,fptwvvq,t3_gf42ee,1588899895.0,This is rad af
MyChemicalRomance,fpnn2s5,t1_fpnlp2v,1588767886.0,"Sure, DM is perfectly fine! & I don’t believe that Lola should be treated like a celeb. If they’re not Gerard, it’s rude to hope that they are and overshadow the real person. If they are Gerard, you’re taking away his “anonymous” outlet to exist on twitter without too much fawning. Most likely the reason he left Twitter in the first place, among other reasons."
MyChemicalRomance,fpniven,t1_fpnikl0,1588764354.0,I always just saw Lola as a sort of character that Gerard made around Hesitant Alien times. But I don’t know much about them. They weren’t created to be an extension of Gerard - at least not that we were told. But they are very nice and cool whoever they are :)
MyChemicalRomance,fpni622,t1_fpni0t0,1588763697.0,"Exactly. They still are and always will be separate in my mind. I’m not that convinced Gerard is the main person behind it, if he’s even behind it at all. Nor do I care really. Seems disrespectful in my mind to equate the two or try to get attention from Lola because they may be Gerard."
MyChemicalRomance,fpngxgz,t1_fpn0gdl,1588762500.0,"How did he blow his cover, may I ask? I’ve never heard anyone say it before. Also, if Lola is gerard at least some of the time, it’s clear he doesn’t want anybody to know that. Lola should be regarded as a wholly different person."
EDanonymemes,fpm3n71,t3_ge56rc,1588724891.0,I scrolled past this while half asleep when I woke up and genuinely thought this was a post on this sub... wtf
OSDD,fpg8y5k,t1_fpg8lk4,1588597439.0,"[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDID/comments/gc0iii/uh_i_got_kicked_out_of_my_dreams_because_of_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) may be the post I’m remembering. Got the subreddit wrong. But it can totally happen! Also don’t be afraid to advocate for yourself and do what’s best for you and your system. If your friend is holding you back, it’s okay to step away."
OSDD,fpg80tm,t3_gd9tkm,1588596766.0,"This can totally be communication with an alter! I just saw someone else (either here or on r/DID) where someone mentioned getting kicked out of dreams as well by head mates. Your friend was not very kind or supportive, and I’m sorry. But you are not invalid at all."
BPDmemes,fpg7upx,t3_gd56sq,1588596640.0,"Ouch, mood"
MadeOfStyrofoam,fp5jxol,t3_gbdbd7,1588332041.0,I’ll let ppl have this interpretation if they promise to leave me alone and let me die lmao
MadeOfStyrofoam,fp5e4l7,t1_fp53jx9,1588325973.0,"I’ll share my reasoning. Personally, the biggest reason was that I’ve tried other places on my body, but nothing replicated the feeling I got from my forearms. Legs too sharp of a feeling, in specific. The other biggest reason was that I didn’t care where I did it, because I expected to be dead and it never have to come up later on. So it didn’t matter to me."
BPD,fp18958,t3_gaoaxf,1588227248.0,Thank you for saying this. I’ve been thinking about making a post about all the toxic behavior being applauded on here. Half of us are talking about how the BPD stigma is wrong - and that we are not monsters or impossible to love. But the other half is posting shit about how they lead someone on for fun and get 20+ comments resonating with it. I’ve seen it a bunch lately.
sticknpokes,foxbvz6,t3_g9s6g0,1588139396.0,I love this
EUGENIACOONEY,fox9p4v,t3_g9xcbf,1588137663.0,"Unfortunately, I’m worried that the reasonable people who truly care about her getting better are leaving because they can’t stand to watch her kill herself anymore. I think the people who are unshakable are the ones who should not be looking at Eugenia’s content, nor are they the kind of people that should be commenting on eugenia’s things. To clarify, I mean pro-Ana accounts and people who are delusional about eugenia’s health."
aestheticrain,fotuflk,t3_g9ir2r,1588066510.0,"I like the feeling of this pic a lot. I learned digital art too a while back and what got me tripped up in the beginning was using too “soft” of brushes on everything. It ended up being a bit too blurry. Challenge yourself to use harsher brush settings, it’s really hard at first. I’d imagine it’s also pretty hard to be precise with brushes on a phone but you did really good with that!"
MadeOfStyrofoam,fot4kkw,t3_g8yqdu,1588044506.0,Oh no I’ve been caught
CoronaVirusPA,fopsqxx,t3_g8rurh,1587970914.0,"Being in the closet and having a family who show you these things off of their Facebook and laugh, or make comments while we are watching the news has convinced me even more that I am not welcome. I applaud Dr. Levine for facing the sea of morons every day, keeping her cool, and doing her job. It’s been truly horrible seeing not only what is said, but how many people are saying it."
MyChemicalRomance,foituxw,t3_g7kk6k,1587796832.0,Wow this is very good!
NoStupidQuestions,foe8gl3,t1_foe8993,1587698167.0,"If you ever want more birds and don’t mind having a fuckton of eggs, raising chickens from babies is the best. They follow you around and sit on your lap and fall asleep and they’re so sweet.  The nicest birds I’ve ever had by far! Our rooster though, complete opposite haha"
NoStupidQuestions,foe8223,t1_foe7uqc,1587697925.0,"We got our ducks as babies and they weren’t mean at all, just didn’t like to be messed with too much. Once you picked them up they chilled. Then once you put them down they’d ruffle their feathers and waddle away like you greatly inconvenienced them. If they’re babies, put them in the sink or bath tub. Ours did zoomies under the water; SO CUTE. Enjoy your new babies! It’s so funny - you’d think geese would be more mean but I guess not!"
NoStupidQuestions,foe4rv5,t1_foe33th,1587696012.0,My family owned alpacas for years. The boys are the fighters. The girls couldn’t give less of a fuck. They’re sort of like our ducks were: hard to get ahold of but chill once you have them.
UnconventionalMakeup,fodbj75,t1_fodb7ql,1587682607.0,Awesome thank you so much for the link!!
UnconventionalMakeup,fodae40,t3_g6us3i,1587682225.0,This is such an amazing look. Where did you get the chain for your nose rings? I’ve been looking for one for forever
Didrama,fo8tlly,t1_fo8t9fw,1587603571.0,"It’s better to accept what someone is saying about their health and the accommodations they need and how things affect them then to call them fake and act like a conspiracy theorist. It’s damaging and rude, whether you’re trying to be or not. It’s ultimately less damaging to keep these kind of speculations to yourself. If you truly care about the well-being of people, you’ll adhere to that."
Didrama,fo8fssv,t3_g6aepz,1587595725.0,"Well this was rude, misguided, and unnecessary. You can feel what you feel, but making claims like this is hurtful and unfair, especially when you don’t have access to their medical records. Nin seems very legitimate to me. I suggest you find something more positive to focus your time and attention on."
powerwashingporn,fny6uvs,t1_fny6tu2,1587354864.0,"Don’t worry, we got it after!"
DID,fnuqay1,t3_g3zayv,1587268338.0,"[This](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10zhMhL-Wqz_cduXT4EmpR7tWMi-pH-UCGBPLVgVsz-0/mobilebasic?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) resource helped me for when I was in your same shoes. The most important item in bold, which is: If you were faking, you’d be able to stop. And why wouldn’t you want to? You’re so distressed it’s making you sick. You want it to stop. I’m sure you’ve tried to make it stop. But here you are, you’re still feeling this way. Fakers can stop. Being upset about the idea of faking it isn’t something fakers do. The sentiment “you’d know if you were faking” never helped me, but this one did. I hope that this can help you a little. But what really helped was truly trying to distract myself away from the problem for a while, which you should also do. Like another poster said, you have all the time in the world to figure this out. And I know it feels so big and so confusing that you want it over with, but it’s okay for it to take some time. Best of luck."
