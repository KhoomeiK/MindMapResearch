I would suggest something similar for you. As soon as she crosses a line, put up the boundary. Let her walk home. Let her have a fit. Stand your ground. It may make your kids cry, but it will also teach them that they are allowed to say no to hugs, to say no to being bullied, to say no to manipulation.
