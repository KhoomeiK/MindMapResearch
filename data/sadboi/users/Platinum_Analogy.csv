I didn’t think much of it because it felt nice but I realized it was the wobbles but I was curious as to why I got them from a standard dose. It intrigued me
kratom,fr22ey5,t3_glztg4,1589829991.0,"I got them the other day, I can say its similar to being drunk. When I took my dose of kratom it was just one teaspoon so maybe around ~2.6 grams. I started to feel buzzed, like an alcohol buzz in through my body, my visual perception felt slow sort of as if I had drank 5 shots of hard liquor. I noticed the effects and they seemed nice to me but I realized my eyes had trouble focusing. I felt somewhat dizzy and had some  “vertigo” as my hand eye coordination was off. I could still drive but I knew I wasn’t sober but it wasn’t as bad as people made it seem to be. Basically you feel drunk, visual perception is slow, if you were to move your head from one side of the room to the other, you would defiantly notice your vision lagging behind your other senses."

You understand the struggles and difficulties that come from this situation and I will be getting my grades and you’re completely right. I will be disappointed but you just let me see another light to this situation. I have to thank you for sending such a well thought out message. It really did hit me so close and I screenshotted it because I know my brain would forget it and I want to look back at it when I go through my photos (which i constantly do idk why) and it’ll be there to remind me of what i can achieve and the person i want to become."

I know I have extreme anxiety but it’s severely impacting my academics, all the zoom meetings I have missed. 
Thank you for sharing because I honestly felt like I was just the only one, who tries and tries but just physically and mentally can’t. I always kept telling myself it’s just me, I have a fucking issue and that I’m such a failure. But now I understand it is the anxiety and I think it is time for me to seek help because I was supposed to transfer after 2 years, yet failed so many classes and shit.
I don’t even know what to do about the fucking class. They’ll drop me I’m sure.

Form what my professors have told me, I’m in California so it may be different, however with everything in regards to COVID-19 and remote instruction, all F grades will confer to Excused Withdrawals meaning they won’t hurt GPA or academics as it’ll show as an Emergency Excused Withdrawal due to the panic this crisis has caused..
That doesn’t really help me though. I’m still failing every class whether it’s face to face or online. I just feel like I can’t succeed in life with this fucking anxiety. Or ADHD or whatever is fucking wrong with me."

Weed helped me with my appetite, it made me eat. But after everything, it’s just making it worse 

My last, longest, and most horrific attack came on Thursday morning at 2:30am and I didn’t stop vomiting until Friday morning 9am. That was the day I felt like I was truly about to die. with my popped out ribs from the horrific contractions, sore abs and everyone I knew commented about how skinny I was getting, assuming I was abusing substances.

Quitting Cold Turkey was something U just had to do. After that episode, I don’t want to be like that anymore. That moment when you feel like you’re about to die... The worst feeling in the world just knowing everyone has to watch you throw up, everyone feeling sorry for you. That’s not what I want.

I haven’t been able to sleep, I’ve barely eaten without throwing up. I am constantly bored, time goes by so slow. I have no motivation for nothing, I’m just here. Waiting. Passing. And I think about taking a hit off my own but I know the second that I do, every hit of effort I’ve made to stop would be down the gutter.

Your sister has done you hell in the past, and you did something just as awful that would hurt her if she found out. The only right you can do is to stop whatever chemistry is going on and to tell him, that this can not longer happen. 

What you’re trying to do is show him that cheating is NOT okay, and that what you and him did was a one time thing and was a lesson for the both of you. For you to admit your guilt and for him to realize that he did in fact cheat. 
But or-course you can’t tell your sister, which is why you talk to each other and end it there so you both learn not to do it again, which would help alleviate the strain of your guilt. 

Don’t tell her, but make it right by doing the right decision. By enforcing that cheating is not okay and that what you guys did can’t happen again.

Who could possibly be going through something like me. Then you realize, the whole world is full of narcissistic people. It’s very common these days. Especially Gen Z, our generation. 

I have made stupid decisions like, financially supporting my ex for months, helping him get one car before signing my name fully into another car for him. He drained my money, emotionally abused me and cheated on me daily. Compulsive lying, the excuses, the days he wouldn’t come home. Love bombing, gas lighting, pure manipulation. I honestly thought I was going crazy at one point. I thought what we had was love.. I thought I was happy. Then I realized it was not love it was codependency. The sex was the best however, but that’s what draws you in. It was too toxic that my mental health went to shit. I don’t got much self worth in me. I stayed way too long for the relationship and the universe decided to throw him in jail (he had a warrant I didn’t know about) and then decided to deport him so I had no real way of getting back to him. I realized what the Universe was showing me. This is not what I deserved and I knew that. I was too good for him. Maybe you’re the same way, you’re too good for people who don’t respect you the same way... 
Your body is fragile, needs time to heal. Be sensitive to it. 

You’ve come a long way. Honestly, take a huge look at yourself after the breakup and now. There’s improvement, tremendous improvement. Remember it is OK to feel sad. The sadness does linger but just recognize that your body is healing. There will be episodes where you’re crying and sobbing wanting to get love and affection, there are days where you don’t care about anything, there are days where you WANT to be alone. 
Kratom does help take away the negative energy and thoughts, but it’s also not a miracle. Treat it with respect and you can use it to better yourself, ‘to start some self realization and self worth. I had been feeling suicidal as well after it ended, then felt better before coming to a crash again. I believe these crashes are songs that your body is healing, it just can’t go through it so fast and because of stress and your natural life, it needs time to empty its gas before restarting the healing and fuel again."

I’m mainly for THC for a high, just to separate my mind with the buzz I get from the weed because it helps with the anxiety, makes me less racy with thought loops and stuff. My anxiety is really bad alone, not smoking or vaping or anything makes me have anxiety attacks everywhere"
kratom,f82fkfa,t1_f820ka4,1574190239.0,"I do know vaping and smoking can cause nausea and maybe the two together didn’t work. I could have just been anxious from the weed alone but I’m a heavy smoker so cannabis is usually my best friend.  The thing is usaully, my anxiety is so bad I need a buzz to get rid of the thoughts just so I can focus on something else. Cannabis comes into play, but when I start taking kratom
and stuff I feel anxious about the powder and my stomach since I’m prone to nausea and acid reflux.."
kratom,f82fbv4,t1_f822dm7,1574190106.0,"See, now this is something I’ve tried to do before but it depends on the consistency of the liquid after adding the kratom. If it’s fully dissolved in warm (I mainly messed up using room temperature water) then maybe I be able to get it down without any issues, however I have GERD acid reflux and I get nauseous way too easily from my stomach acid alone. I feel like I just don’t do well in general with stuff like this?"
kratom,f82f3so,t1_f8274bn,1574189983.0,"I haven’t heard of the tea method. Is it where you dissolve the kratom into your tea? I have trouble tossing n washing, as soon as powder gets in my mouth or tongue, it creates insane nausea and I’m prone to acid reflux so my nausea is really bad with my anxiety. I stick to caps to ensure I don’t feel it at all in my mouth. I want to try however It’s just pretty rough to figure out what helps or hurts my stomach"

You’re killing yourself everyday bc you love him but emotionally you’re being abused. You’ll reach your breaking point when he finally gets arrested and deported leaving a financial situation all on your hands, yet after all that shit you still love him deeply... Just run. Now."
Drugs,exi4uq2,t1_exh24l1,1566321109.0,"Please don’t make the same mistake I did. I’m still in love with my boyfriend, but guess what. He got arrested last week for parole violation and will either serve a couple years in jail or be able to walk away on parole again, but have to possibly be deported as he’s not a citizen and overstayed his visa. 
I met him a year ago and he was the most sweetest thing to me. I felt attracted and soon after we were together. Friday marked a year of us being together and we’ve been through some ups and downs due to his life.
This is what happens when you fall in love with the wrong person.
I fell in love with a felon, illegal immigrant, a cheater, parole violator, and violent person.
Though he was never violent to me, I did see his behavior towards others. I wanted to get him to become slightly better but I’ve realized after all this, you will never be able to change someone no matter how badly you want them too. Please don’t fall in love with a person you know will bring you down. Don’t justify their actions or your relationship out of love. Stick to reality. 
I’ve learnt from this pain. I knew deep down what I was getting myself into with his criminal past, and I chose to ignore my red flags."
askgaybros,exhhfd3,t1_exhgc5s,1566305228.0,"Well I’ve never seen him get professionally diagnosed, I just know he’s had sex since he was a very young child and has had sex a lot throughout his life. Like a ton. When he went to jail and he didn’t do much for 277 days and had to resist his sexual urge and stick to masturbation which he could only do at night and in a certain position that wouldn’t make much noise. When he got out he started having sex again but honestly, it’s to the point where he has to bust a nut every morning because if not, his body gets horny and he won’t stop being hard throughout the day, he gets easily irritable and extremely violent. I think his sexual drive is connected to his moms death and the void he feels. He always talks about wanting to not be sober and he wants to feel something all the time because sober isn’t good for him. He will get violent and he will hurt people which he has seem a psychiatrist for his issues but he no longer has access to that psychiatrist and hasn’t been able to get the help he needs or the time to get the help. Not sure what it is but I know his sexual drive is insanely high and he just doesn’t like to stay sober as it reminds him of the darkness surrounding his brain about his moms death and the depression that followed."
askgaybros,exhfsgk,t1_exhf7n1,1566303872.0,You’re definitely right and Im honestly just using my love for him to justify his actions when they clearly aren’t justifiable and a result from his lack of care and lack of action. I just feel so...  lost
