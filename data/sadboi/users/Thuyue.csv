It is only a theory of mine so ofc i could be wrong, but from a logical standpoint I think it could be possible. If All Might and Deku would have quirks before, then the OFA quirk perhaps would have needed more time in developing, because it would have absorbed more quirk imprints.

BokuNoMetaAcademia,fr2ffgd,t1_fr27f4j,1589836347.0,"Haha no problem. I would never sue you for a opinion. In fact i agree that Mirio is way more buff than Izuku. Izuku started to train his body after he impressed All Might, so basically he is training for about 2 years (he was 14 when he met All Might). Mirio on the other hand probably trained since he was a child. The reason why i think Mirio would have a harder time is because his quirk in itself is already complex. Having another quirk always needs a lot of thought and ability of fast processing. Ofc Multiple processing can be achieved over time by anyone, but i think that Izuku has a advantage due him able to focus on OFA instead on another quirk. Also even though OFA seems simple, it is actually way more complicated. And I'm not talking about its >!Secret Quirk Imprints!<. OFA needs to be used carefully. As stated by Izuku (when he got his Air Force Gloves), controlling the Quirk output is not only important to avoiding self-harm or harming others, but also important to restrict certain body areas and parts wasting energy. The management and thought requirements are therefore somewhat similar to Permeation. For example: One could move with 100%  to dodge while only punching with 10% for non-lethal attacks. The balancing and controlling of the Quirk therefore needs to be used carefully to avoid disadvantages in battle or rescue. Imagine fighting a villain, but being unable to balance the Quirk through out the body. One would probably either inflict to small damage on the enemy to avoid blasting rescue rargets or create to much force in the fight blasting off the rescue target. So Punching with 100% while avoiding moving at 100% so that unnecessary wind gusts are not created."

Back to the topic. Yes you said that she explicitly saw parasitic cells being intermingled with Shinichi.

>She saw that parasyte cells were intermingled with his and that he wasn't purely human anymore.

This statement here was the thing i disagreed with. She did not saw that parasitic cells were intermingled with Shinichi nor that he was no human anymore. She only felt a inhumane presence (due the brainwave length of Migi inside Shinichi's blood system). That's why she questioned him of why he felt so different and whether he was a human or not. It was not in her ability to pinpoint that Shinichi was indeed inpure. She just felt the possibility and thus asked him."
Parasyte,fqwm5mz,t1_fqwljl5,1589709584.0,"Yes and No. Migi explained that she can sense the brainwave lengths. Nothing more and nothing less. Neither can she identify the difference between parasite nor does she know that stronger brain wavelengths are emitted from parasites. That's why she ran into the her demise in the first place. She did not believe Shinichi's story and also thought that her feeling would always indicate the advent of Shinichi. If she really could have accurately pinpointed that the inhuman feeling she had from Shinichi was caused by a parasite, then she wouldn't have questioned him in the first place nor would she had downplayed the seriousness of Shinichi's story the eye that we as the viewers have sawn was a parasite, but for Kana who has no information what so ever about parasites nor the fact that her ""feeling"" was caused by her ability of sensing brainwave lengths.

Fact is she did sense the inhumanity and mystery from Shinichi due parasitic brainwaves of Migi. However she was not able to pinpoint that her weird feeling was caused by a parasitic super alien that was starting to fuse with Shinichi."

Demiurge and Aureole Omega could be a interesting combination.

His ability of spawning masses of Demons in combination with Aureole Omegas Buff ability and the Flames of Gehenna could quickly create a huge strong army that may force the enemy to expend their skills and mana. With the right tactics, he could divide the enemy group, taking them out on a later part. His intelligence should be not underestimated.

However looking on the other hand, it's not like there are no beings that could not react with countermeasures. While Albedo and PA have a hard time to see through the intentions of Demiurge, it is not impossible for them. And there is no guarentee for Demiurge's success. He could pull off a lot of tricks, but his army overall (even with buffs of Aureole Omega) is still weak in comparison to all Guardians.

It would be wrong to just call him dumb, because he is clearly disabled and simply cannot understand the whole complexity of the world and its logic.

Remedios isn't that dumb. Just a fckin young woman who never grew up enough and being spoiled by her queen and her own talents. Now, where she is facing humiliation and suffering, she may throw her tantrums and make stupid decisions. However from a logical standpoint, earlier or later she should be able to look past the thingd and finally grow up. I could give her to much credit, but her paranoia has already led her to come right conclusions, even though they weren't explained logically, having the paranoia and the ability to question things that are seemingly real gives a person a lot of growth potential in terms of intellegence. 

PDL on the other hand is another matter. He is not uneducated, young and spoiled like Remedios and Philip. Yes, he is a Dragon Lord, which are said to be ignorant due their strength.

I mean there a Superman characters left and right that can literally sneeze planets aways, meanwhile ignoring physical and logical laws. I mean all fiction ignore some logic, but DC is like ""Bruh im gonna completely erase logic and create my own based on new theoretical logics"". The high complexity of strength and feats in the characters just feels like watching a battle of gods on steroids instead of looking a classical heroes vs. villains. Is there any point to match other fictional characters with them? Can anyone here tell me another franchise were some humans are a boss in everything?

Sorry for the rant. I do not intend to insult the fans of DC or DC itself. I'm just tired of watching DC vs other franchises, because DC is almost everytime a pretty obvious win."

overlord,fqnw0jg,t3_gjxrym,1589502513.0,"Hehe PDL indeed fell into the trap, just like ECDL. This chapter also became very interesting and insightful. I just love the thought process and character interactions between the characters of Nazarick. Also this chapter cleared a lot of questions for reader who missed some details. Many readers for example didn't realized at first that PA was Ainz. I for my part forgot the detail that a WCI is the key to surpass wild magic, even though i have read the Vampire Princess Bonus Novel. I have to admit that PDL doesn't have that much of an interesting character as i initially thought, but he isn't necessarily bad. Just not good. He didn't realized the weirdness of Ainz (PA) holding back nor did he realized the strange behaviour of Ainz (PA) kneeling before him and acting weak. PDL believed to have gained essential intel, but in truth Ainz and Nazarick have tricked him and fed him with almost worthless intel, while getting essential intel about PDL. If PDL truly fears Shalltear and Albedo even with his true body, he will not have a chance of victory against a fully prepared Ainz. It was obvious as a reader that Nazarick would eventually came on top, but no one would have expected how Nazarick would secure the upper hand. Not everyone can understand the scheming of the opponent, therefore it becomes essential to understand and question the enemy. Ainz was often a joke for unnecessarily putting to much thought on simple matters, but it is the slight paranoid and highly analytical self reflection that allows Ainz to lead Nazarick into a secured path."
IsekaiQuartet,fqniaok,t1_fqn1vjx,1589495349.0,">what's that supposed to mean ?
please don't say something dumb

The comment before me was stating the fact that the armies of the New world of Overlord aren't bad and that they just seem very weak, because the entities of Nazarick are setting the standard of strength higher. I just added the fact that even without considering Nazarick, the armies of the new world aren't really remarkable or strong due different factors and circumstances. 

I would greatly suggest you to thoroughly read my comment, before coming up with a stupid and disrespectful question."
overlord,fqmml8f,t1_fqmc02y,1589479949.0,"There was a sentence in part 2 that said something like:

*""If Ainz were here, he would do the same""*

Baharuth Empire has a strong, but comparably a small army and the Roble Kingdom is led by Retardios (which says a lot about the military potential and leadership)."

Also one should note that Ainz (Pandora's Actor) does not have much Physical Attack Power like Albedo or Shalltear. It may be strong against Low Level Characters, but a physical hit against PDL armor is not much."

overlord,fqbbryr,t3_ghwsne,1589234102.0,"I think this is the first time that Ainz (PA) didn't flex and instead showed a pathetic side to his opponent just to receive more intel. That is a very interesting approach. I mean Ainz (Satoru) already did downplay himself in the fight against Cure Elim (Bonus Novel Side Story), but this time it really seemed pathetic. However thats why i love it. He just acted that way for simply gaining more intel. If Ainz (PA) would have gone serious, he could have solo'd PDL with his summons. Also a interesting intel, we have received as a reader was about PDL character. I always thought of him as a merciless Dragon Lord who didn't give a f*ck about others as long it didn't affect the fate of the world (Like Yggdrasil players and the Evil deities). However when Ainz (PA) did act as the loosing party, PDL did hesitated out of compassion. Very interesting. One more thing. I just love how Albedo completely flexed on PDL forcing him to retreat. I wonder how she passed through the ""World Separating Wall"".
