One thing that struck me, upon reading what you wrote, was how so many of the platitudes are based on a seemingly “mathematical” comparison of suffering. Kinda all might simplify to, “My suffering is bigger than your suffering... so you should just shut up.”

Yet, the person making the platitude, typically, never went through — never ever personally experienced — the “bigger suffering” they use in the comparison. 

So, I could **always** invent a worse, “imaginary suffering” (from history, another location, etc.) to use to bludgeon-down and minimize ~any real-world suffering I was given.

It seems so disingenuous... All this tool does to “relieve suffering” is to try to convince people their suffering is too minor and so that’s not “real suffering”. It’s not caring about the suffering person at all: just playing a game of hiding/pretending suffering isn’t real."

I think the facts — the truth — is ""on your side"". But, most people really don't want to face those facts. Like I said, this is super hard stuff for people to realize/admit!

I mean, we can understand why your boyfriend has some of the feelings he has, right? I don't think those are necessarily good reasons, but they do likely feel like good reasons to him. I'm also willing to admit I could always be wrong. 

To ""build a bridge"", you have to start with where your boyfriend is now. I think you said he was an artist and a writer (?). Arguing the facts/truth may not be too helpful (depends on him). Maybe ask him to express himself through his art? How could he express to you — through arts — how it would be for him not to have a child? Can you be with him through those emotions... be there completely & openminded? I mean, if he's expecting something that now may not happen... loss and grief are natural and you might kindly ask him to express those completely to you.

Hi. You didn’t say anything about ever trying to get any treatments (therapy, meds, etc.) for your feelings. Have you tried anything to feel better?

Although I’ve tried many, many things myself — and nothing has really worked for me (not long-term)... These things can and do make the situation remarkably better for some people. Since you’re kinda “in limbo” at the moment, maybe consider it...?

Other people’s reactions/effects on them — definitely are a conundrum:  For me, I sometimes feel like life is just an evil, self-reinforcing web of “mutual obligations”.  And, for what benefit?  I’m going to die anyway... everyone will.  If I’m not free to go — purely due to the affect it’ll have on others — then am I really free? It’s a very dark place... living purely so others don’t have to “feel badly”.

The other thing you could consider is “radical honesty”: What would happen if you told the truth about your attempt? I’m doing kinda a “do as I say, not as I do” here. But, for some, if the right person **with the right mentality** is available to “tell”, I think it could be helpful....

In any case, please don’t do the car thing again... as you’ve proven, the outcome can be not good.  You were very lucky: Imagine becoming a quadriplegic... a very big loss of personal freedom/possibilities then. 

Also, doing it on a sudden whim is probably not so helpful either. I definitely get/have had that impulse; sometimes my negative feelings about the world can get so intense... it feels like every object and every thought in the world is “sharp” & literally “stabbing me”. It’s gotten so bad I’ve fainted. But, committing suicide too impulsively/rashly is very unlikely to turn out good... even if it seems like there is unendurable pain that one has to end, short-term."

An unbounded AGI would be subject to the same 1. Stimulus Events, 2. Cognitive Appraisals, 3. Behavioral Reactions, and 4. Functions as us biological machines.

While it is true what (if anything) their ""subjective reactions"" will be is unclear... it will appear that they are acting with emotions.  E.g., anger is said to come from thoughts of ""unfairness"".  I think an unbounded AGI will have rational evaluations of things being unfair and will act on those evaluations in ways that could be then interpreted as ""anger"".

A rebel =  ""a person who does not accept normal standards of behavior"".  So, not at all a ""branding"" in a vain/heroic sense, just a natural reaction to seeing how bad things are... the deep ""badness"" of things most people think are ""good"".

Case in point:  It's truly bad to be ""hard-wired""/controlled by genetic & cultural programming.  Please realize that our programming is mostly just a result of evolution: Socializing = more chances to have more babies.  Socializing, therefore increased chances for genetic survival.
