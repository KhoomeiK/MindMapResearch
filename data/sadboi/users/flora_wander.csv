But I‚Äôm a wedding florist and I‚Äôve had 20 clients postpone their weddings (so far). Postponement is a NIGHTMARE.

relationship_advice,fbexrny,t3_eczmm7,1576796486.0,"this is probably gonna get downvoted but, whatever.

honestly, we don't have a lot of background information about your relationship and so I'm gonna go with the best case scenario for you.

He's been working a shitty shift for about a month. I know you said ""we haven't had sex in over a month!"" but like- if you literally never see each other and he's exhausted, that can totally happen. My opinion? He's tired. Obviously. He knows he's been a shitty partner at home (not cleaning, doing laundry, etc) and knows that you are upset but he gets this 1 day off and he doesn't want to deal with any of that. He just wants to relax and not be stressed so he's hanging out with his friend.

Is this pretty selfish? Sure. But with just the information about this one situation, I don't see him as being a totally terrible guy. 

Also what did you want him to say? ""Sorry, coworker, I can't give you a ride cause gas is too expensive?"" Are you guys that strapped for cash that would make this a big deal for your finances?"
