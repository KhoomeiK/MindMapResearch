On MMM, Midge is charming, talks fast, has a tiny waist, and never not wearing a beautiful outfit - I love her too, but she is someone we are conditioned to love.

Bojack Horseman on Netflix would be another point of comparison, and although the main character is male, it is a lot more similar to CXG in my view. It is a dark comedy, genre-bending, has an often wildly unlovable and frustrating protagonist, and gets into a lot of the same subjects - mental illness, generational trauma, feminism, etc.  Could CXG have done well on Netflix, or do we accept unlikeable men that much more easily than unlikeable women?"
