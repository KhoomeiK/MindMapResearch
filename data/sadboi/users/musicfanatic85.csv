ResearchingDepression,foc6e07,t1_fny16xm,1587667637.0,"I can relate to this. I too feel like a ghost in life and I'm really sorry you have to go through it like this. I want to try something with you. If you're ok with it. I want you to write down every symptom you have. Mental, physical, etc. Before medication section, and after medication section. I can't diagnose you, but I can look at you as a whole from beginning to end. I mean every symptom too. Digestion, lack of sleep, twitches, whatever it may be. List them all.   


Also when you're looking at mood, or wanting to be here or not, love, etc. That's all surface feelings.   


When you have an issue at the core, meaning physical ailments, deficiencies, etc, it affects those surface feelings. So you have to make sure your core is good before you can enjoy those surface feelings. If that makes sense. 

So for example a woman with a copper toxicity is going to feel psychotic and miserable. Eventually hating life, people, and of course have depression.   


Another example would be if a man has low testosterone levels, he may not experience a limp noodle but stuff have low testosterone. He'll also hate life, people, and have depression.

I can't diagnose you, but I can look at everything overall and see if things connect."
ResearchingDepression,foc3o4t,t1_foatcwj,1587666742.0,"The problem with labs is most ranges are wide in everything including thyroid function. What I've read, and what I've been told by scientists and health experts, is that the ranges are wide to keep from overloading the healthcare facilities. This makes sense to me, considering I've seen many people well on the optimal levels rather than typical reference ranges.   


Remember, if you see a doctor, and they say you're fine, yet you read studies that say otherwise, see a different doctor. Not all doctors are created equal. I've been to over 50 doctors in 3 years. To me, 5 of them are worth a damn. The rest of them just float through life.  


I'm not saying anti-depressants are bad, but you have to rule other things out because anti-depressants can mess with you even years after you're off them.   


If you have a thyroid issue, rigid muscles can be a symptom of that, and depression. Definitely check the Free T. Think about the total range itself. 250-990 and sometimes you'll see 250-1100. That's a large range and most doctors will be lazy and say if you're in the middle you're fine."

ResearchingDepression,fo9490e,t1_fnxho3v,1587610186.0,"Hmm, interesting. Thanks for the reply. Have you looked into deficienies at all? If you've had this as a young child, it's possible that your body is lacking, or produces too much of something. It could be any of the B vitamins, copper, zinc, selenium, etc. If you have a deficiency it can make your whole body feel like crap your whole life. If your body feels find, it can make just your mind feel cloudy. Like you mentioned poor concentration, low self esteem, fatigue, etc. Fatigue means you're tired and feel like blah. 

If you can, go see an endocrinologist your area. If it's hormone (low cortisol in the morning, dhea, pregesterone, etc) you feel tired in the morning. Testosterone can also do this but so can vitamins. Call around and find one that has good reviews. If they don't want to dive further into your issues, find another one. I know it sucks and can be a journey but that's where we're at with depression.   


Also low testosterone doesn't mean you can't get erections or sexually aroused. One of my issues is my testosterone is in the toilet on my labs, yet I can still get erections and I have sex drive. But low testosterone also causes depression.   


I would recommend going to an Endo and asking for a full hormone work up. You never know. You can even look up hormone illnesses, or issues, and compare with your symptoms. It doesn't always have to do with taking a brain altering chemical prescription. Sometimes yes, but it might be an issue you can easily fix. See an Endo."

ResearchingDepression,fnxbh2o,t1_fnx5b44,1587335274.0,"Welcome Christian. I appreciate you sharing your story with us. There's definitely more to figuring out what's going on. So i'll ask a few questions first.   


Are you sleeping 6-8 hours a day?   


How's your digestion?  


Is the depression triggered by your situation (relationship, finances, where you live, etc).   


Do you exercise enough?   


What's your diet like?  


Do you have any other symptoms that you have had since or before the depression started? I know it seems like it doesn't relate but if you have, for example, Cushing's disease, and you're focusing on the depression part, the whole thing is treatable which heals the depression.  


Give us all of your symptoms, including the depression.  


Also, remember that the reason anti-depressants work is that the doctor threw the right ones at you. It's not because they understand them and why they'll help you. They're basically throwing darts at you in the dark, and hoping after 4-6 weeks, one of the darts stick. So asking others what meds helped them won't help you necessarily. We're all chemically different. Definitely keep that in mind."
ResearchingDepression,fnxa5m1,t1_fnx1mbr,1587334518.0,"If you suspect it's specifically aimed at low Neurotransmitters, and you feel better on 5htp. Have you tried cornering that area? For example if you have Tryptophan with inflammation, it will go down the IDO pathway which is basically inflammation. So it won't convert to 5htp. But if you're lacking the cofactors such as Zinc, p5p, b3, etc either in between Tryptophan > 5htp or......between 5htp to serotonin, that could also be a problem.

have you looked into the cofactors? Are you getting enough B3, p5p, etc? Definitely something to consider."

ResearchingDepression,fnusnsx,t1_fnulvff,1587270038.0,"All the people you've mentioned, I've read their books. It's really hard to put my finger on most of it. Ross says vitamins are the way based on mood, Walsh says vitamins based on disorder, Lynch says vitamins based on genes. I'm sure they all mean well, but it's hard to pick and choose between them all. Even if some of them have overlapping ideas. But all in all you're right it's all about feeling better and what works for you."
ResearchingDepression,fnt9lky,t1_fnsrtls,1587237273.0,"Yes, but keep in mind that Urine excretion doesn't test what the body is absorbing and what it isn't. That's my issue with it. If you have too much of something that you shouldn't, for example VMA (Catecholamines) that can indicate a tumor, which is good and proven for measurements. But a urine test for B vitamin waste, tells us nothing. That's where I get squirrely.   


Perfect example. Let's say someone has high B6 in their blood. That to me would indicate they're not converting B6 to P5P, so the B6 is staying in their system. because of this they may not excrete B6 in their urine. So if it's low in the urine, does this mean deficiency? IF it does you give them more B6 which will increase their B6 blood even more.   


Do they offer blood tests too? or is it only Urine in the OAT?"
ResearchingDepression,fnqxqb5,t1_fnqx7ll,1587174530.0,"Ah ok. I'm familiar with Genova, and Great Plains, but never had any of these tests done. I'm still skeptical with a lot of their testing since there's no science behind most of their depression measurements. SNPS I'm cool with. There's a lot of research behind those tests, but the amino acids, neurotransmitters, etc. There's no real data yet. Just these two companies that offer testing."

ResearchingDepression,fnpsgmx,t1_fmjx2bl,1587151167.0,"For me right now, my aim is towards a deficiency of some kind (possibly B1), thyroid, histamine, or hormone such as testosterone, progesterone, etc. 

From the studies I've done on William Walsh, he's mentioned that 400mg of SAM-e is the cap. as far as feeling the effects. 

Sorry to hear about your 5htp crash. Have you considered L-Tryptophan instead? I wouln't take both, but I would say try Tryptophan, and it's a slow increase.   


We don't have an official way of measuring neurotransmitters, so that OAT test, I'm not sure how I feel about it. I know a lot of naturopaths use it but to measure the brain chemicals in urine seems a bit extreme. I'm for it as far as testing but seems a bit much."
HumansBeingBros,fmz7wfi,t3_fyc5ck,1586509900.0,I'm excited to see all the comments from people who don't have a clue what this means. Haha.
ResearchingDepression,fmka704,t1_fmk99cb,1586148630.0,"Hey thanks for the comment. Obviously it's worry some to all of us, I'm referring to keeping your mind off of it when I say try not to worry. 

As for anxiety there are obviously different kinds. For example someone who suffers from health anxiety, or hypochondria, wouldn't focus on breathing exercises, they would see a specialist that specializes in hypochondria. We're all going to have anxiety about this virus, that's normal. But if you think you have it from losing your breath for a few minutes, that a different issue altogether.

The thing about anxiety is, there are 100s, maybe 1000s of causes, from a B12 deficiency to a serious illness to behavioral and needing to retrain your thinking process. If it's behavioral it's all about habits and seeing a specialist to help you catch those unhealthy thinking patterns.

If it is overwhelming though, I recommend the tips above. Watching the news and being on social media is probably the worst option someone can do. Either way, I wish you and your family good health during this crazy time. Cheers."

Your body is doing things that you can't explain. Depression is a part of it. We go off on this road researching the depression and don't associate the others symptoms but they all coincide in a big way. Thank you again for sharing your info. 

I would get a second opinion on your thyroid levels being ""in range"". It's a bullshit range. Only the good doctors are up to date and realize this. [Here is a good guide for ranges](https://hypothyroidmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Dr.-Borenstein-optimal-TSH-Free-T4-Free-T3.jpg).

When our thyroid isn't working optimally, we'll gain weight because our metabolism slows down drastically..... so make sure your levels are great and not based on a doctor hurrying you out the door. 

Genesight is great and I've used them. The problem is you haven't been fully checked out by a good doc. What if you have a B1, B6, B12, or any other B deficiency? You'll have awful symptoms that affect your mental health. Same with Vitamin D. Then once we get low in something, a food or multi-vitamin will not fix this. We need higher doses, then we can take that multi-vitamin or food to maintain. 

It happens all the time but unfortunately we don't have that one lab test yet that checks everything mental health related. We should have that, but we're just not there yet. So the only alternative is to have a blood draw for everything. If you have a doctor willing and insurance will cover it. Do it! 

Inflammation is huge so pretty much they should check all the biomarkers for inflammation. [Here's a list but check out Table 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5436791/). Also IDO (inflammation) doesn't allow our tryptophan neurotransmitter to convert into 5htp to serotonin (happy) to melatonin (for sleep). Therefore inflammation equals lack of happy equals lack of sleep. If we have fatigue going on we'll sleep 12 hours or 19 hours. The whole thing is a puzzle.

Black seed oil increases 5htp activity (increases serotonin) and also is a strong anti inflammatory (which would help both but **DO NOT take if you're already on an anti-depressant that increases 5ht**). Speak with a doctor before even considering it. Too much 5ht could be a terrible outcome. Also not recommended if they have diagnosed you with mania or bipolar because it could trigger manic episodes.

But I have spoke with people whose depression magically went away due to Black Seed Oil. But again speak with a doc first because meds don't mix well.  


As you can see the there are soooooooo many options. The obstacles are ridiculous. Ain't nobody got time for that. So i would consider the doctor option and the full examination before the anti-depressant route. But I'm not a doctor and can't tell you what to do. Feel free to mention anything else.   


Also if you have rumination or mind racing, indfullness meditation is life changing.

10 to 20 minutes a day. Evenually an hour a day. It helps out in a big way. Youtube has many guided mindfullness videos."

Now, you mentioned a psychiatrist and you're right; they test and throw pills. Not my first go to for mental decline. 

Not sure if you looked into a therapist yet? 

For one, this will help you get things off your chest because they can determine the conflict in how you see things. (Poor self esteem/body image/panicking because work is Monday). They can even give you ideas for fixing a lot of your bullet points.

Possibly one that uses [EMDR](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/emdr-what-is-it#1). This works wonders for behavior issues. It blurs your reactions associated with memories. So if you have a memory of your parents, ex, or anything that causes mental anguish, EMDR will help blur or cut ties with the association making it less dreadful or overwhelming.

But here is the biggest kicker of it all.....and hear me out. I know this may seem dumb but...

Lacking in nutrients, toxicity, underlying illnesses and many others, can all cause behavior issues. For example, I just spoke to a woman who had thyroid issues. Her doctor told her that her numbers were good but she couldn't work or take care of her kids. She was experiencing psychosis and didn't feel like she couldn't continue with life. It was getting so bad. 

She found a doctor that said; you have hypothyroidism. Your numbers are way off. Gave her some Thyroid hormone with additional T3 hormone. Her light came back on. She felt normal again. 

So I know this might seem like left field but instead of the mental or behavior issues, what physical symptoms are happening with your body? It could be digestion, sleep, body temp, dizziness, fatigue, migraines.

Restlessness and bouncing could be from a potassium or magnesium deficiency (there are other causes of course). These are just a few factors. Have you had a full evaluation from a primary care doctor? Preferably an integrative doctor (but has to be an MD for insurance to consider paying). Integrative doctors see you as a whole picture. DO's see it as the same but don't go as far in depth as Integrative doctors. However, Integrative doctors are considered ""alternative medicine"". Which is bogus because most of the tests they use are available at hospitals we all go to. But because their tests are piecing puzzles together, it's consider unconventional. 

Sorry if that seemed long and confusing. Go on Google. Type in your (city integrative medicine). Look for doctors around or near you that have an MD or DO title in their name. This way there is a better chance your insurance covers it. Then call those places. They are literally everywhere but the insurance issue and the title is the disconnect. It took me years to figure this out. 100's of doctors, insurance people, billing department people. Nobody with depression has time for this shit. But that is the shortcut. If you need help lookin, message me anytime. I will gladly help as best I can.

This is all relevant and the reason I created this page (also why I am making a bad ass mental health website that hasn't existed until now.)"

ResearchingDepression,fepsd4c,t1_fepk7vl,1579329629.0,"Yeah but keep in mind thyroid issues, and even viruses can be passed on at birth. Health is a nightmare overall and it's too large of an area to cover. Mix this with incompetent doctors, and scared/unknowing patients, you get the mess we live in. My goal is to help break things down and provide value so people can figure out their own cause when they feel that medication or doctors have failed them. That's why I strongly believe that suicide should never be an answer. If years of medications didn't help and that was the only option, it makes sense to give up. But I've read so many studies in all aspects of health that can contribute to someone's depression, there are just far too many things to consider and the health system is so unorganized there needs to be a base and I'm creating that base.  


Also, monolaurin is a lot more potent than coconut oil. Just an FYI. It helped me get rid of that physical and mental fatigue. Something to consider."
ResearchingDepression,fepjefe,t1_fepj8h8,1579322031.0,"Definitely. I see, yeah lack of mental energy can be miserable. I'm turning this reddit into a website to help reach a larger audience. Lots of thanks came through, so i felt I was on to something. Definitely keep in touch. All the best."
ResearchingDepression,fepi1da,t1_fepb7zw,1579321025.0,"Good luck dude. I completely have lived your side of it, however thinking it's a con is a form of giving up. My belief and even with sources to back it, there are 1,000s of causes of depression. So we have to trial and elimination. It's a pain in the dick but that's how it is. Another thing to look into is Epstein Barr Virus. If your loss of energy is due to that, some monolaurin supplements would help with that. Basically coconut oil extract. Helped me big time. Good luck."
ResearchingDepression,fep5gbb,t1_fep510q,1579312551.0,Well I'd definitely consider Julia Ross' advice as solid. She started as an addiction specialist. She's a pretty bright star. It does work fast though because I have a friend who had a bad reaction to it and it was within 15 minutes. She's a medical scientist and she'll never take it again. Apparently she's dominant in Serotonin so.. But we're not sure if it was serotonin syndrome she experienced but it can work fast for sure.
ResearchingDepression,fep2buy,t1_fep18wy,1579310561.0,"Yeah, it definitely came on suddenly. It started with super high anxiety. The reason doctors can't ever catch it for most is that the ref ranges at doctors' offices are entirely too large. So, for instance, the range might be a 0.5 - 4.5 range for TSH. So if you're a 0.6 you're good and if you're a 4.4 you're good. So it's based on the number rather than how you feel. There are many studies that show ""optimal"" ranges over ""standard"" ranges.   


Pardon my language, but it's a complete mindfuck. Especially when you're not supposed to know any of this...the doctor is. So as a patient you're supposed to just trust the doctor. I've been to over 40 doctors in 3 years and had over 100's of labs to get to this place. 

My symptoms were anxiety, depression, constipation/diarrhea, freezing hands, feet, dizziness, brain fog, drop-in oral temperature. So it seems to be a mix of hypothyroidism and insulin resistance. Basically I'm creating more insulin than I should. So I'm taking Berberine (an alkaloid found in plants) that is helping tremendously so far for the insulin resistance and I started thyroid medication recently for the thyroid. Still in the process of getting the correct dose."
ResearchingDepression,fep0qix,t1_feozxi1,1579309556.0,"I completely understand and a great answer. yeah, it's hard to single one out but usually, you're able to see quick benefits or/no benefit from 5htp or tyrosine supplements. My depression from what I can gather has stemmed from the thyroid. It's been a long 3-4 years but I'm finally getting answers. I'm sure there are other factors but that seems to be my biggest issue as of right now. It's hard to get these things locked down on the radar so if you're unaware, guessing turns into a cruel game.   


The reason I brought up inflammation, was because if you have seen benefits from 5htp, i'm curious how you would benefit from something like Black Seed Oil. It significantly reduces inflammation but brings up your 5-ht levels and there are many studies that support this. So if your issue did stem from inflammation (which we all have to some degree) it might be a win/win for you. That was why I asked."
jerky,feov3rn,t3_epuz0x,1579306075.0,Damn that looks good.
ResearchingDepression,feooy35,t3_epvay6,1579303315.0,"Thank you for your kind words. This is the exact reason why I created this subreddit. Thank you for sharing your experience. So out of all of the supplements that you've tried, which one seemed to help the most so far? The gut/brain link is super important, so I'm sure those probiotics are treating you much better. 90% or more of serotonin is created in the gut. Have you done anything with inflammation at all yet? You're the first person aside from myself to post on here. So it's great to see someone other than myself talking about benefits. Again I appreciate your post."
