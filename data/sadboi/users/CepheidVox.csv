aspd,fq6eo9b,t3_ggxp92,1589130063.0,"I'm diagnosed with BPD, and I'll respond since you're looking for a broader set of answers.

1. I never tortured bugs or other animals. I did do a lot of watching and following them, though. I think I displayed above-average compassion for living creatures as a kid. Even now, I never kill bugs, always capture and release, and I take the time to throw worms back into the grass when I see them on the sidewalk.

2. This is a hard question to answer because I have few memories of childhood (caused by BPD and trauma). I did start having severe panic attacks around age 13, though, which is also when I stopped believing in my family's religion. Death definitely terrified me because it was so uncertain and I didn't want to be obliterated.

3. a) I often feel lonely. I feel fundamentally different from other people and I have trouble reaching out to others. I also require a lot more attention than most people to actually feel loved, and I can't expect others to accommodate that. Most days I can navigate this loneliness just fine, but other days it fills me with a terrible, almost physically crippling pain. I cope with this by using skills I learned in dialectical behaviour therapy and reaching out despite the desire to completely isolate myself.
b) I actually love being alone in a big crowd. I tend to absorb the emotional current of the group and it can feel really invigorating. It makes me feel anonymous and therefore I can ignore my own lack of identity.

4. Romantic relationships are complicated for me; I can't easily separate love, friendship, and sexual attraction. Liking a person is a yes/no switch for me and I tend to flip that switch a lot. I was about 13 when I first had a crush, and it was on someone who was bullying me. I think I felt a strong desire to convince him to be nice to me. Later crushes were more focused on idealizing people who showed me basic kindness. Now when I pursue people, I'm just looking for genuine connections based on mutual admiration.

5. I don't hate society; I think it has issues, but things are slowly improving. I live in a multicultural society, but I've definitely mostly interacted with people who are similar to me.

6. I'd rather not go into specifics, but sexuality and violence are linked for me due to early childhood sexual abuse. I have some weird kinks I'd rather not have, but I'm working through them in therapy and that's helping a little.

What are you hoping to learn from these questions?"

ABA,forfl7e,t3_g94ute,1588011389.0,"I've seen a lot of that on tumblr under the same tags. It's likely there are some people practicing ABA who aren't doing so ethically.

I think following ethical guidelines is the most important part of ABA practice, but also the part that is most subject to behavioural drift. People sometimes forget that their client is the person whose behaviour they are analyzing and not their parents, teachers, or other caretakers. It's really important to consider whether a treatment is actually needed, whether it will be beneficial for that person and not just for their guardians, and whether there is a less intrusive way to achieve the same goals. We make the environment work for the person and not the other way around whenever possible."

Specifically, that's derealization, where the world takes on an unusual feeling of unreality and other people appear mechanical. There is also depersonalization, where you might feel like you are acting without control or not real or capable of emotions.

r/dpdr has a bunch of info on it. Everyone experiences dissociation to some degree, but it can also become a disorder of it's own or be caused by another disorder and become a bigger problem. I have BPD, so I experience it pretty often."

personalitydisorders,fo5i947,t1_fo5f2p3,1587526292.0,"There isn't a lot of data on this subject, so it's very hard to say. I did manage to find [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2044500/) from 2007 that looked into comorbidity in the PDs. According to their survey, the least common comorbidity was between STPD and DPD, followed by DPD and ASPD, and then DPD and SZPD. This makes sense due to the higher rates of social isolation associated with those three diagnoses.

According to this same study, BPD is most likely to be comorbid with DPD or PPD. NPD wasn't studied in this paper (neither was HPD). BPD has been studied pretty extensively and I've also read that it's highly likely to be comorbid with AVPD. According to this study, BPD and ASPD are not especially likely to be comorbid.

It is very important to note that the DSM5 came out in 2013, and the diagnostic criteria have changed for many of these disorders (in part because of the high comorbidity between the PDs), so this data represents the old classifications, not the new ones. There is also a trend towards seeing the PDs as as a spectrum rather than as discreet categories."
