Needafriend,eys5lvx,t1_eys1xv4,1567387790.0,Tbh I’m done with talking.
Needafriend,eys1dp0,t1_eys19g5,1567384272.0,I need to get outta this town and away from these people. I just want a fresh new start. As for the safety part I am in fear of myself and don’t want to be left alone so others are the least of my worries.
Fencesitter,exdw067,t1_exdvtok,1566188516.0,I do have access I’m just waiting for a call who h might never come. It’s frustrating. Another thing I worry about is whether or not I can even bear children. I’m too scared to find out. I know things might change later about everything but it’s just unsettling to know I’m unsure about it.
Fencesitter,exdu3gi,t1_exdtnou,1566186764.0,Tbh I can’t tell. Both thoughts give me anxiety. It’s a whole lot of responsibility and not saying I’m not ready for it but he said he regrets having his kid with her and so young like they did. He loves his son to death but that statement made me wonder if I’d feel that way and if I did would I be a bad person? Once you have a child it’s tied to you for life. What if things don’t work out with me and my partner? I feel I have so much love to give a child and I have such a motherly instinct and I imagine how I want to raise my children. Either way I am no position to be ready financially but I also know tons of parents who weren’t and they find a way. I don’t want to miss out on the experience but what if it’s not exactly what I expect it to be? I have BPD and I feel it has a lot to do with my inability to make choices cuz I over analyze everything. It’s just exhausting.
Fencesitter,exdtoqh,t1_exdtjew,1566186406.0,This is a little of what I’m going through and I feel like I worry about it too much. But because of society. What if I’m different? But what if I regret it when it’s too late? Ugh!!!!
Fencesitter,exdt8ax,t1_exdstpp,1566186006.0,Yes. I mean he is going through something that is difficult for him and he just doesn’t wanna have to deal with it again. I always loved the idea of it all but as I grow older I am starting to believe that it’s all dead or dying. I’ve explained to people that it’s all a social construct that is socially excepted and therefore considered to be stigmatized. Part of me still wants it all but does any of it really make a difference??
Fencesitter,exdsku3,t1_exds7v5,1566185450.0,That’s the point. Idk what I want. In both decisions there are pros and cons but I wonder if I would regret whichever decision I choose later on in life.
childfree,exdqawe,t1_exdphxo,1566183597.0,I know it isn’t but I feel a bit obligated. Growing up I had a teacher who never had children and I thought it was sad. Now here I am wondering if I’ll follow that. If it makes me feel any less of a woman.
BorderlinePDisorder,ewu24eo,t3_cpu273,1565761375.0,"I felt this way. I decided at the beginning of this year that I NEEDED something to live for. after getting a cat I felt better then my depression got outta control and I started to not care, then I started to stay away from home cuz I worked too much (to stay distracted)  and then he ran away..... I hate life."
depression,ewu0c9b,t3_cpvwhh,1565759523.0,you arent alone. Same here and thank you for showing me that I'm not fake. I always read these posts and think hmm well maybe I'm not depressed. I feel it thought and the worse part is I am open to talk with people that are willing to listen and they think Im lying because I don't seem depressed. I wish they could understand and better I wish they would help me.
depression,evx3sp4,t3_cj4crn,1564881074.0,This is exactly how I’m tired of feeling. You understand. I can’t keep living like this anymore.

Needafriend,eu9loan,t3_cfbdmm,1563583965.0,I would say yes! Ask him about it and dont be afraid to voice your concern. If he doesnt wanna get serious with you then you dont need him. Dont leave yourself in the dark and wondering cuz you dont deserve that.
depression,eu9lfvv,t3_cfb88l,1563583778.0,"So very proud of you, and also excited for your new lifestyle routine!! Working out has really worked wonders for me and my depression when I was stuck in a slump. I hope you have the same effect. I hear it doesn't work for everyone but I dont really see why not? It releases those feel good endorphins."
depression,etkj9me,t1_etkj8fw,1562899473.0,Same here.
depression,esvu8pk,t3_c9a9lj,1562304208.0,I wonder this all the time like how are they okay? how else should I be feeling?
depression,esukfbr,t3_c8yh8u,1562284857.0,"I am at work reading this and I am almost in tears. Especially the part where you said ""I feel like someone needed to hear this"" that person is me. I am a firm believer that everything happens for a reason and you were my reason today, to stay alive, to feel something other than this hollowness of negativity. Thank you and Happy Birthday."
depression,esrfyek,t3_c8x5y2,1562224333.0,"This is exactly me. No matter how great I am feeling it's always there. Lingering. It's only a matter of time until I fulfill what I believe to be my will in life. I've felt this way since as young as I can remember. Each year that goes by with no production of children or marriage to a husband, is yet another reassurance to me that I truly have nothing or nobody, thus no reason to live. The only reason I am alive today is not only the fear, but my sisters. Once they don't need me anymore is when I shall find rest."
BorderlinePDisorder,esbhaom,t3_c6qupg,1561792120.0,It’s barely my first month. I was supposed to see my doctor this last week about how it’s working for me but I wasn’t taking them consistently.
BorderlinePDisorder,esbd5yy,t3_c6qupg,1561786715.0,"I feel ya, this shit is difficult. Ive been taking my anti depressants like I was told to not missing a day and I feel like I can deal with life but like how I feel is fake, not really me. I still can say I think about killing myself but in a more peaceful way instead of violent and sad.... I also have been doing really destructive behaviors I told myself I would quit. Did great for a week or two then came back and with a vengeance, almost like I needed to make up for lost time.... Still waiting on  therapy but I'm really dobting it's gonna happen in time. Losing hope here."
depression,esbct86,t3_c6s9yk,1561786301.0,the first and most scary step. good luck on your endeavor. YOU GOT THIS!
offmychest,esa4g17,t3_c6h910,1561751280.0,"My personal thoughts on this (and you do not have to agree) is that people call things ""an excuse"" is because they do not understand how difficult something is to the person experiencing something that they are going through. I do agree that in this world and our own lives have the right to create change to most things. I feel like as humans we try to control too many aspects of our environment that when we do not hold that power we ""fall victim"" to it. complaining about something we cannot control and ultimately allow it to bother us. If something is in your control, then by all means do what you can about it. No matter how many times you may fail, keep striving. But if something is in fact inevitable then forget about it. Don't allow it to consume you. Get rid of the negative because you ALWAYS have that ability to allow something or someone to effect you and how you will choose to either acknowledge it or just let it run its course."
depression,es8kfd3,t3_c6doym,1561701263.0,RELATE 1000%
BorderlinePDisorder,es8jxkz,t3_c6d8wj,1561700705.0,"I can relate to this 1000% I have been OBSESSIVELY craving it so bad that I had posted an ad to find someone. I then hit a moment where I realized it was crazy and dangerous (as I am a female that lives alone) so I stopped responding to the messages but still crave it. So instead of being able to fulfill that need and want I took up a less dangerous but erratic behavior. I've been out of control with my sex life and sleep with a lot of different people. One I got to role play a rape fantasy but lacked the violence because he said he wasn't comfortable hurting me.... I want to eventually stop but right now it makes me feel powerful and in some kind of ""control""."
BorderlinePDisorder,er05z46,t3_by6i10,1560411361.0,I wonder and hope the same. I say all the time “why can’t I just be normal” but THIS is my normal. As bad as it is. I do unhealthy things that make my emotions all out of whack and flare up. I hate that I do it but can’t stop. Not yet. I used to wonder about meeting someone but now I don’t. I’ve come to terms that I might be alone and am comfortable with the idea. Mostly cuz I feel the longer I’m alone the more real my purpose is to just end things. Instead of worrying about the future and what might or might not be I try to focus on all the things about myself that I have the power to change. Like my weight for one. Everything else I’ll deal with when I need to.
BorderlinePDisorder,er02bq5,t3_by6i10,1560409656.0,"I can relate to you and you are not alone, keep striving and forget what people say or think about you and just live one day at a time. Try to distract yourself even when you dont have the energy or motivation to. Everyday is a bad day for me but I get through it by listening to music almost every second of the day or watch TikToks. Sometimes I'll zone out just about life. I hate those moments cuz I feel empty. One thing I can suggest is giving yourself something to look forward to. I feel it'll always be at the back of our minds but thats where I try to make sure it stays."
BorderlinePDisorder,er00jk6,t3_bygaws,1560408874.0,"I actually feel very comfortable confiding in my lead. I deal with anxiety attacks and he'll often relieve me for a break and get myself together. I really appreciate him.

Oh and he'll check in on me on my days off and send little positive reminders of how beautiful life is and to take life one day at a time. :)"
depression,eqzx767,t3_bzwn3f,1560407392.0,Welcome to my life. I also hate it.
depression,eqytf5v,t3_bzufco,1560389124.0,"This sounds like my first appointment this last week. I mean I am REALLY trying hard to get myself together and under control so trying EVERYTHING, that includes therapy, something I AM NOT a fan of. 

&#x200B;

Met my psychologist for the first time and i told her I was having a difficult time with my BPD and first thing she does is interrupt me and ask who diagnosed me and when. I told her back in middle school when I first starting giving this a try and she proceeded to ""inform"" me that they cannot do that until I am at least the age of 18. I was like ""ok, whatever"" and continued to talk about how I'm feeling, doing and thinking. It was a quick little intro session but I needed to vent. 

&#x200B;

At the end she says ""okay, I can see you've had a lot of trauma in your life and can understand why someone told you about the BPD, in just the 15 mins you've talked to me I can see some of those symptoms"" I'm like okay so what should I be doing? she then flat out told me she doesn't know if she'd be much help because I needed more frequent therapy sessions, and she only sees patients once every three weeks. 

&#x200B;

She then asked what I wanted to do and said I was waiting for my referral to go through but don't know how much longer I can handle things and she asked again if I wanted to make another appointment with her or what? At this point, of course, I was reluctant to do so but agreed saying it'll give me something to look forward to. Then she threw it out there how if the other placed called I can always cancel with her. It's like thanks, a lot! ugh! So irritating and upsetting that this is actually her job, doesn't seem like she even cares. so what good is she?"
BorderlinePDisorder,eqxfs1u,t1_eqvyl1k,1560368709.0,I’ve started to make myself more of the priority now but always catch myself slipping or almost. I’ll be talking to someone and wanna offer something but now think twice before just spitting it out. I’ve also pushed a lot of people away and don’t make an effort to meet new people. Always the same shit. And I’ve made peace with that. Don’t know if I’m happy about it but I definitely feel stronger.

BorderlinePDisorder,eonqqxk,t3_bsdbgv,1558719215.0,I also don’t have one. I stopped trying to rely on people when I notice they can’t or don’t pull thru for me when I need them most.

I can't do that to her.

I wish I had stuck to the plan cuz I wasted all those years struggling and going to school just to try to get back to it but financially cant....
