aspergers,fr3ne5a,t1_fr1usm0,1589861329.0,"> It's often only certain types of touch or sensory triggers that set off people. Weighted blankets are very popular because autistic people seem to love the gentle pressure of being hugged. It's hard for me to say this is unusual or not without more clarification. 

In regards to that, I genuinely am not sensitive in regards to many things, for instance I do not feel that uncomfortable wearing clothing that is too tight, or too loose. As far as touch goes, I'm perfectly fine with being touched and such even from a stranger, as a matter of fact if anything I am, or rather was, a bit too touchy. 

I would like to ask, if you don't mind of course, what would cause you to believe that I have Autism. Its not that I take it as a bad thing, it is who I am at the end of the day, but I'm just curious. 

Anyhow, thank you for your insight! I appreciate it!"

mentalhealth,fq8v592,t1_fq49py3,1589176425.0,"Thank you for your advice, it is appreciated. You are right, but the thing is I’m scared because realistically speaking, this is possible only if I get my health under control. Currently I’m dealing with high heart rate, insomnia and brain fog. These issues have altered my mood quite a bit, and have caused me significant stress. As a result, for the last year I have lost my personality, became much depressed, and changed as a person in general. Consider this, I could be totally fine one minute, and in the next after eating a meal, I could be totally lightheaded, fatigued and gasping for air, and will be for the next two hours. I can’t even bodybuild anymore due to issues like these . 

While these are issues that could be solved with healthcare treatment and such, its the thought that I still don’t know whats going on and that the symptoms are so bad that scares me. These are issues that I’ve left to develop for well over a year or two now, and honestly I’m now sure if their effects could be, well, for lack of a better word, fixed. But then again, you’re right, I should visualize I future without these issues, or at least less of them."

Also, I’d recommend asking on r/askpsychiatry. Experienced psychiatrists will be able to help you out on there and I’m sure they will be of greater help than me."

With rest his mind will clear up and he’ll begin to be open to the idea of seeing a psychiatrist, especially if you begin to make him realize how delusional he was and how much he’s changed. Maybe make an audio recording of him while he’s going through one of his days and show it to him.

First off, you’ve got to evaluate your sleep and eating habits. Especially that you’re schizophrenic, sleep is of extreme importance. If you go through an insomnia episode, do whatever you can to get your sleep back because untreated it will cause you go through psychotic episodes which will suck, a lot. 
As far as eating habits go, try to minimize fatty foods, and eat as much high fiber foods as possible, and most importantly have as many omega 3 rich foods as omega 3 is extremely beneficial for your mental health. 

As far as therapy goes, I’m not sure what sort of therapy will be beneficial for you, but in general I’d recommend seeing a psychiatrist who is well experienced as schizophrenia is not easy to treat."

You don’t have terrorism like we do, and you certainly don’t face the same threats we do. You can afford to jail a terrorist or two because you don’t have the risk of prison breaks or prison escapes. We can’t. We have instability and coups which frequently give terrorists opportunities to escape from prisons. Also, in my country (Egypt), we have a huge Palestinian insurgency, where we fight people whose sole purpose in life is to terrorize Egyptians. They’ve killed hundreds of Egyptians and hundreds of tourists, and without reason. We have to threaten these people with death, we have to torture them, we have to be inhuman towards them and make them fear  terrorizing us, because otherwise, thousands will die in terrorist attacks. For the record, only 180 people have been executed in 5 years in Egypt. Nearly all are terrorists that were too dangerous to live. Lets say that this wasn’t the case and 20 of them were innocent. So, do we let some 160 terrorists live because 20 innocent people might get killed? Keep in mind, we’re not talking about run of the mill terrorist. We’re talking ex special forces, killed 30 soldiers and orchestrated horrible terrorist attacks sort of terrorists. Even if only one escaped due to a prison break, and did a terrorist attack at least 20 innocents will die, and that’s the best case scenarios. And that’s not even considering the amount of intelligence that is pulled from terrorists under threat of death, intelligence that saves hundreds of lives. So yeah.

worldnews,foobaal,t1_fom30v2,1587935955.0,"Well, it depends on the religion really. Some religions are flexible and some are not. I haven’t done too much research on this to be honest, all I know is that my religion, Islam, can be flexible. With proof being that in my country before both wahabbism and ignorance spread there was still good religious ideals, such as forbidding drugs and alcohol, forbidding of harassment of women (in Arab countries this is a big deal as arabs are pretty awful towards women, more on that later), and just being good to people in general. It was only when ignorance took over due to a 30 year rule by a dictator who did not care about education that religion and ignorance mixed, also wahabbist (extremist) bastards influenced the religion that religion was fucked essentially. Women were forced to cover up, FGM spread, sexual harassment became a thing (99.3% harassment rate in my country!), and we became number one in the world in teenage drug use. Keep in mind the same applies in other Muslim countries. Also, keep in mind that most religious organizations do a lot of good. I was actually in a religious club when I was 12 and even though they were ultra conservative we still did a lot of charity work. That applies to Muslim and non Muslim religious organizations too. 
Also, as for extremists, keep in mind not everything you see on the news is true. Extremists are not religious. They don’t even follow their own extremist version of Islam and that’s apparent because in Muslim countries they bomb mosques, and seldom if ever target any other religious institutions or places they’d deem would spread other religions and what they call “blasphemy”. Also, I know a major who’s fighting insurgents as we speak right now near Gaza, in Egypt, says most extremists they capture don’t even know the most basic scripture from the Quran.

worldnews,folj411,t1_folcmwg,1587863331.0,I don’t get your logic. You really think that the religion which forces its followers to donate 2.5% of their savings every year to charity would be capable of being dangerous? That’s illogical.
worldnews,folgpkl,t1_fola2cx,1587861854.0,"1) I understand you now. Still, its not religion that tells people to go around killing others. Even extremists would never be capable of murder unless they had some sort of mental condition which is why for instance at least 8% of Saudi Arabia follows wahabbism, the extremist form of Islam that Al Qaeda and the Taliban follow, but yet Christians and non Wahabbis are at worst occasionally looked down upon. Keep in mind, I have a mother from a sect of Islam that is discriminated against in Saudi, and I lived in Kuwait which is a country with a people that have very similar religious practices to the Saudis, so I have first hand experience with this. 
2) Keep in mind, theres dark and light ages in all civilizations which is normal. Unfortunately in dark ages in religious countries ignorance is reflected in religions, since after all the religion is 1400 years old and its original founders are not around anymore, it’s open to be interpreted in many ways. Ignorant people will obviously interpret it the way they wish to, unfortunately. Which is why the religion is not followed correctly, even by religious people, for instance hijabs are not worn correctly nowadays.
3) Because it unites societies, and brings people of all classes and races together. As a Muslim I’d pray with lower class people, or upper class people in mosques, whereas usually I don’t interact much with either. 
Other than that, it allows people to be charitable. I don’t know about Christianity but in Islam every Ramadan we must donate 2.5% of our savings. That’s a lot of charity considering there’s 1.6 billion Muslims out there.
4) Yeah I won’t deny mental health support is found from friends family and therapy, but religion just works for some people. For me personally I’ve had a history of severe anxiety, religion would be the one thing that would calm me down, because I remember that I have purpose in life and thats to achieve great things in this world for my creator. To make this world a better place to please my creator. And I’m thankful for that.
5) I actually really respect that. You’re very polite and I must thank you for that. As for religion it’s unfortunate that people just listen to priests and the equivalent instead of being open minded and asking questions. I believe if people started asking why, rather than what, we’d live in a much better world. Religion should not divide us. In my opinion, we don’t live to spread our religion for the sake of religion but instead to do what religion was intended to do, spread good deeds throughout the world, and make this world a better place. Thats worship for me, alongside prayer which calms the soul and therefore enhances our ability to achieve great things in life."

worldnews,fol64qx,t1_fokzlx7,1587855631.0,"1.	There’s no single religion that tells you to kill people as a matter of fact the total opposite is true. In Islam’s case, we’re not allowed to kill to spread our religion, or torture, or anything of the like. We instead are at most allowed to tax non Muslims, but that was of course on option not something that we were necessarily forced to do. In case of wars, you can’t touch a civlian or their property. We’re not even allowed to chop down trees that belong to the opposite warring party.
2.	⁠Yeah because its 2020. Back then it was 859, that was a major achievement. In today’s world we still celebrate women being in the workforce, while in the 9th century women were busy owning businesses and inventing new methods of education that would advance the world. Women were given respect in Islam, as a matter of fact the prophet used to work for his own wife, even todays world imagine someone like Obama working for his own wife! He would be celebrated by feminists. There’s loads of other examples of women being respected in Islam eg, Fadl Ibn Abbas, the prophet’s cousin and one of my great ancestors, saw a beautiful women in his village and just couldn’t take his eyes off of her, while he was with the prophet. So what’d the prophet do when he saw that? He didn’t tell her to cover up, rather he physically pushed his cousin’s face to force him to look away. 
3. Read what I said again. I never said it just permitted education, I’m saying it actively encouraged it in a time where people would not even do anything other than wage war for their tribes. 
And lastly, you wanna know what the fuck Islam means to me? Look at our discussion. You my friend are looking for an argument, and are using language that no adult should ever use in a discussion. Yet I choose to despite your clear ignorance try to educate you on my religion. What does that say to you about my religion, it’s taught me to respect even those who are clearly below me.

Britain and France would’ve been hypocritical to stop the militarization of the Rhineland as they never abided by treaties themselves, they would’ve been hypocritical to stop the Sudetenland annexation as they were annexing foreign land themselves, and they would’ve been hypocritical to stop Jewish pogroms since they themselves treated minorities horribly. But what was the end result of leaving a growing power that was already power hungry and racist do whatever unchecked? A world war, and the holocaust. We’re looking at the exact same scenario here, a growing authoritarian power with aspirations to annex foreign territories and ethnically cleanse its minorities. We can either leave them be, or be hypocrites and keep them in check before they start a world war."
worldnews,fokol1h,t1_fokmnm1,1587845977.0,"Thats a moral option and not a politically sound one and with how US politics works is totally impossible. Congress would never allow it, and no foreign country will gain anything from trying to force the US to pay reparations, however, forcing the Chinese to pay reparations would make them to realize we’ve had enough of their aggression and will not stand for it, which will happen either way with the way the Chinese have been acting recently, better now while we can do it peacefully rather than later when we’ll be forced to stop their aggression with more violent methods. Keep in mind, they already want Taiwan and are working on annexing it by 2040, by diplomatic or military means, which will either start a major war or start a chain of events that will lead to one. We have the opportunity to peacefully block Chinese aggression from growing now, and we should take it."

Between Uighur concentration camps, the South China Sea crisis, and now letting COVID destroy the world economy just to save face, they’re getting away with far too much. Shall we teach them that they can get away with whatever due to their economic and military might, we’ll regret it later on just like we have with the Nazis."
worldnews,fokiura,t1_foki4sq,1587842879.0,"200 years have passed. 
Thats like robbing a house today and justifying it because 200 years ago your great ancestors looted a native’s house. 
The Chinese need to face consequences for their actions. They are getting away with concentration camps and the South China Sea crisis and a lot more, if we give leave a message that they’re to step on the rest of the world now, we’re fucked later on."

I feel the exact same symptoms, however I’m 18 and male. 
I’m going to see a neurologist to evaluate my sleep soon and my brain health in general. I recommend you do the same. 
Also, I recommend that you get a HR monitor, as getting one indicated to me that I have circulatory  system issues that needed taking care of that contributed to my fatigue, or were possibly a symptom, I still don’t know for sure as I’m still working out a diagnosis with my cardiologist. 
Best of luck with what you’re going through :)"

mentalhealth,fo8scef,t1_fo8g6pj,1587602827.0,"Actually not bad at all haha. It’s very good stuff. And your vocals ain’t bad either. I’ll be sure to give you a follow or subscribe or whatever its called on soundcloud lol.
And as for your lyrics, they don’t have to be understood by everyone. Eminem’s best songs allude to events in his life in a way that is also cryptic, as a matter of fact to understand half his lyrics you’ll need genius or some other lyrical website, otherwise you just won’t be able to understand what he’s even talking about lol, but even if you don’t understand his songs, you’ll still enjoy them because they’re so well made as a result of him just rapping what’s on his mind and nothing else, he enjoys what he does and that gives his songs unmatched quality. So, enjoy what you do and your songs will come out sounding pretty well regardless of whether people will be able to understand them or not. Oh and I nearly forgot, do change your name. 
Best of luck with your rap!"

I myself actually believed at one point that my age made me immune to health issues, and here I am today, wishing I took action earlier before my health issues grew. 

I will send you a message now."
AskDocs,fo8gmqn,t1_fo7fm3a,1587596176.0,"I see. I mean anxiety could be a factor however I see it as a factor amongst many others, however its effects, for me at least, are minuscule since I have my anxiety mostly under control. As for family factors yeah I should’ve mentioned them. Anyhow, thanks for your input."
mentalhealth,fo8cgc9,t1_fo7x17z,1587593919.0,"I see. Thats great as well. You know I actually used to write comedic rap around a year or two ago, and I wanted to get into the songwriting business but unfortunately circumstances happened and I was forced to leave my plans for songwriting behind. Anyhow, from experience I can tell you that depression and emotional issues will give you a lot of emotional fuel for songwriting, even for comedic songs, so keep going. Speaking of, can you give me links to some of your songs? I’d love to hear them."
AskDocs,fo7evs5,t1_fo53wsx,1587577155.0,"Its not. Anxiety would cause high heart rate and BP during anxiety attacks but not during resting periods. As for people my age getting circulatory issues, keep in mind, genetics play a big role in circulatory issues, even more so than diet and fitness, and unfortunately I happened to be the grandson of one of the first people to do open heart surgery in my country so yeah hard luck ahaha."

I personally have anxiety, and another disorder which I don’t feel comfortable talking about, that being said I should be able to relate to you and give you advice. Do feel free to let it out, I did have severe anxiety before so I understand what you’re going through right now, and will be willing to listen."

mentalhealth,fo3o2kw,t1_fo3ny47,1587490128.0,Problems of the psychological or medical sort?
mentalhealth,fo3esrn,t3_g5h3xe,1587485677.0,"Well, you are seeking help which is always a good first step. I myself held in my emotions for months until it started becoming too much to handle. I too had issues expressing myself to others.
However when I started to express myself to myself by writing poetry, I found myself improving my ability to express myself to others, as I finally began to understand myself, and while sharing the poetry with others they began to understand me too. Try it. 
Also, try therapy. It will help you a lot."
mentalhealth,fo3cf6x,t3_g5bm8l,1587484498.0,"Neither can I. From experience though there’s one thing that can help and that’s self expression. Poetry, art, or just speaking your mind in general. Over time self expression will rewire your brain in order to accept coping mechanisms that are expressive. You will become more expressive and learn to cry and just express your emotions in general once again, which is very healthy for you."

I have not tried their services, neither do I know anyone who has, but they are well known in Egypt so they should be at least worth a try.

HealthAnxiety,fo19x8e,t1_fo0jr4h,1587428761.0,"Unfortunately, thats not the case. A somewhat ok ECG means that there’s no serious heart issue but it does not rule out vascular issues and minor heart problems. Especially when there’s still symptoms such as poor circulation (my wounds don’t even bleed), frequent lightheadedness, and shortness of breath which happen regardless of my mental state. Keep in mind, all I’ve done is an ECG, and occasional checks on blood pressure. Anyhow, I’ll leave the diagnosis up to professionals."
HealthAnxiety,fnyv58f,t1_fnwh001,1587376845.0,"Well, the idea is that long term, not now, I am screwed. Keep in mind, I train 6 days a week, have a body fat of 11%, and eat oatmeal twice a day and in general take good care of my body. It’s worrying because despite all that I’m having difficulties, so God knows what will happen when I get older. 
As for the diagnosis, I was working on getting one, but due to COVID I had to postpone that. I still don’t know whats going on, all I know is that its most likely an artery issue because the ECG I did was mostly fine. Hopefully I’ll figure out whats wrong and get it fixed."
HealthAnxiety,fnwcs7y,t3_g4907i,1587315906.0,"If its getting bad enough that you can’t exercise anymore then its too severe for you to handle it yourself. Don’t listen to anyone else who tells you this is purely anxiety because its not. This is (probably preexisting) anxiety made more severe by health issues. 
Here’s what you should do
List your symptoms on a paper. 
Note other health issues: Eg Insomnia, headaches, etc. etc.
Simulate a doctor’s appointment with someone you trust, better yet if they’re actual health workers, to make you less nervous about seeing one.
And see a cardiologist. 
I avoided doing this for a while and just stuck with improving my diet which was already damn perfect, and my training regimen which was also very good. Now I’m, pardon my language, totally screwed. As in 18 year old with a resting heart rate of 95, stage two hypertension, daily chest pain and forced to see cardiologist sort of screwed."
