kpoprants,fqyy42g,t3_gljyd5,1589756558.0,"Honestly I should do this too and good for you for doing it!! 

I see got7‚Äôs fandom most of the time on the timeline and it‚Äôs just become ‚Äújyp is not letting got7‚Äôs colours show. here are all of got7‚Äôs members rejected songs. here is one member saying he liked the first version of the song before jyp changed it. here‚Äôs a hate tweet on jyp. eclipse sucks. no actually, people who hate eclipse have no taste...‚Äù 

There were also fights about streaming when got7 were promoting nbtm. 

But then again, maybe I‚Äôm just seeing the bad stuff. I do understand that got7 should be able to make music that they want to make and fans tweeting this could make their company listen, but just seeing the same thing all the time and same hate tweets for jyp and same longing for what could have been is just too much for me"

BUTT markbam have great raps and jackson sings which is great because I don‚Äôt think his rap would‚Äôve fit in well. I think it‚Äôs a good cb after ymcn but also I feel like got7‚Äôs songs usually have a weak chorus except for ycmn off the top of my head. Anyways the album is actually cohesive!!

kpopthoughts,fnb3wgh,t3_g0gb7a,1586808770.0,"2012- Gangnam style was super popular when i was in eighth grade but i honestly still didn‚Äôt know what kpop was even after hearing it lol

2016- Friends introduce me to bts blood sweat and tears: now i know what kpop is. Then I found Got7 through hard carry and ended the year stanning bts & got7. I started one youtube channel (compilation/cracks) featuring vids for both of these groups.

2017- Interest for bts began to fade after dna (didnt like the LY trilogy). got7 became my top ults and still are as of 2020. Slightly poked into other kpop groups but only for music. Listened to exo the war and that was great but didn‚Äôt end up stanning (I was close to though cause that album was so good). My youtube channel became got7 focused as i lost interest for bts. I think i started reading fanfics this year lol

2018- Exo tempo made me stan. Around this time is where i branched out and listened to albums from different groups or soloists such as red velvet

2019- Further branching out particularly into rv, sf9 (rpm album is so good), loona, ateez along with others. Stanned ateez during wonderland era, became a music stan of loona during butterfly and sf9 during rpm. Listened to victon‚Äôs nostalgic night and it is still my fave kpop song!I think it was this year where I attended my first concert: rv‚Äôs red mare

2020- stanned golden child during wannabe & stanned victon during howling. Probably in the process of stanning the boyz, sf9, and oneus in future comebacks.   I‚Äôm also interested what apink, ab6ix, trei (where are theyyyy), dreamcatcher, kard, cix, and 1team will do next. Love for got7 remains strong albeit I will admit my attention for them is less than in previous years and i stopped uploading to my youtube channel mostly bc of time conflicts/lack of motivation.

Overall, I started with two groups and then branched out and listened to many groups :) dabbled in fan created content and... thats it! That was a fun journey"

This is my personal taste but i would replace the got7 on the arms to lyrics like [this](https://idolsfashion.com/products/got7-eyes-on-you-2018-tour-t-shirt)  (it‚Äôs for their eyes on you tour, although it‚Äôd kinda be plagiarism lool!) But i really like the simplicity of it and how it is sort of vague as in who wrote these lyrics and what do they mean? Lol. maybe ask her what her favourite lyric is and then have that lyric in scripture across the arm :) i also think you could reduce the back logo or take it out entirely. but yeah everything looks great :)"

unpopularkpopopinions,fk9e29t,t3_fh63z2,1583974174.0,"It wasn‚Äôt my favourite either! I personally prefer You Are or Look. I‚Äôve been an ahgase for a few years now but I just didn‚Äôt get the hype over it? They look good in suits but idk they‚Äôre just suits lol nothing too creative. It‚Äôs nice to listen to first listen but I think the replayability goes down a lot for me. I think the whole album was like that actually- within a few listens, i‚Äôd be bored (EXCEPT run away)! I probably killed ycmn (and the album) within a 5ish listens? I feel like the chorus is too repetitive butttt the visuals and choreo were nice. Hope this doesn‚Äôt come across as hateful as they‚Äôre my ults but i gotta be real.

Oh and i actually didn‚Äôt hate mark‚Äôs part in ycmn lool but yeah it was kinda weird.

Also can i tack on another opinion? I don‚Äôt like Page, Crash & Burn, and Can‚Äôt see/come on and they wouldn‚Äôt have been good title tracks despite ahgases usually saying they should‚Äôve been (again, i think they‚Äôre repetitive choruses that don‚Äôt change up throughout the three times theyre in the song)"

kpopthoughts,fjze3zl,t3_feezg6,1583717584.0,"I‚Äôm late but this is a solid album! First listen I wasn‚Äôt that into it but I‚Äôm doing a second listen literally right now and it‚Äôs pretty nice. I think the only skips for me is Mad Dog lol I just can‚Äôt listen to it  a second time and skipped it. I also don‚Äôt like what they did with Boom‚Äôs chorus ahghhh!! But current faves are Kick it and Pandora‚Äôs box and the interlude (they never disappoint with these man). Other than that, really good album! Love the concept"

simonfraser,fjwpw9z,t3_ff6iim,1583642796.0,"Hey I‚Äôm 3rd year doing a bio major rn so I believe that all the general core courses I took back then is basically the same as what you‚Äôll be taking this year. 

I took four courses my first term (bisc 102, chem 121, phys 100 (physics 12), and math 154) and it was awful lol! I didn‚Äôt know how to study for the courses and everything was just new so it was hard to adjust. I think you should take 3 courses first semester if you want and then see if you wanna do 4 after that. You don‚Äôt really need to follow the recommended course schedule unless you really want to graduate in 4 yrs(?). 

I suggest taking one lab course first term so either bisc 101/102 or chem 121. I thought chem 121 was the hardest and taking two labs in the same term as a first year was kinda bad lol.. 

If you want to do 4 courses, maybe take an elective, like what the other comment says. And yeah my gpa suffered first term lol i was at 2.54 (a B-?) and im almost 4th year looking at a 3.2 (still not that good but better) after consistent term gpas of 3.4-3.6 after that 2.54 ... so i have regrets lol! 

Sfu is a three semester school so you could just do some courses in the summer as well (some classes might not be offered though but i think first year classes should be there)?

Ipad with pen should be fine. If you can type on it too then thats good too. Profs will usually upload slides before class so you can just write on the downloaded slides during class to take notes. My phys 100 prof watkins did hand written notes so youll be fine for that too.

I dont really remember any outstanding profs in first year tbh lol but i like erin barley! Had her for my bisc 360 class and shes great and she also teaches bisc 102. You can also search up your profs in ratemyprof and it should help you for deciding what courses you want to take.

Oh yeah and i dont really remember a lot of diagrams in first term but there was memorizing for bisc and chem i think. and for math, chem & physics you gotta practice a lot; dont just read over the slides & examples, actually do them & supplemental questions

Sorry this is long af but hope it helps lol"

unpopularkpopopinions,fj7cobt,t3_fbs7uu,1583089707.0,"Oh yeah definitely. It used to happen in got7‚Äôs fandom too where two ahgases commented on jackson‚Äôs instagram account asking ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs short?‚Äù and the other replied ‚Äúidk but jackson is.‚Äù Jackson‚Äôs the shortest member and he pokes fun at himself sometimes for that reason. I don‚Äôt really recall other members calling him short but it might‚Äôve happened and I‚Äôm not remembering correctly? Anyways, guess what, jackson saw it and called them out for their staged ‚Äújoke‚Äù saying that it wasn‚Äôt funny. I just think people should stop teasing others for something they cant change like their height. Yeah the jokes are all in good fun but we aren‚Äôt the idols‚Äô friends and don‚Äôt really have the intimacy to joke around with them about stuff like that"

I buy second hand albums without the PCs and I don‚Äôt have a cd player so I basically have the albums as decoration. I do honestly think albums are useless but I just like to have them and use them to make my room a bit more personalized so I guess it has use for me in a way. I don‚Äôt like buying digital albums either because you can find the full album downloads on third party sites or on free streaming services like spotify or youtube and agreed, if it‚Äôs not a physical album then what‚Äôs the point.
