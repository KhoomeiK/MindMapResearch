AmItheAsshole,fokzprs,t3_g7swpo,1587852039.0,"NTA For the same reasons many people have already discussed, but it also may be helpful to bring up to him that staying with you all may not be in the best interest of his sister either. It sounds like she needs assistance with ALDs as well as IADLs. Unless your husband or you have caring giving or direct support service experience, this could potentially lead to more serious health issues. She also likely won't be getting much socialization outside of the family if she lives with you all. Even if you guys are able to find a day program, you all with end up having to do a good bit of coordinating and researching to make that happen if you are her sole care givers. She also sounds like she has some behaviors regarding getting her way and attention seeking. This is going to be challenging in an environment with small children who needs constant attention. She would do much better in a stable environment with people who can learn how to best communicate with her and have experience working with people with disabilities."
AmItheAsshole,fodvl2o,t3_g6ps43,1587690953.0,NTA and honestly Jill and those on her side are looking at this the wrong way. Jill introduced Henry to his family AND adopted another child. If she really needs to feel important then she should brag about that not treat Henry as if he is an object that she clearly mesh well in the first place. I really hope her own adopted child helped her grow up.

I've been on several different medications, usually at least two at a time. Lithium is the first one I've been able to take without any other medication. It's also very affordable which is awesome.
