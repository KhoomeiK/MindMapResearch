Barotrauma,fq8fugh,t3_gfsnk8,1589165250.0,"I‚Äôve been using it this with my crew for a bit. It seems after awhile the text on the helm gets pushed together which makes it harder to read it usually happens after the first round or when it gets damaged. 

The red spot lights are much too dim to really see much. 

the top docking port has no airlock and for some reason opens when there is a creature/human swimming by. 

Also I don‚Äôt make subs so I have no idea how it would work, maybe the ship batteries could automatically turn on once power is lost to the helm. because as soon as you use too much power while piloting everything switches off and the ship begins wildly thrusting very fast in the last selected direction. Otherwise very.

Great work on this sub and I‚Äôll be sure to follow along with new ones in the future."

The zombie could either come up the stairs and we would just go down the slide, he could come up the slide or he could wait and we would forcibly sacrifice someone down the slide. 

We wouldn‚Äôt play it like tag where you touch someone. You would have to fake bite someone. Also people who got infected were only blobs and  couldn‚Äôt bite anyone. They would just hold someone down and wait for the zombie to bite them.

Another game we play was ‚ÄúJam the slide‚Äù it‚Äôs when we got a bunch of people to all go down the slide. I usually went first, I would prop my feet against the slide very firmly and wait for people to come down. Many people were almost hurt and I was kicked and punched in the head because I was blocking the slide for so long and people were in lots of pain. 

TL:DR zombie tag was lit and they had to close the slide because of us."
