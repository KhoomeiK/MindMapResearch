Roth IRA. 22 years old. Just started it. I'm pretty certain theses are the ones I'm gonna roll with. But I'm just unsure about the allocation. VTI and VXUS for growth while VYM and SPHD for the dividends. I'm really into dividends.  

I know this is a classic Vanguard-ish portfolio, just without BND. Since I'm so young I'd rather replace bonds with dividend paying funds like VYM and SPHD.  What do you guys think?  

Thanks!"

But either way I think Israel would try to gas him out by making him miss and attacking the body - something Whittaker did well with the first fight with the front body kicks. Israel can also use a roundhouse to the body from orthodox to cause some damage since Joel is southpaw, for the most part. But he can catch Izzy with some bombs if he falls for the false sense of security.  And obviously the takedown threat is already there and I‚Äôm curious to see if Izzy can stuff the initial shots which I think he can."
