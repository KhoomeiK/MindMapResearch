TheDollop,fnhuoge,t1_fngqtpu,1586969148.0,I totally agree.  I'm halfway through right now.  I love Gareth in most every episode but this one he was particularly on point.
ptsd,flhif1y,t3_fok9ew,1585163253.0,"Yes, I was just talking to my therapist about this recently.  It has slightly exacerbated my issues, specifically OCD with handwashing and using hand sanitizer.  But overall, my life has not changed much.  I am more cautious if I have to go out get some essentials like groceries or prescriptions, but honestly my regular routine schedule has not changed much at all.  And while I do empathize with a lot of people, there is also some resentment, like ""see what you are feeling now is what I go through every day!!""  But I have a variety of other symptoms besides just fear, anxiety and panic.  

&#x200B;

I do get people's fear and panic for sure and I wouldn't say that to anybody.  But yes, this hasn't changed much for me at all.  Almost just kind of numb from it.  The big difference is even though I didn't go out much before, it was a bigger option then so I can kind of feel ""trapped"" in my apartment now.  

&#x200B;

In a way now, my OCD fears are actually kind of real now as opposed to something that was very irrational before.  

&#x200B;

However, I do understand the fears of losing jobs or not having the resources to make it through this.  Many people are struggling and I can empathize with that as one of my friends was laid off.  So I get it, but I'm also kind of numb to this whole situation in certain moments too.  **It's complicated for sure.** Has been nice to work from home more often though, I will say that."
ptsd,fkba733,t3_fhgky1,1584029168.0,"I've seen varying percentages.  I don't believe 100% for most anything.  Especially something like this in which everyone has a unique story.  

From what I've read online and read in ""The Body Keeps The Score"", the EMDR is much more effective for those with one time traumas as opposed to repeated traumas.  Also, might have less of an effect if the trauma took place when the person was younger and again the severity.  I don't say that to undermine anyone, but just is what I've heard.  

I'm sure it has worked for some people with childhood trauma and repeated traumas and maybe hasn't worked for those with a one time trauma.  

But I would say it is quite misleading that your therapist told you it is 100% effective.  That doesn't seem very professional to me.  And I definitely think it is worth a shot to try it but if it doesn't work, then it doesn't work.  That is not your fault."
ptsd,fi5q5q3,t1_fi5fsl3,1582168314.0,"Got it, that would be incredibly tough and hard to trust again when that is exploited.  I'm glad you are comfortable with that vulnerability!  It's a place I want to get to, because vulnerability is incredibly important. But I understand what you mean feeling like an outsider.  

And I too hope you find that work environment someday!  And I think you will, just might take some time and patience unfortunately."
ptsd,fi5dqjo,t1_fi51s1p,1582160805.0,"So I've been at the company I work at for like 5 years.  When I started there I had just started therapy and didn't have my PTSD symptoms in full swing.  I had anxiety and stuff but not nearly as bad as it is now.  Fortunately for me, I got a doctor's note from my therapist within the last year to allow me to work from home occasionally.  So usually twice a week I can work from home.  Also fortunately my managers have been very understanding about it.  

However at previous jobs I have worked at, it wasn't as good of culture and this situation definitely wouldn't have worked out there.  

So yeah I work full time just some days it is incredibly hard to go to work.  Sometimes I have mood swings but I don't usually have breakdowns or anything, I'm able to somehow manage through work.  Most likely because I am familiar with most of the people and the environment.  

And I totally know what you mean.  There is a huge stigma around not only mental health but also men crying.  We're not supposed to show emotions, glad that is at least starting to change in our society. But I actually have the opposite problem, I have a really hard time trying to cry because of how I was raised.  That is changing a bit but I still have my ""wall"" up. 

And with how bad your symptoms are right now, it sounds like it would be incredibly tough to not only work but just manage day to day. 

I'm not sure what experience you have but you could check out lionbridge.  They offer some part time work from home positions.  And if you Google a bit you might be able to find some work from home jobs like data entry or something similar.  Not sure if that helps at all but there are some options out there depending on experience and such."
ptsd,fi4yae0,t1_fi4wq4s,1582150908.0,"No worries!  I hope others can respond in support as well.  I get the broken trust part, that's pretty fucked up.  

And while I didn't go through the same experience as you, I can relate to some of your feelings, especially the disconnection and isolation. It's shitty! I am able to go to work somedays but it's really hard for me to leave the house, especially when I don't have to.  But, as with everything it's been up and down with good days and bad days.  

I really do hope the new therapy goes well and that you can get the full support you need through that.  But I think it's good that you posted on here as this seems to be a small but good community to find that support as well."
ptsd,fi4ufm2,t1_fi4qdn8,1582148667.0,"Got it - I kind of just assumed this was your first time.  So my mistake on that part.  

&#x200B;

Totally get where you are coming from.  And I'm obviously not a professional, but from what I have heard of EMDR, it is great for one time traumas.  As you would expect, everyone reacts differently, so it may not work for you but it's definitely worth trying (as you sound aware of).    


Just so I'm not reading the situation wrong and giving advice when it is not needed, were you looking for something specific in the responses or were you wanting to share your story and that you are starting therapy again?  It's fine either way, just want to make sure I'm not jumping into assumptions!    


And very sorry to hear about the situation you went through.  That is really shitty and even though I haven't been through that specifically it's sounds very difficult.  It sucks that you have to go through this."
ptsd,fi4o9qv,t3_f6gks8,1582145178.0,"I would like to say that is a huge first step!  What you went through sounds incredibly scary and I'm glad you are getting help.  If I have any advice, it would be to try to be patient as going through therapy is a very slow process.  Having empathy for yourself is very important but also very hard to do.  And I would also say, not every therapist will be compatible.  So if you happen to get some therapists you don't mesh with, don't give up and try to seek out others.  

&#x200B;

I have been in therapy for about 5 1/2 years now.  Originally I just thought it was anxiety/depression but after about 2 years in therapy some repressed memories came back and I realized I had PTSD from sexual abuse in my childhood.  The therapy is difficult and even though it is hard to see, I have made a lot of progress.  I'm at kind of a low right now, but this can happen and my mood will go up and down.    

&#x200B;

If you have any questions, want to chat, or even just want some resources such as books that have helped me, feel free to message or comment.  

&#x200B;

But that is a great first step, so good job!  It is very scary to take that first step!"
ptsd,fi0kzfn,t3_f5r4eg,1582039369.0,"Childhood trauma can absolutely lead to intimacy and relationship issues.  It's something I am still dealing with (my past trauma didn't surface until about two to three years ago while in therapy).  I'm still in therapy and in a very tough spot but I know it is best for me in the long run as I have noticed improvements in mindfulness and connecting to myself.

Since this happened as a child, the gist of it is that the trauma rewires your brain.  From what you wrote, you didn't have a healthy relationship at all and need to work with your therapist (slowly and gradually) to help improve that.  It's unfortunately a super slow process and your therapist would have a lot more professional advice.

I guess my point is that childhood trauma can and does absolutely cause these issues and you are not alone with these feelings (even though it probably feels isolating, I feel alone all the time).  Hopefully your partner is understanding and if you find out you are attracted only to the same sex, there is nothing wrong with that.

I hope that helps, but let me know if you have any other questions or need any resources (such as some books that helped me).

EDIT: And yes, this has totally impacted my relationships and intimacy with others as well.  So much so that I isolate myself a lot from others, though I am working on that."
ptsd,fhxftm3,t3_f58rhk,1581953375.0,"On top of what others have said, nothing wrong with bringing stuffed animals!  If you by chance are worried about others seeing, you could put the stuffed animal in a back pack.  And I obviously don't know your therapist, but I would assume any good (and most) therapists would be totally understanding.  

&#x200B;

It could be even something you bring up to your therapist.  But I'm on board with the other posters, do it if it makes you feel safe!"
ptsd,fhxfbyj,t3_f58r5k,1581953048.0,"Like the person who posted before me, I don't necessarily have much advice besides saying it is something you would have to work through in therapy and once you start to resolve some of the trauma you would likely and gradually feel more safe in intimate or sexual situations (not a therapist, but that is my understanding).  

&#x200B;

I can relate though, Before I found out about my trauma, I always had a very difficult time in situations like that and I thought something was just wrong with me and then a couple years ago I found out about my past history of trauma that I had repressed and it all made sense.  I'm still having an insanely difficult time with any relationships really, even just friendship.  But I haven't been able to explore sex or even long term relationships (for the most part) and I'm in my late 20s.  

&#x200B;

I'm kind of ranting now, but just wanted to say you're not alone.  And it may be a slow and gradual change but as you start to resolve the trauma, I think you will feel safer in those situations."
ptsd,fbu4e3v,t3_eegwf6,1577107460.0,"If possible I would try to work with a psychiatrist.  I don't really have anything useful that helps me at night.  But I do typically have nightmares most every night.  Maybe not to the same intensity but they are there.  

I believe a medication called Prazosin deals directly with nightmares but it unfortunately didn't work for me.  Might be one to ask about though."
ptsd,fakw6g1,t1_fakq34f,1576174149.0,"I know I'm not the OP but I guess it depends on your level of comfortability.  It was extremely difficult to tell my best friend in person and I was incredibly exhausted afterwards but if you can handle it, face to face is better (at least for me) because I often misinterpret texts or certain reactions can get lost in text that don't in person.  

That being said, I still do share a lot of my struggles or mental health related issues over text with that same person.  So it depends on what you can handle and how comfortable you are."
ptsd,fakvigv,t1_fakpunj,1576173827.0,"I was hinting at it, but it's also good to know.  At the very least you telling them will hopefully help them understand what you are going through and hopefully lessen your triggers!"
ptsd,fajye6o,t3_e9m7oz,1576157313.0,"I think it helps to write down what you want to say.  And also why you are telling them.  Like maybe you want to provide understanding or will need support.

Hopefully they will be empathetic and understanding.  I wish you the best!

ptsd,faeh4di,t1_faegcue,1576000727.0,"And just to clarify, as a child I went through the sexual abuse (rape, molesting) by an adult male.  

I don't share all of the symptoms as you but I most certainly believe the symptoms you are going through are caused from the trauma you went through."
ptsd,faegcue,t3_e8oode,1576000329.0,"Yes, I most definitely get physical symptoms from my PTSD.  One book that helped me understand it more was The Body Keeps The Score by Bessel van der Kolk.  

Here are some symptoms I get.  
-nightmares nightly, so no quality sleep

-exhaustion and tiredness constantly

-Stomach flare ups (pain and diarrhea) pretty randomly but linked to the trauma, a few times a week

-OCD

-Hypervigilant and always on alert which also exhausts me

-this one is pretty rare but an occasional choking sensation linked to the trauma

-panic attacks if I put myself in certain social situations

-Anxiety/Depression

Interestingly enough, I discovered my PTSD about the same time frame as you.  Been in therapy for five years and found out about the childhood trauma about two and a half years ago.   

I'm going to go back and re-read your post.  I may reply to this comment with more but wanted to let you know that you are not alone."
ptsd,f9z3jb8,t3_e7ci7d,1575737618.0,"I definitely have sleep issues.  I'm not in the same cycle as you.  But I don't think I get quality sleep, almost always exhausted and tired no matter how much sleep I get.  And I know I have nightmares every night.  I haven't monitored but I don't think I'm getting quality REM sleep.  

Though, like I said I'm not going through that cycle like you are.  And while sometimes it can be hard to get to sleep, most the time I'm just not getting quality sleep.

I've tried some different medication for it but it unfortunately didn't help.  Still experimenting with that though with the help of my psychiatrist."
ptsd,f9z2arh,t1_f9w3tsw,1575737126.0,Very well said.  Particularly if they care they will try to understand and if you don't tell them there will be disconnect.  Both of these are very true.
ptsd,f9z1vdv,t1_f9z19mf,1575736967.0,"And like others have said, there have been different reactions from family.  All are supportive but I do feel distant with my family now.  Not necessarily their fault either but I've grown distant from them, at least for the moment as I'm trying to figure this all out.  But it's on both parties as well."
ptsd,f9z19mf,t3_e78lc7,1575736740.0,"I have told my best friend and a couple family members.  I haven't gone into details but I said I was sexually abused and by who when I was really young 

When I shared it with my best friend, I had written up what I was going to say to him.  And even why I was reading this to him.  Like I wanted to share it with him to provide understanding as to why I don't always go out or to why it is so difficult.  And also, to hopefully to grow our relationship as friends.  And read that to him and fortunately he was supportive.  He might not understand exactly what I went through or even what I go through everyday but he tries his best to be understanding and there if I need him.  

Though I haven't told other friends because I don't feel as close to them and I think they would be supportive but I'm just not comfortable with that yet.  

One thing I would say is you can't control their reaction like you said.  If you want to tell them, let them know you have something important to tell them.  You shouldn't be ashamed, obviously easier said than done because I still feel ashamed.  But I would maybe prepare what you are going to say to them and the details or lack thereof that you want them to know.

I wish you the best of luck and I hope is you share that their reactions are what you want/need."
