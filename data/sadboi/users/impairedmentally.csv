A doomer is someone who believes that global problemsâ€”including but not limited to ecological exhaustion, such as overpopulation, peak oil, climate change, and pollutionâ€”will cause the collapse of civilization, significant human population die-off, and potentially lead to eventual human extinction."
AskReddit,fnmtl7g,t1_fnmbsoo,1587077909.0,No you're not useless garbage. The only thing that matters is that you do your best and try to do the right thing no matter what the concequenses. Life has no objective meaning which means there is no inherent goal to achieve. As long as you're satisfied with the life you've lived then it has been a life worth living. Dont ever let anyone tell you you're useless because you dont fit into their perception of what a worthwhile life is. You're not garbage you're awesome.
