Anxiety,fl8drae,t1_fl8crmb,1584921373.0,"I was on medication for about 6 months when I was first diagnosed when I was 16. I stopped taking it thinking I‚Äôd be fine without it. It slowly got better but unfortunately it never goes away, but you learn how you as a person handles it. I also took counselling for it when I was 16 too, which helped to a certain extent. 

It‚Äôs been bad for me because I have anxiety/panic attacks over death and sickness, so this has been a whirlwind of emotion. 

A trick I do (and it sounds dumb but I‚Äôve had it for so long I just got sick of it) is I get up and TRY to do something around the house (dishes, taking a bath) and talk out loud (to the wall or myself I guess lol) and tell myself it‚Äôs just an anxiety, I am not dying, I will get through this. Sometimes I‚Äôll literally cuss my own brain and call it dumb for being so childish! Haha. 

If you feel that you need to seek professional help, do it. Do whatever YOU feel necessary to help yourself. If it means counselling or medication, or any other ways, don‚Äôt hesitate. Anxiety can take over your whole life, it is a lot more awful than people portray it as. So getting it under control is the best thing. I find talking about it helps me a lot as well. It‚Äôs reassuring that you‚Äôre not in this alone!

I wish you all the best and if you ever need a chat, I‚Äôm good for that!"
