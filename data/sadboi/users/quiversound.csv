ShouldIbuythisgame,fqvyj1b,t1_fqv975v,1589688132.0,"So I’m totally on your side and like a game to be about that length. Just comparing BL3 to Control, you can play BL games for a single play through at at least 50 hours and a lot of fans go on to play multiple times. I was only mentioning length because every one has extra free time right about now but not extra money. If money is tight, you should consider how much you’ll get out of it, even if it’s not as top tier as control seems to me."

I used to not even download games if I thought I would never play it, but one time I got the urge to play a game I had remembered was on ps+ but because I wasn’t interested *then* I didn’t have it when I was interested *now*. It is a gamble buying any games nowadays though since I do buy all the best games on offer at least at deep discount before they’re considered for plus.

DaysGone,fqghm8a,t3_gin1b2,1589346494.0,"There’s two dedicated skills for the crossbow, and after the upgrades, the drifter crossbow is a one hit kill even in the leg on normal mode. With its built in stealth, and it’s ability to hold extra ammo in the form of saplings and scrap, the crossbow alone can take out ambush camps relatively safely with pure stealth. Also the explosive bolts give you the most return on gun powder, one of the rarer resources, by giving you three explosives rather than a single pipe bomb or attractor bomb. It’s not the strongest explosive, but it does add a pretty moderately useful addition against smaller swarms or mobs, or for destroying certain sniper huts wrapped in orange rope, and the explosion happens instantly with  more precise aim rather than after several seconds. Turning a breaker against a swarm is fun with the residue bolt and breakers or bears can also be weakened with the incendiary bolt. Later on with the crow nests, the incendiary bolt uses fewer resources with better, faster aim to destroy the nests than with molotovs. All in all, it’s a highly effective weapon and I used it for most of my play through except when I wanted to shake up the gameplay. The poison arrow is pretty useless though. I can see it being somewhat useful against higher health enemies, but the difference was negligible compared to an automatic weapon."

I’m trying to stay positive and work my way into the economy. I went out and hunted a legendary animal for the first time and was like... cool! Then I was attacked by a bear. Not cool. Killed it anyway, REALLY COOL. It’s a poor pelt, but ah well, let’s take it to camp and see what the reward is. I found out at camp that I was only able to begin a specific mission and I can’t access any activities in the camp. So I couldn’t do anything with the poor bear pelt, and just left it there. Ugh, annoying. Then I did another main mission and opened up camp activities again. That bear pelt is gone now. First thing I do is open up a hunting mission. It’s for bison, so I get another large pelt. I run around to do a couple things with the fence and arrive at night with the pelt, and what do you know, the butcher is engaged with another character and... I’m awkwardly lying the pelt down... and am automatically sucked into a main mission where I am walking away from this pelt. I’m about to just give up on hunting at all if the game is going to interrupt me turning them in this frequently. I’m also still walking around with this legendary goat pelt on my horse butt. 

Do I just live with the game deleting my pelts, even if they’re poor pelts? How can I prevent these things from getting destroyed by plot imperative over player agency? Like who should I really be going to? Is camp  not the right place to bring them?"

DaysGone,fpn1vaf,t1_fpluytt,1588747705.0,"Out of your games in this list, bloodborne has been my favorite. Traditionally I play a game once only. However, I end up playing it once every year or so, but if you’re new to PS4, the game has a difficulty curve which can be frustrating until you get good. If you dig deep, the lore is really fascinating, world design is super creative and cool. I wouldn’t say the game is focused at all on story telling but you can infer a lot by putting two and two together from item descriptions and the settings. First play through is like 60-80 hours depending on your aptitude for learning, and the subsequent play throughs are 30-50 hours because of what you learn. DLC is a must play as the weapons it gives you are really fun, and it’s not a lazy, subpar piece of the game like some DLCs are.

I’d say you started off well with Days Gone, but it is a 40-50 hour game for completing most of the content. It really hooked me in and has been one of my favorite games in a while. Blasted through it in a week on quarantine. 

God of War is my second favorite from your list, even though I was never interested much in the original game trilogy. It has a deep, beautiful world, rich story and the combat is extremely engaging like bloodborne. It will be a comparable length to Days Gone, potentially longer by ten or fifteen hours.

If you do get into the Witcher, unless it’s better than gravy for you, don’t force yourself to finish it all in one sitting as it’s one of the longest game’s available. I have played somewhere around 120-150 hours and I still have a DLC to go through expected to be 30 hours long. I kind of play it the same way we get seasons of tv shows, once a year or so. 

Persona 5 is the same way. It’s very drawn out, very similar in ways to reading a graphic novel that prioritizes character development over battle. I put in 70 hours in January but still have 30 hours left to go whenever I decide I want to complete that story.

I just started HZD again after a two year break. My save had most of the side quests done, all main game top tier weapons unlocked, but maybe 4 or 5 main story quests left, DLC not played yet, and the save was 58 hours played making it longer than Days Gone. It’s a great game with some tense, flashy battles, but the story presentation is somewhat dull and feels drawn out. Still, those giant robots are fun to break into pieces. 

Those are the only games I have experience with from your list. I’d say go with God of War next since it’s one of the best produced games out there, and you’re guaranteed to enjoy it. I couldn’t stop playing it when I did. You’ll probably like it better than Days Gone."

DaysGone,fpclkdg,t3_gbuwlj,1588505081.0,"One thing of note about BB tank is it’s a top tier upgrade available in the last third of the game, but it locks you out from painting custom skins on the bike over BB until you can buy an equivalent size generic tank. So you get perks but lose a bit of customization to enjoy those perks."
DaysGone,fpcl523,t3_gcc25j,1588504629.0,"It was a very unhealthy obsession for me during this quarantine. It’s got a pretty well written and performed story with a ton of atmosphere. I loved riding around Oregón seeing pieces of its town, culture, and tourism all torn down and destroyed, scavenging for common items to turn into weapons. Lots of sneaking around and one man arming against small camps of looters and ambushers. There’s a whole lot of different personalities trying to lead those left over into a future worth having, and the main character is just so lost in his identity without the people he had. That said, the glitches were plentiful for me, especially with textures. I had to do a lot of full resets to get them back. The game was often so immersive but seeing a characters tattoos pixelated or a truck shaped like a paper bag would dampen the immersion. Regardless, the game has heart big enough to love, despite its imperfection."
DaysGone,fpckj53,t3_gccgyj,1588503981.0,"Was that scripted like that? I had no audio prompt acknowledging it was part of the mission so when I was using survival vision and saw 100 freakers populate out of nowhere, I thought it was another one of the games quirky (and in this case, frustrating) glitches and just booked it out of there. I was of a mind that I had no interest in fighting off hordes until the game would throw me progress on them beyond Freaker ears. Everytime i saw one before then, I ran like the horde was MrX in RE2. Was great for keeping up tension because once I realized that hordes are super easy (on normal mode) I was really let down."
DaysGone,fp9i4sp,t1_fp9i0sf,1588426801.0,"I’m more referencing the bike scenes where he’s yelling and the other characters are not. Any other point where he’s blowing up at his enemies, yelling is justified."
DaysGone,fp9hpjp,t3_gc4wdt,1588426493.0,"
Oof I’m amused you mentioned Deacon yelling. It’s one of the more immersion breaking choices they made for the game. It’s like they told Sam Whitwer, okay, these scenes all take place on a loud bike, so you’re going to have to be loud. Then they told all the other actors to just read like they were having a normal conversation. I wondered if the actors were even told what their characters were up to or what game they were going to be in. The yelling was pointless anyway because it reduced the ability to convey character nuance. 

I loved the game so much in spite of its issues. That said, It’s been so long since I played a game that was this bugged out, and it was hard to not get mad at the game. I fell through the world twice, got locked in roof geometry with no exit, and watched cutscenes where textures weren’t loaded in fully, including one where boozers tattoos weren’t loaded. The textures were the worst for the entire last third of the game, no matter whether I was in the old areas or the new. Of all the technical choices, I was really amused that I would load saves to give the game a reset but I would find bodies i killed previously lying in the road where I left them. It was really great for immersion, knowing the game saved the location of a dead wolf or a pile of marauders, but seems technically questionable for how the game stuttered or struggled. 

And I honestly don’t love the choice to hold off hordes until the end of the game. I did all of the side quests I could before moving on with any story beat, so now I have nothing left to keep the gameplay varied besides the general randomness they designed into the world. Forty hordes in a row is really draining, especially since the game emphasizes limited resources. I end up having to do a lot of boring supply runs to craft enough supplies to satisfy my playstyle. I would have been okay not knowing where every horde was at once, being allowed to earn credit for killing hordes at a lower level that I found organically. Also, the horde quests are glitched anyway. It’ll often forget I’m tracking the horde and redirect me to other locations while I’m in transit. 

Anyway, I loved the game and the story. I have several complaints still, but I played the crap out of the game non stop since I bought it last week and have nothing else to do in quarantine."

Even the way Deacon talks with his friend was rough to sit through. I liked the friend better the way they were used in the first act than the way they were characterized in the second act. I thought for a beat there Deacon wasn’t going to be friends anymore.

The environments themselves stimulated me emotionally. The story gives you purpose to go on, something to fight for.

Now if you were mentioning the studios other games, uncharted, I’d agree with your feeling of being out of place. For some reason I can’t get emotionally invested in a game about a treasure hunter trying to outhunt mercenaries for museum items. There’s so much well done in those games but I just glaze over for all of the story elements and it dampens my eagerness to play."

I spent about an hour in that history thread, so here’s a somewhat lengthy tl;dr: Guy makes a post about “wandering” through a park and wanting to score some weed. He finds a dealer and meets him at McDonalds. The dealer doesn’t even sell weed, but sold him a bit of Heroin he slipped into a small fry bag. Guy does the whole H bag the first night and writes some “it’s a revelation” post on iAmA. It changed his life, he’s so glad he tried it, but it’ll be “just this once.” Well, that was a lie. Two weeks later he updated that he’s already lost his girlfriend and it sounds like he’s losing days too. Guy gets a lot of feedback calling him stupid and telling him to stop. Some feedback is rather poetic. Look out for The Jaime story. It’s about a girl who was the top of her class but moving away for six months, comes back a shell of a woman trying to get her girlfriend back. The girlfriend drives her to rehab and says sign up, but Jaime says “the drug has given her more than her girlfriend ever could.” The girlfriend leaves her at rehab and the poster ends with “I loved that girl.” Everyone else rallies around the message, but Guy is very confident in his drug management and brushed off the majority of advice he’s getting. Now there’s a post where a year has passed, he just died from a FENTANYL and narcotic mixture, but was brought to life confused in a hospital. A lot of his truth comes out in this post. He had been trying other hard drugs leading up to his initial post, but was still able to write a mostly sane post that convinced us he was intelligent but had made a mistake. He goes on in a post to list off some of the most exotic designer drugs you’ve ever heard that he tried in a six week bender. It reads like a full blown chemistry lesson. Going through this post, you get the sense the guy is both more willing to tell his truth than he initially let on, and is also maybe somewhat of an embellisher. He was apparently a top of the line Ivy League design student dabbling in architecture, graphic design, and some snow sport. So he has hobbies too, but nearly died from chewing used fentanyl pads and falling asleep with them in his mouth. He’s in a nice little psych ward now waiting for his personal laptop so he can stop sharing with that one random Asian guy in the ward and can relax with some reddit and make dubstep beats. He’s very convinced he’s bipolar and that helps explain his serious substance abuse problem. After about six days in the psych ward he goes to rehab. Seven years after rehab he ends up on r/opiate recovery and tells a story of success. He has been drug free for six years and life is going well for him. There’s not much more to the update than that he found narcotics anonymous and a sponsor in rehab. There’s one dark comment below though that says they remember reading Guy’s post seven years ago and it helped motivate them to try heroin, and they’ve been using it that whole time, with no personal recovery. Guy doesn’t personally respond to many of the messages in his farewell thread, so we all have to decide for ourselves what to believe and what not to believe, knowing that drug addicts mix truth and lies in equal parts. 

A riveting tale, but I hope the OP truly has recovered. Regardless, we have a great tale of loving Heroin and having your soul ripped out of you. There is no out of body experience when you die, it’s just a black void, he says. And none of this would have been written without the use of heroin."

Why is this guy getting millions of views for something billions of other non-white people do all the time? I don’t know if I’m overreacting but he literally orders egg rolls in mandarin “as a white person,” and that’s his career.

Edit: I see I’m getting downvoted for the initial comment so I’d like to clarify again that I think it’s very wonderful to learn a second language and I’m impressed when a native mandarin/Cantonese speaker learns English and vice versa because the languages are so incredibly different and don’t use a similar alphabet. My issue with this creator is that he constantly captions “white guy speaking to Chinese people” and he keeps getting clicks and views , not for being a guy, but for being a white guy. He could caption himself as “American speaks perfect Chinese,” or “Native English speaker orders in perfect Chinese,” and it would emphasize that he’s taking credit for engaging in other cultures, but no, he’s taking credit for being a “white guy” doing this. I’m white myself but that doesn’t make me special for learning a second language. It’s just really insulting to other cultures who learn our language and people barely give them credit because they have an accent or limited vocabulary, but when white people mumble out a coherent sentence in another language, we’re like “applaud and celebrate that, whitey.”"

It’s unfortunate you feel unattractive because I’d probably objectify you from a distance and, being gay, know there’s no chance greater than enjoying the view. So no, you’re not ugly. Though, it wasn’t a great idea to lead with that particular back picture. I’m sure you could find better lighting. Every other picture really works for you."

The mind control is on a timer but it tends to pick enemies that have been stalled for some time. I believe bosses are immune, and it has a secret usage where if the enemy revives or has their own mind control power, the secondary enemies permanently become on your side until they die. Also if the last enemy of the final wave is mind controlled, the winner screen pops up and you can move on."

PS4Deals,erzsybs,t3_c4pk82,1561449819.0,"Absolutely one of my favorite games. 

The story is not extremely in your face most of the time. It’s a game like Half-Life where you keep control through cut scenes and find story beats through discovery and digging. You might hear about one character’s involvement with a project, then find their office, hack their email, then discover a big secret. The level design is always super intricate and requires back tracking as you unlock keys or power ups that make areas become accessible, sometimes through different methods. For instance a room may be accessed by high level hacking or a late level skill that lets you mimic smaller objects or a tech skill that shrinks large obstructions to usable material. The vibe is often tense as the space station is lacking in friendly characters and enemies travel in unpredictable patterns, all while resources are often limited or vary in usefulness depending on the character build. There’s all kinds of secret areas hidden about, sometimes behind futuristic 3D screens, or behind locked doors that take some creative nerf gunning to unlock (pro tip: computer screens and unlock buttons can be nerf darted). 

All in all, this game is perfect for fans of games like System Shock, Bioshock, or Dishonored. It’s an extremely well made game, but I could see how it’s somewhat slower pacing could fail to hook people who are less patient. Give it some time because it really rewards people who love to explore, tinker, and feel like a space detective."
