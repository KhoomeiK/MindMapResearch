YandhiLeaks,fnjpl81,t1_f6wtz2x,1587004065.0,I was thinking the same thing when I started trying to figure out the lyrics of this outro
CapitalismVSocialism,fllvnu5,t3_fpm5wg,1585268709.0,"Rights come from God/nature. I saw someone say rights are a social construct, but the fact is, in nature there is minimal hierarchy (besides natural hierarchy based on intelligence and strength) and everyone has free will. I see “rights” as the allowance of free will (in the bill of rights applies to 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th kinda), while the rest are allowances provided by government. They don’t relate to free will because governments were created by man, not nature, and our government was built on consent of governed, so they made a few small “rights” to keep the people from rebelling. Just my confused political opinion."

depression,f8ww828,t1_f8wq9cl,1574901606.0,"The CBD is “RA Hemp” indica for sleeping, and I take up to 20 mg of melatonin but they recommend 5. Only thing is I’ve taken way too much in the past and had really weird dreams. But it works like a charm if you take enough."
depression,f8wlxao,t1_f8vmr0a,1574893873.0,"I’m like that, where I can’t shut off my brain and can’t sleep a lot. What works for me is CBD drops and an insane amount of melatonin"
