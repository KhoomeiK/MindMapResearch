Its not the neo-nazis that scare me, we all know they are full of shit. It's the identity politics and self imposed social rules, stupid people don't see the danger in promoting it. Tell a stupid person to gas all the jews okay thats a little radical. Tell a stupid person they need to follow a guideline to interfact with anyone slightly different from them, and they listen!

I would say they were more centrist if anything, coming for a better life of well grilled potatoes. Not to mention the jazz and blues influences on country and bluegrass from black people, the Auth rights kryptonite. And the Grateful Dead, a Liberal icon, was heavily heavily influenced by bluegrass. For the most part in my opinion the genre can be seen from laissez-faire then to more commie-communes now. 

Today contemporary bluegrass, usually called new grass, and other more niche genres, have been absolutely been ultra hippified if you will, whereas the authright's presence in the genres is almost nonexistent. But if there is nationalist bluegrass I'd love a link!

Can't even go on Facebook anymore, the fake news and boomer bullshit is terrible for my mental health. The last round of ultra conservative abortion laws spawned so many memes about democrats eating babies i can't take the time to try and correct them. Just hope their ignorance finishes them off before we are too far gone. How so many extremely poor and uneducated people fight against themselves is beyond me."

(a few years ago) I'm sure the dark web has a plethora of outrageousness, but I'm not that curious nor do I want to be on the governments radar lol."
