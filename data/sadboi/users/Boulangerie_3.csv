ptsd,f1dkbzg,t1_f1azz0i,1569387253.0,You are so kind to say that.  One day I will.   Best to you in all you do!
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,f1aqy4l,t3_d7zccu,1569303236.0,"My pleasure.  You will make it through.   My kid now has a voice through the ARC attorney.  He has a voice of truth that no one can deny.  He is on the spectrum and he is just genuine to the core.   All the suffering my children saw me go through during that 8 month period has been redeemed by the fact he has been through 5 different girlfriends all over lapping with the first girlfriend actually moving in  with the kids 3 months after our divorce finalized for 6 months. Then the normal children I have bonded like normal kids do to the lovely woman (who I actually thought was a nice person) and he cheats and dumps her.  

Continue to be consistent and be there when you are able.  Keep fighting for the truth.   

Children know unconditional love and despite the sadness this divorce caused me- the breakdown was the ONLY way I would have escaped.  

When I lost legal and physical custody because my breakdown, I felt that the only constant was my faith.   It was the only thing left.   I remember sitting all alone in a cupcake bar where we went with the Nex present (to supervise). Yes, they made him supervisor of me.   He then took the children back to our former house for my kid‚Äôs birthday cake and told me I was not welcome.  It was so so wrong what he put me through, but now he is living a taste of what he put me through.   

Nex is fighting to get more time with our kid but my kid is going at his pace and standing his ground with another month of 2 nights a month.  Scary to know the punishment from Dad will come out passive aggressively, but the kid is smart and amazing.   

I have truly seen time reveal what is true.  People may not see through a narcissist‚Äôs persona, but with truth on your side it will turn around.  It will.   Sometimes it can be awhile but it‚Äôs worth the fight.  The kids are worth the effort and they know.   Stay strong."
ptsd,f1aoxds,t3_d8cluv,1569300953.0,"I feel I am, but I feel very sad about it because I feel I have a lot of love and kindness to share.   I am afraid no one will come to my funeral besides my kids and my sisters.   

I want to be surrounded by people who truly love me in my last moments on earth.  I would be so sad to die alone in a hospital bed or with a hospice nurse.  I want to form a loving relationship with a healthy partner and get married to a normal man and to have deep friendships,   Trauma has put this invisible wall between me and my feelings as though I never belong.  Then when I think I belong I step back and I really never quite belong.  

It‚Äôs a terrible feeling to always feel you are watching life.  I want to live it."
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,f16pdpc,t3_d81agp,1569219393.0,"Thanks for your support and reality check.   Some times I can not wrap my mind around the complete lack of empathy in this nex.  Zero.   It makes me sad, but it was good to see my children are beginning to respond in more mature and caring and empathetic ways despite what they witnessed growing up."
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,f16hz9i,t3_d7zccu,1569213182.0,"I did experience that 3 years ago after a complete breakdown after 2 decades of daily emotional abuse and some physical abuse.  

Then the day out of the hospital 3 years ago after he threatened me, he vacated me from our then home and filed an emergency vacate order that I was mentally ill and made up things that I had said to the children.   He lied to the Judge, the school, the police etc.   I was devastated.  A guardian ad litem and a police officer filed a false report that I said the nex hit me that night of the breakdown.   I never did.  The NEX said that I made a false report to the officer.   So finally after 8 months they investigated and interviewed the children.  Nothing NEX said aligned with the truth and what the children shared all matched the events from the therapists etc.  I got custody back.  Jump 6 months ago.  Nex is found to be abusing our kid and like what happened to me denies it.  Says kid has a disability so he can not read social cues.  It‚Äôs like a full circle.  

Finally someone listened to my kid and it‚Äôs clear that I was completely smeared in the past.   I have severe PTSD as my child is suffering through this.  Kid was appointed an attorney and has a voice to say what happened.   It is still a nightmare, but keep your truth and in the strangest way and saddest way, truth always prevails in the end.  It took another bad event but it was a moment to go into full protection mode for my children.   Stay strong.  I‚Äôm so sorry you are experiencing one of the most painful things a mother or father can experience when not the abuser.   I was naive to think that in front of a Judge with his right hand up to God he would lie.  To betray his own wife at the time and see the police brutally assault me as he stood there not doing anything because he told the police I ‚Äúmisused the police‚Äù and had tried to get a restraining order numerous times always failing.   That was my first ever call to 911 and I was terrified.  Even more traumatized after they did not help me and put me in 4 point restraints to the mental hospital.  He threw me under the bus and used the children as pawns to save himself.   No one believed me but I think that some people realize what he is after he did this to my kid.  

Keep strong and it may be a long fight to the truth, but it will happen.   It can happen."
NarcissisticAbuse,f0vwsku,t3_d6hmzm,1568993677.0,It‚Äôs team ‚Äúme‚Äù and it‚Äôs in a good and healthy sense.  You are definitely worthy and there will be so many other wonderful things coming your way when you are not in an environment where everything is criticized.   You are smart and successful and all the things he discounted you on.   Wishing all good things for you!   It‚Äôs hard but it‚Äôs because you have a heart.
NarcissisticAbuse,f0vwftl,t3_d6ou4k,1568993433.0,Think bubble around you.  Nothing can touch you.  His words hit your bubble and zap the are gone.   I‚Äôll be thinking of you .  Sorry you are suffering.  It does get much better.  Planning is key.  Get someone to help you with a safety plan.
NarcissisticAbuse,f0uyah3,t3_d6hmzm,1568955165.0,I think for me because he could not truly bond and feel with me that is the root to why nothing of true meaning has clung to me.  No special memories come to mind.  Everything seems so blah and bland and it was always me not measuring up to his standards.  At some point- I think 10 years into the marriage I started to realize he was the one who was the unhealthy one.  All those years of trying harder and harder.  It just burns a human being out and snuff your soul.   I think therapy and getting reality checks helped a lot.  Then a lot of grieving for myself.  For not realizing my worth all those years.   I also look at him and feel sorry for him and I met his girlfriend once and I felt bad for her because she had no clue.   I believe because they can not truly attach emotionally to us is that disconnect.  It feels like dissociation but perhaps it‚Äôs more the fact that the bond was only trauma based.
NarcissisticAbuse,f0uxo3c,t3_d6ou4k,1568954470.0,"Sounds like me.  I ended up having a break down.  Start planning your escape.  Start attending a support group or a domestic violence support counselor to walk you through.  It is extremely scary, but it CAN be done.  I am divorced at the unfortunate cost of my mental health.   Do all you can to find organizations and tell friends what is really going on.  Don‚Äôt protect him anymore.  Save yourself.  You deserve to be in s happy and safe and loving environment.   I know it‚Äôs easier said than done.  Sadly, I might still have stayed but the hospital would not let me return home.  Then he kicked me out and took the kids but that worked out in the end as well.  It all comes back what he did to me.  He will never change.  You can.  I wish you will be safe and get out."
NarcissisticAbuse,f0ux7sr,t3_d6kyso,1568953971.0,I tried to say to him at the end of the marriage ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt talk to you if you are yelling at me but will when you can use a normal speaking voice.‚Äù Then I would leave the room or hang up the phone.  If it means getting in your car to a hotel or friends to feel safe then that‚Äôs what I did.   Sometimes it might mean more serious help if you feel in danger.
NarcissisticAbuse,f0uwtax,t3_d6ggkk,1568953537.0,I get scared I can not tell if he has narc traits and at times he does.  I keep going back and forth and need to set boundaries and continue to be friends before jumping into anything.   It‚Äôs hard because the person becomes a companion and best friend.  I just need to heal more so I can tell if it‚Äôs my ptsd or bad behavior or the bf.  I realize at times I am more sensitive so it‚Äôs a slow process getting back to dating and trusting myself.
NarcissisticAbuse,f0uwfos,t3_d6odv8,1568953137.0,17 years.  Absolutely no tears on his part.  No emotional connection.  No empathy.  Just new girlfriend after new girlfriend.  I feel like he is a stranger.  He was so disconnected to me and always told me it was me.  Then after this happened I was so mentally drained I feel now I cannot connect with people at this point.  I keep to myself and feel limited with people but still a target for the narc type.  I‚Äôm trying hard to recover but it‚Äôs up and down.   Keep reading more about narcissistic people and it will continue to help you not blame yourself any more like I did.
NarcissisticAbuse,f0uvuma,t3_d6k1dd,1568952528.0,"Happy Birthday and I must say I am proud of you for the courage you had for realizing it early enough.  I spent 17 years with a controlling jerk and no loving feelings of kindness or warmth in return.  It really kills your spirit.  So despite the pain now, with healing and support around you , you will thrive again.  I‚Äôm still getting there but it‚Äôs better away from him.  I can think.  I am allowed to buy a 4 dollar purchase.  I can hang a piece of art on the wall.  My cooking is not ridiculed.  I‚Äôm not his emotional toy.  You are worthy of someone treating with kindness and respect.  I‚Äôm still getting there but It‚Äôs easier to give advice and see it than when one is in it.  You are so strong.  You saved your self and your sanity.  Proud of you."
NarcissisticAbuse,f0uveai,t1_f0utfew,1568952070.0,I‚Äôm so sorry you went through that.  I froze a lot.  I got kicked out into the guest bedroom.  I would be the one to leave to a hotel after an incident.  Then he visited me at the hotel to say he wanted to reconcile.  Of course I believed him then the abuse got worse and I tried to get a restraining order but he lied.  Then his attorney asked the Judge to ask me if my husband at the time stayed at the hotel to visit me.  I said yes.  Then the attorney said ‚Äú this is a divorce tactic‚Äù and the judge said ‚ÄúHow can I give you a restraining order if you were with him two months ago‚Äù which was the last time I ever was.  From that moment he just tortured me until I broke down and was hospitalized from his constant emotional abuse and my dog disappeared on Mother‚Äôs Day.  I thought I was going to be next.
LifeAfterNarcissism,f0uup21,t1_f0us5m6,1568951380.0,Thanks .  I think that is a good point.  I‚Äôve been quite sad and don‚Äôt want to talk about it with anyone in town because I initially tried to share what was happening and I ended up with a full mental collapse after he started the gaslighting.  Then then he made up lies to the town so I feel I can not defend myself without knowing what he said besides I went crazy etc. I will try focusing on my healing like I have so I can start feeling more open to people and not so scared.
LifeAfterNarcissism,f0sulko,t3_d69b6m,1568910879.0,Aww I am so glad you had some anchors.  My best friend did not understand narc abuse and was begging me to save the marriage.  I can not seem to get out there but it‚Äôs nice to read that you are holding on and those core supports stayed.  I‚Äôll keep working on things and get out there again .
ptsd,f0km8a4,t3_d51bvy,1568682499.0,"I am so sorry to hear you are going through this.  Every day gets better, and the fact is you still carry all the beautiful things within you.  I have setbacks and still isolate but the fact is I have healed a lot through therapy and EMDR was also helpful.   The sparkle will return and everything you are as well is there.  It‚Äôs just in there healing for a bit and emotionally when you are ready it will happen.   Wishing you lots of good things, and know you are not alone.   Thanks for sharing your struggles."
NarcissisticAbuse,f0b26x5,t3_d4f0ce,1568521615.0,So far only out 2 years.  Started hurting my kid instead then denied it saying it was his disability which made him perceive 5-6 separate incidents as not ‚Äúabuse‚Äù.   It‚Äôs painful beyond belief but at least because of this sad situation he got his IEP reinstated.   Of course nex blames me and kid rather than take ownership.   So sorry that your kids are being used as pawns.   Perhaps having in stipulation that only certain people can care for them during vacations to protect them.  Best to you.
NarcissisticAbuse,f0aerxl,t3_d4579b,1568513880.0,"Thanks for sharing.  I am attempting to go NC to a bf for the tenth breakup to same person in 2 years - hopefully last time.  I have finally reached the point that he makes me sad to be around all the time.  

I was married for 17 years to a narc sociopath so this guy seemed 100x better but still a narc is a narc.   I am going through a hard time and know the feeling well.  You will be okay.  The trauma bond is strong and I know how hard this is.   Wishing you all good things."
ptsd,f039w3n,t3_d3bqj3,1568348941.0,Not at all.  The combination of meds and therapy is the best.  You deserve to feel better.
ptsd,f039rst,t3_d390cn,1568348831.0,Thanks for sharing.  You are doing amazing and glad you have a a wonderful partner to support you!
ptsd,f039fy6,t3_d399xm,1568348528.0,I‚Äôm so glad you are able to go to therapy.   I hope your session went well.
ptsd,f0393wl,t3_d3fl74,1568348239.0,"I‚Äôm sorry to hear that.  I reached a complete breakdown after years of an abusive marriage, but the worst case scenario brought about my way out of the marriage.   Progress comes in small ways for me, and setbacks but it is getting better.   There is hope."
ptsd,f0380cw,t3_d3buxs,1568347344.0,That is great!!
ptsd,f02f87n,t1_ezzh4rq,1568329393.0,Thanks so much !!
ptsd,f02f6me,t1_ezzx19b,1568329364.0,That‚Äôs really accurate about not having to understand the trigger but to show some empathy would have been nice versus having his tantrum.
ptsd,f02f2ax,t1_ezzniv7,1568329283.0,Thanks so much for your support!!
ptsd,f02f14i,t1_f029b29,1568329261.0,So true!  I think my ex was so much worse that despite this ‚Äúimprovement ‚Äú I am realizing it gets better than the minimum I am accepting of a bf.   Thanks for your support!
ptsd,f02evmj,t1_ezzmblz,1568329156.0,Thanks so much.  ‚ÄúBarnyard behavior‚Äù. made me laugh.  Thanks for your advice and for your support!!   It is all about respect.  I agree.   This helps me a lot .  Thanks!!
ptsd,f02ep79,t1_f026veq,1568329042.0,I can not think when he gets angry.  Thanks for your comment and sharing
ptsd,f02em7i,t1_ezzwm1w,1568328988.0,I do get frozen a lot with him and notice I cry a lot.  I don‚Äôt deserve that and it makes me sad to realize that I would never tolerate anyone I know to tolerate what I did before or now.   Every day I‚Äôm getting better and learning to remove myself from this situation.   Thanks so much for your comments!
ptsd,f02ed0z,t1_f01ybxz,1568328820.0,That is so true.  I would be the same.   Thanks so much for your comment!!
ptsd,f02ea0k,t1_f00989j,1568328764.0,Aha!  I really appreciate your comment.  I think you said it really really well!  I freeze and cry with him in other situations and I really need to respect myself more to not keep going back.  It is a cycle.  He hasn‚Äôt apologized for the food incident last night still but he has been trying to be normal again for now.   Thanks so much for taking time to comment everyone.   I appreciate it so much.
ptsd,f02dszy,t1_ezzh924,1568328508.0,Thanks so much!   I feel less crazy about the incident now!!
ptsd,ezzmqqd,t1_ezzizj9,1568289559.0,Thank you for telling me that I deserve better.   It is hard to tell him what I do not like without him getting angry.   I am trying hard to leave but keep going back.   I appreciate your advice.
ptsd,ezzh0sq,t1_ezzf1so,1568286803.0,I was quiet and polite when I asked him to please ask before taking because it triggered me.   Then when I felt badly and attempted to put said food on his plate he got irate and shoved it off the plate onto the table.   I feel sad because I think you‚Äôre right that it was uncalled for.
ptsd,ezzgnlw,t1_ezzg139,1568286625.0,I appreciate your feedback.   I felt like you do but when he became insistent that if I was going the one to make a big deal of eating things off my plate - that I was picking a fight was confusing.  I politely asked him to please ask me before reaching over and taking my food.   Thanks so much.
