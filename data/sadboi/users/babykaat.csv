BipolarReddit,f7dmgn1,t1_f7dhiil,1573621280.0,agreed. i tried to explain it to a friend earlier but these drugs really are life saving. i think sometimes we forget that because they aren‚Äôt medicines for physical illnesses!

bipolar,f0f8e18,t3_d4bcy1,1568579505.0,omg these are my absolute favorite things to do when manic. i was going thru a really bad episode this summer and my dad bought me a couple to help with my energy levels. my best friend stayed in with me all summer doing it. its now hanging in my dads office and always proudly tells people his daughter made it haha :-)

bipolar2,evssv9y,t3_cl4g94,1564755423.0,i recently experienced this where i became obssessed with my sexuality. however even when i came out of the episode i was still feeling many of the same things and ended up coming out as bisexual! i guess its kind of a happy story in regards to my bipolar disorder since it helped me discover who i truly am. i would say wait and see how you feel once its over! :-)
BipolarReddit,evi9r2m,t1_evhydvm,1564539205.0,wanting to share my experience with other people does not equal being an attention whore. i‚Äôve learned that a lot of people genuinely want to understand. calling people attention whores for doing so is uncalled for.

BipolarReddit,euakxju,t1_eua7ehh,1563623411.0,i‚Äôve tried these before and they definitely help! sometimes its just hard to remember them in the moment :-)
BipolarReddit,eu65u5u,t3_cewo2y,1563492807.0,lack of resources/education. my huge public library has 1 book on bipolar disorder. and its on how to deal with someone who has it. that and people don‚Äôt always experience symptoms of bd or schizo but most experience anxiety or depression.
bipolar2,etvzajw,t3_cdrpo1,1563248828.0,definitely experienced this. i have more than a few friends with bipolar disorder along with an ex boyfriend. i seem to attract people with very similar issues as me.
BipolarReddit,et69aop,t3_ca36zl,1562507347.0,"this isnt exactly the same as yours but i have been asking myself similar questions. i was born with a brain abnormality in my cerebellum. when my physical health started to get bad around age 13, my mental health also deteriorated. for years i thought nothing of it. recently when i discussed it with my psychiatrist she pointed me to some studies being done relating issues with the cerebellum to bipolar disorder. for TBIs, i‚Äôm sure there must be a connection. i would definitely see if there are any studies available online or talk to your psych if you can! wishing you well."
BipolarReddit,et31bww,t3_c9ulyl,1562426331.0,"hi, im 19f with bd2. i graduated high school a year ago and can relate to a lot of what you‚Äôre saying. i was never popular at school but outside of class i had plenty of friends. i did wild shit 24/7 which i now attribute in part to my bd. i was diagnosed at 18, right before i graduated. however as soon as my 19th birthday hit, everything got a lot worse. by this point i had stopped partying and going out and had a much smaller amount of friends. that part doesn‚Äôt make me upset anymore because i realized how toxic my lifestyle was back then. however, i lost who i was. at 19 thats probably normal. regardless, the worsening of my bd made figuring out who i truly was much harder than the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù 19 year old in college. im still figuring it out. this illness sucks and i often dont recognize myself looking in the mirror. i hope you find peace and stability üíú"
BipolarReddit,esxyw5s,t3_c9cziw,1562336952.0,"a few months ago i was extremely worried that i had a warrant for something small i had done manic months prior. i was trying to get pulled over, doing background checks on myself, and was convinced they had my plate numbers. while i was extremely anxious, i realized it was just paranoia causing that anxiety. so i definitely agree with the other comments. a lot of the time its paranoia causing the anxiety we feel. best of luck to you üíõ"

BipolarReddit,eshkfq2,t1_eshgtxz,1561995066.0,"thank you for commenting this! 12 psych visits a year sounds great tbh. my psych and therapist are on months long waiting lists. pharmecuitical companies in the US are ridiculously powerful and use that to raise prices, its disgusting. with the lack of leadership willing to fight for low med prices we‚Äôre pretty much stuck paying an arm and a leg to these big pharma companies. for those uninsured i can only imagine how much worse it is."

BipolarReddit,es3plv1,t1_es3ncf2,1561567898.0,"i‚Äôve noticed that as well. personally living in the US and seeing the problems first hand as well as watching the political debates over it every day, it‚Äôs an extremely complex system that works for those who can afford it. its incredibly frustrating."

bipolar,erzy36u,t1_erzlrn2,1561457860.0,i can see why you would think that. and i‚Äôm not saying i‚Äôve been going from episode to episode within days rather than saying my mood has been very unstable. i‚Äôve been switching/adjusting meds all month. i‚Äôve been threatened with hospitalization twice this month with psychotic episodes that had me with scissors to my wrist and unaware of it. i wouldn‚Äôt consider any of that normal.

bipolar2,ery5j6a,t3_c4rkac,1561400892.0,my family has a history of bipolar disorder and mental illness in general but there was definitely a few things that i think set it off. i was bullied/singled out a lot in middle school which left me with practically no friends. eventually i began self harming and was contemplating suicide at the age of 12. somehow i was bullied for that as well. by 13 i was diagnosed with depression and GAD and was put on antidepressants that i repeatedly took myself off of. definitely a red flag now that i look back on it. once my junior year hit i got heavily involved in drugs and thats pretty much when i consider my bipolar disorder really starting to make itself known. overall i‚Äôd consider it a mix of the trauma of being bullied for mental illness and the excessive drug use in my high school years!
