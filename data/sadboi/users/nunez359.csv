EnneagramType2,ficaq92,t3_f7e2bs,1582341887.0,"I am a 2 and my partner is a 5. In the beginning of our relationship, we had a lot of communication problems, especially when discussing the future. Time, intentionality, and commitment proved to be on our side, and we are very happy. Now actively talking about next steps, marriage, family, the like. We needed to commit to learning how to better love each other and what the other needed, in order to find our good rhythm."

EnneagramType2,fc1s8ai,t3_efl19i,1577328079.0,2’s and 8’s are typically very compatible. The balance of the opposites makes for a pretty healthy relationship from what I’ve seen in many couples. Be patient and appreciative and true to yourself while allowing them to be true to themselves.

EnneagramType2,f7eay65,t1_f7e4jz1,1573652685.0,"I agree. Past experience might have built some walls up for him, too.

I’m a 2 that has been notorious for moving TOO fast in relationships, jumping in heart-first, head-wayyy-later. My last relationship did some damage and caused me to take my current relationship at a much slower pace with lots of guards up. 

If it’s not personality, it might be circumstantial. Let him open up to you! And good luck!"

Anxiety,f74jbab,t3_dubotu,1573403340.0,That's the sympathetic nervous system response you're feeling (fight or flight) because the anxiety convinces us we're in danger when we're not. When your exhalation is longer than your inhalation your heart rate slows down and the parasympathetic nervous system starts to engage. Be kind to yourself.
