SuicideWatch,etp5kiu,t3_ccr77a,1563046327.0,"Hey I know it's hard to surpress everything and don't be able to relieve yourself but there are tons of people who are understanding u perfectly fine and even more people that want to help u, so don't jump to a conclusion at the first steps and try to take a few more steps but in a different way 
u noticed that surpressing everything and waiting for everything to end and be normal is a painful way, so why don't try new ones and talk to people who are understanding u completely
I myself don't know if I can understand u completely but it's worth a try don't you think? Just try talking with someone or more people at onces if u need to and they will help u get better 
So choose u're way mateüí™üèª"

He is pierced and tatood, but one of the friendliest guys i've ever met."
