mentalhealth,fgtvx7o,t1_fgsfnp7,1581110093.0,"If you feel you're getting nowhere with your current GP I would definitely try another practice if you can. I'm awaiting counselling sessions from a place called Talk, for this service I self referred. I know they do GP referrals too but I preferred to do things on my terms, if you look into counselling services in your area it should hopefully give an option to self refer."
mentalhealth,fgrpc6t,t3_f04afn,1581053118.0,"Whenever I've had a mental health appointment I will make notes in my phone beforehand of what emotions and thoughts I'm experiencing. I find it much easier to read from a bulletpoint list rather than feel as though I'm on the spot trying to explain, it also helps avoid making light of the situation. 
Once I went to the GP when I was feeling suicidal and was told to try aromatherapy, I understand how frustrating it is to have the severity of your feelings brushed aside but in that instance I requested to see another doctor unit I felt I was being treated by somebody who would actually listen.
Depending on what area you live in I would look into counselling services that are avaliable on the NHS. There are waiting lists but you will be having sessions with somebody who is fully equipped and experienced in dealing with mental health issues."
DeadBedrooms,fgnob6c,t1_fgmg3h9,1580949268.0,"I completely feel the same in regards to wondering if there's a hidden truth and having an otherwise honest and upfront relationship.
I try to think of possible reasons but end up circling the drain. If it was physical or mental like ED I would be patient and support him, but it's difficult to support what you don't know. If it's that he's simply not attracted to me in that way I'd have to deal with it. I'd just rather know than wait however many weeks, months or years down the line to find out."

It takes time to find your feet, especially when it's doing something out of your comfort zone.
See this job as a jumping off point, a temporary job that you are no means trapped in, it's a means to an end for the time being.
It's difficult but try to tough it out, I really hope these feeling don't last for you.

It's difficult to not worry if you're breathing 'right' when you're having a panic attack so try your best not to overthink it.
A distraction always helps, whether it's listening to or watching something.

Most importantly remember this feeling won't last, although it's uncomfortable and can feel very scary you will be okay. I've taken to thinking 'oh shit I'm having a brain blip' and remembering to give myself however long it takes to just breathe and let it pass."
