Art,f8i8uxi,t1_f8dn955,1574585703.0,Thank you!
Art,f8i8pao,t1_f8doqws,1574585627.0,Thank you. And the quote is spot on. I might write it on my drawing.

Art,f8i7a3n,t1_f8dmynk,1574585223.0,"Thanks! I'm trying new ways to improve my drawings. And using gold and a bit of shading is a step in the right direction, I think. Because until very recently I only used black ink and nothing else. I'm not that great with colours :)."

Art,f8ehrpb,t1_f8dq9da,1574527886.0,"Sorry, was away from phone and pc. For a pack of 15 leafs (15Ã—15cm) I pay almost 50 euros. And in this drawing I used around half a leaf (1.5 euros, around that sum)."
Art,f8egzan,t1_f8e5g8q,1574527429.0,I don't know if there is a name for it (I guess it must have one). I've just started using goldleafs in my ink drawings.
Art,f8egjgs,t1_f8eg4pw,1574527176.0,Color in the negative space with a bit of shading. I use a 0.1 liner and a 2B pencil and some Qtips to soften the edges.

bipolar,etsmc04,t1_etsks1o,1563149430.0,Yup. I hate it when I get a wifeban on my wallet.  But I also know that she is doing me a favor.
bipolar,etsf1ts,t1_etsaa6o,1563143913.0,"One thing that I learned from being a bipolar in academia is to have patience and not deal in absolutes. I don't want to tell you how many papers I've had rejected or how many deadlines for grants or conferences I've missed. And every time the world would collapse around me and I wanted to end it all. After a paper rejected that I worked on for almost a year I tried to kill myself, but luckly for me my sister came around my place at just the right moment to save me. A while latter, after I could think straight, I said to myself: you know what, fuck all this pressure and all their deadlines. Even if I make less money and not fast track my carrer, my life isn't worth giving up for this stupid system of publish or perish. I'll take my time, work on things that I have an interes in, not what is fancy and trending in my field and keep an eye out for far enough deadlines such that I can work at my own pace. 
So my advice is not to see this September deadline as a make it or break it type of deal. When I had to pause my phd I did all sorts of small jobs, from mcdonalds to call centers just to make enough to feed myself. I missed my healthy self that could do physics, but I knew that this was just a period and it will pass. So if you dont find something by september, get another job and take your time till you find the right place for you. Your life is not defined or given meaning by the job you do or the title you have."
bipolar,ets8dzf,t1_ets7eqm,1563139058.0,"I feel you, this is why I'm in my 6th year of my PhD. Even if I took some years off, I just couldn't quit it and find something else to do. I wanted to be a researcher/professor since I was very young. So I'll never quit even if it hurts me in the long run."
bipolar,ets7w3y,t1_ets790w,1563138709.0,I'm the same with sleep and deaths. Unfortunately you can only control one. Also moving from once place to another is a thing that gets me off balance. I had my second psychotic episode when I moved from my home town to go to university.

raidsecrets,ess8tyw,t1_ess8dl9,1562247344.0,Think you got it wrong. I was talking about myself. I didnt know before you told me that a masterworked chalice gives the catalyst on the first go. So I assumed that my luck on getting the ship ran out when I got the catalyst.
raidsecrets,ess7uu1,t1_ess7mam,1562246743.0,There you go. This is what happens when you make assumptions without knowing all the details. I tried to play the worlds smallest violin but failed.
raidsecrets,ess6m3x,t3_c90qf8,1562245991.0,"Mhm, given that I got Izanagis catalyst on my very first run of heroic menagerie I'll probably not see the ship in the lifetime of Destiny."
bipolar,epvod58,t1_epv7jp1,1559542283.0,"I always give away what I draw. If a person really likes it, why ask for money? To see the joy and appreciation is payment enough. Also considering I do this as a hobby, I would feel awkward to ask for money."
bipolar,eptp8o1,t1_eptndto,1559494832.0,"Yup, I showed my therapist this. She was pround because for the first time since forever I was able to express something using a gradient, even if its a transition from black to white. She said that Im starting to get in touch with other suppressed emotions. To see the shades of gray in the daily life. Up to this point my world view was monochromatic."
bipolar,ept7bgo,t1_ept4vnf,1559483575.0,With a black ink liner (from Micron).
bipolar,ept3ggv,t1_epsykd9,1559480354.0,"Thanks. I keep drawing, its a part of my therapy. I also have trouble expressing and understanding emotions (childhood traumas, etc.). And after each session I go home with homework. To draw an emotion or to sketch what we talked about that day."
bipolar,ept370m,t1_epswnn1,1559480064.0,"Thank you, thats what I was trying to represent. It may seem that the black and white are opposite but they can also be interchangeable. Depends on how you look at them. Sometimes I find beauty in my depression and something ugly in mania. With a blur and shades of grey in my ""normal"" days."
bipolar,ept2uwk,t1_epszrqi,1559479693.0,About a day and a half of continuous work. With a couple of snack breaks here and there.
