When I was in high school, I chose depression as my topic for my project (which was like a booklet) and wrote all about my feelings in the book. I was praised for the assignment and asked to share it with the next class as an example of what they could do.

Now my sister, on the other hand, wrote about something concerning and the teacher called my mom about it. My mom took my sister to therapy as a result. So sometimes an adult can see the problem. But I know it’s not the norm.

But I feel like he couldn’t see the broken parts inside of me that I was desperately trying to describe, but obviously failed to convey. These broken things kept me from being able to just get up and dust myself off. This deep mortal injury was keeping me from being able to succeed. It was invisible to them. But it was the problem.

Christianity,fjykwli,t1_fjyinun,1583698952.0,"I am leaning a bit toward your views over the past few years but I’m still *not* fully sure right now. Sometimes I think about how my parents believe all the “bad” people are going to hell and it saddens me deeply. Then I think how so many other people in the church believe and even teach the same thing. If I were to believe in Christian Universalism, I think it’s a wonderful belief that truly is good news...But I quickly remember that I’d be ostracized because of it. It’s a lonely belief. There aren’t many churches (or any really) around me that believe Christian Universalism. I would have to go to church and hide this belief because I’d be considered a heretic otherwise. Do I want to go to a church where my fellow members would think me a heretic if they knew what I really believed? Do I try to accept hell so that I can belong? I don’t know - just thinking out loud...."
Christianity,fjyk2z5,t1_fjyh6nr,1583698452.0,"Thank you. I am trying to look into other views. In fact, I thought God showed me another possibility, but I’m not ready to say for sure yet....I just don’t understand how Christians can believe in eternal conscious torment. I feel alone in considering other possibilities but I have to try to remember I am not alone. I’m sure there are many other Christians who are like you and might believe differently."
Christianity,fjyjr1f,t1_fjyj2qd,1583698245.0,"I am interested in other views. I’ve tried to understand Christian Universalism but a lot of the articles and books seem beyond me. Well, also, it feels almost like I’m a heretic for considering it. I grew up in a baptist church until I was 12 and then we tried other churches until my parents stopped going to church. But my foundational views were those of the Baptist beliefs. I get anxiety around hell and even just going to church because I get fearful of hearing wrong teachings in the sermons that I might get led astray....so it’s not easy to start investigating other beliefs on the afterlife but I’m trying to be more open minded."
Christianity,fjydd51,t1_fjybx0c,1583694454.0,I don’t do them to be saved.
Christianity,fjydbho,t1_fjybxp0,1583694429.0,"True. I guess I am just questioning how to reconcile my belief in a loving, merciful God with the existence of hell. Plus scripture is not always clear to me on this. There are certain verses that seem to clearly say people will go to hell and then there are other ones that make me question it. I don’t know the answer and I think it’s ok to be heartbroken over the idea that people will be suffering while I’m in eternal bliss. I can’t imagine that God is happy about having to send the majority of his creation to suffer forever. At least the God I know who cares about the least of these would not be indifferent over it."
Christianity,fjycvux,t1_fjyblen,1583694197.0,"I don’t know. I don’t understand why they don’t want God in their lives. No, he is not obliged to save them but I don’t understand how I will be able to be in heaven while my loved ones are in hell. Maybe he will wash away all memory of them in me - maybe he will forget them himself too. I don’t see a way to watch people suffering for no purpose but to punish forever and not care about it."
Christianity,fjybsvx,t1_fjybga2,1583693626.0,"If God does send the majority of humanity to hell, all I can think is he must wash away all memory of this life. There’s no way I could be happy in heaven knowing my loved ones are suffering forever. Yes I will continue to trust and be as obedient as I can. Thank you."
Christianity,fjybc4r,t1_fjyapbx,1583693381.0,"That’s really hard for me to believe that part of my joy in heaven will be in knowing that my child is suffering forever. In fact, that doesn’t really line up for me with how God is. Does he really find joy in watching his children suffer?"
Christianity,fjyb358,t1_fjyajf3,1583693253.0,"Yes, I do pray for them constantly. I am saved because I trust on Jesus to save me from my sins so I’m not sure what you mean by me not being saved yet. I don’t believe good works get people into heaven."
Christianity,fjy9ptf,t1_fjy9etf,1583692530.0,Ok but even being separated from all that is good is a torment. It is torture. I don’t really see that any different than fire and brimstone. Imagining my loved ones in a place void of all goodness forever and ever does not make me feel any better about it.
Christianity,fjy9hqz,t1_fjy94na,1583692410.0,"Why does God allow people to suffer forever if he loves them? To me, that sounds like he loved them but only until it’s too late and then he gives up on them. Will there be another chance in the end? If someone is in hell and realizes they’ve been wrong (which I can imagine could very well happen) does God just say too late? How in the world could I be happy in heaven knowing people are suffering across the void and will be the rest of eternity?"
Christianity,fjy90vo,t1_fjy8g15,1583692178.0,Dying is a one time thing and we all will die one day. Death is a far cry from endless torment.
Christianity,fjy8oy6,t1_fjy7w9m,1583692011.0,"Yes, it is God’s place to judge but he tells us in the Bible how to be saved. And if someone says they don’t believe they need Jesus to be saved then they are not presently saved, right? So I don’t say someone is saved or not out of a judgmental spirit but out of what the Bible says about salvation. If someone rejects God and Jesus then they cannot be saved. If I’m understanding salvation incorrectly, please help. But if that’s true, then God will be sending my loved ones to hell if they don’t repent before they die. And if that is so, I will be in heaven while my loved ones suffer endlessly."
BipolarReddit,fj8ag9x,t3_fbxjpy,1583108810.0,"How much it costs will depend on your insurance. For me, I only had to pay a small percentage, which ended up being like a few hundred dollars I think....it wasn’t too bad. 

The first time I was hospitalized I was out of my mind and my husband handled all communication with my job and family/friends. I was so out of it I truly don’t know what he told my boss. I imagine he just said I was sick...the second time, I was more in my right mind. I did not tell my job why I was in the hospital. Just that I was sick. I took several weeks off and got on FMLA. When I went back, it was unpleasant but if people knew my business no one said anything. Well, a couple times a coworker came up to me looking really worried and asked me if I was ok. One said I looked really sad /: so yeah.

I won’t lie it was really hard for me. The first time I was in was probably a necessity because I was psychotic. The second time I took myself to the hospital because of my depression and anxiety. I don’t think staying helped me AT ALL the second time and I should’ve done IOP instead. But I wasn’t truly suicidal. I was afraid of possibly being suicidal. It was anxiety related (I suspect OCD). It sounds like in your situation you have started planning and that warrants a trip somewhere to get help so you don’t hurt yourself. 

There were very good and some bad things about my hospital stays. The IOP was really good for me after my first stay and I recommend it."

BipolarReddit,fiz1b8t,t3_faikqf,1582851785.0,"Here’s my experience:

Me: I want to start tapering off this medication soon

Pdoc: let’s not rock the boat

Me: but the medication never worked. I was severely depressed for a year while I was taking it and I just kept taking it because I was afraid of going off it. I mean I had no support to get off it and I was trying to be compliant.

Pdoc: well you’re doing better now, right?

Me: yes, but I really don’t think it’s from the medication. I did a lot of other self-care to get to this point and time seems to have really helped me. I don’t want to take a $1500/mo med for the rest of my life. God forbid I lose my insurance! And what about the long-term side effects??

Pdoc: .........well, let’s not rock the boat. See you in three months (*pushes me out the door with a script*)"
