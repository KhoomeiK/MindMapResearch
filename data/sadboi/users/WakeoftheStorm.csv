Now a caveat to this, the first thing you do is get your damn pet some toys. They need something to do and play with and explore.

I'm honestly not sure how much that influences my taste in books, but it's possible. The scenario of finding out something new about a character can be jarring sometimes. If I've built a specific image in my mind and something major comes in to change it I will definitely be pulled out of the story. 

A good example of this is a character in the ""Dresden Files"" named Morgan. For whatever reason I always pictured him sort of like [Erik King](https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_auto,h_1248,w_2220/f_auto,q_auto,w_1100/v1555297398/shape/mentalfloss/erik_king.jpg). In a later book he was described in a way that was incompatible with a black man and it completely derailed me. After consideration I decided I liked my version better so I just mentally change inconsistencies in the books when they come up.

Another kind of interesting fact is it can really influence my ability to watch TV or movie adaptations of books. Tom Cruise in ""An Interview With a Vampire"" practically ruined the movie for me for example.

Complacency is the enemy of safety. Additionally employees are encouraged, even applauded, for calling a stop due to a safety concern. We once shut down operations for a full day because a new engineer had a concern that a valve wasn't rated for the material that was passing through it. All connected operations immediately stopped until requirements drawings could be reviewed and the original valve manufacturer was contacted to confirm specifications.

The company had 1400 employees basically twiddling their thumbs (with voluntary time off and a lot of housekeeping done) and in the end it turns out the valve was fine.

But it *is* absorbed by the skin. And then while the free protons from the H+ give you a mild acid burn, the F- ions start leaching calcium from your body. Your bones are quickly dissolved under the skin and your flesh turns grey as calcium fluoride deposits build up. That's when the exposed area starts to swell and the pain starts. The pain is good though, because when it stops it means the calcium depletion has begun to interfere with nerve transmission and muscle contraction.

If there's a dramatic pause in the text I pause in my mind while reading it. If someone is speaking slowly and thoughtfully I slow down for that delivery.

menwritingwomen,fqtid4w,t3_gks6y4,1589639593.0,"Not quite the same thing. I *have* frequently read descriptions going on and on about how a guys ""chest muscles ripple beneath his shirt"".

Don't compare written descriptions of secondary sex characteristics to those of actual genitalia."
menwritingwomen,fqti67u,t1_fqt5ni4,1589639484.0,"For some reason it seems fine if it's pluralized. ""The boys in maintenance are working on X"" is a phrase I actually hear a lot."

>And at the latter end of their kingdom, when the transgressors have reached their limit, a king of bold face, one who understands riddles, shall arise. His power shall be great—but not by his own power; and he shall cause fearful destruction and shall succeed in what he does, and destroy mighty men and the people who are the saints. By his cunning he shall make deceit prosper under his hand, and in his own mind he shall become great. Without warning he shall destroy many. 

Obama could be described as a mighty man and Trump definitely wants to destroy him.

Oh and this is a description of the coming of the Antichrist."
