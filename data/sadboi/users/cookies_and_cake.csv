mentalillness,fqifzx4,t1_fqia5zy,1589395493.0,what you are going through is so tough . you are so brave and I hope you can take small steps towards getting better without feeling too pressured and ik I am just all the things that most people would have said but I really do hope your life becomes easier to live. For me today was day one of getting out of this behaviour and eating a little more than what I usually eat . lets not blame ourselves for everything that happens and try to get better.

therapy,fqh8ofo,t1_fqg6bla,1589371166.0, i just realized that my all speculations about myself are true. I do indeed have an eating disorder and it has taken up all my life . I had a  mental breakdown before sleeping just because I found out something about my diet that can lead to weight gain . It made me cry because thats what i have been usually eating. after finding out about that new piece of information I felt like i cant eat anything anymore. its so stupid and complicated i cant even put it into words.

AskReddit,fpw09y1,t3_gfsi0q,1588955008.0,"Not my story but my friend/neighbour's family has experienced some weird things in the house they live in. they have seen blood traces on the stairs, torn up clothes, heard voices and have lost valuables such as jewellary and money. One of the sister has heard a person call her name again and again in one of the rooms on the top floors. There are no signs of someone breaking in or living in their house secretly. There are no places in the house where a full grown man can possibly hide. I live right beside them. Our houses share a wall . I am on the rooftop walking its night time here and now I am a little creeped out."
