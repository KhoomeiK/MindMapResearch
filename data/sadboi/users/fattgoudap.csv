theravada,fhvra1p,t3_f4zlzg,1581900443.0,"Of course meditation has side effects. It leads us down the path of enlightenment.  It didn't take me long to start feeling more different than I ever recalled. But this is uncommon. Meditation is a refuge in daily life and you may be uncovering feelings that have been hidden from your minds view.

I would recommend digging in a little and doing more practice on these bizarre feelings. Trying to discern the truth in them. I wouldn't recommend seeing a psychiatrist because you feel nervous energy about yourself. They will definitely give you drugs. And it won't be beneficial long term. Any atypical feeling or perception is cause for alarm and medication in a psychiatrists eyes unless they are unorthodox, the rarest. 

Maybe see a therapist without medication management. Just for talk therapy.  It can be useful.  But the drugs damage the brain in ways we don't really understand yet. And often manufacture a false reality. Which I'm assuming you'd like to avoid.  Clarity comes in waves, gradual waves but you have to realize you're confused first.
At least I did.
Don't lose your concentration, read more about the Buddha. And pursue the path to liberation."

I sometimes feel like the life of someone with a diagnosis is a bit like a roller coaster trying all these meds and side effects.  I hate the emotional void I get from invega but I also get the personal space issues aswell.  I nearly had an event like yours when I saw someone I recognized an the store and they dismissed me.  Right now I'm working on staying mindful of my mood and thoughts. Hopefully I can make strides and overcome my nervous behavior as I come off invega. Best wishes!"
schizoaffective,etsyc1x,t3_cdbeql,1563158983.0,These are the kind of pointers I could have used when I was first googling symptoms. Instead I just grew so fearful of a disorder only to have it become a self fulfilling prophecy.  Nowadays I cope much better but it didn't always come so easily and I often worry about appearing flat or dull like my personality has been coopted my a doormat.  I know there's a lively person inside me but sometimes the weight of the junk keeps me dormant or the relationships that I used to stimulate me in the past are completely dead and I need to start over post diagnosis.  Anyone relate?

SchizoVerse,etcuawx,t3_bq3h2p,1562692788.0,"I accept that there are abnormal thoughts and concepts floating around in my head, that is clear.  When I started randomly visualizing things during meditation I'd never seen before I was impressed.  But when I decided to make choices to throw out belongings simply because they bothered me, I never felt that was delusional.  There's a difference between that and feeling like an integral part of celestial consciousness.  

It's also not even that I'm half in half out. I believe I am different but I feel the medication is dangerous and ill suited for me.  I'd rather be off and cope on my own with supplementation and nutrition.  But I do have an easier time communicating when my mood is easier for others to process.  

I want the freedom to wander in my conscious experience and believe I may in fact be going in the wrong direction."

I'm diagnosed schizoaffective disorder and I get a monthly injection of invega sustena at the max dose.  

My second hearing is on July 24th and my current doctor seems to hear me when I speak but I have no idea how she will handle court.

I've been going to the library and reading more again.  Color adult coloring books and walking from time to time.  Used to work out a lot but I started isolating and didn't feel welcome at my gym, which was probably just me but it could definitely be intimidating.  

I've been keto since July 2017 but the medication has  me at a higher weight than I'd like to be as well.

Maybe I'll look into Dr breggin"

Psychosis,escw1dv,t1_escv93q,1561840417.0,"Well my parents decided to call a service to take me in to the hospital.  I wasn't talking to them like normal and they wanted to get me help.  I would say I'd been slowly disassociating from my friends and family and I'd made a mess of my apartment, but I'd also been actively meditating for long periods and felt very deep contentment.  Regardless I'm back on medication. 
I've heard that an episode can take up to 5 years to recover from in some cases. This was not one of those situations.  I was diagnosed on my first episode. But I gave them a very detailed description of a vision I'd experienced and it involved a group of spirits that both loved and persecuted me.  So I think I hit all the right Mark's for this diagnosis right off the bat.  
However it triggered in me a fascination with spiritual understanding and my own self importance.  Each person has their own path and we may experience things we weren't prepared for but for you, I cant say there's a guarantee that anything good or bad will come of it. You may never experience anything like it again or it may become chronic."

Apparently I have.  I have had moments where I feel like I can barely speak or articulate a thought properly without confusing other people.  My ideas just become disorganized.  Or I shut down emotionally but as I've gotten  a bit older it's easier to navigate the confusing territory. 

 I've really doubled down on mindfulness Meditation and its helped me make sense of the truth in my mind and body, clearing up excessive thoughts or fearful perceptions as of today"

 This is my first comment here and a new account.  In March I deleted all my accounts and threw out a bunch of stuff. Some stuff I needed some stuff was collecting dust.  Had been off meds but in April got placed on the old faithful.  This weekend was great overall but my parents almost sent me home when I was combative about needing to take medication.  I'm more communicative on the medication this time around and in a better place mentally but I can't help but feel I was trapped into taking the medication again and there's always a feeling of doubt about my possible future and health.  I'm not suffering but it introduces different hurdles being on medication and I struggle with the life long prescription the doctors and my family agree upon.  I just ordered some cbd oil from Lazarusnaturals.com and am hoping this restlessness will settle and I can stop pacing around my apartment.
Hope and pray you are all found well."
Antipsychiatry,er5j7dk,t3_bwlj8c,1560527139.0,"So I have some things to say.  I was recently put back on antipsychotic medicine.  the reason was a court order.  Not real court where I could with a genuine defense stand up for my rights. It was a court where I simply arrive and the doctor describes an inconvenience about my current treatment, incontinence and the mess left by my lack of desire to cooperate as well as my immobility from weakness and general fatigue from having no proper food to eat. 

 While in the hospital, having been removed from my apartment by police after a crisis intervention call, (I was sitting on my couch and not responding to family's uninvited presence) I was taken off my diet as a patient, which I chose specifically to reduce mental health symptoms for the past 2 years.  It tended to be true that I was happier healthier and stronger on the keto diet and had tweaked it to my liking.  But a woman with a flashlight shined it in my eyes and now I'm fit for mental health court...

When I was inpatient I was prescribed invega without a doctor even speaking to me.  I had been pacing around the desk a lot feeling like it was good exercise. I guess the doctor felt otherwise, clearly psychotic.  I had been off the invega injection for 11 months and been doing very arguably well, although I had incontinence, a recurring problem with no real solution in the doctors eyes other than psych meds.  I'm fairly sure these instances are not a flooding of dopamine.  I haven't found a real solution and thinking a psychiatrist could help me in a way that isnt bearing shame and pushing the agenda or laughing in my face about the issue is laughable itself.  But I have no choice it seems.  I was however able to reconnect with my family and they are very supportive while I struggle to adapt to medicines I'd rather avoid.  They approve of my more social attitude, but its easy when I've been describing symptoms for the last 6 years and we both finally feel win-win about the relationship.  This is mostly my openness to them and the constant stream of tasks I can simply decide to take part in as spring transitions to summer.  The idea that I wouldn't have done so if I hadnt been forced to through medicine is their belief.  And I was, I fought and fought but the order had them holding me down and injecting me with older medicine that I didnt feel was the lesser evil.  So I upgraded to the medicine they had been throwing at me invega.  I actually have another injection today.. if I even post this now.  I feel like I've failed myself in that I allowed myself to be caught in the trap again, but I was very angry and had a lot to think about while I was immobile.  

Doctors ended up trying to say I was catatonic and needed the meds to stop it.. this is false.  I was not getting any fat or salt in my diet and my muscles were being eaten to keep me up.  I dropped 20 pounds in the worst way.  until my parents brought food for me, court allowed, their only sense of justice was to stop my horrendously painful colitis.   So essentially I'm fine until I'm starved out and to be clear I'm no stranger to fasting, Ive done 8 days before, but I was in no place to do it with my body mass, lack of salt etc.  I was naturally conserving my energy to not die in their shithole.

This side of the story is always mine to hold.  However deeply painful the struggle is to stay true to myself and the clarity in the divide between how happy I was and how numb I'm becoming on the new trial medicine.  While there is never an off or escape and the only outlook is the permanence of the prescription I'm being given.  

&#x200B;

These medicines they gave me have drastically impacted my ability to be mindful.. I had been meditating a lot daily for longer periods and now I'm distracted and disconnected from that continuity.  I would do something about it but I feel no option.  Nothing is certain other than the familial support i'm getting which will fade as I continue with or without medicine I'm afraid.  The lowest feeling is to know your value is only recognized when you're medicated.  I saw no love until they knew of the needle.  

&#x200B;

TLDR;

I now get monthly injections after 2 months of coercion and threats of electroshock treatment.

My family loves it and I cant meditate anymore, praise the lord. Think of the testimony.

My sense of humor is back with vengeance but I outgrew it in the last year, until stress and social withdraw awoke old problems.

&#x200B;

ps.

Is this the place for this type of comment? I'm looking through related subs."
