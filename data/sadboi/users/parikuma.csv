depression,fqx72l1,t3_gl1vmv,1589727235.0,"Reddit's system is also pretty crappy for places like mental health subreddits. The karma popularity contest stuff is counter-productive to be able to help out without being drowned in posts that can be overwhelming for someone wanting to help.  
I try to offer some insight when I think I have something that might be useful to share (which is far from being all the time), and when reddit itself doesn't make me too jaded (which is not far from being all the time, when looking at ""usual"" subreddits).  
As other people already mentioned, there are a lot of more people in need of help than people able to help, and that's very frustrating indeed. But it's not useless to post.  
I would argue that even if nobody replies it's still good to get it out. And if people reply, then you get some feedback. Most of the time I've seen pretty compassionate people here, but I don't doubt there are also crappy people around unfortunately.  

The one thing I'd like to tell you, as someone who tries to actively contribute when I have something to offer, is that you are absolutely not a burden. If someone replies to your post, it's because they want to. You're not holding a gun to their head telling them to write you something, and they could go and do a billion other things. They want to reply for their own reasons, and you've got to respect that.

Other people have mentioned resilience and it is a thing. You can't really know what's going to be a trauma and what isn't, it depends on too many things for anyone to know for sure. Sometimes it's very ""small"" things, sometimes very ""big"" ones, sometimes nothing happens and then it does, and sometimes you're just okay with little to no lasting impact. Or anything in between.  

Don't worry too much about whether you ""should"" have trauma or not, just use your current stability to understand more things about mental health in general and caring about mental wellbeing in the long run. Spotting the signs of being in distress (like avoidance, isolation, anxiety, unstable emotions, absolutist views, etc), which are great things to know for yourself as well as for your relationships with other people.

The US for reference also has a slightly higher suicide rate for men than Japan (not by much, admittedly).  
Depression is much harder to put numbers to, since there are many ways individuals and countries and mental health structures would measure it (or not) and deal with it (or not). The OECD stats website (and subsequently the wikipedia articles about it) doesn't list Japan, probably because it's not measured and/or reported.  

The reputation that Japan acquired during its technological leaps (80s into the 2000s) can really be dampened nowadays with younger generations, especially as in parallel South Korea flies under the radar and is establishing itself as a pop hub despite being an order of magnitude harsher when it comes to this kind of stuff. I was also surprised to see that Canada is in the top 3 of reported anti-depressant consumption too (and I live in Canada btw).

I'm going to ask you two questions that almost sound accusatory, but they're only emotionally charged inasmuch as I have directly witnessed them and obtained my own answers throughout the years, and have a real interest in hearing from someone who's focusing on the practice themselves.  

1- Why isn't mindfulness explained more often in relatable terms to people ? Instead of getting told ""just focus on your nose and the breath"" with no frame of reference for what one is going towards or trying to feel, there are ways to contextualize what they're aiming for that depends on people's experiences (some people experience a small degree of mindfulness when washing the dishes for example). Bridging the gap between two things can be conceptualized better than making something up with no clear definition.  

2- Why isn't mindfulness more often also contextualized in history, religions, actual examples that are relatable, and so on ?  
Funnily enough, the places where that is done is often manuals for therapists rather than users. While simplifying things might work for some people with the ever-present apps and websites telling you the same two or three things, the constant need to 'dumb down' the practice can also be perceived as a lack of trust in people's abilities to understand the practice for themselves, and in that way it can backfire heavily with anyone who might actually be very serious about trying the practice.

- Redirecting the behaviour to something less harmful, for example a bracelet that is a bit stretchy, to stretch and let it slap back in place. The mild pang of pain can be a substitute for more painful things you seek to do usually  
- Rehearse the fix to the behaviour when you're not in crisis mode, like making the full gesture like you're about to scratch your face (all the way to touching but not scratching) and then removing your hand. Repeat frequently, almost making it a habit to defuse the behaviour on purpose, all the time. It's ok to be compulsive about something not harmful if it defuses the other stuff.

It's absolutely worth underlining that the practice and the exegesis of a religion happens very differently in various parts of the world, I fully agree with you. I just don't see how we should handwave away the idea that Japanese people are overwhelmingly shinto just because they don't **actually** believe there are wolves that speak or that the sun isn't in the same position as the moon because he's angry at it. Hell, by that kind of approach we'd refuse to acknowledge the amount of people who are into buddhism too, as well as the amount of say, christians, that do not believe that everything written in the bible is literally true but only figuratively - as a guide for their lives rather than a dictatorship of words."

I'm saying it's hugely hypocritical to say that Japanese people aren't shinto because they're not thinking that yes-for-sure-there-is-a-god-that-looks-like-a-wolf kind of thing, while saying that the Christians that think things like ""hey maybe the whole apostles and virgin birth thing is a symbol, y'know?"" wouldn't somehow still be Christian.

worldnews,fqftyf0,t1_fqfsjee,1589331636.0,"I think it can be interesting to shift the debate to what constitutes adherence and connection to a religion.  
Here's an example: [the USA seemingly has 240 million christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_the_United_States). What do you make of it when actually looking at what people practice in their day-to-day life?  

I would argue that I have encountered very frequent references to shinto and buddhism from everyone I knew when I lived in Tokyo (I was at The University of Tokyo and directly observed people going to [pray for their exams](https://www.nippon.com/en/jip/p00115/praying-to-pass-students-seek-divine-assistance-for-entrance-exams-japan-in-photos.html) for example), in a way that is fairly reminiscent of references to food habits and church-related events (bells ringing during the day, clear wish to be married at church, etc) from most of the ""non-practicing"" christians I've known in Europe, where I'm from. 

As you mention, the article goes on to argue back and forth about what one considers a religion. There are definitely many customs that do not mean that one necessarily believes in a religion (I'm not christian but I did have christmas as a kid, for example), but when you align the discussion to calibrate what makes one person ""of a religion"" when looking at other religions, there is leeway to accept that most Japanese people do indeed believe in the loose boundaries of shinto, the notions of spirits and the ingrained respect towards them (hell, Studio Ghibli or most of the current output of Japanese culture can attest to that) and so on, which supports the notion that they do hold a connection to religion that goes beyond an image.  

edit: I also forgot to mention that I don't think I understand your point about multiple religions. You seem knowledgeable enough to know that shinto allows and in some ways even encourages having a connection to multiple religions, hence the saying you wrote before. So I'm confused there, what is your point?"

""According to the annual statistical research on religion in 2015 by the Agency for Culture Affairs, Government of Japan, 70.4 percent of the population practices Shintoism, 69.8 percent Buddhism, 1.5 percent Christianity, and 6.9 percent others. Total adherents exceeds 100% because many Japanese people (91.6%) practice both Shintoism and Buddhism.[6][7][8][9][10]""  

The article goes on to explain the following:  

""Most of the Japanese (50% to 80% considering degrees of syncretism with Buddhism, shinbutsu-shūgō[16]) pray and worship ancestors and gods (神, kami, shin or, archaically, jin) at Shinto shrines or at private altars, while not identifying as ""Shinto"" or ""Shintoist"" in surveys.[17] This is because these terms have little meaning for the majority of the Japanese,[17] or because they define membership in Shinto organizations or sects.[18][19]""

depression_help,fq1diw2,t1_fq14e81,1589044671.0,"Trauma-informed care/therapy is definitely something that the mental health community is increasingly focusing on.  

I remember reading this about trauma: most people think of Trauma with a big T, thinking that nothing else counts, and that there's a clear classification for what falls into it. The thing to remember is that it's not so much like there is small and big trauma, and more like there is impactful trauma for the person or less so.  
Not every bad experience leads to a scar that can't heal, and any two people can live through the same event and have vastly different outcomes.  
*Assuming that*, it can be useful to look at our own experiences and lives and try to spot and understand what specific experiences, and what *kinds* of experiences, can affect us most deeply. And for that, there's many things we can assess: ""I overreacted in this situation"", ""I felt very hurt by this but objectively there was no reason for that to be the case, I am more sensitive to this specific thing"", etc. There's no way you can catch everything all the time, but by doing the mental workout frequently you can get better at that, and in turn help yourself face future situations.  

There's quite a bit that is still considered pretty fringe ""pseudo-science"" in the work around trauma (not the medical research, just the amount of therapies developed since the 70s), so it's important to approach any model with a skeptical mind and just analyze it and work it out for ourselves as food for thought. It's probably more important to look at the essence of what it's trying to convey: putting a name on things can help us approach and improve our life."

However while there are many shapes for the ""think-feel-do"" diagram, and there's ways to refine and criticize any of those models, there is also some value in observing the cycle as it goes on and on constantly, and learning to influence the parts we are most likely to have control over: primarily the beliefs we hold and the actions we take as a result of our emotions.  
I don't know if you'd have any interest in that, but I've personally found some usefulness in books that approach things like DBT *from the therapist's standpoint*, as that can offer more categories of examples and logical pathways for various cases. It's like the multifaceted approach to those techniques then becomes much more useful to synthesize what it's all about, instead of putting the focus on the *appearances* (the physical stuff, like what goes on during sessions, and the worksheets and so on). A good example of this is this [practical guide to DBT](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13202457-doing-dialectical-behavior-therapy).

It doesn't help that french, italian and european names [are a mess to untangle](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/51263/what-are-flour-types-t45-t55-t65-t150-type-0-or-type-00-magic-enzy-flour-rye-flour-t1150).  

I've tried to look for stuff in English that correlates with what I've come to know in French, and I guess [this one](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/classic-baguettes-recipe), and perhaps the video and elements in [that one](https://breadtopia.com/how-to-make-baguettes/) could be of use.  

Honestly you knocked it out of the park as for the prep and end result appearance, so I'm not too worried that you can make anything you want and are ahead of most french people by a big margin there.  
Another thing to keep in mind is that wheat flour is really like ""the baguette you get at the boulangerie"", and with that comes the short shelf-life: it doesn't last as long, and is most worthy of being eaten the day of, with some next-day use too ([pain perdu](https://www.marmiton.org/recettes/recette_pain-perdu-facile-a-ma-facon_40479.aspx), aka french toast, or with a little revival using [the water trick](https://food-hacks.wonderhowto.com/how-to/revive-stale-baguette-using-miraculous-water-trick-0161237/) - with or without the tinfoil)  

FWIW, in my opinion the taste difference is heavily noticeable if you make a typical jambon-beurre (ham-butter) type of sandwich, or use the bread with charcuterie and cheeses (a good ol' board.. I'd have lots to say about being able to find real 'saucisson sec' in North America too - it's HARD to find!).

Keeps well, but is significantly more sour. It's the norm in North America probably because people can't buy it fresh every day, but anyone tricked into getting a sourdough when expecting a French baguette can attest to the painful difference in taste.

The important part is that you hold on to the feeling this gives you, you keep in mind that this is something that can and will happen again and better, and that this will come out of a combination of your willpower, medical support, and therapeutic healing. Some days will not be like this one, they'll be like the depression you've come to know, and that's OK. Comparison is the thief of joy, accepting things as they come really helps in the long run. There's other days to get back on the horse.  
  
The main thing I wish could be shown to everyone deep in the pit of their despair, is a day like the one you're having. Just to remind them what it's like. To remember that things can be good, that no you're not useless or broken or anything like that. To acknowledge that the path is arduous and treacherous but really isn't a lost cause. And just how much awesomeness there is right underneath the shell of depression one can get stuck in. How a 'normal' day can be like finding water when you've been crossing the seemingly endless aridity of depression.  

It's going to be OK. If this treatment plateaus or has downsides that are too hard to handle, you can talk with your psychiatrist and try something else. When you have good days, you can try to connect what you learn in therapy when depressed with how you see the same thing when the veil is lifted a bit. Use that as a lifeline on days where things get tougher.  
And now you've got a reminder of what you'd like to feel like at least, and that can guide your progress.

I find that if you truly accept the impermanence of your current state, you can feel a sort of weight lifted from you and then leverage that energy towards gradually getting out of the pit. It doesn't mean your depression will disappear magically, but simply that the current pit you're in cannot be a pit if you're not bound to get out of it. And if you're not bound to get out of it, you'll be level long enough to deal with it because we're constantly learning to get by (the related example with a ""high"" level rather than a low one is the [hedonic treadmill](https://positivepsychology.com/hedonic-treadmill/))  

If you've had any experience with psychedelics also, that thought process can help overcome any uncomfortable process or what otherwise could be a bad trip. Accepting change doesn't mean giving up, it only means that you'll find the most appropriate way out.

The flow of water or the lightning during a storm are arguably not weak things, yet they do the same thing: why try to go against resistance when you can find your way through by branching out and making some steps.  
If you're lightning, and you want to reach the ground, you make small tries in different directions and sometimes backtrack and try again where you go a bit further, and so on and so forth. Getting through the depression is like trying to unload that energy and putting steps forward and sideways and so on, until you find the way out."
printSF,fp9jr6j,t3_gc5hhz,1588427960.0,"I find this part pretty interesting  

>Jemisin decided to rewrite The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms, making nearly the entire cast white. “All of them were horrible people. They’d shank each other for, like, nothing. And I wrote this angry story about this lone brown girl going into this place full of mean white people,” she says. It went to auction, with three different publishers fighting over it. “And I’m like, this is what you want?” she says. “I was pretty bitter … I’d taken such care in [The Killing Moon] to include sympathetic white people, but that wasn’t what they wanted.”

I think the people who tend to be SF readers wish in general to have a more critical mind and to think about the big picture more than in a lot of other genres, and we can see that it shows differently here: wanting equal recognition and a sense of normalcy when being black, and wanting to seek the extremes of the character when white.  

I think this is probably because anyone who's white has lived comfortably with white characters their whole life, and they can pick from any work of fiction to find all the usual tropes that define a sort of normalcy, so in a way it's kind of boring for them. The ""fun"" thus lies within the confines of tortured, fringe, eccentric white characters.  
When you're black, you've spent your life living among depictions of white as the norm for what amounts to a few thousand years now - as the Romans anchored in the western world tales of the Greeks over any other preceding lore (who knows much about the Epic of Gilgamesh except for the name?). You also want to see complex/messed up/intense characters but if there's only one black person and they're like that, then you're more likely to be left with a bitter taste. It can't feel the same having a character who's ""different"" when all the characters who have your skin colour have been defaulted to being different in the first place. 
Feeling comfortable playing around the misty lines of societal normalcy is a privilege that white people don't realize they have.  
Even with changes occurring in visual media these days, I can't think of a lot of work that isn't either keeping the main/central characters white OR making a big deal out of someone being black. 

We have to remember that you don't undo thousands of years in a couple decades, and it's going to take a whole lot more time for the ""normal"" we want to be the ""normal"" we should be having."

Ayant vécu ""dans"" le RER B pendant des années, je suis loin d'être surpris par la plupart des graphiques. J'ai grandi dans les zones rouges, passé des heures à me battre pour avoir un train à Gare du Nord, à attendre des trains en fin de ligne au sud qui finissent par être annulés (ah, Le Guichet et Arcueil-Cachan..), des heures à attendre la fermeture des portes aux stations les plus remplies, entassé comme une sardine, des centaines de voyages via Orly et Roissy, et des études liées à 3 grandes écoles et une université toutes sur la ligne B (plus ou moins..) .  
Le désordre dans le sud semble enfin s'améliorer avec le regroupement des écoles et le développement d'un réseau plus urbain pour Paris-Saclay. L'abandon politique et sociétal des zones du nord oscille beaucoup trop encore même si les choses s'améliorent enfin (avec 30 à 40 ans de retard..).  

C'est vraiment une ligne compliquée à gérer car les problèmes sont différents dans chaque portion de la ligne.
 

Au nord de Paris c'est d'abord universités, bureaux, banlieues, les inégalités, l'accès aux stations, les problèmes de délits et propreté.  
En fin de ligne au nord c'est beaucoup plus logistique et lié au tourisme (CDG et sa station horrible en sortie d'aéroport, Le Bourget, les visiteurs en direction de Paris - ou parfois directement Disneyland..).  
Dans Paris c'est le flux tendu, un moyen rapide de couper Paris du Nord au Sud, et beaucoup de délits similaires à ce que la RATP doit subir.  
Juste à la sortie de Paris ça redevient un mix de banlieue, universités, mais ça devient plus riche (il ne faut pas passer longtemps à Antony et Bourg-la-Reine pour s'apercevoir qu'on est loin de ce qui se fait au nord de Paris).  
Puis il y a Orly, qui à mon sens reste vraiment bizarre avec l'OrlyVal qui coûte davantage, force un changement curieux, et souvent s'avère beaucoup plus lent que la navette en bus partant de Denfert.  
Quelques stations souvent très vides par la suite, et la gigantesque station de Massy-Palaiseau (améliorée substantiellement en 10 ans mais toujours prône à faire faire du sport à celles et ceux qui souhaitent changer de ligne sans manquer le train ou le bus qu'ils voient dans la distance)  
Et enfin, le groupement du sud.. qui est un espèce de détour champêtre laissant à une quantité astronomique d'étudiants/de professeurs/de chercheurs la chance de prendre un peu d'air frais avant d'avoir à courir pour attraper le bus en direction de leurs campus respectifs (ou dans le cas de Paris XI en hivers, une bonne dose de snowboarding en pente à 15% pour bien réveiller le matin).

For the meds, I think you need to immediately get back on your prescription. If it's about picking it up, you call them and pick it up today. If you need a new one, contact your psychiatrist so that they get you back on a prescription. I mean it, not in two days or six days or whatever, today. Voicemail, text, email, whatever. You explain your situation to the doctor and get it sorted out.

For the routine, a lot of people even without depression have been going through this with the quarantine. Finding a rhythm to things can be tricky, but if you want suggestions there I think the biggest impact is to have a military-like routine (without the military, thankfully!) at least to start the day. No exceptions and whys and such.  

You wake up every day at the same time. Set your alarm now, recurring, and repeating every few minutes indefinitely if you snooze. Don't think about it more than to decide which hour (8? 9? say 9!).  **You just do.**

Just another thing: it might feel like you're scraping at the bottom of things in your life when you're in places like the locked area of an ER backroom, with or without phone and clothes and such.  
There's a lot of stuff that's still a bit medieval about how we humans handle the immense complexity of our brains and thoughts. Anyone who hasn't been there can't fully grasp the kind of patience it takes to get by. So honestly I congratulate you because you're here, and here to share about it, and even though places like that might not be an immediate healing ground, they're more like blocking an open wound to prevent it from bleeding more. The next step isn't to walk out of that and fall into the trap of whoever told you that ""normal"" is a thing. The next step is to try to reach out (find the surgeons - psychiatrist/psychologist - and the bedside nurses - loved ones -, of your life) in a way that allows you to patch things up (start treatments and therapy), cope and heal (adjust your treatment ongoing, and apply the tools you learn in therapy). We humans seem to understand all of this so well when someone has an open fracture or a cancer, but somehow a lot of us forget that the long road is as arduous (if not more) for mental health.  

I'm not going to bullshit you, it can be a roller coaster with treatments and all the things that happen in the mind during therapy. Remember the pain when limbs were growing, teeth were appearing? Or the countless times learning things in school that were utterly frustrating or headache-inducing? The growing pains of advancing are real. And while I might not care about every single painful lesson I had in class (switching meds or having to find a therapist that was more in tune with me), I'm glad I got some education (therapy) and I'm way happier having teeth than without (meds for specific disorders).

mentalhealth,fnsmwya,t3_g3m10i,1587224870.0,"There's no such thing as ""normal"". You are not inferior, no matter what some people in life might say or do, no matter what it makes you feel.  
In these situations, my understanding is that you are let out if you can convince them that you have a sense of self, some ""average"" understanding of your situation (why you got there, who you are, etc) and of the people and society around you (what year this is, that you're not seeing/hearing things that only you can see/hear, etc), and that you're not at risk of hurting yourself or others (it's more about the planning than the time it might take, if you know you'll kill yourself in 6 months it's still a real risk for example) and that you're on a plan to seek help. All that, provided the people keeping you there have enough abilities to focus their attention towards you. They might be swamped/exhausted, and miss out on some things here and there.  

There are many ways one can fake some of these things and there can be a lot of variability depending on the place you end up at, but for what goal if it changes nothing about what led you there? It's a good thing that we can be in a society where we acknowledge that people can face hurdles with what's arguably the most complex thing we know of (brains and bodies). 
If you are there under the mental health act I'd recommend you try to make the best out of it and secure opportunities to see psychiatrists and psychologists, to contact (or get people to contact) some people who love you so that they can support you. The path towards feeling better might be a convoluted mess, so might as well team up with people who know how to work on it and people who know and cherish who you are.  
(For anyone thinking that there's nobody like that for them: it's way more likely that our issues prevent us from seeing them, than them not existing at all)  

As for anyone telling you anything about ""normalcy"", or things that lead you to feel inferior: work actively to let it pass by you. I can tell you that you're a giant rainbow zebra and you can fully disregard my statement without feeling like an animal or ""abnormal"". You're you, and

Maybe for things like crosstalk issues you can bring to the table some EM knowledge, but otherwise as you said you leave it to the people designing the hardware.   
What you (primarily) like is communication between machines, not how they work. A linguist and a neuroscientist don't have the same interests, even if some concepts overlap."

mentalhealth,fnidgyj,t1_fnhjtke,1586978140.0,"This is really accurate.  
CBT doesn't ask you to lie to yourself.  
It makes the hypothesis that there is a cycle constantly happening between what we do and experience and that within ourselves we tend to process things so fast that we don't really give enough focus to what really happens in that cycle, namely the thoughts and feelings we have before we act.  

When therapists talk about challenging negative thoughts it does feel sometimes like they're just saying to disregard thoughts you have. But what they really mean is that you might feel certain things based on beliefs or thoughts that are incorrect (not all your thoughts are, but some are - for everyone), and that you need to exercise the ""muscles"" in your brain to learn to observe the thoughts you have and the actions it makes you do.  
And if you manage to do that, then you can push further to understand what feelings you have that are connected to those thoughts and actions.  
When you start to observe your feelings and your thoughts, you can then take some time to challenge the thoughts that can be rebuked. Very often with depressive disorders it's going to involve some form of absolutism (""things are always going to be this way"", or ""I am a bad person and that's a fact"") and some undeserved self-hatred (""I don't deserve to be happy"" - let's admit that, but then ""I don't deserve to be unhappy"" is just as valid isn't it ? No ? How come? -> observe why you would think no, etc.)  

Funny thing is, our beliefs and thoughts without a steady foundation are usually fairly easy to see from the outside of ourselves. Someone with an acute sense of people, or with a professional training (.. a therapist?) will see them more easily than we'll admit them to ourselves.  
So as /u/amberknightot said, it's not about lying to yourself. It's actually about NOT lying to yourself anymore, and defusing the thoughts and beliefs anchored within you.. that might have something to do with keeping you in this state.


--- 

And for /u/amberknightot :  
DBT is a subset of CBT created for people with BPD but has also become useful to various kinds of people with traumas, self-harm, suicidal ideation. It tends to occur in sessions with a therapist who helps patients accept that their emotions are real, provides a sense of validation, and help focus mindfulness-based techniques towards dealing with those emotions and the consequential cycles of ""thought -> emotion -> action"". So in practice for most of us here, there isn't a big difference. Probably better left to debate between researchers and therapists who know better (and I am not one of them, btw)."

Thanks for sharing!"
mentalhealth,fnbz9g5,t3_g0rabm,1586825315.0,"Your ""best"" you is the result of an optimization problem solved for a specific definition of ""best"". Not only is it not about being ""the best"", it is also not about being anyone else's definition of ""best"". And there's no such thing as being ""the best"" in a general manner.  
Every person will have a definition of it that can differ, and also evolve over time for any given person. Figuring out which parameters to try improving for ourselves is the key element for the optimization problem.  

What is the ""best"" bridge ?  
Is it one that, with nobody on it, can withstand the strongest winds ? Is it one that, with no wind, can withstand the most people ? Is it the highest, the longest ? The heaviest ? The one outlasting every other bridge ? And what about parameters that contradict each other, such as being the longest (covers most distance) and the shortest (can be used the fastest) bridge ? 
From a practical point of view, there are more possible choices of parameters than we can come up with. There are also parameters that, for two given versions of ""best"", would lead to the opposite results.  
If ""being in the best shape"" clashes with ""feeling fulfilled/happy"", then perhaps reformulate it into ""being in the best possible shape that ensures I still remain happy"". Keeping in mind that ""happy"" and your ""shape"" might depend on each other in ways that aren't linear or easy-to-grasp until you just try to play with the variables. 
If ""being well-paid"" clashes with ""having healthy relationships"", maybe analyze how you define 'well-paid' and 'healthy' and where you could find the middle ground to go towards. And so on.  


Feeling upset about compromising and this ""walk in the dark"" approach implies that one is still holding on to the paradoxical definition of ""best"" as ""maximizes every possible parameter"". Learn to understand which things you are trying to optimize and why, and accept that the choices can also evolve (letting go of some things and picking up new ones).  
Most things depend on combinations of other things, and there's no single person who comprehends all of life, therefore we ""do stuff"", then ""observe results"", and ""correct the course"" constantly."
mentalhealth,fnamhzk,t3_g0gv66,1586800055.0,"You're going through a particularly sinister version of personal hell, because it feels very lonely in there and the things you were a victim of continue to make you a victim of yourself. I think you've done some good work if you already know that you have POCD, as that should reinforce the notion that this is a form of OCD you need help with. [Here's little article about POCD](https://www.treatmyocd.com/blog/pedophilia-ocd/) to help you feel a bit less alone. And [here is another link](https://iocdf.org/expert-opinions/am-i-a-monster-an-overview-of-common-features-typical-course-shame-and-treatment-of-pedophilia-ocd-pocd/) showing you that POCD and paedophilia have only in common the first letter, and your current thinking (the intrusive thoughts, as well as the absolute thinking about being evil and broken) is the result of what you experienced.  

You have a strong resolve to end the cycle of abuse and pain, and that's fantastic to hear. Seriously, you can draw a lot of strength from those thoughts (as you have done already).  
However, you need to know that this can't end with you hoping to suppress this without addressing the difficulty with real support, and that means therapist/sexologist help. It can be incredibly daunting to consider sharing what you're writing here with anyone, because of the fear that they will assess you as being a risk to others or self and therefore get you ""sent away"". It is not unreasonable to think that way because society stigmatizes even the mere mention of the terms, let alone actual discussions about the disorders associated with it (which I'd argue is the source of untold damages in society by shutting down people in pain searching for help, thus creating the exact ""monsters"" people wish to see - a self-fulfilling prophecy of pain). But there's a pretty noticeable difference between intrusive thoughts and your sexuality. Also worth noting that there's a noticeable difference between paedophilia and child molestation (one is a sexual inclination that one can manage to never act upon, the other is a criminal act that in many cases is actually not even related to paedophilia).
You mention being into ddlg, which is in no way illegal or hurting a person who can't give consent in and of itself. Sexuality is in many ways tied to early experiences or intense ones, and there's no issue with wanting to take back control by practicing it with consent between adults. Rape survivors who develop rape fantasies come to mind: having that sexual fantasy playing out with a trusted partner in a roleplay situation is not an issue, and can be cathartic (because one gets to *take back control* of something they were forced into).  

So in your situation I'd either go with the one I trust the most, or keep looking for other professionals with whom the trust relationship can be strengthened intuitively before opening up. Maybe there are programs in your city or area that offer help with this, and if you are feeling scared and worried to search for those terms on your computer then you could use the [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) and search for those centres via [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) (the default browser on tor). By the way, there's nothing illegal with searching for those centres and for help, but depending on where you live it could be illegal to access lolicon in the first place. I'm not saying that to freak you out, just to put things in context. There are places and programs for people with sexual disorders, too often only sought by convicted sex offenders or people incarcerated following other self-destructive acts, once the veil of taboo is lifted.  
   
If you could establish a trustworthy connection with one of the professionals you would see one-on-one, then you could either open up slowly (say, sharing about the abuse and the kink it led to, excluding at first the POCD) and ""ramp up"" when you feel comfortable, or go straight to the point without forgetting to mention that you are very self aware and not acting on those thoughts (and not planning to). A therapist with whom you would have a serious connection, who is willing to help you, will understand your commitment to healing. Right now your biggest challenge is to accept that you won't be able to do this alone.  

A couple more resources you might want to look into:  
- [A project from Germany allowing anonymous discussions about those kinds of troubles and advice from therapists](https://troubled-desire.com/en/)  
- [B4uAct](https://www.b4uact.org/attracted-to-minors/faq-for-maps/) is aimed at ""minor-attracted persons"" (MAPs) which I'd argue isn't exactly your case (but you still have all the difficulties of MAPs therefore the info can be useful), and they also have [examples of questions to ask a therapist](https://www.b4uact.org/attracted-to-minors/professional-support/) and other resources worth exploring  

---

Lastly, I'd advise you to do a few different things:  
- cementing the separation in your mind of POCD (a form of OCD) from paedophilia (sexuality), from child abuse and all forms of it (crime)  
- learn to take a step back from your emotions especially about yourself, as it leads you to voice things in an absolute manner (""I'm evil"") that is not helpful for your healing and to fulfill what you have a strong resolve for (stopping the cycle of abuse)  
- build your way towards trustworthy external help from people with credentials (a subreddit won't do enough), accepting that therapy is a necessity (and meds could be useful, depending on the assessment from professionals)  
- understanding that certain parts of what you've experienced lead to behaviours that can be OK (legal sexual behaviour with consenting adults), while other parts might be better addressed for your own sake (the repetitive behaviour could be something you work to control by applying tools of CBT for example)  
  
I hope that helps even a tiny bit. You're in a very difficult situation but you're wanting to do good things and you deserve to be happy."

Now that you've discovered Breton, brace for impact: [carte des langues régionales ou minoritaires en France](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langues_r%C3%A9gionales_ou_minoritaires_de_France#/media/Fichier:Langues_de_la_France.svg) (and that's focused on metropolitan France, without the Créole languages, Kanak in Nouvelle-Calédonie, etc)  

The french article on regional languages says the following:  
>Les langues régionales sont mentionnées dans la Constitution française à l'article 75-1 ainsi rédigé : « Les langues régionales appartiennent au patrimoine de la France », ajouté par la loi du 23 juillet 2008.

> La France a signé la charte européenne des langues régionales ou minoritaires, mais a refusé sa ratification. Le 14 janvier 2016, le projet de loi pour l'enseignement immersif des langues régionales est rejeté à l'Assemblée nationale avec 24 députés présents mais 28 votants, 13 votes pour et 14 votes contre. Les 4 votes supplémentaires penchant du côté contre ont fait pencher la balance à l'opposé de la majorité des présents, provoquant ainsi la colère des partisans au projet.  

Which basically means that while some progress occured by 2008 (regional languages being considered part of the French heritage), the country still hasn't ratified the European approach to protection of minority languages ([European Charter for Regional or Minority languages](https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-charter-regional-or-minority-languages)) - ironically signed in fucking Strasbourg. Add to that, immersive learning of regional languages being rejected with a saddening low amount of voters (28) and some fuckery about how it all went down.  
Two things to take away from that vote: low involvement of politicians, and low-key continuous rejection of the protection of those languages. France still has a lot of work to do to accept its misdeeds with grace and move forward with embracing cultures beyond the  ""national identity"" often pushed heavily and weaponized by politicians (Sarkozy comes to mind)."

edit: I can also introduce you to the Lexicon part of the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_language) :  
As a result of 1000 years of Chinese rule, much of the Vietnamese lexicon relating to science and politics is derived from Chinese — see Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary. Some 30% to 60% of the lexical stock has naturalized word borrowings from Chinese, although many compound words are composed of native Vietnamese words combined with naturalized word borrowings (i.e. having Vietnamese pronunciation).  
From the French assistance to Nguyễn Ánh (1777) to the 1954 Geneva Conference (1954), Vietnamese has been influenced by the 177 years of French language in Vietnam, for example cà phê (from French café). Nowadays, many new words are being added to the language's lexicon due to heavy Western cultural influence; these are usually borrowed from English, for example TV (though usually seen in the written form as tivi). Sometimes these borrowings are calques literally translated into Vietnamese (for example, software is calqued into phần mềm, which literally means ""soft part"").

excluded even, save on the days of general disaster when the majority rally round the victim as the Jews rallied round Dreyfus, from the sympathy--at times from the society--of their fellows, in whom they inspire only disgust at seeing themselves as they are, portrayed in a mirror which, ceasing to flatter them, accentuates every blemish that they have refused to observe in themselves, and makes them understand that what they have been calling their love (a thing to which, playing upon the word, they have by association annexed all that poetry, painting, music, chivalry, asceticism have contrived to add to love) springs not from an ideal of beauty which they have chosen but from an incurable malady; like the Jews again (save some who will associate only with others of their race and have always on their lips ritual words and consecrated pleasantries), shunning one another, seeking out those who are most directly their opposite, who do not desire their company, pardoning their rebuffs, moved to ecstasy by their condescension; but also brought into the company of their own kind by the ostracism that strikes them, the opprobrium under which they have fallen, having finally been invested, by a persecution similar to that of Israel, with the physical and moral characteristics of a race, sometimes beautiful, often hideous, finding (in spite of all the mockery with which he who, more closely blended with, better assimilated to the opposing race, is relatively, in appearance, the least inverted, heaps upon him who has remained more so) a relief in frequenting the society of their kind, and even some corroboration of their own life, so much so that, while steadfastly denying that they are a race (the name of which is the vilest of insults), those who succeed in concealing the fact that they belong to it they readily unmask, with a view less to injuring them, though they have no scruple about that, than to excusing themselves; and, going in search (as a doctor seeks cases of appendicitis) of cases of inversion in history, taking pleasure in recalling that Socrates was one of themselves, as the Israelites claim that Jesus was one of them, without reflecting that there were no abnormals when homosexuality was the norm, no anti-Christians before Christ, that the disgrace alone makes the crime because it has allowed to survive only those who remained obdurate to every warning, to every example, to every punishment, by virtue of an innate disposition so peculiar that it is more repugnant to other men (even though it may be accompanied by exalted moral qualities) than certain other vices which exclude those qualities, such as theft, cruelty, breach of faith, vices better understood and so more readily excused by the generality of men;

all of them obliged to protect their own secret but having their part in a secret shared with the others, which the rest of humanity does not suspect and which means that to them the most wildly improbable tales of adventure seem true, for in this romantic, anachronistic life the ambassador is a bosom friend of the felon, the prince, with a certain independence of action with which his aristocratic breeding has furnished him, and which the trembling little cit would lack, on leaving the duchess's party goes off to confer in private with the hooligan; a reprobate part of the human whole, but an important part, suspected where it does not exist, flaunting itself, insolent and unpunished, where its existence is never guessed; numbering its adherents everywhere, among the people, in the army, in the church, in the prison, on the throne; living, in short, at least to a great extent, in a playful and perilous intimacy with the men of the other race, provoking them, playing with them by speaking of its vice as of something alien to it; a game that is rendered easy by the blindness or duplicity of the others, a game that may be kept up for years until the day of the scandal, on which these lion-tamers are devoured; until then, obliged to make a secret of their lives, to turn away their eyes from the things on which they would naturally fasten them, to fasten them upon those from which they would naturally turn away, to change the gender of many of the words in their vocabulary, a social constraint, slight in comparison with the inward constraint which their vice, or what is improperly so called, imposes upon them with regard not so much now to others as to themselves, and in such a way that to themselves it does not appear a vice."""

Japan has three systems at once, and the third one is basically reused originally-Chinese characters with a twist (either they take the character for its meaning, for its sound in Chinese, for a combination of that, or sometimes just to mess with you).  
  

Korean also uses Chinese characters in certain contexts, but thankfully their ""fun"" characters can be used for the most part and are super easy to learn - every subset is actually a sort-of letter/sound, and the whole character is basically a syllable-ish.  
For example:    
ㄱ (K) twice equals ㄲ (KK)  
and ㅜ (U)  
and ㄹ (L)  
and you get 꿀 (KKUL)  
  

And Vietnamese is influenced by the roman alphabet evidently, but the symbols above and under are in big part there to indicate the tone (rising, falling, etc) - which is actually pretty damn smart when you think about it. I would have been happy to know what tone to use when learning English, for example."
