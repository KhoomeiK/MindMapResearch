HPV,fouxqzl,t3_g8rfdo,1588092121.0,"I 100 percent agree. This is huge - women bare the consequences while men are never tested (is USA).  I never learned about HPV before I got it. I've since had CIN3 and LEEP and am having less than idea side effects. I am upset and angry because I was never recommended to get the vaccine and I'll never know who passed it to me. If men were tested and educated we could all be in the together making the most informed decisions about our bodies.

I urge you all - please be vocal about HPV. Dont have shame about it. Tell others - you could help so many who have no idea either. Thats the only way we can get the word out there until there is real change from healthcare or government."

Practically - taking a digestive enzyme supplement helped because my stomach acid was low. 

Unpractically - eat foods I actually liked and felt good after eating. I slept a lot. Got out of my head as much as possible. Listened to more music than ever.  Wrote ALOT in a journal. It takes time. Be patient. The body is so smart we just gotta trust her."

HPV,fjgn10o,t3_fdddy8,1583331002.0,I had LEEP in January but not with anesthesia. The odor is normal - this will last for about a week or two. It is strange but its your body shedding the chemicals used to sterilize the area. I would guess either the pain killers or anesthesia would have you backed up for a bit - just keep drinking water and eating good amounts of fiber! As for the other worries - def call your doctor or the nurse to see what is expected. Good luck with your healing!

But I honestly feel like my relationship with food is the best it‚Äôs been. I have little anxiety around food and numbers. I *almost* feel normal.

I had my ups and downs and full relapses and slight regressions. I was in treatment on and off for 10 years.  

I‚Äôm not saying it will take 15 years to feel this way but it may. Just keep doing the next right thing. Life is very sweet."

The weight can settle a little unnaturally at first (I thought this was a lie back in the day - its not!) but it will change over time. 

Give yourself grace - and trust your body. She knows what she is doing. She knows when to make your heart beat and your lungs breathe. And she will know what to do with the nutrition you are giving her. You are healing and it will take awhile but it gets better. I promise. Maybe not tomorrow but maybe the tomorrow after that.
