It was the first time i was allowed a guy to sleep over, he stayed in my room and i stayed in the livingroom. We texted until around midnight when i knew my mom was asleep and went into my room. I laid down with him. for awhile we whispered in the dark and eventually our foreheads were touching, and we both leaned in for a kiss at the same time. It was our first kiss and everything about it was perfect to me. And for me, i knew i loved him because i never felt THAT comfortable with anyone else, ever.

BPD,fgt2y80,t3_f0as7e,1581097947.0,"This is exactly why im extremely hopeless. I have to rebuild my life for what others have done to me and they can live scotch free every day. Dbt and other therapies to me are literally translations to ""Youll still feel all these feelings, to the same degree, but this is to make the peoples lives around you better so you arent such an unstable psychopath"". Ive tried SO HARD to fit into this stupid system but apparently my only answers are meds therapy and DBT so im screwed. Because im not going to improve myself so the others around me benefit. Any therapist ive asked about dbt, they basically say its JUST for how you cope. Not what you feel in any way, that stays the same. I tried dbt. If i cant even do my school work, and im failing every class, i cant focus on a booklet about how to cope. 

Sorry if this is all over the place and seems rude but im fed up with the mental health system so when i talk about it at all i tend to go overboard. This is just my experience. Therapy, meds, and dbt has worked for people before. But in my case it doesnt. It doesnt change what happened to me in the past and it doesnt change anything emotionally being stuck in a constant chronically stressed situation (which i am and have been for years)"
