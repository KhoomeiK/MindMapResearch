The sauce was pretty simple, although I winged it without measuring much so I'll just give estimates:

1 tbs olive oil

1 small shallot minced

2 cloves garlic minced

zest of three lemons

juice of one large lemon

1/4 cup white wine

1/2 cup chicken stock (preferably a good gelatinous stock, homemade)

A bunch of dill, chopped

black pepper and salt

2 tbs cold butter into chunks

Cook the shallot and garlic on low-medium heat in the oil until soft and fragrant. Add the lemon zest and continue cooking another minute. Add the wine and stock and bring to a simmer until it starts to reduce a bit. Add the lemon juice and continue cooking another 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Now take it off the heat and whisk in your chunks of cold butter. You want to emulsify that butter so it makes a sauce with some body. Toss the sauce with the pasta and the dill and the chicken, finish with a little more pepper. 

The chicken I simply poached in chicken stock that I already had on hand, with some herbs. Then I simply chopped it up and tossed it with the pasta."

400ml lukewarm water

615g unbleached bread flour

18 g salt


Combine everything until a wet, uniform dough forms. I’ll use the paddle attachment with my mixer for a few minutes to make sure it’s thoroughly combined. Cover and let it sit out for 1 hour to autolyse. Gently pick up the dough, stretch it, and fold it over on itself several times, cover it again, and let it rise for another 30 minutes. I do this every 30 minutes for 3 hours, then I cover it and stick in the fridge. For this loaf I let it rest in the fridge for 18 hours. I find better sour flavor develops with more time. 

Take it out of the fridge a few hours before you want to bake it. I put my dough in a well-dusted banneton (proofing basket) and let it just sit there slowly warming up and rising on the counter. I did this for 3-4 hours. Then I heated a Dutch oven in the oven at 450F until it got hot. Turn the dough out of the basket onto a square of parchment, dust it off gently, and score it as you wish. Pick up the parchment (this dough will be super soft so the parchment is the easy way to move it) and put it in the Dutch oven, cover it, and put it in the oven. Bake it covered for 30 minutes at 450, then remove the cover and bake for another 20 minutes. It will be very brown and crispy. When I take the cover off, I throw a few ice cubes in the oven just to create a bit of extra steam. 

Take it out when it’s done (internal temp should be 210F) and DO NOT CUT IT for at least an hour. I actually leave mine for two, minimum. Cutting it too early will ruin your hard work—the best texture comes from well rested bread!

If anyone has questions about my starter, feel free to ask. I've had this one for about 6 months and it seems to be chugging along pretty well. It's made with whole wheat flour and I feed it with either unbleached all purpose or wheat."

A note on substitutions--use the cheese you want to use! If you only have cheddar, use cheddar--but know that that little bit of cream cheese really does help the texture so use it if you can. Heat your skillet well, then melt 3 tbs butter until it foams. Add 4 tbs white flour to make the roux, and cook it just until it starts to smell a little nutty. Whisk in **2 cups of milk** (I used a silicone whisk). Let it bubble a bit and start to thicken. Whisk in an additional **can of evaporated milk**. When it's fully thickened, stir in:

4 ounces grated manchego

4 ounces grated Oaxaca cheese

8 ounces grated cheddar

2 ounces full fat cream cheese

2 ounces dry white wine

1 tsp Worcestershire sauce

1 tsp Dijon mustard

1/2 tsp garlic salt (plus more if you want it more salty)

1/2 tsp cayenne pepper

1/4 tsp nutmeg

black pepper to taste

So you mix all up to make your mornay sauce. Cook the sauce thoroughly, then whisk **two eggs** (I used eggs from our chickens, so aim for medium eggs). Take 1/2 of the mornay sauce and whisk it into the eggs, then whisk that all back into the sauce (off heat).  This is called tempering the eggs, and it will help them thicken the dish without scrambling.  The eggs serve to help it all set up in the oven, but if you don't have eggs they're not strictly necessary. 



All while you're doing this, cook a pound of pasta shells (I only coked it 5 minutes, 3 minutes less than the box said--baking will finish the cook). Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water. Drain the rest, and stir the pasta into the sauce. Drizzle a little of the pasta water into the sauce if it's too thick.



You will also need, for the topping:

Crackers crushed up (I used a mix of stale cheezits and saltines from the pantry) mixed with 2 tbs melted butter and a few tbs grated cheddar

Clean the sides of your pan, and then top with the crumb/cheese mixture. Bake at 425F for 20 minutes.

GifRecipes,fqubb2k,t1_fqu5dbi,1589655638.0,Are you over proofing? Are you letting it sit too long after you score it? What hydration % are you working with?
GifRecipes,fqub44r,t1_fquaxal,1589655530.0,"Yes, salt, sorry, autocorrect issues, I'll edit. 

Well I'm glad to hear they tested it, because I swear I've never seen a real difference but when you hear something so many times you start to question yourself. I find it's easier to incorporate the salt in the beginning, too."
GifRecipes,fqu8gf9,t3_gkyrlm,1589654051.0,"Dang, that is a high hydration dough! Looks amazing. 

Here's a questions for you--do you really find that adding the salt after the initial autolysing stage really yields better results than adding the salt in the beginning? I have heard it can inhibit the process, but I've never noticed a negative effect on my dough."
GifRecipes,fqu85ev,t1_fqu4sma,1589653881.0,"It's a texture thing--it toasts well and has a nice chew to it. However, I usually go for a slightly tighter crumb with my sourdoughs because I like it better (for all the reasons you point out). [Here's the latest one I made](https://imgur.com/a/asoZIZZ) and it came out with a pretty nice texture. These really high hydration doughs are pretty neat, though, they're tricky to work with so a lot of home bakers aim to master them."
Cooking,fqu0n18,t1_fqu01g8,1589649722.0,"I'm not the OP, but I've made game hens a bunch of times. I make a rub with a little baking powder and salt and pepper, rub it all over the hens, and let them dry in the fridge for about 6 hours before I roast them. That gives you crispier skin.
