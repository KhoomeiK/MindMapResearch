depression,f25vw6w,t1_f25pr68,1569985193.0,"Nah, it's okay. I don't mind getting messages when it's something I can relate to. There's something cathartic about talking to people that understand where you're coming from, especially on a topic that's usually scarcely talked about. So thank you for commenting!

Aaaa, I get that. I just don't function well without at least 10-12 hours of sleep. I don't necessarily sleep only at night thought. I have a horribly habit of sleeping during the day and being awake only at night -- or sleeping during the day and waking up at 5pm. lol. It's a bad habit, but I'll always opt to sleep over not. I don't want to be awake for longer than I have to be.

Damn, I get that though. When I was a teenager, I used to have really bad insomnia. It sucks a lot. Even after my doctors gave me ambien, it still only helped half the time. If I took it and it didn't work, I'd just end up hallucinating (mildly) from it. I'm sorry you struggle with insomnia though. It's miserable and I'm so glad I've jumped from insomnia to hypersomnia. I don't know what I'd do if I had to be conscious all the time. 

Thank you for your well wishes! I appreciate that, though I feel like I've largely given up at this point? It's been 15 years since I developed this mental illness and every year, it gets worse. I feel like I was born seeing the world in ravishing technicolor only to lose a color every year. One day it feels like I'll only be able to see the world in shades of gray and that's a depressing thought. 

I definitely relate with your sentiment about ""caring less about winning"". For me, I don't have a destination I'm wafting in the direction of anymore (that life is lost and I don't believe I'll ever meet those goals. It's just time to accept that for me.). Every day is a struggle to survive and every day that I wake up in the morning (or at night), it means I've lived to see another day."

depression,f20ym0o,t1_f1z1etl,1569865646.0,"It's really something, isn't it? I'm sorry to hear that you're able to relate with me. I wouldn't wish it on anyone and I'm so sorry to hear how much you're struggling. I don't have any words of advice, unfortunately, but I'm not sure you're hear to ask for that anyway.

That's decidedly relatable. When I think back on who I used to be (so young and eager and full of hope), it's almost like I'm seeing an entirely different person. They no longer exist anymore -- and they never will again. I ruined my own life and mental illness and disability didn't help. I'll probably never be able to fix it because I can't stand to be awake long enough to even try. I just want to go to sleep one night and never wake up, barring that we'll see what happens next."
depression,f20wcsu,t1_f1zckuv,1569864878.0,"I'm sorry to hear it. I wouldn't wish being back on highschool (especially with mental illness) on anyone.

depression,f20w56j,t1_f1zky6s,1569864809.0,"Thought what, exactly? That I don't need to be sleeping all the time, even though I definitely will be? I mean... yeah, my family is on my ass all the time for having obnoxious sleeping hours, which make it hard to get a hold of me. I don't really care though. If they prefer me alive, they'll have to deal with my sleeping like a cat."
depression,f20vsgp,t1_f1zosoh,1569864694.0,">  

I'm 31 and I'm legally disabled, so the government pays me because I'm unable to work. I'd say I'm lucky to be allowed to sleep all the time, but really I wish I were healthy and able to actually contribute to society. Nothing really changes on a daily basis. Every day is the same and it's? a thing. Sleeping is the only thing that keeps me from killing myself. I might eventually do it anyway, but for now I'm just content to sleep.

I'm sorry to hear that you're suffering too. )8 I wouldn't wish illness (mental or physical) on anyone."
depression,f1ykdp5,t1_f1ykayi,1569818066.0,Good luck! I wish you the best with that. Hopefully we both get a little lucid dreaming done. I know I would sure love to focus the direction of my dreams into something a little more eventful.
depression,f1yk32a,t1_f1yjz6k,1569817882.0,"Huh, I've never heard about that before, but you know what? I definitely need to look into it and research the concept. Thanks for letting me know!"
depression,f1yjohh,t1_f1yjhh4,1569817659.0,"A sleep mask? Like a cloth mask that covers your eyes? I used to have one of those a long time ago (I was working night-shift and needed it to block out the light to sleep during the day). It never helped me with lucid dreaming though. : O 

Granted, however, I was never actively attempting to train myself to lucid dream, so that probably negates the mask."
depression,f1yjcik,t1_f1yj9ed,1569817468.0,"Unfortunately, I can't. I wish I could though! I just have no control over what my dreams are going to be. One day they're mundane and about grocery shopping and another I'm fleeing from dinosaurs and being flushed into the ocean. lol"
depression,f1yeqa0,t1_f1yegju,1569814893.0,"Not really, but also kind of? I was legally disabled as a child due to mental illness and ADHD, but that fell away after I was later adopted by other members of my family... since then, I've only recently become legally disabled again (in the last year) due to both mental illness and an auto-immune disease.

Also, I think I'd be the same, but I sleep so much that I rarely have time with my own thoughts -- and when I'm awake, I keep myself busy through reddit or youtube so I don't have to think."
depression,f1yawco,t1_f1yap56,1569812947.0,I'm so sorry to hear that. )8 I can't even begin to imagine what I'd do without it. It's literally the only thing keeping me actually alive right now.
depression,f1yasey,t1_f1yag6z,1569812888.0,"Yeah, I do. There's no one here but me. That's both a good thing and a bad thing, I guess. Probably if there were someone else around, I'd be more active in my daily life... but... I actively choose to spend all my time sleeping, so I'm kind of relieved I don't have to deal with it.

Though once or twice I've had family come around and knock on my living room and bedroom window to wake me up so I'd let them inside (the front door to the apartment complex is locked). That's usually after they don't hear from me for a long time, though, so when I am awake I try to text them at least a few times a month so they know I'm alive still."
depression,f1xlp8d,t1_f1xlbbk,1569800233.0,"This is exactly it. It feels like I'm living alternative, albeit successful versions of my life in my dreams. Sometimes my dreams are mediocre, but even then I have emotions again and I can at least function properly in my dreams. Other times, I'll have outrageous dreams where I have a ideal career or even something fantastical that can't possibly happen irl. Either way, it feels like I'm getting a glimpse into who I could have been had I not been so ill."
depression,f1xklhf,t1_f1xbp8n,1569799736.0,I hear this. One of the things I love about talking to people that are just as depressed/suicidal as I am is the dark humor that comes out of it.
depression,f1xjvxe,t1_f1va3w2,1569799388.0,"Honestly? That's understandable. I can only be friends with *some* people with mental illness. If all a person does is vent about how miserable they are, then I probably can't be friends with them. It's too much negativity and it drains the energy from me and puts me in my own depression spiral.

However, if I make friends with someone and we can talk about other things like common interests? That's a can-do. It's even better when you can relate to these people in regards to whatever mental illness you have and it's not a chore to talk about it, but cathartic. 

In my experience, it's just a fine line between ""too much"" and ""just enough""."
depression,f1xjatz,t1_f1xin03,1569799131.0,"Honestly? I only eat once a day and I never feel hungry anymore, so my need to eat is never a problem. It's honestly probably a good thing because it's helping me lose weight, lol. 

I'm an adult and legally disabled, so I can't/don't have to go anywhere during the day except doctor appointments, which I usually end up cancelling. I get out of the house about once a month to get groceries (maybe... it depends because sometimes I can't muster the energy to get out of bed, so I just opt to not eat instead). I guess I'm lucky because I don't have kids -- especially since I wouldn't be able to take care of them when I can't even take care of myself.

I honestly just sleep my life away, but I prefer it like that. My dreams are the only place I feel alive. I actually have emotions again and sometimes my dreams are able to motivate me (usually by dreaming of doing whatever it is I need to do) enough to get out of bed and do basic chores around the house or go grocery shopping."
SuicideWatch,f1xicst,t3_db0jzm,1569798725.0,"Especially since some mental illness is genetic, I wouldn't want to pass that on to them (much less the physical illness I have that I got from my mom)."

Trufemcels,f1xgfyp,t1_f18ungy,1569798007.0,"You've got the wrong term though. Asexual just means you don't feel sexually attracted to people. Most asexual people want to date and be in relationships with other people. It's actually harder for them because usually (but not always) sex is off the table.

The term you're looking for is ""Aromantic"", which is when you don't feel romantic attraction to other people. Ironically, aromantic people can and still sometimes do want sex from other people. 

Only people that are aromantic asexual (aro ace) don't want a romantic relationship or sex from other people."

depression,f109pv8,t3_d7dnt2,1569109377.0,"Honestly, depression is not a competition. Just because someone might have worse depression than yours, it doesn't mean that what you're experiencing is irrelevant. Everyone deserves to be heard and you're absolutely important. Please don't dismiss your feelings in the favor of someone who ""has it worse than you"".

That said, I definitely think you should seek professional help. They'll be able to help with not only with a diagnosis, but potential treatment for the way you're feeling."
depression,f106s95,t3_d7dhqu,1569108165.0,"Honestly, yes and no. It pretty much starts and ends with me not leaving a suicide note as a thrown up middle finger at my family, but that's about it. I'm too tired to be more outwardly malicious about it. )8"
