AskReddit,fr10coe,t3_glpvsa,1589810738.0,I honestly think the people who need to record themselves helping out the less fortunate and put it up online. You shouldn’t be feeding your ego at the same time.

 He’s alright! Got a family of his own and has had a stable job for a long time. The quality of life at times is up for debate, but I think he made the best of what he could and he’s content now."
ADHD,fqpmo13,t1_fqpi7ro,1589549883.0,Bless you. My mother refused to put me on any medicine because the way it made my older brother “not be himself” (he quit taking his meds after the first year and dropped out ultimately in 8th grade). Nothing but my best wishes for you and yours!
ADHD,fqok275,t3_gjua6l,1589517071.0,Thanks! I honestly needed to read this tonight. It’s tough when it feels like the wheels are spinning but I can get any traction.
ADHD,fqojsj0,t3_gjy7og,1589516883.0,This is literally exactly how I do my mental math. lol
ptsd,fqoiby5,t3_gjxcmv,1589515893.0,"My memory seems to come and go. I have had PTSD since around 2. Always had a great memory, to my misfortune. Sometimes it’s like a fog just moves into my mental space for an undetermined amount of time. You’d think I’m perfectly fine usually, but even though the lights are on nobody is really there to answer. I’d spent countless night silently weeping into my pillow praying for whatever higher power existed to wipe my slate clean so I couldn’t remember any of it. 
Now I feel like there’s random things I’ll forget that aren’t normal for me. I’m also currently trying to be alright with the sudden ending of a three year relationship, so it’s possible it’s linked to my worsened mental state currently instead of my normal, but bad mental state. 
It’s scary looking at statistics and stuff especially when they say we have a higher chance of getting dementia.
To me it’s kinda ironic. The way I see what happened to me was they were stealing time. Precious time of what could’ve been learning to love, trust, make friends, laugh, be happy, or even feel safe one time, were taken from me. And because of that I run the risk of losing even more time while I get older. 
Rip to this game. Idk who I’m paying my bill to at the end of this life, but if I get dementia you can bet my sweet cheeks I ain’t tipping when I see them."
ADHD,fn3rbom,t1_fn2qr77,1586626405.0,This. I’m going to heavily incorporate into my daily life. Thanks for sharing!
CrohnsDisease,fmydjth,t3_fxvalq,1586483659.0,"I can honestly say the abscess was much more painful. I didn’t know what it was when I first got one(I was young and didn’t have any diagnosis) and rolled up a rag to bite down on and popped it like a pimple(booty-hole adjacent). TMI, I’m sorry. 
I legit teared up though. One of the worst things I’ve felt. 
 I also believe this is why I ended up with a fistula. 
Currently think I have one starting to form again... rip to my peaches. 
At least we’re in quarantine and I’ll be close to a run for epsom salt soaks after it’s resolved."
ADHD,fmxtrro,t1_fmw7dpg,1586471710.0,This is me. Every single day. Multiple times a day.
ptsd,flscuxi,t1_flr07e5,1585439307.0,"My therapist has been working with me on breathing. I’ve realized I tend to naturally take short, quick breaths. I’m still trying to make it natural to take deeper and slower breaths. The breathing exercises have helped some I’ve noticed though!"
ptsd,flscbv8,t1_flrvig1,1585438975.0,"I’m sorry to hear that. I am glad to hear you’re working on it, and that I was able to help when I myself felt extremely helpless when writing the post. A lot of these tips and tricks people have kindly shared on here are things I’m going to dive into and try and see what works and what doesn’t.  
I wish the best for you!"
ptsd,flrsx71,t1_flrsr6r,1585427173.0,"Thanks! Yeah, I see a therapist currently. She’s referring me to a psych, but I’ll remain with her because she’s the first good therapist I’ve come across so far!"

ptsd,flrri7f,t1_flrnes9,1585426311.0,"I’ve actually been thinking about taking yoga up! I’m not sure starting out in a group would be something I’m up for, but I know there’s tons of resources out there on how to do beginners positions and how to breathe, etc. 
while I’m off work I’ll try to incorporate it into my morning routine since it’ll be easier to try to start the habit now."

plants,ep5zk7w,t1_eo68fcf,1559062803.0,"Not sure if you were able to figure out what you had pop up, but based off how it’s growing now I believe it to be the morning glories I had planted. They’re really starting to take off and get more vine like and they’re the only ones like that I planted with this bunch!"
relationship_advice,eox7oly,t1_eowf269,1558920192.0,"Yeah, it was truly life changing! I appreciate the sympathy, but it’s what has made me who I am and helped cement the type of person I wanted to be.  

I am sorry to hear that about the strained relationship with your grandma. While it’s always unfortunate to have family who treats you like nothing it’s nice to know there’s family outside of blood relation. I’m happy to hear your son is doing well now!"
relationship_advice,eowap3h,t1_eovkavh,1558907289.0,"Truest statement. My biological father was extremely abusive, and put me in traumatic situations time after time. 

Got away from him when I was twelve and made one of those life long friends who became a brother. His family literally loved me and cared for me in a way I’d never felt at that point. They gifted me clothes on Christmas and birthdays (I  didn’t have many at all), and always took me on family vacations. To this day his step-dad looks out for me and has been my dad. I’m truly lucky to have found them."
