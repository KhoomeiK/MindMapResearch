dating,fl1midn,t3_flvohs,1584731936.0,I'm going through this right now and it's annoying. So yesterday I decided not to text anything just to see if he would text me. Got a text at 11 something that night asking how my day went. I did respond. That kind of settled my nerves so I sent a text this morning...still nothing. I'm not sure what to think or if I'm being too emotional.
