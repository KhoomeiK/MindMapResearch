Those opposing the government are less likely submit their views. 

However your last paragraph is sadly untrue. The Burmese people have never been able to stand up to the government, and their support has rarely mattered. The country was closed off for many years, and there’s a whole generation of people who didn’t get a proper education as a result. 

From the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12990563) : “1990 - Opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) wins landslide victory in elections, but the military ignores the result.” This went on until 2011.

-  take in a university college. There are so many to pick from!

For Europe, it’ll be a bit chilly in April/May unless you did somewhere like Spain, Portugal, southern Italy (Sicily?)  or Greece. All have good beach options, wine and sunshine."
travel,f6hklc9,t1_f6esux9,1572852848.0,Ooh looks great. I’ll definitely put it on the consideration list if I return to Mexico!

travel,f67ik0v,t1_f67bkhu,1572719868.0,Definitely agree. Piccadilly line all the way is the easiest choice.
