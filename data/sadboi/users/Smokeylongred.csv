JUSTNOMIL,fqwfxkm,t1_fqw2zwo,1589703002.0,This is usually true buuuut... there’s a rare genetic condition called trimethyaminria which causes a strong fish smelling body odour no matter how much you wash. I don’t think that’s the case here but if someone seems really clean and still smells there may be other reasons

Endo,fqpbfvh,t3_gk3myz,1589541598.0,"Today I had a bad endo flair up. Bleeding, pain in my ovaries and this weird feeling I get like my uterus is dragging down. I have stage four five endo and have had excision but the symptoms came back within six months. 

Thank goodness I was working from home today otherwise I would have called in sick. Even working from home was difficult as I had to take strong painkillers."

I assumed it was all friends but he said he’d seen my stuff on insta and followed it and randomly then recognised it at a market. Really cool!
infertility,fq55ftx,t3_ggv9yu,1589093111.0,"Same. Having to say happy Mother’s Day to everyone including my sister while I sit here with shrivelled fucking ovaries and endometriosis.

We should have a happy infertility day where we eat scrambled eggs and drink bottles of wine. Finish up with soft cheese and sushi and all the thing pregnant women can’t eat. And listen to music with lots of swearing."

I thought massive bleeding, enormous pain that made me puke and not being able to walk properly was totally normal. Plus when I saw a doctor as a teenager she said (seriously) ‘oh redheads always get bad cramps’ so my mum obviously didn’t take me seriously. Diagnosed at 35 with stage four/ five endo. Infertile and had two operations. Absolute hell"

It’s more about where the endo is and how deep it is but doesn’t mean you might have worse symptoms just because the stage is lower.

food,fo28rmx,t3_g56j62,1587453411.0,So in Australia gravy is brown and you eat it with a roast usually or any cooked meat. The colour and consistency of this is not what I think of when I hear gravy. So the negative comments might be from aussies to whom this does not look great! Having said that I’ve always wanted to try proper American biscuits and gravy- even though in Australia biscuits refer to something sweet so it’s even weirder!

If you’re posting for upvotes why are you trying to get validation from the internet? Your best art critic is you. Post if you want constructive criticism or post if you love what you’ve done and want to share it but don’t just post in the hope of upvotes.

I personally think you have a lot of talent and I hope you keep drawing but maybe think about why you post and what you want to get out of it. I post my stupid cartoons because I want people to get a smile out of them and feel happy, not because I want them to make the front page."
