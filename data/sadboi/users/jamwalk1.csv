I have a month to return my unit so I'll see what the new unit is like and if it's the same I can probably assume that it's normal."

sony,fm2l5mp,t3_fo2cmo,1585699727.0,"I have both headphones and will try to help you out here.

The WH900n has more features, better noise cancelling and better sound than the WH700.

The WH700 has good sound but only basic noise cancelling, no carry case and does not fold up. If you want a carrycase, you'll need to buy one separately. The headband is also a little bit ""creaky"". The WH700 is good for the price though - I got them for £70 and was very happy using them to listen to music on Spotify. I never had any connection problems with these headphones - the connection to my phone is very stable.

The WH900 has touch controls, LDAC capability and better noise cancelling. I also think that they sound a little bit better than the WH700s.
The WH900 comes with a carrying pouch and can fold down to fit onto a bag etc. I'd still probably reccomend getting a harder case though.
I occasionally got slight connection problems when listening to music on Tidal over the highest quality LDAC setting (i.e. stuttering audio) , but this was rectified by lowering the bitrate in my phone's developer options. 

Both headphones are very comfortable and I can wear them for hours. Battery life is also great on both sets as they both offer approximately 30 hours of listening time. Charging times from empty to full on both is quite long though, but both also offer a quickcharge function that gives you a few hours playback on a short charge.

Overall, if you want a good sounding pair of headphones but are less fussed about the active noise cancelling, touch controls or LDAC capability then you would probably be happy with the WH700s.
However, if you want the more ""premium"" features and better sound and noise cancelling then the WH900 are definitely worth picking. 

I hope I've helped you make a decision. Let me know which you picked :)."
headphones,fkoi6pr,t1_fkoag2l,1584387716.0,"Yeah, I'm going to look at getting a case for them. 

All of the gripes I had with these headphones are minor, and don't really get in the way of my enjoyment of them. I just thought that they were worth mentioning when I was writing the review.

Thankfully the battery life is so long that I hardly ever need to charge them. I think I have only needed to charge them about three or four times since I bought them.

You need to turn them on to make them sound good with the wire because there is a built-in amp inside the headphone. The amp gives the sound fullness and volume, which is why it sounds good :)."
headphones,fknyije,t3_fiubn2,1584376528.0,"I got these in December for listening to Spotify through my phone. They are really good for the price.
I gave them a four-star review as I had a few minor gripes - i.e. the lack of any kind of carrying case, the long charging time, the lack of USB-C. However, the sound quality, battery life and connectivity of these headphones is fantastic and well worth the £70 I paid for them."
