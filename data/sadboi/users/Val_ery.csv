answers,foyepdw,t3_ga2m2q,1588171168.0,"Because we have a brain in our guts!

Okay this sounds crazy, but there are groups of neurons located in the mid section of the torso. They are more related to feelings and sensations rather than logic because they are related to the endocrine system. They also cause the sensation of butterflies in the stomach. That is because when you see someone you like it causes a flight or flight response and your body is trying to survive so it cuts the blood flow on your internal organs briefly. That's what you feel. That group of neurons work a little bit by themselves. And it's related to very basic functions. When you see something like an injury or something painful it's the same thing as the butterflies. It's a fight or flight response but because your brain is like chill there is nothing wrong that could happen to me, your ""stomach brain"" it's like HOLY SHIT WE RUN OR PUNCH OUR WAY OUT!"
GameTheorists,foyc1tb,t3_ga5h9k,1588169740.0,"If the endermen come from the ancient builders that doesn't negate that they couldn't craft ender Pearls. The process should have been gradual and they could have learned how to craft them before  they completely  transitioned to endermen. The reason we get it from them is because the ender have them, probably because the ancestors craft them. Like some other objects that you can interact with but not craft, like the pieces of the end portal. 

And maybe the dragon doesn't attack the endermen but by his behaviour with the player, maybe it was hostile towards the ancient builders, and the ancient builders towards the dragons, because we know it wasn't the only one because of the dragon heads on the boats."

depression,fof3mxc,t3_g6yfkt,1587724838.0,"I don't have any idea what you are going through. But even if everything seems numb and dark and boring, just think that someday it will get better, and you will look back and be very glad that you didn't make a decision of no return. Talk to someone. You may think your friends don't care but in my experience the good friends care more sometimes than your family, because they choose to socialize with you, not like a family that you just happen to have because you were born with it, like the color of hair. (I don't have the best opinion on families, but yours can be a good one)
And if you can't talk about this with your friends or family, talk to a stranger. I found that helps because they have a blank page on their opinion about you and it's relaxing to think you'll never have to talk to them again. (If you want, I volunteer)
And obviously talk to a professional. It helps A LOT, trust me. Your head is making you think this way and it's a disease like a cold or flu. It can be deal with.

The quarantine doesn't help, I know.

It gets better, seriously."

I'm not rich but I was always told since I was a child that I was a genius and that I will get to wherever I wanted to in live. That's really high expectations to put on anyone. Don't obsess about it. It's your live and you shouldn't have to live it with the expectations of someone else. Just... live like you want. I know that right now everything is not that interesting but try something you like or something new. Get a new hobby to spice things up. And talk to a professional if you aren't currently. It really helps. Now I see live not like the grey thing but its brownish and salty. Little by little.

If you get a disease easily avoided with vaccines and then you have to go to the doctor or you die they are going to give you antibiotics and there is a chance that the pathogen mutates and the vaccine for the old version is no longer compatible with this pathogen 2.0 and the updates are expensive. That's the same risk about auto medication.
