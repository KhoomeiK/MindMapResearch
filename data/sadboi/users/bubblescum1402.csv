BipolarReddit,fnajuek,t1_fnaamkd,1586798753.0,"that's so so so relatable. my mania could last anywhere from a week to three months or more, and the drugs caused the worst delusions ever. it's great to hear you were able to quit! (and i'm uber jealous of your med-free lifestyle lol)"
BipolarReddit,fnajla9,t1_fn9pxj2,1586798630.0,"thank you so much for sharing, along with the kind words! i sometimes (and i think a lot of us) forget that while our swings can occasionally be a bit burdensome, we are so loved and needed by our friends and families."
BipolarReddit,fnajao6,t1_fn9nbus,1586798483.0,"i hope you know how much power that sentence holds. being self-aware is so important for us. glad to hear things have chilled, and you've made it out ok! 

if you're comfortable sharing, may i ask what your med cocktail is?"
bipolar,fb3s10d,t3_eb9lut,1576485976.0,"nah, you're not just paranoid. I feel like those with bipolar, especially those who've experienced more than a couple of episodes, are more intuitive than most other people. you likely can't trust those people. think of this as a superpower, if you're able. :)"
bipolar,f7k7hoa,t1_f7k5cro,1573797196.0,"Also, best of luck and wishes to you as well. I appreciate your words. You have a friend in me should you ever need one."
bipolar,f7k7g9s,t1_f7k5cro,1573797156.0,"Yes, yes, yes, yes and yes. Everyone was talking to/about me, even on TV, and everyone was in on the sick joke. And the following time was so fucking emotionless and sad. It's like only remnants of my true self were left. Like I was living in a shell. It was so horrible. But to look back on the last few months, and see how far I've come, it feels really good to know I was able to build back myself back up.

Something that really helped me to heal and reconnect with both myself and family/friends was to look through old photos, reminisce the good times w/ ppl, and hit up old friends on social media. That was extremely therapeutic. But then again, I'm a HUGE extrovert/people person."
bipolar,f7k78y4,t1_f7jzvwl,1573796950.0,"Totally relatable. All I can remember is the fear I felt and thoughts I had (as described above). Good luck and best wishes to you, friend. Always here if you need someone."
Antipsychiatry,ezwigia,t1_ezwgnxl,1568217429.0,i feel this too. i had some extreme stress going on. meds def aggravated it
Antipsychiatry,ezwa3m9,t1_ezw6c6y,1568211818.0,"Agreed, in some ways. Some people genuinely need them- especially those of us with psychotic features.

Unfortunately, at least for myself, the long-term use of antidepressants and other mood stabilizers actually CAUSED more problems than they were supposed to fix. At first, i had some mild depression bc of bullying/harassment at school. The pills though... They MADE me suicidal, completely numb. The long term effects of the meds i was put on caused me to develop Bipolar II (eventually re-diagnosed as type I).

Now, i'm dependent on Lamictal to keep my mood swings in check. But had I never started Lexapro at 15, then cymbalta (the highest fucking dose, prescribed by a psych doctor who talked to me for about 10 minutes while inpatient), abilify, then wellbutrin in the first place, i probably wouldn't have developed Bipolar disorder at 17.

A healthy lifestyle + that little bit of lamictal keep me steady. And yet, my psych nurse practitioner continues to push and push and PUSH all sorts of sleep aids, anti psychotics, anti depressants and anti anxiety meds. How can anyone trust these people?

Again, some people need meds. But maybe, some only need them because they were forced on them to begin with. Then they "" need""more to fix the side effects."
