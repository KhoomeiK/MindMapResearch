I have been using both heat and ice but just still so unsure of how often.  And would you be able to give me more information on how I could best prop my arm up when sleeping and sitting. I use pillows but I'm just so unsure of the best position for healing.

I found this but it looks like it's not talking about specific counties but this might be a good site for you to have on deck. You should be able to google search ""\_\_\_\_\_\_county ohio restraining orders"" and i think something should pop up.

Most helpful people for me to talk to when i  was trying to figure all this out were the advocates working at the domestic violence resource center in my town(they do restraining orders) (you may be able to contact other places that handle domestic violence or sexual assault and see if they can help guide you) , a free lawyer consultation i did via my states ""state bar website"" (ohio prob also has a state bar website but idk how the law works when it comes to minors and lawyers) and talking to the people in the ""family law office"" at the courthouse (they also conduct restraining orders).

I was always under the impression Suboxene specifically blocks your ability to get high off other opioids and it looks like this article is saying the same thing.

taken from the article

""Buprenorphine is a long-acting, high-affinity partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor. As a long-acting agonist, buprenorphine prevents withdrawal and craving and stabilizes opioid receptors. As a high-affinity agonist, buprenorphine blocks other opioids from binding, preventing abuse of other opioids.  ""  So my assumption here based on that article and what friends who take suboxene have told me in the past, is that no you wouldn't get high off the dilaudid. I had a friend in the past who also took suboxene and he said the same exact thing."

I usually will have some sort of mini panic attack and cry. What really does help the most is being in control of your breathing. You'll notice we tend to hold our breath or breathe extremely fast when we get shots, making us significantly more tense and making the process more difficult. (Nurses always have to tell me to slow my breathing, try not to tense/clench muscles) The goal is to slow the breathing down and have it be more ..""normal"" and relaxed. It really does help. Other than that i would assume Benzo's would be the drug to make a shot the easiest. Ketamine too in the sense you'd be numb af."

At least in my state in the US, if u get charged with something petty as a minor it'll most likely be expunged and b pretty much non accessible by the public. I don't know how it works though when it comes to charges received as an adult. I just know that, juvenile records often get ""sealed"".

My charges from when i was a minor were expunged and my record was ""sealed"". Sure, i guess the charges are technically still ""there"" but i don't think most people can really see them and they 100% do NOT show up on criminal background checks. I've called my county's sheriff multiple times asking about this ""well are those charges visible to anyone or to employers??"" and every time they tell me not to worry about it because it's unlikely anyone will be able to see them at least when it comes to employer background checks because they ""seal juvenile records"". So p much i've had those charges for 11-12 years and i've worked plenty of jobs and it's never been an issue. You could call the county sheriff where ur charges are from and ask them about it.

Before that, it wasn't so bad. Now, i gag on it if i can taste it at all. I am a terribly picky eater and if i'm sober i find it hard to eat in general unfrotunately.

Not an old erowid method, still see it today on reddit, and CWE is especially for Poli. The HBR is the ones i used to see on erowid, which involved all kinds of chemicals and processes and absolutely does not apply to poli, and CWE does not apply to HBR. 

Word yeah i have no idea either. 

I'm not really sure why. No idea. I just decided to one day, i did the CWE and had it sitting in my room and then i had a horrible panic attack one morning and thought ""well, no better time than now to try this out again"" and it actually was super helpful and gave me a wonderfully calm/anxiety free day aside from the G.I issues. But emotionally/mentally, it provided a lot of relief. Since i had that good experience i thought i'd up my dose a bit, but that's when i had a miserable ass time so i haven't used it since.
