tax,fna4u33,t1_fna19pp,1586791050.0,I just draw art for people and didnt record the 100s of transactions with that much detail. I just jotted it down on paper in a list. I'm not claiming expenses at least. It's all just artwork ranging from $1- $400 in cash or online. I cant really verify most of them because they are often random people and I dont know them. I understand keeping receipts or invoices for expenses but I dont see how I could have supporting documents for random art pieces sold to strangers.

depression,fka95bl,t1_fk7qauz,1583997406.0,"Dont listen to people telling you how you should feel. College can be insanely stressful. Then some have student debt and even with a good degree it can still give you massive stress. 

I graduated 6 years ago now and you should know that once you are done and can support yourself you wont care about your friends or parents stupid opinions. You'll be busy building your life the way you want. I know its cliche but their opinions will just seem hilarious in a few years. Even people nagging you about marriage/kids will just bounce off you because you'll be so busy building what you want and doing whatever you want. You'll have freedom and will have to answer to no one. And if you get married and have kids you can build your family with your spouse how you guys want. Your friends and parents will nag maybe but you'll be busy living how you want. Goodluck."

depression,fk26tmi,t1_fk1uu9i,1583794376.0,Proper hugs are pretty intimate so if you're not used to it you can be really uncomfortable. A quick half hug is nothing but if you go in for a proper close hug where you both kind of release some stress it can seem to intimate for some people. I find people who played any kind of close contact sports are usually pretty desensitized to it and dont think much about hugging.
depression,fk25ezm,t3_ffzzxz,1583793528.0,"The weird thing about college is how you can be in a lecture hall or area with 100s of people and feel more alone than when you actually are alone. Sometimes even sitting with classmates you know can feel isolating because everyone acts either like they have everything going well or that they are totally cool with all their current disasters. 

Sometimes even dating someone can feel lonely because they might not genuinely care about your struggles and just want the fun parts of you. Same with family and friends. It ends up feeling like you're relationships and interactions is just about putting on a show and providing fun and energy to those around you so you arent the black hole in the room."
depression,fjxwmxn,t1_fjxq57h,1583685045.0,"It's not about getting anything back. It's the satisfaction of lessening someone else's pain at their worst. I'm not talking about being a slave to friends and family. I mean more helping in a charity environment for physically/mentally disabled or people who's health has made it so that can't look after themselves. Making sure someone is not injured in their home, taking people out who cant go out alone, food services, helping someone who doesnt have family go to medical treatment. These sound like a big headache but the satisfaction from helping someone who literally cant do these basic things without you is much higher than most people anticipate. Doesnt fix depression but it gives a strong meaning to life besides paying your bill's and being a slave to ungrateful family and friends."

One thing that helps keep me going is being responsible for lessening someone else's suffering. It doesnt stop my depression but I feel like I have to keep going and it helps make enduring life somewhat worthwhile. I guess.

depression,fjp0a0k,t1_fjo7rag,1583538729.0,Awareness is gstting better every year though. What's odd to me though is whenever you see statistics on depression and mental health it seems like a very high percentage is suffering so how could the awareness and understanding be so low?
depression,fjp049p,t1_fjoe6qp,1583538624.0,You are going to make a really good nurse. It's a really tough job and you will be stressed out so bad but if you care about people it will be so fulfilling. It's one of those careers that you can have the most impact on a persons life. I've seen how some patients treat hospital staff even getting violent and the way some nurse and techs are able to continue on with their shift dealing with that stress is amazing. The good ones are literally Angel's.
depression,fjozih1,t1_fjnyzgn,1583538228.0,Look at you with your slick wordplay 😉
depression,fjozdts,t1_fjo9dgw,1583538145.0,They are so awful and people not realizing how bad they are makes it hurt so much more. I think doctors and nurses are just human and most dont understand that you get a debilitating physical response to it. I had one doctor tell me I should be happy I have them because it will make me perform better at work and hobbies etc. They clearly didnt understand the difference between nervous butterflies and panic attacks.
depression,fjoyxaw,t1_fjo76el,1583537847.0,This is the best advice. It's actually better to seek a solution while you're feeling bit better and not put it aside. A lot of us wait until we're really sick and need help asap and then cant get it. And the exercising helped me more than I thought it would. I hate exercising but I love the way I feel from a workout. I do it every morning now just to get that feel good high to start the day on.
depression,fjoycmb,t1_fjo6onz,1583537475.0,I'm so sorry to hear that. You were basically kicked while you were down. My family member was in a psych hospital and we were as involved as possible because anytime you're relying on humans to do their job properly it's going to be hit or miss. There are great nurses and doctors but there are also horrendously bad ones because that's how humans are. But unlike other professions you cant risk being at the mercy of the bad ones when it comes to a persons mental and physical health. It's sad you are basically scared to get help that you may need because it may cause more damage than help.
depression,fjoxuge,t3_feel0k,1583537148.0,"I had a similar experience. Find a GP, it might take a few tries, who takes you serious and try to come up with some possible solutions. Do a lot of research on your own and dont just blindly trust anyone. I have severe anxiety and panic attacks. It's so bad and people who haven't experienced them often dont understand and that includes doctors. 

It would be a good idea to get some bloodwork done and whatever other tests your doctor will recommend. Also take a look at diet and exercise. These things might not be causing the panic attacks but you want to try everytbing and see if you can even lessen it. I found making sure my blood sugar was level throughout the day helped a little.

Some doctors will automatically want to put you on drugs and maybe that's the solution but please do your research. I used micro doses of beta blockers (5mg propranolol) and it really worked. It was the most amazing thing to not have massive panic attacks just taking the bus. But I had bad side effects and couldnt use it more than a week. I know people who have done well on drugs and people who have done horrifically bad on them. The key thing is educate yourself and make informed decisions. 

Sorry that was freakishly long but I have had this happen to me and just reading your post made me so angry. They dont understand that anxiety and panic attacks create a massive physical response and its unbearable. How could people be so callous? Find solutions to manage it so you dont have to rely on going to the er again hopefully. You sadly cant rely on them."

SuicideWatch,fj00fwh,t3_fas3s3,1582883193.0,"I didnt see it but I was nearby when a woman jumped infront of the commuter train and let me tell you it is not painless or at least not always. I completely forgot about that until I read your post. Stay further back from now on so you dont get any spontaneous thoughts. Also my sibling recently tried to kill themselves and failed and it was not good. So hopefully you're too scared now because remembering that works for me.

As for financial problems just remember they can always be fixed. Some things in life cannot be fixed but finances can. Debt can be fixed. It can always be fixed. It's why bankrupsy exists. You dont want to do that if you can avoid it but there is always a way to fix it.

It sounds like you have a lot of big problems but sometimes it's better to focus on small things that may even seem insignificant. Small improvements and goals add up quickly and can set off a domino effect. Something as simple as a minor health goal or cleaning goal or something silly like 10 pushups a day(oddly works for me) can hit that first domino down. It's hard to explain you just have to try it. Just start there and put your bigger problems to the side for now. Just focus on teenie micro goals for now that will improve your present short term situation. 

Focus on today and this week and your small goal(s) and nevermind about the big stuff and the years to come for now."
SuicideWatch,fizzkbc,t3_farqrw,1582881927.0,"My life and mind is probably in a similar state. The only reason I wouldnt do anything is because my sibling recently tried to kill themselves and failed and the damage from the attempt was really bad. The hell their life is now makes their previous state look like heaven.

I know that numb feeling where your minds like a black hole and nothing good can enter but those extreme periods do pass and lessen. When you get to a point where you can think again try coming up with ideas of ways you could improve your life even just a teenie bit. Just one small thing and do it. Really small goals related to cleaning or health are my go to. Or it could be to find a way to pay a teenie bit more on your debt each month. Small amounts add up. 

Sorry if that didnt help at all. Thought I'd at least try. You should definitely put off what you're planning though and not be spontaneous with something so extreme. Also after reading your post I actually do care about you even though I haven't met you. In some ways we know people on here more than people in real life. It's weird."

glasses,fimg8oj,t1_fikz5bq,1582529046.0,It's not a myth hes just saying that you dont need to follow the rules of what others think looks best. Standard beauty is to have your face appear oval whether you're a man or woman. People with square or diamond faces or just any sharp edges tend to look best in rounded frames. If you're face is wider at the top you want to make it appear less wide. If its wider at the bottom you want to create an optical illusion with the frames that make the top of your head look wider. Your face is pretty even from top to bottom and you have a nice sharp jaw and face lines so rounded frames would look good. At the end of the day it's up to you if you think that looks good tbough.
glasses,fimfptw,t3_f80jyl,1582528445.0,"Definitely rounded glasses. Whenever you have sharp jawline you tend to look good with rounded glasses. There are a variety of round glasses with some just being circles to having tons of different top frame shapes.

I mean I know I'm very pale and have a mole on my neck and thin eyebrows and hazel eyes and attached earlobes. But that's how I remember everyone else anyways. I memorize specific features about people. So I tend to know whether a persons earlobe is detached or not and what piercings they have and any birthmarks lol. Distinct wrinkles also help.

When I try to explain to them I cant recognize people out of context most people dont realise that it includes people I see daily. I have ways of identifying people though in a room. Usually I memorize birthmarks or some feature and I also tend to recognize voices really well. I've never met someone else in real life with this. It would be nice to know someone else who has this.

Dyslexia,fbzqil5,t3_ee5gjh,1577256487.0,"Man, I wish people were more aware of dyslexia when I first went to college. I was failing classes because I couldn't follow formatting or couldn't memorize really simple symbols and was flipping things all over the place haha. They must have thought I was nuts back then. Plus now we have access to spell checker which is a huge lifesaver!! Good luck, make sure you deal with any issues you are having immediately and stay on top of things."
Dyslexia,fbzq4vb,t1_fbtpcvz,1577256001.0,Don't hesitate to post because you are worried about some grammar Nazi on the internet shaming you. They're the only one who should be embarrassed. Besides don't you have spellchecker on yours? I literally have every second word corrected haha. I definitely get a panic attack when asked to write something by hand at work or school in-front of people who don't already know I have dyslexia.
Dyslexia,fbzpoxx,t1_fbtm4w9,1577255450.0,"I'm okay with people being ignorant if they are willing to learn and understand. It's annoying trying to explain it to people over and over again but we have to remember that they don't have dyslexia and I'm often not educated on everyone elses disability/health issues either. What matters is that someone is willing to understand. If they aren't then ""F"" them lol."
Dyslexia,fbzpdoa,t3_ef7d4y,1577255070.0,"If it only happens a few times then I wouldn't be worried. Normal people do have brain farts like this. If this is a daily struggle for you then I would be very suspicious of dyslexia. Typically it would be something you've struggled with daily you entire life and should be sort of obvious that there is something wrong. We tend to get good at trying to appear normal that we create very creative work arounds for all our symptoms to the point where we almost fool ourselves into not noticing a problem. If you stop and think about it then if should be pretty obvious though. It's also typically not something you can stop doing and instead you create workarounds. So for example you wouldn't be able to stop seeing ""read"" as ""red"" no matter how much you try. I'm not a doctor or an expert this is just what I've witnessed from personal experience as someone with dyslexia and known people with it. Dyslexia is varied and I'm sure there is even a spectrum."
Dyslexia,fbzojtb,t3_dtqb3i,1577254068.0,"I think symptoms can vary and a lot of the common symptoms may not apply to you so the online tests are not a good indicator. I honestly don't think you even need an assessment, you already know what you're having problems with and don't really need a title for it. The only thing you need to focus on is functioning the best you can and understanding how you learn. I've had to get really creative on how to function in work and school settings and what works for me won't necessarily be relevant to someone else. If it wasn't for spellchecker I'd probably come off as uneducated or really stupid to people who don't understand dyslexia. I can use my phone if I have to write by hand which is a godsend."
AskReddit,fbrhuhc,t3_ee2ps8,1577043018.0,I was in the crib and had to go pee and understood I would have to pee myself because I couldnt talk yet. I cried because I felt helpless and my mom came. One of the first things I remember communicating to my parents is that I would like to use a toilet and not pee in diapers anymore.
AskReddit,fbb5vy0,t1_fbamxmb,1576693964.0,"They arent wrong, relationships take a lot of time and energy and if you arent able to support yourself yet you need to be spending 100% of your efforts on getting there."
AskReddit,fbb5m6u,t3_eccwli,1576693802.0,"I would get her to learn just a little about hair, makeup and wearing girly clothes. I would educate her on oral hygiene and how being on it 90% of the time isnt good enough. I would make sure she really knows that money is important and if you dont find a way to make a good amount of it you could get yourself in really bad situations."
