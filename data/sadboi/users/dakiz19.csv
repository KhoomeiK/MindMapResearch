Also, there is speculation that these experiments are ongoing.

Edit: one source of many. http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/unwanted-sterilization-and-eugenics-programs-in-the-united-states/

""Gregory W. Rutecki, MD writes about the forced sterilization of Native Americans, which persisted into the 1970s and 1980s, with examples of young women receiving tubal ligations when they were getting appendectomies. It’s estimated that as many as 25-50 percent of Native American women were sterilized between 1970 and 1976. Forced sterilization programs are also a part of history in Puerto Rico, where sterilization rates are said to be the highest in the world.""
(Excerpt)

Largest reason I highlight Hispanic and black women is it continued into the 70s and 80s. The court case a lot of you mention is from the 20s. I do however acknowledge that eugenics also discriminated against low income and mentally handicapped and violent offenders. I also did not realize how bad this had affected Native Americans.

Edit 2: Sadly after reading more of the article I posted mentally handicapped were also sterilized into the 70s."

2007scape,etuuiyv,t3_cdh69b,1563220268.0,"This still feels to me like a lot of great new content and ideas being tied to an unnecessary new skill. It feels like the crafted set items could be introduced through other means (e.g. new quests, new areas, new diaries). Even unpicking and resmithing could be added to remove items for xp without creating a new skill. It feels like real world logic is being used to fit real world problems like pacing, but does not fit in-game logic. Warding as I see it is simply a combination skill of crafting and magic, or crafting and runecrafting. The only real reasons I see for the ability to make these items not being added to current skills is because players have already levelled these skills and would be able to immediately produce said items, or content would be voted against due to payers having already raised those skills and seeing no point to adding them. To be clear I love the idea of imbuing items through new means and I believe that magic gear needs upgrades and should be craftable. This however could be introduced without the need for a new skill, just as several other skill combination activities such as head reanination for prayer and magic without turning the game upside down and introducing a new skill that is simply put ""magic crafting "".

Edit: TLDR: I want the content without the skill. I am not sure if this is realistic due to likely player opposition."

I just didn't care for the Duncan character in that book or the heavy emphasis on gender differences. The Duncan in God Emperor just didn't feel like Duncan from Dune to me, but also people are changed by their experiences.  Then with Leto's views on gender I like to think people's behavior can't be so simplified into patterns, but I also understand that it was supposed to be a pattern only he could recognize due to his unique perspective.  It was still a good book and we'll thought out it just didn't ring true to Mrs on those few things, which were front and center in a lot of the story. Sorry if that served vague.
