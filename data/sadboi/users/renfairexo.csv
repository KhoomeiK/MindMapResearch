He‚Äôs my baby and has been there through the shit show of the last 6 years, sleeps with me, always wants to be with me, etc. My kids have never experienced death either, and I think my 13 yr old at least would want to ‚Äúbe there,‚Äù and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs ok or would just cause trauma, and I can‚Äôt explain to my other dog (they‚Äôre brothers) where his brother/companion went, etc etc etc. I know I‚Äôm not the first person to ever deal with this lol but it is my first time dealing with it as an adult, and my kids first time (they haven‚Äôt even experienced people they know/love dying or anything yet) and I just have a lot of anxiety about it.

My next appt is next week. I suspect she will up me to the 60 next before anything else. My biggest concern is that it seems to kill everyone's appetite but it doesn't mine at all. I almost feel like I'm not even taking anything lol. The main reason I started it was for the binge eating stuff, but I'm also ADHD so two birds. I hadn't been medicated for the ADHD in a lonnnnng time. I do feel less chaotic in my brain, like less obsessive and overwhelmed? so I know it's doing something, just can't really pinpoint what."

I don't feel the comedown or anything either. I do feel like it helps me not bounce all over the place like I was doing, and I am more successful at checking off the to-do list, but wasn't a cure-all for sure. For the food part, it also doesn't kill my appetite, but I do go longer without eating, where I used to have an issue with binging. More like I'm just busy and don't eat."

I currently only have the one journal I've been writing in off and on for like maybe a year and a half. I let it all out, but I have always destroyed them.
