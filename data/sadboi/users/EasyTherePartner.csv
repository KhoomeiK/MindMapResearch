Here is my advice, go slow. When I first started I was so scared of side effects and would it do this and could it do that... I froze and didn’t take it at all. My doctor made a comment that finally made me take a leap of faith- I would never get better if I didn’t at least try. 

They told me to start at 5mg... I started at 2.5mg. Took it for a week and waiting for any side effects or symptoms for a week... admittedly, just gagging and a headache... and then bumped to 5mg. Did that for two weeks and then bumped to 7.5mg and then so on and so on until I got to 20mg. Baby steps are still steps forward. 

Would you wear glasses if it meant you could see better, or would you just squint and make things harder on yourself and just deal with it? You can do this, go slow, you got this!"

While it did help a little bit with the anxiety, my brain just didn’t function well and I need to be able to think clearly haha. I plan on asking my doctor for an alternative, or finding out how long this lasts. But for now, I’m off it so I can think clearly. 

I’ve seen online it’s a silver bullet for some and it’s perfect, and others have this issue. Not sure if it’s a temporary issue that works it self out of not. Worth asking your provider.
