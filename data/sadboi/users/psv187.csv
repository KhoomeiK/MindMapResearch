depression,fpp6ib8,t3_gep758,1588796815.0,"I can relate as I feel exactly how you do. Since my kid was born I feel like I lost a huge part of myself. I don’t believe you mean any of it in a bad way; having kids can be a huge change to someone’s life. Try and make time for yourself and do things you enjoy even if it means being a bit selfish. I gave everything up and never made time to enjoy my life and ran myself into the ground/depression. I think that if I had allowed some free time to myself that it would have helped me handle the stress. Your not alone, take a moment to breathe and think things through."
Frugal,fpox20q,t1_fpoa1ub,1588792133.0,"Agreed, good list, wish I had thought of these when buying my first home. Even if you don’t plan on having kids buying in a good school district might be a good idea as it can bring in more potential buyers should you ever want to sell."
depression,foe77cy,t1_fo9y75o,1587697415.0,"How do you deal with this? I’m going through the same myself, like I’m crashing and have no way out. I haven’t found anything that helps."
Coronavirus,flf1dc3,t1_flf1519,1585095876.0,"There’s a Joe Rogan podcast that had a good discussion regarding Coronavirus, came out about a week ago but might still be a good listen."

personalfinance,fl14g9z,t1_fl0vlgq,1584721818.0,"That’s what will probably happen. Probably a program similar to the home affordable mortgage program (HAMP), may go by a different name if it’s still around. I would hope given the circumstance that being approved will be much easier than during the mortgage crisis. Most will probably be looking at deferring payments to the back end of their loan maybe as a balloon payment but more than likely by extending the term of the loan."
slingtv,fkw5ggf,t1_fkw0k0j,1584583892.0,Just lost fox and nbc here in Dallas too.
Coronavirus,fksszr4,t1_fksrkho,1584497692.0,"I’m sorry to hear that, it’s a tough situation. I think our government let us down. Companies will work us till the very end unless something drastic happens to protect employees."

Coronavirus,fksr81v,t1_fksqwjo,1584496528.0,I don’t believe we’ve gone to extreme measures to contain it like they did. Not sure how this will play out for us.
CoronaVirusTX,fkpeobi,t3_fjvktw,1584408312.0,"Agreed, this is the reality about corporate America. Unfortunately, not many people can afford to quit their jobs even in a situation like the one we’re in now."

Dallas,fkntdo6,t1_fknsc8p,1584373517.0,"Not just you unfortunately. We are still business as usual even though we have laptops. Company is still making us go out and complete inspections, it’s unbelievable. Like you said, they don’t give a shit."
China_Flu,fkj3q2j,t1_fkj1ugn,1584235427.0,Thank you for the response. I appreciate you taking time to answer our questions.
China_Flu,fkiqx4o,t3_fibm0c,1584226509.0,"I can’t seem to find an answer to this but, if I’m in my 30’s and have high blood pressure, would that make me more vulnerable?"

FinancialPlanning,f8vnmpb,t3_e2h8ls,1574873481.0,Went to a local university and graduated without taking out loans. Avoided buying a new car put money into 401 and savings and worked OT whenever possible. Didn’t take trips or buy fancy things but now in my 30s live a comfortable life and never lose sleep about paying my bills.
