BPD,fohtf6s,t3_g7g79b,1587772297.0,"It's so hard. I need to get of SM but I just CANT. I NEED to know if my FP has seen my posts. The only reason why I haven't deleted SM is because that's the only form of communication that some of my friends have in this time. But because of that, I can't stop checking their status. I know it's toxic. But because I can't see those friends that I only talk to over SM.... I can't completely erase them. And I know unfollowing them is the best thing towards healing.... it hurts too much. I hurts most than harming myself. SM is a curse, but I wish that I wouldn't lose friends (that don't have texting capabilities) because of it.  

I'm going crazy is what I'm trying to say. I'm trying not to check it. I set my phone in the basement and currently on the second floor and I set a time limit on myself only to check it at 11. Those limits I seem to be ok on."

It would be stupid to transfer with one semester left. My parents pay my way through college (which is why I fell immensely guilty for feeling like this and I hate myself for it because I am so privileged). Accounting sucks and I've never wanted to do it but I need to make a living salary. My parents don't even want to hear the reasons why I don't trust them."

introvert,fmftuxe,t1_fmftfn7,1586034726.0,True. It's only a once a month thing anyway. I keep a close eye on myself and only buy alcohol during that one day. I don't really drink otherwise except for a glass of wine when I'm out to dinner

BPD,fmcyn8m,t3_fuh1xv,1585955527.0,"I’m having that exact same problem right now. I already don’t have a lot of friends to begin with and being ignored just makes it so much worse. In the one group chat I’m in I’ve asked a number of times if anyone would like to Skype because I’m lonely and I get left on read. But then when someone else asks, everyone responds. I sent a heartfelt (or what I thought was) message to them all today and no one responded.

Do I just care too much? Is everyone annoyed with me? It hurts a lot because I feel like I have a lot of love and support to give during these times but no one seems to want it. I’ve been making daily lists of things to do on my Snapchat story to help people keep occupied (and to entertain them. I try and make them a little bit funny) and my friends ignore it, but people I barely talk to reach out to tell me they like them. I’m really proud of the lists too (up to 300+ list items) but they just ignore them.

QueerEye,eucol82,t1_eua4cso,1563681346.0,"I agree with you completely. I also grew up in the rural Midwest and I’m not proud to say that I harbored some homophobic thoughts growing up. But the only reason why I thought that way when I was younger was because that’s all I knew. My family and I would go into the city maybe a couple times a year, but other than that I was completely sheltered from other mindsets. I was lucky enough to get the chance to move out of that area and into the city when I was in my teens and therefore I was able to change my mindset quicker at a younger age to be more open to other people’s differences (and to finally figure out and accept that I was bi lol). 

The hero reminded me of my mom in a lot of ways. 5 years ago she was pretty against differences in sexualities. The process of getting her to open her mind and see the world from other’s perspectives was a loooooonnnggg and gradual process that’s still ongoing because she firmly believed that she was rooted in her long-held beliefs. But what helped her start to change was slowly being exposed to people not like her—and I see that happening with the hero. I know it’s not a popular opinion to treat homophobic people with compassion and go gently nudge them in the right direction, but in my experience it helps to create longer lasting change. I really appreciated this episode and I hope that the hero being on this show may help him see the LGBT community in a positive light that he may never have experienced otherwise (minus Karamo and Tan retching at the farm animals, which I found really disrespectful)"
