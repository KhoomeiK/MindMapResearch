I decided to see how my cat's doing. So I searched for him in his bed, all his favourite spots, but I couldn't find him anywhere. I got worried a little and started to look in all the wardrobes, behind the bed and basically turning the apartment upside down, while calling his name all the time. He's nowhere to be found. I get out of the apartment and start running around the complex, calling him, thinking he may have gotten away somehow. He's an indoor cat so he doesn't go outside at all. No cat in sight. I come back to my apartment, and open the window to see if he's outside. I'm basically crying, thinking I'll never see him again. Now, my cat LOVES looking out the open window. Whenever he hears someone opening the window, he comes running. So, I don't see him from the window and decide to look for him outside. I close the window, turn around and THERE HE IS WITH HIS SMUG LITTLE FACE. I have no idea where that little fucker was hiding, but he hid damn well."
