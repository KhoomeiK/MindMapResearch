depression,f7q8nja,t1_f7oauy9,1573960347.0,"I’ve been there. I think of it as the “wanting to get help but...” phase. Please make it top priority to talk to someone, anyone, at peer support services. If you are to the point of having cognitive-limiting symptoms, don’t suffer alone in silence. No one deserves that. 

I don’t know you, but that’s something I wish I could tell “Past Me” to do. I could have saved myself so much wasted time and unnecessary pain. I’m also sure that you are a lovely, talented person who the world needs, and you’ll thank yourself for doing the uncomfortable and scary work of reaching out and communicating that you’re hurting and need help. 

Run, don’t walk, to get help. You’ll be wishing you’d done it sooner 🙂 

P.s. congratulations on making the first step and making the appointment. Just remember, your health (mental and physical) is priority!"
depression,f7o9h71,t3_dx2la6,1573923494.0,"What you’re experiencing is common with depression. I’ve experienced it, my mom recently has been in “the haze”, and many people in support groups and treatment that I’m going to have talked about it.

THAT SAID — there is help. You don’t have to endure this alone. IMO this is a serious symptom and a huge warning sign that you’re mind and body is in crisis. You don’t have to “push through” it and there is a way to feel better and get out of it.

Whereabouts do you live? What’s your living situation? Do you have people that know about what you’re experiencing and that can be with you?"

Or passing food from one person’s chopsticks to another person’s chopsticks. Basically doing anything with chopsticks outside of just picking them up and astonishing nearby Japanese people that you can actually use them to transport food to your mouth."

dating,ezcch96,t3_d0rh3f,1567833053.0,"Oh man, I know this feeling all too well. I have no answer for either of us — I myself had a good date this evening and am scared to get too invested or let myself be happy about it. Having been on many dates and also having had that experience of “falling” for someone only for it to have it not work out, at this point I just try to treat every date like an interview process, as well as be completely open about what you want and run away from anyone who doesn’t seem all in or who can’t give you want you need. The right one is out there, don’t give up!"

dating,eyftajy,t1_eyf9bhk,1567054644.0,Thank you for your encouragement.

Here’s to trying to keep our heads up and hearts open!
dating,eyela3l,t3_cws8vr,1567035373.0,"I feel you hard on this. Have you tried a three strikes rule? Although if it were me, I would give them two strikes for suddenly rescheduling dates, since it’s pretty inconsiderate on their part and shows you that they don’t value your time. You deserve someone who makes you a priority, and should spend your time with people who can show common courtesy and don’t make you question your own sanity."
dating,ewzssek,t3_cqtyzx,1565900254.0,"As someone who has been in this same position in the past and struggled with feeling anxious and uncertain about dating someone who I was really into (and worrying about smothering them and/or scaring them off), I can totally relate to how you feel.

Something that really helped me was just getting back into a basic self care regimen and reestablishing what I needed and valued in life. Journaling helped with this, as did reading self-help books, seeing a therapist, spending time with supportive friends and family and getting unconditional love — I had to cut some toxic people out of my life unfortunately, but in general just adding joy and clarity to my life that had nothing to do with a romantic interest has made all the difference.

Overall, I think I have learned better coping mechanisms for my stress (which, to be honest, I was just projecting onto my love interest in the hope that their “love” would make my problems go away). Learning how to self-soothe and deal with my own insecurities and anxiety (therapy is great for this!!) while doing a consistent job of doing basic self care has worked wonders in my own self-confidence and mental health, and as a result, I can approach new relationships with openness and a security in knowing who I am that I will be okay and loved regardless of how this person feels.

Hope this helps, and best of luck OP!

Edit: grammar"
nostalgia,ewqj8p8,t3_cpjd1l,1565667569.0,"Oh man... this reminds me of a bad judgement call I made with a bunch of these in elementary school.

I thought it would cute to randomly place a couple smiley faces on my arm, then maybe a couple hearts, then suns, then turtles, added a few more to make sure the composition balance was good, then a few more to make sure the colors were well balanced as well...

Suddenly, I came to my tiny child senses and realized I had absolutely COVERED my arm in stamps to the point where it looked like a dense tattoo sleeve. I went to a pretty conservative Christian school, so you can imagine the look on my teachers face when I sheepishly asked to use the bathroom to wash it off...

TLDR: accidentally gave myself a temporary tattoo sleeve with stamp markers"
