Utterly imbecilic, which is why free-market fundamentalists like you cannot cite specifics and instead must refer to a nebulous concept of ""nature""; something that you cannot even prove is natural. [Moreover, you conflate the concept of natural with good.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature)


There has never been any human endeavour free from power dynamics; all interactions take place within already established power structures such that no two parties are ever on equal footing such that an interaction can be truly free. 

It is ironic that you would call me a bootlicker when you literally argue for policies that will further entrench the power of the wealthy. You do not wish to address the real problems that arise out of the wealth inequality created by laissez-faire capitalism such as worsening worker conditions and regulatory capture because these are endemic to the system you advocate for."

Foodforthought,fpd1ewd,t1_fpcs902,1588517762.0,"The government is intervening on behalf of those who hold the most capital. The government isn't some disconnected abstract thing that's just intervening for the sake of intervening.

The reason that the rich can hold sway over the government is because they ultimately decide what policies the government will enact, and the reason they can do that is because the fruits of capital are overwhelmingly reaped by those who own it.

You cannot somehow divorce regulatory capture from the capitalist system that literally created it, as though these bad politicians and private beneficiaries just somehow popped into existence from the ether. There never has been a free market. There never will be a free market. The overarching systems were always controlled by those who hold the most wealth, and therefore the most power, in society.

The reason companies pay shit is because workers are divided, replaceable, and have nothing but awful alternative options. Almost no one wants to be on food stamps if they can avoid it. It is a miserable existence. If you remove safety nets, they will not just up and leave their jobs; they will be even more shackled to the shitty conditions they currently have to endure."

Plus it pairs well with scry and retain, and 0 cost cards. In the easy fights, you can usually one shot small slimes and louses, and it can draw you through dazeds or give you playable cards a bit more quickly in the sentry fight. 

Reach Heaven does more damage but is a bit slow for my liking, Wallop does less damage but has defence (also a decent card early imo), and Signature Move isn't something I ever take tbh. Carve Reality is great, but if not upgraded, it usually ends up doing 30 damage if you don't draw it in the same hand as a card to get you into wrath.
