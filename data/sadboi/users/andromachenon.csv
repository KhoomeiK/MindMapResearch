traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fn0k4x9,t1_fn0ibse,1586543414.0,"i agree with you on the first point.

on the second point, like i said anything can happen. more of what i was thinking was online dating (and people usually tend to text before meeting even if they met in passing), where you are actively gauging interest in people, and where someone who is transphobic will very likely say some shitty things about it. but of course, if someone is hell bent on hurting you, they will find a way to do it. and of course, if you’re meeting someone real time, there’s not much you can do but go with the flow, but in the aforementioned scenario, it’s just one more layer to get through to show a persons true colors. but yes, my initial comment did leave out real-time meeting. (personally i don’t talk one-on-one to anyone real time without messaging first because there’s too much uncertainty going in blind for my liking.) 

on the third, we know good and well that that can and often does happen, just as much as it does to rape victims. that’s why i mentioned “trans panic defense” bullshit that stands in court sometimes. it absolutely should not be anyone’s fault for getting hurt, but unfortunately our society loves to find any reason to put down anyone who isn’t a cishet white male. i do see your point with the last two quotes, but at the end of the day, like i said it’s one more layer to get through. 

but my main point i initially made is being upfront not really to avoid assault, but to just avoid everyone being embarrassed and feeling shitty for getting to the point that clothes come off and someone has to say “erm, i’m sorry, i didn’t know what i’d be working with here and you’re beautiful/handsome and all, but i’m not really attracted to you now.” because then you go home and feel like shit and they feel like shit for rejecting you based on that. of course there is exceptions to everything and bottom surgery is a thing (generally more effective for trans women just because of where our surgery options are at), but you see what i’m saying hopefully."

and, when it comes to serious relationships: don’t keep secrets. with virtually anything, not even just trans things. it all just causes problems later on.

AMA,fmq0brc,t1_fmpnm30,1586290568.0,"he’s 15, went through a traumatic event, and learned to move on through therapy. letting something so traumatic affect you deeply for a long time is unhealthy and will mess you up. also i don’t see anywhere him blaming his parents for him bullying his little brother—from what i’m seeing he blames the fact that he was being bullied himself and had nowhere to take the anger out on. that’s not deflecting responsibility, it’s acknowledging that certain behaviors have roots that need to be addressed, and it sounds like those roots were addressed appropriately."

asl,fminvh0,t3_fve09a,1586113327.0,"honestly i don’t like when people are really stingy about the homework thing. like, if it’s an obvious “do this for me,” then sure, go away. but then if someone’s like “i don’t understand this part of my assignment,” they‘re brushed off and told “we don’t help with homework.” but then if they just say “i don’t understand this” and don’t mention it being homework then they’re in the clear!

honestly, they’re taking the classes, they’re putting in effort to be in the program, i don’t mind giving a helping hand. brains get fried sometimes, i understand."
