But during the Easter Event my main huntress died and I decided to try out a knight. I had gotten so many melee UTs that were filling up my chests, I needed to do something with them.

At first it was stupidly difficult. I keep running away the moment things even looked hairy. But with a ranged class it wouldn‚Äôt of mattered, I could run away and deal damage. But not with a knight.

So what did I do? I for one made sure to feed the knight potions I had gotten from previous classes. Then I went to God Lands and practiced how to really be a knight. Learning how to dodge, standing my ground when taking damage, took shot patterns that I have learned and put it to practice, etc. When I got good enough I did Sprite Worlds and Snake Pit to farm speed and dexterity. Stayed in groups when fighting Event Bosses and got tons of potions from that. 

I died on the knight a bit later into the Easter Event. Got to maybe 3-5/8 because I got confused at the Avatar and ran into his shots. So I made a new knight. That knight is still with us at 2100 base fame and 7/8. I love playing as the knight now, the game just feels so much more fun. The power behind every shot, the constant chance of death, using reflexes to always dodge, etc.

It‚Äôs all about trial and error but learning from your mistakes. Play to a classes advantages. Having another class to feed the knight is always welcome however."
