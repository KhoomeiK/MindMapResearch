As I ran up and fell on my knees 
Authority approached 
Primal instincts act as a coach 
They saw me flee the scene heading South 
Heard shouts, that’s word of mouth. 
Months carried on since I fleed the country 
Nothing has been safe little food been hunting 
Miles deep in a forest abridge 
Had no will to live but a smidge 
Life can be cold like a fridge.
Life was different before that one day I dipped. 

A stranger to my life that I had once lived 
I left school for fun but my life went to shit 
Ended up in a North Eastern Ukrainian Village
No storefronts to pillage and no bitches and women
I laid my head down in shame and self pity 
For I had left school and ran from my city.

Guys don’t ditch school with 900 kilos of Hydrogen Cyanide Fr."
