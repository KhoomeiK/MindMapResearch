BPDlovedones,eyqimwz,t3_cy948o,1567344341.0,"It’s so scary second guessing yourself, I feel for you and hope you find someone who is healthier mentally because as you said, nobody is worth dealing with the sheer mental turmoil people with BPD cause. You ain’t crazy."

BreakUps,eykdn0e,t3_cx6blx,1567146392.0,"No matter how hard I forgave THEIR mistakes it was never good enough because they cherry picked my issues after all the love, care and support I tried to give them. It’s so unfair that every night is spend thinking about how I fucked up the relationship after all the terrible things they did to me."

ExNoContact,ey7p2c2,t3_cvwedm,1566893400.0,"Thank you, I needed to hear this."
BPD,ey7kkd0,t3_cvkb29,1566887212.0,"Man this is such a well timed reminder. It's super difficult but you are exactly right, the short term relief isn't worth the long term pain and potential to see something that will only hurt me. I just need to be reminded that It does get easier and the urge dissipates so long as I stay occupied and don't fall back into that mindset. Thank you :)."
BPD,ey7jtcu,t3_cvq5ho,1566886316.0,Thank you for giving me more understanding of BPD. As someone who dated someone with BPD your post really aligns with the way my ex acted.
ExNoContact,ewkm1ll,t3_cooh9a,1565488086.0,"Yes, dreaming about being with them as if all is normal then waking up to reality really puts a damper on the day."
