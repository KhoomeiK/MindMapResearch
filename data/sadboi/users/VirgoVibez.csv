Her best friend in this novel is also LGBTQ! Her other novels I‚Äôve heard are great she has a new one and *The Poet.* Two novels to learn about autism are *The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime* and *The Reason I Jump* highly recommend the latter but both are good. No romantic interests. *Dear Martin* is also a great novel and so is *When I Was Puerto Rican* that can offer some cultural perspective !
