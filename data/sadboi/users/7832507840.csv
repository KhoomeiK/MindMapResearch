this was the case with one of my childhood friends. he was abused and put through hell. he didn't tell us the extent of it, the only thing we really knew was that he was pretty much confined to the basement as soon as he got home. dont know when but at some point his mom took away his xbox, and only let him do homework and read books when he was out of school. he's since moved to his dad's but he kind of stagnated. smokes a lot of weed now and has a low-paying job at dunkin donuts. but i dont blame him for all that he's been through. he has had some pretty severe emotional outbursts in the past which leads me to believe that he lives life severely depressed and on edge at all times. life just doesnt ever seem to go his way anymore. he hardly has any friends that i know of. damn. i need to reach out to him.

JuiceWRLD,fphwkbd,t3_e8zrwz,1588629129.0,"saw ur reply & creeped a bit lol. nobody knows if he was off drugs before he made that decision tho. it seems like it had to've been relatively split second because from what i read the cops were closing in on him and he had all those pills. couple that with the fact that he's severely depressed/anxious/struggling with addiction and it starts to make more sense. addiction is a really cruel thing. it hijacks your mind's reward system, making you crave the drug and oftentimes take risks just to chase that high feeling. then it turns to relieving anxiety/depression but that's besides the point.


to recap, as i said earlier, juice was probably being closed in on by the cops and had that 3lbs of weed plus all that codeine & percocets. he definitely was weighing his options: prison, or probable death. because of his severe depression he was almost certainly thinking death would be better than jail, not to mention that in jail he'd be deprived of/limited to one or two pills a day (to prevent potentially fatal withdrawal) so he'd be more stressed and depressed throughout the day whilst dealing with jail stress too. on top of all of this, he was definitely super stressed about the cops closing in, so maybe he didn't put as much thought into it as he should've and just popped a bunch because he thought he'd be relieving his stress. 


so with all that in mind i feel like it makes more sense as to why juice would've 'chosen' to OD. in spite of all that i said above, i know how painful it feels to listen to his music and remember that he's gone. and if you've used his music as a crutch during desperate times of suicidal thoughts/panic attacks/addiction i'm sure it's a lot harder for you than it is for me. just hang in there. i take comfort in at least knowing that if there is any type of afterlife, juice would be in heaven or its equivalent. he always reached out to fans to give supportive comforting words and genuinely cared about the wellbeing of each and every one of us. he will be missed, but he's in a less painful place. try and remember that ðŸ’™ 9 9 9 ðŸ’™"
