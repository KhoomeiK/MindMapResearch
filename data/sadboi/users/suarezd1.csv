Checking in, you'd think I was prepping for surgery.  As for  Newark, getting permission with the tower was a rather welcome break from reality for everyone.  The tower chuckled throughout and the only thing we were told was to watch out for wake turbulence when a cargo plane came in during our go around.  My school thought it was funny, my CFI thought it was funny, the tower thought it was funny, and I still think it was funny.  And to me it was an incredible experience that still has me glowing even though I was about to cancel while walking from the parking lot into the flight school.  Aside from my personal stuff, I got a call from my manager at Dangerfield's (I'm a comedian) that our long time waiter Chario had passed away in his sleep the night before.  The club recently celebrated over 50 years and he was still there as the longest serving employee aside from the owner who was co-owner with Rodney himself.  If anyone has ever been to the club you know who I'm talking about.  As someone who worked with the old man for over 4 years I was always in awe at his longevity and his ability to call back jokes from over 5 decades in the game.  With the club having been shuttered for over a month, I know that that's what killed him --- being away from the show.  I was told that he checked in on Friday asking when they were going to open and the word is MAYBE in May.  So whatever, we always talked about flying and thinking about him made me sad enough to question flying.  But he always insisted that the show must go on so I did.  RIP CHARIO!"

When they first told me at the counter about landing fees you think it would have been astronomical --- Are you sure you want to land there?

She asks for her donation - $500 - and I balk trying to play dumb because I am not wasting that money on this wildebeest.  I mess around and start to mumble how I need to hit the ATM and shit but she was standing in front of the door and I was pretty much in the middle of the room.

I get my hand on the handle and I pull it open using my body to block her and just bull rush out.  BOOM.  The door hits the stopper she had engaged.  I'm like fuck.  At the same time the bathroom door opens and I see this huge motherfucker try to reach out and grab me.  In my head I said if I dont close the door and pop off the door stopper I'm dead.  I have money on me, my watch, my jewelry - this dude is going to rob and kill me.  I don't know how but in that same instant I closed the door as the chick grabbed me and I flicked the stopper back and opened the door fast enough to slam the door into the dude's face and block him.  I ran out the door and sprinted to the elevators.  None opened right away and I could hear them chase after me.  I saw the emergency stairs so I just jumped as many steps and railings as I could until i got all the way to the lobby.  I'm a big dude and I played college ball but I'm also now 350lbs.  Haven't moved in like 15 years.  But that night?  Holy shit.  I made it to the lobby and took a cab home where I cried my face off and never visited a hooker since.
