techsupport,foxwo3e,t1_foxugq3,1588158816.0,"Yeah thats what I was thinking in regards to the PSU. Honestly, I have no clue software wise. Thats why i'm thinking of resetting OS.

It could also be something to do with my bootdrives, my BIOS had problems recognizing what boot drive to use (it was booting off HDD rather than SSD w/ OS)

I'll let you know if the sata cables make a difference.   
I have a feeling its my wall socket, but idk"

None of the voltages were going out of whack, and the cores were keeping around 80C. PC didn’t turn off with both of the tests. It seems that when my PC is under full load it can’t handle it...

This could be a PSU or MOBO problem I think.
Also would like to note that my PSU creates a whining noise when I try to reboot it straight after shutdown..."

I also noticed this one reading ‘TMPIN2’ was almost at 90C

Honestly, might be a form of bipolar, or I’m just a moody bitch, I don’t push my mood on anyone so I don’t worry them.

I feel like a menace to anyone, I do something and it backfires on me for no reason, which is why I distant myself away from anyone. It’s a fucking curse"

Honestly, I think I just sound a little jealous/angsty. But it’s happened a lot of times where I don’t think it’s a little bit of a coincidence.

As for the friend aspect. I agree. I have a group of friends that I’ve maintained since I’ve been born really. But ever since I’ve gained new ones through university, is where the contrast has really shown me who they are."

Honestly, I feel lonely all the time even being around friends and family. It’s heartbreaking and mentally draining.
What I do (and want to do) is focus on MYSELF, I already know that I can’t get to someone or I’m not as significant in someone’s life as I want to, so I’m really left with myself - so why not focus on the one person I rely on.

I’m a bit tipsy atm so I’m probably not one to take advice, but if you’re left with yourself, spend quality time with yourself - find a passion, with me it’s creating art and music. Try and find other people in similar situations. Find something you LOVE, and if you can’t, talk to someone to discover it. Feel free to hit my DMS of you want a chat or anything - I’m open at all times.

I want to leave you with one message, don’t feel alone in this battle. I know it seems you are, but there is someone on this god forsaken world that is going through the same struggles - one of them being me. Keep refining yourself, read a book, mentally progress yourself. And get out there! For me, I needed a reminder that most things in this world don’t get handed to me on a silver platter, I have to actively find it.
God bless, and I hope your situation in life gets better. X"
