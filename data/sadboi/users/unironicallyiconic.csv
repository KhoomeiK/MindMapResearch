I made one design that grew pretty popular and I make $200-300 per month off of it, but if it hadn't blown up I would probably only make about $30 a month."

Minecraft,ey60qyd,t3_cvkopj,1566844757.0,I'm not over-exaggerating when I say this gave me an anxiety attack.

depression,ey49ruz,t3_cvds78,1566785735.0,I feel this. I used to daydream about sleeping and I'd be so happy when it was time to go to bed. I even used to convince myself that I wouldn't wake up if I wished hard enough. Now it's sort of the opposite because I get insomnia because I dread having to wake up the next day. So it's sort of a lose-lose situation
Minecraft,ey04wjc,t3_cuvlib,1566674467.0,"It looks like a really cool gingerbread house, I love it! However, if you really want to take it to the next level, you should decorate it with candy and cake, and add an oven inside so you can lure villagers to your house and inevitably bake them in the furnace."

depression,exzc3am,t3_cupojh,1566663838.0,"I feel you. I have a pretty privileged life, but I just can't shake the feeling of depression off, and I feel like I just don't deserve to be depressed. But in reality, depression is not something you can control, and it not your fault that you feel depressed. It's kind of just this dark, looming presence, constantly following you.

Depression is a mental illness, it's not something you choose. Just think about all of the things you've been able to do while depressed. Even if it's just getting out of bed in the morning. Be proud of yourself."
depression,exzayx3,t3_cuqta6,1566663397.0,Yes. Like every night. I think insomnia is a pretty normal symptom of depression though.  It usually has to do with the anxiety of having to wake up and live another day in a state of depression.

Although I couldn't really laugh or clap as much as I wanted to because the theatre was pretty empty. I was honestly just really happy to finally see the show."
