Genealogy,fb95k3g,t1_fb91imn,1576629915.0,"i know ancestry world explorer allows you to search, but if you don’t have an account, i would suggest maybe looking at immigration papers or religious certificates showing exactly where in bulgaria they or their parents lived.

you could research the ottoman empire at that time and check if your local library or the federal/state government has any foreign records from there, 

check if the bulgarian government has any archive collection online, or maybe contact local authority in the area your ancestors lived.

hope this helps :)"
Genealogy,fb8isru,t3_ebye5o,1576614857.0,"i would research the ottoman empire itself or look into the land of present-day bulgaria within the ottoman empire, because chances are you won’t find any documents from “bulgaria” pre-1878.  

my ancestors are from poland and i had the same problem with poland being part of the german empire for a while pre-ww1.  

also try to look into census records or church records on sites such as ancestry or familysearch"
