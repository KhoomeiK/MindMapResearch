Outlander,fon7r6b,t1_fompzbl,1587914068.0,I can’t stop laughing from this comment 😂
GoogleAnalytics,fo77nr3,t1_ffxreci,1587573658.0,Hey there! Just wanted to follow up on this and see if you could tell me how to create this in GA :)
Outlander,fo4g03f,t1_fn8zryq,1587503735.0,Hahhahahah this made me laugh out loud  because I totally feel this :...D if I wasn’t married I would have “looking for my Jamie” on my profile 100%!!!!! I’m of Scottish decent so my dad has always made me learn about my Scottish heritage. I started learning Gaelic myself! It’s so cool! And I’ve lost my mind too. All I want to do is watch Outlander especially since we’re in quarantine!!!
Outlander,fo4fhd4,t1_fn8fmvi,1587503471.0,"Hahah you and I would be besties!!! I really need to start the books - I haven’t read any of them yet! Do you prefer the books, the show or do you enjoy both??"
Outlander,fo40sbl,t1_fn35be2,1587496235.0,You’re my hero!!!!  It’s just the best isn’t it 😊
Outlander,fo40pc5,t1_fn1l47k,1587496194.0,Omg that’s insane! Lol I don’t blame them though. I haven’t read the books yet but my friend tells me they are well worth the read! I love hearing the accents though! :)
Outlander,fo40j3b,t1_fn1b1pb,1587496109.0,Are you liking it the second time around?! I understood so much more after rewatching it!
Outlander,fo404mz,t1_fn117o6,1587495912.0,Love it! It’s been my saving grace during this quarantine! Hope you enjoy it again the second time around! 😊😊
Outlander,fo3zz1r,t1_fn2v9m3,1587495834.0,Right?!?  Omg it’s just so good I never want to stop watching it 😩
Outlander,fo3zv9i,t1_fn21p0b,1587495783.0,I’m right there with you girl 😂😂
Outlander,fn0ze7n,t1_fn0xz97,1586551731.0,Hahah omg it’s so worth it! It’s seriously my favorite show ever now! It’s really neat because you pick up on things you didn’t notice before. I’m glad I’m not alone though! 😂
CRM,fn0y9my,t1_fmkrlc2,1586551102.0,This is great! Thanks for sharing.
CRM,fn0y7tp,t1_fltqkyc,1586551074.0,"Zoho was on our short list. If you use it, I’d love to get your pro & con list of the CRM."
CRM,fn0y4x1,t1_fls190a,1586551028.0,Interesting! I haven’t looked into SuiteCRM before but will definitely check it out. Thanks for sharing!

CRM,fn0xzr2,t1_flrfnsq,1586550948.0,"My thought exactly. From the research I conducted, Salesforce seems to offer the best customer journey profile and is beneficial for  various departments/roles."
Outlander,fn0wgiy,t3_fxti7c,1586550092.0,I hope they continue on - I’m obsessed with the show!
MarketingAutomation,fi5imm0,t1_fi5goip,1582163948.0,I’ll definitely check it out! I haven’t heard of that one in particular. Thanks for the help :)
MarketingAutomation,fi5ik4c,t1_fhzr5vb,1582163904.0,"We are looking into nurturing leads, setting up a solid lead scoring module and being able to track the customer’s stages so we can see where people tend to drop off, or which medium seems to convert better. With that in mind, do you know of a better MA platform that will achieve these goals and connect with various CRMs? I’d love to hear your thoughts."
MarketingAutomation,fi5ihkt,t1_fi0cqzn,1582163861.0,Completely agree. I have yet to hear of a MA tool that doesn’t have its flaws :) would you be able to tell me how you go about using pardot and the successes of the platform? Would love your insight.
MarketingAutomation,fi5ibqa,t1_fi0gbqb,1582163760.0,"This comment was really insightful! Thank you so much for sharing with me. This definitely helps me with the decision making process for my company. We are looking for a MA tool that excels in nurturing leads, setting up a solid lead scoring module and tracking the customer’s stages so we can see where people tend to drop off, or which medium seems to convert. If you know of a different MA platform that will achieve these goals & connect with various CRMs I’d love to hear your thoughts."
MarketingAutomation,fi5i16c,t1_fhztbk6,1582163577.0,"Thanks for the response! We are looking into nurturing leads, setting up a solid lead scoring module and being able to track the customer’s stages so we can see where people tend to drop off, or which medium seems to convert better.

MarketingAutomation,fi5g5wa,t1_fi06j13,1582162392.0,Very true. I looked up pricing and contacted SF for pricing :)
MarketingAutomation,fi5fvv1,t1_fi0biyd,1582162213.0,I’ve heard this repeatedly from fellow marketers. Do you think Pardot is better at fulfilling on nurture campaigns & lead scoring compared to HubSpot?
MarketingAutomation,fi5fls1,t1_fi0j1zl,1582162031.0,My thought exactly; thanks for your suggestion :)
MarketingAutomation,fi5fk0m,t1_fhzudcf,1582161999.0,"Hey there! I really appreciate your answer. We were looking at Marketo, as well. I would love to hear how you personally connect Marketo and Salesforce together and the intricacies Marketo has to offer :) thanks again for the response!"

Anxiety,fc5hfaz,t1_eu70omo,1577457678.0,"I do the same. It sneaks up on me when I’m in client meetings, so I’m trying to find a way to control it. A sweater is a good idea - I’ve just let it show which makes me even more anxious lol. Thanks for sharing these tips :)"
programmatic,fc5h7so,t1_fbj28et,1577457510.0,"This is perfect. I am so glad you shared this with me. I tried it this way and apparently it worked. Thank you so much :)

It’s also good to know that the impression tracking isn’t as useful anymore. I’ll have to bring it up to my coworkers and see how we want to go about TrueView marketing in the future."
programmatic,fc5h07e,t1_fbigzlx,1577457341.0,This definitely helped. I appreciate you sharing this with me!

funny,eztj09u,t3_d21gwh,1568131455.0,I go into work every morning with a migraine because of Atlanta traffic! We definitely need a better public transportation system.
funny,eztiwo2,t1_ezsmrzx,1568131387.0,TBH I’m glad it moved. One of my friends was mugged and gunned down at the old stadium. At least it’s safer at the new location and we now have the battery.
rarepuppers,eum5bao,t3_cgty9i,1563911439.0,I have these glasses from Warby Parker 😂
Anxiety,eu6paw6,t3_ceu91n,1563505618.0,Yes!!! I used to do this all the time especially when I was younger. I’ve tried to stop myself from saying it as often!!
