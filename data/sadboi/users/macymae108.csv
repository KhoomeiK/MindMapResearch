AskWomen,eto3fsg,t3_ccir2g,1563011633.0,"That you should question everything. ESPECIALLY the thoughts you have about yourself. So when I think I’m responsible for something bad that happened, ask why don’t feel that way, and would I say or agree with that statement if it was my best friend or a loved one saying it? I find that putting a loved one in my situation and pretending they are saying the things im saying helps because It puta things in perspective for me."
confessions,eto37vl,t3_ccbihn,1563011284.0,"I totally feel this. I have tons of “friends” that I would hang out with or text or talk to for different purposes...some I talk to about serious things, some I talk to about funny memes I see and when we get together we have tons of fun, some I talk to every few months or even once a year but it feels like we have talked every day because we are just so open with each other. 

All people are different and so are relationships. A person can be your closest friend but you might not be theirs and that sometimes hurts but you sometimes have to realize that your relationships do serve a primary purpose which is to help you - whether that’s helping you through a tough time or helping you relax and have a good time. 

And most of the time you care enough about the person to be there for them and make sure they benefit from your relationship (whether you realize it or not)."

bipolar,eq8ooan,t3_bxnw4l,1559870985.0,"I started out on 75 mg seroquel at night and I was SO drowsy in the mornings and couldn’t get out of bed. Like I would snooze and turn off my alarms and then wake up not even remembering turning off my alarms. I went down to 25 mg a night and that’s enough that I can fall asleep (which before I couldn’t do with my racing mind) and wake up in the am and not feel like I need to stay in bed. 

I also take 100 mg of Zoloft a day and I can tell the difference. If I skip it for a day or two I get super emotional and tired and spacey. I really didn’t notice weight gain or any other side effects, although I’m fully cognizant of the fact that others have. 

Just my experience and I hope this combo works for you - I’m happy you’re taking steps for yourself!"
