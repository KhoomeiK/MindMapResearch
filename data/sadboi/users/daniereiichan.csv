Points included in the guidance for reopening restaurants include a strict regimen of cleaning and disinfecting areas, placing a priority on outdoor seating with proper social distancing protocols observed and initiating symptom screenings and temperature checks for employees.

However, places that primarily sell alcohol such as bars and pubs should remain closed unless they also offer indoor dining. ""Alcohol can only be sold in the same transaction as a meal,"" the state guidelines read.""
