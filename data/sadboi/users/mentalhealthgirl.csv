blackladies,ew81jt0,t1_ew815nh,1565201473.0,"You’re right, you definitely do not have to address it. I was just wondering if you had and what her response was. Yes, there is a shortage of black psychiatrists unfortunately but at the same time, you should have access to a competent doctor regardless of race. This woman sounds like she either didn’t get adequate training, has racial bias or both. I hope you get the help you deserve."
blackladies,ew8174o,t1_ew7wwyc,1565201269.0,"Thank you for sharing. Yes, DBT can be really expensive but it it great for BPD. Have you searched therapists in your area on Psychology Today? There you can see if there are any black therapists in your area or at least see if there are any therapists who are knowledgeable about inter generational family trauma. I think race based trauma and anxiety is something I want to help educate others on."
blackladies,ew80w8y,t1_ew7f41r,1565201095.0,"She sounds like a bad psychiatrist. I’m wondering if you have any access to finding a black psychiatrist in your area? Or, I’m also curious if you have addressed how you feel with her or if you would feel comfortable to?"

blackladies,ew7f084,t1_ew7dmmj,1565190839.0,That’s terrible! I’m sorry for your experience. I’m wondering is your psychiatrist is black or at least multiculturally competent?
blackladies,ew6l0n6,t1_ew67xsk,1565174533.0,Thank you so much for sharing! I have noticed that black people seem to deny or shut down when talking about mental health. Wonder why that could be...?
depression,ew1w6k6,t3_cmcier,1565032809.0,"Do you have any PTO? I suggest using them. You do not need to state a reason for taking your days just say you are using PTO today... that simple. Not everyone needs to know you have depression. Just like if you were throwing up all over the floor- they don’t need to know that either. Also, how are you taking care of yourself on your off days/weekends? Do you go see a therapist? Do you spend time with your friends/family? Participate in your favorite hobbies? Make sure you are using healthy coping skills to manage your symptoms."
mentalhealth,ew133jn,t3_cmamum,1565013929.0,"That’s mostly because what a therapist ‘prescribes’ is not a simple and easy fix. Doctors tell you to take this pill and your headache will go away. And if it doesn’t work, then you take another pill and so on. However, therapists don’t offer simple fixes. Therapists make you think and help you discover the solutions to your own problems. Those solutions are harder than simply swallowing a pill or your doctor being able to perform surgery. It is up to you what you do with your time in session with your therapist and what you do after you leave your session with the information you gained. Your therapist can not fix or cure you. That is not what they are for and I hope you don’t think that, which might be contributing to your disappointment. They are simply offer education based on your diagnosis, solutions that may be helpful in managing your symptoms, help you gain insight into your feelings and patterns, and help guide and support you in making the best choices for yourself. Also, good therapists never work harder than a client. Sometimes a client will never go home and apply anything they learn in session which makes the therapist come to the conclusion that the client is simply not ready to change or feel better. And you know what that’s okay! That is when a therapist just simply offers basic counseling phrases which is typically motivational interviewing to help encourage the client to feel motivated to change. Therapy only works if you are open to the process and willing to put in a lot of work."
mentalhealth,ew11ljs,t3_cmamum,1565012801.0,"Just curious, but if you are “done with therapy” and don’t think therapy is helpful... then why do you keep going back? I’m wondering if it’s easier for you to blame therapists for not miraculously  curing you rather than you taking any responsibility on helping yourself. Depression is a life long journey, you will never fully be cured. It comes in waves, sometimes it’s more difficult than other times. Therapists are either supposed to help you find coping skills to manage your symptoms or help you find the root cause to your depression and the best therapists help you with both. They are never supposed to tell you what to do or do some voodoo magic in one session, three months or a year and you will be cured! Therapists are only 50% of the healing process, the other hold comes from you. It may take time to find the right therapist that you feel comfortable with and that can truly help you because there are some really terrible therapists out there. But if you are finding yourself going from therapist to therapist and keep coming to the conclusion that it’s your therapists fault you’re not getting better, then again, I suggest you really reflect on whether you might be the one blocking your success in the process. Sometimes, people are more comfortable feeling depressed than getting better. It takes a lot of work and sometimes people are not ready for that.  Or maybe you need to research theoretical approaches that may help you and find a therapist who practices this approach. These are all just thoughts but I really hope you heal one day. Good luck!"
selfhelp,evzg9uk,t3_clwn8d,1564956869.0,"Never self diagnose yourself... watch YouTube videos that are related to how you are feeling. Katie Morton has a wide variety of info, she is a LMFT. I’ll also suggest journaling as a coping skill for your anxiety. Just write as much and as often as you can about what you’re feeling, thinking, experiencing, etc."

bwwm,evbwiew,t3_cingou,1564397876.0,"Take it off of your profile. When I was online dating and saw that, I would quickly swipe left. To me, that is saying that this white guy expects to me to act, talk, behave, think, have a specific cultural background or interests that he already has made up in his mind that all black women do. I could be wrong but that is what I think. It's like you are looking for any black woman, doesn't matter who and that does not make me feel special. If a black woman is interested in you, then you will match. Also, don't even mention that you are interested in BW over all else. Just let the relationship flow naturally without stating this preference."
bwwm,evbw9c6,t3_cizi8x,1564397551.0,"My question is, why did you not immediately run over to her to see what is making her upset? Why did you just sit or stand or wherever you were at the time and do nothing but watch? Why did you pause or hesitate? Also, how do you not know what an uncle tom is and you are married to a black woman? Do you guys never talk about racism and black people's history in America? This is quite concerning what happened and I suggest you deeply reflect on your behavior in this particular situation."
psychotherapy,erolwbj,t3_c2hjnp,1561082448.0,"I passed the NCE last year and I am confused about the certification. What exactly is this certification? Also, now that I passed it, am I automatically a national certified counselor? Or, do I need to still obtain post graduate hours that are required for the LPC? I never received a certificate in the mail stating that I passed the NCC, I just saw it online so I am confused. I was pressured to take this exam after graduating."
selfhelp,eqr6u8c,t3_bz50h3,1560251001.0,"You may be turning to people who do not have the answers, tools, skills, patience, understanding, and empathy to be there for you in the way you want them to. Friends are human and not perfect. They cannot be held to the same expectations as a qualified mental health counselor. It sounds like you may need to seek professional help and stop expecting too much from your friends because they can't and may not ever be able to give you what you are seeking. Look at Psychology Today and find a therapist in your area."

selfhelp,epn5870,t3_bv7aum,1559321608.0,"You only went once... therapists are not magicians. It takes a lot of work to accomplish whatever you sought out to get in therapy. Yes, you can talk to your friends and family about your 'deepest secrets'  or read self help books (both really good things to do in addition to therapy) but it sounds like it has not been giving you the specific answers you are looking for. That's almost like saying you broke your leg and your friend lent you their old crutches and you take pain medicine hoping that your leg will heal but are unsure about seeing a doctor because during the first visit, your leg wasn't magically healed with the snap of your doctors fingers. Also, yes, there is a lot of talking in therapy, that is why they call is 'talk therapy'. But what a lot of people do not realize is that they must take action towards their goals and aspirations. Utilize your resources such as qualified clinicians who are knowledgable about various mental health treatment recommendations to guide you towards the answers you are seeking to find. There are many different theoretical approaches to counseling, so with the brief information you provided, I suggest you find someone who practices existential theory , humanistic theory, or my personal favorite positive psychology. I understand, therapy is expensive, which is a whole other problem. But if you have access and the money to go, then lucky you."
helpmecope,epaoozn,t3_bu9tcs,1559131192.0,"Are you in therapy? That might be the first step. If not, I highly suggest you go to your local library and pick out depression workbooks and apply what it says step by step. 

Also, you don't have to go to a gym to exercise.... Step outside and go for a walk or pull up a youtube video. My favorites are fitness blender and fightmaster yoga.

No excuses, those are only a symptom of your depression."
