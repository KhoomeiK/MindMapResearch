stevenuniverse,fmflez1,t1_fmffyyf,1586029701.0,"This is especially supported by the glimpses of Homeworld we got in episodes like Familiar - statues, walls, combs, murals are all stationary, sentient gems that probably fall really low in the hierarchy. Essentially the same stuck-in-place association to them as plants and grass."
Anxiety,fm5t0ag,t3_ft3nko,1585779359.0,Thank you - I've been beating myself up all day wondering why I feel like I can't accomplish the bare minimum this week. I needed this.
stevenuniverse,fknzydu,t1_fkmldpq,1584377363.0,"You're absolutely right about all of that. I just meant, they did do their best, and it was their inexperienced parenting combined with a number of factors that led to this situation."
stevenuniverse,fkivdn0,t1_fkin97g,1584229538.0,"One interesting consideration is the assumed responsibility and capability of another child's parents and guardians. She didn't trust Steven to be a friend of Connie until she trusted the Gems as guardians; therefore, she probably viewed what she saw in Legs From Here to Homeworld as a supervised, diplomatic mission with responsible gems watching Steven and Connie at all times (Not one where Steven is separated from the gems immediately, watches the gems poof and fall, watches Connie swordfight Pearl, and watch WD take his gem).

Although I don't hold any of the Crystal Gems responsible for Steven's trauma, there were certainly a lot of situations that they never recovered from or helped Steven recover from. They were all having a hard time together; but in Dr. Maheswaran's perspective, just like in real life, we can assume that because everything looks like it's in order from a distance doesn't mean everything is going well. Unless we keep an eye out, we may not notice a traumatized child until their brain starts reacting to stress like Steven now."
stevenuniverse,fjxz7jj,t1_fjxyoc4,1583686653.0,"Yeah! It definitely seems like he's going to successfully float to her, until she looks at him and breaks his concentration and mood, and he starts to fall."
stevenuniverse,fjwxw10,t3_ff4apv,1583648929.0,"He gets it straight from Rose, right? She gets startled by Greg in We Need to Talk and the record player cuts to static.

Of course I think both of these scenes were just playing off of the trope of cutting to static for dramatic effect, but particularly in the Steven case I would agree that it's definitely a magic thing. Feels a lot like how we get a clue that Steven has floating powers in season one as well."
composer,fjfvpm1,t3_fd3lz7,1583301667.0,"Functionally and aesthetically I would say top. Sure, there's an argument for both, and I know you're thinking of the typical way of writing descending chromaticism when you write the bottom pattern, but it's less intuitive in the context of the measure. I see the B to A# as a recurring figure in this measure. B to Bb the second time, to me, says these two notes serve a different function than the first occurrence. Thankfully this is low risk and you won't run into any issues either way, it all comes down to preference."

stevenuniverse,ezkjoy0,t1_ezkekvm,1567961408.0,Just remember that Rebecca stated there's more stories to tell before and after the timeskip!
stevenuniverse,etcsy2y,t1_etcrmdh,1562691975.0,"Logistically, as well, who really knows how much they figured out about the new look of Steven at that point. They might also have wanted to not pick and choose a new look in CYM and have to commit to it during movie production."
stevenuniverse,ert563p,t1_ert3qc2,1561232737.0,Thanks for the pointer! That sounds great. (:
stevenuniverse,eqa41mr,t1_eq9plx3,1559924648.0,"You're right! It's right-side up on her chest. 

Since the trailer shows the rotating gem flipping between right-side up and up-side down, maybe something happens where she flips her gem around - just like Pink did, in a way!"
stevenuniverse,eo69umt,t3_bqomw8,1558314953.0,I really wonder how different it's going to be with Bismuth's remodel!
