depression,fc3bg6x,t3_efz4mm,1577386077.0,"Hi,

Let me start with, I hear you. I'm suffering from clinical depression and while I have my own reservations about therapists, it's their job to listen. When I can't talk to my SO, I walk myself into my therapists office if they're open. They are bound by law not to share what you talk to them about, there's no risk in talking to them. At least in my 24 years there hasn't been. It's a little scary when you have to switch therapists if you move but having the unbiased opinion is like looking from the outside in. They catch things we might've missed even if we've mulled it over a million times over.

Just food for thought :) PM me if you ever need someone to talk to."

I don't know why it's bad to want to believe in the best of people. I don't know why it is bad to want to get sexual experience and then get judged for it. How are people supposed to learn what they do or don't like if they don't explore and learn? How can they be open about sex when we as a species shame others on it? Or even shame one another for gaining experience with something they enjoy?

Who am I to tell him what is too much or too little before he is a ""hoe"" or a ""slut,"" when it wasn't a part of our relationship? What matters now is the fact that he is committed to me, despite those past relationships failing, and that he was honest about his past doings.

Not everyone is a ""sex only in a relationship"" kind of person. But if you really can't look passed a detail like that, tell her now before you hurt her.
