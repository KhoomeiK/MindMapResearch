Please do not go back to him right now. Please at least do a trial separation, long enough for you to get in to talk to a secular individual therapist. You need an outside person to help you, and its genuinely scary that hes trying to bully you into speaking only to the family friend.

Everything hes doing has the warning signs of future abuse, of separating you from your family. I guarantee your mom is terrified for you right now.

Please reach out to me if you need someone to talk to. I'll be praying for you!"
JustNoSO,fdlw9de,t1_fdkt9bw,1578534015.0,"It also sounds like you're trying to control HOW he quits, OP, with your calling him a moron for ""believing weaning works.""

Weaning DOES work for many people, as does using an ecig during the quitting process, as does patches.

It's also sort of bizarre to separate him telling you about the cig when he got it and him actually smoking it as two separate rules broken?

I say this with all gentleness.... I think you should look into couples counseling and potentially individual as well."
JustNoSO,fdlm033,t3_elvsyz,1578527048.0,"....is he literally willing to give LO cancer in order to not hurt mommy's feelings? Because second and third hand smoke DRASTICALLY increases a child's chances of getting cancer. This isn't just about the smell, it's a very real health hazard."

There is no such thing as a grandparent bond that happens in the first 2 weeks. That bond is purely the baby figuring out who its primary caregivers are, which she is not."

Shes literally putting her own selfish, lazy wants over the wellbeing of her daughter and any grandkids."

TrueUnpopularOpinion,fbyw87u,t3_e6mqr8,1577228019.0,"So you think it's good for kids to have no toys and have to watch their schoolmates talk about all the cool shit Santa brought them, all because their parents are poor? That's how you teach a generation of poor kids to hate themselves. 

Having worked for a state safety net program, I can tell you from first hand experience that the overwhelming majority of people receiving benefits are the working poor: people working jobs that either dont pay enough or restrict their hours to benefit the corporation. And a huge percentage of those people are in areas without bustling job markets, especially for unskilled, non college educated people.

Giving kids a little bit of happiness does not teach them to leech off the system. It teaches them that maybe they deserve to be treated like human beings too."
JUSTNOMIL,fbyuqb9,t3_ef412f,1577226854.0,Do you know for sure that she told the doctor it was for her? She may have lied and said it was for you. You need to call the doc asap.
JUSTNOMIL,fbyujn2,t3_ef5ksy,1577226709.0,"Shes abusing benzos. My ex partner had me fooled for 2 years that he had health issues before I figured out he was just taking massive amounts of benzos and that that was causing all of his symptoms- which all match up with your MILs. Even the car accident, which ironically was part of my tipping point too. You need to tell her you know, and that she needs treatment. And you need to make sure her doctor knows shes abusing the drugs he or she is prescribing."

**You have to get out. Now.**

Please believe me when I say that he is using bipolar disorder as a manipulation tactic, and it is not something you can switch on and off. He knew what he was doing, he chose to choke you out in front of your child.

He is also likely spying on you and may have installed software on your computer/phone to log your keystrokes, since he knows about messages you've sent that he shouldn't be able to.

**Please, RUN.**"

I wasn't diagnosed until my late 20s (in my early 30s now) and I can remember struggling to figure out what feelings were valid in the aftermath of my diagnosis, because I was so afraid that I'd accidentally use it as a crutch."
