askphilosophy,fa7vhm3,t3_e7z41e,1575838608.0,"Sounds really interesting. My initial diss ideas was very similar, except about Camus rather than Sartre. However, I was steered away from this topic by my supervisor as he felt that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to *academically* prove something as immaterial as the 'influence' something like WWII had on their work.  So that is something to consider/reconsider. I think we both know that, without doubt, the war definitely had an influence on Sartre's work, however as I said, it's going to be very hard to quantify it in academic terms, and given a dissertation is a highly scrutinised piece of academic work it seems sensible to think about another option. ALTHOUGH, having said that, you are writing from an historical pov whereas I was writing mine from a philosophical pov, so that may also alter what is acceptable/suitable for your diss!"

I'm a natural worrier which usually manifests in me becoming anxious and nervous about what may happen in the future which often creates a self-fulfilling prophecy (not getting an erection during sex etc.). Teaming this up with abstaining from porn and masturbation can have a huge positive effect on things like PIED and delayed ejaculation."

I don't really have many triggers, I tend to relapse whenever I get random mental images of porn I have watched recently etc. When I get urges I do my best to snap out of it and move quickly onto something else like getting a glass of water or doing 10 push ups. The one positive thing I try to remember is that despite my relapses these past few days I still managed to get an erection earlier from thinking of having sex with my girlfriend, which I guess shows that my relapses haven't completely undone my hard work up to this point. So that is providing me with some much needed motivation and confidence."

Fitness,f70b01x,t3_dtq2p5,1573326397.0,"Your legs also get little to no genuine rest, unless you workout directly before going to bed. Whereas the upper body gets a lot of rest. Think about it: your legs have to be used for walking and supporting your weight while standing - you're going to be doing those two things quite a bit during the day, even if you have a seated job. Clearly these tasks aren't nearly as demanding as the leg session itself, but it's still a lot more work than our upper body does when we're not lifting. So it's natural to assume that the recovery process for legs is a little longer than required for upper body lifting."
Camus,f6q2abv,t3_ds7phn,1573069446.0,Probably just how much there is to learn about him and his philosophy.
