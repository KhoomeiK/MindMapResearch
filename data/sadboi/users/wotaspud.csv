Mythology compels her to
Kali her way out, indiscriminately stabbing
Pustules and buboes of bad times, bad turns.
Anything can be survived, barring the slow ignorant fester 
of reality changing incrementally 
until her temple is a living hell.
Gearing up she is a goddess, avenging morals and all sorts 
you wouldn't believe.  At the end it's all scrapes and bruises, 
and wonder at what she's done. Though it never helps, 
she pays her penance religiously."

The good thing about deleting is that, if you need to find any of your old comments or posts, you can still find them by searching your username on 

redditsearch (dot) io

Even if you've deleted them or deleted your account.  But won't have the ongoing temptation to keep browsing aimlessly.

Good luck!"

In my experience, the only time I would get like this is when my issues were dismissed with 'it shouldn't be an issue' and I felt like I had no way to express myself, be heard and cared for etc, so just shut down.

I think you need to have a very honest and vulnerable conversation.  Maybe there's something she'd like you to work on. 

Failing that just try to seduce her using the whole spectrum of sexuality/kink, see if anything gets her going.  She might be very shy about what she likes.  Tell her you want to blow her mind..thats pretty much irresistible lol.  It's a shame to separate if you're still in love with her and it might be fixable."

Also that his problems are more than likely social in nature, and not related to his intelligence (in any case even stupid people have relationships).

Sounds like OP is getting his dick wet just fine with sex workers but he wants a relationship.  Good.  So he's going to have to try a different approach as he's 29 and nothing has worked so far.  So improve on what he's lacking on (social skills, it sounds like).  Maybe drugs would give him enough fake confidence to get over the initial social hurdles?

Also maybe he'll have to lower his standards a bit, maybe find someone who has similar struggles to himself.
