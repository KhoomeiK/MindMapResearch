[there is a nasty channel who is under fire for doing this](https://twitter.com/protect_km/status/1255249267301761024?s=20), making ""analysis"" videos of taekook. and its legit scary to me that she has so many followers who blindly support that ship. so much of her followers believe that Bighit is a homophobic company who doesnt allow taekook to make out on camera, and a lot of new fans hate jimin because that channel keeps mentioning he is a cockblock or sumn."
