bipolar2,fppc1zx,t3_ged2cy,1588799564.0,"I’m also new (diagnosed less than a year ago) and now that I’m stable I find myself wondering this sometimes. 

My advice-don’t think about forever, that’s too overwhelming and not something that you can control. 

If meds help then use those, if ever you can manage without meds you need to be in the best possible place. You need great habits/routine, you need balance, you need support, you need your other autoimmune to be settled/managed, you need coping strategies. There’s a lot of scaffolding that needs to be ‘built’. Find a med that works well and can help you set that up for yourself, wait until you are feeling the best you have ever been and long term stable. Cross that bridge when you come to it-do what you need to do to be well now. 

In terms of meds it might not be lamotrigine and that’s ok, different meds for different people. Personally I have had great success on lamotrigine and latuda, doing better than I ever have and more stable than I felt was ever possible without meds (despite all that’s going on in the world). 

And go easy on yourself and take your time-it’s a big thing to process and what you are feeling is 100% normal."
ADHD,fppai3k,t1_fpo4h2m,1588798777.0,I reckon parenting is one of the hardest things to do when adhd. Personally I think it’s one of the things that pushed me to get a diagnosis. The sheer level of ‘details’ and mental load is so overwhelming.

bipolar2,fpp8l5j,t1_fpohk8d,1588797829.0,"Would your psych consider non stims like clonidine or straterra? Clonidine is also good for anxiety and sleep. I use both of those as well as Ritalin and they do really help, not as much as Ritalin but they give me a much better baseline and clearer thinking with less anxiety."
bipolar2,fpnsu96,t3_ge71or,1588771846.0,"I was diagnosed last year with both at the same time. In fact my adhd and subsequently anxiety was so out of control that when I saw my dr to be referred to a psych for adhd they also offered me an SSRI to help. You can all guess how well that worked, had a bit of a breakdown and was diagnosed with both. Had to stabilize the BP first,  was put on a non stimulant adhd med with  mood stabilizer and AP,  fortunately for me was straight forward. Then I started Ritalin 7 weeks later, definitely would not want to be on stimulants only with BP. Provided that mood is managed and the safety of a mood stabilizer and an AP my psych says he rarely sees issues with stimulants for his patients.  

How to tell? It’s what else is going on alongside the impulsivity and if the intensity keeps increasing it’s likely hypo. So if as well as impulsivity there are my some of my Hypo symptoms and it feels a bit ‘out of control’ Then it’s hypo. Symptoms for me when hypo- great mood, euphoria, colours are brighter, everything is beautiful (like a low dose of shrooms) feeling reckless or restless, cleaning, making plans to buy a dog, late to bed and waking up early (and feeling fine). Deciding I might become an erotic fiction writer or coming up with new business ideas. I start 15 random messenger chats cos I just feel like socializing. Trip over my own words, flight of ideas, word vomit. Then it’s escalates until I’m shitty and strung out.

Adhd, procrastination, can’t manage time (not for lack of trying-unlike when I’m hypo I just don’t really care). Still do impulsive shit but it’s like buying extra groceries instead of buying stuff I don’t need. Going to bed late late but still feeling tired and sleeping in to catch on sleep  in if I can. 

 Still want to buy a dog but I’ll talk about instead of just trying to find one I can buy RIGHT NOW! Still will probably dye my hair wacky colours but it’s an impulse not a compulsion if that makes sense? 

With adhd I do dumb stuff because I don’t think it through, hypo I’m compelled to and it’s ‘urgent’. 

Still talk heaps but i stay more on track, I knowwhen I was being annoying. 

It’s subtle differences but once you get to know your own ‘hypo’ signs it’s easier.  Adhd is a constant, hypo is cyclical and builds to a ‘crash and burn’ 

Meds: lamatical, latuda, Ritalin. Clonidine, straterra...have also just been prescribed gabapentin for sleep."

But it’s been really good, much more stable. Other people have noticed that I’m more focused and decisive, assertive in meetings, keeping other people on track etc, 
So I’d definitely say it’s working. Does make my cycle longer and cramps worse. Definitely dehydrating too, oh and I get sweaty more on it. Especially if I drink coffee-I can get super jittery and agitated if I have caffeinated coffee too close to taking my straterra/Ritalin.

Life at our house- very chaotic at times, we all lose the plot without structure and routine. Unregulated emotions everywhere, a lot of yelling at times which can be hard. In terms of the two of us we are best friends, mostly share in each other’s passing hyper focus interests, find other people incredibly boring, we are both endurance athletes who are stubborn and love pushing ourselves to our limits, we need the pressure of a deadline to get anything done. I love that we have both changed so much over the time we’ve been together. 
We both are sensitive and blame ourselves for things and hate conflict- that can sometimes cause problems. We both sometimes neglect each other for our latest obsessions, we both find parenting and all the mundane details incredibly challenging as well as the constant demands and noise levels because we both get overwhelmed easily. 

I leave cupboards open and stuff out, he forgets to buy the only thing he went to the shop for. I’m always late and he struggles a bit with that too. He hates buying presents and replying to text messages, I hate putting fuel in the car 🤣🤣😂😂

ADHD,fmej5e5,t1_fmej3ik,1586005578.0,Sorry these are Victoria psychiatrists I think I read your ‘Australia’ as Victoria lol.
ADHD,fmej3ik,t3_fusbzt,1586005532.0,"Hi there, you just need a referral from your gp to a psychiatrist (you can specify the psychiatrist you want to be referred to) . You can take the screening tool in with you or your go can supply for you to complete. You can describe your symptoms and what your gp needs to know to be able to refer is that your symptoms have always been present. Once you get a referral you call the psychiatrists office and book your appt. you may have to pay to secure your booking. You do get some back from Medicare if your psychiatrist doesn’t bulk bill but I think pay about 150 per appt out of pocket. 
It’s bit true what your dr told you, you do not need private health to see a psychiatrist. There is bulk bill options too, but most of will be private practices (ie you pay an out of pocket gap fee) 

 It can be any psychiatrist but truthfully a lot don’t understand it and are not effective at medicating it. I would recommend seeing someone experienced/specializing in adhd for a better experience. I had a friend who realised at the same time that he had adhd symptoms, we both got referrals done, mine I had to wait two months to see a specialist and his the local bulk bill who would see him almost straight away. 8 months later We’ve had such different experiences with my adhd now medicated and managed (despite also being diagnosed with bipolar and working out meds for that) And he is still stuck battling his psychiatrist who is insistent on keeping him on a low dose and tries to give him anti depressants, he’s asked so many times to adjust dosages to manage symptoms and is getting no where  (even though he was diagnosed before me). 

So I highly recommend seeing someone good even if it takes longer to get in with them. In my experience they have a whole different approach whereas some psychiatrists don’t really understand and almost buy into the stigma that surrounds adhd. 

My psychiatrist isn’t taking new patients but when I’ve asked him for my friend he recommended dr Jaya reddy (had a different friend see him for her adult diagnosis and he was very good, very straightforward process) 

A different friend of mine recommends cognicare in Richmond, Dr Joel Aizenstros."

bipolar,fmcm9f1,t3_fueqpl,1585948394.0,"My initial referral for a psych was because I suspected ADHD, my pdoc was the one that suspected BP and I thought he was being ridiculous. Same pdoc then prescribed my SSRI’s and hello manic episode, I very much do have BP.
Was a bit of a wait to see my psych and he specializes in adhd and was clear that he believed I had both particularly as my adhd symptoms were across all moods. In fact I’m probably more productive in a manic episode which kind of masks it.

So his approach was to treat and get BP under control first then look at stimulant meds. So I started on latuda 65mg lamatical 100mg and clonidine (100mg) for 8 weeks before we considered treating the adhd. My mood was better than it had ever been and it did really help with everything but still the adhd symptoms were there, especially at work. 
He said Ritalin has lower risk of psychosis as a side effect so we’d start on that, it’s been great! No mania at all and has improved my symptoms so much. The only thing is that because my other meds (particularly the AP) slow me down so much I needed quite high dose of Ritalin to really work and I wasn’t getting coverage, so I am also now on straterra. So I’m on a lot of meds  now but  definitely manages symptoms for both. My anxiety decreased a lot with the adhd treatment and the straterra has been good for that too. 

I think make some notes of your symptoms and emphasize  to your psych that it’s present all the time (if that’s the case) And be open to different kind of treatment, sometimes psychs don’t like when you ask for a specific adhd med. but be open that you’ve tried it and that it works for you- tell him what symptoms are controlled by it. 
A lot of the symptoms overlap so it can be really hard to differentiate, but the key thing they’ll want for a adhd diagnosis is that it’s been present since childhood not  only appearing since onset of BP. Maybe take a look at old school reports or ask your parents about how you were as a kid/at school."

Bear in mind with your combo of meds you may also need an antipsychotic to help stabilize, especially since your staying on the celexa. (I’m also quite sensitive to meds and lamotrigine on it’s own even at 25mg-50mg a day was a bit of an ‘upper’ without pairing it with a antipsychotic)

But best way to describe it is that my BP/PTSD are a lot related to moods and my adhd can affect my emotions but also my focus and executions function hugely. Even when my mood is good. For example when I’m super depressed I hate cleaning, it’s all too much. When I’m manic I’m obsessed with cleaning and rage at anyone who makes a mess. When I’m stable and unmediated for adhd I don’t notice the mess and I leave piles of stuff everywhere. When medicated I can clean up after myself and it’s easier to do it. But I can still leave it unfinished and not freak out.  

I will say though having my BP treated and stabilized first made a huge difference to how tolerable my adhd symptoms are. Be worth asking your dr about it, it’s isn’t uncommon to have both. Some drs are cautious to prescribe stims but there are also non stimulant meds as options."

bipolar2,ff8tw04,t1_ff7y28j,1579695910.0,"I know what you mean and I think it’s a very normal part of being diagnosed later in life. Drs love to give a label/ diagnosis so they can solve a problem. But try not to see it as a problem that needs fixing or a label that limits or defines you. Try to see it as a lens to understand yourself and why you are the way you are. See it as a way to frame your struggles and know that the diagnosis/label becomes the ‘ticket’ for you to access the help you need. 
You are still you, nothing about your life has changed. But perhaps you can be even more you now you have a new way to understand yourself. For me accepting the diagnosis means some self forgiveness and more acceptance for the things that I couldn’t control but felt like I was supposed to be able to do.

bipolar2,ff2ax80,t1_fet8fm6,1579499114.0,"Just want to say that BP2 can be quite subtle. I doubt I ever would have been diagnosed if not for an SSRI sending me off the planet a bit. I was given lexapro for anxiety. 
And yes compared to your BP1 friend, it’s likely that your symptoms could look very different.  In some ways I doubted my diagnosis but in others it’s Almost laughable that I took the burden of it and just thought I was a shitty person for so long. 
hypomania can be subtle, it can look like anxiety, it can look like productivity, it can look like self care-especially after period of depression. Especially at the start of my hypomanic state people think I’m awesome and they love it, then they get tired of me lol.

If you’re not sure why your dr diagnosed then definitely ask more, they can usually spot common signs and symptoms easily and they don’t always tell you what they are. It’s easy to spot once you know what to look for. My pdoc could tell from one conversation with me.

I’d say give it a go and see what happens, knowing that lamatical can be quite effective generally for depression/ptsd type stuff anyway so it’s unlikely to be harmful, it’s not as strong as an antipsychotic. 
For me the low dose SSRI messed me up, lamatical has barely any side effective other than feeling better and more stable than I have in years."

Check this out but if you google dsm adult adhd screening tool it will give you some idea, it’s not a diagnosis but can point your doctor in the direction for further investigation, and diagnosis can be made off a paper based test combined with history or some people get a neurological Test.

ADHD,fdsfd2e,t1_fdqhq3n,1578701474.0,"Yeah the LA is weird, it’s like it just does so much less but weirdly I find it easier to feel “tweaked out” on it when it hits its ‘peak’ after 2 hours or whatever, could all be in the way we metabolize it, given that it’s a slow release. Another poster here has posted some great diagrams that breakdown the average windows of time of effectiveness and the medication ‘peaks’ for IR, LA and the extended release and that’s quite an interesting read. So try searching that in the search bar to see if you can find it.

But in answer to your question RE dosage  I’m on much higher doses. I should note though that I’m also on a mood stabilizer and antipsychotic for my bipolar (both have the side effects of sedation and cognitive slowness/bad memory) and I’m on clonidine for adhd/sleep (which brings heart rate down and makes you more ‘chill’) so I suspect that’s why I need a much higher dose and why I don’t get the intolerable side effects that many get. (Plus I have three young kids and work full time so I have to be functioning at a high level across 16-18 hours per day) 

So my dr and I are still playing around a bit with the dosage but here’s what it looks like 

Early AM: 5 or 6 x 10mg IR

Lunchtime: 2 x 30mg LA + 2 x 10mgIR

Late afternoon or early PM 1 x 30mg LA + 2 x 10mg IR

Often my other choice is 

Early AM: 5-6 x 10mg IR

Lunchtime: 5-6 x 10mg IR

Late afternoon early PM: 1 x LA + 3 IR. 

Just depends what kind of focus I need. So don’t freak out it’ll sound like huge doses but my dr doesn’t take a conservative approach as he specializes in adhd in adults. Plus I really don’t have any negative side effects, resting heartrate of low to mid 50’s and great blood pressure."
bipolar2,fdsdzk3,t3_emu3bd,1578700500.0,"I’m newly diagnosed (less than 3 months) but for me so far:

1. Take your meds, more importantly keep talking to your dr, if there’s any side effects that are likely to make you non compliant find a new med or work with your dr on dosage/timing to get it right. Also there might be times when you need to change dosage depending on your environment. Keep talking- this will make it easier. 

2. Routine- my bloody kryptonite, my whole life I’ve hated routine but I need it so much (for both my adhd & BP). Go to bed and wake up at the same time everyday, take your meds at regular times, exercise regularly. And you might need to be proactive in managing tht which is tough. My mood was out of control over the holidays because I was all out of routine and it really affected me, looking back I realised this has always been the case. 

3. Support- have a few people who know what’s happening for you, so they can check in and you can 100% be honest with them and ask if they can help identify mania triggers and tell you if the see them, they are also great people to help you identify when you are ‘baseline’. I’ve noticed my ability to regulate and accurately assess my moods is very poor, eg I think I’m fine but really I’m very agitated and taking it out on everyone. 

And if you can having someone else in your life with BP that you connect with, talk shop about meds, laugh about crazy stuff we come up with like how you want to create a start up business and become an erotic writer etc 
Note- these people are also very very good at spotting mania in others, my great BP friend who has been diagnosed and managing successfully for a lot longer than me is great at seeing my mania and checking in on how I’m managing it without being confrontational and I love that. 

MOST IMPORTANTLY-Keep being your badass self, it’s all you- the ups and the downs and everything in between. It doesn’t take anything from you and it isn’t a life sentence, this diagnosis is a way to label the way your brain works and gives you an insight into how to manage it. Your diagnosis is not you trying to get attentions, it’s not an excuse  And you aren’t ‘making it up’, it’s your ‘Ticket’ to hopefully getting the right meds and support you need!"
