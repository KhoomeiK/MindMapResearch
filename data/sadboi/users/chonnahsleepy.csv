bigboobproblems,fr2zawc,t1_fr2wzt7,1589846807.0,Thank you for the advice! I'll try cross posting on abtf :)))
bigboobproblems,fr2z7e2,t1_fr2mlcy,1589846752.0,"Hi, thank you so so much for the detailed and thoughtful response! This helped me so much!   
 I'm a broke college student so the brands you mentioned sadly are way outta my budget :(. I tried the syrokan one cause it resembles the panache underwire sports bra that I can't afford haha.   
 My makeshift underwired sports bra that was intended for daily use, although I have to keep adjusting (pulling) the straps up, is quite tight but I could still breathe contained my boobs and didn't give me upper back pain.   

I noticed my boobs bounced more when I used the syrokan one (twice as of today) and the back pain started then too :(. I take it to mean even if the my sizing was correct in the bra size, it still wouldn't contain my chest and prevent back pain as it's probably not made for high impact workouts, only moderate Impact at best.   

Sighs, i guess I'll try looking for more sports bras that I could get shipped from China since I'm from Malaysia and that's usually where I get my stuffs haha. The other options are to hold my boobs when I do high impact exercises whenever possible or switch to high intensity low impact / no jumping workouts as I saw other users posted on a few threads back.   

I'm really starting to quite enjoy running but absolutely dread the back and boob pain. I'm also quite scared of sagging boobs since I'm only in my early 20s and they sag enough as they are compared to people my age. It's not common for an Asian to have breasts as large as mine so we don't really have brands that cater to this niche market except maybe Wacoal haha.   

btw what are sister sizes? I know that when you go up a cup size you go down a band size and vice versa and I've seen the word sister sizes thrown around here.   

Again, thank you so, so much for taking time out of your day to respond to my anxious enquiries!"
bigboobproblems,fr227ya,t1_fr0lmau,1589829895.0,"Hi! Thank you so much for replying. I'm so sorry I was so incoherent and vague, English is not my first language. I'll try and be more succinct this time.    

Here are my measurements I've taken according to the abtf guide:    

Loose Underbust 81cm.  
Snug Underbust 77.5cm.  
Tight Underbust 73cm  
Standing bust 92cm.  
Leaning bust 100cm.  
Lying bust 97cm.  


I've already measured my size and its a UK 32E according to the abtf calculator. I was a 32G 4 years ago when I measured but lost weight.   

Yup, the seller didn't know much haha, the product is called syrokan high impact support sports underwire bra in A200. It's a convertible racerback.   

Problem 1: my boobs spill on the sides.    

Problem 2: the strap feels very tight and uncomfortable and dig into my shoulders when I converted it to a racerback and used it for its intended purpose - high impact exercises like running.    

Question 1: Are sports bras supposed to be tight and feel uncomfortable for it to support your beasts during exercise? How tight is too tight? Should I feel extremely comfortable when I have the right-sized high impact good support sports bra?    

Question 2: if my boobs spill on the sides and the strap feels tight, what does it indicate? 

With this syrokan sports bra, my boobs still jiggled and bounced and I bought this sports bra hoping it would contain my boobs and not have it bounce *at all*. So, I'm wondering if it's because i got the wrong size that my boobs still jiggle and bounce.    

I hope I'm clearer this time, I'm really sorry if I was still all over the place, I hope I got my points across. Thank you once again!"
BPD,fr0bf1j,t1_fqu1qfv,1589789755.0,"I see, I guess I don't really know how that really, really works since I just ignore my toxic family members to preserve my sanity and I don't split on my friends.... I mostly split on myself...."
BPD,fqsyz8d,t1_fqrp5kd,1589624088.0,"I agree with this. Give your passion to people who deserve it. I think we have to understand that very, very few people will reciprocate with the same breadth, width and intensity that we tend to shower on our loved ones, whether it be an fp, family, friends or significant others....  

That doesn't mean they don't appreciate it though, they do, they really do haha, they just don't know how to reciprocate it that feels true and valid to their own personality haha and how WE want them to express their gratitude whether in verbatim or through very, oddly specific reactions xD.   

Choose your poison I guess? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ We're gonna be intense nevertheless so might as well choose people who appreciate our intensity and maybe even learn from our ways to express themselves more (if they genuinely want to, of course!).   

Stay safe and healthy! We can do this. Our bpd doesn't define us. We are who we are and emotions and feelings are never wrong, it's just how we choose to roll with those feelings that show our emotional maturity :)"
BPD,fqsrw2m,t3_gkjgjv,1589616685.0,I'm so genuinely happy for you!
BPD,fq2ffgz,t1_fq1ocke,1589055620.0,"Omg wow I could never have put into words the behaviour I was exhibiting.... I was and still am terrified of people getting mad at me because of something I did or say... It's always a me me me mentality and it's never really about the other person and sometimes I still feel selfish.   

I recently told a friend about a secret of my close guy friend that he wouldn't want anyone to know, that he took years to open up and finally told me about, I felt angry and guilty because I was blaming the friend who I thought and still think passive aggressively tried to probe the secret outta me. I can't control what other people do but I could control my actions and I felt like I owe the probing friend a lot so I told him the secret.   

I feel so guilty and I've yet to tell my close guy friend that I divulged things he wouldn't want others to know about and I feel selfish because all I thought about was ""what if he doesn't wanna be friends with me anymore? What if he hates me and our 15 years of friendship go down the drain?"".    

It was all about me and very little about him and I kinda dislike myself quite a bit for thinking that back then and still....   

Wow that's a lot anyways I just wanna say thanks for writing down what you wrote because it's really comforting to know that I'm not the only one that struggles with these things. Stay safe and healthy :))"
dbtselfhelp,fq2diyz,t3_ge5x2i,1589055105.0,Thank you so much!! This is soo useful
BPD,fq29icp,t1_fq1n4y7,1589054047.0,"That's really cool of you to actually take time to impart and educate people here on the skills you learned through dbt! A lot of people including myself will definitely find it extremely useful. I'm definitely subscribing to the dbt subreddit because right now I can't see my therapist physically (phone sessions once a month) and I'm still doing talk therapy/cbt..... Ive yet to bring up dbt but I'll be sure to do it when I have my session with her this month :).   

Stay safe and sending you and everyone else lotsa love!"

BPD,fq24fhd,t1_fq0udgu,1589052737.0,"Yeah, after reading back it seems that I was in the wrong, op was just venting, I was wrong. I'll edit my comment."
BPD,fq244xw,t3_ggeroa,1589052656.0,"Haven't been on this sub for the past week or so but yeah....   

Being an empath is not that great tho tbh? I feel like sometimes you become an emotional sponge if you're not careful.... Also I felt really guilty a few weeks back because my best friend that never truly shows her shortcomings and tends to have her shit together just broke down to me crying cause she just broke up with her boyfriend.   

I was shocked for a bit at first and I teared up a bit when she broke down but then like a bolt outta the blue i just felt nothing. Absolutely nothing. Zilch. Nil. Nada. NOTHING. I don't know why but I felt no strong sadness or empathy... I think i just shut down. My fam & friends mean the world to me but I already struggle with intense emotions as is and I think as a form of protection I just....i just shut down.   

It's like a switch was flipped and I felt absolutely nothing and after the hours long convo I just felt so guilty because I felt nothing when she was crying after the first 5 mins......   

I don't know if this is what the so-called 'disassociation' is but I've never felt more shitty about myself that time.   

Light and love to everyone else.... It doesn't matter if you feel too much or maybe you feel nothing at all... As op said your feelings don't make you you. Your actions will dictate you.   

I don't think people really care about your feelings or thoughts or intention... Unless they're psychics the only thing that's tangible to them is your actions so let's try our hardest to manage our actions in respond to our overwhelming emotions :))).   

Stay safe everyone!"
BPD,fpzjwr6,t1_fpyq58r,1589019267.0,"Yes!!! Sooo true. I'm not a bad person, I'm empathetic and I'm really loving to my family and friends and that's regardless of my bpd. I don't agree with the op's doom and gloom mentality like another user mentioned....   

Who says pwbpd can't live fulfilling lives?"
BPD,fpzjimy,t3_gg4gkm,1589019108.0,"Op, I realize that you're just venting your frustrations out, although I don't agree with how you worded some of your sentences, you're probably just in a bad place mentally.   

I'm really sorry you feel the way that you feel. I hope that you're able to feel better again and hopefully get into therapy (although I know how hard it is for people to afford that even with insurance....).   

I'm sorry for my original comment that I hoped you hadn't read..... This is the only place that truly understands me and I think pwbpd should stand in solidarity and support of each other :).   

Sending you lotsa love! Stay safe op and everyone else!"

You're a really great friend for supporting. Being there for pwBPD especially in these times of uncertainties means the world! Tell your friend she'll be fine!"

I'm looking for a sports bra, I've been eyeing the panache sports bra, but am told to size down? How does that work? Also, what are sister sizes and how do I find mine?   

Thanks in advance, this sub has helped me a lot in terms of self confidence and bra fit! Thank you for everything that you guys contribute!"
Anxietyhelp,fo7h1z3,t1_fo4r2nw,1587578205.0,"Omg are you me like I KNOW there's people who love and care for me and I shouldn't self isolate cause I'd just feel worse and I'm scared they don't wanna talk to me at all really which is so stupid cause these people are family and like close friends who've been there through thick and thin.... Ahhh.. I guess I'm just getting anxious and scared and reverting back to when I felt invalidated, ignored and unloved for by an emotionally unavailable, distant and aloof dad and an incredibly reactive, explosive and emotional mother.....   

Plus I have a habit of liking guys who don't like me but occasionally show me like crumbs of attention and I literally just gobble it right up... Im lucky the first guy i ever told my feelings to is a genuinely nice guy but he doesn't like me and he doesn't respond as often now like we can't chat casually cause he's super busy with studies and starting yesterday I'M gonna be super busy with studies.   

The quarantine is really fucking me up. I don't know when all this will end and I'm honestly so freaking anxious I've been crying so much and just feeling very scared of eveyrthing and anything."
malaysia,fnyukzk,t3_g4punf,1587376236.0,"Promising news. So let's say we get released end of Mayish. Since there's no vaccines in place yet, we still have to practice social distancing and such. What will post-mco look like? Everything is so uncertain right now.   

Are schools gonna be conducted f2f or online? What about shopping malls, cafes, etc? I guess international and interstate travels will be banned. Life will never be the same again.   

I got a fright when unofficial sources said the quarantine will be till the end of the year. The first thing that came to mind was ""wow, can't believe my uni life is just gonna be like this at home...."" ugh. I know myself and a lot of people's mental health has been deteriorating. Getting resentful looking at loved ones too. Dang, everything is hard right now."
malaysia,fnys53h,t3_g4g7mz,1587373612.0,Can i have an exact date.... Some say till end of the year... Some say till end of june.... I highly doubt the gov's gonna let the people run loose cause that's just irresponsible..... This is a pandemic and no vaccine has been found yet.

BPD,fnemp39,t1_fnellxa,1586892108.0,"Yeah, i think its possible if you work on yourself and be lucky enough to find a supportive partner but i think taking care & focusing om ourselves is paramount.

BPD,fn9sqog,t1_fn9hgck,1586783618.0,"Say it louder for the people at the back sis!   

We already get a bad enough rep in the media and on the internet, i think we should practice compassion & empathy for each other. I mean, who else is gonna support us but ourselves & hopefully people who struggle through similar issues as us?   

My dr basically said to work on yourself. Take care of yourself. Eat healthy, exercise, have a self-care routine. Hobbies, the usual long-list of self-validating activities & tips thrown in abundance. Also, he said to do anonymously, like write songs, poems, blog etc whilst hiding your true identity especially from those around you.   

I guess it's a way to rewire your brain to feel a sense of high & accomplishment & validation in a more healthy way?? Idk hahaha but that's what he said and I've done some & yeah i guess it works but it's still early so i guess we to have wait & see haha.   

All the best."
BPD,fn9s1xo,t1_fn97r8y,1586783114.0,"I totally get what you're trying to say!! It's like a drug you're addicted to, these bpd behaviours. I'm lowkey avoiding someone cause I think i manipulated the person emotionally and feel extremely guilty even if it was something trivial. I find myself doing that sometimes when I'm upset & i hate myself & beat myself up over it every time. I catch myself doing it and stop immediately. It happens with strangers or people i barely know & thankfully i don't do it the people im close with - my family and close friends."

BPD,fn9qn3c,t1_fn7p2vx,1586782040.0,"Omg yes. After a crisis has past my doctor thinks I'm very sane and stable but like hindsight is always 20/20 & it's because I'm not consumed by my emotions and in an episode that I'm able to think & process everything in clarity.   

Can't do shit when I'm actually experiencing an episode. Like, you know what you're supposed to do & not do but meh logic & rationality just flings itself outta the window."
BPD,fn9pyj7,t1_fn9ojrm,1586781497.0,Yesss to drowning out the feeelssss. When my emotions feel intense and out of hand(which is very often haha) i just blast my fav music. Different genres but works just the same haha.

I'm so exhausted emotionally & mentally. Been feeling like crap and i hate these feelings so much. I just wanna be normal.   

On a positive note, it's nice to know I'm not alone. It really is the most reassuring thing knowing that you're not the only one who struggles with this fucked up personality disorder, haha."
BPD,fn9oqqx,t3_g0eogj,1586780470.0,"Yah i feel confident and beautiful one day, neutral the next and then the very next im insecure, screenshoting and stalking my fp's crush. I spent 7 hours going through her stuffs, screenshoting everything. I think i have more than a few loose screws in my head.   

I'm obsessed about the fps crush and i haven't replied to texts or scrolled through any of my social media. It's exhausting feeling like you're on top of the world and then down in the dumps the next day.    

I just wanna feel things like what normal people feels. I don't want all these emotions, all these feelings. I wish i didn't feel at all. I wish i could feel nothing. I honestly wish that. Life's been such a drag, what with the lockdown & I'm bored outta my mind but at the same time I'm Enjoying my alone time.   

At least i dont have to see people, don't have to gaf ive gained weight, if my hair is washed, don't have to to put on real clothes and i dont have to try & gauge everyone's feelings, read their expressions, watch what i say (impulsivity+brass personality for a girl is a recipe for disaster :D) and pretend to be energetic all the time, even when im slowly dessicating(?) inside.    

I hate people. I posted something on ig and honestly i only did that cause I wanted to get validated by people's comments and whatnot. I haven't checked since i posted cause i know after riding that high im gonna crash real hard so f that.   

Bpd sucks."
