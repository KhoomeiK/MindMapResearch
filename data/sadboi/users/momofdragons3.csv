But the adult in you wants to keep the boyfriend safe. I want to ask if he has been formally diagnosed as bipolar.  (Sorry- I dont know him, could he be on illegal drugs?) If he is bp he NEEDS to take medicine and cant get better without them.  So now what? You feel hopeless.  You feel stuck. Start moving.  Do some groundwork:  Talk to your family about moving in with them. Living together isn't working out so go back to dating. Find a place closer to town for boyfriend for more job/transportation options. Take him to a doctor to get a mood stabilizer and be the one to give him the pills.  Yes, he will resist and storm away. In a perfect world he'll realize that he needs the meds but I suspect this won't be the case.  But you tried and did all you could do so that minimizes the guilt.  (Mom voice- You cannot continue existing like this, Sweetie.  Yes, you love him and have time invested in each other, but do you want to hang around for 5 more years and still be in the same situation?  Move. Forward or backward it doesn't matter. He needs more help than you can give him and has refused what you offered multiple times. If you can't save him, you need to save yourself.  Go home to mom, get your head back on straight)"
