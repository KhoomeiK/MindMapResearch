I think the only way to come to a semi-not-fucked-solution is to put yourself in his shoes. 

Even if this was the biggest mistake of his life- if you‚Äôd made an equivalent mistake- would it benefit you if he understood, and supported you in going to the funeral?"

SuicideWatch,ezhokpv,t3_c34ko8,1567913525.0,"I don‚Äôt know if this matters. Or is even helpful. Please delete this if it isn‚Äôt. But. When someone decides to hate their self, hurt their self, kill their self etc. everything that follows is justification. At least, that‚Äôs my experience. 

I‚Äôm engaged. My fianc√© and I have 2 cats and a dog. It‚Äôs a very loving little family. But I decided a long time ago that I hate myself and I hate my life. And I try so hard to overcome that. But every little disagreement. Any time I get too cuddly with one of the cats and get scratched. Any time the pup pees on the carpet. I use it as proof that I don‚Äôt belong here and should just give up. And I know it‚Äôs irrational bullshit. But in that moment, there‚Äôs nothing you could do to convince me otherwise. 

It hurts me more than anything that my fianc√© fell in love with someone like me. It feels like I‚Äôve cursed him. But at the same time, his love means so much to me. And I‚Äôm sure she felt the same about you. 

Please hang in there."

TalesFromRetail,eylxzmt,t3_cw3e0k,1567194708.0,"I worked at a clothing stores for 5 years. One week we were doing a sale where all of our jeans were $20. Karen comes up to the counter with a $70 pair of khakis with moto-style stitching and absolutely loses her shit when they don't ring up on sale. My manager pointed out to her that khakis aren't jeans, and she screamed at her for 10 minutes saying the sale is misleading, and ""what do you mean these don't count as jeans, why can't I have them at the sale price?!?!"" My manager finally lost it, slammed her hands on the counter and just said ""Ma'am, they aren't DENIM. THEY ARE NOT JEANS."""
JUSTNOMIL,ex3l0h4,t1_ex3dwo7,1565987252.0,"Thank you guys for your responses. I will likely have my mom do it. I'm primarily nervous I guess because my dad did the same thing with my college graduation. We told him about ahead of time and he said he'd come. Then we couldn't get back in touch despite daily attempts, so he missed it. He seemed legitimately hurt that he wasn't there, and I've always felt sad and somehow responsible for that. I just really don't want a memory like that associated with my wedding day too."
JUSTNOMIL,ewpyn4t,t3_cncno5,1565652474.0,"Am I along to share if I‚Äôm considering not inviting my dad? My fianc√© and I got engaged in October of last year. My dad has always been flaky, so when he didn‚Äôt call or text me back the first few times, I wasn‚Äôt that annoyed. 

I didn‚Äôt get in touch with him until January, and then was finally able to tell him I‚Äôm engaged. We talked for a little bit and it was nice and all, but I haven‚Äôt heard from him since then. 

We sent save the dates in May. I‚Äôve called him and texted him weekly. I drunk texted my aunt. I don‚Äôt know how else I can try to make contact. 

We get married in November and I don‚Äôt know if my father will walk me down the aisle or if I‚Äôll be alone."

From the way they said they believe the person must be acting differently, how they ask people to focus on mannerisms, and how they say they believe he has a little bit of a conscience left, it sounds to me like they have a psychological profile, but maybe not necessarily a suspect. I feel like they know this guy must be freaking out, and they're wording things how they are to make him think they know who he is."
