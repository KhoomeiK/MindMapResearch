bipolar2,etuxpsi,t1_etux701,1563222097.0,It’s a natural survival mechanism of your mind. I’m not a professional of course but I’d say it’s probably nothing dangerous. Your mind is just trying to protect you from negative feelings. But sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between dissociation and psychotic symptoms - the second ones can be a sign of something worse. You should look those both up and talk to your therapist/psychiatrist etc about how you feel (if you have one).
