The campaign to leave was based on lies and immediately this came to light. With no exit strategy in place we've just been hurtling towards the exit deadline and extending it where possible. 

Our last election was basically the brexit referendum II. It divided the remain campaign so much that we played right into the Tory hands, and now have a right wing government intent on leaving ASAP. We are tired of the conversation and it's often said, ""this isn't the Brexit that we voted for"".

With the referendum having such a tight margin (52/48), whatever anyones's opinion on the matter, the reality is: it would've been a landslide victory for Remain if the public knew what a shambles our government would make of this exit.

If we are to go down that rabbit hole though, how do you view medication as a treatment? Since that has far clearer links with psychs than CBT or other therapies.

Also don't do it with too many people around, keep your circle restricted to no more than 4 people in the group or else things get confusing. Have a vague idea what you want to do in the trip, but don't write yourself an itinerary. 

Lastly, over the course of many trips, I've come to realise that there isn't really such a thing as a ""bad trip"". People have good moods and bad moods, we fluctuate constantly and it's ordinary to feel anxious sober. Psychedelics simply enhance the extent to which we feel these moods. If you notice yourself going down one unpleasant trail of thought, recall that you do have a certain degree of control over your psyche. The easiest to do is by moving to a different room, going outside where there's space often helps. Having someone else around to help you through this experience eases this anxiety and also lowers the burden if you do have to do something thinking. They don't necessarily have to be sober but having experience with psychedelics so that they're lucid throughout the trip will be enough."

Try not to go long stretches with no studying, I’d say no more than one day out of uni (or two for weekends).  One day can easily turn into a week and suddenly the catchup and dread gets worse. 

Things usually sink in the second time round aswell. It’s handy if you already have an understanding of the topic seeing the material again. So that helps.

Also problem questions are handy. Some topics don’t have so many so it gets tricky doing them. 

Further reading is nice aswell. Leonard susskin does a very good job of explaining things in his series of books “the theoretical minimum” and they make an easy read (for someone with half the mathematical literacy needed for the degree).

Lastly, I’m no fan, but drugs can help. Modafinil is handy at times. I run off it during this exam season. I highly dissuade from making it habitual, but on the odd occasion it helps."

“ I think you're confusing ""management"" with ""competency"". “

Management are expected to be competent. They aren’t hired on a whim. They’re observed heavily in their probation period to ensure they’re cut out for their job. A manager will always be on shift on any day. In this way, any complaints have a competent person to fall back on. It’s easy to say, “everyone should get better at their job”. In reality that won’t happen.

Hygiene checks happen very infrequently. EHO typically come round 1 or 2 times a year, at a random time. The standard is expected to be maintained throughout. If they fail a check, there’s a 2 week probation period to fix the problem. If they fail that.... food license revoked! They’re not the ones nagging people to get the cleaning done day in, day out.

Hahaha who are you to tell me I haven’t waited a table?!!! That was my first job. I’ve worked in various bars since. People get arsey, sometimes they get out of hand and someone needs to step in.

Something goes wrong with an order, the customer starts complaining and the waiter feels uncomfortable handling the situation. it then falls down to the supervisor on shift to sort out the situation. Without that who handles it? if there’s no supervisor then is it the collective responsibility of the workforce to do it? What if all the waiters don’t want to handle the situation? They’re not paid any more to do so so why should they accept this responsibility and stress.

What about when it comes down to hygiene? Food needs to be kept in date and cross contamination avoided at all costs. Who makes sure this is being done? It falls down to the manager to ensure this is being done day to day. They get paid enough to care about these. At the end of the day, if the managers telling orders to see this done, that’s fair game because the work needs to be done.  If someone else starts barking these orders.... people get annoyed. They know it’s important work but nobody wants to do the deep cleaning jobs that keep hygiene standards up. 

What if they’re understaffed? Who gets to decide who gets hired and how? Who is in charge of training people? The restaurant needs organising to run well. Who gets to decide who gets fired?

It’s only natural that a restaurant needs someone coordinating this together. That’s why mangers are hired. They get paid to do the jobs other people don’t want to.
