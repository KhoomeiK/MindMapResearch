I’m not sure what is, so if you can find evidence against that please show me, but I believe that due to the stereotype of males needing to be strong emotionally and physically, we hide our emotions which build up and cause trauma. But not violent crime. I think typically poverty is the cause for the majority of violent crime. And a lot of men I know don’t accuse women of being too emotional. We accept people need space sometimes and respect that, but we give the same logic to other guys. But anyway, if you have any true, solid evidence against what I say, please send it to me, I’d love to know the true figures if I’m wrong."
