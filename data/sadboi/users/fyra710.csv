I told the officer that I didn't want to press charges but because of the law with Domestic Violence they have to separate to give an extra cool down time.

It's important to have your needs known especially with parents and the fact that they're laughing it appears to me that they want a rise out of you, because I'm not there and I don't know the whole story I could be wrong. If it turns out that that is the case, ignore them! family or not you get to choose who you're around and what makes you comfortable. I'm sorry to hear that being with family is uncomfortable."
