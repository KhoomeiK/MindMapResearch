I compared it to a bad headache that starts to go away - eventually, it is gone, and you didn't even realize when it went away. 

The timeline for a complete return to normal might sound awful - months, for example - but between now and then will be a gradual return to normal. There will be some time where we aren't in full lockdown, but we also aren't back to having tens of thousands of people crowding into stadiums. That will still be the ""social distancing"" phase, but not the ""quarantine"" phase.

This is an excellent point. R0 diminishes with immunity. As immunity goes up - even with relaxation of containment/mitigation efforts - the rate of spread will naturally decrease because the susceptible population is lower. We don't need to get to 51 - 76% of the population infected for the spread to *slow*, we need to get to that percentage for it to stop. In the meantime it would likely taper off without any intervention. 

In theory, that could make it easier to adapt our mitigation efforts towards protecting elderly and vulnerable populations, while letting those at lower risk perform their own risk assessment."
