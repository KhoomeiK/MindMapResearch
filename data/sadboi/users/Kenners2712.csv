Anxiety,fq67xiv,t1_fp07aeh,1589126301.0,"Before I was diagnosed with anxiety I thought I had some kind of recurrent stomach virus.... For a year.... During this period I was given a super low dose of amitriptyline (used to be used as an anti-depressant at high dose) to help with the stomach upset, I take these in the evening - took a week to get used to it but omg it's helped SO much. I also take omeprazole which is an anti-acid, as even though I don't get the pain of acid reflux apparently I still have it (discovered during a gastroscopy). It really helps to calm my stomach and stop the nausea and diarrhea which are the main symptoms of my anxiety. My anxiety causes my stomach to produce a lot of acid which causes the diarrhea and vomiting.

From what I've seen on Reddit lots of people are on all kind of meds which I've never heard of, these two I'm on are solely to treat the physical symptoms in my stomach/gut. 

Hopefully this helps somewhat! :)"

ActualHealth,flncxag,t1_flnb45u,1585315734.0,"But that's not what you initially said - you linked being drunk in public as you make yourself a target e.g. victim blaming. 

Your post validates the opinion of some people that if a woman is alone and drunk she deserves what's coming to her. It's literally encouraging the rape culture that permeates our society. It puts the onus entirely on the victim and not the perpetrator and it is soooo wrong. 

Most women who are victims of sexual assault / murder are either in a relationship or just out of a relationship with their attacker. So should we just not get into a relationship with anyone? Should we not be able to get drunk with our partner? Rapers and murders for the most part aren't the bogeyman who hide around corners or wait outside clubs for unsuspecting women, they are in your home's, your friendship groups, your family. 

I'm not encouraging women to go out drinking alone, but if they want to (which they are fully entitled to and I have done alot) or if they end up in a situation where they are alone then they are in NO WAY RESPONSIBLE FOR SOMEONE ASSAULTING THEM!! I don't get how this is a such a difficult concept?!"

Shoestring,fizs83s,t3_fanhav,1582872601.0,"A week is quite a long time to spend in London if you are on a budget - I reckon 3 days is a good amount then you can spend 2 days in 2 other cities to give you the proper British experience. 

For London:

(I lived in London so I know nothing about hostel/hotel pricing sorry!).

Travel - as others has said it can be expensive BUT there is a limit that you can be charged each day for travel within zones 1-2 (the most central areas), when I last checked this was £7.20 Which is good value and you don't need to organise getting an oyster card as you can use your contactless card and the limit still applies. The bus is £1.50 per journey to any zone, and walking is of course free! Download citymapper - it's what every Londoner uses and is a life saver!

Food - again food in London can be expensive BUT not always. For breakfast I would head to a Gregg's, they do a bacon/sausage bam and a hot drink for £2, you can't beat it. For lunch/dinner there are many cheapish choices which serve delicious food and one of my favourite central restaurants is Flat Iron. They do a flat iron steak for £11 which comes with a side salad (if you are feeling spendy get the aubergine parmigiana and creamed spinach, you won't regret it). The Covent Garden flat iron is the best as they also give you free delicious salted caramel ice-cream when you leave. (There is a really cool pub nearby called The Porterhouse where you can wait for your table to be ready - do not expect to get seated straight away, it's usually an hour wait). Another great place quite central is Pastaio in Carnaby/Soho, it does fantastic pasta dishes at a fair price and doesn't have any queues unlike Padella in London Bridge (Flour & Grape is a great alternative here). But as others have said if you are on a really really small budget, meal deals are the way forward. 

(And now to the best bit) ACTIVITIES - there are SO many free things to do in London, it is actually crazy. My favourite place in the whole of London is the Natural History Museum, it's free and the architecture is STUNNING. It is also right next to the Science Museum (also free) and the V&A (partially free), also nearby is the Royal Albert Hall and opposite that is Hyde Park. You can basically walk from Oxford Street or Soho via Hyde Park or Knightsbridge to all of those museums and galleries. It's definitely do-able but you might be super tired by the end. 
Another free (or very cheap) activity is going to a comedy show, in Covent Garden is the Top Secret Comedy Club which does cheap/free improv and stand up nights early in the week. You could also grab a ticket to a west end show monday-wednesday pretty cheaply (I'm talking less than £20 to see Les Miserables and The Book of Mormon). 
Other classic activities which are not to be missed:
- Tower Bridge and the Tower of London
- Tate Modern and the millennium bridge
- London Tombs (if anyone tells you the London Dungeons are better they are wrong).
- Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery, and the West End/Piccadilly Circus (don't go to Leicester Square, it's an overcrowded hell hole).
- the British Museum 
- the Barbican (if you like brutal concrete architecture you'll love the Barbican)
Walking tours are a great way to see London. I've only been on architecture ones (I work in construction) but I'm sure there are some fantastic historical ones as well. The architecture ones I've been on can be found on these websites: https://newlondonarchitecture.org/whats-on/new-london-architecture-walking-tours/new-london-architecture-walking-tours and https://www.architecturefoundation.org.uk/tours

I'm going to go out on a limb and recommend something a bit different to the normal London trips - Brixton! Usually people say go to Notting Hill and Portabello road or Camden or Shoreditch but these places are soooo busy now, and if you want to see how South Londoners live then Brixton is the place for you. It's got a beautiful old indoor market that has been transformed with little shops, cafes and restaurants. There is also Electric Avenue, Coldharbour Lane, POP (a shipping container venue to rival box park), the Black Cultural Archives, Hootenanny for music, great pubs like the Duke of Edinburgh, the gorgeous Water Lane leading to Brockwell Park Park (you can see the whole city from the top of the hill) and the Lido, and finally if you are there on a Tuesday evening you can swing by Effra Social and partake in the infamous pub quiz for £2. (Can you tell I love it there).
Brixton is easy to reach as the last stop on the Victoria Line (underground), you can even stop off at Pimlico on the way to go to the Tate Britain (much better than the Tate Modern in my eyes but I hate modern art - each to their own I guess). 

For outside of London I would recommend going to: Brighton, Bath, Manchester, Liverpool, York or Edinburgh. Each has its unique qualities and attractions. Brighton and Bath are quite expensive due to their closeness to London (South England is v pricey). I've lived in Manchester and love it, and Edinburgh is where I want to live next - it's just so beautiful. 

If you are into sport, premiership rugby games and lower league football games are quite cheap, particularly mid-week matches so that could be a fun and very British activity. 

Hope some of this helps :) have an amazing trip."
Edinburgh,ffwt1za,t3_evmkde,1580310331.0,"Sounds mad but touch all the walls - often people do a repaint to spruce a place up for selling but you can still feel whether a wall is damp even if it doesn't look it.

Like others have suggested it's good to see what neighbouring properties conditions are like. 

If you are looking at a flat in a block ask about the ground rent price/any recent increases and ongoing maintenance (this is particularly important re. Lifts and roofs as those can be v expensive and often come on top of general ground rents).

Also check the local planning permissions - you should be able to type in a street name or postcode into your local councils planning portal and you will get a list of planning approvals and planning applications (not yet approved). You can see if anyone is doing any major works or even extensions (if you are looking one day to add value to your home you can use evidence of other houses gaining planning approval as an indication of what you could achieve and also a starting point for negotiations with your local planning officers).

Some bark a couple of times but most are super chill and are friendly.

solotravel,fdwo8zc,t3_en4vzn,1578760779.0,"Ah your 90 day Asia tour sounds amazing! 

Based on my experience of Asia (currently on a 6 month adventure here!) I would do the following:

Vietnam - 14 days tour from north to south (Hanoi, Halong Bay, Pu Luong, Hoi An, HCMC)

Cambodia - 7 days (Phnom Penh, Siem Reap)

Bangkok - 5 days

Kathmandu - 7 days

Malaysia - 10 days (Penang, Kuala Lumpur)

Singapore - 5 days

Philippines / Indonesia - 14 days 

Total days: 62
Spare days: 28*

Vietnam
I would definitely spend a bit more time if you can in Vietnam - there are some amazing two week itineries which can be found via google for doing the south-north trip, though starting in Hanoi and working your way down would be easier if you are planning on going to Cambodia afterwards. Hanoi IMO is a much better city than HCMC though I prefer the less modern side to Vietnam in general so my opinion is a wee biased. If you really want to see rural Vietnam life then stay in Pu Luong, it's a nature reserve south of Hanoi and it's the best place I went to. Also if you do go to Hanoi then you should go to Halong Bay (or Cat Ba as we did, just as beautiful but half the price of Halong Bay). Also in the south I went to Ben Tre and Can Tho which are short bus rides from HCMC and were my second/third fave places in Vietnam). But as I said before there are some great blogs online. 

Cambodia
Phnom Penh - I found Phnom Penh a bit boring tbh, it's palace and museums weren't that interested (perhaps I was a bit templed-out by this point). What was fascinating was the killing fields and prison museum, a really sobering experience. I would spend 3 days here max.
Siem Reap - ankhor watttt. That's all I need to say.

Bangkok - I love Bangkok, the food is fantastic and it's cheap (though not as cheap as Vietnam). I stayed at the cloud on Saladaeng Silom hostel which was really really nice. Silom area is the business area which means it has great food markets at lunch and dinner! And it's right next to one of Bangkok's few green spaces, Lumphini Park. My Bangkok highlights: Wat Pho, watching the sunset from Sala Ratthanakosin rooftop bar, the street food in Silom, Bangkok culture and arts centre. 

Kathmandu - I've never been but my sister has and she did an amazing trek (it was with a women only company so no point in recommending it to you but I'm sure there are many great companies there). 

Malaysia - there is SO much to see in Malaysia (it's my next stop on my travels) but I have put just Penang and KL in here as they are the obvious must sees. Again the food in Malaysia is said to be amazing (half of my travels revolve around food, currently in the south of Thailand near Krabi in a beach touristy area which is three times the price of Bangkok for food and nowhere near as good flavour, I'm leaving here soon!). 

Singapore - I've also never been to Singapore but it's where I am ending my trip in march. I'm luckily staying with a friend who lives there so am saving a lot of money. From my research I think 4-5 days will be enough to spend there. 

Philippines / Indonesia (Bali) - have you done research into the weather? I am heading to the Philippines after Malaysia as the weather in Indonesia isn't as good as the Philippines in Feb/March (my bf who I am travelling with made us a spreadsheet which the AVG temp and rain fall for each location in SE Asia every month - I thought it was a waste of time but it's actually been useful and pretty accurate). I would LOVE to go to Bali if the weather was good, I've also heard really good things about Lombok (next to Bali - much cheaper and less crowded). 

*Spare days
As some people have commented, don't plan too much as you may like a place and want to stay longer. We usually don't book our next hostel until the day before we go, often booking 2 nights to begin with then extending our stay. We've found Agoda is really good for last minute bargains including nicer hostels/hotels which were previously out of our price range. We aim to spend less than £10 a night each and have pretty much managed that on average so far. 

Anyway I hope some of this helps, enjoy your travels :)"

Shoestring,fdq2vrl,t1_fdq2psq,1578652187.0,Yeah I think the same rules apply - if they don't have a guarantee that your money is protected then don't book with them. Also if it looks too good to be true than it probably is too good to be true (I've learnt that the hard way haha!).

Sometimes I contact the hotel anyway to request a smoke free room or whatever just to make sure they know you are coming. 

For most of my hotel bookings I use Agoda (particularly in Asia) or booking.com - I think they are now owned by the same company or are linked somehow as you can see the booking.com reviews on Agoda which gives you a better picture of the hotel you are viewing. Agoda seems to have the cheapest pricing. 

Hope this helps! :)"
Shoestring,fdq226i,t3_emnz4f,1578651021.0,"Hi! I am currently in Thailand with my bf I would say you only need 2-3 full days in Bangkok. I've been there twice and it's easily enough to do the major sites and explore the different foods. My highlights were: Wat Pho, Jim Thompson House, and the Bangkok art and cultural centre. If you want to splurge go to the rooftop bar at Sala Ratthanakosin for the sunset over Wat Arun Ratchawararam, get there early for a good spot but be prepared to pay £8+ for a cocktail. Bangkok also has some AMAZING night markets, try and be there for the weekend as some of them are weekend only.
We stayed in the Silom area which is the business district but has a ton of good restaurants, in particular the street food markets were amazing as they catered to locals (great flavour) and were pretty cheap. We stayed in Cloud on Saladaeng Silom for £23 a night for a double room with shared bathroom. It was one of the nicest hostels I've ever stayed in and the shared bathroom was actually so so nice and clean. Highly recommend. 

From Bangkok you can get a super cheap flight down to Krabi and you can get to Phuket or other destinations from there. We are staying on Koh Kwang beach which is a 30 min shared minibus from Krabi airport (200baht each), we are stayed in the White Sand House Hotel which is £29.50 a night. From here we've been renting a motorbike to get to the other beaches but we have one literally infront of our hotel which is beautiful. 
We didn't go to Phuket, Koh Phi Phi or Koh Lanta as from other comments, blogs and research they seem v expensive, v busy, touristy, and geared towards westerners. Where we are stayed has a little of that but it's not too bad an our beach is basically empty. Do a bit of research (some other posters on Reddit have some great suggestions) and I'm sure you can find a place which has the beauty of Phuket but is half the price, Ao Nang Beach and Railey Beach could be a place to start.

Also some people will try to rip you off but don't be discouraged, I see most offers for tours/trips and taxis as a starting point for negotiations. They will almost always drop their prices!

EDIT: I got the name of the beach infront of our hotel wrong, oops!"
TraveltoVietnam,fdq14xd,t3_ec0f04,1578649692.0,"I would mix up your more touristy/city destinations with more rural ones. We went to Hanoi> Cat Ba > Ninh Binh (Tam Coc) > Pu Luong > Ho Chi Minh/ Saigon > Phu Quoc > Ben Tre > Can Tho. 
I travelled with my bf and we much much preferred the places we hadn't heard much about - Pu Luong, Ben Tre and Can Tho. 

We had planned on going to Sapa but ended up staying in Pu Luong for a week as it was so peaceful. It is a nature reserve so is very rural and non-touristy. We stayed at Pu Luong Holiday Homestay which has dorms as well as private rooms. We met solo travellers, a few couples and a family there. You can borrow mountain bikes for free (which is handy as the WiFi is patchy at best at the homestay so you can cycle to the post office which is free), walk to local waterfalls to swim in, go hiking around the hills/mountains. The food is also delicious. It was incredible. 

In Ben Tre we stayed outside the city in a homestay called Quoc Phuong Riverside Homestay which was stunning, on a river and even had a pool (a rare luxury in homestays!). The owner can take you on a private boat tour of the Mekong Delta for a fair price. The food again was amazing. 

In Can Tho we stayed in the West Hotel (a v. Western hotel) situated right above the street market which is buzzing all day. Along the road is the night food market and you are basically on the Mekong River. The city has lots of secret sites you can explore (not much info online other than the floating markets trips). It felt far more 'authentic' if that is the right word, not touristy at all (I am aware of the irony as I am a tourist). 

I don't know much about long term staying and working abroad but I think looking outside of the 'top 5 Vietnam destinations' would be a good place to start if you are looking for a more well rounded experience."
solotravel,fdq0bq4,t3_eaka4m,1578648546.0,"My bf and I (from the UK) have recently travelled around both China (4 weeks) and Japan (2 weeks) so I have some thoughts / advice / tips that could help you decide:

China: really easy to travel around on the high speed and normal trains, much cheaper hotels and food, a bigger culture shock than Japan. 

We went to (in this order): Beijing, Xi'an, Shanghai (day trips to Suzhou and Hangzhou), Huangshan, Zhangjiajie, Guilin (Yangshou) and finished in Hong Kong. We would say our favourite places were Xi'an, Zhangjiajie and Guilin. Xi'an was such an amazing old city which had great food and we did a lot of walking around as it's not too big. 

Zhangjiajie - you have to buy the three day pass to Wulingyuan scenic area / Zhangjiajie national park (you get no choice in this and it's activated by your thumb print so you can't sell it on). It is v busy and there are monkeys everywhere (do not feed them - it destroys their natural social hierarchy and makes them super aggressive, we saw many one-eyed and one-handed monkeys). We stayed in Zhangjiajie City (Hotel California £63 for three nights, nice hotel v near the train and bus station, lots of cheap restaurants around) which is supposed to be better for accessing the most famous mountain area but we didn't do that as it's more expensive, if we did it again we would stay in Wulingyuan village so we didn't need to get the bus everyday to and from the park. This blog helped us a ton with planning: https://www.nomadasaurus.com/the-avatar-mountains-zhangjiajie-national-forest-park/ 

Guilin - we actually stayed in the Yangshou area near the River Yulong, not the more famous River Le. We found this area to be much quieter and great for walking/cycling. The scenery is out of this world!! We didn't do a boat tour as we cycled the route the tour would do anyway so we saved a ton of money on that, and you can easily reach some of the climable karsts by bicycle. 
We stayed at the Yangshou Mountain Nest (£135 for four nights), a beautiful hotel (slightly more pricey than hostels but not as expensive as lots of the resort's nearby) and we loved it. To get there we got a taxi from Guilin North, bartering down to 270, do not accept above 300 even if they start at 500 - get your calculator on your phone out and start negotiating! 

If you want to hear anymore about china let me know, I wrote a fairly detailed diary during out travels. 

Japan: even easier than China to travel around, we were there for the rugby world cup and they had tons of staff on hand at all the train stations to help. This year Tokyo is hosting the Olympics so I think they are warming up to this event. It's incredibly clean, efficient, and it just has this magical feeling about it which is difficult to describe! The hotels and food are a bit more expensive but you can still find good deals, our hotels were expensive due to the RWC and we had only planned it being a 2 week holiday which then progressed to being a 6 month tour of Asia! 

In order we went to (due to the RWC matches): Tokyo, Hiroshima, Kyoto, Odawara, Tokyo. 

Tokyo - we stayed on our first visit in Akasaka (Hotel Risveglio Akasaka £436 for 5 nights) which is apparently a business district but that means it's got a ton of good restaurants and has a vibrant nightlife. It has a subway nearby but it isn't on the JR line (if you do go to Japan get the JR pass as it will save you a ton of money on the high-speed trains). On our second visit we stayed in Shibuyu (£356 for 3 nights, the hotel name has changed to something I can't remember). Shibuyu also has a ton going on but we didn't get to experience it all as we were there during the Typhoon Hagibis.   
Tokyo is full of amazing things to do but our top attractions were: Imperial Palace Gardens (free), Ameyoko night market, Toyokawa Inari Shrine (free), Meji-Jingu Shrine (not free), Nezu Museum (not free). 

Hiroshima - we stayed near the train station at Hotel Flex Hiroshima (£177 for two nights). The a-bomb dome and peace museum are a 40 min walk so we did that the day we arrived which I highly recommend. The second day we did a trip to Miyajama Island which was incredible, you can hike to the top if the mountain on the island (or get the cable car) and the views are spectacular. There are also a number of historical buildings / sites / temples to visit on the island. It was one of our highlights of the entire trip. 

Kyoto - Kyoto for us was a mixed bag as it's incredibly touristy, however when you get away from the tourists its so beautiful. We stayed in Hotel Resol Kyoto Kawaramachi Sanjo (£309 for three nights) which is in a fantastic location for food and transport. 
Highlights of Kyoto: climbing up Mt.Daimon, hiking up the hill behind the 'bamboo forest' in Arashiyama. 

Odawara - we stayed here so for access to one of the RWC games but it turned out to be a really nice port town. We stayed in the Hinode Ryoken (£176 for two nights), it didn't have its own onsen but it did have a hot springs stone bath which was heaven. From Odawara we were able to reach the Hakone national park by train (where Mt.Fuji is), because of the RWC most of the Mt.Fuji accommodation and tours were super expensive but just doing a hike around the Hakone lake and surrounding area we got a great view of Mt.Fuji in the distance and we spent a lot less than others we met on our trip.

Overall as a budget traveller I would choose China, it's much much cheaper and possibly the most amazing place I've ever been. I think to travel around Japan (there is so much to see and I would love to go back) you need more money and will have to be much more vigilant with your spending. 

I have so much information about both that I didn't know what to put but I hope the above helps :)"

I just love it as a city, I think it's a good mix of having all the cultural things to do as well as feeling like much more of a community than London.

Scotland,fc50cwt,t1_fc4xr02,1577436603.0,"Yeah I've read some not too favourable comments about underbelly and the council in Edinburgh, it seems quite similar to London in that respect. 

Having lived in Manchester for four years before I am used to the rain, though my bf isn't so keen on it. I think I'll have to take him to Glasgow to show him it's not always wet!

Thank you for your advice :)

Scotland,fc4vwj4,t1_fc4uanh,1577430580.0,"Yeah we are thinking of doing something like that, I'm  just worried we will only see the tourists perspective so it would be good to have locals perspectives. 

If it helps we are leaving London because it's just so busy and we want to be somewhere which still has stuff going on but is also not far away from the countryside for hiking etc. I'm a hockey player and he's massively into football (watching and playing) so any info about clubs as well would be great. We like a good pub over a night out."
UKPersonalFinance,fc2fmwk,t3_efu11g,1577357478.0,"Hi,
I tried some budgeting apps but found that none of them really helped in saving anything just knowing how much I was spending, instead I tried taking what I wanted to spend over a month out in cash, dividing it into four piles and then using one pile a week - no exceptions. Then I could put money away into my help to buy ISA and stocks and shares ISA (I use Hargreaves Lansdowne recommended funds) - that way I am budgeting and also making money on what I am saving. I've saved much more this way than just using budgeting apps."

From my experience it's better to eat what the locals are eating and you should be fine!"
