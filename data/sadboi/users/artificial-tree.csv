I had to improvise a little bit to make the pie taste even better, 

- i added 3 tbl spoons of Worcestershire sauce, 

- instead of heavy cream (didn't have it) i used a mix of thick cream and mayo,

- i didn't have pie crust, so i used puff pastry dough instead (came out just as good!) And i also added some shredded cheese under the top cover, it made the top crusty and crispy and chewy, i highly recommend that! 

- i put extra cup of chopped rump steak and mushies, so it would be enough to fill bellies of 4 people :) 

- the way i made te breathing holes on the top, i did the same for the bottom before putting the filling in, so it baked thru and made the bottom crusty as the top. 

- i also added fresh chopped parsley and a bit of coriander for the flavour. 

Cheers!

I was also getting depressed because of uncontrollable hunger and weight gain. I was too embarrassed and upset to start going to the gym (they were open back then) and i thought i wohld never be able to be fit again. 

Since December i lost 5 kg, as i started working out at home (i was not so embarrassed while doing exercise and knowing that no one is watching or judging me, so i could relax to the heavy music i've been listening to, to take my thoughts away from me being fat and not hearing my panting during exercise is very important). The first two weeks of regular exercise are always the most difficult, especially because there is no short-term result, that can make ypu feel happier. But it always comes! First thing you notice, is when your muscles are toning up, and with days you feel getting fitter and in a month you will notice weight going away. 

You almost don't need to restict foods, just maybe reduce a bit of sugar and carbs consumption to increase the speed of losing weight. It helped e so much, that now i don't even think what i am eating, because i know i can control my weight. It becomes easy.
