relationship_advice,fpc6v9s,t1_fpc68aq,1588489599.0,"Also a personal note to help you understand the process at least a little and to help encourage you to not be scared. I worked with a guy who was my manager. He was about 35 years old. He hit on EVERY girl at our store, including the underage ones. He was a raging alcoholic and brought it to work. He was doing a lot that made me uncomfortable and would intentionally cross my boundaries. One night I told him to stop doing something and he threw up on my car, left it and drove off, when he got off early. I took photos and was thinking of telling the boss bc stomach acid ruined my paint. He found out and he came back to our store. Drunk he cornered me into a fridge and began yelling at me. 

I went directly to my boss's boss because she is a woman and I was having issues talking to a man about it, also past experiences my boss didn't give a fuck. I emailed her what happened. She called me and set up an HR meeting. We spoke about what happened and detailed everything. I sent her photos and gave her a written and spoken statement. She did this with everyone involved and everyone working. It's important to have a witness or proof which you do through those texts and camera footage of him following behind you, even if you didn't you can ask around and she if any other young women are having issues with him. I also talked with my co-workers and found he had done horrible things to them and had them reach out. He was fired and our store flourished because of it. I wasn't called a snitch and I didn't have any backlash, they were happy to actually get extra hours and I opened up the manager spot for someone who deserves it. I refused a transfer because I enjoyed my store and do not regret that. I pissed my boss off and wish I went to him first but he understands the sensitivity of it now and why I picked his boss to tell."

Do not return that dog if you want to have a good relationship with your daughter. She will never forgive you and if she does she will be mad for a long time first. Can you legitimately not afford an extra $60 a month? My cat costs me about $30 a month. The initial cost is a lot because you have to buy leash, toys and a bed. You can probably budget the dog in. Also when your daughter is old enough she could get a part time job to help with the expense of her new dog. 

HOWEVER your wife completely blindsided you and also used her daughter as a tool of manipulation to get what she wanted (dog). I would suggest if able or covered by insurance to find a marriage counselor or therapist. They have some free ones that work well enough in my state.

Do things for yourself that makes you feel good, I like doing my make-up and trying new outfits out. Watch some feel good movies or tv shows. Focus on yourself and what you love about yourself. 

I know everyone is stuck at home but maybe some one on one time could be helpful if you guys can. A picnic in the backyard or a drive thru the city. You need some quality you time and some quality time with him. You will move past this slowly but time does heal.

I don't watch porn as an adult but I enjoy -some- kinks. I was raped in my sleep (woke up during) and for a very long time anyone touching me in my sleep would result in a huge panic attack. My ex/rapist brushed it off as a ""sleep sex kink"". I spent years in therapy for that and a lot of other trauma I suffered. I am not the biggest fan of this kink.

But my comment was that I don't think it's the kinks fault this happened.

A personal experience to elaborate my thought process. My partner helped me lose weight by telling me I was beautiful. He never mentioned my weight negatively and I took steps to lose it for myself and not for anyone else. Supporting your partner is a great way to help them be healthier. Happiness and improving yourself esteem is a great motivator to want to change the way you live. Overeating for me is caused by depression and stress. My ex who would shame me for my weight, tell me it's unhealthy constantly (surprise fat people know this), or talk about how he prefers stick skinny women.
