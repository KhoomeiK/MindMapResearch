Makeup,f9lc3k5,t3_e5jz6d,1575419459.0,I honestly think any like liquid lipstick that dries matte tends to transfer a lot less than your normal lipstick. A lot of people reccomend the huda beauty ones which i havent tried yet. I use the sephora cream lip stain which doesnt dry your lips out and feels really nice on your lips. They have so many different shades and it is really affordable.
