 1) shit breaks. a keg washer/filler thats been firing 20 hours a day, seven days a week will have something break eventually. Sometimes the machine stops, but usually a cycle gets ""skipped"" and its up to the operator to catch it. The odds of him having advanced mechanics knowledge is slim. At a brewery I worked at the hoses were old and rarely gives a caustic cycle. It blew my mind how often a hot water rise and sani purge was the whole treatment before xfer. that brewery went on to win GABF brewery of the year so shows what I know.

 2) Professional operation means working on a tight schedule. We need 120 kegs on the truck at noon. NO MATTER WHAT. corners get cut. That bright tank god sani'd right? right? i'm sure it did

3) Staffing. Not everyone who works in a craft brewery is putting the love and care into the beer a homebrewer does. I always did, but I was considered a squeaky wheel in terms of QC. To most of the staff its just another job. 

Overall even if your systems are safe 99% of the time, you're going to get infection-vulnerable beer going out the door. Maybe you've (not actually talking about you) been getting away with lax standards because you're making trendy HIPAs that could have a rhino turd floating around in the keg and no one would notice.
