SuicideWatch,fqsvd5v,t1_fqs7mg5,1589620201.0,Wow you should be a writer! Your comment was so beautiful. Seek out writing opportunities or write about suicide. I'm a writer myself. I recognize your talent as well as your writing gift. Please don't leave this world- keep writing. Those that are truly suffering in this world need to read your compassionate and endearing writing style. You could save many lives! Perhaps this is your purpose in life. I believe in you.
kratom,fp6do4n,t1_fp5iyo4,1588350551.0,"I second this! Addiction and being dependent on painkillers to control severe, physical pain in order to have any quality of life is 2 totally DIFFERENT things."
MadeMeSmile,fofm789,t3_g76tb9,1587738750.0,Dear Mary-Fuck off.
SuicideWatch,foe3y0r,t1_fnoizix,1587695543.0,"Hey Beekeeper, came to check in on you. How are you doing? Did you find a way to get your med?"
SuicideWatch,fnoid9p,t3_g2hrxj,1587125919.0,"You mentioned financial issues. Have you reached out to the drug manufacturer? If you found a med that helped, seek ways to get that instead of playing the old suicide track playing in your head. I know it's extremely hard to do."
opiates,fnk258y,t1_fnjzr6j,1587012790.0,"Hey I think you should be really proud of yourself! It takes courage to use a drug that helps you stay clean from hard drugs. Also, you are not cheating by taking Subs. The truth is you are actually helping your body to stay healthy which is yet another reason to be proud of yourself. You ARE sober from hardcore drugs. Don't ever believe in society's construct of what it means to be sober. This is where many of the negative thinking/negative beliefs originate from. Rise above the negative thinking by distracting yourself. This will help your mind lessen the chains of negative thinking so they won't strongly affect you like they do now.

 It's also important to not taper down too quickly because many addicts relapse by doing so. Take your time and taper down correctly. You will get to the other side of recovery. But while you are walking this difficult path, be extremely proud of how far you have come!"
AskReddit,fnby8xw,t1_fmoj1lq,1586824722.0,THIS. Totally agree with you. Every second counts in a life and death emergency. Save someone's life. Worry about the bill later.
SuicideWatch,fmq9xl0,t3_fwp7or,1586295645.0,"So you are in your 20's and you think you have failed at everything in life. So what?! Keep trying!! One of the ways to finally succeed at life is to keep trying. Even when you are dead tired, emotionally and physically exhausted, wanting to give up-those are the 'tries' that matter the most in life. I don't know if someone ever told you but it's perfectly okay that you failed at so many things. There will be another day of 'try agains' if you are willing to accept the challenge of waking up again in the morning. Every second you are alive is another chance to fail or succeed."
SuicideWatch,fmcuxaw,t3_fug0gb,1585953334.0,"I'm truly sorry that you feel that way. The first step is to try to open up more to others in your life that can empathize with you. You sound like a really compassionate person. If you need someone that cares about how you are feeling, feel free to DM me. Or talk to us because there are others like me that truly care when a fellow human being is hurting. Life hurts sometimes but it doesn't have to hurt all the time."
depression,fm9530b,t1_fm4i0qe,1585861873.0,"Who told you that you couldn't go outside!?? I mean if you are away from people, what's the harm in going outside? I ask because our governor said even if we are quarantined we can go outside. Sunlight and fresh air can help you feel a little better."
kratom,fm48rs8,t3_fshwp6,1585749156.0,"Thank you Kratom for all the good years we have had together! This plant has allowed me to survive one of the worst pain diseases in the world (CRPS) that has a very high suicide rate. Without this awesome plant, pain would skyrocket and shatter my mind and soul as CRPS pain levels can quickly spiral out of control...and contrary to popular belief uncontrolled pain can physically kill. So I'm grateful that Kratom exists not only for my sake but for all of those that benefit from it. Keep this thread going people!"
SuicideWatch,flomlet,t1_floep01,1585341224.0,"Hey there! First of all, don't place so much importance on downvotes. Bots can downvote many posts, yours included, for no reason at all. Please Listen to the people who reach out and offer supportive words to help you get through the difficult times. Also, YOU are NOT stupid. Others care for you. And if it helps you to open up, please do. You are far more stronger than you think and will be able to make it through the dark times in your life."
SuicideWatch,fln8mio,t3_fpq4ql,1585312501.0,"You don't deserve to die just because your life has been hell! I hope that you survived this painful attempt at ending your life. You are young- you can make your life however you want it to be as you get older. As for now, all you gotta do is survive the bad moments. Ignore anyone that brings negativity into your life. Lock them out of your thoughts. They don't deserve to have any space in your mind."
SuicideWatch,flm5sy6,t3_fpcm4p,1585275252.0,"After reading everyone's comments, my questions are: What are words that actually help or comfort you during your darkest hours? And what are actions that people can do to help you get through those difficult times?"
SuicideWatch,fljt8i8,t3_fovt69,1585225862.0,"It may feel like you/your life will always be like this but life always changes. Stay for the good/bad rollercoaster ride that every human being is on. You never know what the next day will bring. When all is said and done, we are all looking for what will bring us happiness, motivation, strength, goals etc: we are all an everchanging being. If you check out of this world, you will never meet your full potential of the awesome things that you are capable of doing. We are here for you and to help guide you out of the black hole you are in."
kratom,fkxwt0g,t3_fl8hs7,1584636942.0,"Answer: No. Like others, I've used this plant for several years. You really need to get checked out. Difficulty breathing is not something to mess around with and ignore. And if it gets worse, call for emergency assistance. Hope you feel better soon!"
SuicideWatch,fkmgsyu,t3_fj5y09,1584328675.0,"Ok I hear you and get what you are saying. Challenge yourself with a question. Ask yourself ""What would you be like in that moment if you were 3 times more confident/bold?"" For example, take the situation of a stranger in line with you at the supermarket. In that moment, ask yourself that specific challenge question. Don't over think it. Just quickly answer the challenge question. Then act like that!"
SuicideWatch,fjd443h,t3_fcpl6j,1583245187.0,"I'm so very sorry to hear your mom has cancer.   Some people survive cancer and others don't. If your mom leaves this world, you should embrace life. You are a living testament that she is an amazing woman because she created an incredible human being:You! She didn't give you a precious life so that you could throw your life away by killing yourself. She wanted you to experience everything that this life has to offer. Good and bad. Just remember, no storm lasts forever. Eventually the clouds will make room for the sun to break through."
SuicideWatch,fjbs10e,t1_fjaz1lj,1583200157.0,"Listen Up: A car may run out of gas but that's when other people will help push the car for you. Think of all these random people, offering you their friendship, prayers, a virtual shoulder to cry on as the people that are willing to help you push your car that's out of gas. Don't ever give up on yourself."
SuicideWatch,fj9apoa,t1_fj7a6a5,1583139628.0,"Agree with you 150 percent. The child is the one that will bear the heavy, endless burden of the suicide of the selfish parent. He will forever ask himself/herself what did he do so wrong that their parent had to take their own life..."
Drugs,fj61whw,t3_fbpl3v,1583052641.0,Lol no you won't get high at all. You will have total control over any allergy symptoms like the rest said.
Drugs,fj617fm,t3_fbos7i,1583051696.0,Yikes-Are u sure u aren't having an allergic reaction with the hives and swollen tongue aspect of your nightmare?
