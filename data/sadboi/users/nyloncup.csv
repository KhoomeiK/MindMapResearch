LesbianActually,fl24du2,t3_fll0ki,1584742673.0,It’s because of your eyebrows!!! They’re STRONG! People are scared of strong. Eyebrows that are furrowed like that will read angry to some people. It’s not a bad thing. It makes you look super cooool(and pretty) I wish I looked more intimidating. Everybody tells me I look so cute and harmless!! It sucks! It’s because of my chubby cheeks!!!

EatingDisorders,fix72qv,t1_fix6qzw,1582814214.0,"Being thin does not mean you are healthy. What you're doing now to lose weight is unhealthy. Health does not just reflect your appearance. It reflects your mind too. I know it can be diffuclt for men to speak out about these things, but I promise that a therapist who specializes in eating disorders has seen men who have problems similar to yours. It seems like you are aware that your behaviors are concerning hence this reddit post. You don't have to be diagnosed to get help."
EatingDisorders,fix6qzw,t3_faa2ke,1582813993.0,"You talk so negatively about yourself.  You don't deserve anything that you are doing to yourself, just because you're larger now. I think it would be best if you talked to a professional about all of your negative views surrounding yourself and how that might relate to how this woman in your post sees you. You are more than what she thinks of you. I hope you can see that."
progresspics,fi5mdzr,t3_f6kw8i,1582166168.0,What type of diet do you do and how did you get yourself to start eating healthier? You look fantastic btw! :)) It can be difficult to stay on track but it also feels really great to take good care of your body and feed it nutritious foods! 8)
