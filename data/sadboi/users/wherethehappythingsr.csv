Psychonaut,etsto2u,t1_etstaz5,1563155235.0,"My mom had a psychotic melt down the day I moved out of my house 

 due to my landlord confiscating my keys 10 days prior to rent due 

When I notified him of my boss screwing me on 3 weeks of undocumented work. About four weeks now at this point..

She's had it up to here with me and I've always felt like a giant bother to her(she makes it abundantly clear).  No father in the picture but he's alive and reachable. No relationship. Haven't talked to my grandma in years and it breaks my fucking heart but she doesn't understand me or people and is very bigoted and toxic as hell sometimes. It's easier to stay away. 

Even if I came back saying they were right it would be a toldja so and I'd be out on the street like I am even though they always preached ""We're the only family you got!"""

Psychonaut,etss5wr,t1_etsqjax,1563154022.0,"Been in 3 psych centers over 4 months as at 15.  


 I really would like a halfway home but honestly I would like a 3 month residential to help me get into an entirely different swing of things. I guess that's the same thing?  I just would love a community of healers (I also do reiki and sound healing) so a whole group of shamans and progressive thinking folks to help cultivate these good ideas.  


Just got done reading about folks in Denver who get mushroom and ket therapy. I'd love that coupled with some sort of support system but everything around here is opiate based it seems.   


No insurance currently."
Psychonaut,etsr31f,t1_egywfgq,1563153155.0,">erience talking, but I feel like BPD is very heavily tied in with trauma, which psychs are notorious for being pretty good at uncovering and aiding in processing. I think the ""no psychs for mental conditions"" is too broad - I specifically wouldn't recommend them for somebody who frequently deals with paranoia or disconnect from reality/psychosis (again I'm not an expert, take with some grains of salt). I've personally found that they can exacerbate dissociative symptoms for me in the months after taking high doses, but everybody is different and I may just have been too flippant about it.

Mind elaborating on your lsd thoughts? I feel the same way about fungus over chemicals besides ket."

This is a big big world and I feel like there's lots of places. I want to find my psychonaut friendly fit."
Psychonaut,etrxixc,t1_etrtmpr,1563131380.0,"At the surface yes. But I have a terrible experience of searching for this help.  
When I was younger in and out of the hospitals for harm, I talked about meditation and astral projection OBE all without drugs as a 15 year old.  


My mom told me that that was just an escape and I was getting high still by doing that?  


So I'm convinced that if I go somewhere, I'll either a.) get bare minimum heroin-rehab help because that's prominent around here. b.) end up somewhere that won't let me out until I change my ideals or some place trying to invalidate my little self progress with Source."
