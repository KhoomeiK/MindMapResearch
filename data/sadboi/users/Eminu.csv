SelfAwarewolves,fqk7d52,t1_fqjzyz0,1589421559.0,"Legend has it that there was a time when Rome was under attack, the senators who ruled thought that the empire was in so much trouble that they needed to name a interim dictator. They named a man named Cincinnatus to be dictator for six months. Cincinnatus then took arms, vanquished the invading forces, and immediately gave up his position as dictator within 15 days.

The roman historian Livy wrote about this and it's widely accepted as part of history. However many parts of the story are believed to be exagération and even outright fabrication for the sake of making Cincinnatus look good. As a result he's sort of a roman Uber mench. 

Skipping forward to Rome's most famous dictator, Ceasar. Ceasar was a military leader and a very popular one too. He really played the political game and made all sorts of alliances with various other figures of his time. Eventually, once he had seized enough power, he marched on the capital and literally named himself dictator for life. But he was by no means the first to claim the title, or the last.

I hope this makes clear what they meant"

""Self-organization, also called (in the social sciences) spontaneous order, is a process where some form of overall order arises from local interactions between parts of an initially disordered system. The process can be spontaneous when sufficient energy is available, not needing control by any external agent. It is often triggered by seemingly random fluctuations, amplified by positive feedback. The resulting organization is wholly decentralized, distributed over all the components of the system. As such, the organization is typically robust and able to survive or self-repair substantial perturbation. Chaos theory discusses self-organization in terms of islands of predictability in a sea of chaotic unpredictability."""
