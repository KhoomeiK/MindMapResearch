MTB,fr4vhhl,t1_fqhstbf,1589897655.0,Thanks op for bringing this up. I have a 2x (salsa journeyman) and am trying to figure this out. I live in Kansas so im basically always riding flats and fast. I find myself using the 5 smallest cogs (of 8) in the rear and my larger chain ring in the front basically all the time. I sometimes have to use the the small shift on my front derailleur where the guide is to stop it from rubbing a little. Does this sound right? I'm finding that I don't have to worry about cross chaining as much with a 2x

gravelcycling,fqvhhtm,t1_fqvh4ki,1589677370.0,"Thanks, I'm usually a hiker and needed something to keep my legs moving without ruining my knees. Also met some bikepackers while on the AZT and thought I'd try out a light touring bike. A couple shops here were pretty rude to me about buying it from REI haha, so I'm looking for somewhere to take it for servicing and also grab some bags and other gear."
gravelcycling,fqvgr1w,t1_fqvgmkr,1589676920.0,I just looked up redbud. I'm by Clearwater so its a little far for me but I'll have to check it out with all this time on my hands. üëç

gravelcycling,fqhkqav,t1_fqhctzq,1589378949.0,"Yeah I did the measurements via youtube video best I could. Used a couple other methods too and everything seems fine. I think its just part of being short haha. I'm 5'4 with a 28 inseam. My standover is very close, but I'm not sure I could move my seatpost up any further. I have the same angle at my knee that I've been shredding away a stationary bike at for years so it feels like good form. I'd also hate to go through the return process of a bike with REI haha"
gravelcycling,fqg6v9r,t1_fqfcnaw,1589339245.0,Just got it today. I love everything about itbut I ordered the small and I'm a bit worried I should've got the xs. When calling them they recommended a small. I have the seat post all the way down and my form seems fine but I'm finding mixed info about how it should fit. I'm only 5'4 so it was iffy whether to order the s or xs.
BecomingTheIceman,fqbwz2w,t3_gho6d7,1589245574.0,"You know, I started putting pressure on myself to keep using the app and tracking progress. I was always breaking through 3 minutes by round 2. I haven't been doing the method as much recently and i think it's because I've been viewing it as a chore. I think I'll go this approach instead and just do what feels right."
gravelcycling,fq7ediw,t3_gh31d2,1589145297.0,Wow solid. I'm south of Wichita dreaming of hills. Not much here besides farm roads and a little rail trail.
gravelcycling,fq4q1ty,t1_fpy88jg,1589081538.0,"Nice, I couldn't find one cheaper here in Wichita. REI had it on sale for a steal. You've got some nice places to ride up there yeah? Wichita area doesn't have much. Was just going to use our rail trail west of town and add some dirt road miles. Can't trust farmer Bob and Joe out where I am to ride very much pavement. I've been watching bikepacking YouTube videos and really hoping this develops a future in bike packing to alternate with thru hiking."
gravelcycling,fpxle2k,t1_fpxktqi,1588984777.0,"Good to hear I made the right choice being new to this. The bike should be here in a week, so far just got a water bottle cage and might order a top tube bag to make some longer days away from the house."
PacificCrestTrail,fpdhzye,t3_gcemlx,1588527366.0,A hiker named The Duck or Ducky or something pissed right next to my face on the CDT last year when I was cowboy camping at Doc Campbell's. He was also facing the families (with little kids) house and the bathroom was about 30 yards away. I woke up to the smell and had to scoot over to avoid getting splashed on..
CDT,fpd7ykw,t1_fpamd7j,1588521695.0,I think this is the best worded description of any reasoning behind cancelling a thru hike this year.
Thruhiking,fp9yuhh,t1_fp9qb9t,1588437388.0,"Nord-east's link is a great start. When I started hiking I was watching youtube videos, most trails have been vlogged by somebody. The reason I chose the CT as my first hike is because I had lived in CO and was familiar with the area. I found it fascinating to revisit places I day hiked and drove by previously, so you may have that same connection to somewhere."
Thruhiking,fp9ksx4,t3_gc1qg9,1588428694.0,"Keep looking around and choose what seems to pull you. Theres a lot of great places to start, like the Colorado Trail or Arizona trail, or even shorter things like the JMT, Wonderland, or Ouachita. But it means a lot more to build a natural fascination with a hike than have someone sell you on their experience of something."
CDT,fon656v,t1_fon6001,1587913080.0,"Yes, I know this, I'm very familiar with the state and that's why I'm waiting to make a decision. Thanks."

CDT,fokppll,t3_g7go8f,1587846588.0,"Im holding onto hope but also worried that during a long trail something will happen. And it just doesn't even feel right to be planning it right now. Backup plan is moving into my truck for a summer in CO, which may not even be likely. I hope I'm wrong"
Thruhiking,fny31yl,t1_fnx8r8c,1587352199.0,"I live in Kansas and have gone to MO often during the summer. I can't imagine hiking this mid summer but if I did, I wouldn't put dogs through that."
Thruhiking,fnwrfpp,t3_g4aeul,1587323978.0,Is July a good time to hike that trail? I thought fall or early spring was better.
CDT,fnuncne,t1_fntfizj,1587266244.0,"I couldn't agree more. I know a handful of people that did it as not only their first thru hike, but first time backpacking. Good research, a few shakedowns, and a little advice from others willing to share a few things is all it took to help them make it happen."
arizonatrail,fn1xz21,t3_fyonsv,1586572835.0,"I know of hikers starting at that time. Will be cold not only on the rim but a few places down south, and would need to be prepared for some snowfall if you're passing through mountain ranges come mid-November. Its hard to answer not knowing what'll happen weather wise, but sobo in the fall is a beautiful AZT experience regardless."
CDT,fmexmgs,t1_fmexiox,1586015729.0,Right hahaha..
CDT,fmex9o5,t3_fqfpzi,1586015511.0,"Im holding onto a sobo still but only if the CDT coalition, trail communities, and national parks are all on the same page about it. I'm baffled that there's still hikers out there despite what's going on."
arizonatrail,fmacddr,t1_fm9xfyy,1585889678.0,"I'm assuming all states holding these trails will adopt this? I hope so. I cant believe the selfish behavior amongst hikers out there right now. PCT and AT are still seeing a lot of hikers as well from what I understand. Getting spanked with a fine ought to wake them up, if getting doors slammed in their faces doesnt."
arizonatrail,fm2loxe,t1_fm2kw2r,1585700060.0,Yeah and I have some idea that the support van doesn't have its own farm inside to produce its own food. They've played the victim card of harassment but they don't understand the badge they're about to wear for the future.
arizonatrail,fm2jlmx,t1_fm2iwul,1585698798.0,"Yep, and their sponsors as well. One guy claims they're staying near the van but their public messages say they're on a 30 day stretch with ""nearly zero contact"" with trail communities. I'd hate to see the future support from entire trail communities change because of something like this."
arizonatrail,fm2gbp5,t1_fm0xqlf,1585696914.0,"The group of 9 hiking the GWL is in AZ. Theyre refusing to stop hiking and blocking anyone and deleting comments. I hope they see this and finally make a good decision (at this point it's beyond late). They claim being supported by a van and hiking through remote locations makes it okay for them to continue. Im glad most of the community is together on this one, but I'm baffled at the people that are selfish enough to keep hiking...."
CDT,fm1scrg,t3_frey6m,1585684140.0,Im holding onto a sobo but anything is good at this point. The combo of not being on trail and not working just feels wrong.
CDT,fm1oc51,t1_fm00y7g,1585682066.0,I just crapped my pants
PacificCrestTrail,fls65wu,t1_fls5tgr,1585435191.0,"I agree. Hikers keep finding loopholes. They think they're playing chess or something, justifying their choice to keep hiking. The same effort and finances put into a thru can easily be used to get off trail and quarantine.  I've heard every excuse in the book from the group on the GWL, and have been blocked. Its a whole new breed of selfishness in the hiking community."
PacificCrestTrail,fls477m,t1_fls2eiw,1585433992.0,There's a FB page for hikers that are still hiking despite all this? Wow...
PacificCrestTrail,flrkp8j,t1_flr8xwi,1585422193.0,"I agree. Still holding onto my CDT sobo as well, but it'll probably be post poned if things don't improve by summer. And that's okay. I think this explains more that the PCTA is faced with a problem with permits in the future, which somehow justifies not taking action during a global pandemic right NOW. In a lot of America this is the mentality. Wait and see what happens, god forbid someone lose miles or miss out on that social media fame just because thousands are dying due to a widespread virus right?"
arizonatrail,flf7s6r,t3_fohl5x,1585099958.0,The entire hiking community is begging people NOT to hike and get off trail if already on trail. Communities will be on lockdown and national parks will close and trails will close as well. It is absolutely a terrible idea to start a thru hike right now.
arizonatrail,fl1ydpc,t3_flvkpr,1584738907.0,You made the right decision. It isn't responsible to be thru hiking right now for many reasons. The trail will always be there.
CoronavirusUS,fl1wrl9,t1_fl141b3,1584737921.0,"Update : my boss at work AND the temp agency told me that regardless of what the government and media say, we will be expected to be at work.. This may be where I lose my job"
CoronavirusUS,fl0b549,t1_fkz12xn,1584699664.0,"It seems to be a hard decision for some companies because of money flow but what really irritates me is this is a family owned lumber mill. Everyone at work is in denial about the virus, claiming even if we get it we will be able to come to work. I don't think anyone understands how serious that this is. Its a rough decision but at some point I'm going to have to choose to quit, probably before the company closes. I agree, we need to quarantine now rather than even a week later. It would make a huge difference. The stubbornness and ignorance of people is whats going to make this much worse."
CoronavirusUS,fkyxors,t1_fkyxi52,1584658352.0,Ridiculous. I don't understand.
arizonatrail,fjbqk5g,t1_fjb4paz,1583199243.0,"Also Marney in Oracle is a great TA and can get you in/out of town. Might save some money there vs buying food up at Summerhaven. She might even let you get a shower or do laundry at the chalet, her and her husband are awesome people."
arizonatrail,fjb47yp,t3_fci7uh,1583186156.0,"I didn't end up needing to resupply at summer haven. Resupplied in Vail and then Oracle. Didn't ever need to send a box anywhere, although Roosevelt would be the place. Could hitch to Tonto though, or see the trail angel named Bobby on the AZT website list and arrange a ride. Other than that I shopped in towns and always found what I needed. Make sure you go to the Safeway in Vail it's better than the other little store uphill."
CannabisHyperemesis,fil90a9,t1_fil8v3h,1582496282.0,"For me to have very little to no symptoms, a big hit or two in the evenings, but not really every evening. I start having slight stomach aches if I smoke a full bowl or more a day (usually in one sitting) and having no self control this usually turns into much more than that hahaha."
CannabisHyperemesis,fil82p0,t3_f8f6i6,1582495693.0,"I had mild symptoms for years not knowing what it was. In my experiences using small amounts several times a week (not every day) didn't ever cause a huge episode but did cause discomfort in the morning. Everyone seems to be affected differently. I know a few folks that were hospitalized for an attack but eventually went back to using small amounts, still having slight stomach aches in the morning and puking a few times a month. Nothing compared to the violent episodes some people go through."
arizonatrail,fiaolcg,t3_f7bmdj,1582305326.0,I hope you find someone! Might consider hitching south people are pretty cool with that in AZ.

arizonatrail,fi5f917,t1_fi57ky6,1582161799.0,"Even without them I found that natural water sources and tanks were typically spaced well enough that I only relied on them, and found it a pleasant surprise when I did come across public caches. There were lots of sources not listed on guthooks that weren't very far off trail at all. This was sobo after an extremely dry summer/monsoon season."
arizonatrail,fi52iy7,t1_fi52evd,1582153508.0,"Super odd, close to the border and Tucson a few public caches were stabbed with a knife at the bottom. Not sure who or why but that is something to consider :("
arizonatrail,fi52evd,t3_f694bs,1582153438.0,Likely not necessary. Some people do it. I often was able to find water where guthooks said it was dry recently by looking around a bit in the general area. Also as a sobo water caches were pretty well stocked.

arizonatrail,fi1uleb,t3_f5zdj9,1582065094.0,"20 is solid for the whole trail. My coldest nights were in the southern half of the state, as you'll be crossing several mountain ranges even after you drop off of the plateau. Only had a few pretty warm nights, one of those being at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. I was told leaving pine it would get a lot warmer, which some days do particularly between superior and Mt.
