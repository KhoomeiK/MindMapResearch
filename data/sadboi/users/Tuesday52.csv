meToo,foimxhq,t3_g7f2cy,1587790834.0,"Honestly, I don't think so but everyone is different. I was spanked a half a dozen times in my childhood and I deserved it(probably 30 minutes before I was spanked).  My father has slapped me upside the head but I was being a dumbass. Now(I'm 33), both of my parents have patted my bottom, whether in a loving way or when I was in high school and showing a thong. My parents never abused me, I grew up even showering with them in a completely consensual, no sexual way(until I was probably 10?). But if it doesn't make you comfortable, they should respect that."
