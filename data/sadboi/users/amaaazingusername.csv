Like last month I took our 3 year old on an overseas trip to meet my biological relatives. He didn‚Äôt want her to go. I said ok, I don‚Äôt have to bring her, but I‚Äôd really really like to and it means a lot to me. And he agreed, came with me to get her passport, etc. Now he says I took her against his will. And it‚Äôs so weird, like he is changing the history of what happened...when that is NOT what happened. I would NEVER take one of the kids out of the country without his consent. It‚Äôs making me feel like I‚Äôve gone crazy. So I guess my worry stems from that...the idea of ‚Äútaking his kids away‚Äù and then being really mad.

But Jesus, it‚Äôs just a party at their cousins house 20 mins away. I‚Äôm well within my rights to bring them there."

I‚Äôll take photos in different lighting to confirm the flaws. I‚Äôve tried to limit it to just a couple of photos a day now. I still do mirror checking too :(

I‚Äôm absolutely sure I have BDD, but I‚Äôve recently been wondering if I have OCD as well. I now recognize that before the BDD I had different obsessions, all starting immediately after the birth of my youngest child 3 years ago (so probably postpartum OCD).I‚Äôd love to get a formal diagnosis but have no money for therapy (hopefully soon). I wonder if BDD and OCD are related somehow. My obsessions changed over time, I am no longer fixated on the things I was. BDD is the worst by far, I am somewhat hopeful that it is just my latest obsession and that will eventually change...but it has lasted much longer than the others did so I‚Äôm not so sure :-/

How long did you have the OCD before BDD symptoms?"
BodyDysmorphia,f6xduxv,t1_f6x751n,1573247591.0,"Wow are you me?

I‚Äôm currently obsessing over getting fillers in the next few days, before an overseas trip to meet some long lost relatives. Every time I look in the mirror I panic. I‚Äôve been crying a lot, which does NOT help eye bags, strangely enough.

Aging related BDD is super sucky. Because it‚Äôs true...these changes might be exaggerated in our minds, but they really are happening and only get worse. I have no idea how to accept the changes. 

Very sorry you are dealing with this. It helps to hear I‚Äôm not alone in this <3 Hope you feel better soon."
BodyDysmorphia,f6wj67b,t3_dtei76,1573227809.0,"35 here and right there with you. I‚Äôve aged dramatically in the past year. I‚Äôve lost a ton of facial volume. Now I have eye bags. I went to get a consult for fillers and the doctor recommended getting lower eyelid surgery. So that just confirmed to me how bad they look. 

To make things worse, I now have a smile line on the right side Of my mouth. It‚Äôs huge! Like an inch long. It literally wasn‚Äôt there 4 weeks ago. I know it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve lost volume in my upper face, so I‚Äôm starting to get nasolabial folds. 

The worst thing is my hands. My hands looked young like they always have until 6 months ago. Now they are bulging with veins and my fingers are wrinkly. It‚Äôs such a dramatic difference. Part of the problem is that i have very low body fat. But it‚Äôs just excruciating to me...my hands look 20 years older and I‚Äôm reminded any time I look down at them. I‚Äôm even considering having the veins removed, which my husband thinks is batshit crazy. 

Anyways, you aren‚Äôt alone :( I used to seriously not care about how I looked. I barely even used to check the mirror before I left the house. Now I feel obsessed with the changes in my appearance :( Like I‚Äôve lost my ‚Äúlooks‚Äù (not that I was even ever that good looking lol) forever. It kind of feels like disassociation...due to the changes on my face and hands  I‚Äôm no longer myself. :("

(Please don‚Äôt consider suicide. Suicide prevention has an online chat)

In my mind I‚Äôm still 25. My body feels 25 too. I mean I just feel the same as I always have. And I even still look young for my age. But I‚Äôve noticed so many gray hairs. And my hands are looking older. And am I getting under eye bags? It‚Äôs freaking me out. 

I look around at older people and I‚Äôm terrified. Even though I have lots of examples of fit, happy, active, older people in my life. My my aunt is 59 and is stronger than me! Her husband is 72 and runs their farm!

I never really thought about aging. That‚Äôs what happens to other people. Not ME. But here I am, with multiplying gray hairs. It does not make sense. There is no going back, this is for real. I can‚Äôt cope with the fact I am going to get old. 

It‚Äôs very illogical. My mom died in her early 60‚Äôs from MS. I survived a terrible illness that could have disabled me for life or killed me. A friend from high school died in her 20‚Äôs of brain cancer. All of my kids and husband are alive and healthy and thriving. The future looks bright financially. We are planning one more baby, world travel, and hopefully many grandchildren one day! 

But here I am, moping about like an emo teenager about a condition that literally affects every single person on earth (if they are lucky). Living in a time when healthcare is better than at any point in human history, in a first world country where I have the luxury of eating the healthiest food. 

But still, I am pretty devastated about aging. I feel as though I am losing my identity, my very self. And the truth is I will lose those things, and even my very life. And there is no way to stop it. 

So basically, this really sucks.  

Guess I‚Äôm going to start wearing all black and listening death metal."

ExistentialSupport,eucg9ks,t3_cfqgbi,1563674227.0,"Wow I could have written this post. I‚Äôve been going through the same thing lately. I used to just blithely go around my life worrying about meal planning and pantry organization. Doing artwork and dreaming of travel. But something hit me a few months ago. I think it was a combination of things :

1.	‚Å†My eldest kiddo is about to turn 11. He‚Äôs going to middle school in the fall. He‚Äôs not my little toddler anymore. I love him to death, he‚Äôs the sweetest kid ever, but I just can‚Äôt wrap my mind around the idea that he is growing up. I mean it‚Äôs super cliche, but it literally feels like he was a baby yesterday. My other 3 kids are growing up fast too. My youngest is turning 3, and it seems like time has gone by way too quickly.
2.	‚Å†I am turning 35 next week. My hands look older. I don‚Äôt know what happened, they just changed. They are all veiny all of a sudden. I swear my hands looked young 6 months ago, and now they just aren‚Äôt.  I guess I‚Äôve been lucky looking young for my age and I never really thought about getting older. Maybe I could get a cosmetic treatment or something but that‚Äôs not the point. Im not going to be younger again. Time is limited. That I will grow old and die. That my kids will be without me and my husband.

The world will go on turning and we will be forgotten. All those beautiful moments holding my kids and being with my husband ...it will be like they never happened. It fucking sucks. Life is such an unfair deal.

How can we be happy knowing we can‚Äôt be with our loved ones forever? I already lost my mom when I was 28. I miss her so much. She had a terrible illness that progressed far (MS) and really she was mentally gone by the time I was 20. Where is the bright side and silver lining to that? I can never see her again. The same will happen to me sooner or later....whether I get cancer, am hit by a bus, or die in my sleep age 100.

I get that some people see this positively. Like life is beautiful but limited so live in the movement and enjoy every day etc. Money / possessions don‚Äôt matter etc etc. But how do experiences even matter? We can‚Äôt keep those either.

So yeah, I‚Äôm crying every day. Clinging to my kiddos and husband and honestly just very sad.
I wish I never started thinking about this and could just enjoy life again. I wish I was the kind of person that just believed in whatever religion and was content.

So my husband and I are planning to have one last baby. But now I feel bad for bringing another kid into an existence like this. Even though they will be born into a first world country with a big, loving, financially stable family and will have excellent health care and schools (pretty ideal circumstances imo) still I feel bad! They will have to suffer as well. :(

Please let me know if you find a way out of this. I tried Zoloft and it didn‚Äôt help me. I‚Äôm not sure how anything could. I hope you feel better soon <3"

I didn‚Äôt realize it would be so jarring getting braces as an adult! Also I am turning 35 and somewhat panicking about aging üòÇ"
PlasticSurgery,etuorwk,t1_etulwhx,1563216935.0,"No I‚Äôve actually lost weight, I‚Äôm only 102 pounds (from 108). I can‚Äôt tell if my face has actually changed shape or if my smile is just awkward at the moment. 

I think I have lost volume in my upper face (I have eye bags when I didn‚Äôt before). I guess I was wondering if I got cheek fillers if it would lift up my jawline a bit."
Existential_crisis,eqxtxzf,t1_eqxpqwx,1560373885.0,"Thank you for this amazing response. I really appreciate it. 

I guess it‚Äôs more fear of them eventually not needing me. My youngest is 2 and we will have one more...but eventually of course they all grow up. This is something I‚Äôll eventually have to accept. Maybe I am just dealing with it much earlier than an empty-nester. 

Maybe I‚Äôm having trouble accepting my mortality. Maybe it‚Äôs because my mom died when I was young (28 but was mentally gone with I was 18 due to Multiple Sclerosis). maybe it‚Äôs because I was adopted and adult haven‚Äôt met my bio dad (he lives in Israel, found him 2 years ago and I‚Äôm going to visit in the fall).

I definitely need to work on having a purpose outside of just kids. Before kids I just wanted to travel the world, play video games, make video games, create art, and be with my husband. Maybe I can do some of those things. I have no time for ANY of that now, so maybe that has contributed to me feeling like I have no other purpose or happiness other than kids.  It‚Äôs my only identity now. 

Thanks again, sorry for the ramble."
therapy,eqxdh0u,t1_eqwhypp,1560367934.0,"Thanks I‚Äôll call around. I‚Äôm hoping once his surgery is done we will meet our ‚Äúmax‚Äù and I‚Äôll be able to go to therapy for free for a few months üëçüèº 

Betterhelp is too much for me right now :/ Maybe once my husband‚Äôs promotion is in effect."
depression,eqt9g24,t3_anh7tv,1560305891.0,"Bad day overall. I cried like 10 times.

I managed to make dinner for my family, so that‚Äôs a positive. I also put away some laundry. I played games with all of my kids. I spent time outside. I took the meds I‚Äôm trying (SAM-E...some natural thing my mom gave me). 

But damn. I felt sad and tired all day. Even though everything in my life is going well. For gods sakes my husband just agreed to have another baby (like I wanted) and he just got a huge promotion (so we will be much more financially secure!). What is wrong with me??? I am trying to hide my swollen eyes from my kids because I can‚Äôt stop crying."
raisedbynarcissists,eqqcd1i,t3_bz1522,1560217771.0,"Omg yes. I had a serious, rare, life threatening illness two years ago. I was hospitalized twice, couldn‚Äôt walk. It was pretty intense.

Just the other day nmom started going on about how it had been traumatizing for her, and how it was crazy I had to go through that and she had to go through LYME DISEASE.  (She uses ‚Äúchronic Lyme‚Äù as an attention getting strategy. Whenever things aren‚Äôt going her way she magically gets bit by a tick again and needs to go to a special doctor).  Yes nmom, just as bad as my illness. Wow."
30PlusSkinCare,eqe6gq9,t1_eq4gpqd,1559999950.0, I‚Äôve seen studies that retin a actually thickens the skin...is it different on hands?
30PlusSkinCare,eqe6cp9,t1_epsdal8,1559999909.0,"Thank you for this reply. I‚Äôm going to pick up some of that fancy lotion and have myself some mid-day pampering :) I‚Äôve started doing my exact face routine on my hands, hopefully it helps with texture at least!"
30PlusSkinCare,eqe6731,t1_epo6kdw,1559999852.0,"I don‚Äôt know if I have the guts to try that on my hands!! My veins are so close to the surface lol, seems like I would be puncturing them..."
30PlusSkinCare,eqe5z3p,t1_eqcd1tw,1559999772.0,"I don‚Äôt know about thick skin hands...but I‚Äôm sure spf would help prevent. 

Hmm everything I‚Äôve read seems to say exercise just makes veins worse! I was just at the doctor and I weigh less than ever (102 pounds) so I think that I‚Äôve just lost any fat that was on my hands. I‚Äôm hopefully gaining some weight will help a bit..."
TTC30,eqe5kc7,t3_by6xtn,1559999623.0,"I‚Äôm very anxious to TTC this fall! My husband is getting a vasectomy reversal. I‚Äôm 34 but will be 35 at the end of next month, so I guess the ‚Äúadvanced maternal age‚Äù thing is getting under my skin. But this will be baby #5, so Hopefully everything will go smoothly. We‚Äôve always conceived extremely quickly, but who knows if things will be different now that I‚Äôm older or if the reversal will be effective üò¨"
30PlusSkinCare,epnsvqo,t1_epnk7i4,1559332751.0,"They might have and I just don‚Äôt remember. To be fair though, I‚Äôve ordered my latest batch from India online, so it‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve seen a derm. 

Def worth it :).  And much easier to give up tret than ibuprofen üò© lol"
30PlusSkinCare,epmv7my,t1_epmsy50,1559317846.0,"Wow I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd have to stop my beloved tretinoin! At least pregnancy should stop the acne during that time. Thanks for the heads up...we aren‚Äôt TTC for 2 months, but looks like I need to stop retin a 1 whole month beforehand! Very good to know üëçüèº"
30PlusSkinCare,epmv0zx,t1_epmosec,1559317781.0,"Aww thanks :) 

Wow the gloves are a great idea! My husband is going to laugh so hard at me üòÇ"
30PlusSkinCare,epmmw74,t1_epmlgbj,1559315055.0,"Yeah I can‚Äôt imagine spending so much on hand filler...I was looking at before and afters and wasn‚Äôt really impressed tbh. I don‚Äôt really have that budget anyways, i would also prioritize my face. 

I‚Äôm planning a pregnancy, so that‚Äôs probably not going to help with the veins either lol... although at least my hands should be slightly more plump for a year. 

I was actually just googling and found ‚Äúsclerotherapy‚Äù where a doctor removes the veins. Not sure about that though, seems kinda drastic."
