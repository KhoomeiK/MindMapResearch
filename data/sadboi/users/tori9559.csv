AskReddit,fbtgvb2,t3_ee3b1i,1577078427.0,"This is my first time writing it all out so here we go.

TLDR: My dying cousin allegedly tried to sleep with my then boyfriend.

I was about 20 and had been dating a guy for about 3 years. He was incredibly mentally and verbally abusive. Of course, at that time, i hadnt noticed it, or at least, i hadnt grown the courage to finally leave. He would manipulate me into thinking its okay that he go on vacations with girls i knew he was interested in, told me that women should never have been given voting rights, threatened to tell my family about a miscarriage I had recently had, etc. But i still loved him and i wanted to marry him anyway. 

My cousin and i had been close since birth. Shes 2 years younger than me. Shes always been quirky and awkward, but so was i. We would convince people we were twins and make up dances with each other, like normal kid stuff. Then in highschool she got sick and never got better. She has some sort of disease that im not sure the name of. Something where she gets so tired, cant eat without becoming painfully sick,  had to have her uterus removed and a port installed into her chest so she could get medicine easier. She was pulled from school freshman year and never allowed to go back again, therefore never getting the chance to make any friends or develop social skills. It was around that time where i also started doing my own thing and didnt talk to her as much. Looking back, i know thats where a lot of resentment between us began and I take full responsibility for that.

There was one night where i was out with some coworkers at a dinner and i called my boyfriend to see what he was up to and heard a girl in the back. I asked who it was and it was my cousin. I was weirded out. Why were they together? They had met a few times at family get togethers and got along but had never hung out to my knowledge. I exploded in anger and confusion. My cousin texts me explaining that she had mutilated her arms and then needed someone to drive her to the store to get more long sleeves to hide it grin her parents. I asked her why she didn't ask me and she said it was because im always busy and dont reply back to her all the time. Which is true. I immediately feel so much guilt but am still angry that this was all behind my back. Why call your older cousins boyfriend for this of all people? Thats weird. But then again who else does she know? Ive seen her phone contact list, it's like 10 people who are all adult family members. I try my best to get over it, but it breeds some sort of bitterness in both of us.

Then maybe a week later when im still extremely angry about the situation, my boyfriend tells me that theres something he didnt tell me about that night. She had asked him to take her to an adult sex store to buy herself a dildo. He apparently said no. She then asked ""if you werent dating my cousin, would you have sex with me?"" He apparently said no to that also. She also asked if he would go into the back seat with her for ""fun"". After finding this out, i am repulsed. So much so that I finally break up with him and stop talking to my cousin for months. Not at family gatherings, not over text, nothing.

But then her condition worsens. I get the news that she probably wont make it another few years. Shes in terrible shape and is depressed and suicidal. She finally texts me and asks why we havent talked. I tell her because im hurt by what she did and she is apparently clueless to what im referring to. I tell her what i was told she did and she is shocked and denies everything. She starts going off on me saying that im a terrible person for believing someone else over her and that she would never do that and to never talk to her ever again. She was so angry...

Looking back now, i realize how abusive my boyfriend was. He loved control over me. Loved me being jealous over all the girls he said were so interested in him. He could have lied. Its possible. And i know that now. But at the same time, my cousin had made odd comments to him before in front of me. Things like ""would it be weird if we texted."" Or ""can i sit by him at dinner (my boyfriend)."" Just little things here and there that i look back on now that make me think she had taken interest in the only boy that came around her that wasnt a family member. And when i brought it up to her she refused to talk it out and instead just blew up on me for even saying it and told me to not talk to her.

I dont know what to think or who to believe. Shes dying and im not sure how long she has left. I feel this immense guilt in me which isnt helped by the fact that our whole family knows now (she told her parents who told my grandparents, etc.) I offered to get together to talk it out but she refused. Now shes too sick to leave the house. I think my aunt blames me for her unhappiness. Its all a mess. Im not sure what else to say about it...."
AskReddit,fbtem3r,t1_fbotaf3,1577076288.0,"For a moment, it sounded as if you could have been my aunt. My cousin is 19 years old and has a disease that cant seem to be cured. Im not sure the exact name, but something where she cant eat and gets really tired, to put it lightly. She has a port installed into her chest to get medication to her heart easier. My aunt stays home all day to take care of her. Doesnt work, doesnt have friends, doesnt go out. I think she even gets grocceries delivered so she doesnt even get out to do that. She has been for years. About a decade now. She used to be this amazing, happy, bright woman. As a kid, i clung onto her. Now, shes different. Bitter and angry. She snaps at me the few times a year she comes around. I feel so bad because i know shes just protecting her daughter who is expected to die soon now... i think she has some sort of resentment towards myself because im only a few years older than my cousin and have had (all things considered) a normal and social life while her daughter was pulled from school as a freshman in highschool and never allowed back, therefore never being given the chance to make any friends or develop any social skills. Theyre both so lonely, i can feel it. I know my cousin wants to die. I can feel that too. I guess my point is that you seem so strong in the fact that youre trying your hardest to not become bitter.
