depression,fqnww1g,t3_gjjnzd,1589503003.0,"This is a mood. I had to start back to work yesterday and it is so mentally and physically draining. I basically didn't talk to anyone for the majority of my shift yesterday. Just being out of the house somewhere I can't escape from took so much energy out of me. I thought back to my days of working 12-hour shifts at my last job and I don't know how I managed it without killing anyone (even though I will admit that I thought about it).

&#x200B;

I'd love to be able to just stay home with my cat and my fiancee and not have to worry about going places where I am expected to be a functioning human being and socialize with people I don't even know, or even care to socialize with. I've been trying to find a work at home job so I can make this dream a reality."

Dissociation,fno0hwl,t3_g2ucvr,1587107673.0,"OP I'll be your friend if you need one. I struggle with bad anxiety and (undiagnosed) PTSD (long story I can share later if you are interested) along with depression. I understand what you are going though. Being trapped at home is bringing up memories of a similar situation when I was younger and all the feelings I was going through then. Our brains make weird connections and tries to protect us in the strangest ways possible.

When I disassociate focusing on something I can physically touch, or feel against my skin, helps. In your case maybe try and provoke some happy memories. Look at old pictures with friends. Watch old YouTube videos that make you smile and remember how they used to make you feel. Hopefully it can help bring back that sense of self that dissociation tends to take away from us.

My DMs are always open and I will try to respond as quickly as I can if you feel the want/need to reach out."
medicalmarijuana,fnnzvdv,t3_g2pyqj,1587107065.0,"My dispensery sells rechargeable stick pens for the oil cartridges they sell for $10-$15. 

As for dry herb, I picked up a Snoop Dogg G-Pen at my local gas station for $20. It hits well. It has a little bit of heat up time when you press the fire button, but nothing too bad. Only gripe is you get resin build up. It's small so it looks like a lot, but no more than a pipe would have in it. It is recommended you turn the bowl about every 2-4 hits. It helps, trust me. I'd say go with Snoop for it for dry herb. It's easy to use, comes with cleaning tools, and a charger all in the package with the G-Pen."

questioning,fdpyncp,t3_em1ica,1578646226.0,"It is totally normal to feel like this. I am polyamorous and it took me a while to realize that is what was happening. I kept getting crushes on multiple people while I was in high school and didn't think it was fair that if I wanted to date someone I had to pick just one. It wasn't until I met my fiance/e and they explained to me what it was like to be polyamorous and the feelings that came with it that I knew that is what I was all along.  All the times I felt trapped in a way in monogamous relationships made sense. The times I had to suppress how I felt about some of my close friends and in turn a part of myself.

I wouldn't feel guilty about your feelings at all OP. It is natural to love or have strong feelings for many people. If it seems to become a reoccurring thing I would look into what it's like being poly. My DMs are open as well if you would like to talk. <3"
