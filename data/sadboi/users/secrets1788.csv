I was there to take care of our child, clean the house, do laundry, and make meals.

I‚Äôm not sure he ever asked me how my day was. Like for real. 

I remember when I dated someone after that- this person consistently asked me how I was everyday and talked to me about my days and my feelings‚Äî- I literally jumped his bones every time I saw him. Like I wanted to please him sexually and he turned me on so much. 

For me, if someone treats me as just anyone or doesn‚Äôt treat me as important or unique to them‚Äî I will be 100% turned off.

The thought of my ex husband sexually makes me ill seriously. 

So yeah, I do think it comes down to such a simple thing‚Äî actual connection as woman and man. And I feel like women are usually more open to connection and fixing a bad one... 

Also, I don‚Äôt want to be your mom in mom role‚Äî cooking, cleaning, etc.

I want to be a woman and in my wild woman ways. Treat me like that and I‚Äôm yours.

Treat me like your mom and I‚Äôm out and absolutely not sleeping with you- that is disgusting.

I see your perspective as a stepmom and I‚Äôve always tried to put myself in that mindset but I‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs been a detriment and not helpful‚Äî and that I‚Äôm actually damaging my son by doing that. 

I wish her happy holidays , I let my son pick gifts for her, I text her and say congrats for certain events, etc. I‚Äôve always tried to be inclusive and be sensitive to the situation. 

I commented this to another poster above:  

‚ÄúThe reason I haven't said anything so far is because I have tried to be rational, see things from her perspective, and give her the benefit of the doubt. I've also tried to instill this in my son.  know that (aggressive) confrontation isn't helpful and I've also tried to tread lightly so not to inflame the situation if there were exaggerations going on. 

I've also tried to let time pass because he was younger, maybe there where issues within the relationship and she was projecting, maybe now it's because she's pregnant, etc etc etc 

But it's not getting better, it's getting worse. 

I know what kids are like and I know how my son is. But the issues are increasing here and my son literally does not have relational issues with anyone. Not with me, his dad, his teachers, any other family, or kids. He isn't that type of child. He IS a normal child though with normal tendencies to obviously not be perfect and to sometimes be annoying and he doesn't always listen. But the stories that have happened the way that he has described... I have confirmed with his dad over and over and over.... and my son is not lying. 

My son's dad said they fight constantly over her treatment of my son and he moved to a new state (before she was pregnant) to break up with her. She moved here, was supppper nice to my son for awhile to get back with my ex, and now is how she used to be again-- now that she is pregnant. So she does have some tendencies to be controlling. 

I know I'm biased because I don't like her (so many reasons, all have to do with her trying to control situations, telling me not to text or call my sons dad at all about our child, bringing my son to her moms house to watch him and refusing to give me her mothers emergency information even while her mother was not on our custody arrangement to watch our child, etc etc)

Despite all of that, I've still tried to give her the benefit of the doubt. But I also have a background in Psychology, teaching, and domestic violence, and I can say- the situation isn't good. I just don't have experience with being in this particular situation, however, and my emotions are high right now- I'm not sure how to navigate it.‚Äù

Also to add, there‚Äôs a reason why I‚Äôm not with my sons dad. He‚Äôs passive and also passive aggressive and he doesn‚Äôt get things done. I imagine living in a household with him is stressful for her but also- that animosity shouldn‚Äôt be taken out on my son."

I think they may be covering up what really happened but if what they say did happen- he could have made it look like an accident, too. They also worded things strange. 

There‚Äôs no record of what they say happened happening anywhere. No articles, no police reports... but there are articles and police reports of other situations- the same things but just not his. 

Also he had a specific picture up even like two weeks ago with this item in it that killed him (not a gun or knife or anything like that)... but he recently updated his website like within weeks, left all the pics, but took that one down. That was the missing clue that kindof solidified things to me. Like when he was gone, he didn‚Äôt want anyone to see that and speculate or to talk about it. 

I think his business was struggling due to covid and I don‚Äôt think he could distract himself like normal- no bars or friends or dating because of lock down. No parks- he was a very active person. Also, his bday was coming up and I suspect that his age caused him some grief with the fact that he was alone. 

I think this quarantine would have magnified that his feelings of loneliness. 

This is my intuitive feeling and we had a very close and spiritual connection. I‚Äôm not for certain though.

She‚Äôs done other readings for me before. She said it one life he and I were best friends- same sex. In another life, we were married- I was much younger by about 20 years but he was good to me and we were very in love. 

The good thing about this is that again, it‚Äôs opening my eyes and bringing me deeper. Lately I have been feeling like it‚Äôs time to step into my meaning and purpose.

Also to add to this, the day before we met, the winds and the sky was so weird. I remember feeling this very eerie feeling. It even looked strange, this very pink color. I remember feeling like I was on a movie and like it was leading up to something.

awakened,fq063bf,t1_fq01lwh,1589028025.0,"Do you think we are all preparing a new heaven and earth? Will there ever be a chance to actually be again in the same plane? 

Another strange thing, from the time I was 17 (I was 31 when I met him) I always said my mans name was LIKE his name but I didn‚Äôt know what it was for sure. It was hidden from me. Somehow I knew the general blend of letters because I had a dream about this at 17. 

But I ended up being off by one letter.

For an example, if the name was Steve but in your head you always thought your mans name would be LIKE Stef but you weren‚Äôt sure exactly what it would be. Like Stef but not actually that. 

For years and years, anytime I met anyone with even the slightest resemblance of this mix of letters, I wondered. When I was dating people who didn‚Äôt have this mix of letters, I knew they weren‚Äôt my fated person.

Strange enough, I almost named my sons middle name his first name. The first six months of my sons life (in my belly) his middle name was actually his first name. I changed it though when my sons dads gpa died and we used that middle name to honor him instead. 

Also, in my heart- I knew that my man would ask me to take a walk with him. Anybody I ever dated before this, it was kindof the test- if they didn‚Äôt ask me to take a walk or if I asked them and they declined- it was like this weird confirmation.

He asked me to take a walk 3x. And then there was his name. 

BUT I DIDNT SEE IT. 

It feels like I was purposely blinded by the universe and ‚Äúforgot‚Äù when I met him and we had our interaction, like I wasn‚Äôt supposed to know when we were together- only afterwards all this came rushing back. 

It was the weirdest thing. I feel like I was honestly given temporary amnesia purposely. 

Also, while we were laying there with him one night, barely knowing this person, in my head I thought ‚Äúthis is my man‚Äù. It was a very deep knowing. I never had that with anyone before and I‚Äôve never felt that with anyone before.

It sounds crazy but I truly believed we would ultimately end up together physically and have a child- he is 1/2 a different race and I‚Äôve had visions of having a baby girl of this race since I was also 17. 

I‚Äôm just so sad."
awakened,fpzycyz,t1_fpzt56x,1589025495.0,"Thank you. We met very suddenly, but the meet up prior to him led us straight together. So many synchronicities and ironies. There was nothing I could have done to change anything though and my interaction with him is what taught me this about life‚Äî fate and destiny are real. 

What happened to separate us was something that transpired even before we met- the whole thing was very odd. 

It felt like the meeting and connection was absolutely meant to happen, but in many ways- it also truly felt like it was meant to end at that time. The last time I saw him face to face and up close, I thought to myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to see this person again for awhile.‚Äù

I had a lot of blocks up and was really defensive with him- I couldn‚Äôt and can‚Äôt explain how I acted, he brought up a lot in me. 

I know it was the same for him with me, but I feel like I had the awareness to understand this was part of it. I don‚Äôt think he did. I think he had a lot of darkness to face and I always knew it wasn‚Äôt mine- although fate and destiny do exist, we all have free will and that shifts things. 

After our meeting, our night staying up all night and spent talking for 8 hours, and our ending- I had an awakening in the forest and then I had a dream. 

My dream was so spiritual, it literally felt like another life and it opened up my world. 

In my dream, we were sitting on big and comfy white chairs together, under a white bright light, in the midst of a dark conference room. We had to sit in this stage for awhile until we moved onto the next place. It was an understanding that we had to stay in this place for awhile. My earthly understanding is that we had work to do before we could meet again. 

In my dream, he whispered in my ear and bolts of electricity went through my body and cleared blocks within my whole body- including my ear on the right side that was blocked. It sent actual shivers into my entire body and that ear opened up- it was the first time I had ever heard anyone so clearly. 

After that- there were more synchronicities- I saw him two times in very strange circumstances.

Nothing about this has ever made sense. I think my friends wonder why and how I could love someone so much that I barely knew. But I knew his spirit better than I knew my ex husband of five years and better than my ex love and friend of 13 years. 

He was 10 years older than I was and I felt a calling to move to this area for the past 7 years before I moved here. I had never even been here. I moved on 11/11 in 2018, and we first connected on 8/8 in 2019. In an area with 1.5 million people, I moved sight unseen to this area when I did and moved 3.3 miles away from him. My spirit literally just chose this place and then all of this happened. 

My connection with him was immediate and known and psychic. But in the physical plane, it was always missing something. In some ways, I am grateful our relationship didn‚Äôt become more or longer- I could not have dealt with that grief.

I never knew most of this could exist."

RedPillWomen,fpkqnb5,t3_gdrf9t,1588699346.0,"I think it‚Äôs funny when people define ‚Äúprime‚Äù based off of a few years in life- like age 20-25? Like whooooooooo, sorry human women- you get 5 years- that‚Äôs it. 

Back then, I didn‚Äôt know much about sex, life, love, relationships, myself, what I wanted, a vision for life, orgasms.. I thought I did but I didn‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôd say age 28- things really shifted for me in so many ways. 

I‚Äôm 32 and sex, relationships, friendships, money, exercise, my body, life, it all just gets better and better. Actually my skin is better, too. Not my hair though. That‚Äôs literally probably it lol oh and my boobs üòÇ

Also prime sexual market value is usually defined by weirdo hookup artists like Neil what‚Äôs his name and/or college frat boys and/or Hollywood. Or people who do not understanding that everyone will get wrinkles and get old- life doesn‚Äôt stop though. 

Plastic Hollywood or the quest for eternal youth and immortality is not real life. 

Sure from a scientific viewpoint, a woman this young will be more fertile. But becoming a mom at 23 for me was so young. I‚Äôd be a much better mom to a newborn now. We are all worth way more than our uteruses.

offmychest,fpk24oj,t3_gdt9yn,1588686449.0,"I agree. I keep debating‚Äî go back for my masters to be a therapist and have 60k additional in debt and then have to raise prices? Or do a health coach certification for $5k or less, get certified for somatic experiencing, and be able to charge people much less and take pro bono etc? While not calling myself a therapist but a nervous system health coach?

I think I‚Äôm going to go with #2 but I‚Äôm poor also and even 5k up front is a lot as a single mom trying to swing life with no support. 

I could do the masters and get school loan but then.... be in debt forever and have to charge people much more. 

Super frustrating.

I do have my bachelors in psychology, study and follow all things therapy, analysis, nervous system health, etc‚Äî and have been in a counselor position before for domestic and sexual violence. 

My health coach certification would either be at Duke or Mayo Clinic- masters level‚Äî so you have to have a bachelors and some type of health related degree.

I got therapy with insurance but you have to be functioning to be at that level- it‚Äôs true. When I was on Medicaid, there were no therapists available who were decent, taking new patients, or even available. If I made more money than I do now- my insurance premiums would be much higher and I likely wouldn‚Äôt have the lower copays and opportunities that I do. Like I‚Äôm just poor enough. Once I make more- my deductibles and copays will prob be much higher and I won‚Äôt be able to afford it anymore with being in a higher tax bracket too, etc. 

Plus I live in a good area with good options.

Everyone alllwaysss just said it was anxiety. But it‚Äôs not. Or they probably secretly thought I was not eating or had some type of anxiety disorder. It‚Äôs definitely something physical but I‚Äôve seen so many doctors and nobody knows what.

When I was juicing celery juice daily, as well as grapefruit juice- my potassium was normal! At like 4.7! Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt alleviate some of my other symptoms but it did stop the heart stuff for like a solid year.

What kind of stomach issues do you have and what else?? What do you eat, what supplements? Do you wake up in the middle of the night gasping for air? Any sleep issues? Where do you live? Have you been exposed to mold or toxic water? Are you vaccinated? How old are u? Trying to see what we have in common. It would be crazy to figure it out together! 

I honestly manage mine with trying to fix my gut. Literally nothing else has helped. When it first happened, my stomach was super bloated and I was crazy constipated (unfortunately low potassium causes constipation too) but I also had rashes going on, severeeeeeeee fatigue, panic attacks, muscle weakness and aches, high heart rate all the time, shortness of breath, and high bp spikes. I also lost about 10 lbs and couldn‚Äôt eat. 

I could send you my before and after photos, holy shit, it‚Äôs insane. I looked like I was dying. My only thought is that it was something gut related from inflammation and maybe it flares up now randomly. It came on again recently after getting very sick at the end of January (what I suspect was covid). It takes me forever to recover from illnesses and whatever this issue is flared again.

gluten is the devil and causes issues... so does dairy. I absolutely do not drink alcohol. 

Taking magnesium helps, eating looots of fruits and veggies, and I‚Äôve recently started fermenting foods.

Too much water isn‚Äôt good or it can flush you out. Avoid having diarrhea at all costs.

I can do light exercise most days and sometimes can walk a mile or two. Today I‚Äôll try to walk about 30 min and do some weights and exercise at home. At my best, I could walk 5 miles per day and be okay. But then I go weeks doing barely anything at all, just surviving- like can barely move or cook or clean or leave the house. Only resting. So not sure what I would say for myself. Id say 70-80% sometimes (I will have energy but it‚Äôs not ‚Äúclean‚Äù, it feels like I‚Äôm hyped up and uncomfortable, then I crash) and then other times like 30%. 

16 years though and in 2018 to 2019 I was basically bed bound for about 10 months. Same thing happened in 2014 and 2015. In varying degrees bed bound but absolutely house bound. I could barely do anything or take care of me and my child. It was terrible. 

***I notice dramatic improvements from certain things like diet and sunshine. Gluten causes the worst fatigue and dairy a close second. I have to eat very, very clean and particular or else I‚Äôm wrecked. Getting sunshine helps- I just sit on a bench outside or open all my windows. I‚Äôm worse during different seasons. Also, I think magnesium is helping lately significantly, along with fermented foods. Also taking coq10 for mitochondria and choline for brain health.
