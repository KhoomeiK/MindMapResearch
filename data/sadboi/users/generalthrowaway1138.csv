offmychest,exkdewq,t1_exkcnb8,1566385416.0,Thank you.
offmychest,exkcqmd,t1_exkc7fs,1566384590.0,"Thanks. I know it's absurd to ask internet strangers for validation, but after yet another round of punching-bag family telling me to get back in contact, I just feel weirdly childish.  In all my years, I've never been left to my anger. My hurt. It's an endless speakerphone of forgiveforgiveforgiveforgiveforgive. I'm not ready. I don't know if I'll ever be ready. Maybe I'll die angry. But I'd rather die angry than... than whatever I feel right now.

Anyway. Thanks for your reply. It was helpful. I'm having a hard time articulating what I'm feeling."

bipolar,ewjiooh,t3_cfz55z,1565467244.0,"People who aren't my close friends think I live an amazing life because I travel. Nah, I just can't keep a job so I work from my computer during manic periods to squirrel all the money I can for the depression. I can't keep a home, so I hop from airbnb monthly rental to airbnb monthly rental. I hate travel at this point. I just want to clear my mania-caused debts, go back to school, get the degree I wanted (the one I have I got because it was easy for me to complete during episodes), and have a fucking life. I stopped posting on facebook because I got sick of people saying how awesome my travels look. They're not awesome. They're compulsive. I hate it."
