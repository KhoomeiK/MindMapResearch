Gorgeous rural area with lots of hiking trails and waterfalls, a great park, a zero waste brewery with some pretty good beers, and some nice recently opened coffee shops and restaurants. There's a small community of artists, some hipsters from the city, but a lot have been making traditional crafts and tools for centuries. Kamikatsu is another good rural Tokushima town, the first one in Japan to adapt a zero waste policy.

Nowhere in Tokushima is exactly close to a big city, but closer to Osaka than any of the other prefectures in Shikoku (about 2-3 hours by car or bus)."

This isn't just about whether or not JET is a valuable experience. This is an unprecedented time of uncertainty, and not a great time to move to a foreign country imo. Go to grad school, reapply to JET later if you want to, or maybe find an alternative route to Japan that better utilizes whatever your major is? JET is more a gap year than a genuine career choice."

My JTEs claim they can't speak English well enough to teach those classes on their own. One of them actually said ""Maybe we'll ask (filipino student) to help because she can speak English."" Of course I have a year's worth of lesson plans for each class, but they're all in English. In the past, when I've had to leave sub plans due to sickness or SDCs, the teachers have just shown movies instead. That's probably what's going to happen in those classes.

Only symptom I don't have is a fever, despite body chills. Was asked if I'd been to Hokkaido or in contact with people from Wuhan. No. Told I didn't need the test.


Monday, woke up feeling less body tired (probably thanks to the 14 hours of sleep I'd gotten the night before), but my throat was much worse.

I was yet again refused on the grounds that my temperature wasn't high enough and I haven't been to infected areas. The doctor apologized and said he couldn't examine me because he thinks it's highly likely I have coronavirus, so the only thing I could do is self-quarantine and keep recording symptoms, and I guess cross my fingers that I get a fucking fever so I can get tested.


Received permission from work to stay home until the symptoms pass. Each day I wake up with a fun new symptom. Today it's painful swallowing and swollen lymph nodes.


It isn't so terrible that I feel like I need hospitalization. It just feels like a crappy respiratory infection that I would like to be diagnosed. What if it's not coronavirus?
