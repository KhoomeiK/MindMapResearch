CatAdvice,fr27vx6,t3_glxek8,1589832664.0,"just calm down, fellow custodian! it is perfectly normal not to feel anything in the beginning...a relationship takes time to evolve...

&#x200B;

just adopted an 8 year old cat 7 weeks ago and 2 weeks ago I felt like I wanted to give him up. I am more of a dog person in general and of course he needed some time to warm up to me. he was a stranger, was pissed he lost his home and hissed at me when I tried to be nice. would not play...just used me as his food provider. dogs are a lot easier to handle and I regretted the decision.

&#x200B;

then people here reminded me how scared he must be and insecure and we have bonded a lot since two weeks ago. and he actually likes to play! he just did not feel safe enough. I only ever was around outdoor cats and had serious problems adjusting to the litter box. my life was running pretty smooth before I took him in and suddenly everything was ""new"". he made me feel like I know nothing about cats...never had a cat hiss at me before.

&#x200B;

so, be patient...nothing bad will happen...do your relaxation exercises you know and give it time. be confident in yourself and let the situation evolve. take a nice bath. it sounds you will handle the responsibility well otherwise you would not have prepared so well. it takes some time. I was not sure if I got an arrogant asshole cat...he is a sweet kitten. :)"

it helped tremendously to hear some voices on my frustration with the bonding because honestly I am way more used to dogs and dogs are way more used to humans than cats. it is a lot easier for us. cats are a completely different species. and to be honest I am way more afraid of my cat than any of the sometimes dangerous dogs I have dealt with. not because my cat is evil. they have a lot faster movements. today I finally found a game he likes to play...teasing with a blooming blade of grass. my cat has an extraordinarily big jaw and fangs...I really wished he never attacked me. the way he went onto the blade...oh well

> You need to be willing to give without expecting something in return. yeah but that is where I am inpatient. it has always been a pattern of mine and it let to others taking advantage of me. life in general is what is happening while you make other plans but I know for sure a dog would long have opened up to me. I mean I was taking care of an arrogant asshole dog almost 2 years ago. with him though it was clear he will only be with me until his human returns from hospital. this cat is supposed to be a decade of commitment (hopefully for him).

It sounds like he is nervous and displaying dominant behaviors as a defense.

this sentence hits home. I know he must be confused now and it is too human to get upset but I never had a cat hissing at me. you know he would come for his pats and once he got enough hiss at me and take off. like what did I do wrong?! obviously I had been around very domesticated cats who did not mind to be looked at. he was very senstive to it. on day 3 I dared not look into the eyes of my boyfriend because I had the behaviour internalized. lol

then somebody pointed me to this jackson guy and in a related video I heard about the michelangelo finger. he seemed to like that but after a week or so my finger almost fell off.lol

communication with animals is not always easy. I once scared off a blackbird by throwing her a worm. she of course only saw the intimidating hand and not the worm...but end of the breeding season she showed me her flock before taking them to the woods I suppose. I thought I had lost her but they were all gathered around me for a minute. it was nice.

I got the cat directly from the previous human but he did not tell much about the cat`s story. from the scars on his ears and a remark of the owner the two cats were playing pretty wild. I can imagine the female cat was the ""good"" darling with the humans and my cat did not engage much in human interaction. I imagine there were games of dominance between the two cats. my tom cat making up for the human neglect by cutting down the female cat who drew here importance by being favored by the humans.

so while you are  probably right that my cat is displaying dominant behaviors as a defense it could be more of a pattern he is used to also. projecting onto me the ""war"" he had going on with this other cat. 

sure, patience, not too many expectations aso but the cat comes with a history and patterns I do not fully understand. I guess 5 weeks is too early to give up, hmm?"

from your text I might assume being center is a somewhat neutral position you hold dear...the way I read this chart being center to me means being pretty authoritarian. I feel very comfortable with my position on the left, down corner of their sprectrum because I am defining myself as libertarian socialist. if you think of that as any kind of extremism your are wrong in an objective sense but maybe right in a mainstream sense of current trends.

and no, you cannot love jesus the same way as the antichrist because in their true sense they contradict themselves...the christ and the anti-christ. you can of course love jesus and have your own view on what an anti-christ is supposed to mean. THAT is open to discussion. a satanist may be closer to a christ-consciousness than any average christian out there. if they are a satanist misinterpreting and calling to dark forces with blood sacrifices they are opposed to a christ-consciousness. words imply meaning but are used in a confusing way and have different meanings...partly blown out of proportion on purpose by propagandistic think-tanks.

I feel strongly about evolving the collective frame into something where an individual can enjoy real personal freedom.

you do not get that by simply denying the existence of the collective frame we all depend on.

yeah well, the stigma and discrimination to mental issues does suck. I agree with that. due to the fact there had been suicides around me when I was young I early started to break this taboo (1990). and it still amazes me how many people seem to hear intellectually challenged when I speak of a disability of the psyche (I do not mean to trigger you but I am a provocative person and come from a different lingual background (german). all official papers speak of disabilities. I got a mental and a physical disability).

anyway. it has been frustrating in the past. you meet nice people, hit it off in conversation and as soon as you tell them you have mental issues...please note: due to being violently victimized as a child!...like 80 or 90% of the people lock you out immediately. I think it also has to do with their unsolved issues but whatever...it hurts and buffles. one moment ago I was a different person and now I am not trusted anymore? in an instant? because of a label? because I got hurt you feel the need to hurt me too?!

but now wait. so 10 years ago I had an accident and need to use a wheelchair to mobilize now. my body changed but I pretty much stayed the same. you have no idea how condescending and patronizing people think they can be towards somebody slightly different. like any word I said was received completely different than before on two legs. now, 10 years after my personality has changed and I acquired a different way of communication aaand way more arrogance towards people. they WILL step on you if you are too nice and vulnerable.

now back to the initial topic of labeling. depression actually is pretty acknowledged now compared to decades ago. but in general people should not feel ashamed of being open about their psyche...it is the core of the human existence. life in best case IS the development of the psyche and learning to deal with it`s tricks. it is wrong it is a taboo. not the diagnosis should be changed but the public perception. imo

and last but not least. I know how hard it is to acknowledge one`s ""definciency"". I remember when I went to see a therapist for the first time 25 years ago. what a drama! when I ended up in the psych ward for the first time 20 years ago. my life was over! NO. I have had the privilege and luck to get a sick pension 20 years ago and I do not have to worry to starve. that said...I see it as huge privilege I was able to deal with my psyche in detail. yeah, especially recently I have become very misanthropic towards most people and kind of arrogant...I mean they keep putting me down for nothing but I have done my homework. the majority just sucks as hell. sorry...why else is the bio-sphere destroyed so much? because they in their busy ignorance are following the right path?! because most of them are too much of cowards to even accept some treatment and deny all their problems until they develop a psycho-somatic issue or whatever? ridiculous.

tl;dr: depression is not just something physical...it is about the psyche and therefor ""labeled"" correctly but society is stupid about the label."

more so I consider depression a symptom to an underlying condition. took me a long time to figure out I had a suppressed childhood-trauma. when anything is bothering my little trauma me joins right in to enjoy her share of drama. 

and real depression is not just feeling a little sad. people have real issues to function...get out of bed, wash, get dressed, get fed. maybe you are too young and never have had to take care of yourself and the depression will hit you harder once you are on your own. maybe you are just a little unhappy and do not experience true depression.

in general...a lot of folks who identify themselves with one ideology propagate a lot of the opposite...having said before I want to overcome this artificial antagonism that derives from propaganda blurring the lines with the intention to make it impossible to see and argue clearly.

 primary interest has always been the only anti I value (we ought to phrase positively in order to make it work) which is anti-fascism. going from there I search for a pacifist course and societal structures that give credit and serve to overcome the main tension there is between collective forces and personal freedom to evolve to a full personality (one obstacle on the way is the eternal arguing about left and right stances)

and please note I am NOT spelling my libertarian with a capital L. and please note I define myself as libertarian socialist and not socialist libertarian. and last note multinational companies provide for a huge centralization and infringing on people`s freedom. therefor the current system does not really support the themes it tries to sail on (personal freedom). we as a human species will not escape taking some collective and furthermore global responsibility.

you are right about one thing though...the immanent tension between collective structure and personal freedom. it  IS a given. you see it solved by giving arbitrary entities arbitrary power over individuals as well as collective structures? I see a contradiction there bigger than trying to fuse two of the main ""opposing"" themes.

I do not intend to start another discussion about the term liberal and the leftwing in my region is not taking well to this term but I personally can identify with that label just as well. as also I have no problems admitting my anarchistic roots that lead to my reflection for a good part. in the end all the meaning that there is to anarchy is that it is the contrary of hierarchy...I wanna see the hierachies flat but they are unavoidable and coining the term as ""chaos"" just does not do it justice.

in my definition socialism acknowledges the collective setting and responsibility. the antithesis you are seeing is quite the us-american thing because you have a Libertarian Party (and even within this party there have been diverging positions, gradually shifting towards more authoritarian ones over the past decades)

language and definitions are crucial and long been issues of propagandic wars to divide the population. I am not in favor of ""final"", mostly fashionable definitions of words because it does not help.

see, I come from a leftist environment and am trying to overcome some of  the what I consider sick traditions. do I think individuals should own the planet? no. I do think the collective is responsible for the environment but I do not want to see it ""own"" it. ""we living only borrow this planet""

this whole ""leftist"" discourse stems from a completely twisted time and reality and therefor is not valid. for example I see marx as one of the most misinterpreted figures on earth. I do not read his (and engel`s) communist manifest as a postulate for communism. in fact they list a bunch of fake socialisms there and tried to curb the movements of that time that in many ways did not harmonize with their scientific findings. marx did see some macro-economics very clearly and I see his Kapital as a warning but more so he simply was a good sociologist. back then with the rise of the industrial revolution contents heavily shifted towards ""economical"" reasoning. until then it was feudalism and religion. early socialist movements had a strong global consciousness and that is imo where they fucked up when they got all lost in national power fights over the f***ing production means. 

in any form of society but especially if you base it on a broader collective sense there is the problem not to overrule the individual...that is where the libertarian (with a little l not us-american party!) suffix becomes important to balance it.

I could imagine this is the reason for a trump being in his position where he is now. he will be an easy target to get all kinds of blame for incompetency...the power will shift towards the east (most likely china) for some time to do the ""dirty work"" and some time later the ""old west"" will ""be remembered"" and the dirty structures will have become normalcy.
