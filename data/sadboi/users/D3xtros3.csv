Mccafferty,fjpzyrd,t1_firgyk4,1583564385.0,"As someone with bipolar 2, anything I do while in a hypo manic state, I am responsible for. There are things to do to help with being manic. There are ways to cope, taking medication, therapy, learning to recognize the signs and being able to get help before you do stupid dick head things."

depression,f2xd1qf,t3_del3c8,1570476675.0,"This is possibly the worst thing you can say to someone who is struggling. It makes 0 sense. If I can't be sad because someone else has it worse, then I can't be happy either because someone has it better, right? 

Feel sad. Feel happy. Feel mad. These are your body's natural responses to things and you shouldn't hide or dismiss it because someone else 'has it worse'. 

I hope what they said didn't affect you too much."

parentproblems,f24eafl,t3_dbhp3c,1569950118.0,"Keeping in mind I know almost nothing about Turkey, I'd say to try to get out of that situation as soon as you can. Get a job (even if very low paying, at least you'll get money and be out of the house more), avoid your father and mother until you can get your own place or move in with a friend. And if you don't have any friends, try your hardest to make some. It can be extremely hard to make friends when you're depressed and abused because you grow this complex that everyone hates you. Not everyone hates you. I don't. I think you're just an abused lonely kid. I assume Turkey has some shelters you can go to where you can get food, a place to sleep, and some support. Think about going to one of those until you get things figured out if you can't do the other things. You are not in a healthy environment and it is so good you're able to recognize that because you deserve it so much better. I hope you can take someone's advice and I hope you don't end up taking your own life. Don't become another statistic. Just keep fighting and looking for answers."
JustNoSO,f21wiw9,t3_dbcj2t,1569877709.0,"I am so terribly sorry this is happening to you; you deserve so much more. With that said, leave him. Before you do, try to get him another support system. Have him make friends and more connections than you. And then move in with your parents until you can figure something else out. Having an SO is supposed to be a time full of love and happiness and life. He’s just a chore."
