I'm sure they all care about you and would be heartbroken if you die. Life is rough sometimes. Those periods can last for a long or a short amount of time. I don't know your situation and what you're going through, but In sure if you talk to somebody life will become better. (Sorry, English isn't my first language)"

I'm sure you didn't deserve this. I'm sure you aren't the things that he called you. I am absolutely sure that you deserve someone better. I hope you get better in the following days. ❤"
