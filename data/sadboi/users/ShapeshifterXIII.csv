MakeNewFriendsHere,fkg3qow,t3_fi5yj9,1584149209.0,"Researches state that the woman is seen as more friendly and welcomed to talk to, so when a female posts it's more likely to attract both genders. On the other hand, when a male posts, supposedly there is nothing they can talk to with other guys and get stimulated. It's pure psychology and science of hormones. A guy gets excited when they meet a female, they want pictures of her almost immediately and if she does not meet their qualification standards they will abandon her. However, I bring me as an example and you also, some people are here literally to make friends because they feel sad and depressed. I myself broke up half a year ago and I've become isolated because of that relationship (she FORCED me to cut ties with pretty much everyone). So basically I am alone. I did a post here previously today and I also conducted a survey (the idea was stolen by a female editor, whose survey got 100+ people's attentions whereas mine got 9, and above those, the 2 are ignoring me now and I only got to talk to a guy from Germany who's pretty cool and we have conversation from discord). My point is, sexism exists, I understand your situation, but you can't do nothing about people who SEEK simulation, and btw an e girl never made anyone happy -that goes for you fuckasses who can't find a real gf-.if you need someone to talk to, msg me here or on discord (I have it in my profiles bio -Crito#9759) would be glad to hear you, lucky for you I study psychology so maybe we can figure this out together somehow, free of charge of courseðŸ˜‚."

Pinpoint to him that even though he is getting bullied at the moment, one day he will achieve what he wants if he puts effort into it. What I would say is that being bullied builds characters. one day they will see at josh who was fucking oppressed by his social circle as he makes a fuckin impact on this piece of crap world as they do their desk jobs.
