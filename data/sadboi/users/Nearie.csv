Anxiety,fr315t7,t3_gmc605,1589847863.0,I think it's your blood going back into normal circulation after your blood thinning so much from the excessive alcohol. This happens to me all the time after drinking too. It happens in my feet sometimes as well.
tumblr,fr2vcsr,t3_gmc70l,1589844613.0,wtf the good mythical mornings video on facts about Disney parks came on my tv as soon as I started reading this... that made this so much creepier lol (its been autoplaying a playlist all day)

Anxiety,fofuayw,t1_focseop,1587742947.0,"Essentially, yeah! Like I feel like I'm getting too relaxed (cause you know, us kiddos with anxiety are always clenching/straining subconsciously) so once my body stops doing that I feel like I'm going numb and dying I guess?"
Anxiety,focb5ib,t3_g6rol0,1587669245.0,Yess so much lately. I have been so scared that I am going to die in my sleep so when I start getting relaxed and start falling asleep I'll get that exact feeling that you described and it shoots me back awake and I have to just do it over and over for hours until I get so exhausted I don't even care if I'm dying anymore I just want to get some god damn rest.

Anxiety,fnki8k5,t1_fnkhnet,1587028045.0,"I work as a server and it happens to me almost every time when I first introduce myself to the table. I feel like I look like a crazy person and it makes my anxiety so much worse. It also happens when I get my hair cut and happened when I got my first tattoo, my body, head or hands will just uncontrollably jolt. It almost feels like a form of tourette's (not thay there is anything at all wrong with having tourettes obviously) its just soo embarrassing. :("
