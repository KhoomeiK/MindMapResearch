relationship_advice,ez31ihd,t3_czw32e,1567660137.0,"I had a similar thing come up recently. I would personally play the opener something like this...

YOU: The other day, I opened Facebook (hers? yours?) and saw the invite to the show you told me about Saturday. I know this between us is new, and we haven't really figured this out yet, but I'm really enjoying it, so when I realized this band has one of your guy friends in it and that you hadn't mentioned it,  I felt a little uncomfortable and maybe a little jealous. The last thing I intended to do is violate your privacy, and the last thing I want to come off as is overbearing, but seeing that left a weird taste in my mouth. etc. etc."
relationship_advice,ez31hj2,t1_ez2z2yf,1567660125.0,"Not even that... just sort of asking for advice (based on age, length of relationship, being in college, etc.) on how to handle the situation, with an LDR being one of among other options."
relationship_advice,ez2yzow,t3_czw3oq,1567659512.0,"I would approach him calmly, without any accusations or rash break-up threats, and reopen this conversation you've shared previously about your trust issues. Let him know your anxiety is flaring up, and what's contributing to it. He may ask if there's anything he can do, and be prepared to be reasonable. I know talk is cheap, and getting cheated on makes it feel even cheaper, and you even more vulnerable, but communication is EVERYTHING."
relationship_advice,ez2wu7l,t1_ez2pq46,1567659207.0,"Unfortunately, the school I'm attending is also one my resume would be bitter to lose... but transferring (while not entirely off the table) still leaves about nine months living on opposite coasts, which is, although not impossible, daunting and a bit painful. Definitely on the table though!"
relationship_advice,ez2w12p,t1_ez2rxb0,1567659014.0,"Oh, this made me cry! You're absolutely right. Do the best we can, and trust the path. I just don't want any bad communication that can come with physical separation/being busy kids to foil anything in the future. I really do love him. Thank you for your insight. :)"
