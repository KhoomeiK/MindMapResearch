trees,ey15p5f,t3_cv0y1u,1566690516.0,"I‚Äôve experimented with carts vs wax itself. 

Carts give me a quick head high, shoot my tolerance up, also the high lasts about an hour if that. With carts you‚Äôre constantly trying to get high but never reaching that ‚Äúfull‚Äù high.

Wax (having all the cannabinoids) feels like smoking a whole joint per dab and the high lasts as long as flower so for 4-6 hours for me. And they get you WAY higher than carts. I stick with wax after months of experimentation and switching. I don‚Äôt touch carts anymore.

Oh and the indica sativa thing is real. A true indica will knock me out in a sleep coma while a true sativa will make me feel like I‚Äôm having a minor acid trip and have my heart racing like no tomorrow.
