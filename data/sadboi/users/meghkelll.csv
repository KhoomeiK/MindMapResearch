BipolarReddit,fly2rqm,t3_fragcg,1585594471.0,"im on 200mg and have been for a while. i do find it to be incredibly difficult to wake up, more than i ever have in my life. i do agree with the fatigue throughout the day. definitely bring this up to your doctor. taking your dosage at night might be a solution. when i took it at night in the beginning it made me extremely sick every morning, but thats just my experience. otherwise, the tiredness gets better and more managable. i am thankful for lamictal as it helped change my life. i work on the fatigue through structured routine and caffeine, lol. hang in there"
BipolarReddit,fly263l,t3_fraua9,1585594161.0,"i have acne prone skin and have been on 200mg lamictal for a while. i have however seen a dermatologist who perscribed me spirolactone, a pill, and epiduo, a topical gel. i know another pill is not ideal but i barely notice when i take it with my other meds. it really cleared my skin. im sure there are many combinations but i thought adding in what acne medication im personally on would be helpful. you said you were unable to use some acne creams, but if you have the opprotunity to reach out to a derm, they will work with you and any other medications you’re on, like lamictal. hang in there."
BipolarReddit,fly1goo,t3_fr0him,1585593793.0,"are you taking it at night? taking lamitcal at night was hell for me because i felt extremely sick every morning. i feel that the nightmares subsided when i started taking lamtical in the morning. otherwise, i unfortunately still get them, but having routine definitely helps. this break in my routine, the quarantine, has left me with terrible nightmares. do you think that could be an issue too? the world is really upside down right now.

talk to your doctor if the nightmares persist. they are there to work with you! good luck and hang in there."

netflix,flwcw6j,t3_frkrhq,1585546391.0,"happened to me before. email netflix support saying your account was hacked and the email and password have been changed. they will work with you and eventually will most likely send you a new confirmation code allowing you to change your password/log back in. from what i understand, this doesnt not mean your regular email account is compromised, as many of these netflix hackers get in remotely. with that being said, always take the extra step if you’re worried and contact the customer support for your email.(gmail, comcast, etc.). or, as this might be easier, bring this conern up when contacting netflix. 

with my netflix however, my email is fine and the problem was fixed very quickly through the netflix customer support, and nothing new has happened since. good luck!"

BipolarReddit,fj4nfq4,t3_fbggu7,1583012359.0,"god its so important to me to see that others struggle with this. it has ruined so many conversations and leaves me feeling empty and without anything personal to my name. and when im hypomanic, its one of the scariest feelings to feel so empty. things can go so wrong. 

ive learned try even harder to let others continue to talk and to not interrupt. usually my oversharing shows itself through incessant interruptions. its annoying to my friends but absolutely more annoying to myself. 

its so comforting to see that i am not alone in this!"

BipolarReddit,f6kfln8,t3_drpukp,1572911520.0,"i’ve been on 100mg, but now im at a happy 200. i was always someone who flew through academic papers, but i have absolutely noticed a “lag” in my ability to write since taking this medication. i relate to what you are saying for sure, but i’d like to point out that despite the differences in my thinking process, my ability to write and achievements remain. you may have to learn to cope with any new cognitive patterns, but remember that you are still your outgoing, fun self inside. that self will still shine even if it takes some work. i feared this but i learned that the medications i take are there to help me get back on track!

lamitcal changed my life; i am myself again. as others said, the trade-off was extremely worth it. 

basically, if you feel comfortable, take the chance to heal and remember that you will not lose yourself. its a process, but i hope its possible and works out for you!"
