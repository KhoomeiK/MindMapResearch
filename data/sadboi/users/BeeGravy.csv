Like, its empirical and provable that hes an absolute dunce.  

And police are kind of bs. Acting like they're in a warzone, and emptying mags at unarmed people/no obligation to save anyone/steroid abuse/anger issues/killing dogs/lying and planting evidence, the list goes on. Youd have to be pretty stupid to not see a massive problem with not only law enforcement but the justice system as a whole.  

Not sure why I wasted the time replying, fully expecting a standard npc style response."

I have the most intense and vivid dreams, most are absolutely horrifying, some are lucid, sleep paralysis only a time or two, some, very few, are amazing (winning a ton of money, buying an awesome house, meet the love of my life, a dead family member is alive) and then like you said, you wake up back into your shitty life and its depressing.   

So its like, horrible violent nightmares, or rare great dreams that make me depressed.  

I'd love a nice, quality, restful nights sleep. It's been so long. Only med that helped was ambien, but it's now a controlled substance and my docs refuse to prescribe it again (and they had severely over prescribed me before, I was on it for like 5 years straight, daily)"
