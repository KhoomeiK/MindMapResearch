Adverseness - there must be a real adverse issue

Standing - injury, causation, redressability 

Ripeness- petitioner must have exhausted all remedies

Mootness- whether or not a controversy still exists. 

In cases like these where you‚Äôre looking at 1 person thinking of suing over an injury, in this case, loss of money. It is best to file a CLASS ACTION law suit. Meaning that you gather multiple petitioners with the same grievance to take on the case together.

Death threats and so on are the same results. As far as a case being hard to win, who are you to say? Once evidence is gathered, it‚Äôs all up in the air by way of inductive reasoning and the most cogent arguments presented. 

‚ÄúBelieve women‚Äù - dumbest claim that has plagued recent times. Before you twist what I‚Äôm saying, you should be careful to read my words.
