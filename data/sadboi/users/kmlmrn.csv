The education is also the parents obligation, so, if gets to a point where you can do no more, the teacher absolutely should call the parents so they can do something about it.

relationship_advice,erml1cl,t1_ermke29,1561028153.0,"I understand what you mean, but he is attracted to OP and in other comments she says that their sexual life didn't change at all after that revelation. She is probably 1 in a million women that he will ever feel attracted and probably this has to do with her personality and all, things that are much more complex than just sexual attraction. What I mean is that he is sure that he loves her and he is sexual attracted to her (even if its only to her) and that is enough to considere him bissexual, even if he does not. But in my opinion we do not need stablish these labels very much, if we feel confortable in our own skin. Try to fit in a box often does more harm than good. Don't think she needs to be worry about being cheated cause he will miss the experience with man, it is not uncommon bissexuals who feel attracted to a gender but never had a experience."
relationship_advice,ermjf05,t1_erlplk6,1561025906.0,"He doesn't seems confused at all. Why people just like to call bissexuals ""confused""?

Sure, because he feels atrracted by other men he certainly will be a cheater. That is absurd to say."
relationship_advice,ermiyy6,t3_c2pbby,1561025247.0,"The confusion its because people who aren't bi is always saying BS, like ""you're 50/50"", but the truth is often you are more attracted by one gender than other, but if he loves you, even if you are the only woman he will ever love, he is bissexual. The label really doesn't matter here, because he seems pretty sure you are the one and nothing has change between you guys. Please don't buy that BS that he will never be satisfied enough just with you, that he will change you for a man: bissexuals hear that A LOT, and it is so much and so prejudiced that I can not even begin to speak. Just mantain your relationship very open to dialogue, and trust him and not what others may say, you are the person that really knows his heart."
