NarcissisticAbuse,fnxoj3d,t3_g4fzzv,1587342998.0,"I suffered a miscarriage early on in my relationship with my ex, and I suffered terribly. I never thought I would say this after how much I mourned that loss, but I was fortunate. Watching everything he has done to the mother of his children, how much he continuously harasses her, I know that the loss I suffered served a higher purpose. Escape. We share absolutely nothing — no property, no children, not even our last names. I have been able to erase him from my life completely.

But all the things you described - the mirroring, lovebombing, future faking - my head was so far in the clouds those first few months that I didn’t notice him digging my grave. In the years that followed, he took everything from me that he could, both tangible and intangible. He stole my confidence, robbed me of my time, conned me out of so very much money, coerced the most abusive intimate acts that he could, and all along endangered my health by having sex with other women. I finally left, but it was likely not long before he would have left me. He could not have sustained that type of abuse much longer without killing me or making me crazy. The grand finale was him drugging me and telling me it was an accident. 

These people are not people. They’re monsters. I remember months ago he did the most truly heinous thing he had done so far, and I tried to leave, convinced it was rock bottom. He won me back with his lovebombing, only to turn the abuse up several notches when I returned.

But I feel like what he did pales in comparison to what yours has done by denying you your child. I cannot imagine someone keeping me from mine. I would be devastated and heartbroken. I hope you have a pit bull of an attorney fighting for you. Just know that you have a whole life ahead of you, full of all sorts of milestones. You may have missed some of the early ones but there are so many more to come. Just keep fighting and know that one day your child will be old enough that her mother won’t be able to play these games so easily. I’m wishing you lots of peace and a quick resolution to your visitation issues."
NarcissisticAbuse,fnsbsxw,t1_fns36za,1587218105.0,"Preach!

Unfortunately society has basically taught us that getting the ring, getting married, etc. is a sign of success. That to be complete, we have to be coupled. I hate that line from the movie, ""you complete me."" We should be complete on our own. 

We can be immensely successful without a significant other. We can be happy without a significant other. And being single is not a life of being alone. Friends, family, coworkers, there are so many people that fill our lives, and help make our lives fulfilling. I regret having adopted the belief for so many years that marriage, or being coupled, was a hallmark of success. It is not. Some of the most amazing people out there in the world are single, happy, and successful. Unless you meet someone who can bring value to your life in a positive way, with love, emotional support, and honesty, you are better off without them.

Single is not a punishment, it is not a negative trait, it is not something to dread or hate. Single means valuing yourself enough that you choose not to settle for anything less than a partner who respects, cares for you and honors you. And this bull$hit about relationships being hard work? Most things worth having in life take a little bit of work and some elbow grease.  But if you have to struggle every day to not have constant tension, arguments, and cheating, you need to walk away, it is not supposed to be THAT much work."
NarcissisticAbuse,fnsa162,t1_fns2zi6,1587216851.0,"Thank you so much for explaining this. I had no idea this was a thing, but it helps to make sense of so many things I have been struggling with. In the last week before I left him, he ramped up the abuse to a level I had never experienced before. He lied to me almost constantly, treated me terribly, and literally drugged me. He said it was accidental. It was not. The more upset I became with his behavior, the worse he behaved. Our last argument was horrific. Unforgettable. 

I have never heard of the term ""extinction burst"" before today. It makes so much sense though. He knew I was exhausted from his lying and cheating and gaslighting, he knew I was looking to leave, and he doubled down on the abuse. I guess he was expecting I would fall back in line like I always did. I left him instead.

It is all a game for them. And it is a game you cannot win unless you leave."
NarcissisticAbuse,fnppk3j,t1_fnny9rf,1587149653.0,"So much this. It feels like losing the love of your life because the person becomes your entire life, and your future. 

For YEARS he kept telling me “next year” we would move in together, “next year” we would get engaged. I finally broke things off when after years of hearing “next year,” it never actually came. He hoovered, promising we would get engaged, he just needed a few weeks until his bonus and then we’d get the ring. The day came and we were at the store getting the ring and he decided we could get a ring, but not an engagement ring, and I couldn’t call it an engagement ring, and it couldn’t look like an engagement ring or have a diamond big enough to be mistaken for an engagement ring. 

I hung around another few more weeks, caught him cheating again for the zillionth time, and finally left. But the future faking? It was the hardest thing to get past. All the years of believing he was the one, that we’d have forever together. The dream. That’s all it was. A dream in my head that was never going to come true. And if it had, it would’ve been a lifetime of abuse instead of a few years of abuse.

One good thing I have going at the moment is how splendidly easy he’s made NC. He’s with the new supply so no Hoovers. I realized all the times I tried to leave were so hard in part because he wouldn’t just let me go. This is the best gift he ever gave me. Better than a ring, better than a wedding. Freedom from abuse, and the space I needed to heal and move on."
NarcissisticAbuse,fnn3dgj,t3_g2mp1x,1587083543.0,"First, block him everywhere. Block, remove, go NC. In EVERY way possible. This is the lovebombing phase for him, and there is no positive value in you playing witness to him putting the new supply on a pedestal.

Second, understand that she is the new you. And like you, she will eventually be brought down from that pedestal, her heart and self-esteem obliterated. You have nothing to be jealous of. Her own experience of devaluation is only a few months away.

Third, go easy on yourself. No, even easier. Give yourself a huge break because he completely messed with all the chemicals in your body, and it’s going to take time to heal and to normalize. You are not crazy. You did nothing wrong. All of his behavior that you described - the instant “soulmate” he claimed you to be, isolating you so that it was just the two of you, then controlling you and devaluing you - it’s all a part of the cycle of abuse. It’s normal to feel hurt, to feel like you’ve been hit by a truck, to wonder how the f this even happened. But it wasn’t you. It’s him. And he will treat her exactly the same. these people rarely change. 

So sorry you’re going through this, just stay strong and avoid social media. Don’t let him continue to hurt and control you."
NarcissisticAbuse,fnm6rr4,t1_fnfk0ev,1587066075.0,"Same. I feel healthier and happier alone than I ever did in all the years I spent with my abuser. I have realized it is so easy for me to be alone because I was always alone. He wasn't my boyfriend. He was a vast hole of need that took from me anything he deemed worth taking. 

Being with an empty hole made me lonely. Being alone? It is, in a word, wonderful. There is no emptiness because I have filled my life and my time with things I love. He may have someone else already, but he is still empty, will always be empty. A vast void of need."
NarcissisticAbuse,fnm4quk,t3_g2dkbe,1587065070.0,"My therapist says most abusers hoover at some point because of their need to maintain control. I don't believe mine will hoover because he moved on with the woman he was cheating on me with. 

I broke up with him over a month ago. He reached out only one time, a few days after I broke things off, and it was not really what you'd call a hoover. I had him blocked everywhere and he sent an email that went to my spam folder. It was a few lines long and basically said he didn't believe I was at risk for STD's. I didn't respond. 

I have not heard from him since (basically a month), and do not expect to ever hear from him again. He found someone else. Why would he hoover?

I don't believe there's a ""hoover rule."" I do believe that most abusers behave similarly, and employ similar tactics. Most of them will hoover because they essentially feel like they ""own"" you, and don't want to relinquish control. They may not want you back, they may just want to make sure you're pining after them. 

Past actions are usually a reliable predictor of future behavior. If your nex always hoovered in the past, it is likely the person will do it again, unless you made it unequivocally clear you're finished, or if the person is too busy with someone else for you to even enter their mind."
NarcissisticAbuse,fni2qss,t3_g1tjua,1586972987.0,"Nooooo. And no. Just no.

We easily forget our own honeymoon phase, when we were perfect and wonderful in the abuser’s eyes, and everything was roses. And then it was hell and we couldn’t understand how we went from eden to brimstone in the snap of the fingers.

He’s lovebombing her. It will last until he runs out of steam or believes he has her hooked. Then it’s on to the abuse. You’re lucky it’s not you anymore. I know it’s hard to see past the smoke and mirrors of social media but the new victim is just getting his representative, the goody-two-shoes version of the psychopath.

I had a hard time looking past this too. But I had the facts. He abused the two women before me, then me. Did he suddenly become a saint with victim #4 or whatever victim she is? Doubtful. Abusers don’t become saints overnight. Your ex is going to hurt her like he hurt you, and then the next one and the next one. 

Cut him off. Get him out of your phone, email and social media. Block everywhere and focus on yourself. She’s younger? so what. You have more wisdom and experience. She’s hotter? In who’s eyes? Some jackass who hurt you? Stop hurting yourself. Please. He’s hurt you enough. You’re everything you need to be. You just need to be reminded of that because he took it from you. He took your confidence and you can’t build it back up looking at his life and the lie he’s building with someone else."
NarcissisticAbuse,fnc13ll,t3_g0qrd6,1586826410.0,"All his exes were crazy, emotionally unstable, and treated him terribly. He was the victim of terrible taste in women.

He loved all the same things as I did, and couldn’t stop talking about how amazing it was that we had so much in common. It was just “meant to be.”

He wanted to talk on the phone for hours, texted me constantly, and made plans for just about every day of the week.

I was his soulmate. After only two weeks.

He was “in love with me” and imagining our future together in less than a month."
NarcissisticAbuse,fn8guiy,t1_fn88ik8,1586741341.0,"I was going to post exactly this. I was once the new supply, and his ex was forced to see me hanging with her ex and her children, seemingly happy. I was happy for all of three months before the abuse started creeping in. His ex would run into us a lot, and she thought we were happy until one time I ran into her when he wasn’t around and broke down crying. She couldn’t believe how miserable I was because things looked so perfect to an outsider. Behind closed doors he was abusing me emotionally and sexually. He also was cheating, lying and manipulating me. Just as he did to her.

It’s all smoke and mirrors. These people do not change. My therapist said they need to push boundaries further and further to be satisfied, just Iike addicts who need more of a drug to get the same high. We are lucky to have escaped."
NarcissisticAbuse,fn8fb01,t1_fn7hy5c,1586740353.0,"So.... Every day is going to get easier, and you will eventually reach a point where it’s no longer a challenge to avoid him. Right now it’s the hardest because you’re basically addicted to him. It’s like being addicted to a drug, and the only way to feel relief is with a hit. You have to fight through it. I struggled for years to leave. I finally made it out, and today it is almost a month of NC, the longest I’ve ever gone. And I no longer feel compelled to reach out. 

The one thing that really helped (besides therapy) was a list. On day one of NC I made a list of everything I should do when I wanted to contact him. Some days I had to go through the entire list to resist reaching out. But after two weeks I only had to go through a few items on the list. Now I’m not even struggling. I have no urge to contact him. The bond is gone, the addiction broken.

Some examples of activities I would do instead of contacting him included exercising, stretching, meditation, journaling, gardening, a 1,000 piece puzzle, knitting a scarf, listening to a foreign language tape, reading a book, scrubbing every single tile in the shower, calling my aunt, calling my therapist, responding to at least two posts here, learning to make friendship bracelets, learning how to bake blueberry muffins from scratch, and watching a movie. On my worst day I watched the entire Star Wars saga. On another bad day I read a novel, baked, knitted a scarf and spent two hours crying on the phone with family. But I haven’t reached out to him even once. Not a call, text, email. I’ve stayed strong, for the first time ever. And now I don’t even feel the need to reach out. 

My list saved me. It kept me too busy to ruminate. If you’re going to watch movies, stay away from anything you watched with him, and stay away from rom coms. I did lots of sci fi and horror (his least favorite movies). And if movies aren’t your thing, learn a new language.  Foreign language lessons are amazing. You can’t ruminate and learn a new language. Your brain won’t let you. 

Make your list and stay strong. This is no different than deciding not to take drugs or not to gamble away your life savings, or not to smoke cigarettes. You are kicking a habit that can hurt you. Remember you’re choosing to cut toxicity from your life. It’s your health, your well being. You can do this."
NarcissisticAbuse,fn360a7,t1_fn2xr5a,1586613708.0,"I’m so sorry. I’m struggling with being productive.

Making a schedule of things you absolutely must do is really helpful. I make a schedule first thing every morning, otherwise I spend all day here, hoping someone posts something that will make me feel less like a failure in life for spending years with someone who called me names, emotionally and sexually abused me, and cheated on me during a f-cking pandemic.

Be gentle with yourself. And try eating comfort foods, it’s better than eating nothing at all. Waffles are my thing lately. Lots of waffles. Find your comfort food. Your body needs food. Please try to eat."
NarcissisticAbuse,fmyr7db,t1_fmydajm,1586493371.0,"You would have realized it sooner and left sooner of it weren’t for the tactics he was using to keep you there, and subject to his abuse.

One of the best recommendations I’ve gotten from people here is Richard Grannon’s talks on YouTube, in particular, “9 Ways Narcissists abuse People.” It was very painful to watch because it was so familiar, but helps explain how we get drawn in, fooled, and eventually tortured.

I’m sorry for what you’ve been through but it’s over, and every day you’re one step closer to healing, one step closer to a healthier, happier future."
NarcissisticAbuse,fmy5ury,t3_fy16ki,1586478768.0,"Mine did the same. He was messaging a woman he specifically told me wanted him. He then said I couldn’t tell him not to message her because he’s allowed to speak with other people. I was being unreasonable. And needy, clingy, and controlling. I needed to stop being so paranoid and insecure.

One word for what I needed. Therapy.

Part of the problem with these people is that they’ve pushed our boundaries and crossed the line so many times we lose the ability to see the abuse as it’s happening. In my case, he was messaging a woman he knew was actively pursuing him and expressed an interest in dating him. There are no circumstances where responding to her was appropriate. She doesn’t work with him. She’s not a friend of the family. They don’t have a child together. If you’re in a committed monogamous relationship you don’t contact random other people who you know want to f-ck you. That’s common sense. Yet I believed I was the problem. Therapy taught me that I had given up common sense along with my boundaries and self respect.

You ARE enough. You are enough, just as you are right now. 

That’s the truth.

He is a broken human, wires all crossed, pieces disassembled. He cannot be fixed. His issues are not a reflection of some flaw in you, but are evidence of his damaged inner workings. Please believe that.

We can’t fix these people or change them. We can only work hard to guard ourselves from them and others like them. Build your boundaries back up. And hold fast to your standards. Write them down so you remember them the next time someone tries to gaslight you into believing you’re being controlling for being disgusted by their disgusting behavior."
NarcissisticAbuse,fmwwita,t3_fxu0d1,1586454278.0,"Btdt. Therapy really helped. My first session I cried in her office, literally begging her to help me change so I could be enough. Good enough, stable enough, just enough. It took almost two full years of therapy, inconsistent but mostly continuous therapy, for me to leave him. I stopped therapy countless times because I simply could not get past the idea that it was me. My fault, my flaws. He’d intermittently be super charming, saying all the right things, and I would drop my therapist for the week or two or three during the lovebombing, before he started with the lying and name calling and gaslighting all over again. I was right back in the chair within a month, trying to find a way to leave.

What you’re feeling is textbook. Trust your gut. Write down every horrible thing you have endured and look at it. If you see a pattern of abuse, trust the evidence, not your partner’s lies, not your breaking heart. In the end, even he can’t change the facts."
NarcissisticAbuse,fmtu0qn,t3_fxb8c4,1586378990.0,"I’m in the same boat. Alone in a pandemic while he’s off with the new supply. 

Ruminating is totally normal, but you might want to gradually begin distracting yourself when you’re having those constant thoughts about her. It’s not productive and it’s probably stressing you out. Of course telling yourself not to think about purple people eaters will make you think about purple people eaters, but you’ll find certain activities don’t allow much room for ruminating. Give it a shot, at least once a day. Give yourself a well-deserved mental vacation. Watch a good comedy, build something fantastic, learn a foreign language. Just get out of your head once in a while.

And I know it doesn’t mean much, but she’s not happy. I don’t think people like her are capable of happiness. They have two settings: satisfied and unsatisfied. When they’re busy getting fuel, positive or negative, it’s like a gas tank on full, it keeps the car going. The car isn’t happy or unhappy, it’s just operating. When there’s no fuel, the car can’t go. That’s her when she doesn’t have someone to torture or take things from. This new guy has his limits, just like you had yours, and eventually he’s going to stop being a rich source of fuel, the car won’t be able to run, and then it’s on to the next. And the next.

This was never about you. You’re not lacking anything. You didn’t fail. She can’t be satisfied. It’s her. You get to go on and find a real connection with a real human being. She’s stuck as fuel-sucking shell of a person for the rest of her days, never truly knowing what true love or true commitment really are.

Yet it was totally fine when he rolled out of bed, threw on sweatpants and didn’t bother to shave. He was so disgusting.

Our last day together was at the outset of the pandemic and he was complaining that I needed to get dressed and put on makeup. Nothing was f*cking open, no restaurants, not even our local Starbucks. I was working from home. And I couldn’t just enjoy being comfortable. During a f*cking pandemic. I hope his new girl toy gives him an STD."

NarcissisticAbuse,fmrc7fh,t3_fwkfnz,1586319109.0,"This is probably the most valuable relationship advice I have ever read. And it is so painful to realize how many mistakes I made. He shouldn’t have abused me, but I should not have stayed. He was hiding things for so long, and I found myself playing detective so many times. When I’d confront him with the mountain of evidence, I was called paranoid, clingy, insecure. And he would tell me how much he loved me, yet hurt me repeatedly. Cheating. Lying. Constantly moving the goal posts. Stonewalling. But I based my decision to date him on his words, not his actions. I was certain that he loved me because he said so. All the time.

We shouldn’t judge a person by their words, but by what they do to back up all the things they say. It’s crazy how much of a disconnect there was between what he claimed and what he did. It took me too many years to notice. I think I was too busy trying to live up to his impossible standards.

NarcissisticAbuse,fmpj5xs,t3_fwb5p6,1586281783.0,"I don’t think your post is going to be unpopular. It’s your story. It’s what you experienced.

I still believe that if there’s a voice inside you screaming there’s something wrong, you should listen. If you doubt yourself, if you question that voice, you should talk to other people. I’m sorry if you realized at the end it was you, and not your partner. That must be difficult to live with.

I also thought it was me, I ignored my therapists, friends, family and countless red flags. I wanted it to be me because I didn’t want to leave this person I loved so deeply. It took a lot for me to leave. A lot of lies, several incidents of cheating, threats of harm, and towards the end, he drugged me. He claimed it was unintentional. 

Truthfully I envy you. At least if it were me, I could fix it. I could better myself and make it work. I thought it was me for so long I changed my life completely to be his ideal. Better job, improved credit, tons of physical changes, therapy to be more patient, to be more thoughtful, to be more generous. Time management skills. I got a lot out of believing it was me. I have no regrets for the work I put in to be good enough for him. You shouldn’t have regrets either. You’ve clearly grown a lot. There’s much to be said for taking responsibility for the things we’ve done.

NarcissisticAbuse,fmmwl3m,t3_fw1prc,1586213466.0,"If you have time and can afford it, therapy is really helpful. I still question whether it was abuse, so I talk about it constantly because I need the validation so I don’t go back. As much as I sound like a broken record, it is serving a purpose. I’m replaying everything, and it’s helping me to maintain no contact. Talking is a healthy coping mechanism. When I found I was starting to get less than pleasant responses from family and friends, I started coming here more often, and I speak to my therapist more often. 

As far as letting go, it takes time. After almost three full weeks I still have nights I spend tossing and turning, wondering what about me was so terrible that he did the things he did to me. I still cry in the shower. I still don’t have a big appetite. But what I do have are narc-free moments. Lots of them. Whether for five minutes or five hours, I forget about him entirely. Sometimes while watching a show. Or running. Or playing a game. I forget him. I forget the pain and I forget the abuse. That’s what you have to look forward to. Eventual peace."

NarcissisticAbuse,fmighw0,t3_fvdbrh,1586109099.0,"Last year I broke up with my ex. I went back to him after a week because I was such a train wreck that I almost lost my job.

This time, with the pandemic and everything closed, I was able to leave and really mourn the loss of the relationship, or whatever it was that I had with him, because I have nowhere to go, nowhere to be.

Reaching out to your ex right now will take the pain away temporarily. But it’s the very shortest of short term solutions because all that’s waiting for you there is more abuse, the very abuse you wanted to escape when you left. If you allow yourself to feel this pain, and you stay strong, you will get to the other side of this, where there is no abuse, and where you are also healed from missing him. 

Just try to stay busy, try to direct your energy elsewhere, and when it gets really bad come here first and talk to people who have been where you are and can tell you, going back is NOT the answer. Please believe me, you’ll get through this. The pain doesn’t go away all at once, but it lessens with time, and gradually the constant crying and longing will disappear."
NarcissisticAbuse,fmhx0nd,t3_fv4grw,1586096403.0,"Everything you’re feeling is completely normal. The beginning is the hardest, knowing it’s over, knowing you cannot get those years back. But your best years are not gone, and you’re not going to be alone. 42 is not old, not these days. And six months from now, if you work on healing and growing your life outside of the relationship you had, you’ll meet someone new and this pain and loneliness will be a bad memory. Getting from here to there is not an easy process, but you can do it. And you should. 

Last year, when I was trying (unsuccessfully) to leave my abusive relationship, I questioned everything. Who I was without my significant other. Whether I would be alone forever. Whether I was unworthy of anything better. Fear of the unknown drove me back to someone who mistreated me. I robbed myself of a year of my life that could’ve been spent happier and healthier.

She robbed you of twelve years. Do not rob yourself of even a moment. Don’t let her toxicity rob you of even another second. Every moment that you are no longer with someone who is hurting you is a moment you have to heal, to grow, and to build something better.  

Alone is not a curse. It’s not a punishment. It doesn’t mean life is not worth living. It’s lonely, sure. But you’ll find with time that alone is better than abused. It’s better than being hurt. And it’s full of opportunity.

I’m so so sorry she did this to you, but she doesn’t get to rob you of your future. Don’t allow her that, please."
NarcissisticAbuse,fmhqh1g,t1_fmhmxq5,1586090387.0,"I understand. I loved mine, too. Deeply. To the point that I allowed him to burn every boundary I had, cross every line I set, and essentially rob me of everything that mattered to me. I spent the first few days after I left him wondering if I should have waited until after the pandemic was over to leave, and regretting that I didn't leave sooner, when there would have been so much more in my life to distract me.

But the answer is, there is no better time than now. I am completely isolated, but being completely isolated means having the space and opportunity to heal, without having to pull myself together while at work, or pretend to be ok when I am not. I can cry when I need to, go for a long run when I need to, throw myself into my work when I need to, or spend an hour here reading posts and remembering why I left him. There is a total freedom to being isolated and alone. I have been forced, with endless hours without him, to see what I was really living with, what I was really allowing to happen to me, and what I gave up to be in that relationship. I am lonely AF, but growing and healing faster than I ever would have under other circumstances.

Take a moment right now and make a list of all the ways you can feel better that don’t involve reaching out to him. Maybe you need to call your friends, or go for a run, or hug your pet or knit a sweater. But think it over and write it down. And every time your resolve weakens, go to that list and pick an activity. If one isn’t enough, then two. Or three. There might be times you need to do everything on the list twice just to stay NC. But it doesn’t matter. What matters is giving yourself enough time to heal so that in a few weeks you’re not going to need that list quite as much.

NarcissisticAbuse,fm8l70p,t3_ftobgi,1585851382.0,"Ended it over two weeks ago when I caught him cheating again.

At first it was really hard being alone. As time passed, I slowly started to appreciate all the things that disappeared with him...

Fighting nearly every day. About everything.
Feeling hurt and stressed every time I caught him lying. Which was all the time. He’d lie about the time of day if I didn’t have a clock nearby.
Having to listen to him talk about all the other women he could be with.
Gaslighting.
Future faking.
Constant criticism. The day before I ended things with him he was complaining to me that I don’t spend enough time on myself, I should wear more makeup, dress nicer. I was home that day in my pjs working on my computer because the office was closed due to the pandemic. I had been up since 5 in the morning trying to put out little fires and he was b!tching at me about how I looked. Wtf.
I need makeup to work on the couch?
The terrible, miserable sex. He liked to pretend he was in one of his porn movies. The things he said.... I can’t even.
Paying for everything. I don’t miss paying for every f@cking thing. Food. Hotel rooms. Alcohol. Clothes he wanted.

Wow. Not sure why I was ever with him but the foolish girl he’s dating now can have every last lousy moment with him. I’m so glad I’m free.

He reached out at first. Has since gone silent, probably forever. Good riddance to bad rubbish."
NarcissisticAbuse,fm7pdjc,t3_fth37z,1585833752.0,"I have somewhat of a friendship with his ex wife. He is still in her life because they share kids, so at times it can be complicated. She will let slip things I’d rather not know about him because they interfere with my healing, but for the most part our interactions are responsible for my ability to leave him. Because of her stories, her own experiences, I know the abuse was not about me, had never been about me. None of us are perfect but having imperfections does not justify the abuse they inflict. A better person would just walk away, not try to train their partner like a circus animal.

He behaved the same exact way with her as he did with me, from the sexual abuse, to the emotional abuse, to the compulsive lying and the gaslighting. Realizing he could not change in their decade long marriage helped me to come to terms that he never would have changed for me. He may change for someone else, but the pattern tells me I would never have been the person he became kind and loving for.

He’s with someone else now, and when I feel jealous or hurt I remind myself that the lovebombing is likely temporary, and what follows is torture. And I’m lucky it’s not me."
NarcissisticAbuse,fm6ps1q,t1_fm5tosn,1585799903.0,"Wow. I don’t realize this was common. Even the TV watching. He had saved movies on the DVR. We’d watch them over and over. It was like Groundhog Day. Every day the same, an almost exact schedule with little room for deviation.  Even the sex. He would initiate sex the exact same way every time. He even had certain behaviors right beforehand that essentially signaled what type of intimacy he wanted. 

He was incredibly strict about every aspect of our lives...what you had to do every time you walked in the door, how you prepared food in the kitchen, how you cleaned. There was little room for error. 

Sometimes I liked the routine. Other times it was stifling. There just wasn’t any margin for error. Simply putting out the wrong plates for a meal could trigger a bad mood. Forgetting certain rituals before getting into bed meant intimacy could be downright awful. And making any noise in the morning before he announced he was ready to wake up could ruin an entire day. Sometimes I just couldn’t wait to leave. The amount of things I had to keep track of was stressful, and by the end of a full weekend together I was frazzled, exhausted and ready to weep.

He’s all I’ve known for years, and now that it’s over all I can do is hope that it won’t be this way with someone else. It was like walking a tightrope 24/7, always trying to maintain the balance, living in constant dread of the inevitable fall."
NarcissisticAbuse,fm2ov3h,t3_frt7ye,1585702041.0,"This was me. For YEARS. I would leave and go back, leave and go back. Over and over. This is the first time I’ve been successful in maintaining NC. When I left this time, I blocked him on everything. He used a new email address to contact me and for the first time EVER I stayed strong. The first five days were torture, especially when he reached out, and especially because I’m in a region overcome with the virus and everything here is closed. There is very little to do to distract myself. But here’s how I made it through the first two weeks...
- Exercise. Lots of it. And yoga, meditation and stretching. All for endorphins. They’re the “feel good” hormone.
- Sunlight every day for at least an hour, unless it’s raining, for dopamine and serotonin, mood regulators that also play a role in your sleep cycle.
- Hugs. Lots of hugs. If you don’t have anyone there to hug, give yourself little acts of self love. A hot bath. A home cooked meal. Or Laughter. All of these releases oxytocin, the “cuddle” hormone. You’re missing it terribly because you’re not getting physical connection from the ex. Find other healthy ways to get it. 
- Eating well and sleeping regularly. Keep your blood sugar steady and your mind alert.
- Therapy. Call a DV hotline if you don’t have the money for a therapist. They’re amazing. I’ve called more than once when I couldn’t find anyone else to talk to.
- Most importantly, I have a list of things to do when I feel like I’m going to break and contact him. This is crucial. Have a plan. For me it’s call a friend. If that’s not enough, come here for support. If I’m still feeling like I’m going to break down, I read my list of the ten most awful things he did, and then add to it. At this point it’s now pages of the things he did to hurt me, so when I feel myself breaking I first have to read several pages of just how horrible he was. It’s scary what I allowed in my life for years. 
When all else fails, I workout like crazy.
Make yourself a plan for when you feel your resolve slipping.

You CAN do this. You can. Just try. Forget about forever, just try for one day. And if you make it through that day, try for another day. Just keep trying. One moment at a time. One day at a time. You’re not alone."
NarcissisticAbuse,fm0mdx3,t1_fm0fglw,1585661506.0,"Thank you so much for writing this. We ARE more than our biological wiring. 

It helps to know that that what is going on inside in when you leave someone who abused you has more to do with chemicals in your body than anything else. I know that for me, the craving that I had for him after I left made me feel ashamed and confused. He had hurt me repeatedly for years. Why did I still feel like I needed him? Wanted him?

The answer is not about logic. It is chemicals, just as you said. And the longer I am away, the more I feel like myself. And the less I want to see him again. 

But on tough days I need that reminder of why I feel driven to call or text or email him. My therapist has told me many times that making contact WILL bring relief, just like for an addict who finally gets a fix. But that relief is only temporary, and pales in comparison to the pain the abuser will inflict with rejection. And then you have to start all over, resetting your body and ""getting clean."" I know my body has been wired to want him, but eventually that will fade, and then disappear."
NarcissisticAbuse,fm0d3x1,t1_fm073do,1585653893.0,"It gets better. Every day you remain NC it gets better. The first few days, it feels awful. The craving for connection, the need to hear his voice, the desire to go back no matter the cost, it is all going to fade a little each day. If you stay NC, truly NC, the hold he has on you will slowly loosen. I am speaking from experience, as it will be two weeks for me tomorrow, and I sobbed uncontrollably for the first five days. I still think of him every day, but the sadness has abated, the anxiety has slowly lessened, and I can go hours now without thinking of him at all.

Block him. Don’t check his social media. Remove reminders of him from your personal space. Stick to a routine as much as possible. If you think you might break NC come here first, there are so many people here who have been where you are. You can do this. Just take it nice and slow, focus on the present, and realize you are giving yourself a precious gift that the future you will be forever grateful for."
NarcissisticAbuse,flyzfmo,t3_frw64p,1585612255.0,"This is my life right now. I caught him cheating (again) at the outset of the pandemic. It was worse than all the previous times because this time it wasn’t about me worrying about STD’s, but about a virus that could hurt my child who has health issues, my parents who are aging. When he chose to drive to another woman’s house and climb in her bed, he put the people I love at risk, and it was devastating to me that he could care so little for our well being. I left him. For good.

He emailed a few times in the first week. I thought about responding. But in the end, I realized he just wanted the last word. So I let him have it. I didn’t respond to a single email. He has since stopped contacting me.
 
The silence is sweet. I don’t need to ask why. I don’t need to hear his excuses. His choice to cheat was all the closure I’ll ever need."

I have another friend who had her second child last year at 46. Women have children well into their forties. It may not be ideal, but the ability to have children past 35 actually exists, so don’t feel like your uterus is a ticking time bomb.

As for “wasted time,” I’m in the same boat. Lots of years lost on a cheating, lying, manipulative pr!ck.

I’m in therapy, and I’ll share what I’ve learned about time wasted....
The time was not wasted, unless you allow it to be a waste. You’ve probably learned from the relationship exactly what you don’t want. You learned what red flags look like. You likely learned that when your partner tells you something that doesn’t ring true, you need to trust that feeling in your gut that’s telling you something isn’t right.

Life is short. Time flies. But maybe this cheater had to waste a few years of your life so that the Mr. Right that you’re supposed to wind up with had time to become the amazing person he is now, to end his own toxic relationship. It wasn’t time wasted. It was the universe keeping you busy, giving you wisdom, until it was the right time for Mr. Right.

NarcissisticAbuse,flqzt18,t3_fq4w3r,1585409944.0,"This was my life for years.

I established early on that I was dating with the hopes of a long-term relationship that would lead to marriage. I was very clear about that. He told me he wanted the same. And proceeded to change his mind constantly, practically every other month, always with the same words when I became upset: ""I'm allowed to change my mind."" 

Yes, you are allowed to change your mind. But when it comes to long-term plans, you don't get to string people along. We all have a finite amount of time on this planet. No one should keep you hanging around, pretending you have a future together, when they know you're just a bookmark. A space saver. A temp. It's selfish and sick. And typical narc behavior.

I also know that not a single kind word would come out of his mouth right now, even if I broke NC. I left him. And when I did I emailed him every horrible thought I had about him. He took the high road, wished me well. Despite the horrible things I had said. Then again why would he need to be upset with me, he was the one going directly from my bed to someone else’s bed, in the same damn day, in the middle of a global pandemic, with not a single f*cking thought for my health or hers. 

I don’t miss him as much as much as I miss having someone on my life. But he’s a walking disease so I’m better off alone. Or so I tell myself. This sucks. Life just really sucks.

Unless your ex and the new victim are living on an ark in the middle of the ocean with a year of supplies, the primary motivators in life right now are food, shelter and staying healthy. No one is going to put up with his drama or his demands for attention. Life is too chaotic right now for that. Trust me when I tell you, as lonely as you feel, you are better off. He will be alone soon enough, and miserable because his kind cannot abide the loneliness. Stay strong, and reach out if you need to talk. But do not contact him.

NarcissisticAbuse,fld2s54,t3_fnz7bh,1585055022.0,"I imagine it hurts, but here’s two reasons why you DON’T want the N to reach out. 

The relationship with the N is a little bit like a drug addiction. The N is the drug, and when you first get away (through escape or discard) your body goes into withdrawal, and the only thing that takes the pain away is the N. The longer you are away and have no contact, the more your body returns to normal. You kick the addiction, and the painful craving for the N fades to a bearable ache. Contact, for most people who have been in this kind of relationship with all of its highs and lows, is like a hit of heroin. A line of cocaine. You are clean now. The pain you feel from not getting a text or email is a bit like an alcoholic craving a drink, an addict craving drugs. It’s normal. You’ve been strong. STAY STRONG. Don’t be dragged back into the addiction. There’s nothing good for you there.

Almost as important is the fact that no contact means no abuse. No emotional roller coaster. No gaslighting, future faking, crazy making conversations, false accusations. You are in a good place. A toxic person has been extracted from your life, along with all the toxic issues that person brings with them.

Our world is chaotic right now. Appreciate the absence of the chaos the N brings with them. They’re lovers of drama, and whatever brief relief they may bring with contact will quickly devolve into the chaos they carry with them to every relationship.

I am alone too. I’m scared and lonely. But I know this will make me stronger. More resilient. I know I’m better off without the abuse. So are you.

Stay safe."
ptsd,fl3o4zp,t1_fl34i6h,1584792646.0,"You are not “nothing.” And yes, it hurts to be transformed by trauma, sometimes more than the trauma itself, but that does not make you nothing. Over time you’ll find who this new person is that you’ve become, and you’ll realize that you are strong, resilient, a survivor. Letting go of who you were before does not mean you’re “nothing.” Please, do not ever feel that way. We lose so much in trauma, don’t let yourself lose your value. You are something. Something amazing because you survived, and YOU get to decide who you are now. Not based on labels your friends try to tell you once defined you. Based on who YOU believe yourself to be. Based on who you want to be."
NarcissisticAbuse,fl3h239,t3_fm7h0j,1584783601.0,"I think this is called reactive abuse. It’s one more way an abusive person tries to control you - by controlling your responses to the situation. My ex would lie to my face about things he KNEW he would get caught lying about, and I would react with screaming, crying and slamming doors. I do not typically behave this way. This is how I behave when someone puts my health in danger by having sex with other people while dating me. Eventually I realized (after years of his lying, eventual cheating, and constant manipulation, as well as years of therapy) that the cycle wouldn’t stop unless I stopped being a part of it. 

The abuser might say that you have a choice in how you behave, but it’s not really that simple. Abuse is an imbalance of power. The abuser uses various tactics to control you, and keep all that power. This is one of the ways the abuser controls you - controlling your behavior, your reaction to things. You are being provoked. If you’re going to stay in the relationship you need to teach yourself to wait before responding to their behaviors. Learn to hit the internal pause button. Think about what is happening, try to recognize when you’re being intentionally provoked, and respond calmly. Don’t let the abuser win.

The best thing to do is leave. But it’s also the hardest, and not always an option.

He risked countless people for his own pleasure. It’s hard waking up alone, going through this alone, but it would’ve been so much harder continuing to share myself with someone who has so little respect for the lives of the people around him.

Thanks for the reminder that there is a bright side. He wasn’t there today to tell me to dress nicer, wear more makeup, fix my hair. 
He wasn’t there to criticize my every decision. To put down My friends, my family, my kids.
He wasn’t there to tell me how gorgeous or brilliant or successful all his female colleagues are, or to comment on which woman someone thought he should date because he pretends to be single on his social networking.

NarcissisticAbuse,fi58i28,t3_f6b304,1582157311.0,"All of this. All of it.
I don’t know if I could have survived his tactics without therapy, and without someone telling me every week that this type of behavior is NOT normal and NOT healthy.
Mine would deliberately act in ways that would make me feel insecure and jealous, so that I’d constantly be trying to figure out what was going on, and then he’d criticize me about my insecurity and jealousy.

In a healthy relationship, your partner will take steps to alleviate your insecurities, not feed them.

If your partner is hiding their phone all the time, sneaking away to make calls, disappearing and giving you inconsistent stories about their whereabouts, talking incessantly about someone else or telling you that there’s someone really hot or amazing at work or school but “you don’t have to worry” ... those behaviors are going to cause you concern. Your concern or mistrust is a normal response to abnormal behavior. Don’t be gaslit into believing you’re insecure when your partner is hiding things. A healthy degree of privacy is one thing. Acting shady is another. Trust your gut."
NarcissisticAbuse,fi2c7i8,t3_f5tew0,1582076375.0,"The times that I left him, I felt completely drained. So much of my energy went into questioning myself and my experiences with him, whether I had made a mistake leaving, if he was really abusive. I kept going back, and then felt disappointed in myself for all the times I went back to him, as he once again he violated my boundaries, lied to my face, spread rumors about me, and manipulated me.

I know you may not see it now, but what you did was huge. You left. For real, left. I know I’m not alone in saying that it’s something I desperately wanted to do that I never accomplished. In the end, he had to leave me. Because me leaving lasted only hours or days. He had to leave me for good for me to be free.

You are strong in a way so many people are not, and I hope you can look in the mirror and see that. You ARE strong. It hurts and may continue to hurt as you heal, but soon enough this place you’re in, wondering and ruminating and feeling sad, is going to be a distant memory. Find small ways to thank yourself every day. Take hot baths with lots of bubbles, drink tons of water. Sleep and sleep and sleep. Exercise or do yoga. Meditate. Just find small ways to show yourself that you are a strong, amazing human being that accomplished something incredibly difficult. You will get through this. Let yourself grieve. But find time for happiness too, whether it’s a silly movie, playing with a puppy, gardening, or reorganizing your closet to perfection.

This is going to pass. A few years ago I lost someone I loved to illness, and thought I’d never be able to stop grieving. The grief seemed to be never ending. Until it wasn’t. This will pass. It will. And when it does you’ll be even stronger than you are now. Just give yourself time to heal. Have patience with yourself. And talk to a therapist if you can."
NarcissisticAbuse,fi27v9e,t3_f5ujip,1582073497.0,"Scary how familiar this is. He was grooming the new supply while I was trying desperately to be everything he kept saying I wasn’t. I think the hardest part was knowing. I knew there was someone else. He denied it vehemently but was always hiding his phone, suddenly ending phone calls when I was in earshot, telling me the same story he had just told me (clearly forgetting he had already told me but had not told her). So many, many signs there was someone else, and the more obvious it became, the harder I worked. We would break up, get back together, break up again. He clearly didn’t know if she was a “sure thing” so he’d start fights with me to have time with her, then make up with me to keep stringing me along. I started fights with him, too, just wanting it to finally end. I was relieved when it ended. I just couldn’t take his constant lies, him blaming me for his bad behavior when he needed a break from me to be with her. 

The gaslighting really threw me for a loop, but when it finally ended I knew exactly why he was ending it, and that blaming me was just a cover for his lies and cheating. He needed an excuse to get rid of me so he made one. I am sad but the moment I knew it was over, that he was fully invested in her, it was like my heart was set free from a cage, like my lungs were released from a vice grip. I needed him to end it, to move on, so I could let go. Because I had tried to let go for years but kept going back. I am sad, but I feel like I’ve been given a gift.

I didn’t realize what was happening to me on my own, I was told by a therapist. And another. And another.

I didn’t leave him though. It took over two more years, and some pretty horrible moments, for me to leave for good.

During that time I was constantly filled with doubt about whether I deserved the things he said and did to me.

But this week, when I left, I knew something had to change. On my first day of NC, my doubt felt like it was choking me, and I was forced to make a decision - one that has kept me from questioning myself and from going back to him. 

I decided that i don’t need to put a label on who he is or what he did to me, for me to leave him and know that leaving is the only choice I have. I don’t need a label, and I don’t need anyone’s validation.

On that first day of NC, as I struggled not to call and beg him to take me back,  I singled out the worst thing he ever did to me in all the years that we were together and I asked myself, if a man did this to my daughter, what would I tell her?

NarcissisticAbuse,fgj5zyx,t3_eyrcix,1580837625.0,"Every time I ever walked out, ever tried to leave him, he called me a quitter. When he’d sit me down to tell me why the relationship would never move forward, why I was at fault for the stagnation, for the tension, for everything he excluded me from in his life, he’d preface the conversation with , “I’m sure you’re going to storm out, that’s what you always do.” So leaving him feels like quitting. It feels like storming out. It feels like proving him right.

I am a coward because I didn’t really leave. I baited him until he was angry and ready for it to be over. I couldn’t just leave him, so I made sure it was mutual, saying what I had to so that he wouldn’t want me.

I’m a coward. But I couldn’t take anymore of the intimacy that left me feeling empty, used and violated. I couldn’t take the lies. The last minute cancellations. The list of things I’ve done wrong that deserve punishing. I had started to wish he would push me off a cliff just to end how bad he made me feel everyday. 

I feel guilty for quitting. I feel guilty for not being strong enough to take it. I feel guilty for baiting him into a fight just so I’d never have to take my clothes off for him again. I feel like I should have been better. Done more. Been enough. I’m questioning everything.

I just know if I stayed I would fall apart. The every day digs, abuse, lies, gaslighting. I was dying inside every day. There was almost nothing left of me."

We saw each other last night. I started a fight, on purpose, said what I needed to say to get him to break up with me. I’m praying I never hear from him again because I don’t know if I have the willpower to stay NC. But I do know I can’t go back. I felt so violated. Just being next to him after what happened, I could hardly stand it. All I want now is to be left alone. I couldn’t sleep at all last night. I could only replay what he did, and how terrible it made me feel. I know it sounds crazy. He didn’t force me. He just did things I asked him not to do."

NarcissisticAbuse,ffyd7xs,t1_ffy8v8y,1580343637.0,"I can relate. 

I always thought it was called ""crazy making.""

I would wind up screaming and sending crazy, marathon-long texts for hours.

Afterwards I was so ashamed. 

But even more ashamed because I stayed and allowed him to push me over the edge. It was hard to even fool myself about what he was doing, as it was so BLATANT. He enjoyed making me act crazy.

On one occasion I asked him to stop saying certain things when we were intimate because they made me uncomfortable. He promised he would stop, but he didn't. So I asked a second time. Again, he promised to stop but did it again. That time I sent a whole bunch of nasty texts and HE GOT MAD AT ME ABOUT IT, and claimed he couldn't change his behavior when I was making him angry with all my texts. So I waited a while, was on perfect behavior, and then asked a third time. Again, he promised to stop but he didn't. We had another huge fight. Things were escalating. So the following night, I chose to broach the subject IMMEDIATELY BEFORE we were intimate, so there was no possibility at all that he could forget. I'm talking MINUTES beforehand. He STILL DID IT. And when I brought it up as it was happening, he was completely unapologetic. He told me that he wouldn't change his behavior because I had not changed mine. And he proceeded to tell me what I needed to do in order for him to stop doing something I had been asking him to stop doing for the longest time. 

I blew up, screaming that he had no right to be intimate with me when I had asked him to stop doing something I didn't want, and if he wasn't capable of stopping he shouldn't touch me. Of course, more nasty texts followed after I went home and relived everything in my head, and was raging at how violated I felt.

I should have left when he kept pushing my boundaries. Instead I allowed it to happen, kept returning, and sent dozens of awful messages he used to prove to everyone he knows that I am unstable. F\*CKING Hell."

Where once we'd talk until two in the morning about anything and everything, over time it became three minute conversations, primarily about him, mostly repeating things about his ex or his boss or his kids that I had already heard twenty times.

I'm sorry he used your illness against you.

Mine used private family stories to humiliate me. He'd repeat things about my parents at dinner parties, that I had told him in confidence. When he'd do it, I'd sit there, turning beet red and wishing the floor would swallow me. 

You are no one's property. If you want to be done with him, walk away and don't look back. He does not deserve you, and you do not deserve to be treated this way."

This same, seemingly wonderful person has threatened to hit me. Called me terrible names. Lied to my face. Pursued other women behind my back. He's done things during intimacy that I've repeatedly asked him not to do. Pulled my hair so hard I cried out in pain, grabbed my arm so tight it left bruises.

Yet despite all of this, I  still cannot shake the belief that I am somehow imagining everything because how could someone so seemingly perfect hurt me, abuse me, love bomb and discard me over and over again.

NarcissisticAbuse,ffn5nwq,t1_ffm0esd,1580062273.0,"Totally agree.

He love bombed me in the beginning and I grew accustomed to the constant attention. Then he withdrew it, bit by bit, managing down my expectations.  
If ever sought any of the attention I originally received, or made any comment about it, I was called ""needy"" and ""clingy,"" ""insecure"" and ""emotionally unstable.""

It was a TOTAL mind\*ck because he was the one constantly texting and calling in the early stages, and so I thought that was how things were supposed to be. When it all stopped, I had grown so used to it I didn't really know how to feel about it being completely gone, so I kept trying to get it back.

This place saved my sanity. I had really grown to believe all the terrible things he called me. If I cried when he was hurtful, or got angry at the way he treated me, I was ""psycho."" He could ignore me for days, uninvite from events, cancel on me last minute, and if I so much as batted an eye I was such a terrible person. SO unreasonable.

It took me way too long to understand that it was all about power. I wish I'd found this place sooner. Maybe would've walked away less damaged."
NarcissisticAbuse,ffggx1a,t1_fff0qvj,1579905975.0,"Almost always. His inability to commit or follow through was really all encompassing. To the point that I gave no credit to any thing he said.

""I'll text you before bed"" meant he wouldn't text at all, or text something like, ""hope all good. sleep well,"" at like 3 in the morning when he knew I had been asleep for hours. My personal favorite? ""We will move in together next year."" That one I heard every six or seven months. Always another year. Next year. Next year. Next year. 

It took me a lot of years to truly recognize the BIG SECRET. I thought it was me. I wasn't good enough. I wasn't smart enough, hot enough, successful enough. If I just tried harder, did more, gave more, he would stop cancelling plans, stop moving the goalposts. 

Nope. It was not about me as a person. It was about controlling me. He had complete control over every minute of my day because he gave me total uncertainty. I never knew if he'd call or text. I never knew if he would see me or cancel plans. I didn't know if it was going to be one of those days with a dozen sweet, adorable messages followed by a great dinner after work and lots of attention, or if it would be radio f\*cking silence for three or five days straight, followed by him finally contacting me asking me to come over so I could pay for dinner and service him sexually. 

He made me a slave to uncertainty. 

But really he did me a favor. Because I finally figured out that I was just as likely to be treated like dirt whether I spent five grand on a vacation or told him to f\*ck off. No amount of good deeds, kind words, or patience made him call me or not call me, text me or not text me, see me or cancel on me.

His favorite thing in the world was to manufacture drama when he didn't feel like spending time with me, so he could say things were tense and we needed space.  

He also used the fact that he had children to NEVER make solid plans. Even though he had a set schedule with his ex and didn't have his kids all the time. He'd say ""I can't FULLY commit because something might come up with the kids.""

My response was always that it was fine, I understood that emergencies come up and you have to cancel plans when your kids need you. But he started telling me he couldn't commit to ANYTHING because an emergency could happen at ANY time. No dinner reservations. No movie tickets. No comedy shows.

BUT . . .  if I was paying for a vacation or an expensive outing, then all of a sudden he was all in. No worries. Kids will be fine. But every day dinner plans? No way. If it cost less than a few hundred dollars he wasn't committing to it."

Our love languages were the same - quality time and physical affection. I was wowed by how perfect we were for each other. I had met my soul mate.

He danced with me in the kitchen.

He brushed my hair out of my face as we cuddled next to each other in bed.

He had a playlist on his phone of all my favorite songs, and would play them when we were together in bed, just to show me how much he ""knew"" me.

Reading this chilled me to the bone. 

Because I was not special.  

I have no doubt your ex is not mine. But it's so deeply disturbing to know they are all so similar, all using the same tactics, all singing the same tune.

Someone here once called it the narcissist playbook. Maybe it really DOES exist.

At the time I would be so overwhelmed with trying to figure out what was  really going on, to wrap my head around the nonsensical conversations and total word salad, that I couldn't identify it as abuse. I was just trying to figure out WTF was happening.

I can't say that it was the ""magic pill"" that set everything straight in my head and immediately led me out of the abuse, but it made a world of difference. She gave me back my sanity, and she helped me through some really dark times.

I wish I could put into words what you did for this woman, but I don't want to hijack your post. I just thought you should know from someone who received this same generosity, that whether she stays NC or not, what you did changed EVERYTHING for her. Being a victim is SO isolating. Thinking you did something to deserve being a victim is even more isolating, because you feel both alone AND damaged.

But self-improvement is about identifying things we can do better, and coming up with a plan to achieve an identifiable goal or goals. ""Fixing"" implies that you are broken, and you are not.  

Unfortunately, we have been sailing in the same boat.  I, too, have been dealing with the nex's laundry list of things he asked me to fix. And I was so preoccupied with all the fixing, I ceased living. I slowly lost all of my friends, close family relationships, hobbies, interests.  I became preoccupied with fixing me. Fixing my supposed mental and emotional instability. Intimacy issues. My job. My finances.  My body. My clothing. My speaking habits. The way I clean the kitchen floor when I spill something. The way I fold the towels. How I argue. How I speak to people. How I speak about myself.  I was literally prohibited from making certain comments and when I did, I was told I had used my ""quota"" of mistakes for the day.  

But I also feel like leaving is the hardest f\*cking thing in the universe. What do we do about this?  
I, for one, am rediscovering my interests. Slowly but surely. I forgot that I had any. But I do. I like things. Things that he doesn't like and will never like. In fact, I am pretty sure I hate a lot of the things we did together. So now I am figuring out what I like. What kinds of clothing. Food. Hobbies. I am finding myself. And it is a time consuming process that distracts me from the loneliness. Because figuring out who the f\*ck you are after living in the box someone else locked you in for several years is a pretty involved process. Embrace it. Fully. It will help ease the pain. 

Leaving IS hard. Crazy hard. But being yourself is so easy. Getting up in the morning and eating what you want to eat, dressing how you want to dress, speaking how you want to speak. It's pretty great. It may not make up for the pain you're feeling, but if you try to embrace the freedom, just a little bit, it may lift that weight you feel on your chest, on your heart, just a little bit."

How warped your mind is that you seemingly don't know up from down. That he/she just will never validate you in the ways you need. That you gave up a lot for this person. That you are fearful. I understand the psychological torment and horror you are living under. I know the gaslighting and lying has flipped your world upside down. I know that underneath all this chaos and confusion you know you need to get out. You are correct.

I didn't know how much I needed these words until I read them. I've been NC for 48 hours. Seems like the longest 48 hours of my life, and after tossing and turning all night for the past 2 nights, I am beyond exhausted and my mind is definitely warped. The only thing that has kept me from crawling back is my phone, and the memos stored in my phone from the years of abuse. Notes about the gaslighting, the name calling, the boundary testing, moving the goal posts. Notes about the time he called me a f\*cking idiot, over and over, notes about his lies, notes about him threatening to hit me. One of the notes, written over a year ago, begins: ""You've been writing yourself notes for years, let this be the note that counts. Walk away before you lose anymore than you've already lost.""

A year later I was still with him. Still crying myself to sleep on the nights he refused to see me. Still missing work because I was too emotionally drained to get dressed in the morning. Still anxiously waiting for the next lie, the next sign he was cheating, the next goal post he would move, claiming if I was better things would move forward. If I did x or y or z, we would finally live together.

I left. But I am exhausted. And miserable. And I still want to go back. But I'm taking it one minute at a time. Just one more minute of no contact. Just one, and I am that much closer to moving on.

Thank you so much for posting this. You are right, as long as I am next to the narc I will not have a good life. Just more years of jumping through hoops and crawling through dirt, only to be told I am still not enough. I will never be enough. He will never love me. Please let me get through one more hour. One more day. Please let me be strong enough to stay away for good this time."
NarcissisticAbuse,fe5vig4,t3_enqzzd,1578875878.0,"Been there.  SO BEEN THERE. Mine told me he wanted to get engaged, live together, get married. Long story short, he constantly moved the goal posts. At first, he claimed I had to change. He told me that I needed a better job, more financial stability, to be in therapy, to be more responsible. He gave me a literal laundry list of things that I had to do, and then we could move forward with our relationship. Over several years time, I completed his little list, and then there was a new list, and another list, until he ran out of things for me to change and told me that it was actually HIM. That HE wasn't ready to commit until he accomplished his own little list of x, y and z with his life.

I finally left. I don't know FOR SURE that there was another woman, but most people suggested there probably was, given the fact that he excluded me from much of his life, insisted that I couldn't come around his home at certain times, hid his phone from me all the time, and was on dating apps and facebook singles groups. I don't have rock solid proof, just a boat load of circumstantial evidence.

Facing the reality that I was not the one for him was seriously traumatic. But I will tell you what his ex-wife told me. YOU DODGED A BULLET. It may not seem like it right now, when the wound is fresh and painful and you're still a$$ deep in the trauma bond. But think about what he did to you. He stringed you along, and then chose someone else. Not because the other person is better than you or more than you, or because there is anything inherently wrong with you. NO. Your narc found a better victim. Someone more pliant, someone with lower standards, someone less aware of his real self.

That is not an indication of any flaw in you. It's an indication that you were too strong for him to try to pin you down into a one-sided, abusive arrangement. It hurts, I know it does because I'm going through this, too. But we are the lucky ones. The ones who have not been bled dry by blood sucking, selfish leeches. We get to move on. We get to find true partners, partners who will meet us halfway, who will compromise, partners who will return our love with true love of their own. This person you pine after will come back, looking for all the juicy supply you once provided. Be strong, stay NC, and know that there is someone better out there, waiting for you to come along."

I have been calling everyone today trying to get some validation that I didn't imagine the abuse. I am scared that it is me. That his behavior is my fault. I am scared that I am a narcissist. That I am a terrible person that brought out the worst in him.

And I hate that this keeps happening. That I get up the strength and resolve to leave, and once I end it with him, I start thinking it was all me. That I caused his behavior. That I deserved his behavior. I don't even know what is real. I can remember him being sweet, patient, kind, generous. And I question whether he ever hurt me.

I am trying desperately not to contact him, trying to trust myself. 

After YEARS of us being together, he insists that I can only see him when he wants to see me. Sometimes that means I see him for an entire weekend, and we have hours and hours together, just the two us. And things are wonderful. We are happy. But then sometimes I am not allowed to see him for days or even a week. He tells me that it's normal, that just because other relationships aren't like ours, it doesn't mean something is wrong. That we should use our time apart to focus on other things -- our jobs, our families. He says being apart is a good thing. Even though we have been together for years, he still excludes me from his life for days or a week because it is what he wants. But it's not what I want. I don't want to be excluded for five days. Or seven days. It hurts to be told I am not welcome at his house, that I can't come over for whatever reason. And when I tell him that being excluded from his life makes me feel hurt or unwanted, he makes me feel selfish, clingy, annoying, possessive, insecure. Is it all me? What is normal? Is this normal? I don't know. He lies a lot. I wonder if there is another woman. I wonder if I am just a thing he keeps around for when he has nothing else to do, and no one else to see.

It seems like it should be ok for him to make up these rules. If I was what he wanted me to be, I wouldn't be excluded from his life, right? I don't know. I don't know what the F&CK normal is. I don't know what abuse is. I don't know anything. The doubt is strangling me. I literally feel like I m choking on it.

Not trying to mix metaphors here, but for me it's like venturing out into the wild. Or a desert. I can only get far enough, where I can still see my way back to where I started, or, in real life terms, where there is still the possibility of going back. I've never ventured far enough for it to be a ""done deal."" For me, it's like trying to walk far enough in the wilderness that I can no longer see civilization.

Any advice on letting go of the fear? 

I have worked hard on making my own life. A life that exists outside of the relationship, with activities I do on my own, people I see that don't know him or know about the abuse. I've created this little pocket of sanity for myself. But it's not enough to carry me through the unknown. I don't know how to traverse the unknown.

But somehow having things in writing was not enough, which frustrates me to no end. Even when we have an agreement, in an email or a text message, what we agree to only matters when its convenient for HIM. He holds me to every single word that comes out of my mouth, but he can change his mind all the time. About everything.

If I agree to something, I can't get an inch, but if he agrees to something, he will talk circles around me until I am crying and hating myself, because I feel like I've done something wrong holding him to his word. Somehow expecting him to keep his promises and plans makes me selfish and clingy and insecure."
NarcissisticAbuse,fc58jh7,t3_eg986j,1577448638.0,"I hate that it brings out the worst in me.  I went to group therapy before the holidays. We went around the room talking about shame. What makes you feel shame. And as I talked about the shame I feel when I react to his behavior, I realized just how much I am doing just that -- reacting.  

He ghosts me for days at a time. No texts, phone calls, emails. It's like I suddenly don't exist. And it always follows us spending an intense amount of one-on-one time together. So it's like I've spent a week basking in the bright sun, only to be dropped into the middle of Antarctica. And I react. Sometimes after a day, sometimes after five days. But eventually I give in, and I send walls of texts in response to his silence. Walls of desperate, pleading texts. So when we talked about shame in therapy, that was my shame -- That I am a full grown adult that can't manage to behave properly when someone completely ignores me. 

My walls of text are not normal or acceptable, any more than his silent treatment. The worst part is that my walls of text don't actually take away the pain of being ignored for five or six days. And whenever he finally breaks the silence in response to my long rants, I feel even worse than when I was being ignored. He inevitably blames me, or accuses me of being paranoid, clingy, insecure and unstable. 

I honestly don't even know what normal is anymore. Does anyone else feel that way? Apparently being completely ignored for a week by someone you've been with for many years is normal. Or so he says. He also says it's normal to tell people we aren't together, or that we are together but not really serious. It's normal to never post pictures of us on social networking, to go to singles events. That's all normal.

Long story short, I have a LOT of $hit to work on. I think I am allowing myself to be abused. As someone here said in another post last night, (I am paraphrasing, so don't jump down my throat if the words are not exact) if you're going to hang with a rattlesnake, don't be surprised when you get bitten. He's a snake. Always poised to bite. And I am just sitting there, inches away, acting all f\*cking shocked when he strikes."

NarcissisticAbuse,fajpy41,t3_e9f4q3,1576150430.0,"I envy the place you are in because it's a place that forever seems out of my reach.

One of the things that therapy gave me was the understanding of what a ""normal"" romantic relationship should look like. Respect, kindness, honesty, forward momentum, trust, compromise. 

Despite my relationship having none of these, I stayed. Despite my therapist defining the behavior I was encountering as abusive, I stayed. And despite all of the evidence that things would never change, I stayed.

We would break up. For a day, a week, several weeks, etc. It didn't matter because the moment he contacted me offering me another chance, I went running back. 

And every time I went back, he offered me less than he had before. Less commitment, less time with me, just LESS. And of course it was my fault he was offering less. What did I expect? My behavior was unacceptable. I was clingy, untrusting, unstable, volatile. Forgetting somehow that I was all of those things because he was cheating on me, excluding me from everything, and subjecting to me to a recurring cycle of lovebombing followed by ghosting. Real ghosting -- as in no calls, texts or emails for days at a time, immediately after days of being sweet and loving and kind and patient. It was like I was stuck in a room with someone constantly hitting the light switch. Total brightness, total darkness, total brightness, total darkness. And I never knew exactly when the light was going to come on, how long it would stay on, and what I could do to keep it from getting shut off.  And every time he discarded me and took me back, he punished me for whatever I had done to bring on the discard. He took away everything we are supposed to receive from a partner until I was crawling the floor, searching for the tiny crumbs he was throwing in my direction. 

I was willing to endure the absolute worst kinds of abuse, if it meant he was still in my life.

So I envy the discard because it seems to be the only way I will ever permanently escape. I want him to not want me. I want him to hate me. I want him to find someone else. I want the cycle to end."

NarcissisticAbuse,fafyxff,t3_e8nt44,1576035451.0,"Read the first sentence of what you wrote. Your therapist told you that you were in an emotionally abusive relationship. Ignore any trolls that might be lurking in these parts, and realize that therapists usually know what they are talking about. Unless your therapist said that YOU were the abuser in the relationship, what you endured was very likely abuse. I didn't know I was in an abusive relationship until I saw a therapist, and even after I was told that it was abuse, I doubted it. I still believed there was something wrong with me. That's common. It's a result of the abuse. We believe something is wrong with US because the abuser says so. 

I am not a professional, but the evidence suggests that are not the ""sh!t"" one at all. Your therapist and other people in your life identified your relationship as abusive. You were the sole caretaker for an ailing parent, you put others first, and commented that if there is something wrong with you, you want to address it.  ""Sh!t"" people rarely take care of other people, unless there is something to gain. ""Sh!t"" people rarely put others first. And ""sh!t"" people certainly don't worry there is something wrong with them that needs fixing.

You were abused, and likely gaslighted into thinking you're the bad guy. You're not. Keep up with the therapy and focus on healing."

NarcissisticAbuse,f9szy9j,t3_e6r8ap,1575604776.0,"BTDT. So very many times.

Someone here helped me greatly with the following advice. It's borrowed advice, but some of the best I've been given. . . .   
Don't look at breaking NC as a failure. Think of the whole ordeal of leaving the narc as a lot like learning how to ride a bike. You try, you pedal a little bit, and then you fall off, and maybe skin your knee.  You get back on the bike, try again, and maybe pedal a little further. You go a little too fast, fall off again, and maybe you get REALLY bruised up so you're afraid to ever try again. That's when you have to get back on that bike and give it your best. And when you do, maybe it's the time you don't fall off, don't skin your knee, don't get hurt. You finally ride away.

I've learned to see each time that I went back as less of a failure and more of a life lesson. I learned that if I went back (fell of the bike) I was going to get hurt. But the answer wasn't to stay on the ground, crying. The answer wasn't to give up entirely just because I took a spill. No. Get back on the bike and keep trying until you get it right.

It's no different for us than for people who are trying to diet, and then they eat a bunch of donuts because they craved the sugar and couldn't resist. That's not a total failure. It's one slip. You keep going, not tank the diet completely.

You left, went back, and it turned out to be not so good for you. So leave again. And if you go back again, you just leave again.

I know everyone's experience is different. For me, it got easier to leave with each attempt, in part because I got used to being without him and found things to fill my time, and in part because I got stronger, smarter, and emotionally healthier.

So try again."
NarcissisticAbuse,f9fupyp,t1_f9fe5zd,1575286189.0,"Made it through another day.

The worst moment of every day is just after waking up, when it hits me that I am alone now.

I guess I was already alone, because what we had was not real. I was the only one in love, the only one investing my entire self into what we had. I was alone, but didn't know it.

That moment when I wake and I realize I will never be with him again, that is the hardest moment of the day. I seem to forget in my sleep that we are apart now, forever, and when I wake it dawns on me, slowly and painfully. He's gone. Even if he was never really there."

I blocked him EVERYWHERE. And so he created a new email address and reached out, asking me to unblock him.

Not responding to him has been torture. TORTURE.  

In fifteen minutes I will go exercise. After that, I will head to the office to immerse myself in work. After that I will clean, pay bills, organize my closet, and essentially try to remain constantly busy and moving until bedtime, at which point I will take something to help me sleep so that I am not up all night thinking about whether I should go back to him one last time, just to stop this pain.

I will gratefully accept the virtual hug, and read this post again and again today, every time I feel that pull, like gravity, towards a person who hurt me so badly I often wonder if healing will ever be possible."

No person has a right to treat you this way. He is breaking you, and you do not deserve to be broken.

I've been through the same. My hair thinned, my nails turned brittle and broke, my face was covered in bumps, my knees and elbows red and scaly.

You can deny what is happening to you, but your body will tell the tale.

Please leave. Make a plan, be strong, follow through. As difficult as it is to leave, there are countless stories here about surviving the withdrawal, staying NC, and eventually finding happiness at the end of the tunnel.

Good luck. I am rooting for you."
NarcissisticAbuse,f9ao3ro,t3_e4bb3e,1575204708.0,"He might have told people already. He might tell everyone tomorrow. He might never tell anyone.

If you committed a criminal act and you think that what he knows about you could prove you committed a criminal act, stop living in fear and get yourself a lawyer. 

If it's anything else, anything less than something that impacts your freedom, stop worrying. Completely. Even if he has proof, it doesn't matter. It DOES NOT matter. 

Imagine you were a prostitute. Now you're a politician. He knows you worked as a prostitute but no one else does and it will ruin your career. Unless he can actually prove it, which he probably cannot, you're worrying about nothing. Rumors rarely do the damage you think that they will. Rarely. It is an exception, not a rule, that a rumor will ruin you. Unless you really are a politician that was a prostitute. Then you can worry just a little.

I think the vast majority of people here have told their abuser immensely personal information that they regret sharing. As I mentioned above, unless it impacts your freedom, stop worrying. It's like worrying about the weather. It is out of your control, and even if you try to get a handle on the situation (like buying a shovel before it snows) you can't predict what time will bring. Maybe flurries, maybe a blizzard. You might be facing major clean up, or nothing at all. Good news is, rumors spread and die. And only some people will believe them. I'm sure you know the saying,""those who matter don't mind, and those who mind don't matter."" The people who know you and care about you WILL be there for you, and likely will not believe a word of what he says. If he opens his mouth, stick close to your loved ones, and wait for the storm to blow over.

And btw, if you really and truly cannot deal with the uncertainty, then get in front of it. If you speak first, YOU control the story, and you can spin things as you need to."

And most of those groups do have some one-on-one counseling, though usually on a temporary basis. There is a screening process, but they are amazing. Seriously. The level of support and encouragement offered is pretty mind blowing. Even if you don't love the idea of group therapy, it will help you stay NC and help you process what has happened to you."
NarcissisticAbuse,f965xj7,t3_e3zw7h,1575140194.0,"NO. You are not broken. You are not irrational, pathetic, ridiculous, stupid or crazy.

You just need space before you can see things clearly.

I've been called the same and worse. Like you, I believed it.

We can't be abused if we aren't torn down first. A strong person will not tolerate abuse. A strong person will say F\_CK YOU and walk away.

TO be able to abuse you, your disordered partner had to slowly eat away at your self-esteem, one day at a time, one remark at a time. The remarks got worse, the criticism more targeted, more personal. Before you knew it, this person was probably tearing you down on a regular basis, and what you once would never have believed about yourself became fact.

But it's not fact. You might need to go to therapy to truly grasp what has happened to you, but you didn't go from someone worth dating, worth being with for six years, to an irrational, pathetic, ridiculous, stupid person. If you were any or all of those things HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WITH YOU in the first place. He said those things to hurt you, to bring you down low and make you small, so that he could take all that he could from you. A weakened person has fewer standards, fewer boundaries. This person robbed you of those two things - standards and boundaries.

The longer you are away, the more you will realize what he did to you. And you'll slowly grow stronger, reestablish those standards and boundaries, and fortify yourself so that this doesn't happen to you again. 

But please stop tearing yourself down. He's done that enough already."
NarcissisticAbuse,f963v2m,t1_f9615by,1575139323.0,"I didn't either. I thought I was insecure, jealous and possessive.  I had never been any of those things in the past, and I hated myself for developing such unattractive traits during the relationship.  

As it turns out, a decent partner will not behave this way. Ask someone you know who is in a healthy relationship the last time they spoke that way to their husband/wife/partner.  An occasional remark is one thing.  But we as humans **instinctively know** not to go on at length about someone who could be a potential sexual partner. It will only make the current partner insecure. It's not rocket science."
NarcissisticAbuse,f960d7e,t1_f95qozb,1575137998.0,"Yes, and the more I read about it the more examples I can think of.

Like when he attended a work presentation and spent twenty minutes that evening telling me about the woman who presented. He lauded her brilliance, her educational background, her accomplishments in the industry.  And as he went on and on I silently asked, has he ever spent this much time praising another man? And I tried to stay silent but he would NOT stop. I started watching the clock after a while. Five minutes, ten minutes, still going, still going. Did I know that she was also well dressed? Put together? She must make a lot of money, right? So well spoken. So organized. SO meticulous. And then I finally opened my mouth. I didn't raise my voice, just very calmly stated that he clearly wanted to f-ck her because he made his point about how great she was eighteen minutes ago. It's not like he was telling me ABOUT THE PRESENTATION, or anything specific and worthwhile. Just going on and on about HER. Never once, before or since then, did he ever speak about a male colleague that way.

I've posted about this before . . . . I'll give the short version . . . . for months he talked endlessly about a coworker that was so hot that everyone wanted her.  Months went by, and suddenly the daily talks about the hottie stopped. Fast forward a year and she somehow came up in conversation and he admitted to wanting her, told me I didn't have to worry about her anymore because she no longer worked there.  My thought? I knew back then something was up when he brought her up constantly. But back then when I mentioned her he made me out to be paranoid, jealous, and insecure.  Turns out I was right. He wanted her. Seems she was smart enough to stay the f-ck away from his crazy, abusive a$$.

It has taken some real distance to see what I was dating all those years."
NarcissisticAbuse,f95ay9l,t3_e3qd84,1575123664.0,"What you're experiencing is the managing down of expectations. Your nex gave you less and less and less, and the more you allowed him to get away with it, the more it became the norm, and the more he was able to mistreat you.

If you looked at the relationship from the outside, as a purely neutral observer, you would immediately remark that this is NOT a relationship. This is abuse. This is mistreatment. This is abject cruelty. You cannot see it for what it is because this started somewhere else, somewhere closer to normal. He slowly withdrew everything normal, healthy and functioning about your relationship, and left you with something dysfunctional, one-sided, and toxic.

There are a lot of well-written articles on narcissism and managing down expectations. Start reading them so you can come to a better understanding of why you are tolerating this, and how it might appear to be normal or acceptable from the inside, whereas the rest of us here can look at this and tell you NO F-CKING WAY.

On the subject of leaving, try it for a day. Today. Go NC. Completely. Every time you get the urge to call him, see him, or text him, come back here. Post. if you don't feel like posting, read. If you don't feel like reading, go exercise. Meditate. Plant a flower. Sing a song. Take a 30-minute language course. Organize your entire closet. Still feel like calling or texting or seeing him? Just tell yourself one more minute. One more hour. One more day.

NC can feel overwhelming and isolating. You're not alone. There are lots of people here to communicate with, and everyone is already rooting for you. You CAN do this. 

The most amazing thing in the whole wide world is that while there are so many things in this life that you cannot choose, you CAN choose the very special human that you share your life with, that you willingly let into your home, that you willingly let into your body, that you willingly let into your bed. There is already so much in this world that you have no control over.  But the world, or whatever higher being you believe in, has given you the wonderful gift of choice when it comes to your partner in life. How great is that? You can choose a smart person, a worldly person, an athletic person. You can choose a gangster or a poet. A motorcycle enthusiast or a painter. You can choose someone who wants sex all the time or never, someone who praises you until you blush or someone who criticizes you until you cry. IT'S YOUR CHOICE. So make the right one."
