I won't tell you how to live your life, but what I will say is that the ultimate goal is to be fulfilled as an individual so that you don't need a lover to feel whole. I'm not saying it's easy, I'm not there and probably won't be for a couple years at least. But don't think your ex is perfect and you won't be happy without them. Prove them wrong for leaving by being happier than they are. Achieve your goals. You can message me on text or something if you need to work through shit"
