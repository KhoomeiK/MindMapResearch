I loved it whenever she said that, it was just a glorious experience having her admire all the excess then my moobs, with my hands, then gently lifting and dropping my two-tiered belly to let her take in all the movement created by all my belly blubber. All 5'8"" and 135 pounds of her was naked and I could see her massage her nipples, then reach down between her legs as my 5'9"" and 326 pounds jiggled towards her. 

""It looks like someone has eaten way too many Christmas treats. What a poor fat boy, looks like he has put on at least 75 pounds since meeting his feedress. Does the fat boy want to get even fatter for his feedress?"" 

""Yes he does,"" I said eagerly, awaiting the unparalleled taste of the chocolate eclairs, the bakery box positioned between her shapely long legs. ""Then join me,"" she said, and I laid beside her on the bed, as she proceeded to feed me eclair after eclair with one hand, while stroking my painfully erect cock with the other. I moaned with ecstacy, telling her that this was a most wonderful Christmas Eve present. 

She leaned over and kissed me, getting a mix of sticky chocolate and custard on her lips, which I obligingly licked off, then said ""this is but the beginning my fat lover, we're going to have so much fun at your parent's house tonight and tomorrow, showing them just how big a glutton their baby boy has become."" 

""Please don't embarrass me in front of my family,"" I begged. ""I wouldn't do anything of the sort,"" she said with an evil grin. ""Now, let's finish off these last half dozen eclairs and get you ready to go to your parent's.""

I hadn't been home since the previous April, so my folks and my siblings had no idea how fat I'd become. I got a lot of grief before when I was just 250 pounds or so, so imagine what it would be like walking in the door at over 325 and on the arm of an impossibly in-shape girlfriend. 

I took the turkey leg and coconut cake off her hands so she could open the Coke, then she held it up to my lips for a long sip, which she then replaced with a big wet kiss while she fondled my big man boobs. Once finished with the kiss, Lana excitedly said ""I've got to tell you now, you won't believe who I ran into in the kitchen raiding the leftovers!"" 

I took a big bite of turkey and said ""I dunno, Loreen?"" 

""No Fatty, it was Chip!"" 

""My brother Chip?"" 

""One and the same. He was doing the same thing as me, collecting food to bring back to his big fat lover. He grabbed the other turkey leg and the rest of the pumpkin pie to go back and stuff Loreen with. Turns out he was totally turned on by seeing her pig out with you at dinner and wanted to keep the good times rolling."" 

""I'll be damned,"" I said. 

""No, you'll be too fat for the Santa suit in the morning, so eat up Piggy Santa. Then I'll give you my special Christmas gift ..."" 

I got wide eyed and said ""you don't have tell me to eat"" and dug into the turkey leg and coconut cake with a gusto I'd never exhibited before. Lana looked on adoringly and murmured ""you're gonna get so fat for me, aren't you, 600 pounds by next Christmas shouldn't be any problem for my big fat Santa.""

As we lay in bed after I finished my wee hours snack, it occurred to me that"
schizoaffective,ev9344e,t3_ci22pd,1564303491.0,"Didn't read the article but wanted to say that vigilante type stalkers always come across to me as being delusional and completely and wholly unrealistic about the world, in a way far more significant and harmful than any of my actual schizophrenic delusions have ever been, but for some reason people like zealotry if it's for ""good reasons."" And that's how hate crimes happen."
schizoaffective,ev58ljs,t1_ev0evqi,1564229546.0,"I really appreciate getting to read this. I always feel so alone with having these thoughts and fears that I often in hindsight can only recognize as having been irrational. My last conspiracy involved what I can only summarize as ""lesbian police whores."" I had an entire conspiracy that a gang of lesbians was going around training women to be gay so they would make police reports (real or false) to get people's husband's and or their own boyfriends thrown in prison. In actuality, all I was picking up on was that everyone in my environment is a lesbian and they were bullying me. Who knows why, probably because I'm straight and not a feminist. I feel like an idiot writing that out. Lol. I also thought these people were trying to give me lupus or colorectal cancer because I wouldn't make any reports- real or false- at their command. I always hallucinate a conspiracy as a reaction to people not liking me apparently LOL."
schizoaffective,ev581u3,t1_ev1nyn1,1564229260.0,"I'm relieved to hear I'm not the only one with that specific anxiety, although I'm sorry to hear you have to deal with it too. I once read a statistic that could be wrong for all I know, but it was something like half of all accidental police shootings (as in, the police shot when they shouldn't have) happen to people with a disability."
DID,ev4wwk8,t3_cifx2c,1564223140.0,"A bunch of people thought I was gay because when I described my fantasies, they're just my fetish happening to me. Eg I'm just thinking about a mysterious personmanwoman tickling me or tricking me into gaining weight. Lol."
DID,ev00f39,t1_ev005i0,1564129692.0,"Hilariously, my brother tried to get me to talk about the...forbidden family arts with him recently (aka the reason why I have DID). I never did, I got over that shit and stay out of other people's business, but I definitely noticed him trying to act like a fucking enforcer or something and try to lure me into saying stupid shit like that I'm going to write a tell all book about the family secrets. That's gay and I'd never do that. My brother's family crest is basically 'snitches get stitches,' except even if you aren't a snitch he will still try to fuck you up. I decided to disown my brother after this incident, FYI. Who needs enemies when you have family. There's weird gossip that we still hang out and I don't know where it's coming from, I haven't seen him since...last November, I want to say?"
DID,ev005i0,t3_chjtei,1564129569.0,"Perfectly possible. My oldest sister has what appears to be borderline and AsPD with mild bipolar, my older sister has what appears to be OSDD mixed with schizotypal, my brother... Oh my lovely brother. Recently had a chat with him, like six months ago, and his response to me trying to rekindle a relationship...was him trying to tell other people I'm criminally insane. Not sure what he said but I went to a family thing to find out half the family thinks I'm trying to sleep with my cousin and is acting like I'm about to commit a school shooting. So no thanks on that, I think I just narrowly avoided my brother trying to pin something on me. My wonderful AsPD brother who pretended to have DID to get me to talk to him. Then there's me, a schizoid with PF DID and schizoaffective. I got fucked the hardest in my family, with my brother always being set up in the 'good position's relative to me, so our different diagnosed make sense. My younger sisters are both probably sociopaths, one with DID and the other without. It's pretty easy to see what a person's role was in their family by how their mental illnesses manifest differently. Sure, there are genetic differences and differences by chance, but often enough it leaves a pretty big sign as to who was placed in the position of alpha, etc in a family hierarchy. They often have less amnesia."
schizoaffective,euzxv1i,t3_ci01em,1564128405.0,"I've been having a, frankly crippling, delusion for the past year that I'm being set up for a police hit, that I'm about to take the fall either for someone else being a pedo or a serial killer, and the police are so dumb they'll see I have a mental illness diagnosis and they'll think I'm the perpetrator. So it's kind of like a weird paranoia about police hits crossed with my internal perception that the police are idiots."

DID,eufob7m,t3_cg8w7v,1563783318.0,"I have a weird relationship with my memory - even relative to other people with DID. My memory is so cut up into tiny pieces that I experience my memory as a bunch of fictional stories that my alters (who presumably remember something) share with each other as like, a metaphorical retelling of our life. Names, dates, and places are shuffled around. I'm pretty sure, just like one day out of the blue, my system was like 'I ain't no snitch' and then consciously dismantled and shuffled my memory so I could never possibly be a witness in a court case. I basically gave myself false memory syndrome. So I often have no idea what's going on in my life because my regular memory is just me bullshitting stories to myself and I kind of just have to trust the like five thousand alters that regularly front that they know what they're doing. Time loss in general is more of a gradient for us. It's like slowly slipping into unawareness and then out of it - like the motion of a wave."
AskDID,eud0zil,t3_cfw38v,1563695562.0,Switching is a constant fact of life. Everything is internal dialogue and communication. Emotions? A sense that I exist as a person? What are those things. I am so blown out of my mind with constant dissociation that feeling less depersonalized/realized is a special treat I get to enjoy like literally once a year for ten minutes.
schizoaffective,eubq6p0,t1_euaon7p,1563654256.0,"I love this. I thought I had the power to give people schizophrenia and went on a multi-month vengeance quest in my head as I lay in bed in a catatonic stupor. It was probably the most ironic thing that has ever happened to me. What didn't help is I noticed several of my (at the time, I don't talk to these people anymore - if you can't tell from the fact that my delusion was a vengeance quest, I didn't like these people at all to begin with and it came out in my delusions) friends actually do most likely have undiagnosed psychosis so it reinforced itself."
