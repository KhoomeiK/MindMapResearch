In the midst of a manac episode, a key distinction is we cannot SEE that what we are experiencing is FALSE. Granted, it starts off and we can see, ""Oh damn, shit is getting weird"" but once we can't tell the difference we need a medical intervention. This is important. Medical intervention. Get them help before they ruin their lives or someone else's. Don't try to be the doctor. You wouldn't try to cure someones cancer don't think you can fix a manac episode.

If he wants to fight for this relationship and you want to fight for this relationship, then you guys rock and I wish you the best kind of happiness.

If you decide to manipulate him, while he is vulnerable, into staying then you are the worst kind of person. I'm not accusing you of doing this but sadly this is what some people do. My first wife gas lighted me, and used guilt and my BP to control me."

What, is he supposed to stalk her until she loves him again? She left him if he pushes it then he is breaking the law, period. 

Also: Just because we have BP doesn't mean we are children. People don't need to decide if I want to be in a relationship. Bottom line. An adult broke up with him. He has no right, legal or otherwise to try to get her back when she left him. This is not some f-ed up TV romance. This is just a few bad decisions away from stalking. She is gone."

How has my life changed? I'm less arrogant. I am more understanding. I now know that my understanding of reality and perception was completely wrong. I learned that I am a couple of bad days away from losing everything. I learned not to trust myself. I learned to lie about my feeling and thoughts to others. **""I'm fine. Really, I'm just tired.""** 

I hurt mentally daily. My emotions are permanently amplified. Pain is my constant companion. I hold on for my family, but it's mostly misery. I am a constant disappointment to myself and others. It would be easier to eat a bullet but My Dad went out that way and I am not capable of doing that to my wife and kids.

***BUT*** I have been married and I have held down a job for 20 years. I have three kids and a dog. People call me high functioning, but that's like saying, ""You look fine.
