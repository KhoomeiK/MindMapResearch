2) The sound of birds singing in the morning.

3) The feel of a cool breeze when you are taking a walk.

Life can be hell. Just remember that when you feel down, good things feel even better.

Your body was made to live. Your brain is designed to keep yourself alive. That is why it feels hard to try killing yourself. When you die, you are incapable of improving yourself.

depression,epzf3b7,t3_bwq6lk,1559664407.0,"Dear sir,

The subject of medication of any kind is difficult for many reasons. You are a unique person with a unique body chemistry. Meds that work on me may not work as well for you. Before taking any medication, consider these thoughts.

1) How much do you need the medication? Some people react very negatively to certain medications. Is your depression such a problem that you are willing to risk the possibility of suicidal thoughts as a side affect?

2) Are you willing to be hospitalized? The best way to get your medication right is to enter into an inpatient program. This will allow for your medication to be changed more rapidly (in weeks) than by seeing a psychiatrist on an outpatient basis (months). This is not necessary, but I have found it to be helpful.

3) See if you can take a genetic test. I was just told that this was an option after over two years of treatment. A genetic test can help your psychiatrist narrow down the medication that is right for you. Some meds disagree with you on a genetic level.

4) Does crying help you relieve stress? Some antidepressants physically prevent your body from crying. Because of my meds, I can't cry.

I hope that this has helped you. Know that l am praying for you.

For me sleep is a place to just forget about my problems. I don't dream often, so sleeping is like a time machine. All I can say is that you (and I) need to find things in the real world that can take our minds off our problems. Whether it is writing or drawing, we need to be productive in any way possible. I hope that you can find an activity that you can put your whole being into.

Also, your dreams are created by your brain as a way of cataloging information. Any connection or love that you feel in them is not real. Even the smallest bit of love that you experience while awake is genuine. A single real positive experience is worth so much more than a week of dreaming. I hope that my love for you, a fellow human being with a unique mind and soul, is worth more than your dreams. Take what you can from your waking moments and treasure it.

First of all, I congratulate you on being able to fight your depression. I am still in the fight and based on my diagnosis I will be for the rest of my life. I too have a hard time remembering things. More accurately, I have no sense of time. Sometimes events that occurred years ago seem to have happened yesterday. Sometimes yesterday seems to have happened a while ago.

I have no definitive answers, but here are some ideas.

1) Read through your writing. Whether you have a journal or just have some old school essays, try to put yourself into the mindset you were in when you wrote them. This may bring back some memories.

2) Look at photos or videos of yourself or events you participated in.

3) Ask your parents or friends to tell you stories about you. Even stories about you when you were younger may help.

One of the worst things to go through is knowing what you need to do but not being able to do it. It sounds like you understand your situation.

2) People love you. Whether this sounds crazy or not, people around the world are praying for you even though they don't know you.

I am struggling with depression as well. I got to the point where I could not cry anymore. This was bad because I feel much better after I cry (due to the natural dopamine dump). After mentioning this to my therapist, I learned that the medicine that I was (am) on prevents the body from crying. It is annoying that the medicine that you need to feel happy can mess with you in other ways.

I always feel stupid trying to help others because I  am struggling myself, but I want you to know that despite what you (or I) think, things will get better. Life is full of ups and downs. People with depression just get to savor the ups more than other people.
