My first day back I walked 9,500 steps and i picked up my old eating habits. I wake up late so I usually don't eat before work, then after i might have one meal. 

Take it easy, things will go back to normal. I struggled when I gained weight, too. It felt good until I'd feel fat. I shed the weight pretty quickly after I stopped focusing on gaining (I had stopped eating for awhile and lost a lot of weight)."
