I’m sorry that people ghost you, that’s really cruel of them, and I hope that you don’t turn to sh as a way of coping, because it can destroy you. Trust me, it will rule your life and not in a good way. Have you ever considered a therapist? It sounds like you don’t really have anyone to talk to about your struggles. Maybe talking would help? I know it’s hard but ranting to someone, and having those deep conversations you talk about wanting is really helpful. Maybe reach out to that girl that was so nice. Anyways, I really wish you the best of luck❤️"

That’s a fucked up thing your mom told you, and I’m so sorry that had to happen. Even though your mom said that, I’m sure that if you had the thought that it would make her sad, then it definitely would make her sad. Mothers have a connection to their children that can’t be broken, and as false as it may seem, she does love you. 

Think about all the things keeping you alive. Those are the things you have to focus on. I believe you can live, and I believe that even if it takes years, things do get better. 

You are such a strong person to survive what you have and to survive the emotional pain you go through and your so brave. Please, don’t end your life. I wish you the best❤️"

If you really can’t resist it, I would say definetly do self harm that won’t leave scars, like punching or slapping or super shallow cuts. And if you do cut, don’t do your wrist. It’s the most dangerous and the most visible. 

Second of all, that’s a shitty thing you had to go through, and I’m really sorry that happened to you. Have you told anyone in real life about your struggles? I found that telling even just one person that’s close to you really helps you cope.
