DesperateHousewives,fpkv8fp,t3_gdxu9n,1588701618.0,Good point!! Like how did she figure out her mistake if she messed them up to begin with? The whole plot line was kind of stupid tbh. I just didn’t like it
agt,fpbj4oc,t3_g93rlz,1588471203.0,Frankly I’m glad. There’s not much to do since we’re in quarantine and this will give us something to watch/do. Also it’s nice to have some normalcy back

So it’s weird that she’s calling Lynette Mom and acting part of the family and then all of the sudden turns into a complete psycho and is so against Lynette"
DesperateHousewives,fnpcrd7,t1_fnpci4g,1587143222.0,She didn’t get along with the show’s creator

I know characters are often killed off because their actors/actresses can not be on the show anymore, for any reason (like Edie), but DH was about to end! If the actor needed to leave couldn’t he just do a few more episodes? And he does make a few post death appearances too like the flashbacks and the last episode on the driveway"

DesperateHousewives,fmld2yz,t3_fvt2ou,1586183972.0,"I completely agree about Mike dying and Gabby’s daughter. I don’t know why they made Mike die, especially so late into the show. I know a lot of times characters are killed off because the actor/actress doesn’t want to do any more episodes, but the show was almost over! They couldn’t just have him stick around for the end? I also thought Julie having a baby with Porter was stupid."
