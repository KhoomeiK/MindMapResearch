BPD,fistx06,t3_f9ch7m,1582693243.0,"This happens to me daily. I work as a cafeteria cook/server and an elective art teacher. 

1- kids are loud in the cafeteria. I’ve begun to get used to loud noises and not letting them bother me. But at a certain point of loudness I can’t discern voices anymore so I’ve gotten very good at reading lips. 

2- I always tell my students in my class early on that I can’t function in loud spaces because of bpd/anxiety (they react instantly if they see me cringing or covering my ears).  This has helped a lot in my classroom management. 

3- the one thing that gets me on a daily basis is the bathroom in the cafeteria kitchen. The toilet screeches. You know that sound? Of plumbing not working exactly right. The whine. Well, in a room that I can’t fully outstretch my arms in any direction, it is terrible. I rush to flush, wash and dry my hands before basically running out to the room.

TooAfraidToAsk,fiso7d6,t3_f99yvv,1582689013.0,"I’ve done some meditation practices for this. Bear with me while I try to explain: 

First question. Who are you? You want to describe yourself with things and titles. As everyone does. But without those. What are you? How would you describe yourself? Keep this in mind. 

Begin by meditating on the things that you own. My car. My house. Etc. and drop them away. They are possessions that do not matter. Then go deeper. Non physical possessions such as titles. Motherhood. Teacher. Accountant. Etc. the next is harder. Physical things that are not “you”. Your hands. Your body. Etc. you begin to realize that even the things that are physical about you are belongings to your inner self. So what happens when you get rid of all of those things? That’s the question. 

It can be hard to do and may take a while and many sessions to get to the end point. For me it was a way to confront the never ending abyss that I was so afraid of. I hope this helps and even if it is not something you use I hope that any of it can help open some more thought to it. I wish you all the best."

I was staying the night at his place. We had only been tot her a couple months so this was a big deal. We had fun and had a few drinks and I watched him make a painting. We did the deed, cuddled up naked, and went to sleep. I was having very strange dreams about drinking paint. My stomach felt weird in the dream and I kept waking up sweating and feeling like I had actually drank paint. However, I attested this nausea to the fact that I thought I had consumed paint in my dreams. I continued to come In and out of this dream state until I bolted up wide awake suddenly aware that I needed to vomit. I scrambled over the bed and was relieved to feel that I could make it to the bathroom in time. Only, the door to the bedroom was shut. I the velocity of myself launching from bed made the stop at the door a little vicious. I managed to stop the velocity of my body, but not my stomach. 

You know that thing you do when trying not to throw up? The putting your hand over your mouth thing? Well my insides would not be held back by a few fingers and I fountain sprayed the wall, door and myself. At this point bf is awake and tells me to head to the bathroom. I rushed to the bathroom and sat on the floor crying in absolute horror of what had happened. Bf comes in to check on me and tells me he had cleaned all of it up and proceeded to run me a shower. I felt so bad. After my shower he tucked me back into bed and brought me some water. 

This is the number one most humiliating moment of my life. And he just took it all in stride without as much as mentioning it until a long time later. Almost three years later and we can laugh about it. I already knew he was a keeper but this solidified that feeling."

I have tendencies to try to pin hate on a sign, but when I do it always backfires because I’ll meet someone with that sign and be like, “well shit they’re super cool and are nothing like this other person”.

tarot,fi462xo,t1_fi45ylg,1582134706.0,That’s a good plan too. Isn’t there a witchy one with all females that is based off of it?
tarot,fi460cv,t1_fi45vge,1582134666.0,Thank you! That’s what I’ve been trying to do (following my intuition) and it’s like this deck is fighting back! Not to mention the dismal and doom answers it gives me for everything.
tarot,fi45r9e,t1_fi45lk5,1582134524.0,I’ve looked at the Waite deck too. I was just not totally sold on the art style. But it could be a good starting point. I mean I can always get other decks lol

Sounds legit 😂"
witchcraft,fhrpjb6,t3_f4khlm,1581833575.0,"So weird story. I have felt this way about the wind and air since I was younger. Like maybe about 10? A real connection and energy on a breezy day. It makes me feel alive. Wind invigorates me. I would get excited and tell it to blow and gust, but I pushed too far. 

One night (at 12yo) I was laying in bed listening to the wind and just couldn’t go to sleep. Tossing and turning until I finally went downstairs to the couch. Note that I hated sleeping anywhere except my own bed, to the point that I could can’t stay the night at a friend’s or usually even sleep in the living room. The wind was picking up pretty good at this point and in my mind I told it to blow harder. Basically demanded. I thought I had complete power and control over the intense wind. 

Shocker: I did not. 

I fell asleep listening to the wind chimes in complete bliss on the couch. In the middle of the night I woke up to a sound like a distant drum. Only it wasn’t a drum it was trees falling. Over the next couple hours, sixteen trees fell on our property of two acres; one of which landed on our house and made the ceiling fall in on my bed. Right where I would have been sleeping. Another hit every car in our drive way. It was a massive freak storm for the area that had never happened before or since. 

Now ifI feel the need to ask the wind for help, I ask nicely. But I do not bother her much anymore. She is her own beast, not to be tamed. As for that night I thank my intuition for leading me away from danger. 

I am new to the practice, but my experience tells me to be respectful and cautious. I do wish you all the best luck and let me know if anything works for you! I would be excited to learn more as well!"
BPD,fhq7s9h,t1_fhps51u,1581800466.0,I love adventure time! Some of the later seasons get a little intense. But if I’m sad I rewatch the first couple seasons
BPD,fhq7ebg,t1_fhpm8sy,1581800315.0,I second this. It’s one of the things I watch to feel good!
CatsAreAssholes,fhobjtp,t3_f3zls7,1581748751.0,I had to do this with a litter of kittens that were born I’m my grandparents’ attic.
tifu,fhlrio8,t1_fhjhwni,1581703746.0,"My big fuck up came about three months in. I was staying the night and in the middle of the night I was having fever dreams that I didn’t realize were such. I finally fully woke up and my stomach was doing some Olympic grade flips in my abdomen. I launched off the bed, scrambling for the bathroom. But the bedroom door was closed. The sudden stop at the door didn’t stop the inertia of my stomach and I threw up all over the door, the wall and myself. I ran to the bathroom and had an anxiety attack. He came in to check on me and ran me a shower telling me he had already cleaned it all up. That was over two years ago. We still joke about it to this day."
BPD,fhg6qv7,t3_f2t6od,1581559869.0,"I have done this. Mainly when I don’t get responses to my very needy messages. I’ve gotten better and instead of giving into this “need”, I try to do something for myself. Because they can’t make me happy. Only I can do that. So I run a bath or make myself some yummy food. Right now I am making myself a blanket (I crochet and only ever make things for others and not for myself, so I decided to do something for me)."
tifu,fhg48wc,t3_f2tacq,1581558238.0,"It sounds to me that he was definitely asking for it. Im in karate and have taken self defense classes for women. What you did is basically exactly what we were taught. Verbally tell him to leave you alone. If you can tell he is a threat and he is not listening to you and still advancing, that is his attack on you. You had every right to do what you did. Make sure you are very clear when you have to recount what happened that you gave him warnings and when he wouldn’t listen that you feared for your safety. Hold your head high and believe in yourself!"
BPD,fhde0fo,t3_f2i2n3,1581483568.0,I recently found out I am borderline and have since theorized that my best friend is also borderline. She didn’t abuse me per-say but she is one to absolutely ghost people and is very much a splitter. Someone does one thing that can be seen as upsetting and they are suddenly satan incarnate. I wish I was still close with her and could talk with her again about my diagnosis.
