BPDmemes,fckx6sc,t1_fcj14h7,1577735115.0,That’s because antisocial stands for antisocial personality disorder; which is characterized by a disregard for others and law breaking. It means more anti society.
BPD,fch3146,t1_fch2qc4,1577646828.0,"sometimes i go through phases where i feel like i’m perfect. i look perfect, i’m better than everyone else, i have a sense of superiority and have great social skills and believe i can do anything. 

then i hate myself. i’m ugly, stupid, nobody likes me. i hate everyone, i cant do anything right. everyone is better than me."
BPD,fch2ee2,t3_eh9q8n,1577646646.0,yes it happens often for me
BPD,eysoz2d,t1_eysow1s,1567406614.0,"Omg me too, I’ve thought about faking my own death and just moving on from my past because I hate it so much and my old self(s)."
BPDmemes,ey7uk3t,t3_cvsg3g,1566901274.0,OH MY GODDDD I’ve never related to something so hard
BPD,eszcw6q,t1_esyxzl6,1562359574.0,"Same here. I don’t externally release anger or express my splitting, and a lot of doctors think you have to be stereotypical fatal attraction to have BPD but it is so. Not. True."
BPD,esvvhq5,t3_c9bqpm,1562304789.0,"Doesn’t really sound like you have any to be honest. Maybe some conduct issues in childhood but you seem normal to me. Kids do stupid shit all the time, too. Not saying it was OK but you recognize it was wrong now and seem to have grown out of it."
BPD,esv9ksv,t3_c9andn,1562295769.0,I am so sorry. My heart breaks for you. I’m so seriously sorry. Please take care of yourself. All of us are here for you.
sex,esrsfk3,t1_esrscab,1562235239.0,Can it break from fingering myself? How much will it hurt?
sex,esrryc8,t1_esrq579,1562234785.0,"I’m not sure, how can I know?"
BPD,esr6ntw,t1_esr3wtn,1562217795.0,Thank you. My favourite song by all time low.
BPD,esqkzrd,t1_esnrj6y,1562204601.0,"All the symptoms of BPD, but instead of exerting your feelings outwards you tend to be quiet about them. All anger and emotions will be more internalized and less likely for other people to notice. Most people with quiet bpd never get diagnosed because they won’t be as “stereotypical”. Splitting and idealization won’t be as vocal. So not outwardly saying I hate you etc when you split."
BPD,esqd020,t3_c8vuyw,1562200065.0,Yup. I was literally thinking about this today. Sometimes I feel like a sociopath who feels nothing and has good social skills who lacks empathy and other times I’m an overly emotional empathetic hopeless romantic. It’s like a two personalities.
BPD,esq6oj6,t3_c8o3c6,1562196575.0,YES I daydream about these situations all the time.
BPD,ervrqnz,t1_ervq7ce,1561323400.0,"It is okay, the first step is realizing you have a problem. Do not fear. I’m assuming you aren’t diagnosed yet? Are you in any therapy or have a doctor to talk to?"
BPD,ervo13o,t1_ervnuu0,1561320746.0,"Splitting is when you go from idealizing someone (thinking they are the best, a perfect person) to devaluing them (thinking they are evil, hating them).

It’s basically the whole, I love you now I hate you thing. Very intense feelings."
BPD,ervm58m,t1_erv1tc9,1561319364.0,"Favourite person, someone you idealize and is your number one person you love the most in your life basically. Like a best friend but more intense."
BPDlovedones,ervjinl,t3_c3xxpm,1561317425.0,"Holy shit, please leave that relationship now, never physically abuse anyone. Please."
BPD,ert9oe3,t3_c3ryv4,1561236306.0,"Yup, thought I was the only one."
BPD,ert3x3j,t3_c3q70n,1561231765.0,YES!!!!!!!! I thought I was the only one. I get too scared
BPD,ert3mgb,t3_c3szqw,1561231534.0,"He is manipulating you and trying to make you feel guilty for accusing him. Gosh I am not sure what you could do I am sorry he isn’t being truthful.

The best bet is to hide the pills somewhere and if they stop disappearing well now you know."
BPD,ert2hz8,t3_c3q71o,1561230647.0,All the time I barely ever start conversations
BPD,ergl4rv,t1_ergkz1w,1560844785.0,Thanks so much. I’m sorry to hear you understand what I mean because it sucks. But the happiness is so nice.
BPD,er9u3e0,t3_c1014j,1560629919.0,"Just because they fear abandonment doesn’t mean they aren’t intuitive. That’s a very extreme statement. I’ve noticed many people here are much more emotionally intuitive than other people, especially my friend with BPD. They can tell when I’m upset even when other people don’t. They can easily pick up on other emotions."
limerence,eqtqb04,t3_bzltxw,1560317039.0,On my own by three days grace
BPD,eqt3b6s,t1_eqstnvl,1560301001.0,"Agreed, couldn’t have said it better. I’d be so uncomfortable knowing one of my friends would go to reddit talking about me and psycho analyzing me."
