MensLib,fc5z8h4,t3_eg9xh9,1577468901.0,"I've realized that the core of a lot of my issues is that I've never felt like my parents were emotionally invested in me. I can see how it's generational, looking at my grandparents and the relationship my parents have with them. There's a subtle hardness in the interactions, and the extremes seem to be either a distant disposition or too controlling. It's a bit relieving as well as sad that I've realized that whether or not my parents had not divorced, there are certain issues that I'd have to face just because of who they are. In one sense I'm glad because it's erased some ideas about my own fault or culpability for certain things, allowing me to realize that they would have happened anyway, but it's still sad to know that some issues I'll have to continue to deal with throughout my life with no fault of my own. I'm commited to taking the responsibility for my own self improvement, but I feel like I've already fought so hard just to survive until now as a (relatively) self adjusted individual, and now I'm facing the realization that it's just the tip of the iceburg. I just turned 22, but I already feel so tired. I feel hurt. The holidays tend to bring out these feelings. I'll just have to take things one day at a time, I guess."

Suffice to say, it's one of my favourite albums . Shit like December 24 and The Mint still shows what a monster Earl is at rapping even if he switched up stylistically. It made it easier to accept Feet of Clay and now I've discovered lot of good music through Earl. Wap Konn Joj! Is damn good."

It's going be difficult, but I think you're going to have to tell him what happened, and then let him clear up the story with his family if you don't want to have to repeat telling that story again. Or you could allow him to read the journal and clear up any misconceptions or misunderstandings when he's done. Listen. You are lovable, you are worthy, you are valuable, you are deserving of happiness. You have someone wonderful by your side who cares for you and loves you and is willing to support you. His actions have shown that he's on your side in this. It's going to be difficult, but I think it's necessary for you to allow him to be there for you, and that might involve taking the first step of being honest about what happened. You said you didn't want him to view you any differently, but he's already shown he values you, now you have an opportunity so that you won't have to bear this burden alone again. Trust in your partnership. You are strong, you can do it."

literature,ezxoavf,t3_d2sa0w,1568245446.0,"I finished Hard Boiled Wonderland and the Death of the World by Haruki Murakami. Honestly, i just like picking apart the technical aspects and comparing it to his other works, looking for the typical motifs etc. I like it because I think it's one of his readable novels.

Whenever I've been low recently I've revisited the ending of Jose Saramago's Death with Interruptions. I just find it's so potent the way he uses Death as a device for critiquing aspects of society, from governmnet and business to our individual conceptions of Death. I'm a sucker for anything with a romantic slant, so that kept pulling me back. The writing reminds me a bit of Gabriel Garc√≠a Marquez in a good way and I've been comparing their works in the back of my mind in regard to magical realism etc."

I'm reserved and a rather internal person. My girlfriend was expressive and found beauty in the most simple things that I was apathetic towards. You know what I did? I learned to show her that I cared. I had to learn to compromise and become better at meeting my gf's needs. Likewise, she had to learn to respect my apathy toward certain things. It didn't work out in the end for other reasons, but the relationship taught me a lot. He has to meet you halfway, and as of now it's looking very one sided."

conservatives,etgc09a,t3_cbg5vk,1562787820.0,"I think one of the tragedies of this entire debate is that both sides take the most extreme points of view as representative of liberals/conservatives as a whole.

Most reasonable people accept that there's a personal responsibility for weight loss, but the reality isn't as simple as 'just lose weight"" when there are genetic factors to consider, or perhaps time isnt a luxury if you're working 60 hrs a week, or a largely sedentary job. What about kids with parents raising them on junk? For a large part of their life they don't have much say on their diet which contributes to weight.

Is it a victim's fault for getting pregnant after being raped? Or what if teenagers took the necessary precautions but the contraceptives were defective. Or what about if you live in some backwater without quality education and a culture of promiscuity. Is it as simple as 'it's your fault,' or are you to some extent a product of your emvironment? Wouldnt the likelihood of pregnancy and STD's increase in those situations?

The reality is that there are too many situations in life that are out of people's control, or that for one reason or the other, people have limited or inhibited control, for the prevailing 'just get up and do it' mentality to be practical.

And any reasonable person doesn't hold the descendents of bad people responsible for the things their ancestors did, but it's important to recognize how the status quo has been built off  of past wrongs and the disenframchisement of many, and it's important for everyone, especially the descendents of those involved, to play a hand in levelling the playing field.

The issues people face are too complex and multifaceted to be dealt with by what we'd call a 'liberal' or 'conservative' approach, and that's what we're being distracted by."
