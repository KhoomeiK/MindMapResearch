AskReddit,fcbjvzq,t3_eh08om,1577587721.0,"it took me a few years of trial and error, but eventually i found my best recipe:

i wear a sleep mask because any speck of light prevents me from falling asleep.

also, blackout curtains are a life-saver and i cover up any small lights on things like charging technology with clothes or stickers or whatever i can use to block it from sight.

i always have at least 1 fan blowing in my room. not directly at my face, but either at my feet/body if it is hot outside or just somewhere in the room if the temp is comfortable. the fan doubles as a sound machine with white noise and cools the room down, too...because...

i have to sleep in a cool environment. whether it means using lighter sheets, a fan, turning down the heater/up the a/c or opening the window. if i am hot, i am uncomfortable and get more flustered and more hot and never get to sleep.

i listen to either sleep meditations or asmr videos as i fall asleep. i just play them on my phone by my bed and turn the phone over to prevent the light from bothering me. my favorite channels on youtube are meditation vacation and michelle's sanctuary.

i find i sleep better if i stop eating a few hours (at the least) before bedtime. i get bloated really easily and struggle with ibs so if i lay down uncomfortable i will remain uncomfortable and never fall asleep.

i also have found i sleep better if i get fresh air and am active during the day. i usually just go for a long walk with my dog and this checks both boxes.

i am a highly sensitive person so having comfortable and soft and loose-fitted pj's are essential. i will literally spend hours shifting in my bed trying to get my sheets and jammies perfectly aligned so as to not bother me with uncomfortable folds or constricting tight areas.

the body likes consistency when it comes to sleep, so if you are able to get on a regular sleep/wake schedule it will help you. when you get your body regulated to getting a solid X hours every night, you will have an easier time still getting adequate sleep even if these hours/times of sleep/wake are changed. (aka changing up the schedule won't hurt you once you maintain a healthy sleep schedule for some time)

hope this helps!"
