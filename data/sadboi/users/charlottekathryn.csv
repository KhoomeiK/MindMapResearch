Although fear of abandonment is a huge part if BPD, there is a criteria for a diagnosis. You must have 5 or more of the following traits:

- Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment.

- A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterised by alternating between extreme of realization and devaluation.

- Identity disturbance.

- Impulsivity in at least 2 areas that are potentially self damaging (including unsafe sex, drugs, driving recklessly, binge eating or starving.)

- Recurrent suicidal behaviour, gestures or threats, or self mutilating behaviour.

- Affective instability due to marked reactivity of mood (mood swings).

- Chronic feelings of emptiness.

- Inappropriate  intense anger or difficult controlling anger.

- Thransient stress related paranoid ideation or sever dissociative symptoms.


If you do have more than 5 of these traits, I would advise seeing a specialist. I wouldn't recommend a diagnosis of BPD, just go into detail about the symptoms and emphasis on the above. Some professionals are also weary about diagnosing BPD without a previous trauma, so do talk about any possible trauma that has happened.


I'm not sure how it is where you live, but in the UK, doctors are unable to diagnose you with mental health conditions. You would be referred to a psych consultant in order to get a proper diagnosis.

I hope this helps x"
