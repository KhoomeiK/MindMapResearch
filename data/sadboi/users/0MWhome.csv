I‚Äôm kind‚Äôve like that right now but I‚Äôm tapering off the meds bit by bit. 

This can be a deep question but how did you change your relationship with your voices? I‚Äôve heard about this on two different accounts, and now I‚Äôm just wondering how it‚Äôs done ü§î


The calm part of yourself sounds like a pleasant companion. Tactile, oh no! I‚Äôm very glad that you found coping mechanisms. You‚Äôre a strong person. 

When I get out of the medication haze and I get my life back a bit (where I feel like doing stuff) I‚Äôm gunna start doing Headspace (this amazing mediation app) every morning. I think mindfulness of the present moment can be a saviour from the destructive things that can be going on within your thoughts and feelings. Nature is important. That‚Äôs a good saying. 

Ymmv definitely. Every journey is different. I‚Äôll be sure to keep you posted when things start picking up. It‚Äôll be a little while till then in the small scale but in the big scale it‚Äôs right around the corner!"
