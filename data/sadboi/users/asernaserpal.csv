NPD,fp9xpwj,t1_fp9jihg,1588436725.0,Yeah I hope so too! My therapist always tells me the answer comes from exploring my own thoughts and feelings ;) but I think the book might resonate with you in terms of the role you maybe took on from a young age.
NPD,fp9bbmy,t1_fp8yp6k,1588421175.0,That‚Äôs interesting. Maybe check out the book ‚Äúthe drama of the gifted child‚Äù

One time during a really hard period of abandonment triggers I listened to one song every night over and over again‚Äî it was a comforting song from my childhood, the Bambi theme song LOL‚Äî and I just cried and hugged myself and held ice and showered and tried to teach myself that there is love within me, over and over and over again."
BPD,fofsbhl,t3_g78s78,1587741948.0,Thank you for voicing this!!! It needs to be heard more and more. It‚Äôs all part of a system that identifies people who suffer from systems of power as diseased and people who enforce systems of power as ideal and healthy. We are all conditioned to believe it to different degrees and it‚Äôs not fair. That‚Äôs my opinion at least!!
NPD,fofrugd,t3_g72e67,1587741708.0,"It‚Äôs so hard to make mistakes and have regrets and yet we all do it. Maybe you can define yourself by how you respond to your mistakes and regrets, in the present time, rather than by an impossible standard of moral perfection."
NPD,fnp6g9s,t3_g2wlf4,1587140040.0,"I also have a mix of cluster B traits and have been in psychodynamic therapy for a while, which has helped me understand how my previous experiences impact how i think about myself and others today. I've found it really helpful to talk to my dad about specific experiences like why did this happen and this is how I felt. I try not to come from a blaming place but more like to try and understand and feel understood. He is obviously stable enough to handle this kind of discussion and not everyone would be. But even people who are not as steady have been able to engage in discussion with me if its really not blame. Just like did you know that when i was a kid I was hiding all my ""negative"" emotions? how did you not know? it was rly painful for me. etc."

But recently I‚Äôve been trying to not do this, like to just be myself and not be their ideal girl from the beginning... then I end up waving my questionable flags right in front in the beginning with hopes that they won‚Äôt be deluded and will love the REAL me.

BPD,fmoz2tv,t1_fmoy3k2,1586271306.0,Do you think you could open up a little more to any of them? Or to anyone older and wiser who is in a position to be a personal support? It‚Äôs vulnerable but maybe if there‚Äôs a way to test the waters that could show you if it‚Äôs safe. I just think it‚Äôs really hard to stabilize that stuff. It‚Äôs sort of like a need for social reality testing.
BPD,fmoxycu,t3_fwiuo4,1586270696.0,The goddamn meaning WHY can‚Äôt I be one of these people who doesn‚Äôt have to think about self soothing??

Sometimes that can set an upward spiral going for me if I‚Äôm totally isolating. That and god damn self soothing skills like deep breathing and soft textures while you‚Äôre interacting w someone.

BPD,fmowt4m,t1_fmownz5,1586270037.0,He ended up with severely worsening mental health. I didn‚Äôt want him to be happy when we broke up bc I was so mad... but now I wish I hadn‚Äôt contributed to his unhappiness in that way
BPD,fmowllx,t3_fwkzmd,1586269915.0,Ugh that‚Äôs so tough!! It is such a painful feeling to be alone with your heartbreak when outwardly it seems like they aren‚Äôt feeling the sadness/anger anymore. Even though looks could be deceiving. I tried to control a precious ex into not dating anyone after we broke up.. it worked but I ended up seriously regretting that for what it‚Äôs worth...
BPD,fmgckw4,t1_fmfz0i2,1586046026.0,"That‚Äôs interesting and good you‚Äôre aware I think. Sounds like you‚Äôve got to reflect on your own feelings and emotions... maybe meditation or journaling, whatever works for you! And then figure out if you‚Äôre projecting your feelings onto her. Like thinking she‚Äôs super sad and lonely whereas you might feel a little sad and lonely too. I know that‚Äôs not very specific but I think it‚Äôs such a personal process..."
BPD,fmfwk48,t3_fv10qm,1586036342.0,"I think the most respectful thing is to be vulnerable, and to share your dilemma and your ambivalence. Treat her like a person, not someone who won‚Äôt be able to handle it, and also let her know you‚Äôre worried."
BPD,flbtl6m,t3_fnvw6x,1585012304.0,"I found it super helpful at first in the same way (like it held my brain together a little more tightly) and then I felt like it was interfering with my sleep and thus kind of messing with me during the day.

When I‚Äôve been at my best though has been when I LOVE my sensitivity and treat it like a superpower. That hasn‚Äôt always been possible (like if my work or relationship environment is too threatening), but I really believe it is a gift that just needs to be tended to and allowed the right space and care that will let it flourish. You know SO much without words and that is incredible."

BPD,fjpebke,t3_feg86x,1583548589.0,"This used to be soo hard for me and some things that helped were talking with my therapist about it, and also trying REALLY HARD to commit to memory moments when a friend or partner would say, ‚ÄúI was thinking of you today when...‚Äù especially when it was a moment they didn‚Äôt reach out to me. I tried to picture them doing their business at work or whatever and then thinking of me fondly and then going back to work. It was really scary somehow but super helpful. It also helped to notice whenever I was thinking of someone else and didn‚Äôt reach out. Very purposeful committing to memory, as if I‚Äôm trying to etch it into mental stone."

dbtselfhelp,fipi7sm,t1_fipefen,1582607721.0,Oh yeah I see that.
