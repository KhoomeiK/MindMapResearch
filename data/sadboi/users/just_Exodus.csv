The issue of the heavy demand and the sudden disappearance was oversaturation. You had people telling you that computers are going to be the only thing that will be around later and it's a ""wonder Field"" but then all of the positions got filled because not many people need a graphic designer.

 The other issue that I'm not bringing up is that college is freaking expensive! So if you don't have money from the start, it's hard to put in the effort when you just can't actually afford to. I mean one of the best things you can do is become an engineer, but that's an 8 year degree. Not to mention the school you go to can really effect your pay. So just because you go to school and make it through, doesn't mean you'll have half the chance as fancy pants daddy's money kid who didn't even have to pay anything for their degree. Meanwhile you're drowning in student loan debt that the interest keeps climbing on because you cant pay it AND survive fast enough.
