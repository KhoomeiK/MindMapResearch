But I can imagine that since they did the breaking, you’re better off without them. Trust me, I know how hard breakups can be. Whether it’s a partner, a friend, or a family member. But with you doing this ritual, shows that you’re starting to let yourself move on. And again, it’s telling you, that you’ll get better. :)"

depression,fbrlb7j,t3_ee58qm,1577043858.0,"I’m so sorry you had to overhear that, and that she’s not understanding at all. A little over a year ago I moved 2,000 miles away from my whole family. This year they decided to disown me, for my mental health, and because I’m gay. But a few of them specifically said it was due to my mental health. That’s not family. Just because you are related my blood, does not make you family. You get to choose your family, choose the people who want to help you, who love you unconditionally, and understand and accept the things you feel. I saw that you’re unable to move out right now. But I believe it you. It took me until I was 20 to finally move out. And until 23 to move across the country. For now I suggest trying to limit your communication with her, as well as your ability to hear what she says while on the phone, or talking to people who may be there. Maybe wear headphones and listen to books/music/podcasts. Or just blast your radio if you have one. 

It’s hard, I know that. But you’ll eventually get through it. Depression is rough, especially when your own family isn’t there to support you. But you have a whole “family” here. And if you’d like to message me privately if you ever need to chat or vent, please do! <3"

I’m thinking that maybe she didn’t realize it went to voicemail. But she keeps going. It was that good of singing, though I’m not one to judge that. She sounded like she may have been between tipsy and drunk. And my caller ID says she’s calling from one of our clients. After two minutes of this singing (which woke me up, but was super freaking hilarious) she ends the song (it was “at last”) and says “thank you, have a wonderful day”. Then as she was who to hang up I hear a soft whisper of her saying “damn, that was good.”  

Cracked me up! And you can bet your sweet butt that I’m gonna have a good day now!

My mom came over to the other side. This was all happening in the middle of the closing hymn. So my dad walks up to the stand, to tell the bishop. Who then just says “ok, I’ll let the person giving the prayer to make it short.”  It was NOT short. So after that, we got everyone out as fast as we could. I was freaking out that nobody had called 911. And then I was forced to go to class. Like yo, my grandma literally almost died on me. Umm, can I just go home? Lol! She ended up being just fine.

But when I was in high school my math teacher calmly looks at one of the students and says “can you go please get one of the office staff, my throat is closing up and I cannot breathe.” And so of course the student runs to the office. All the while my teacher is standing there still teaching us math, inbetween gasps of air! The principal comes in and says “why are you here still? GO!” So he grabs his stuff and walks away. And the principal taught the rest of class. My teacher was gone for the rest of that week. But none of us knew what even happened, or if he was ok. 

The next week he came back, and told us he drove himself to the ER (literally a 5 min drive from the school, but still!) and said as soon as he pulled up and got into the ER, his throat closed completely up. He had an emergency surgery, and had to have one of those balloon things put into his throat to open it up. To this day nobody, not even my teacher, knows why that happened to him. Wasn’t an allergic reaction. Wasn’t an existing illness. His throat just simply closed up. 

I could hardly function in class for the rest of the year cause I was terrified it’d happen again, but that he’d die right in front of us. It did happen again, but while he was on a weekend trip with friends. And he was back to school that Monday.

(Luckily I’m now 2000 miles from them) but when I was diagnosed nobody would even try. Only on my birthday did they try. But I swear all my family eats is pasta based foods, bread based foods, wheat based soups. Like can’t we just buy me a gf microwave meal at least? Like I don’t care! I always brought me own food too. Or they’d be like, Wells there’s a salad you can eat! 1. I’m so sick of salad 2. There’s croutons in it... then they’d say, oh just take it out. Like no, y’all don’t understand, I will be sick for dayyys if I do that. 

Then my dad decided to go gf too. Thinking he probably had it, as he had all the symptoms I had, the fact it’s genetic, and he has MS which is one of the long term effects. So he’d make him and I something. And it was always so much better than what everyone else ate. 

Also my, probably 125lb dad, has finally been gaining weight. He used to eat SO much because he was so skinny, and just couldn’t keep the weight on. He would even eat a bunch of fatty foods. Now he’s not only eating healthier foods, their gf, and he’s getting healthy. He did go have a colonoscopy, they say he doesn’t have celiacs. But the test was taken like over a year of him being gluten free. Soooo (I’m not dr so please correct me if I’m wrong) wouldn’t that mean that his colon now looks like what it’s supposed to? They did tell him he has a reallyyyyyy bad gluten intolerance. And even if he licks something with gluten he gets sick. It honestly sounds like CD to me... 

But I’d say, make a whole other meal one time, bring it over, and prove to them that not only gf food is actually really good. But that it hasn’t made you any less of a cook!

doggos,f86ixvn,t1_f86hvli,1574299357.0,Yesss!! There’s more photos where this came from. I should post the one of him licking his lips!!
Periods,f86iver,t1_f85lfag,1574299311.0,"Basically a diaper for adults. Lol! Typically it’s used for people who are older, or recovering from a surgery and can’t get to the bathroom that easily, or may wet the bed. But imma just use it for my period. Cause like, my flow is basically Niagara Falls."
Periods,f86iphk,t1_f85eym9,1574299193.0,"I’ve considered it, but for some reason the cloth aspect freaks me out? Plus I hate doing laundry, and I’d probably let them sit for a little too long... I dunno tho, maybe I’ll buy a pair, and test them and the depends, to see which I like better. Cause I definitely want to save the environment as much as I can. Used to use a period cup. Which I could wear overnight (but I also used the big one, that is recommended for those who have had kids). And I psyched myself out into thinking I was going to get TSS, even tho tampons have a higher risk of that. And even then I doubt I’ll get it."
Periods,f86ieb8,t1_f852qgj,1574298972.0,"Omg, this is amazing. I’m actually having a foot surgery soon, and didn’t even think about how these could actually help with me whilst on my period. I may end up wearing them to work..."
Periods,f86iaqw,t1_f84z1vy,1574298902.0,"Yesss, I use those and they’ve helped so much. Only I still leak. D:"

Periods,f7wu5w5,t1_f7wnh5x,1574038148.0,"You should be able to go to a planned parenthood. They’re really good about working with your financial situations! I think this is something to look into. Maybe also buy some Vagisil  (don’t know the spelling!) but it’s helped me with some vaginal irritation before. You could also be more prone to getting vaginal infections on your period? I know I have gotten yeast infections because of my period before. (Yes I cleanse myself) you can also use vaginal wipes when going to the restroom. They’re flushable, great, and make you feel extra great!!"
cats,f7wth1u,t3_dxq3hj,1574037646.0,She is beautiful!! I’m sending her love from afar!!
MomForAMinute,f7wt51u,t1_f7v4iyt,1574037450.0,"I’m going through a very similar experience. But just switch Jehovah’s Witness with the Mormon cult. My who family recently cut me out of their lives. If you need an Internet sister, I’m here for you!"
MomForAMinute,f7wssu2,t3_dxred2,1574037294.0,"I just had a panic attack like 20 minutes ago. Finally coming down from it, open up Reddit, and this is the first thing I see. I am now bawling again, but from happiness and love. Thank you for being our internet mom <3"

actuallesbians,f7ujgbt,t1_f7oovl5,1574015290.0,It’s hard to find them!
MomForAMinute,f7ujcfc,t1_f7moeud,1574015251.0,Love it! Would’ve done the same!

What sock color did you choose?!"
LesbianActually,f7m6kne,t1_f7lpzut,1573855691.0,Thanks!
Celiac,f7lb93j,t1_f7kjnzq,1573836747.0,Good to know!
actuallesbians,f7lb58a,t1_f7jwca7,1573836680.0,My exact thoughts!
actuallesbians,f7jwn14,t1_f7jw8nr,1573788404.0,I do see where you’re coming from. Luckily in my case all my cis gay male friends are really great! But I definitely do believe that every type of person can be this way. I was just so frustrated with two very straight male “friends” today.
actuallesbians,f7jw2b0,t3_dwajse,1573787971.0,"Holy shit y’all, I just got the WORST message because I called men pigs on here. I didn’t mean every man is a pig, but I’m pretty sure it was made by the guy who has been harassing me. Account was made today. I reported it. 

He told me that he hopes I get cancer, and know what it feels like to be alone. Called me all sorts of names, and a sexist bigot. I reported the comment and account. But holy shit."
Celiac,f7jvm5e,t1_f7i3v8j,1573787631.0,"I order from papa johns a lot, and I personally haven’t had issues. But like they could also just like buy a frozen gf pizza? We have a kitchen at work that I could cook it in. Lol! Oh well, I always tell them I’m just gonna being my own food now. Not worth it."
actuallesbians,f7jvh65,t1_f7huvqt,1573787526.0,"So I did confront him. Told him I wanted to discuss it. But I was also working, and having to take calls. He kept blowing up my phone. Sent me a million and one texts, and each one was definitely him gaslighting me. He got sooo defensive, that that was a confirmation to me that he was doing just what I thought. He then called me 20 something times in a row. I blocked his number, and then he called me another 20+ times from an unknown caller Id. So I couldn’t block that. I answered and was like “you gotta stop right now”. He kept asking me to explain cause he didn’t understand. And I was like, I messaged you. It’s in writing. I already explained. He then continued to call me from another unknown number, and then his roommates phone. He then got the hint. And quit calling. Only to then send me an email. Trying to put blame onto me. When all I wanted was to talk to him calmly about it. But he’s the one who freaked the fuck out. I have told him if he tries again, I will file a restraining order. And I don’t joke about that."
actuallesbians,f7jv1pr,t1_f7i3ut2,1573787199.0,"Ok well that’s good! I have a guy I did go out with (before I realized I was for sure gay) he will occasionally be like, Are you sure your gay? Yes. You were my final reason. Lol!"
actuallesbians,f7juy7f,t1_f7hv92k,1573787128.0,Exactly! I’m glad my “friend” doesn’t know where I live. And if you have to say that about someone. Then you probably shouldn’t be their friend.
