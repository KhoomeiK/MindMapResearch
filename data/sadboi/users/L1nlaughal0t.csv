My family have been really supportive each time I've ended up at crisis point, so I want to be honest and see if that helps prevent me getting to that point. Like I feel so isolated when I'm hiding how bad it is, so maybe it's better for me to be honest?

I recently tried to tell someone how bad it had got for me, but didn't get any help from them. It took a month to build myself up again and talk to someone else. Luckily she is listening and giving me the support I want. But if she hadn't, I would have been trying to accept that and working on asking again.
