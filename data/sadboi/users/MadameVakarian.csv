Also do you need any of the other clips louder or cleaned up more?"

I suppose if you like these Mandalorian videos ([this](https://youtu.be/HnZ0n0Vx1Xc) and [this](https://youtu.be/Bk-e-juMt9A)) and have other social media, maybe share them there I guess? That's the only thing I can really think of in terms of repayment haha (they're why I have the footage in the first place)"
TheMandalorianTV,fkbxvnz,t1_fkbt9k1,1584041975.0,"[Here's some rough pulls](https://www.mediafire.com/file/1evh58d4cdcnu0d/raw.zip/file), minimal effects to dampen the music. Now, my memory is complete garbage and the only two times I remember Mando saying ""This is The Way"" are in Episodes 3 and 8. I assume you don't want to use the one from 8 where he's dying, so I used the one in 3. That one is over a ton of music and sounds effects, I did a rough extraction pass so it sounds a little tinny, but let me know if you remember any other episodes where he says it that might be a bit clearer and I'll grab that for you."

AskReddit,fit8g4c,t3_f9kd1v,1582709353.0,"While directing a feature-length project for nine days straight, mostly 12+ hour shoots, couldn’t get more than an hour of sleep because I couldn’t stop thinking about the next day, I developed a fever about three days in. Figured it was stress, as I had no other symptoms. Every day it got higher and higher. The second to last day was all outdoors in the middle of August. I got a sunburn, and when I got home I finally felt exhausted enough to sleep. Got under the covers, passed out.

Woke up blind, my body was in more pain than I’d ever felt (so far) and my limbs felt so heavy I couldn’t move for a few minutes. Wasn’t sure if the problem was that I just couldn’t lift my eyelids, so I raised a finger to check. Poked myself right in my open eyeball.

I had no idea what to do so I just kicked off the covers and laid there until I could see again. Hopped up to take my temperature - 106. Like an IDIOT I just decided to pop some Tylenol and wait to see if it went down. The next day was our final shoot and it’d only be a few hours. I was so focused on finishing the project that I didn’t want to go to the hospital.

After about 30 minutes my fever went down to 103 and I decided that was good enough to go back to sleep.

Next morning went smoothly, finished the shoot, got iHop, had the wrap party that night. I figured since the fever was stress related I’d feel better in the next day or two.

Five days later I still had it. Finally one night it went up to 104 and I decided to call a friend to take me to the emergency room. Waited for 4 hours, didn’t get seen, felt miserable so I went home.

Next morning we went to an urgent care center in the wealthy part of town - was seen and diagnosed immediately. Mono. Didn’t think it was possible since up until then my only symptom had been a high fever, but within two days my tonsils were so swollen they were touching.

My roommate was out of town this entire time, so I was by myself - which I didn’t mind until the swelling got to it’s worst point.

I was taking a nap when I suddenly felt very weird. Wasn’t sure what was happening, can’t remember what I was dreaming about but I thought it had to do with whatever was happening within that. The feeling gets worse and worse, my head starts to hurt and my limbs felt tingly. Thankfully that was enough to wake me up and I realized I was choking.

Immediately sat up and within seconds I could breathe again. My tonsils had gotten so big that when I laid down for some reason they cut off my airway. Texted my mom in a panic and built a nest of blankets and pillows to keep myself upright. Slept sitting up from then on.

Days passed and the pain was only getting worse and breathing was becoming difficult even sitting up. My mom drove six hours to come take me to urgent care again where they said it was one of the most severe cases of mono they’d ever seen and prescribed me a heavy dose of steroids on the spot.

Within a day or two I began to recover, just in time for the first day of my senior year. Missed all of my morning classes but felt good enough to go to my final one in the afternoon.

The entire rest of the semester I carried around hand sanatizer and Clorox wipes, cleaned every desk and chair I sat in in the hopes that I wouldn’t spread my illness and also because I didn’t want to risk catching anything else.

I was exhausted for months and probably lost about 20 pounds because I lost my appetite for a long time. I’ve never gotten checked but I’m pretty sure I suffered some brain damage. There are so many gaps in my memory from high school through college, and I’m now way more forgetful than I was before.

TL;DR: got a severe case of mono and felt like I was going to die for a month, almost choked on my own tonsils."

Rhythm is always something I've prided myself on! I used to be a drummer and then a dancer, so it progressed into editing pretty easily. I'm really glad to hear that it translates, even if in baby steps. Also thank you for the creativity note! That's the #1 thing I hope to translate with my work - so if it made it through the scrappiness that's the best I can hope for!"

P.S. I recommend watching with subtitles!

Edit: he's also longtime BFFs with Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron) which is neat. And there's links to all the full interviews in the description."
