BPD,fbcmhui,t3_ecezdi,1576727531.0,I talk to myself constantly and lately I‚Äôve been hard on myself about it. I act out scenarios with other people but then realize that I‚Äôm making them act in ways that they don‚Äôt and that feels inappropriate to me. Like in the same way it‚Äôd be inappropriate to write fanfiction about someone you know. Also I feel crappy because then I get these idealized thoughts of how I want a situation to go and get upset when it doesn‚Äôt go that way.

AskReddit,f3uqsn9,t3_di8aob,1571165905.0,"Not me, but my ex-boyfriend‚Äôs parents. Not sure exactly how long but it was definitely at least 18 years. They didn‚Äôt actually divorce iirc, just separated on good terms. His mom explained it to me once: they made a family together and we‚Äôre proud of what they‚Äôd done but just weren‚Äôt in love anymore. They were perfectly cordial with each other and did outings with their two sons and did technically still live in the same house. But both of them had other SOs that they spent a lot of time with. I met his dad‚Äôs girlfriend and his mom went away for small periods of time to be with her new boyfriend. It‚Äôs been a few years since this ex and I broke up, but I really do miss his family. I wish I could join it without being with him, we really weren‚Äôt a good match and are much better as friends. But I liked his parents a lot!"
