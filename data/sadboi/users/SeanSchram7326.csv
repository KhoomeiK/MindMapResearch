BorderlinePDisorder,fqij2fl,t1_fqi929q,1589396661.0,"That's fantastic. Sounds like you got a good work ethic. The first thing I'd say that I had to learn is to have a specific plan what you want to do next and understand you start at the bottom each time. I understand how impatient you are due to wanting to get further in life, I can relate, but the catch is you have to start all over again when you leave. That could mean cut hours and such.

I had to learn I gotta get really good at something first before I move onto more things or everything will end up half assed. There is no shortcut to mastery. So my point is don't let your impatience be the driver of you moving on, let the driver be that you feel you have gone as far as you can somewhere to move onto something else. If you don't do this, you'll constantly get impatience and the cycle starts over and over again. You should be afraid of taking risks, but you should be more afraid not to. You gotta be responsible about it though.

BorderlinePDisorder,fpdyzz3,t1_fpdvmny,1588537064.0,"Well to know where to aim, you have to know where the target is, or you're firing blindly. Also, if you have no target, you have no idea how much you are missing the target.

I encourage you to make a list of all your goals and pick two at a time: probably one being a financial priority/responsibility and one extracaricular.

Example for me: Building my business and my music.

Extra tip: Make a schedule that doesn't have you do the same thing everyday. For example: schedule them every other day a part. This will help getting less bored/numb as us with BPD do. In other words, do what you can to not do the same thing within 24 hours.

Ex. Work on one thing Monday, Wed, Fri. The other thing Tues, Thurs, Sat. Maybe give yourself Sunday off for YOUR day off/mental health day. This is what I do. You organize that to fit your life.

Not doing the same thing within 24 hours of each will also help motivate you to do it more because if you choose not to do it one day, you'll have to wait 2 days to do it again and you'll be behind. Keeps you accountable.

Ex. If I choose to exercise Monday, Wed, Fri, and I choose not to do it on Wed, then that will be pressure on me to either do it one extra day OR disappointing myself in a way until Fri.

I encourage you to be flexible when you have to chance your schedule. Being attached to a schedule too much can also cause more anxiety than needed. Sometimes things pop up and you have to re-evaluate your schedule. I sometimes have to re-evaluate my schedule several times in a week till I get it mostly right. It realistically won't ever be 100% cuz that's just life. 

My to do list contains the most mundane things such as brushing my teeth to more specific things such as Business stuff. A good start is the Take Care of Yourself First list on KidsHelpPhone website. If you can't find that, I'll gladly help you find that.

These are some coping mechanisms I've learned.

All that is your concentration being devided by different things, and not one thing gets 100% of your concentration then. I'm not saying this practise of mine came to me over night, I'm still practising to work just on one thing at a time, I still get impatient, but I encourage you to practise with me.

Some people asked me follow up about coping with and making a change from such matters.

The first thing to realize is knowing what ""no"" actually means. Doctor Jordan Peterson talks about ""no"" either meaning: ""There's nothing you can do to change my mind"" OR ""I'm only willing to play for higher stakes.""

This goes hand in hand with people pleasing. To be honest about what you feel and how you act dispite the concequences. Not everyone is going to agree with everything you do. The question here is, ""Would you rather tell or do something that somebody wants you to do just to keep them around?"" If that's the case, I encourage you to think what that questions means for yourself. If a person puts that pressure on you, they are manipulating you to please them.

Experts also say most people don't have any boundaries at all, which is disgustingly horrible. If healthy boundaries are put in place, then a person can tell if they are being too angry or not if those boundaries are violated. Now that I have boundaries in my life, whenever I am angry, I don't second guess myself."

BorderlinePDisorder,fo4kjbp,t3_g5io9p,1587506091.0,"I'm happy for you! With my BPD, I have learned to compare myself to myself yesterday, instead of ""what should be."" This helped me with being less hard on myself when I make a mistake. We are not free from mistakes as humans, but can be free of ""a majority percentage"" of mistakes. :)"
BPD,fntfqwb,t3_g3pzze,1587240749.0,"Tell them where to go, but first tell them to talk to me another male BPD. Haha. That's rubbish. It's only ""feminine"" because women are historically more in touch with their emotions. There are also men like me (26) who are more in touch with their feminine side than other men. As a male BPD, I got your back."
BorderlinePDisorder,fnsfyf2,t1_fnrpe3w,1587220785.0,Thanks ;3 I encourage you to wear a mental illness like a badge too (assuming you have one responding to this)
BorderlinePDisorder,fnrl5yb,t3_g3isgu,1587192476.0,"Tell those therapists where to go. If you're under 18 they won't diagnose you yes. If you are an adult though and they won't diagnose you, get a diagnoses so you can be taken seriously and get the help you need. Take DBT regardless. It's helpful for people even without the ""diagnoses."" DBT was specifically made for BPD at first by a person with BPD because back then there was nothing working for BPD treatment."
BPD,fnl2vpp,t1_fnktdp5,1587045875.0,It's already worked for me so far if speaking from experience gives you some validation. :) Glad I can help

BPD,fnjgw2e,t1_fnjgpbe,1586998721.0,Glad I can help. I encourage you to put those reminders somewhere you'll see all the time.
BorderlinePDisorder,fnilheb,t1_fnii8us,1586982061.0,"From my life experience, regardless of having BPD, is people and life changes. I try not to get attached to people or anything"
BorderlinePDisorder,fnihxtn,t1_fnha5ok,1586980299.0,"That must be tough. Do you feel that obligation to support is stronger than your will to look out for yourself, while you're instinct is not to be around him?"
BorderlinePDisorder,fnh9ovs,t3_g1nvz9,1586958107.0,"Does he know you have BPD? That we basically are empaths at a 110% level?

What I have learned about my BPD is attachment leads to suffering. Do you really want someone around who is that negative?"
BorderlinePDisorder,fnh9cly,t1_fnghzgm,1586957896.0,I hear that. So that would be one variable to balance out. What do you think? :)
BPD,fng9xxk,t3_g1cytt,1586926058.0,"Have you ever heard that experts say that chemically ""love"" can be compared to a drug addiction?"
BorderlinePDisorder,fneytid,t3_g125tl,1586898340.0,"My experience with my BPD is consistency/routine is key because we are characteristicly dysregulated to begin with. Have you been practising what experts call ""good sleep hygiene?"""
BPD,fnd9o2q,t1_fnbok8c,1586863904.0,Fair enough. Thank you for the input. I came to the same sort of conclusion.
BPD,fnbfzpm,t3_g0jf6v,1586814865.0,"Used to. One word: assertiveness and learning the meaning of no. ""No either means: There's nothing you can do to change my mind or I'm only willing to play for higher stakes"" - Dr. Jordan Peterson. I have BPD and this lesson changed my life"
BorderlinePDisorder,fn2n1xa,t3_fyw60g,1586595214.0,"That is common among everybody even without BPD. The world is full of an infinite amount of facts and can be seperated into relevant and irrelevant facts with goals. When you add a new goal, such as a relationship, Irrelevant facts that didn't matter before do now, and that can be overwhelming. Does that make sense?"
BPD,fmkdclk,t3_fviwwe,1586151265.0,"Those people who paint us as anti-social are just using that as an excuse to not validate us. I can relate. What this Disorder has taught me is compassion, especially for those people, but what unwavering loyalty does is actually harm us, not them"
BorderlinePDisorder,fmgjjjx,t3_fv4mw5,1586050453.0,"This is upsetting, but I thank you for posting this. It's eye opening. Just know you're not alone. :)"
