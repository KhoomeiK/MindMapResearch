BPD,f2f7mlq,t3_dd45an,1570212464.0,"I wasted years in a relationship like this because I was too afraid to be alone.  I finally left because I realized that until I was happy on my own, I couldn't be happy (or healthy) in a relationship. Therapy really helped with this too, I highly recommend it. This is really really hard but I promise you it's not as hard as what you're doing to yourself right now by staying. Sometimes we prefer to stick with the familiar because it's easier. In the long run, you are only hurting yourself though. Work on yourself and do things that make YOU happy. Then you can focus on being with someone who understand you and wants to be there for you. Stay strong no matter what you decide. <3"
BPD,f1zy9n4,t3_db1mqk,1569852230.0,"You have no idea how much I needed to hear this. Both because it reminds me I'm not alone and helps me make a big decision. My FP and I broke up almost a year ago. I'm still not over him even though I've dated other people and he has a new GF now. I've considered moving to a bigger city where I wont run into him or his friends or have memories of places we've been. Your story makes me realize that physically distancing myself may be best. If I do, I will certainly not date so theres no chance I can have a new FP and may have a better chanve at finding myself. Thank you so much and stay strong."
aww,f1ift56,t3_d9eq9c,1569509979.0,SO incredibly true!

BPD,f0lrizq,t3_d5bmpf,1568727693.0,"yes! I never knew other people felt the same way. It feels like in some way if I was at all interested in them and they are now dating someone else they have ""rejected"" me. I know it's ridiculous  and get over it but it still happens."
BPD,f0ig5y9,t3_d4z6il,1568641247.0,Thank you for this! We all need to reminded of this sometimes.
BPD,ezup1tz,t3_d2ec80,1568157672.0,I feel the same exact way and worry about it all the time because I've ended relationships with good people. When I talk to my therapist or friends they just say I haven't met the right person. It's hard to believe that. I'm sorry I dont have much advice but know you are not alone.
BPD,ezl244l,t3_d1ca48,1567970493.0,Yes! It's a huge decision for me to go out drinking because it can last up to a couple days and it's not always worth it. There is a reason it does and it's not just people that have BPD. I do think I get it worse than most people though. Here's the article. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.self.com/story/hangover-anxiety/amp
BPD,ezjzk1e,t3_d17pqt,1567952637.0,Thank you. This helps more than you know.
BPD,ez9l47q,t3_d08qn1,1567784652.0,"Yes the only way around these feelings is to love and value yourself. You have to start there otherwise you will always base your feelings on someone else's and your happiness will be subject to how they treat you. If you have a solid foundation for yourself, you won't tolerate being mis-treated or rejected because you always will have yourself and that will be ok to you. It's a long hard journey but I can tell you from personal experience, it's the only thing that has truly helped me in years. I have much healthier relationships now."

BPD,extkun8,t3_cu077z,1566570530.0,"Yes I do this and have ruined relationships over it. It's very ""black and white"" thinking. The fact of you being aware of it should help you in the future."

BPD,exoulmh,t3_ctrnsn,1566481961.0,I feel that way with my dad and my ex. I feel these negative vibes just shooting at me from everywhere and it makes me really tense and uncomfortable. I'm not sure if they are true narcissists or they just have a lot of personality traits of one. I still love them but don't like being around them. The feeling is overwhelming that I need to get away.
BPD,exosqsj,t3_ctuxk2,1566481236.0,Yes this happens to me to.
self,exorb1i,t3_ctklk4,1566480673.0,Thank you for this.
BPD,exlbnoe,t3_ctgwti,1566409870.0,I agree. I was the same way with my dog. We did everything together. He recently passed away unexpectedly one night. Make sure you cherish your cat every second you have her.
BPD,exkqkpd,t1_exjjww7,1566396624.0,"Hey I just wanted to let you know I'm going through the same thing right now. I'll be 30 in October and I struggle with staying here because I suffer so much. We need to stay strong because things always get better. In the past when I've gotten this way, I just focus on doing little things for myself until I get the confidence to do larger things. Brush your teeth, cook healthy food, go outside, exercise. When you do small stuff it gives you the momentum you need to get through the hard stuff. I'm back to being at a low point after my favorite person (who is a dog) just passed away but at one point I climbed my way out of all this and genuinely was happy. I'll get there again and so will you. Stay strong <3. Message me if you need to."
BPD,exkq7ro,t3_ct8g8i,1566396374.0,I'm glad you are still here with us and I'm very happy you are finding your way. It is a constant struggle and it takes A LOT of hard work to get yourself in a good place in life where you can be happy. Remember these good feelings if life gets dark again. I am proud of you!
BPD,exkp555,t1_exhzqqd,1566395642.0,"My therapist suggests that I focus on myself and giving myself a solid foundation. He said it's easy to blame him for my anxiety, bad feelings, low self-esteem etc. and hard to look at myself and take responsibility for how I'm doing. He also asked me if we got back together right now would it be a healthy good relationship for me and the answer is no. He said to just keep telling myself that. The point is if I'm happy with myself then I won't care as much about his actions. He won't have control over my emotions if I have control over them. Easier said than done..."
BPD,exhyrhf,t3_ct14xg,1566317277.0,"I""m in the same place as you except i'm only a year out from our last breakup. We talked about a couple things that had nothing to do with our relationship through text but other than that we haven't kept in contact. It kills me he doesn't ask how I am or how I've been doing considering he knows my mental health history. I found out he has a new girlfriend and it's killing me. He's not even on social media but I saw a picture of them two from a friend of a friend and ended up looking her up. I have no idea how to fix this or make it better. I've been on an off with him for the past 6 years and we've both had relationships in between and i've never ever gotten over him even though I've dated other people. I go to a therapist and it helps but it doesnt fix it. My therapist suggests focusing on yourself and not letting another person affect your feelings. The problem is just thinking about what he could be feeling about me or not feeling about me still affects me. I have no idea what to do because it's been years and years I've felt like this about him. I thought he could be the one if we could see a therapist together but he refused. I want to tell him I found out what was wrong with me (undiagnosed BPD) and that i've been working on myself. I doubt he cares and now that he has a GF it's clear he doesn't care or isn't willing to try again and has moved on. I just live with it everyday. I hope you get the answer. Please message me if someone gives you good advice. I'm still looking for help."
BPD,exhy28f,t1_exhxakh,1566316817.0,Has anyone ever given you any suggestions? I go see a therapist and it still doesn't curve my feelings towards him. I get better and then it'll hit me like a brick that I still want him. He mistreated me too. I wasn't in a good place when I was with him yet I still want him back.
BPD,exhwjhd,t1_exerbww,1566315812.0,I live like this too and it's really hard. He has a new GF now and I still can't move on. I've been dating someone else and I still think about him and wanting him back. I've been working on myself so much since we broke up but he hasn't asked how I'm doing and rejected the idea of getting lunch and catching up. I feel pathetic having these feelings for someone who has completely moved on.
BPD,exhufy4,t3_ct085z,1566314387.0,"I was at the same place you were, that was the hardest age range for me. I think we are still hanging onto our youth and in a transition age.  I constantly looked at myself in the mirror for any new wrinkles and to see if the ones I had had gotten worse. I used to constantly talk about it and ask friends/family if I looked older or if this or that line got worse. I would also look at pictures of myself before and think how pretty/young I used to look. I used to spend hours getting ready for work or to go out. I never left the house without make up. It was exhausting and stressful. I would overly obsessed with my appearance. What I can tell you is, it gets better. I'm 29 about to be 30 and in the past 6 months, I've developed a ""fuck it"" attitude as well. I wear less make up than I have and literally don't give a shit how old people think I look. I sware I get more attention and compliments than I did when I was younger. No one's beauty or skin will last forever and that's why it's important to develop your character. If you like the person you are you will focus less on aging. 

This question really helped me too...Imagine you were about to die and someone came up to you and said, ""you have two choices. You can choose to die today and be remembered the way you look now or you can age 10 years and return back to earth. "" I think we would all choose to go live our lives even if we had to age 10 years. Life is so much more important than the way we look. If you are like me, please start working on yourself and becoming someone you like. It feels better to look and the mirror and be proud and have honor than to see a face without wrinkles. There are so many great things to come."
BPD,exeuupl,t3_csarmk,1566225907.0,This happens to me to and it's really hard to have a relationship. I turn into a different person and then it get's ruined.

AmItheAsshole,ewrmmwv,t3_cpndno,1565709011.0,"YTA. If you didn't have enough money to tip them appropriately, you shouldn't have been eating there in the first place. You don't run up a $1,000 bill and then take money away from the server who's doing his job and a good one at that. It's not up to you to reinvent the rules of tips and level of service in a restaurant. Follow the rules or don't eat at such a nice place."

BPDrecovery,ew4owbd,t3_cmp7tu,1565115214.0,I'm currently in the same situation as you. My idea was to kind of print out some information that was more accurate and less negative and have my boyfriend read that first so I can explain how it relates to me specifically. That won't stop them from doing their own research though. I wish you luck.

self,es41vzp,t3_c5pic2,1561575332.0,"This sounds familiar. I don't remember the exact name, but there is a type of depression I read about a while back that causes you to feel nothing. I had a friend that had your symptoms while still seemingly living a ""whole"" and ""successful"" life. It's confusing because nothing is wrong but yet nothing is that great either. He ended up getting help for it. Sorry for the vague response. I hope this helps."
