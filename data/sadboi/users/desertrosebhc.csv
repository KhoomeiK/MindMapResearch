I'm hoping to cook more and make and freeze some meals. I'm looking to get a little chest freezer. Oh, I have a slow cooker and an instant pot. But I like simple recipes."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fnm03ht,t1_fnkot7t,1587062746.0,"Sometimes if the abuse is physical, hurting the victim and the kids see it, it tells them that that's the way men treat women; or the opposite is the women is the abuser. In any case, the victim has contributed to the abuse. But again, it is dangerous for the victim to leave the abuser. They are more likely to be hurt severely or killed.

Unfortunately, kids seeing abuse of the victim are victims as well. It can be the better thing for the mom to turn her back on the children. But in any case, the children need therapy to keep them from being victims as they grow up.

I know that I'm probably swimming upstream on this but as a childhood survivor of sexual, emotional, and mental abuse I know it set me up for abuse all my life. My mom told me once that she should have left my dad when I was a tiny baby. It might have spared me of thinking that the way he treated me was normal and caused me to have mental illnesses all of my life."

JUSTNOFAMILY,fnjdgib,t1_fnj7o71,1586996749.0,"I agree that the children should come first. I'm not defending her but sometimes the abuser is so charming. He will hit her, beat her and then turn right around and bring her flowers or do some other romantic gesture. It makes her think that just maybe he is going to treat her better. But we know that isn't the case.

My abuser didn't hit me yet, but eventually he would have. My children were grown but he tried to come between us. He pulled me away from the from my friends and my church family. The abuser doesnt want the victim to talk to anyone and if you do, you pay for it.

I didn't know what agencies were available to help me. I didn't think I could go to the safe house because my abuse was mental and emotional so I was surprised that that wasn't the casefor . I didn't even think it was abuse as my father had treated me that way and others in my life treated me that way. If you don't know anything else how can you think you are being abused.

The lightbulb moment was when he told me, ""If you would just do what I tell you to do, everything would be alright."" That's when I began to realize that I was being abused. But there seemed to be no way out. I was virtually a prisoner. I didn't know anybody where he had moved me to and he made me pay the rent and utilities so I had nothing left. But, praise the Lord, an opportunity presented itself and I took it. 

I have been NC for 3 years. I do not want to see him again. There is still a tiny spark for him even tho I know that he would probably do what he threatened to do which is take me out in the desert and nobody would find me.

It is a gray area, not a black and white one. I'm just trying to help people understand. Letting your children be abused or not caring about them is not what should happen."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fnibmf3,t3_g1uhz8,1586977250.0,"Being in an abusive relationship and getting out of it is hard. You begin to have Stockholm syndrome. You love and think that somehow, someway, he will change.

Then when you finally get the courage to leave, you have to be very careful. When you are leaving your abuser, that is the most dangerous time. 

How do i know this? I was in an abusive relationship not that long ago. Thank God I was able to get away while he was at work. I left everything I owned behind and I had no money."
budgetfood,fni70xs,t1_fni62gj,1586975060.0,"I don't have much space in my freezer in the refrigerator. I am thinking about buying a small apartment size.

The house I live in has two apartments with an inside connecting door. My apt is a studio apartment and the other one is a two bedroom apartment. It's occupied by two friends of mine. They bring me something to eat once in a while. My preference in food is a little more country or soul food. I grew up on rice and beans."

Things have been a bit crazy trying to get ready to have the house fumigated. I had to pack up like I was moving. But today is the day for fumigation and we will be going to a hotel that will let me take my cat."
airfryer,fni2gom,t1_fngs67o,1586972852.0,I don't have one yet. I had very few possessions as I had just escaped an abusive relationship and had to leave everything behind. A blender is on the list of needed items.
