environment,fq7jb7j,t1_fq5scw5,1589147135.0,"Well, specifically capitalism as seen in the United States has been set up by western thought to lead to materialism (in the economic sense, ergo, not philosophical) and consumerism. Big agriculture is a symptom of greed, alienation and environmental destruction. Greed in the sense that the United States lovesss to eat. A lot. Our appetites have been expanded to consume and consume. Alienation in the sense that the things we eat are separated from the means of production. In our case, this means that the meat, dairy and eggs we consume are produced outside of the public eye. Out of sight, out of mind, kind of thing. Finally, I would like to point out that it’s a fallacy that we need factory farming. As mystical as this sounds, the world is artificially out of balance due to the amount of consumption and factory farming is occurring. The population is inflated and our “standard” of living is also inflated due to our way to “out-engineer” planetary boundaries. This being said, factory farming is not a necessity, meaning that if we didn’t have it, humanity could continue to thrive and even grow sustainably. I would recommend looking up regenerative agriculture if you’re interested in seeing a positive movement in the way of farming. If you need clarification on any point please ask. Thanks."
