BPD,flfe8kr,t3_fohoxk,1585104366.0,"This hit super close to home. I remember my mother taking me to numerous forms of therapy to try and find out what the problem was (spoiler: it was her) and eventually settling on autism. I ended up going through a load of communication and emotional expression courses and went absolutely mental as none of it resonated with me. I slowly realised something was wrong with me but that it wasn't autism, and after digging found out about BPD and it fit like a glove. When trying to get help I was excluded from diagnosis and treatment as I had an autism diagnosis. I never remembered getting it and after finally getting a diagnosis review that came out inconclusive, I requested access to my full medical record. Though there were mentions of traits, it was never deemed sufficient for diagnosis and it looks like my mother probably made it up while changing doctors at some point. Took all the evidence to my doctor and he agreed to write a letter confirming the lack of diagnosis. I've now been put forward for actual treatment. And then corona virus happened.

I know the world is fucked up at the moment. I am in exactly the same boat as you and if you don't live through this, I for one would be upset. Healthcare is really stretched at the moment and of course mental health is going to feel it the worst as it's less fundamental, but not necessarily less important, than physical health. All we can do is grin and bear it, but we're used to having to do that. I feel I'm a bit ahead of you in the treatment process as I have my diagnoses finalised (hopefully), so the best advice I can offer is that if you push hard and fight your corner, it will get better. It just might be a while until you can actually get it fixed."

The best thing you can do for yourself is to try your hardest to get better. But sometimes you can be doing everything you can and it doesn't work. In those cases we need help from other people. Which is also fine as long as you strive not to lean on them too much. That can be difficult to judge and often we  beat ourselves up over help we get because we forget they do it out of love and end up thinking we're selfish, because we struggle to believe we're loved."

BPD,fi509yc,t3_f6esv9,1582152116.0,"I've strongly considered sectioning myself before. The information you're looking for is [here](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/legal-rights/voluntary-patients/about-voluntary-patients/). The PDF is especially thorough. I should warn you to think carefully about it though. Most people who are sectioned experience an immediate worsening to their symptoms before getting better. If you section yourself, you'll probably be in there for a while. Speak to your doctor as soon as possible to discuss alternatives, or try and get seen by your local hospital's psych liaison if it's urgent. Whatever you choose to do, I wish you the best."
BPD,fhpg8r7,t1_fhpfu5x,1581788897.0,"I'm afraid there isn't much of an alternative, it's a trial and error process. What are your biggest symptoms? It might help to find someone with similar ones and see what worked for them. Or if your current meds aren't working, ask your doctor for something that works differently rather than trying something similar to what you've already got."

There's no such thing as a best one, and it can take months of trying out different ones to find one that works for you. What might be amazing for one person might be useless or even detrimental to another as everyone has an individual internal chemistry. This is something to speak to your doctor about."

After seeing a psychiatrist I was misdiagnosed with depression due to being in a depressive phase and offered antidepressants, which I refused because I felt they wouldn't properly address the problem. After a long fight to get seen again, I was seen given a diagnostic assessment by a psychiatric nurse and I only told them at the end I thought I had BPD so that it wouldn't affect their own assessment. Though they couldn't diagnose, they informally agreed with me and I got an appointment with the psychiatrist later on and got my diagnosis. A big factor in my misdiagnosis was being too guarded when describing my experiences, which I eventually learned to work around."

I always considered them 'they' as opposed to 'we' and don't think I qualify as having DID but I've definitely experienced these symptoms. I've always thought it to be an extreme form of dissociation, and it's very difficult to tell whether it's just a result of BPD or if I do actually have DID tendencies."

Even though its objectively bad, I feel great though so I try and make the most of it while also trying to minimise financial damage and unhealthy activity.
