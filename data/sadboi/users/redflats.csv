I truly hope that it all works out for you in the end. 

Thanks for the check, dumb bitch. ;)"
AskWomenOver30,fo9dvlx,t3_g6fuxz,1587616847.0,"You are allowed to feel all those things. I'm only a couple years ahead of you, but if I didn't have all the things I have right now (job, husband that can watch our beautiful 2 kids while he works his startup, a home, living in a very progressive city, etc), I would certainly feel the same as you. 

I'd like to offer you a few ideas to help you get unstuck. From my very outside perspective, this seems like a really wonderful opportunity for you to spend time with your family and do some bonding, silly, and loving things with them. This is sort of the age when we know who we are, don't take shit from people, and are given the space to be ourselves (pending you do not have a narcissistic or abusive parent, which doesn't sound like you do). In the healthy scenario, you can enjoy their company, while finding things in common, differences you can argue about in a healthy manner, etc. Since your mom is an NP, can you make some creative nutrition rich meals for her to take to work and to eat when she gets home? What's your other parent up to? Can you get some lessons from him on how to remain financially stable when you return to work (not that you aren't savvy already, but just an idea to learn from the smart ones)? And/or can you come up with projects to work on to improve their home (with or without their help)? 

Our bodies change and it does go downhill from here, but you CAN workout with tons of online videos that don't require weights, or you could do one of those couch to 5K things if you're not able to do a 5k yet. You could build something with your hands and TIME, plant a garden, do a paint by numbers, etc. SO many great opportunities to explore activities you never had the time for. There are certainly moments in the past several weeks that I have wished I was literally you - no job, got to go home and live with my parents, drink whatever I want, paint all day, explore music, movies, and shows, READ, declutter, clean, sip  a cold beverage on a warm Spring day in a backyard listening to a string quartet. I'm serious. Two kids under 4 and a demanding job, with shitty weather.. UGH. I AM TIRED AF. 

Anyway. I apologize for the big sister talk, instead of the commissary. I wish you health and all the best."

I‚Äôd say something more classic from a thrift shop, that is white. That said, I noticed above your kitchen cabinets having some extra open space. How about putting those bookshelf books up there along with some small vine plants? You could even get a canvas type box To store some shoes up there that aren‚Äôt right for the season. 

The cart should go. Propping up the sofa or the bed by even 8 inches will give you a bunch of storage under there. Shoes or your books (and you could but those in rotation, instead of year round display). Find a home for your cleaning supplies besides right when you walk in. Maybe hide them behind your sofa. 

Take your computer wires and tie them to line the desk, cover with a white cable cover or the like, so they blend in better.
