BPD,fmp3jkf,t3_fwjtjy,1586273751.0,Last week was horrible for me. Very intensely suicidal. Whining under my bedsheets for days. Then it got a little bit better. I think it will come in waves.
Edinburgh,fcgun37,t1_fcfprmt,1577644154.0,I’ve succumbed to the fact that the NHS won’t cover the therapy I need. I’m paying privately. It’s my second largest expense after the mortgage... and I know being able to afford it is a privilege many don’t have.

BPD,eym9wfn,t3_cx35g3,1567203244.0,"I think I experience this, too. I’m just not sure if these are real memories or hallucinations. When these memories come back to you, is it a gradual thing, like you start recalling more and more details? Because it freaks me out how I can completely forget important, emotionally charged events, and then remember them weeks or months later in so much detail! Exact words a person has said, how they made me feel, hand gestures, etc. Even objects on their desk if they caught my attention at the time for some reason."
