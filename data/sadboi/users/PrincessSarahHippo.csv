BPD,f8bkcv5,t1_f8aoeic,1574438919.0,"I am sorry for the loss of your kitten. Losing a pet is terrible, especially when it is sudden. I had to go to grief therapy after my first dog died. Something I learned there- and this might sound really dumb- write letters to who you lost. I know writing letters to a dead pet sounds silly af, but it really helped. You could also make a little box with pictures and the collar and stuff like that. Your kitten was your best friend, so he loved you and he would never want you to hurt yourself."
BPD,f8bj7y2,t3_dztm95,1574438155.0,"That is great! I don't think your cat is going to reinforce issues. Pets are healthy, it has been proven by soooo many studies that having an animal in your life improves your mental health. One of the little dogs I adopted two years ago is a lot like your cat. I call her my velcro dog."

Based on the shirt description  I worked there at the same time as OP. I still go there for most of my pet stuff. I think it says a lot that I'm still loyal to a store/company that fired me.  I wouldn't get a dog I hated groomed or vetted at the one near me, but that is a different matter."
