Assimilation meant my generation never heard the Daina, we didn't even know they existed. It's only recently I've noticed a glaring absence in my multi-cultural heritage, and have starting looking for the stories that were never told to me. Thank you for sharing that vid. It's very meaningful to hear/see these songs put into context. I find profound beauty in how they convey a sense of connection to  nature. 

Are there any other vids or resources that you'd recommend for learning more? 

My family came from the  Latgale/Vidzeme/Selonia region, if that means anything to you. I get the impression some traditions are unique to certain areas, or different places will have their own version/interpretation. 

Thanks for the reply, I appreciate these thoughtful responses very much!!!"

I am very intrigued and excited to learn more about Latvian history and culture! The tradititions, rituals, stories and festivals. Its all very compelling. It feels like a treasure trove I cant open yet, because language is a key I don't have. Its also kind of strange to learn that stuff in abstract, through a computer screen.

Very keen to visit.

The workload is increasing, and we have no job security. As casuals, if we get sick, we don't get paid. 

There's lots of shiny PR messaging but very little in the way of tangible, on the ground support. It's causing extreme stress and anxiety. Teachers are on the front line.

We are in extreme circumstances, though.   

Mum was supposed to hook me up with an 8 pack today, but the store didnt deliver. I got a 4 pack. Thats not enough to make me feel like that situation is sorted but tonight I had the urge so I went to take a poop. It was just blood and blood clots. The poop wouldnt come out.

aspergers,fj00540,t3_falwyh,1582882767.0,"This thread is an awesome rabbit hole. 

I've always been urked by this in the context of romantic love. I've always felt like the person is in love with ""the idea of me"" rather than the ""reality of me"".  
  
 I was only diagnosed recently. So now i can frame this in the context of masking, i.e. they fall in love with a masked version of me, which is something I have carefully crafted, rather than the messyness of my reality.  
  
I think I have always been aware of this, though. The fact I exist as a character in other people's narrative. From early on I put energy into ""masking"" - or what i would prefer to describe as ""characterisation"". I was mindful of exagerating the parts of my character that would be recieved well in a social setting. Essentially, identifying stuff that I thought was cool, and using that to shape my persona/character.   
  
 I'm still socially anxious and awkward but people see me from far away, involved in creative, musicial stuff, and think I'm cool/interesting. This has been no end of help in developing new connections.

I don't think it's a bad thing. Its a mask but also my character. I like performing if its related to a special interest area (art or music) - those situations energise me because it helps my character grow. Otherwise it can get tiring. It takes a lot of energy if I don't feel like pandering to that idea of how I should be.  
  
 Overall, though, I find it a pretty functional/useful approach. 

It's effective in all situations except romantic love, where being appreciated for your authentic self is the most important thing. Rather, it's pretty depressing having people love ""the cool idea"" then bail when they realise you're a sensitive, imperfect, messy, sometimes hard-to-understand human. It's happened a lot. 

Grateful I at least now have a better framework to process this, though."

""It was long known that an optimal arch follows an inverted catenary curve, i.e., an upside-down hanging chain.

australia,fao5h2b,t3_e9sn4j,1576257666.0,"I haven't seen the video. I wanted to ask, what causes young people to be violent towards one another?    

 What are the circumstances that lead to this?    

 Furthermore, if violence is present in a community, does it not make sense that art created from within that space could reflect violence?      

Why, then, are these young people being further punished for the already life-defining burdens of their circumstance???? The attitude of the police, in wanting their lives to be uncomfortable, is not only wrong - It is barbaric.  

This is a blanket approach of punishment to a group of artists who have not all been proven guilty. Everyone associated is tainted with this brush, including their manager. 
It serves no purpose towards rehabilitation and positive social enagagement. In fact, the opposite, as I would argue channeling time into music is more productive and socially condusive than your traditional ""violent gang"" activities. 

Rap has had a history in western sydney that goes back [more than 20 years](https://youtu.be/0MoATM4bT4s). It has been an accessible creative outlet for marginalised and disenfranchised  people throughout history. It is the cultural legacy of the western sydney music community. It's wrong for the police to censor this. Their misuse of terrorism laws means they end up the terrorists. 

OneFour's music makes me hopeful we can continue to use art and creative expression to share ideas, experiences and change the world for the better. Their legacy works towards empowerment & translating energy into something productive. 

This action by NSW police only works towards fueling the sentiments of violent unrest and oppression within an already violent and marginalised community. The abuse of power by police results in them becoming the terrorists. Setting a precedent for encroaching on creative freedom in music under the guise of protecting public safety. Scary times.

Artful expression & creative innovation are what will save us - imo.

TLDR: Violence not good but why violence? Music is poetic artful expression. By policing music performance they neglect the underlying conditions which cause violence in the first place & rob young people of an IRL vision of their own artistic potential - one which can work towards creating positive social change."

aspergers,fae2e49,t1_fadpwy7,1575992208.0,"I appreciate this discussion. Good question u/TheStumblingWolf.  


I think for me, wanting a label is about validation. It's also about knowing that there is a reason I find people/existence difficult and anxiety inducing. I want to know I'm not broken just because I'm different. I too, have always felt like an alien.  


I'm still in the process of getting diagnosis confirmed, about halfway through the test & it's been suggested ADD/Aspergers. I don't trust my ability to self-diagnose either.

I tried accessing a psychologist but the experience was not good, so far psychiatrist has been 100% more useful. I was anxious about the test but in reality it felt like immediate, tangible progress. All of my quirks seem slightly more understandable.

At this point it's hard to image making the kind of progress suggested by OP. I love hearing this story though, I feel better knowing I can relate & that there are things to work towards.   


Joining this subreddit has been really good, there is a solid tribe of unique, authentic people here. I really appreciate it. Thanks everyone!"
australia,fade3ka,t1_facnnlz,1575966644.0,"It's taken me some time to adjust... At first I thought it can't be that bad to breathe outside air. What a weird concept. Then my cat got an upper respiratory infection, won't go outside. I started to smell smoke in the air. For a while I was using the logic ""the inside air is coming from the air outside anyway..."" - I love having windows open to catch every bit of the usual summer breeze. Then one day it started raining ash. My kitchen window is normally open, but that following morning my washed dishes were covered in black and grey specks. I've started closing all my windows - diligently checking the air quality index to check when it's safe to breathe outside air, open the windows. I've ordered a P2 mask because I walk 1k to get to the bus stop - it's not an idea or even an option anymore, it's a necessity. It's been weeks now waking up to a grey & yellow where blue sky should be. Last night I saw the moon shift from an eerie orange to ominous red - colours I had not seen before. It is very much is starting to feel like the dystopian future sci-fi books warned us about."

 I've heard suggestions people are valuing experiences more and more. E.g. success story of Museum of Ice-cream in US.   
  
Offering unique experiences to consumers is a growth industry. Why destory the value in the original take australia has on this? It was an incredibly innovative space 5 yrs ago - immersive art experiences like nothing else. And so valued by people in our current context.  

So frustrated."
australia,fa9ycse,t1_fa9x3th,1575896635.0,"Lets be clear though, if anyone does make money it is the promoter.* My point is all the highly skilled people who work on the ground - including local performing artists, production crews, installation artists etc - they are not getting an award wage at DIY events. Ticket sales will not cover their cost. We all know this, and we work for love/passion/experience, but theres no finacial sustainability and very little opportunity for career development within this space. It makes me sad.

*note: an international act who has their set fee will get paid."

 What's really sad, though, is that it is (or was) a vibrant creative industry in Australia. A whole sector of our creative community found highly skilled work in producing amazing events.    

 Unfortunately its getting increasingly difficult to continue.    

 Sure, parties will keep happening, but don't expect access to international acts, impressive stages, large-scale art installations or high-production values of any kind. The market for this is extremely limited atm."

I will not wear makeup unless I'm performing or feel I need to conform/impress general public type people. I get anxiety so it helps with confidence.    

 I dont like the feeling of having stuff on my face, though. I have a 15 min, minimal application/effort routine.  


I only wash my air once a month/when it smells bad. Generally I will rinse and use a tiny bit of essential oil, tea tree and lavander are my favs. If I have dandrif I will use shampoo. My hair is a beast, I let it do it's own thing. I get a lot of compliments so that helps offset anxiety around rocking unconventional hair.

I'm trying hard to figure it all out asap so I can pay rent.


Edit: I'm in my 3rd yr of a PhD, it's wild 'cause although high functioning some things have never made sense to me and I need to try really hard. I feel really lucky to have gotten this far being so Incapable at basic things. Hoping psych assesment helps me understand me better."

The sentiment was, as it is above, that sometimes you make concessions around an ideal job to have time and space to follow passions. For me, it's also made me consider that teaching is the most enjoyable and meaningful career I've experienced so far... So if I can I'll do more of that, opportunities are mainly in academia though so kinda lucrative. This question of career is a tricky one, I'm at a point where there's lots of pressure to enter industry and I have no idea where to start. I'm actually seeing a careers advisor tomorrow."

Yesterday I was crushed by it and my anxiety/depression had me bedbound but today i'm working again. When I'm down sometimes that also equals easily triggered which means isolation is more of a stable option. I try to be easy on myself and let all the emotion happen. Sometimes I just need space to have a messy, emotional day of processing. Its so hard though. Anxiety is not an easy thing to manage. There's no days off."
musicians,f7rjk4u,t3_dxfp2q,1573982439.0,Open mic is a good suggestion! I'd also recommend going to small local shows and showing support.

Onset is sudden and I'm not well for a couple of hrs. Started talking to doc about it this year 'cause the physical symptoms are getting worse. I used to think it was food related but now am sure its anxiety. My next step is proper psych assesment 'cause I suspect anxiety/depression is a symptom of other stuff, e.g. maybe ADD & PTSD. It's a process. Good on you for being proactive and seeking support."

They do offer some good nuggets, and it has been helpful to vent when things get too much. I get the impression it's best when you find a therapist you 'click' with, though. I haven't found that yet. My next step is psych assesment for proper disagnosis then look for someone who specalises in what I have. I feel like my lack of success is because I've been taking shots in the dark with the councilors I've seen so far. I want a tailored approch rather than generic talk therapy. Thats where I'm at.

I also don't like the idea the two forms have to compete. Bands need transition time regardless. Putting a dj on in that time is clever in my oppinion, keeps vibe going and maxmises production value. If dj is really good they will curate around the bands. It means punters have the best time possible and there is space to appreciate all the artforms. I'm a fan."

Disagreements with sensationalism aside, they speak to current stats around treatement of young, elderly, disabled, as well as domestic violence sufferers. How a country treats its vulnerable people says a lot. Pretending the problems don't exist makes them worse. In my oppinion, Australia deserves better than what we have with the Scott Morrison government. More truthtelling is a start."

PhD,f6vapts,t1_f6tfbvk,1573181025.0,"Well... My scholarship expired without warning. I had done 1.5yrs of masters then upgraded, so 1.5 yrs was deducted from the 3.5 yrs of funding normally given. Crazy system, no warning. Maybe a reflection of higherups not valuing my research, I'm not sure, I don't have the capacity to follow that up. Makes me anxious thinking about it. I was just super lucky to be starting my first semester of teaching so that has gotten me through the last six months. Only full time students recieve scholarship funding in Oz, in my experience. As I haven't been recieving it this semester it made more sense to drop down to part time, set back my finish date and work while I finish the thesis over the next 12 months. I love teaching and I have more work lined up next semester. We are on break now though so have 3 months of unemployment to figure out. Honestly, its an epic distraction. I had my second psych appointment lined up for yesterday (starting process of getting extra support) and they cancelled with no new apps avail til next yr. I cried through the meeting I had with my supervisors yesterday because they want to see writing and I want to know how I pay rent for the next 3 months. Anyway, they have suggested weekly meetings to provide support in working on the phd through general life chaos. Very supportive. I also have a one off psych appointment this arv, so doing what I can. As I said, it's life stress that gets me. My research work is really well recieved though, so the general vibe is I just need to get through the next 3 months, then i am on track to get more teaching experience, finish phd, get my Dr title etc. Its really hard at the moment but I love my research and I'm looking forward to when it's all done. Just have to keep pushing, which is difficult when zero spoons are left. I think thats why the support is so important. Let me know if you have any other questions, also happy to chat via pm."

PhD is full on so I dont have much capacity for dealing with curve balls e.g breakups or moving house or loosing funding. This yr it has been a bit much. That being said, I've dropped down to part time and am in full communication with my supervisors around mental health struggles. If you have finances sorted it is really great, that is a huge load off. Super cool opportunity. Dispite setbacks I'm sure I'll finish. The scholarship allowed me to get all the research done on my terms so, while things may be hard atm, I have faith in myself to get the writing done. The research is what drives it so if you have that down thats a big help. Remember theres options and support available. Wishing you all the best in whatever you choose to do."
