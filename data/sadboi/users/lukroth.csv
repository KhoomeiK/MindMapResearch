Amsterdam,fhhncfk,t1_fhhmyht,1581607938.0,"if you stop paying, the bank will want to sell the apartment to recoup their investment. Getting the tenant out will take time. During this period the bank will have a hard time selling the apartment because no one will buy a flat with a tenant inside who is not paying. So throughout the period (can be months) where the court starts the eviction process of the tenant the bank will be sitting on this asset and not making money off it. This is what they want to prevent."
Amsterdam,fhhmo20,t1_fhhm7ic,1581607548.0,"Good question. I am not sure either. 
Here is my explanation:

Because most people take out a 100% mortgage and have therefore no stake in the apartment. 
once rented out you may shift your responsibility to pay the mortgage to the tenant who has to pay you rent. If the tenant stops paying you, you stop paying the bank. It is very difficult to force out a tenant. Hence the whole thing is a risk management game for the bank."

Let's say I have a stock trading application.

At the same time, this core service is connected to an external broker that receives buy and sell orders from the trading core service. 

The users consume the market data via the FE and submit their buy or sell orders also via the FE. 

Let's say I am in charge of the core trading service on the BE. How would you make the translation form the FE to the BE in order to derive BE relevant customer-centric measurements to make sure that you improve the trading engine with the customer in mind?

The measurements would be centered around the response time of the three APIs:

1. API that communicated between FE and BE.
2. API that communicated between core trading service and real-time market data provider.
3. API that communicated between core trading service and the external broker.
