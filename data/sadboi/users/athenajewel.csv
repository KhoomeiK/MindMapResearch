GERD,foinozb,t3_g7j9t9,1587791441.0,"I have anxiety around medical procedures too. The barium swallow was not as bad as I thought it would be. They gave me some crystals (like pop rocks) that you swallow with a tiny bit of water. That created a HUGE amount of pressure/gas in my chest, but was only super uncomfortable, not unbearable. Then they gave me a cup of the thick barium stuff to drink. I drank as much as I could, but couldn't finish it because it was pretty gross. I didn't throw up from it though, so that was a relief. Then they took the x-rays and I was done. It's pretty quick. I didn't have a good experience with my endoscopy, but it was my doctor's fault. You can probably the find the post I did about it from back in early March, but I don't want to discourage you or scare you. You're going to be anxious and scared, but you will get through it."

AskVet,foex3fj,t3_g6u8ej,1587717844.0,"Not a vet. 
I worked in animal rescue for a while and I’d advise against taking the puppy early. Eliminating 1 puppy out of the equation still leaves 10, which is still a lot, so I wouldn’t risk it just for that. Maybe you could offer to help take care of the puppies at the home so that your brother and his wife can focus on their baby and you can get some extra time with the puppy you’re taking home."
