it does raise a lot more questions then answers if people can be yorishiro's but, does that really mean their people or is this chick like some imagined thing like Misaki. Who knows"
hanakokun,fr6azb7,t1_fr69qrc,1589923022.0,"I was using the Mokke as a figurehead example. Yes the other wonders call Hanako a wonder still and I'm not saying he isn't I'm merely speculating as all theories do. But even with that after the wonders gave up their yorishiro's they're still called the wonders, but they aren't in control of their boundry, And we haven't really seen a boundry for Hanako like we have the others. What I was saying is Pre-Nene going to him Hanako was already trying to figure out who the mole was we know that. But what if he destroyed his own yorishiro (or someone else did) and that's why we haven't seen any of it, and how he could maybe later on in the series make a new one if he doesn't at this time have one.

I hope that made some more since."

No it's not your fault, and it's not selfish to be scared or want to ask for help actually you seem very brave in seeing the bad situation and wanting to change it and if you wanna be girly then screw her, she sounds like a ----- and if she's that mean what does it matter what she thinks.

As someone who has let fear control them a lot (and still controls them some) it's a constant battle of being afraid of not doing the right thing, and little catchphrases like "" don't know until you try"" don't actually help.

what I can say is just, take small steps, if people ask your opinion on something answer it in a small way. Nothing is instant so expecting yourself to change automatically is something that could hurt you worse.

MyLittleSupportGroup,fqs0lvz,t3_gk7nuj,1589595916.0,"I'm not going to say I understand how you feel, because everyone feels differently but in my life I've gone through similar things. The best thing I can say would be this.

Your friends leaving for college or the military is kinda like this quarantine everyone is in, just because you can't always be there doesn't mean they aren't there at all. Think of life like a tree, some people branch off in different directions but that doesn't mean you're not still connected, and it doesn't mean they're gone forever. It just leads possibilities to meet new branches. 2 years ago did you think you'd have the friends you have now? Think of what 2 years from now will be like.

The problem with your parents I kinda understand also, my older sister was a complete screw up and with her being so bad to my family I felt as though I had to be perfect to make up for her crap. You don't need to be smart to be an awesome person, and seeing that people degrade people for not being societies stupid standard of normal or successful is completely trash!! I'm not gonna say ""don't listen to what they say"" because that's crap, and what people still say hurts, but if it's an opinion that hurts, then just blow it off as best as you can.

With your school, I'm quite very sorry, that sounds like it absolutely sucks, but like I said before, maybe this is when you will meet new branches and be a beautiful wood that no one could of imagined!!
