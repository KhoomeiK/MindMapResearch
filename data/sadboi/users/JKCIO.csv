AskReddit,fqhyb4u,t1_fqfghc4,1589386699.0,"Which is really shitty of people tbh. I‚Äôve been playing for almost 20 years now and LOVE when people tell me they‚Äôre trying to learn so I give the best tips I can. I learned to play by using easy tabs (smoke on the water, smells like teen spirit, wonderwall, and so on) and then progressed past that. 

When I started I would play just the root note until I got comfortable and started playing chords and then I started learning to play songs by ear. I didn‚Äôt start really learning theory until I got a little older and took some classes in college for theory and music history. 

I‚Äôm now 34 and picking theory back up to help with producing better. Knowing basic scales can go a long way with writing tbh.

If anyone has someone tell you it‚Äôs too hard and/or you can‚Äôt do it then prove them wrong. It‚Äôs not easy at first and your fingers will hurt but just stick with it. Start out with maybe 30 minutes to an hour a day and build up until it doesn‚Äôt bother you as much. Learn some basic songs and educate yourself with some basic theory to help you with writing and playing. 

Good luck guys and girls!"

I also found a used audio technica es935 on eBay for $25.00 lol. It didn‚Äôt have the mic so found this one and jumped. They‚Äôre still like $50 and higher on reverb and guitar center used.

I‚Äôve played guitar for and been a vocalist for about 2 decades and have done music production since 2011 but never owned a synth. I was going to get a minibrute but stopped by a pawn shop and saw the mininova that had a broken key. I also saw a Focusrite solo I wanted and had planned on an m-audio mtrack 2x2 BUT was able to get both for $250!

I took the synth home and used superglue and fixed the key in 10 minutes and it feels brand new. The mininova is a really fun synth but has taken a little time to get use to because it involves some menu diving but it‚Äôs not too bad. I also downloaded some patches because the stock ones aren‚Äôt the greatest. I haven‚Äôt tried the vocoder yet because it didn‚Äôt come with one but I‚Äôve got an audio technica one on the way.

I have multiple midi boards and an mpc studio black that I use in logic and the mpc software but I‚Äôve always wanted a synth and was going to get a used minibrute but found this locally so I nabbed it at that price.

You‚Äôre going to love this synth but I‚Äôll say the stock presets aren‚Äôt great BUT you can get soundbanks that are much better.
