You have substance induced anxiety disorder man, I‚Äôm sorry to say. It happened to me too. I‚Äôm 4 years clean and it has still messed my life up horribly, but life is a million times better now than it was at the start. Booze and nicotine are my only vices now, alcohol is the only thing that makes it go away. Life was too good before this happened and it‚Äôs a blessing in disguise until the damage has already been done. I‚Äôd suggest stopping use because it‚Äôs never going to get better unless you make some big lifestyle changes. I‚Äôm two weeks sober from alcohol for the first time in years and I feel great and symptoms are at an all time low since it happened, but it still affects my mood on some days. I wish you the best, PM me if you have any questions.

For what it‚Äôs worth, it took me a looooooooong time to get to this point. Don‚Äôt give up and let what happens happen if and when you stop taking it. I had to throw myself in the weeds for years with full on derealization and a chance of panicking any moment for years before it went away.

EDIT: I feel like it‚Äôs important to mention that I do live a totally normal life now, and for the most part my symptoms are in complete remission. The only thing that sucks is that my tolerance for any discomfort or anxious feelings is way worse than it ever was before this happened. I don‚Äôt have any panic attacks at all and never worry about them at all, I barely think about this stuff anymore unless I‚Äôm having a particularly bad day, but even then something usually happens and turns my mood around and the next day always turns out much better. I travel alone and enjoy it, I sleep completely normally, I have two jobs and I‚Äôm making music again. The only thing I‚Äôm missing is a relationship which I‚Äôm just hoping doesn‚Äôt bring me back down like my last one did.
