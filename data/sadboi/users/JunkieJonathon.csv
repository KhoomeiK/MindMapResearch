ColdWaterExtraction,fpg8qtq,t1_fpf9801,1588597293.0,"Realistically you want 2mg of codeine per ml of water so you‚Äôre right on that. You should only take maximum 300mg of codeine so the max water you need is 600ml. Now the Prometh should be half the dose if codeine. For example 150 mg of codeine with 75mg of prometh. 

Codeine has a ceiling affect. It‚Äôs stops converting to morphine after 400mg. Codeine is the weakest opiate so if you desire the effects of oxycodone then codeine might not work for you. Ok so 300mg if codeine converts to 45mg of morphine in your liver.
