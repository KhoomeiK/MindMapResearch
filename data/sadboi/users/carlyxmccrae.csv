askatherapist,fpe0ydj,t3_gcuvtk,1588538177.0,"I‚Äôm not a therapist, just someone who‚Äôs gone through the same thing. I was arrested a year ago, and it wasn‚Äôt until just recently I got over the fear of police. I would physically shake, my breathing would become shallow, I would cry, and eventually have to pull over every time I even saw a cop car. I understand how frustrating it is. I felt like it would never get better. I believe my fears subsided due to exposure, as another redditor commented. I stopped living in fear, and started putting myself into uncomfortable situations. I stopped pulling over when police were behind me. I stopped taking back roads. I faced my fear and all the things that made me uncomfortable, and after so many times, I realized that it was all in my head, and in reality, things were ok! I would suggest MAKING yourself uncomfortable, not avoiding it or shying away from it. Hope this helps a bit, and I wish you peace, friend! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

askatherapist,f8snpd2,t3_e1zvnk,1574785056.0,"Hey man, you remind me a lot of myself. I‚Äôm not a therapist but am 19 years old and have been seeing one since I was 13. I truly can‚Äôt express to you just how much therapy has changed and shaped my life for the better. I genuinely think it‚Äôs saved my life. I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that people seem to be minimizing your problems and that you‚Äôve been dealing with some shitty stuff. The only advice I can give to you is to talk to someone (a therapist) about how you are feeling. They can give so much insight and help you recognize what your feelings and emotions are, and how they connect to other parts of your life. Something that helped me before therapy was journaling. Sounds corny, but really helpful. It‚Äôs very cathartic to write and write and write about a shitty day or a shitty person until you can‚Äôt anymore. Writing things down also helps with rationalizing thoughts. Furthermore, I want you to recognize that you have been through some TRAUMA. Bullying that has obviously scarred you and relationships that have ended badly are huge pieces of trauma, whether some people believe it or not, and you deserve to deal with it in a healthy way. Therapists can help you see things realistically, and most importantly, help you learn to cope with your emotions. The absolute greatest thing that ever happened to me. It is great that you are reaching out on here ‚Äî it means you are seriously feeling down and need some help. I strongly encourage you to look into therapists in your area. Can‚Äôt stress enough how mine has saved my life. I wish you luck and hope there‚Äôs better days ahead :)"

Secondly, this situation is all too familiar with my own mother. I‚Äôve been in therapy for 5 years now, and the best advice I‚Äôve ever gotten is you can‚Äôt control what they do, you can only control how you react. Unfortunately, it has come to a point where your mother is just not changing. If she‚Äôs been this way for as long as you can remember, it‚Äôs truly who she is deep in her core. Some things just can‚Äôt be changed no matter how much they suck, and the sooner you come to terms with that instead of fighting for what you believe is right, it gets a lot easier. Sure, it isn‚Äôt fair, but that mindset can help you. That being said, it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre stuck. It doesn‚Äôt mean your life will be like this forever. You‚Äôre one year (probably only a couple months now) to being an adult. I know it‚Äôs easier said than done, but once you‚Äôre legally an adult and not technically under her care anymore, you truly can do whatever you want with your life, no holds barred. As for the college situation, maybe you could find a family member who is willing to help you navigate financial aid, or even co-sign off on a loan for you. Nothing is impossible for you, no matter how hard it seems. There‚Äôs plenty of options for people just like you. And quite frankly, people who have it worse than you have completed these feats too! Most importantly, take care of yourself and your mental health. An absent or lacking mother can be quite damaging to the psyche. Make sure you‚Äôre ok, and don‚Äôt be afraid to reach out for help. Even if it‚Äôs on a community like this, there‚Äôs always someone willing to help. Therapy has worked wonders for me. I wish you the best, and really hope you get to go to Cali!!!"

Veterans,ep5go5k,t3_btyh0m,1559055655.0,"When someone you love goes into treatment is a very frustrating time. You have to separate your love and feelings for them with what is best for them. Your husband may love to see you, and tell you he wants to see you, but sometimes it may not be best, as it may make him feel lonely in treatment or miss home. Removing himself from ‚Äúlife‚Äù and checking himself into a controlled environment means that he knows he needs help with making decisions, so even though he says he wants to see you, mentally, maybe it‚Äôs not the best. I‚Äôm NOT saying going to see him is automatically a bad thing, but it is definitely something that should be talked about with the therapist because in reality they are the one who really KNOWS what is best for your husband. 
In treatment, I personally think no decisions should be made individually. It is truly the only time the patient should not be in control. That‚Äôs why they are there. 
When I was in treatment, all I wanted to do was see my mom and go home. Everyday I wanted her to come. But in reality, treatment is the ONLY time you are allowed (and should) to completely isolate yourself and only worry about yourself. My therapist knew seeing my mom distracted me from my progress and made me feel sad. Instead of getting determined to get better and get the hell out so I could go home, it turned into me figuring out how to cheat the system and go home. 
For someone who has no experience with this, it‚Äôs probably really hard for you and feels confusing. But him going into treatment is the start of an amazing chapter of his and your life. I hope he gets well and I wish you the best!"
