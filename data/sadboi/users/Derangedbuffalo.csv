I kept over thinking way too much. I had the same issue with being unable to finger myself and was freaking out more so.

My advice would be lube and lots of it. First time I didn't use any and it was uncomfortable. Not painful but not really pleasurable. The second time to just kind of relax me more, we used lube and it was fantastic. I was so much more relaxed not having to worry about the whole uncomfortable or not fitting thing. After that my confidence grew and I no longer needed lube!

All I'd say is don't worry that you're still a virgin, I hadn't done anything sexual at this age and I'm now actually glad I hadn't, because I know for sure I would have made a lot of silly decisions had I decided to lose my virginity earlier!"

So about 2 weeks ago, I had a odd couple of days where I had no energy, I felt awful and drained and could barely move off the sofa (I am usually a very energetic person who can't stand to see their house a mess, but I couldn't care less about the housework at this point). After a few days, the same thing happened again. Awful fatigue, dizziness etc.

Fast forward to last weekend and I woke up with the worst sore throat out of nowhere. I saw white spots on my tonsils so thought tonsillitis. I was put on antibiotics but had a bad reaction and had to come off them after just 3 days. A cough started on day 2, but you sometimes get that with tonsillitis too. I feel recovered from that mostly, but the fatigue has crept back, my throat is sore again and this time I have headaches, congestion, dizziness, aches and pains. 

I'm starting to wonder is this is more than I first thought as my son has had similar symptoms, as has my partner."

This got worse when I developed a cough and now I am very congested so of course my chest gets a little tight every now and then. I haven't had a temperature.

I had a terrible reaction to my antibiotics, they caused severe diarrhoea (I had to stop them) and then led to dehydration so headaches and dizziness and nausea. My brain is now going into overdrive and I'm so panicky.

I can't stop thinking what if, what if  what if. I keep seeing posts on Facebook about it, threads of people discussing symptoms or people who have had it or died.

Anxiety,fj4ae13,t3_fbguh6,1583003822.0,What is propranolol supposed to do to sexual performance? Currently taking this and I'd be interested to know!
Anxiety,fj4abxp,t3_fbgz8c,1583003786.0,"I spent so many years fighting them, and realised that it's actually better to just kind of accept it almost? Like try and think ""it's only a panic attack, it won't last forever, I know it's uncomfortable but I can get through this and it'll be okay""

Mine have started to paralyse me, I feel like my body is full of lead and I'm too weak to move. I literally lay there shivering and crying and it's absolutely awful. I can't talk, I can't almost bring myself to make my voice work."
Anxiety,fj4a2ru,t3_fb9izy,1583003626.0,"Honestly doing even the smallest of things when riddled with anxiety is so challenging, you are awesome to push through that and it shows just how much inner strength you have!"
Anxiety,fj49yyz,t3_fbbhhe,1583003560.0,"I get this. I'll have those hours or sometimes rarely even a day with no anxiety and I feel great, just going about my life not over thinking everything. And then I suddenly have a thought like ""why couldn't I just be like this all the time? Why do I have to be difficult. I just want to do normal things without making myself ill"" and I get really just... Heartbroken? It breaks me that I can't just be normal"
Anxiety,fj49sup,t3_fbe006,1583003453.0,"I feel like I switch between the two. Some days I love nothing more than social interaction, I feel so energized almost, by just talking to people etc. Other times I'm just like please nobody even look at me and I will try to avoid leaving the house as much as possible."
Anxiety,fj49o81,t3_faz1uo,1583003375.0,"I am exactly the same. Even if I have a phone call set for a week away, I will be full of dread all the way up until that moment. The anxiety symptoms either build and build until they completely explode the day before or after it has finished. It drives me insane"
Anxiety,fj49izc,t3_fbbp70,1583003288.0,"Yessss. Always to the point where they bleed too and someone will point it out and I'm just thinking ""I can't help it leave me alone"""
Anxiety,fj49g05,t1_fj2h5yx,1583003236.0,Hey don't be silly! Life gets busy sometimes and that's completely fine!
weddingshaming,fiq8pdu,t1_fip3gdt,1582638332.0,"That's the thing she has two girls, she's just never breastfed or been that kind of mother that keeps her babies close. So she can't understand my parenting and the fact that my son comes first, always! It created a lot of unnecessary arguments and drama, but I am so glad that is out the way with!"
Anxiety,fidvoae,t3_f7pf6k,1582371932.0,"Change I have found is my biggest challenge when it comes to anxiety. I'm trying to break routine but it's so hard! Just remember, that everything new soon becomes familiar, and you will find your rhythm and settle in well!"
Anxiety,fid97ez,t1_fiak3fw,1582364296.0,"This happened to me. No panic attacks for over a year. Then a manager at work belittled me so much, it reminded me of how cruel my mum used to be when I was a kid, making me feel like a piece of shit and I think it all came flooding back as since around that time it was panic attacks daily, couldn't work etc. Even now thinking about it I'm starting to feel anxious. I really hope things start to get better for you!"
Anxiety,fid8y6a,t1_fi9qk4u,1582364183.0,"I hope you are able to fall asleep, sleep is the best healer"
Anxiety,fid8wcj,t1_fi9cxp7,1582364160.0,"I had 7 months at one point, with only small anxiety during that time, and then was hit with it worse than ever before. Panic attacks multiple times a day etc and I have no idea what happened. It sucks so much!"
Anxiety,fid8s96,t1_fi9c6zw,1582364112.0,"I hope tomorrow is better for you! Try keep your head up and remember feeling okay, even though its difficult. You got this!"
Anxiety,fid8pih,t1_fi99rle,1582364076.0,"Thank you so much. It really is disheartening. I've pulled through it before, so I know I can again. Just wish this damn cycle would end!"
Anxiety,fid8mxv,t1_fi994zu,1582364041.0,Me too. I have ibs d and guess what my biggest fear is? Diarrhea in public. So any hint of stomach uneasiness and that's game over for me. Stops me doing so much and I hate it!
Anxiety,fid8iz5,t1_fi9tzx2,1582363988.0,Yeah I made this mistake just after high-school and ended up barely leaving my parents house for 2 years. I wasted so much of my life and regret it so much. I just wish I had gotten the proper help instead of burying my head in the sand!
Anxiety,fid8f0f,t1_fi9025h,1582363936.0,"Omg are you me!? I had the EXACT same thing happen, except it was the end of November. I was doing so well, I'd been in a job for about 7 months, felt fantastic and out of nowhere at work I had the worst panic attack of my life. It was horrendous. My biggest fear, ibs in public and I was just a complete mess. It knocked my confidence completely, I couldn't even think about work without a panic attack. I'm still trying to recover from it and it's been slow, but I think things are slowly starting to pick up"
Anxiety,fid863f,t1_fi8zy3b,1582363831.0,"Going to sound weird, but honestly just not trying to fight it. I spent so many years trying to stop it, make it better and just ended up stressing myself out so much more. Now I just kinda ride along with it, try to remind myself that tomorrow might be better, and try to remind myself that it could be a lot worse. But that it's also okay to have bad days."
