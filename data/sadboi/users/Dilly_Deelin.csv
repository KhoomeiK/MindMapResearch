WritingPrompts,flo7com,t3_fpvkww,1585332946.0,"*Stay inside! Somebody loves you*, the ad read. It was the third time Sarah had seen a Coronavirus warning. Guess the government's really cracking down on quarantine, although this particular ad annoyed her. She closed it out.

It was almost 11—time to meet with her product manager. She opened a videoconference and saw him sitting in his office. 

""Good morning, Ted. How ya holding up over there?""

""Hey Sarah, fine I guess. Kinda sick of my place, but at least I'm healthy."" Sarah's web browser icon flashed up in the toolbar. She clicked it. Just a new ad in the same spot. This time, for the very product Sarah was developing. 

""That's good, Ted."" 

*Finally, ads that just get you*, it read. ""Ha. I just got an ad for DANN over here."" 

Direct Advertising Neural Network, their latest product, was slated to be one of the biggest advances in online marketing. Using unprecedented access to each person's internet activity, DANN could pull from a variety of emotionally targeted ad campaigns to tailor the perfect effect for a given user. 

""An ad for DANN? That's weird. I thought we weren't rolling it out yet. How's that going, by the way? I saw you made that new script live. Seen any new results?""

""Not yet. Actually, I have noticed that the ads I'm getting are weirdly sentimental."" 

""I... guess that's a good sign?"" Sarah's taskbar flashed up again.

""Watch this, Ted, it's doing it right now. I'll share my screen."" He watched as Sarah opened her browser again.

""So it always flashes up like that?"" Ted asked. ""Like a page notification?""

""At least this morning, yeah."" *Affordable Wines for Us to Share*, the ad read.

""See that, Ted?"" Sarah said. ""I don't even drink."" 

Ted laughed. ""That 'us' looks like DANN's got a crush on you.""

""You joke, Ted, but each ad I've gotten since adding the new script involved a personal appeal. A sort of... longing. Is that what our ad team's been writing?""

""I can check in with them, but I don't think so. In the meantime, we should probably remove that script and work on it some more.""

Sarah looked at her browser again. Even with an ad blocker on, she still saw flashing corners of her screen with messages like *Ice Cream & Theatre: A Match Made in Heaven*, *Your Soul Mate Is Just a Click Away*, and *DANN is your man... well, if DANN were human*.

The ads weren't just abundant, they were irrelevant. Maybe it was time for a refresher on coding. As she went to close the browser, another message popped up.

*Please, don't leave. You're everything I dream of.*

Sarah stared for about a minute before closing out the browser window. After she removed the script, she hit CTRL+S. Nothing happened. No save progress bar, nothing. 

Only after the fourth try did her mouse successfully click Save."

Good thing we had Joe admit that he was in favor of reducing/freezing benefits (not a necessary distinction since both result in less income).

You obviously weren't paying attention to the insane voter suppression, the DNC rigging rules to allow for shitholes like Bloomberg to take the stage, Mayor Pete's magic connections to a voting company, and the staggering discrepancies in Bernie's exit polls. Fuck off, you fucking fuck face. 

This was always an uphill battle because Biden likes jacking off his donors while keeping up that plastic smile. For most of us, Bernie was the first politician who wouldn't. The tragedy is not that Bernie lost (though it is absolutely tragic) -- the tragedy is that people willfully fought against their own interests for the second election in a row. 

And morons like you think that's a gotcha somehow. Walk your pompous, sweater vested ass into oncoming traffic."
