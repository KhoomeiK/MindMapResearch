helpme,flulgoc,t1_fltzmp7,1585504992.0,"If there is any meaning, we can't help you with that. Dreams do not have a global meaning, they correlate with emotions you've experienced and emotions you may feel in the future. We don't feel for you and we don't live for you either, so we cannot be sure about what this could mean, only yourself. Try having a notebook where you can write down your dreams, so you can trace and remember them better; I have one. Also, don't try to give them meaning by force. If it doesn't hit you after a while, it won't happen."
ambientmusic,fknxljw,t1_fkn3649,1584375994.0,"Sure! I really like ""The Empty Follow Unholds"" by Raison D'être and I usually tend to recommend it to my friends who are into ambient. ""Morals and Dogma"" by Deathprod is a nice one too, and is a lot more immersive in my opinion. If you are into more melodic stuff, I suggest you to listen to Deru's ""1979"". It is quite a deppresive-nostalgic experience, and I'm in love with it. ""Torn in Two"" by Deru is a great more-noisy option as well! If you haven't listened to Lawrence English ""Cruel Optimism"", I suggest you to give it a listen. He also made a record with William Basinski called ""Selva Oscura"", but is a lot more charming. Another of my favorite titles this year are ""22° Lunar Halo"", ""Variations on Darkness"" (both by Sigur Rós), ""Mørkt Foraar"" (Offermose) and the works of The Caretaker."
ambientmusic,fkn0pul,t3_fjh6d8,1584348086.0,"I don't know if my use is strictly about therapy, but listening to music definitely makes me feel better when I'm having an episode. This may sound cliché, but my favorite album to listen to when I'm too anxious is ""And Their Refinement Of The Decline"", by Stars Of The Lid (anything from their discography, actually). I'm also enjoying a lot the last works of Sigur Rós in Liminal (I, II, III & Sleep [sleep is very ethereal and my favorite]) and their album ""Route One"", but I'm not sure if some other people will find that relaxing as well. Truth is that I'm into the more dark and obscure part of ambient, tho!

You should check out ""A Winged Victory for the Sullen"", by the artist of the same name. I find it actually relaxing and uplifting; really helped me out a few years back. I totally forgot about this album when I started writing. If you want something from this year, you should check out ""Una Presencia En La Brisa"", by the argentinian Leandro Fresco (it may be quite dense). Hope you're doing well, OP!

I, personally, was always amazed emotionally for his decisions, and listening to him really makes me feel some warm on my spine, regardless I'm in a good or bad mood. It really depends on your experiences, not only in music listening or theory, but in life as well, I believe. I don't think it is worth of a debate, tho. He is an artist like every other artist, and some people will feel it, some others won't."
AskReddit,fecz4gq,t3_eodtd1,1578990678.0,"Well, I wasn't there nor knew the man, but a long ago I read about and saw photos of a guy that, in the middle of a breakdown, murdered his wife and later on tried to kill himself. The bullet didn't touch his brain, and he lost a great part of his face. No more sense of sight, smell or taste. Policemen found him walking through the room with his face wide open and completely absorted by his thoughts. It was terrifying to look at.

Edit: typo."

PublicFreakout,f48jqmt,t1_f48fun4,1571440706.0,"It's actually a lot more than only the subway prices. Chile is one of the most inequal countries in proportion of wage, and one of the most expensive as well. We carry a lot from the dictatorship from 40 years ago, and what is happening today is absolute rage because of everything that has happen. That and the violence ejerced by police against our population, especially to highschool students this year (because of the protests)."
AskReddit,f1ai6tj,t3_d84we9,1569294688.0,"Politics and social networks. The whole world is just a constant contradiction between excesive connection and gnawed communication, and everyone just seem so lost and/or confused in the modern world of today. Reality has become so virtual that it shares in itself a sense of ""*being* in absentia"", so social constructions and phenomenons are just a ghost of themselves."
SuicideWatch,f16tnw3,t1_f16a0cj,1569223607.0,"This actually made me cry. Sometimes we just forget that great things aren't done by impulse, but by a series of good things brought together. I try so much to make beautiful things and fail because of effort, stress and dissapointment taking over my life, that i forget to fight against me to develop my own strenghs and find clearance. Truth is that, if we do nothing, if we cease searching, then we are lost. I've been so much time in bed, so many days tired and doing nothing, crying for not living what i wanted to live, that i managed to imprison myself in a great longing of love and action. Today, I wanna give myself a chance and, maybe, stop *wanting* to experience life and just live, for once."

chile,ep0d8zp,t3_btkrnn,1558973924.0,"Estuve toda la noche despierto desarrollando un examen de la U que no pude hacer antes porque me sentía tremendamente ansioso y no podía comenzar a hacer nada. Literalmente estuve todo el día en cama, y comencé a hacerlo a las 00:00 cuando la entrega debía ser a las 8 AM. Logré terminarlo a las 7:20 y lo envié a la misma hora, para luego salir corriendo a tomar la micro e intentar llegar por lo menos media hora tarde a las clases que empezaban a las 8:30. Llego y entregan los resultados de otro examen y me fue terrible. Van dos así. Lo peor es que siquiera me importa tanto, pero estoy feliz de al menos haber podido completar la entrega que era para hoy. Mañana tengo otro examen y no creo estar lo suficientemente preparado para él. Y es mi culpa, y debería hacerme cargo. Aunque, realmente, a estas alturas lo único que me interesa es dormir, y no es sólo porque tenga sueño."
