But I'm gonna be selfish for my sake and hers."
WouldYouRather,fmxd5ll,t1_fmxa32q,1586462780.0,"My choice is definitely selfish and I'm very optimistic when it comes to people and problems we face. World hunger will end, third-world countries will become first-world, and whatever else needs to be done. 

And with this choice, I can change the lives of myself and my loved ones. 

Broadly speaking, I think all of us that live in first-world countries are making the same choice I'm making here. Most of us can easily scale back on our standard of living and donate a large portion of our income and time to helping the needy, but we don't. 

Honestly I'm surprised my answer didn't get downvoted to hell because it is selfish. I'm choosing myself and my family/friends over the hungry."

So what else I do with the money aside from invest and help others in the ways I want to? 

But that's all secondary. I know my choice is selfish, yet... I choose my mama over everything else because she sacrificed for us. With that money, she can retire, do the things she always wanted to do, move to Italy, take Italian lessons, and have her own adventures and contentment. 

Or sit on her butt and watch all her shows and movies lol"

I could've become a multimillionaire and allow her to retire in style, but instead I ended world hunger, something that is the responsibility of nations? 

I'm not very altruistic I guess."
unpopularopinion,fmocv36,t1_fmnkjdd,1586254256.0,"Spoons are superior to forks. The scooping is just too good, can cut as well as a fork, can hold more food per bite, needs less dexterity, and can eat soups and cereals. 

I cut my meat while I prep my plate anyways and don't use a fork unless I have to hold something down to cut or is the obvious choice like if I'm eating pasta or salad and need stabbiness. 

People sleep on the spoon and I'll die on this hill. Downvote me because I'm ready.

Edit: I'll use a fork but not happily"

It makes me think about the bit that said something like: we can be in the atom of a blade of grass on an alien planet or something. We're dealing with magnitudes and infinities beyond what we can understand, let alone what Roland can understand lol. 

I might be completely off on this, but that's how I imagined it. It's like... we are all those old rewritable DVD disks. The tower can rewrite and rewrite and rewrite all it wants. I don't think the tower only changes Roland's disk, but everyone's."

vandwellers,fgosaf1,t1_fgoputi,1580984143.0,"Thanks for your insight! Really puts things into perspective. 

I would like to add something about not making a fuss. I went through the security guard training and understand trespassing laws and such. When I said, ""I won't make a fuss"", I mean, ""I'm not gonna be an asshole and make you feel bad about doing your job"". 

Security guards get A LOT of shit and I always say, ""Hey how you doing sir?"" when I come across one. I respect what they do and try to give them some positive human interaction :) That's all I meant. 

I understand where you're coming from, but I think you need to understand making a fuss just means complaining, which is legal. You can complain while following the law. Not making a fuss means not making the guards life harder than it has to be. 

Challenging authority, giving authority the business - I think that's what made America America, for better or worse. 

I'm sorry you have to deal with all that bullshit. I'm a very agreeable person and can't imagine ever giving a business owner any trouble. I laugh at people who make a fuss because it's ridiculous behavior. But it's not illegal and everyone has a choice to make a fuss over anything, yet I wouldn't want to live in a country where no one has a choice to make a fuss. Would you?"

But really this spot I'm talking about is just nice to have your lunch at, do some work in your car, then leave. It used to be the city's Kmart, but when that closed down, nothing came to replace it. It does attract a lot of homeless, which get pushed off immediately by security, so I assumed this guy was just following orders. 

My usual spot in this city is the library, so I guess I'll be going there again."
