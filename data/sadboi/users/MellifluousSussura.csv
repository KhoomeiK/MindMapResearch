Anxiety,fpp0x18,t3_geiyn7,1588794034.0,"Yeah. Part of the problem is that our brains are very good at patterns of behavior. So at some point we were in a stressful situation, and in classic fight/flight/freeze response we chose flight (or freeze), and it worked! It got us out of that situation!

So obviously our brains were like “well, this worked, let’s apply it to more situations”, and that’s very helpful in some cases! Things like dangerous situations or people that are toxic are good to avoid. But then we start applying it to more and more things, and it becomes a problem. It becomes our go-to solution and it’s very hard to train oneself out of a habit, especially when that habit is actually not doing something.

There’s no real easy solution to this other than taking it day by day, and trying to retrain yourself. It will always be easier to avoid things that you might fail at, but remember that that’s not healthy or good for you. You’re brain is kinda like a misbehaving dog, unfortunately. And retraining it is hard, but it is possible!"

Advice,fomml6d,t3_g86ggv,1587895780.0,"I can’t give you advice about your family, but you may want to limit your contact with news media so that you don’t have to interact with the state of the world as often. Sometimes “ignorance is bliss” translates into “willful ignorance for the moment is better for your mental health”

Do you have anyone you can lean on emotionally? Sometimes just having someone to vent to can help lessen the emotional toll of everything. Also if you have a piece of media or something that you really love or brings you good feelings, don’t hesitate to indulge in it.

Right now your mental health is more important than “staying informed”, don’t feel bad for making decisions that prioritize that!"
Advice,fomm0z4,t3_g86mrx,1587895150.0,"My brother is very much the same way. A lot of the time he just doesn’t think to reply to stuff I send him, unless it’s obv a question I need him to answer. Luckily he has read repceits (that isn’t spelled right sorry) on so I know that he at least is reading what I send him, which is enough of a compromise for me.

That being said it would be a totally different story if it was my boyfriend pulling that crap. Being in a relationship is a choice he made and you’re not something he can neglect without consequences.

On the other hand, does your bf struggle with anxiety or depression (or something like that) at all? I only ask because when my anxiety gets really bad I have a tendency to isolate and not return texts or calls and ignore people. It doesn’t really excuse him, but that would make it more understandable and something he can work on."

Advice,fomkrk9,t3_g8767u,1587893732.0,"I feel like your “rough edges” might actually be more helpful in connecting with possible clients (patients??) than you think. My dad was a doctor (retired now) who dressed and acted in a very “unprofessional” manner and many people actually found that they liked him more than other doctors who were more professional and serious. A lot of people complained about having to go to his partners when he retired because they liked him more! As long as you have the knowledge and will to help people the rest shouldn’t be a problem.

Remember that even if this fails, you already have skills and experience you can fall back on! True that you probably can’t get your job back right away with the pandemic and all, but it won’t last forever! My only concern is that you may not both want to switch what you’re doing at the same time so that one of you has some stability while the other get settled.

Advice,fomjze6,t3_g8a4lm,1587892877.0,"Tbh this probably isn’t something that is specific to your school, several colleges will cover up things like sexual assault and hazing and other things that are awful. I know this is especially prevalent in rich and private colleges as well.

That being said you should certainly exercise some caution! I would consider some things like taking a self defense class, getting some pepper spray just in case. I know there’s a self defense thing you can put on your keychain that looks like an abstract cat face and works kinda like spiked knuckles (google “women’s self defense weapons” for more ideals)

And obviously watch any drinks and don’t let anyone pour you a drink, always pour your own! And be careful who you trust.

Hopefully it’s simply out of a place of concern for your soul (or whatever you believe) and not whatever righteous crap would lead someone to fake being friends with you.

That being said, the best advice I can give if you want to avoid confrontation is to simply stonewall any talks of religion. When he brings it up just be like “that’s nice” and then change the conversation. Just straight up don’t give him any ammunition to continue the conversation down that path. Either he’ll get the hint and let up or he’ll confront you/distance himself which will let you know he wasn’t your friend in the first place."

I was afraid of a lot of things as a kid and eventually I’d just have to deal with it or find a way around it (or give myself ocd but that’s unrelated to this), but I understand there’s no real way for you to do that when you’re not the one with the fear, so I’m not totally sure what other advice might help"

It might be a good idea to keep some record of the things she has done to remind yourself of why you chose to split off away from her.

Also, I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of this thing called love languages? The basic idea behind it is that love and affection can be communicated in different ways, and much like languages or taste what works for one person may not commute to another. The feeling of affection and happiness you’re looking for may not be something you can find in touch, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find it elsewhere!

Advice,fomh0zx,t3_g88x43,1587889711.0,"Remember that the first thing you’ve instinctually thought is usually what you’ve been taught to think, and come up with ways to combat that.

Some things that help are positive thinking, which is obv what it sounds like. If you can’t do that then even just neutral thinking is fine. Things like “my body gets me from place to place” and “my body works and does what it needs to” are still better than negative thoughts!

I know some people will also assign a name or person to their bad thoughts to separate themselves from them and combat them. For instance I’ve heard of one girl who, whenever she has a self deprecating thought, pretends it’s Trump who said it and then she goes “shut up, Trump” (obv insert whoever you don’t like instead idk this isn’t the spot for politics)

And make sure you get a support group! Even just some people online who you can turn to and share your struggles with is better than not having anyone!"
Advice,fomgmmw,t3_g88xzy,1587889292.0,"Maybe ask your therapist for some resources that can help educate your boyfriend.

Sometimes the people that care about us don’t actually know how best to care for us, and even if/when we forgive them for that it doesn’t make it any easier.

You may want to look into stim toys and other things that can be used in place of those urges. I’m not sure what all is out there or if it will help but it can’t hurt to try! If nothing else you can get gloves to wear to stop yourself from scratching.

You may also want to look into getting some medication. It sounds like this interferes with your life often and frequently enough that it is difficult to function normally, which is pretty much what medications were made to help with!"
Advice,fomg8xp,t3_g890bz,1587888903.0,"Depending on what your parents are like (and how big/noticeable the scar is) you might be able to get away with something like “idk where it came from” and just acting really confused. (I have a couple small scars that idk where they actually came from) You could try to act like it was always there and just hope they don’t address it, but it sounds like you don’t think that will work. There might be some water proof something you can cover it with (makeup or body paint?) but that’s kind of a lot of trouble and (at least for makeup) maybe expensive.

There is scar remover cream you can use! It won’t completely get rid of it but it should make it less noticeable.

If you really want you can try the “I tripped and it wasn’t that big of a deal at the time” sort of thing? Like you weren’t actively trying to hide anything it just wasn’t a big enough deal to bother anyone with.

You may eventually just have to come clean in the end tbh, but once you’ve done that it’s finished and you won’t have to worry about it anymore!"

Advice,fomf0hq,t3_g87wpw,1587887636.0,"If she is at risk then I would definitely advise wearing a mask! However that doesn’t mean all affection has to be tabled!

If you move your shower time to after you get home from work you might be able to be close then? (You’d probably still have to wear a mask, and def you should change clothes, also I’m not a doctor)

These times really suck in terms of wanting to be close to people when you can’t be, but it’s worth the sacrifice to make sure our loved ones stay safe! But there are still ways for contact if you need it that shouldn’t put her at excess risk. I hope you both stay healthy and safe!"

Like don’t ease-drop but be physically there and pay attention to what they’re saying. Then when there’s a bit of a lull try adding something to the convo.

I know that was pretty vague, but this is one of those things that takes practice more than anything to get the hang of, unfortunately.

It also helps to look positive and interested in what other people are saying, even if you’re feeling excluded and like you can’t take part in the conversation. That’s more of just a psychological/body language thing I have heard around than something I have tried enough to confirm though."

Advice,fomdl58,t3_g87lyk,1587886208.0,"These are very valid concerns to have! Music is wonderful but I do know the field is very competitive no matter what you do with it. If you really feel passionate about music I would definitely try to go for that in your future, but make sure to have a backup plan! Have maybe a list of things you’re good (or at least decent) at that you can pursue as a main career if music doesn’t work out. Remember you can always pursue music as a hobby or on your own even if you don’t end up working in it!

I do want to ask, though: are you planning on getting a higher education? If you are then that gives you some extra time to find what you want to do with your life and what you think will work. It is also a great place to form connections and “network”, which can be very helpful when looking for jobs!"
