bipolar,es83pc6,t1_es83nh8,1561687129.0,Is that an anxiety med?
bipolar,es83o29,t3_c6778c,1561687104.0,Really good drawing!
bipolar,es83iil,t1_es83fjs,1561686998.0,Same! I keep walking into things by accident :/ I posted the other day how I felt like I was on the right med combo but now I'm not so sure :(
bipolar,es83d27,t1_es83bp8,1561686893.0,"Like, physically or mentally?"
bipolar,es4vd1b,t1_es4v6sj,1561594890.0,"It sucks that I broke someone's trust and I barely even remember it. I ruined the best thing in my life while completely manic and not functional. I'm torn between taking complete accountability, berating and hating myself, and blaming bipolar."
bipolar,es4uput,t3_c5uhkl,1561594408.0,This is amazing!
bipolar,es4uh9o,t1_es4ueuf,1561594229.0,"Thanks. But how can I help him believe that won't happen, and how can I trust that I won't do something that stupid while manic again?"
BipolarReddit,es0al2i,t3_c51i02,1561470559.0,"Yeah. The first time I was manic I told multiple people that I was in love with some of my best friends, and told multiple others that everyone I knew including my ex was either addicted to drugs or dying of an overdose. The most recent time I was manic, I checked myself into a hospital but my mom wouldn't give my boyfriend any info and I was certainly in no state to, and then I came out of the hospital so manic that I had vivid hallucinations of him murdering me, so I dumped him over text cause I was scared to see him. Now we're back together but his family is pissed at me for not keeping him in the loop in the hospital and for the way we broke up, and my family is pissed at him for the things I said about him when I was manic. So it's gonna be a bumpy road back. I have to say the hardest part is the lack of empathy. Nobody really seems to care that I was delusional. All they care about is what I did. Someone told me I'm still accountable for everything I do, even while manic. I'm trying to wrap my head around that."
bipolar,eryjjf1,t3_c4m6it,1561409976.0,"I'm loving my combo but for some reason I'm exhausted during the days even when I get a normal sleep. I can't tell if it's from the Zoloft (12.5mg, on it for 2.5 weeks) or the Klonopin (2mg per day, 1 of which is in the morning, on it for a month). I can't wait until hopefully this feeling passes!"
ptsd,ery734w,t3_c4l49v,1561401911.0,Yeah when I get overwhelmed or triggered I start punching myself in the face. It's to try to get the stress out. I'm trying hard to stop.
zoloft,ery6z7t,t3_c4p3fw,1561401838.0,"I've been on Zoloft for nearly 3 weeks (very low dose of 12.5mg) and I feel incredible so far. I don't feel like a robot, I still do feel sad when the situation warrants it, but overall I just feel so much better! I really like this medication and I still completely feel like myself, just less sad."
BPD,ery6jsl,t3_c4ndpc,1561401559.0,"You are being so mindful and practicing opposite to emotion action! I am so proud of you, I know how hard that can be!"
BipolarReddit,ery6fas,t3_c4rl2l,1561401479.0,"I'm right there with you. What's helping me is dividing my time between recharging and healing, and getting important things done. I spend my Monday and Friday mornings just listening to music, laying in bed, and relaxing, then I work on tasks, then I relax again. My secret to productivity is lists. It gives me such a self esteem boost to check tasks off a list, and it also helps me remember everything I have to do. The morning relaxation gives me the energy to spend afternoons tackling things on my list one at a time. Many weeks I don't finish my list and that's okay! I'm just a human whose healing and there are some days I get nothing done at all. But I get my motivation ultimately from knowing that I have time to unwind, and that I can choose what important tasks I need to get done during the day. This disorder to me can feel like it takes control sometimes, so I combat that by taking back some control via prioritizing, pushing myself to accomplish even the smallest things, and most importantly building in a ton of recharge time. Good luck with your healing!!"
bipolar,ersbdvg,t1_ers0nyh,1561208466.0,"Thank you!! Klonopin is short term until I get more stable. I just had a mixed episode for more than a month and was hospitalized. I'm hoping to only be on it for a short amount of time. Klonopin is my antianxiety med, Zoloft is the antidepressant and I'm happy with that one, but I'll keep this in mind! Hope you're feeling well!"

BPD,ern36f0,t1_ern33l2,1561043536.0,Just being in the present moment? What if the present moment is still affected by guilt over something recent?
bipolar,erhchpz,t1_erhc995,1560872316.0,"Yeah I'm on a high dose of lithium, very low dose of Zoloft, and an antianxiety. She keeps changing my meds though which has been triggering the mania."

BPD,er9krua,t1_er9jxn8,1560625263.0,"Basically idealization or devaluation. Either you love your partner and they're perfect, or you hate them and they're the epitome of evil. It's like black and white thinking. I can't control splitting, the other person doesn't even have to do anything for me to split on them, and I usually don't notice I'm splitting and just believe my current extreme thoughts about the person. I'm getting better at seeing them neutrally as a human with both good and bad traits more of the time, but when I split negatively, I start to withdraw from them, talk shit about them, and tell myself they're no good for me."
BPD,er9dq90,t1_er9dmza,1560622078.0,I'm so sorry. Have you found any ways to manage your splitting?
relationships,er5wvsf,t1_er4xvcl,1560535151.0,Best advice on the thread! Thanks!
BipolarReddit,eqm54i4,t1_eqm4wt0,1560156503.0,"It could be true, and you could also have mania. They aren't mutually exclusive. For me personally, if I'm staying up all night writing, it's the start of mania, and as it progresses, full blown mania can get scary very quickly. That's why I'd advise you seek help."
BipolarReddit,eqm4kc0,t3_byv6ql,1560156230.0,This sounds a bit like mania to me. Contact your psychiatrist.
BipolarReddit,eqlyg6k,t3_byrkpk,1560152926.0,"Yeah. For me it's been Ariana Grande, Pete Davidson, and Roy Orbison."
BPD,eqkuc4z,t1_eqkrxdq,1560131303.0,I'm not the only one!! Although what an annoying feeling it is!
BipolarReddit,eqixdij,t3_bykoub,1560095245.0,"I've heard that if you're on a high enough dose of a mood stabilizer, it'll prevent mania. I'm currently trying it."
bipolar,eqcpkqn,t1_eqchtf2,1559975520.0,Thank you for sharing your story and glad to hear about your friend and that things got better for you!
bipolar,eqcg5t9,t1_eqcccc7,1559968881.0,Were you on anxiety meds or a mood stabilizer at the time also? That sounds horrible I'm so sorry.
BipolarReddit,eqbrpkm,t3_bxzwp1,1559954834.0,You put into beautiful words such passionate feelings. I think I completely understand what you mean.

bipolar,eqappqo,t3_bxqra0,1559937543.0,Went to my doctor and am getting off Rexulti and onto Zoloft. Started outpatient. Found a new therapist. Did all this while coming out of severe mania.
bipolar,eq9lpet,t1_eq9evdi,1559911220.0,"No I work a desk job and while on Latuda, instead of doing my job I'd go on Reddit all day. My boss complained nothing was getting done and it would be affecting my performance review negatively, and constituents were going to HR complaining about how I was acting rude and didn't seem ok. I know about the complaints because around April (4 months into Latuda) I had realized I couldn't do my job but at the time didn't know why, so I went to HR to request medical accomodations, which were denied for logistical reasons (I wanted to move desks to a less busy area to try and focus better, but there were no other open desks), so my psychiatrist placed me on a medical leave to fix my meds (she noticed that was the problem) and join IOP. Unfortunately, the leave started a few weeks earlier than planned when I got off Latuda and onto Wellbutrin, which made me manic, so the leave started immediately in early May instead of late May as planned. My psych took me off that and put me on the Abilify which long story short led to my hospitalization fir 8 days in May. In the hospital I was put back on Wellbutrin so literally 2 days after I got out, I was manic again. I only just came down last week. Fuck May 2019 in particular haha having a month long medically induced mixed episode, directly following the Latuda apathy, was bullshit."
BPD,epyo5p5,t3_bwau7w,1559645833.0,I do this.
BPD,epyo3f2,t3_bwjpvt,1559645775.0,"When I'm depressed, my phrase to repeat is variations on 'what's the point?' Like, 'What's the point? What's actually the point? What's the point of suffering like this? What the fuck is the point?' etc. 

In more positive times I repeat lyrics by Kid Cudi ot Roy Orbison. 'I be high, then I be low...no need time worry, it's the story of my life', 'I don't feel pain anymore', 'Feel I'm out of my past life, died and came back twice, now I'm free', 'remember sunshine can be found behind a cloudy sky' and 'walk on with hope in your heart, and you'll never walk alone'."
BipolarReddit,epynoah,t3_bwhv8w,1559645267.0,"Smoked a cig, started a second one, then threw it away without finishing it. Ate half a Snickers. Listened to tons of music. Bought healthy groceries with my mom. Got to bed early but now up too early."

Not to be preachy, give advice or offer any help aside from saying I'm here if someone needs me. It was sincere and from the heart, and I'm happy people got something positive out of it. I'm sorry you didn't, but everything in my post applies to you all the same. I hope you don't have to struggle with burdens forever, and I will be here for you if you were to need me.

bipolar,epsle12,t1_epseop2,1559453506.0,"Lithium works well for me, but prior to starting mood stabilizers and then later after I tried Wellbutrin twice as an antidepressant, I got manic which necessetated the antipsychotics. Which were you on, why were you on them and did they do anything positive for you?"
bipolar,epsl8mu,t1_epsibhp,1559453327.0,"I mostly get them prescribed after mania, but since I keep getting manic I think my psychiatrist wants to keep me on them for awhile."

I take lithium as a mood stabilizer, plus an anxiety med. 

For me: Zyprexa was cognitive difficulties, Latuda was weight gain, exhaustion and suicidal ideation, Abilify was rage, memory issues and severe suicidality, and Rexulti seems to be causing irritability and paranoia."

bipolar,ep37nf8,t3_btjxg8,1559019059.0,"I hate Wellbutrin because on two separate occasions it's sent me into extreme mania. 

I hate Latuda because I started napping during work and also got some suicidal thoughts. 

But I despise Abilify. In just five days I became aggressive to the point of fighting and yelling at people, made a suicide plan and note, and ended up in the psych ward. 

Please be careful with these meds and be aware of the risks."

Right now it's just making me irritable but honestly that could be from other med withdrawals. Klonopin made me loopy as shit in the afternoon so I'm taking it twice a day instead. Still on tons of lithium. And finally weaned off Wellbutrin (again) after becoming manic on it (again). Hooray!
