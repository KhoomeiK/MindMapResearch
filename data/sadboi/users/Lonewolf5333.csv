depression,fc551ph,t3_efyc5z,1577443538.0,"Rarely do I develop serious crushes because to me seeing someone attractive is like seeing a Lamborghini on the street. Yes I can acknowledge that it’s a beautiful car but on the flip side I realize that my chances of ever owning one is next to impossible. It just isn’t in my realm of possibilities that I person I’m deeply attracted to would feel the same way.

On the rare occasions that I meet someone that crosses that barrier for me it always ends badly for me. About a year ago I develop a friendship with a co-worker. That friendship eventually turned in full-fledged flirting. It got the point that we were talking nearly daily on a personal level phone calls texts. I started to develop deep feelings. It’s like walking in a rain shower everyday to all of sudden seeing the sun. Me being me this was short lived. My crush was transferred to a different department. Then I made the mistake of showing my hand sort of speak. I was open about my feelings. Things quickly began to deteriorate. 

Even though my crush didn’t want the same thing I thought at least the friendship would remain in-tack. But fast-forward to now; without any explanation or even a fight my crush no longer speaks to me at all. I think it’s most likely because they’re in a relationship. But regardless of the reasons this relationship was just another glaring example of why I will never ever be in a loving relationship. The minute I let anyone in they reject me and that’s just the way it will always be for me. 

This might be tolerable if I had friends but I don’t even have friends. I don’t matter to anyone except the few people that feel obligation to care because we share similar DNA."
