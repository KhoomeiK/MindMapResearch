I honestly don’t know how I can help, mostly because of the fact that every person is different, but I can tell you what helped me (kind of) through my worst months with bulimia. During that time, I got into the emergency room around 5 times because my stomach was really aching, I barely could speak and my body felt very weak. To resume, I was really sick. Finally I got the courage to tell my psychiatrist about it. We discussed it, how serious the issue was, and the solutions aviable. She first told me to go inpatient in an ED treatment hospital but I refused, so I ended up being on medication. They helped me control my eating, which with time made me not purge that much, and my therapist helped me through with healthy coping mechanisms. There were times where I just couldn’t bring myself not to purge, even if I had barely eaten anything, but there were other times where I found the strength not to do it. I’d recommend you to talk to your psychiatrist about it really seriously. Tell them how your body is feeling if you haven’t yet. Get some exams done, too, just in case to check your health. Ask your psychiatrist what you can do. Like, real and finite solutions. Even if it takes time, you can do this. If you still feel like you can’t control it and your therapist/psychiatrist recommends you to go inpatient, I think you should consider it. I know it’s hard admitting to yourself you need that help, but it’s okay.

If you need to talk, and want to, i’m here for you. xx

PD: I forgot to mention I still suffer from bulimia, but it’s not even near how bad it used to be."
mentalhealth,f9e0vk5,t3_e4n4j4,1575238616.0,"Hey, don’t be scared. It’s okay to tell your therapist if you’re having suicidal thoughts. Every therapist is different, but being aware of that, my therapist has never called the cops or actually done something but trying to help me and trying to discover where the feeling came from. Even when I came back to therapy after trying to kill myself (two times, one with my first therapist and the other with my current one), they didn’t do anything like that, they just advised me to get into a psychiatric hospital (which I didn’t), and, again, try to get to the main reason I attempted.

I can surely say, if you’re feeling like attempting, talking to your therapist about it will honestly not make it worst. Nothing is worse than thinking about killing yourself. It’s dangerous. It’s painful. So just speak to someone. If you can’t afford a therapist, speak to someone you trust. Just speak to someone. It’s really important to get it out of your chest.

If you need and want, I’m here to help. xx"

So stop hating, I would really appreciate if you did. Your last comment, I took it as advise with no bad intentions, but now I feel like you're treating me like I'm dumb or something, and I don't like it, so please stop. Thanks."
