Anxiety,euuobja,t3_cdw8mn,1564047908.0,im 14 and experiencing the exact same thing but not sure how to put all my feelings in words. thank you so much for writing this and thank you to all the people that commented such positive things it really gives me hope and reassurance that things will get better thank you
Anxiety,euum0ku,t3_bws8f6,1564046782.0,I disabled my main instagram account and made one that is private and no one follows just so I can look at the funny posts and see what celebrities are up to. doing this has definitely made me happier in a way
Anxiety,euul7kd,t3_chk402,1564046363.0,"thats me every night im afraid to be left alone with my thoughts because I know they’ll end up making me feel terrible so i turn on a song or podcast and set a time for it to stop so as I’m listening to it at night it’ll turn off by itself when I fall asleep 

I hope this makes sense sorry"
