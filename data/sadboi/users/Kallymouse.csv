I'm from the US and my state has basically turned red from how many confirmed cases it has. I work in a hospital and the VA down the road has multiple confirmed cases already and increasing by the day. I wouldn't be surprised if the virus is at my workplace at this point. I currently have a slight sore throat - not sure if just the winter season or lack of sleep or more. Also with El Salvador already banning foreigners and likely other nearby countries following suit soon, it didn't feel right to go at this time. I had to cancel my plans. I'll be surprised if I can get half the money I invested back as credit. I know my situation is not as bad as others but I'm still miffed about it."
