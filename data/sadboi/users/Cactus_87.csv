You're absolutely right. It took me 32 years to start to believe that this is a condition you can manage/fight. I just let everything happen, thinking having bipolar disorder controlled every aspect of my life. People telling me that it is your own choice to get depressed as hell pissed me off so hard. And of course it's not your own choice to have depression, but it IS your choice how you fight/manage that depression. It was and still is hard to fully acknowledge that for me.

It's sad it took me this long, but hey - never too late to change, right?"

AskMen,ewxjp3i,t3_cq7q0p,1565859665.0,"Opinion from kiddo perspective: this post really makes me sad. I want to cry. I think it's great OP thinks about how to be a father. 

Me and siblings just grew up being around our parents, not interacting with them, basically being ignored. No guidance, no lessons learned, no cuddling when older than 7. They had no interest in us. No memories of playing together, no bedtime stories, no special kiddo-parent moments. No I love you's, no I'm proud of you's. Our mom hated us and said she regretted having children all the time. She's a narcissist and has a lot of mental issues. Our dad was not much around but always said our grades should be better (while we all did well, he just focused on the courses where we didn't have A's). Perfectionist father, mistakes were not allowed. Only good memories: holidays in France. Then he would play with us! Oh and our parents hated each other, they basically were fighting all the time when we grew up. 

So me and my siblings we're not okay mentally. No self-esteem, we basically hate ourselves and have a lot of confidence issues. Personally, I have attachment issues and problems with intimacy (and other non-related mental health problems). Yay!

I still don't know if I want children (32 yo). Afraid of fucking up in the same way + passing on mental health problems. But I would cuddle them all the time and tell them I love them too often and would be annoyingly interested about everything they do. Overcompensation that is.

Fathers of Reddit, tell your children you love them. Tell them you're proud of them. Cuddle, play with them and give them all the attention you have. You are their everything, their hero. It is fucking heartbreaking to be ignored. Now I am crying."

MadOver30,ev94q6h,t3_ce1n2e,1564305999.0,"I can relate so much. I got out of my childhood/teenage years completely broken and with a lot of mental issues. 

For me it helps to accept the idea that I will need the rest of my life to heal and fix things. That I am in therapy for 10+ years now and will keep on needing that. That I will never be stable, have kids or do all the stuff other people do. That idea gives me peace of mind: I don't 'need' to do stuff. I do what I can and that is okay. I'm done with doing what society/parents/others expect from me. 

Maybe the idea is depressing for others. But it makes me not wanting to die most of the time because I stopped feeling like a failure most of the time. Does that make sense? I guess not because I still do get depressed. I just don't feel that guilty anymore for 'not trying hard enough'."

I have the exact same issue. Stayed in a toxic workplace for 9 more months after I told myself I didn't want to stay there. Because of pushing through and being strong and not giving in. Shit I'm still not recovered 1 year later.

they got me thinking. There was some neglect and there was a lot of emotional abuse by my mom. I have a bad memory, a lot of suppression I realize now. I hate my mom.

I feel optimistic again after a long black period!
I cannot express my gratitude enough to you. Thanks for telling me something not one therapist told me about in all these years... I'm going to read those books.

I try to look into these emotions when I'm procrastinating. It helps. Be kind to yourself (usually I'm not) READ THE ARTICLE, BEST READ IN YEARS!
