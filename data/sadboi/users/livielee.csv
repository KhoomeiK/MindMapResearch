My success rate w/ windowsill props is about 75-85% conservatively. 
I've found that soil prop outdoors takes much longer, at least in my own experience."

Prop rate varies significantly, not all of my babes on the windowsill are this advanced. Just the ones on the ledge.

From my experience with burrows tail leaves, they take MUCH longer than a lot of other kinds. I placed my burrows tail leaves on the window sill almost 2 months ago and have had no real progress until a couple days ago (with just a few). Stay patient and keep and eye out for some pink emerging, that means it is visibly starting to propagate!"

succulents,fjyh6l2,t1_fjwv946,1583696666.0,"Dip after calloused and I try to get more than the end of stem; so anywhere where leaves are not in the stalk/stem. After calloused, I dip it in filtered water then rooting hormone. 

I can't speak to water propping for succulents but for houseplants it has worked AMAZING. It's like give the cutting plant steroids lol. Definitely speeds up the process and creates a lot more roots in my experience.

Hope this helps!"

Happy to provide more deets though (I'm new to this, literally this is one of my 1st posts on reddit, ever) :
With regard to the props in the back left, they have been on top of the soil for nearly a month and are just finally beginning to show pink lil roots (I'll snap a pic and post in a bit); they're soooo cute!
