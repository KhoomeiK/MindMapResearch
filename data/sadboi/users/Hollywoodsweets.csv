BPD,etbtu7n,t3_cax6ne,1562661589.0,"I've dealt with being hypersexualized since my pre-teen years. I've been abstinent for about around a month now (not entirely by choice) in dealing with a fall out with a FWB, and before him breaking up with a married man I absolutely loved but it wasn't morally right. So in saying that I've had time to grieve, feel hopeless, absolute despair, and feel like nothing in life was ever worth living without him, my married man. I sit and assemble car parts for work for 12 hours a night so I have way too much time to sit and think. I actually came to the realization I've been hypersexualized my whole life as a means of being distracted, that it was/is something I know I'm excellent at so I don't feel a profound sense of horror in ""doing it"" (huehuehue) because first of all I'm not scared I'm going to fail, it's fun, it's a means to an end, it releases endorphins, and it emotionally bonds the other person to me which is another way of ""ensuring"" they won't abandon me. So it's this multi level twisted and screwed up fun house. That while it seems so innocent in a way it was actually my way of abandoning myself, self sabotaging myself since I'd obsess over them and not take care of myself the way I needed to, and ultimately a complete lack of self love on my end. I'm saying this is where I'm at right now.... Not sure if anyone else ever has/or is."
BPD,etbsy9s,t1_etbopjw,1562660488.0,I like how you phrased it. Sounds so true.
BPD,etbome1,t3_cawljj,1562654621.0,"I can definitely relate. Please also try to remember that there are so many different combos of BPD! (weird!) So some of them honestly may not have been able to place themselves in your shoes. And a lot of people's reactions are based on how they're feeling and their attitude etc. You are completely wonderful. Don't doubt that.

Edit to add... Great job getting into therapy ðŸ™Œ"
BPD,etbll80,t3_cak0jx,1562651138.0,DAE: Ever become ridiculously paranoid over things you KNOW aren't true  but have to keep telling yourself that they aren't in order to function and not cut everyone off...?
Celiac,es8ocjj,t3_c5weuk,1561706169.0,"So awesome!! Glad you found a safe place to eat! I did the exact same thing and started crying when I finally found the gluten free section at Wal-Mart. -yeah it was ""hidden"" (insert eye roll) lol"

SuicideWatch,erzu0xy,t3_c10o3z,1561451494.0," I always end up isolating myself, cutting people out of my life, or just drive them away from being ""too much"" angry, negative, expectations etc. Anyway I met some great people at my current job one that even has the same mental dx as me. Turns out that yeah we're ""friends"" but I think mostly I just provide the workplace drama since I have horrible taste in men, and am pitied because of all my medical issues. So time to isolate once more and continue onward to self pity and continuous yet intermittent suicidal thoughts. I feel your pain. Glad you reached out on here! This place is pretty cool. Stay strong."
SuicideWatch,erzto4o,t1_erx4eyq,1561450940.0,"You're not alone in being in so much debt.  Fucking sucks, especially since it's mostly medical bills for trying to get better! Haha.  You have people that care here. And maybe all the things you have ventured on aren't your true calling and that's why they haven't planned out. Stay strong moon. You got this."
SuicideWatch,erzsv6p,t3_c40k9f,1561449683.0,"OP I've been thinking about this exact same thing lately. I've told a few people in different ways and just straight up that I'm suicidal. My fwb just ghosted me, my mother and my one friend gave me platitudes and said they loved me while basically running out the door. Ex husband started hitting on me. I get that yeah I probably won't commit suicide since I have little ones, but the feels, the agony, hell, and plans are all there. It takes SO fucking much to not give in most days, the other days are basically just blank. But the amount of denial and ignorance towards someone genuinely going through a hard time is absolutely fucking ridiculous. It's no wonder why most people DO commit suicide. The lack of caring and empathy is astounding. And on that note. I'm really glad you are still here. Stay strong."
Celiac,erstjok,t3_c3mg84,1561223824.0,"Perhaps you can apply for FMLA/disclose ""disability"" that way they can't harass you like that! I'm going to be doing both soon, since I still get cross contaminatined just about everyday. Really sorry you went through that and that your boss is a dick head."
