I do care about what this guy thinks because as long as I’ve known him he’s always been really kind and quiet, I really respect and appreciate his work, and he’s an incredibly talented person, as well as really down to earth. But clearly my thought process isn’t logical or healthy. I’m going to try to give less fucks because I can’t keep hating myself for everything I do, it does go a bit deeper than this interaction, I’m always constantly destroying myself for my  insignificant mistakes.

todayilearned,fonkkdn,t3_g89w3j,1587921263.0,"My family rescued an abused goffin cockatoo about 8 years ago. We really weren’t prepared for such a demanding pet, but he’s been with us almost a decade and is such a dick all the time. We know it’s not his fault he has such strong natural instincts. But he also has nerves of steel because before we got him he was in a small cage for the first 16 years of his life, and he’s never plucked a single feather. He’s doing a lot better now. His previous owners only gave him sunflower seeds and he only had one tiny stick to stand on which gave him arthritis and he would always be trying to lean on something to take the pressure off his feet. Now he flys around, has tons of toys and people who play with him. Still kinda sad for a bird, he’s not an easy pet because he gets territorial and aggressive during certain times of the year, and with certain people. It takes a lot of time/knowledge to treat a bird the right way, like for the first couple years we didn’t know that you’re only supposed to pet them on the head, and fucked up a little bit, but there are many small things that are vital to a parrot’s well being that if you mess up they will be unbearable.

IAmA,fobq4hn,t3_g6opvj,1587662447.0,"I go to a small (1500 people) private art school and we’ve had 3 deaths this year all in the span of 1 month. One suicide, one OD, and one unknown. Our school is very competitive and it’s common to say hi to a classmate and get no acknowledgement or response. Sometimes people are hateful without even knowing the person they’re targeting. The kid who committed suicide had artwork up in the gallery with the statement next to his art explaining his reasons. He died a few days after his work was put up. I’m wondering if we failed as a community? His suicide note was up for everyone to see and no one spoke to him! It became his memorial after. One of my good friends attempted suicide 3 times during the same time frame.

I had the idea of creating a mental wellness club for the students to train people to see the signs, even though they didn’t see it when it was clearly written out with the words suicide and everything. Mostly I just want to make a place where people can feel safe sharing their hardships and getting support. The counselors in my school genuinely don’t care they even refused to help me with planning and administration of a club related to their work even though they’re free most of the time. I almost got the club going before the virus hit. I know this isn’t the best idea and in a lot of ways we really can’t help those who decide to die, but it feels like if we at least see them and their suffering with empathy we can validate them in a way. There’s nothing worse when you’re dying inside and no one sees you, it feels like no one cares. But if you’re struggling and someone approaches you with kindness and openness to listen I truly believe there can be a positive outcome in some cases."

My parents refused to let me see a therapist in high school even though I was struggling so hard with depression, crying every day starting from like 5th grade. I only know because teachers were always concerned about how very unhappy I was. I struggled for a long time with self harm, school was torture i was bullied a lot. Eventually I lost the few friends I had because I was too depressed and just sat silently at lunch. Once I was brave enough to ask for help my parents yelled at me, saying they were “depressed” too saying I was spoiled and I needed to “change” my face. 

In college I got so depressed I dropped out, they still didn’t believe me and were pissed that I dared to be sad. Then I was raped, had an ex attempt suicide on the same week and I became not functional for a about 6 months. Then I hit mania and ran away to Seattle, got extremely depressed and came home, struggled for another year, then after remembering the sexual abuse from my dad finally I went into a phase when I was crying 24/7 and was suicidal for another 6 months and they finally noticed and believed me. Got diagnosed with bipolar 2. This year has been good metal health wise, finally medicated, doing ok. Makes me sad it took so long though, it feels like my life was just a black hole  with flashes of hypomania. Kinda lost my youth to it."

awfuleverything,fmpm56t,t1_fmpjam3,1586283285.0,"Literally if someone was able to have that type of insight when trying to die they wouldn’t be trying to kill themselves. When it comes down to it the loss of control is what drives people to it, and very few people attempt while planning on surviving. If someone is killing them selves they have run out of all resources. If there was something  keeping them here they would hold on real tight. People who attempt suicide are often sick, and if you don’t understand how mental illness works, that’s ok, just realize that it’s as real as any physical illness and people are not killing themselves for attention, but as Maria Bamford said, now is not the time to kill yourself. Late fall."
awfuleverything,fmpku1p,t1_fmpb2nc,1586282620.0,No because if they’re in the psych ward/ hospital for self harm they no longer have rights for at least 72 hours.
bipolar2,fmncmso,t1_fmmlf9k,1586223050.0,Yeah I thought so too!
bipolar2,fmmh7ft,t1_fma4hou,1586205205.0,"I finished it and I was a little disappointed, or maybe just sad,  but it did make me feel weird about how bipolar is portrayed. The bipolar doesn’t seem too inaccurate, but very much simplified into a digestible tv character. tbh but It was heartbreaking and it made me feel uncomfortable as hell, I, down to dm I just don’t want to ruin the show by talking about what happened."
bipolar2,fmmgor6,t1_fmm58w6,1586204938.0,I’m just usually mixed so it’s the best of both worlds like Hannah Montana. I started abilify today and I’m like wow I feel like Snow White hella singing and spinning around cleaning the house.
facepalm,fmm0860,t1_fmlx0zo,1586196375.0,"I’m in a fairly rural area in CA and they shut us down in early March, not sure where schools are still open, maybe Bakersfield or something?"
bipolar2,fmlztde,t3_fvzyz7,1586196162.0,"I get pretty anxious. Every person I pass seems to be stabbing me with their eyes, and I can feel it even if I don’t make eye contact"
TrollXChromosomes,fmlxkg6,t1_fmltz94,1586195045.0,Same. I tried and as soon as they showed the animals it was too sad to sit through. Idc how crazy or fun it is.
