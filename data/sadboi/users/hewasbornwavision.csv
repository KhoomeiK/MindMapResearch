todayilearned,eoor3nd,t3_bskgcl,1558745717.0,"I feel like a lot of people would become more open minded if they moved out of their state or out of their country to experience a whole new way of living, especially one that's not as abundant with opportunities as USA. If we funded a program where teens who are 18 years old would go out and work or learn in a totally different country with a group of other 18 year olds for a couple of years and this was a thing that was adopted by the masses, I think in a decade there would be more peace because a lot of the next generation would actually understand where all these different immigrants are coming from. There would be a lot more union among different walks of life. I can read about the hardships of x country or I can actually go live it and that in turn change my world view. Obviously in today's day and age there's no monetary gain in becoming more human towards those less fortunate but I think in terms of being a human being there's a lot to gain here. I feel like I'm rambling, but I'm a key believer that changing one's settings is what kick starts the change in ones perspective."
