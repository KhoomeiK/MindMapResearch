diablo3,fqjpft0,t3_gj63tj,1589413285.0,"I play D3 here and then when I'm experimenting. Other than that is no too interesting. Everything is about hitting a wall until you get that upgrade. And the story is basically Disney demons. I have read a bit of the first book because I'm curious to see the story telling is this bad in the original books but hey this is just the first.

I didn't finish D2 because I didn't have a PC after D1. I was going through D2 but had a mental crisis back then and fast forward I didn't even remember this franchise existed and fast forward my psychologist recommended video games because I was obsessed with programming. I remembered Diablo and browsed Amazon looking for a Diablo game to my dissapointment. That was an old PS3 my dad used for watching movie discs. Built a PC and sold a cheap tablet to buy D3 because that's the real game.

I play seasons depending of rewards but that's just useful for the game in the end. I got 1k paragons in just one season because the game goes stale without friends or meta groups. And that's too much effort to just do what everybody is doing, at least for me. Also, too much commitment as I can't do 8 hour game sessions.

The mayor attraction in seasons is the leaderboard that for me doesn't mean much unless you outperform with less paragons.

You could focus on achievements to spice things up."

Also this testing is with old games, games now are coming with far greater assets but because I'm not that technical about the rendering process then I can't really assert if the 15GB/s is needed for this new games. Wolcen uses a new technology for rendering called Quixel."

schizophrenia,ff8rlah,t3_esaioy,1579693284.0,"You could try Adderplex, it has helped me with the mental fog. I can now concentrate on things longer. And it has greatly helped me with dissociation. I'm on medication though, but medications didn't help me with concentration. Quite the opposite but Adderplex has helped me in that front. Also, talk to a nutrition doctor of some sort to see if your problems come from your diet. Maybe you haven't eaten something as regularly and that is taxing on your thinking."
schizophrenia,ff8piz6,t3_es7rc2,1579690476.0,"After I went through medication, these ideas of mind-reading went away for some time. After maybe 2 years into treatment, I started remembering my episodes and I start wondering, what if all that psychosis has some reality.  


My last thought on this subject is that there are recognizable face expressions and when someone knows you for a long time then they can discern even more of your expressions (subconsciously) and that why it appears your mind is being read when what is happening is that YOU are learning your own facial expressions. Even an empty room can have psychological cues that make different individuals have some (constant) response inside the room, like feeling nervous. Mind reading is physically impossible per se but face reading is possible and much real. One topic here is facial micro-expressions."

schizophrenia,f7kkz8t,t3_dw75nl,1573816027.0,"One common mistake made by psychiatrists is that they don't prepare you for how different you will feel while on medication. Life is different for sure and how we feel is different, accepting that has made me feel more welcoming to the effects of medicine and just fight through it."
schizophrenia,f7kkwop,t1_f7hw3a1,1573815922.0,"No. I think these side effects come from changing the dopamine on my brain. So I don't think it can be cured is a given for me. Really, if you can take up a reading habit it helps. Maybe 2 hours of reading every day at least that's what I'm going to try, the main idea is that you make new connections in your brain by reading and also it helps with the cognitive process in general. When you read you are using your memory and recalling a lot from it so I think that propagates the new synaptic connections. One positive side of the medication is that I think more logically I may miss the subjective nature of my mind being a poet but with enough practice I know things can be normal again. I'm picking up writing again in the mornings."

schizophrenia,f7h0yb2,t3_dw75nl,1573728246.0,"Same here, I became boring and memory doesn't work as much. Also feelings like from hugging people are really fleeting which I have to focus on to intensify. It took 2 years for things starting to appear in my mind again, I still have flashbacks of my past, the thing is that my mind is no that responsive to my thoughts. It's like a focused laser that can't be diverted by things like how funny some situation is. I'm working on this, because I think that it's just a thing of growing new synaptic paths being that my brain chemistry is different and in the brain, everything needs a chemical fingerprint to trigger. In another front, my chess ability diminished but with some time of practice has got better.

Reading helps a lot but I haven't been successful in a reading habit. I'm thinking to ditch Netflix before sleep and read a book instead."
