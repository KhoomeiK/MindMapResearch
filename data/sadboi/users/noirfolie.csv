He‚Äôs trying to divert. He does this a lot. 

8. Checks ins with the audience. ‚ÄúYou get me? You understand? You remember right?‚Äù He‚Äôs trying to manipulate the narrative and make his viewers question themselves and/or he‚Äôs trying to seem like he can relate to his audience."

He admitted to several things:

- Crying on video when Shiloh went to the hospital so his fans could see it (manipulating his audience). 
- Not listening to Kai‚Äôs boundaries with Billie

And so much more. He‚Äôs done for and I can‚Äôt wait until the police take him down.

Edit: He also never used the word ‚Äúallegedly‚Äù regarding his accusations of Shiloh ‚Äúabusive, manipulative, psycho, BPD, lied about her seizures‚Äù which is slander and he can actually be sued because he‚Äôs stating assumption as fact. He‚Äôs done."

‚ÄúSaid she would have it shipped to me before a big event. I went ahead and purchased. Two days before the event she told me she was out of my color and size. So she hadn‚Äôt even started it.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt call to see if she was lying. However during the call I found out she was. 

This situation isn‚Äôt my fault regardless of how you spin it. I spoke to her prior to purchase and she assured me it would arrive by Christmas, so that‚Äôs why I went ahead with the purchase. I didn‚Äôt contact her for 9 days, so by your logic, that‚Äôs spam messaging? I messaged her a total of 4 times (and once before purchasing) and some of it was in response to her. She told me she shipped it but then later admitted she didn‚Äôt actually ship it. Then did it two days later. 

As an Etsy seller myself, I‚Äôve never experienced this nor would I ever do this to a client. If I couldn‚Äôt meet a deadline, I‚Äôd be transparent. Her reviews show her doing this to several people the past few months long before the holidays. So I wouldn‚Äôt really use that as an excuse. 

Finally, my issue isn‚Äôt with USPS. I‚Äôm a seller, I know once it leaves the sellers hands it‚Äôs on the post office. However lying about dates and shipping, that‚Äôs my problem. 

Again, I‚Äôm sorry my post seemed to strike you in a way which you felt personally attacked, But if the shoe fits, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.

Onision,fbsytt1,t3_eeapgv,1577063820.0,I forgot about him for the past week. He‚Äôs still making these videos? Ugh
Onision,fb9n1va,t3_ebxu04,1576643143.0,‚ÄúAm I allowed to answer this?‚Äù Wow
Onision,fb9mvs9,t3_ebz5rl,1576642998.0,I relate so strongly! I was a fan and I used to be on his forums when I was 13-17. I‚Äôm so glad I came to my senses. I got curious a while ago and went back to look and found all of this and the Chris Hansen videos. I can‚Äôt believe I was ever his fan.
GoodPizzaGreatPizza,fb3gy93,t3_eaw61l,1576472813.0,It‚Äôs been happening to me with pepperoni üòÇ
Onision,fb3fjmu,t1_fb3f4v9,1576471689.0,I agree with everything you said. I also don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll walk away from this unscathed. Not when there‚Äôs this much evidence against him. I‚Äôm actually really worried that he‚Äôs still contacting minors.  I‚Äôm not surprised but I‚Äôm disgusted. He truly believes he‚Äôll face no repercussions. It‚Äôs gross.
Onision,fb2o85d,t3_eb6ofj,1576454635.0,"I believe he has connections and they‚Äôve been investigating him. My worry is,  working as a legal assistant, people don‚Äôt usually air that they‚Äôre investigating someone as it can cause a mess of everything and the person will try to backtrack and delete evidence. Even in the social media investigations I do for my law office at work, we don‚Äôt ever air who or why we‚Äôre investigating someone because they can go off the grid (which has happened so often). I hope the FBI is involved I really do. But who knows? üòî"
Onision,fb2o04b,t3_eb6s2e,1576454518.0,I was thinking the same. Greg either has his entire discord brainwashed or his sock accounts are doing the liking.
Onision,fb2nt5j,t3_eak6i5,1576454419.0,Don‚Äôt forget Shiloh.
Onision,fb1ufqx,t3_eavmj4,1576441352.0,Yeah this definitely needs to be sent to Chris Hansen. He verbally admits to everything.
