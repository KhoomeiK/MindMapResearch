SalsaSnobs,f8t66hr,t1_f8t3dlx,1574796657.0,"Not necessarily a required step, but rinsing them gets rid of the sulfur compounds and makes them less pungent while keeping the onion flavor and also brings out the sweetness in them. We rinse them, but I‚Äôve read other methods such as soaking them for 20-30 minutes in ice water, milk, or even vinegar. It really comes down to personal preference."

SalsaSnobs,f8q8jxw,t1_f8q5ygx,1574713788.0,"I had some ready made Jose Cuervo margarita mix that I‚Äôve been trying to use up, so we got creative. Muddle about  1/2 of a fresh jalape√±o (more or less- depending on how spicy you like things), together with just a bit of margarita mix to get it moving.  Pour into glasses with salted rim and add more margarita mix and about 1/4 of a Corona. Mix in some fresh lime, stir and adjust if more beer or margarita mix is needed. The beer adds a good flavor and tones down the sweetness of the margarita mix. Enjoy!"

We used 1/2 of an avocado and about three good slices of jalape√±o in an immersion blender, using store bought margarita mix to create a pur√©e. Added the pur√©e to more margarita mix and fresh lime and gave it a swirl with the blender. Poured the whole thing over crushed ice in glasses with a salted rim, garnished with jalape√±o slices. Just delightful!"
