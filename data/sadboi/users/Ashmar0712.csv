Dogfree,fqs5jet,t3_gkbgkh,1589598998.0,"You know it’s funny how dog nutters say that all humans are horrible & dogs are so much better. I think the crazy dog nutters should be talking about themselves they are assholes, they lack empathy for humans, and most are extremely lazy. (I’m not talking about all dog nutters but most) Many dogs nutters love dogs & hate humans it’s just a fact. I’m sorry that your mother was yelled at like that. That’s just so messed up! She should have done something about her dog’s barking instead of acting like she and her dog are the victims. She literally turned the situation on the kids wtf. I think she might be narcissistic.. idk some dog owners tend to be. She and her boyfriend are trashy people. Oh and yeah that last paragraph is relatable. it seems like almost everyone loves or likes dogs. I hate how they judge you for it but if you say you hate cats nobody gives a crap."

BanPitBulls,foamcch,t3_g6bv08,1587649111.0,Even pitbull owners who say they understand pitbulls should be watched and kept away from young children still own the damn things. They make their kids live with them anyway and when a pitbull attacks it’s very hard to stop it. Unless you have a strong weapon or pepper spray to help fend of that pitbull it could kill your child or severely disfigure them. Pitbull owners are all idiots for making their family members and children live with their dangerous pitbulls. Most pitbull owners don’t use leashes or strong ones that so even strangers aren’t safe. A pitbull could literally just escape a fence and start attacking people.

Dogfree,fn4g35e,t3_fziytq,1586640668.0,That’s just horrible! I’m sorry you had to deal with many stray dogs and you witnessed a cat being mauled to death. I mean 15 dogs that is nightmare fuel. I feel like this is a problem that needs to be fixed. I’m sure many babies and children have been attacked too in India. I also feel so bad for the cats involved. Dogs really are terrible animals and pets. I’m from America but I’ve always hated dogs as a kid. They are smelly and annoying. They are just scavengers waiting to steal people’s food. My mother’s dog has stolen a few sandwiches before. That dog has also stole cat food and destroyed many items and furniture in our house. I also hated how my parents and other people love on dogs so much. I hated how people treat dogs like kids and talk to them. I can’t understand what’s so great about them unlike dog lovers. I’ve heard about many pitbull attacks in America and how most people defend the pitbull after mauling a child to death. I hate dog owners like that. I really hate pitbulls and bigger dogs the most but I hate all dogs. My mother has this labradoodle dog that attacked our other dog once. These dogs are just beasts and if they weren’t living in our houses they would be on the street in packs like in India probably.
BanPitBulls,fmkw51v,t3_fvsdve,1586170929.0,God this is nightmare fuel this could have ended in tragedy! I’m so glad the mother realized the danger and got her kids out quick. I’m sick of idiotic pitbull owners letting their dogs go outside alone and without a leash! I hope something was done about the pitbulls or the idiotic owner. People shouldn’t have to feel unsafe in their own neighborhood! Those pitbulls are literally insane and should be put down!
BanPitBulls,fmfdzsd,t3_fulmk7,1586025262.0,I don’t understand why people waste their time on dogs/pitbulls anyway. If a had a shitbull bite me I would get rid of it no questions asked. Why dangerous your life and others around you for a worthless killer pitbull. That pitbull doesn’t love you your the only one who cares about it. Being a owner is not mandatory in life. Many people live pitbull or dog free. The pitbull attack could have lead to disfigurement or death.

BanPitBulls,flxrz0q,t3_frjxi5,1585588702.0,Could have been worse wtf is wrong with these people... that’s horrific! If I got a pitbull for adoption and it did that to me I’d be scarred for life and even more afraid of dogs. (If I didn’t know about how pitbulls really are I mean) I hope this person realizes that pitbulls are very dangerous and never gets one again. Sadly some people still care about pitbulls even after being attacked by one. That person should keep their kids safe and never get a pitbull again.
