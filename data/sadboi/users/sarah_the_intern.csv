There is also secondary drowning: this is when water does enter the lungs and causes swelling of the sacs in the lungs. This can develop over a period of hours or days. The swelling will prevent oxygen from reaching the bloodstream and lead to death.

UKPersonalFinance,fol9xkx,t1_fol9992,1587857806.0,"I’m actually an American citizen (working in Spain). Our taxes are so complicated because private tax filing companies intentionally lobby politicians to prevent taxes from automatically being filed via employers. They like to keep things complicated so Americans will pay $40 or more to be able to file their taxes easily. The other option is hiring a tax accountant, but not everyone has the money for that. It sucks. 

Edit: another option is trying to file your taxes yourself, but if you mess it up, you get fined and possibly thrown in jail for tax fraud

AskReddit,fol21ao,t3_g7wpl0,1587853335.0,I almost fell for the gift card scam once. I was selling something and someone told me they needed a google play card to connect to their PayPal in order to send the money. I didn’t know anything about google play cards and thought you could just buy empty ones to transfer money onto. I looked into it and suspected it was a scam. Then the “buyer” specified it had to be a $50 card and then I knew it was a scam.

insaneparents,fofyi6h,t1_fofva37,1587745037.0,"Obviously if someone is immunocompromised, that is a special case to be handled by a medical professional. Nobody here is advocating for children who fit into that special category to be harmed or die. But what do you think the ratio is between people with legit immune system disorders versus people who believe in woo woo science? Herd immunity has been strong thanks to public schools forcing children to be vaccinated, not because everyone goes out of their way to learn what vaccines their child needs in order to stay protected. With vaccines being mandated (except in special cases, like a legitimate medical concern), parents can stay ignorant all they want but their ignorance won’t lead to their child getting polio. I personally have a family member who caught polio as a child and she was paralyzed for the rest of her life. It isn’t something we want to risk coming back. 

And what if someone ends up carrying a preventable illness and spreading it to immunocompromised people? Were their lives less valuable in order to protect Karen who still thinks vaccines cause autism? 

But we don’t even have to ponder hypotheticals here. With the introduction of vaccines, people didn’t have to birth 20 kids anymore and hope 5 of them made it to adulthood. The death of a child has become a tragedy rather than normalcy thanks to modern medicine and vaccines. That’s just fact. 

I’m assuming you live in the US. The choice to reject a vaccine and just take your chances is a huge privilege of the first world. I’m American but live overseas now. The distance has really showed me how self-important some Americans are. Everyone thinks they’re the exception for no legitimate reason and call it “freedom.” Really, it’s the privilege to put others in danger just so the big bad government doesn’t tell you what to do."
relationship_advice,fofljdw,t3_g6duct,1587738382.0,"She used you to make a life-altering decision that she knew you were against. You consented to protected sex. She violated that. Sure, she can choose to come off of birth control, but there’s no justifiable reason to poke holes in someone’s condoms. She has shown that she does not respect equality in your marriage and is willing to sneak around to get what she wants, no matter how you feel about it. She’s doing the whole “I love you” thing because she got what she wanted from you: a third child and to be back in your home like nothing happened. Would she be whispering “I love you” if you stood your ground about having a 3rd (and she didn’t sneak around to sabotage your protection)?  

Serve her with divorce papers. Don’t waste any more of your energy on her. Your 2 kids are the only thing that matter now. She has shown that she does not respect your marriage. Please update us on what happens!"
insaneparents,fofga0o,t1_foemhjb,1587735232.0,"This is a dangerous mindset and is what led to the foster care system being developed. The idea of foster care goes all the way back to biblical times. Parents believed they could treat their children however they wished because they were their “property.” Governments recognized the ideas of child bodily autonomy and welfare and created laws allowing the government to step in if a child was in danger at home. Some people were against this idea because they felt like the government was impeding on their “property.” 

The government protecting the welfare of children despite parental beliefs is not a new concept at all. Vaccines are proven to be low-risk while carrying high benefits. A child shouldn’t be put in danger because their parents believe in woo woo science. Yes, some people have reactions to vaccines, but the numbers are so small compared to people who don’t have ill affects from them. Even if someone is personally pro-choice but anti-mandatory vaccines, that puts children in danger."

LifeAfterNarcissism,foczebb,t1_focwyfs,1587677900.0,"Yeah I’m wondering what caused the sudden break in silence. I’m guessing it’s one of a few possibilities: because we first got together about a year ago, maybe the girl he cheated with finally cut him off, maybe he’s failing his classes because I’m not there to do his homework for him, or maybe the quarantine is getting to him. A mutual friend told me the girl he cheated with always seemed sad because she felt so bad for him for having Crohn’s disease and he would tell her he wanted to kill himself. I wonder if she finally realized he doesn’t actually take care of himself properly and just looks for sympathy. 

But he’s definitely not getting any attention from me. I let that drag on for too long before I cut him off. There’s no way I’m hopping back on that train."
LifeAfterNarcissism,focu58k,t1_fococh8,1587675911.0,Thank you. I think I will consider blocking him after he stops contacting me daily. I want to do it at a time when he’s not paying attention. I just want to block him silently without him feeling like he “got” me.
