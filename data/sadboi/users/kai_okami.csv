I'm not an expert or anything, but my best guess would be because it's a small language. Google translate is usually pretty useless (this language isn't even on there), so you'd have to learn an entirely new language that only 4,000 people speak.

On the other hand, because the language uses so few letters, and because very few people know it, it probably wouldn't be obviously recognizable as actual words. So if you did learn the language, just speaking to the other person in it (without any cipher) would be more secure than speaking in common languages, and adding a cipher would make it even more secure.
