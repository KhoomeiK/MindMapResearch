I felt like staying with him was just telling him that it was ok for him to act like that and I'd stay. But in June I finally had the courage to break up with him. I felt like I was dead on the inside, but I just focused on myself, saw someone else that helped me see my value. 

Well, a couple week later he kept texting me to tell me how much he didn't appreciate me and that he didn't want anyone else but me. I let a couple months pass by because at that point I was just thinking that he missed how much I loved him and that's all. After 2-3 months passed by I kept thinking that if I didn't give it a try again I'd always regret it. 

I told him I was willing to get back together, but this time around I know exactly what I deserve and if I get anything less than that, I won't resitate to leave again. Well, now 5 months later, things couldn't have been any better. I feel loved, appreciated and cherrished everyday. Even on bad days we are still able to show how much we love each other. We also started couple's therapy a while ago and that helped SO MUCH with our communication issues.

I am glad I had the courage to leave and find my value. It was never my intention to break up with him to make him miss me. I broke up with him because I knew I deserved better, but he just decided to be better instead, and I appreciate that."
