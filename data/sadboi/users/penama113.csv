Dogtraining,fpi9h60,t1_fphxm2w,1588636341.0,"I disagree.

Edit: “dangerous” is a bit ridiculous, since I’m not suggesting he dominate his dog, but sharing what worked for me and recommending YouTube training videos. Get off your high horse and calm down, read people’s full comments before claiming they are dangerous."
Dogtraining,fphvder,t3_gd7ogu,1588628499.0,"Just wanted to chime in about my experience with a biting bratty puppy.... anyone reading please don’t judge, I’m not a dog trainer. I’m basing this advice on my personal experience with my aggressive Aussie puppy, who is now the love of my life and best friend. I’m a petite girl, just FYI. I almost had to give him up at 4 months because I was worried for my safety, he was incredibly strong and very stubborn. He wanted to be boss so we had a rough first few months together. I got him at 8 weeks but at 3-4 months he became a monster! And then somehow magically an angel at 5 months, (just for background info).

Again, I absolutely adore my Aussie mix (check my history), he’s the love of my life, and we are very close now that he’s 11 months, but as a puppy he was kind of mean!! Brought me to my knees once by biting my hand while playing fetch (he apparently didn’t want to give me the ball, even though he was giving it to me!). In the moment I yelled, pushed him off but he didn’t let go! so I ended up smacking him on the nose (fairly hard, I may add, not proudly) and he released. I immediately took him home (in tears) and put him in his kennel for time out.

We had real big issues with him biting me and trying to dominate me. He would scream if he was in his kennel and he wanted to be outside (it was nuts, i can’t fully describe how difficult he was). 

I finally lost it one day when he was out of control, screaming and biting, and I “dominated” him. I laid on top of him, refused to let him go/move, but didn’t lay down on him with my weight (goal wasn’t to hurt him! Goal was to get him to stay still for 30 seconds!). He acted like I was killing him, just FYI.

Anyhow, he was shocked but super calm afterward and quiet. Licked my face, etc and was good for a few days. I did this maybe once more with him a week later when he started acting up again, and he’s been a big angel ever since. He’s not neutered (yes I plan to when I can after Coronavirus is calm!) so I get he has testosterone and won’t calm down until he has been clipped, but it wasn’t just that in my opinion. He was full on aggressive as a puppy. I had to tell him who was boss and that biting people, other animals, etc, is absolutely not allowed, ever.

So in your case, where it wasn’t nearly as extreme, I would reinforce that you are boss in a calmer manner. Like you did here was perfect — you left her alone (ignored her) and then gave attention when she was being good. You might have to pretend to eat her food before she eats (assert that you’re dominant/alpha) and don’t carry her in your arms too often if you do now.  Dog whisperer had a lot of good advice, I loved watching her YouTube shows (so many good ones. Zach is great, sorry I can’t remember his last name but he has good positive enforcement videos).

People might think this is all horrible advice, just want to reiterate I’m not a dog trainer. My experience is that I’ve had 4 huskies (two past from old age, RIP my babies, and two current 8 month olds). This advice is based on my Aussie/border collie mix, who has been more of a handful than all 4 huskies combined (but also the smartest, most loyal, most rewarding dog I’ve ever had....!).

Best of luck to you!!! Sorry that was so much text!!"

I walk my dogs, play fetch, and train, but they still need a big field to run around in so dog parks are one of my only options. (I used to take them to my old high school tennis court to run but a janitor yelled at me and I haven’t been back since — yes I cleaned up fully with wet wipes, water, etc just FYI so the dude was just nuts, there were no signs or rules against having dogs in the court. Done it since I was in middle school, family has lived in the area 40+ years).

Anyway, when first got my Aussie mix, his first week after he could be out at dog parks etc from vaccines, a husky mix pinned him down and scared the heck out of both of us. I pushed the husky off and he refused to move, he was WAY bigger than my Freddy. I yelled at the owner and he laughed while pulling his dog off. It happened again within minutes and I just picked my dog up and left. Just rude, the dude would have found it funny if they got into a bad fight."

dogs,fofrylg,t3_g6xooe,1587741768.0,"This is infuriating and sorry to hear about, I really hate bad dog owners. The bad ones are the ones who don’t watch their dog and understand that it has the POTENTIAL to do so much because it’s a living breathing thing (so “don’t worry it’s friendly!” Doesn’t fucking work because if your friendly dog thinks he’s about to get hurt he’s gonna bite the fuck out of whatever he’s scared of)

I took my 3 dogs to the dog park yesterday (two huskies and an Aussie mix). I know dog parks are meh but Portland is usually good (and I was risking it with the virus so not many people were out).

I was so angry when some middle aged women came in, let their dogs loose, and just began chatting. They weren’t watching and one of their dogs was a pretty big terrier mix, who was all over my dog (fine at first but turned too rough).

I call MY DOG over to me and their dog flips the fuck out. My dog tries to get in between my legs and this other dog looks like he’s gonna bite my hand because I’m trying to keep him away from us. So I scream, “WHOSE GODDAMN DOG IS THIS?!” And they finally look up and take him, gently calling him instead of like trying to get him (at that point my boyfriend came over and he’s 6’6” with a deep voice so the dogs scattered). But it’s just... like why? They weren’t paying attention, they don’t care? They left without a word which was also infuriating. 

My guy said my dog may have nipped at theirs (entirely possible, he’s an Aussie and they nip/herd) but this isn’t typical of his behavior. If anything, they were playing rough and he mouthed the other dog (like he does with my huskies, not biting down, wrestling). But either way, I was trying to break up the rough play and the other dog refused to let mine come to me when I was calling him (and my dog was obeying). 

So fuck those owners who came to the dog park to chat.  Go online or use your phone to chat, watch your damn dog all the fucking time."
depression_help,fo8j296,t1_fo8a4fs,1587597523.0,"Whole heartedly agree. I had a best friend since I was 14, I’m 30 now. Was her maid of honor at her wedding 7 years ago. Haven’t spoken to her in 3 years now (basically since I got divorced from my abusive ex) and I’m still not sure exactly why she stopped talking to me. One day she was my friend for over a decade and then one day she ghosted me.  

We had fights on and off before (not speaking for like 1 year+, but that was right after high school). We were best best friends, I mean we did everything with each other.

I have the weirdest suspicion she stopped talking to me when I started making good money and got skinny🤷‍♀️ she was always jealous of weird things, I think that was something she couldn’t handle since weight was a struggle for both of us for years. She also took a chance and opened a business, which i supported in so many ways, but it was a struggle (delivery/customer service) and when she saw me making money in business she would make comments like I was lazy. (For example, if I complained a colleague made more money than me, she would tell me I’m selfish for not being happy with what I have...)

Friends and people who care about you will always care about your well being and want you to have more, to feel better. They will work to make that happen. Don’t beat yourself up over this person."

And not one will know of the war, not one
Will care at last when it is done.

AskReddit,fni8ikm,t3_g1jljr,1586975778.0,"In an interview for a job (receptionist), they asked what my life goals were. I said to find a stable job and then have kids with my husband. There was a man and a woman at the interview. 

The man asked, “if that’s the case, why don’t you just have your husband work and support you so you can stay home with the kids?! Doesn’t he make enough money?” 

He was super rude and judgey, like it was a dumb answer to give. I didn’t know how to respond so I just laughed and made something up on the spot. No my husband didn’t make enough money (btw, ex husband now). Also, I wanted to fucking work so how rude..! Like, didn’t you fucking ask what I wanted in life?! You want me to lie and say I wanna be president or something?! I’m glad I never worked there because I ended up working at my favorite job for 3 years before moving cities.

Damn tho, not expected for a hip Portland place to act like that. I mean, you’d think everyone in Portland would be progressive but here’s this older fat asshole (lots of tattoos and a beard he has never brushed but he’s “true portland” ya know) telling a young feminine 24 year old her that dreams of steady work and children are stupid. 😂 Just dumb, not based on my ability at all, it was of my image.

My favorite job’s interview went something like this, which is how I knew it was the place for me (I’m totally over exaggerating, the manager didn’t swear, but here’s the gist and the story I told everyone anyway):

Manager: *looks me up and down in dress and heels* can you fucking WORK BITCH?
Me: YEAH BITCH. LIKE FUCK.
Manager: GOOD. I like your purse. Also, sometimes we get drunk here and you need to lock the front door. Put a fucking sign up.
Me: that’s okay, the purse is big enough to fit you and another coworker so I can drag you to your desk.

When I vote for Biden this time around, I’ll be fucking pissed if the message is the same. I have legitimate concerns over Biden, so I absolutely hate it that people are saying “well what are you gonna do, vote for trump?” Well obviously not but does that mean I can’t talk about my concerns?! The party wants anyone out of line with their agenda to “shut up and take it”, how is this dissimilar to Republicans?

We will never get anywhere in this country with the two party system. We need honest and open discourse, not a civil war where we can blame “the other” and keep tottering ideals that fit into our own narratives.

dogs,fmtxnkv,t3_fx9el3,1586380837.0,"I completely agree with the post above and I am strongly against anyone walking off leash around neighborhoods!! I’ve had multiple encounters where I find an off leash dog with no owner in sight.

That said, I have a related question about my private property and Aussie off leash. Would love opinions.

My family lives on a private street, which we “own”, but we technically have neighbors. My house is the only home on the street but we have houses on either side (entrances are on other streets). We had a kennel put across/on the street, a shed, car parking space etc, and we also pay taxes on the street (& have to fix any potholes, etc ourselves, just for background). 

I recently had an argument with our mail carrier who was using our street as a short cut (almost running me and my dog over one day bc they were driving too fast). I lost that argument because government vehicles can go wherever they please I guess. But what about random people/my neighbors?

I usually always have my Aussie off leash on my lawn and in our private street. We play fetch, his recall is amazing, he’s a good boy. I got PISSED at an older couple recently who were walking their small dog and flipped out at me for not having him on a leash (but it’s my property?!) when I mentioned this, they ignored that and just left without apologizing.

We do have several “no trespassing” signs but people completely ignore these. If we installed a gate it would be different but that’s expensive (and it would be two sides, not just one).

Can anyone tell me what they think about this? I’m not trying to be a dick, I don’t mind if people come down our street just walking, but I feel I’m allowed to have my dog off leash on my private property. What do you guys think? Is it just bad to have dogs off leash even at home?

Long story short, my white husky got out and was roaming the neighborhood. My grandpa and I were after him in our car.

A neighbor had coaxed him into his car and beckoned us over, but when I went to go get him I realized it wasn’t my Yuki!

My grandfather argued with me that it was obviously my dog, and we were taking him home, etc (“baby, you’re crazy, what other white dog is there?”) And then as of on cue, Yuki runs up and says hi and then runs away (toward home). 😅

The neighbor took the other dog because it had a collar/tag and we took off after our dog (pretty sure at that point he was resting on our lawn 😂). One of my favorite stories about him.

Another quick story about this dork: once I was coming home from downtown and thought “huh that stray dog looks like Yuki” and then I stopped the car and said “YUKI!!” And yep that was him! He had gotten out and no one called to tell me 🤣 “he’ll come back!” My parents said!

I grew up with huskies and I was shocked and how hard I thought it was to train my Aussie. I thought about giving him up because I seriously didn’t know what I got myself into and he never stopped running!

So glad I stuck with him because he’s literally the best dog I’ve ever met, I would die for that dog! I have two husky puppies (both 6 months, same litter) and I still think they are easier than my one male Aussie tho so just fair warning that it’s hard at first but so incredibly rewarding. Freddy is as smart as a person, which makes our time together ridiculously fun (and probably why he was so hard at first — so damn smart!!)"

My first stop in Portland was Powell’s 12 years ago, can’t stand to see these great iconic places suffer."
husky,fkxxi0c,t1_fkxnpsd,1584637326.0,"Completely agree!! Huskies are high energy but I was completely floored by how much more energetic Australian Shepherds are after having two huskies growing up. I currently have two husky puppies and an Aussie — the Aussie was more work than the two huskies combined!! 

Also, I’m getting very good response so far from the pups for recall training so even that isn’t as bad as people make it seem. My first two while growing up had no recall but they didn’t get the proper training for it so I’m glad my babes are 

Huskies are exceptional dogs!"

The Dr mentioned how smart Freddy was too and then told a story about another dog who’s owner would calmly talk to him and the dog would listen/understand. 

Vet: “The owner says to the dog in his normal voice, ‘would you rather be a lawyer or dead?’ And the dog lays over playing dead!” 😂 The Dr was adorable, little old man who obviously loves dogs."

dogs,fkaqltn,t3_fh7wo9,1584016962.0,"..... I will never forget that goddamn skunk smell on our private street (and my dogs) for WEEKS!!

We have a tiny street, and we have a kennel directly across from our house (it’s not really a big property but a big house in a secluded area). My huskies usually slept outside until the summer months when it was too hot.

One night I heard my youngest husky cry-barking like something was wrong so my grandma and I went outside to check. The smell hit immediately!! It was terrible, and we saw Yuki (older, strong husky) across the street with a GIANT skunk in his mouth, dead by the time we were out there. Yuki was shaking it so hard but then dropped it when he saw me and of course, tried to give me kisses (LOOK MOM LOOK!)

The skunk was going after their food (it was spilled over at least) and my poor Yuki-Bear had scratches on his face. Definitely an ordeal, glad my puppies weren’t seriously hurt.

.... but then my grandma and I didn’t want to pick up the skunk so we used a shovel to roll him down the street because he was heavy and couldn’t get him onto the shovel correctly 😂 animal control picked him up but the stench lingered!"
siberianhusky,fkapsvs,t3_fha2jc,1584016334.0,"Awww, the love of a dog and their owner/family!! 😍 Loved reading this. I get emotional with dog stories, my Aussie just jumped up on to my bed when I was reading this because he can sense my emotions better than I can ☺️

I think if I was in any danger he would spring into action like your beautiful pup did. He shocked me as a puppy one night when visiting family, my cousin left for work at Starbucks at 3 in the morning but had to come back for something. When he heard the door open from the outside (which we were close to, in the living room) he found his big boy bark! Woke me up, I was completely in a daze but the tone/urgency of his bark made me scream “WHO’S THERE?!” And cling to him for protection 🤣 (5 month old puppy wouldn’t do much damage but Freddy sure sounded like he could!) Rofl my poor cousin was scared senseless, none of us knew he was that loud 😂 lucky she’s an animal lover.

Anyway, dogs are amazing and we don’t deserve them 💕 The lengths they will go through to protect us and make us happy."

Dogtraining,fk41efo,t1_fk3qhpj,1583851243.0,"The cuddling gets better!! I posted above about my Aussie but he REFUSED to cuddle with me until 5 months. One day he magically came and jumped in my lap and that was it, now he’s a Velcro dog!! 

Seriously, we cuddle every night in bed, he’s my little buddy. Herding/working dogs take quite a bit more patience, firmness, but they are the best adult dogs! Can’t say this for all but this has been my experience so far."
Dogtraining,fk411z4,t3_fg95v9,1583851027.0,"Awwww I’m so sorry, I know exactly what you’re going through!!! My Aussie, now 9 months, was a terror at 3-4 months!!! Sounds very similar to your dog.

Biting, herding, literally a tornado in the house, would never stop!! I wasn’t sleeping, I seriously thought about giving him up because he was so difficult. I had huskies before and they are 1000x easier as puppies!!

So glad I stuck with him tho because he’s literally the best dog in the world! I think Corgis are also herding dogs or have ridiculous high energy anyway. Keep being firm, it just takes time. Freddy suddenly became the best dog around 5-6 months and all the consistent training really paid off. His teething was horrible so I think that had a lot to do with it. It’s more painful than we realize! They act out like jerks.

I did, however, have a mini freak out episode at Freddy around 4 months for his biting and it oddly helped. Not that I recommend it but I think I established dominance that day which made him much easier to train. Again, I don’t recommend it, just telling you what happened, but I screamed at him to stop biting and then laid on top of him (not hard enough to hurt but enough to hold him down). I waited like 30 seconds but he was still struggling so a full minute until he was quiet. 

He had literally brought me to my knees from biting my hand, had me in tears, he was very strong for a puppy and I’m a small girl, so I was very relieved he got the message after that. I was getting worried he would hurt me later (refused to let go of my hand!!!) but his dominance/aggression is mostly gone now, and again, he’s my sweet little buddy! If you look at my profile I have a ton of pics/videos, he can even be off leash, he’s seriously the best!! These dogs are just so smart they are hard to get in line lol!!

Best of luck to you!! Feel free to DM if you have any questions/want to talk."
Lore_Olympus,fk0tuz8,t1_fjz86ig,1583766028.0,"“Noticed a sharp decline” go make your own web comic and then go ahead a critique Rachel’s. Like Jesus Christ, you aren’t watching a Star Wars movie made by Disney (understandable to complain about) but for heavens sake, it’s a free web comic. 

You guys get mad at Garfield minus Garfield too? Shut the fuck up.

Edit: also, way to act superior “I’ll correct this for you” for sharing an opinion that this fan base is turning toxic and annoying the hell out of other fans and the actual creator. Again, go shut the fuck up."
Lore_Olympus,fjz50cb,t1_fjysra6,1583711530.0,"This sub is turning into a place for people to bitch about the free web comic. So yeah, I’m saying shut the fuck up and fuck off to everyone complaining about the “cliffhangers”, “how slow the comic is” etc. When you go back and read from start to finish, this comic is quite amazing with a ton of detail.


There’s been too much garbage going back to the creator, she had to shut down her Discord account because of complaints like this (god I wouldn’t want to talk to y’all either, I’m just here defending the comic).

Go somewhere else to complain, or better yet, be happy with the fucking free web comic."

Of course it’s a cliff hanger. You people demand too much from a free web comic. Even if you’re paying the coins to get the fast pass, it’s not going to the artist the way you think it is so be quiet already and let the person do her hobby!

Or again, take it to the complaint sub, I think LOComplaints or LOFeedback or something like that. Stop posting this garbage here, I see it every damn week.

Anxiety,fjomeep,t3_fein53,1583530692.0,"So true....

After I got divorced (literally the same week) I went on a company overnight trip and had to speak in front of the room in a group. I was in speech/debate in high school so I thought I would be okay.

... except we were told last minute to pack because we needed to leave at a certain time for the bus, so I had to run and grab my items before I did my speech. My heart was pounding.

I got up there and completely froze. Almost cried except an amazing gentleman (hilarious dude) made a joke and jumped in front of me and started talking.

Love him, and I got through my piece sounding like an idiot but still got through it. I brought this up later and no one claimed to remember (good people lol). 

Hate my anxiety for taking away something I used to be good at.... but glad to have a support system."

As someone who has been both an alcoholic and severely addicted to marijuana, I can tell you that my worst events, worst actions or injuries happened with alcohol.

My worst with marijuana?? .... being stoned all the time? Not having money because I spend it on weed? 

I mean... the issues are tremendously different. I need to cut back smoking just because I want to save money, but alcohol was going to literally kill me, not pot. 

With pot you can’t like, pass out on your arm and wake up with it completely immobile for the rest of your life (not me! we had a foster care with a woman who was an alcoholic and this happened to her when she blacked out. Once she left she went right back to it and it killed her... alcohol is no joke.

This type of “motivational” talk is not helpful. I’m out in nature all the time with my amazing dogs, on medication, feeling great most days, and there are just times I get really fucking depressed. 

This is just my mental illness. Trivializing it, and worse, making it seem as though my own mental health issues adversely affects others (“bring other people down”) is bullshit. My support system isn’t much of a support system if they complain I’m always “bringing them down”. I support my family and friends in ways they need, they support me in ways that I need.
