I worked for myself doing a few ventures, mostly positive outcomes, but everything has changed in the last year.

To answer to your comment- life costs money, we sometimes take for granted/underestimate what we make/spend. From the time you wake up until you go to bed, hobbies, bills, taxes, more bills, interest on bills, broke consumer products from excessive consumerism, groceries, losing 40 bucks in those jeans you can't even find, that skydiving trip that costed 250 for a voucher we never went on, well beceause we spent so much lasts night at the get-together.

 I will say this though some of the most implusive decisions I have made ended up paying off in other ways. Of course I wish I saved a lot of my dough, but it takes dicipline of like Silverstein levels and being a straight miser. Fuck that, So many people seem bitcy when talking abuot their pasts and what they spent on, they seemed so happy in the moment though."
