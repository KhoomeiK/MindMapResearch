I'll have the images of the pornstars stuck in my head and be very conscious of how I look. It makes me dry/act disinterested (as expected) but because of that I then get more agitated as I'm worrying I'm not being good enough and he's probably thinking right now that porn is better - thus going along with it for him to try and win over me Vs porn/other women.

I have really bad abandonment issues that I don't really keep in contact with anyone other than my boyfriend as I feel like a burden to annoy someone with my presence. I isolate myself so I can't face being rejected by another. However, it's toxic af when with my boyfriend because I separate myself to protect myself, then my brain goes into PANIC MODE! And I start splitting because they let me leave/isolate myself therefore it feels like they're abandoning me but deep down I want them to fight my BPD and want me! But everything I say will contradict what I want, like some sort of way of weeding out someone perfect who will always be there for me.

You see much desperation in men due to the pressures of losing your virginity, how many it's been, having a girlfriend etc. As a woman porn has also made me objectify myself. For much of my life I haven't been able to build healthy relationships as I haven't been able to open up to someone emotionally, I only knew how to be a sex object. Majority of my exes did not know me as a person at all, I couldn't be myself I felt far too anxious it was unbearable! But as soon as they were horny I took down all my walls. And of course - me behaving so insecurely like such - I attracted the exact kind of guys you'd think.

I'm going through a similar situation with my ex PA boyfriend, it's been a few months since he's quit but it hurts the same as the say I found out. Things have improved for us though because we have bettered our communication and I've expressed that he needs to be transparent.

I'm tired of having to ask things so he can lie or to find out lies, the courage and confidence to be transparent and come clean to me myself about anything is so helpful. Even if it's just about their emotions from anything in the past or how they feel about what happened etc. I hate feeling like signs of love are asked for, I need their drive to surprise me with reassurance and love on their own initiative. I also really need their understanding of my pain, I do not trust a liar and they have to accept that and work on it. Whenever my PA is upset or confused why I don't trust them it just feels like a stab in the back as they don't see the consequences to their actions. Just got to be super gentle and mindful of the fact that even though you're in recovery and it may have happened some time ago, the betrayal hurts me like it just happened all over again everyday. I will trust them when I'm ready to, amounts of recovery will help but cannot undo the damage that was already done."

Ironically my upset and betrayal from my PA fantasizing and sexually acting on others has caused me to fantasize of someone, anyone else that's better.

loveafterporn,eydwoww,t3_cw4rsk,1567025727.0,"This really resonates with me as I have BPD and I try to cope with my childhood trauma everyday. I'm self-conscious as it is so discovering my partners porn use was heart breaking, even more so when you see Instagram is also a use. It just feels so dirty, it's beyond porn at that point, it's just straight up cheating they're real people. I mean so are the ones in porn it's the same, but it's so much more of a twisted knife in your back when it's that much more real. I've just been to a festival with my PA and it made me feel very uncomfortable when I was sober, constantly comparing myself and surrounded by the half naked 'festival sluts' he was subbed to. It just felt like an eye candy fest for him. I'm not sure I'll ever be comfortable on a beach with him knowing he's used Instagram bikini pics of people he also knows. It's so disgusting and wrong.

I love them also and I'm trying everyday to cope in some way, I'm still not sure what will happen as the pain is still unbearable. It may get raiser if they try hard with you, but the pain will definitely never go. Never."
loveafterporn,eydvmk9,t1_eydg97s,1567025315.0,"Yes I second this. It's gaslighting, they're denying your reality/feelings to benefit them. What you feel is what you feel and you have every right to, after all you've been betrayed."
loveafterporn,eydv8gv,t1_eyd67eb,1567025167.0,"Not relapsing yet doesn't make him good. Of course that's great if that's the case, but there's avoiding your addictions and there's changing yourself to remove addictions. You can not relapse for some time by avoidance, but that need for it is still there. In order to actually change the neurological pathway for the addiction the addict needs to be the most vulnerable they've ever been. They need to be transparent with you and do all they can to support you, not making you feel invalid because their actions causes you pain and distrust. They need to be understanding of your triggers and theirs, they need to look into why they've become addicted and how it's even unhealthy outside of relationships. It takes A LOT more to remove an addiction rather than just simply avoiding it. Avoidance and not understanding it and your pain will only lead to a more damaged relationship and most likely a relapse."

I'm the same, I also don't feel comfortable browsing clothes or even social media anymore in front of my boyfriend, as there's so many half naked/naked women. Same as you, even if it's for clothing I feel like it's a loophole and a trigger for him getting hard. God don't even start on sex scenes in movies, his porn has made them extremely uncomfortable when they barely phased me before.

If anything, *needing* explicit images, videos, scenarios.. just shows you're out of touch with your sexual senses. If you can't be turned on just by stimulating yourself, then that is very, *very* sad. Too many guys have porn induced erectile dysfunction, they can't last or cum at all to normal sex because they aren't at all prepared for what is genuine.

I'm sorry you've gone through this and it's really sad to see the backlash on your post. Most of the time guys give hate as they just want their porn. They lack sympathy because their emotions are based in their dick and label it as ""Just Porn"" because they're too afraid to look any deeper. When you really dig deep into the psychology of watching porn, and flip it onto the girl doing it in the relationship, how many guys would feel comfortable about their partner being turned on by another and acting on it?

Well when you see your boyfriend (who you've been committed to 100%) looks at porn of all these perfect women with toned small figures and massive perky breasts, you can't help but feel second best. They resemble nothing close to me nor the average beautiful woman. Porn like media in general, they only show a very niche percentage of women who are unrealistically 'perfect' which generalises a false image of what women should look like. And in most cases these women have plastic surgery, heavy makeup and Photoshop applied. Just like porn it teaches us that we aren't as sexy, aren't as good, we'll never be as good and should look like such. I used to be pretty ok with myself until I saw what my boyfriend was looking at, he lied about what he likes and doesn't like so I feel extra confident for him right?

I'm sure you feel remorse, but you need to show that through the best communication you've ever given followed by action. If you say you're gonna do something, do it. If you fail, admit it."

loveafterporn,etyqjyh,t3_cdwsq2,1563321343.0,"I'm exactly the same, I just feel like a part of a collection, just another option, just another flavour to taste from a pic n mix. It's so hurtful to find out all along you haven't *really* been the only one."
BPD,etypwmb,t3_ce2rqc,1563321116.0,"Paranoia is the biggest driving force of my BPD. It's the paranoia that triggers the overthinking, that triggers the fear of abandonment. It's what gives me splitting headaches and dissociate because I withdraw from reality, it makes it hard to know what's really going on or what I've made up in my head. It's so awful it draws me away from everyone as I can't stand the idea of facing anyone in the state."
BPD,etypjy8,t3_ce3jgd,1563320990.0,"Honestly same. I first decided I did want kids when I'm older a couple years ago, but all I've seen is my mental health continue to sway. It would be unfair to raise a child when I can't look after myself. But who knows perhaps some day I'll be ok."
BPD,etyp6fh,t3_ce1u60,1563320850.0,"I'm the same, I bottle things and mostly feel numb or sad until it bursts out. I just have to try talk it through to my boyfriend as he's the only one who is there for me, but because I don't know how to deal with my rage I say things I don't mean and sadly he gets it all. However, since therapy I've learned there's no shame in feeling angry and it's good to breathe, collect your thoughts first before speaking in that state of mind."
BPD,etlagtp,t1_etl4z49,1562929513.0,"He has BPD too we kinda co-depend on each other, it's mutual and I'm very happy and confident in the relationship, I just split about this stuff from time to time."
BPD,etlae8e,t1_etl76ef,1562929423.0,That is an interesting concept
sex,etl0ppg,t1_etkf77a,1562915954.0,It's sad because they then find it hard to learn different or think not using their dick. This is why so many women like myself feel objectified during sex and such an immense pressure to not be ourselves but what they see in porn.
sex,etl0m2m,t1_etjg7ky,1562915825.0,"There's nothing wrong with wanting porn like sex but it's when that's all they want is the problem and all that matters is them jerking off in you, not how you feel."
BPD,etk5jdt,t1_etk4wy9,1562889439.0,"I mean my biggest problem is I want to be everything someone desires, I do all I can to be so, which is very unhealthy I know. And they've told me that I do fulfil them completely, hence why it hurts because it feels then they're just lying or doing it to admire a better woman which ofc hurts. I don't ever expect to be everything someone desires but I try. I know I'm not perfect, I know I'm out of shape but so is he and I never feel the need to look at another man in a way, so I can't help but feel like I wish it could be more equal. I can't stop having complete love and tunnel vision for an fp to the point it hurts because I know I never get that back."
BPD,etk52h6,t3_cc0fqe,1562889093.0,You literally just explained my mum and my childhood pain
BPD,etk4ysh,t3_cbzwyz,1562889018.0,"I understand this is good but it's also my biggest problem. I prioritise building others up so much I forget about me, I do things they want, not what I want, I think to do things that will make them happy - not me."
BPD,etk4770,t3_cc0lhm,1562888465.0,Your boyfriend doesn't deserve this behaviour
