AskReddit,fkgwtqc,t3_fif65f,1584178231.0,"Started on my 12th bday when i sat down and saw my thighs squish. Turned into an 8 year struggle of losing and gaining the same 20 pounds. Bingeing, purging, starving, exercise, restriction, and mantras of self hatred.  In 2018 i lost 52 pounds, going from overweight to underweight in a matter of months. I was at my lowest point physically and mentally. 
I started to get better when i got news i was (somehow) pregnant. I forced myself to start taking care of myself and eating for the babys sake. After getting my weight back up, my brain was functioning better and it was easier to continue taking steps forward. Even after having a miscarriage i continued to eat. I have maintained my healthy weight for over a year now. I still hold a lot of self hatred and disordered thoughts but i try not to act on them anymore."

BipolarReddit,fi494zo,t3_f6bqoa,1582136468.0,"Getting a dog was one of the worst decisions i made. Still have the dog, will most likely be dumping the responsibility on my parents though. I cant afford vet bills, i have no energy to go out for walks especially in the frigid winter, shes smelly and disgusting and furry. Thankfully not loud and shes trained somewhat... but sometimes she annoys me so much that i honestly hate her. She is way too much work for me. 
Fuck those people that say getting a dog will help. I remember how many breakdowns i had while she was a puppy. And still now when i come home to a mess.

I got rid of a female cat already for being too much of a shithead. I still own a male cat whos a chill dude, and a female ball python, and the dog of course.
Cats are easy for me, feed twice a day, scoop poop once a day, sit around and use feathers/laser pointer to get him zooming around, then lots of pats!
Snake is also great! Just gotta pay attEntion to temp/humidity, refresh water, feed every month, clean pees out when they happen, and clean tank when she poops/sheds. She is so chill to handle as well, she loves to crawl under my blankets to be warm while i watch movies.
Would highly recommend lower maintenance pets to those with mental illness. Ya’ll needa get some fish instead of buying puppies"
