BPD,fm9q9mh,t3_ftqkgo,1585874138.0,Literally explained my feels too! Itâ€™s hard! Sending you love!
AskReddit,fji06pa,t3_fdcbl8,1583358294.0,Myself! Agh.
EDAnonymous,fjgnb4p,t3_fd5o66,1583331196.0,Same!!! It really bugs me!
unpopularopinion,fj92i3v,t1_fj8103c,1583129700.0,"This is a disappointing comment. I disagree, even if this was with good intentions. How about we as a society make the world more accessible for everyone and there differences? Why would my son have to feel like an outcast because heâ€™s not boring like everyone else! Because his mind works differently. So many people see the negatives of autism, what they donâ€™t realise is that there are some fantastic qualities. Of course itâ€™s good for them to be around people that understand them... but I think EVERYONE should try and understand them.. not cast them off."
unpopularopinion,fj92ao6,t1_fj8nwcs,1583129487.0,"Yeah! The thing people donâ€™t understand is that as parents of kids with autism we feel like we HAVE to explain, because society has created a world that makes anything that doesnâ€™t fit in with the social standards â€˜weirdâ€™ and â€˜awkwardâ€™ .. and people can be ignorant and rude, so you feel like you have to explain, and when you do explain people tone down the confusion and judgment .... a little anyway!"
unpopularopinion,fj7zua4,t1_fj7zp65,1583101950.0,I appreciate that! Thank you ðŸ™‚
unpopularopinion,fj7l7qe,t1_fj6digf,1583093121.0,"Well, as a parent to a child with autism, my eyes are never off my son, specially in public. I wouldnâ€™t have let him go into an section that wasnâ€™t for him, and if he has a meltdown about it, I would remove him from the situation and others and let him calm down (even if that is through aggression, and screaming- but away from others). 

Also, I find myself telling people that my son has autism too. But itâ€™s not an excuse, just an explanation for behaviour that other children or people may not understand, like why is he not responding? Why has he been circling round a tree for the last 15 minutes haha."
unpopularopinion,fj7kj1l,t3_fbr4gm,1583092866.0,"Oh my goodness I canâ€™t stand this. I have a son with autism. Albeit we have difficult behaviour that he canâ€™t always help. HOWEVER, as the years have gone by its become of upmost importance to me that during difficult situations/interactions etc etc and when things are clearly heating up and looking like it may not end well, I am straight away doing my best to soothe and support him AS WELL AS maintaining the behaviour to an extent that does NOT affect others. 

On the reverse though, what REALLY drives me insane is that I work my ass off to make sure my son isnâ€™t throwing a loud ass meltdown in front of you, or becoming aggressive towards you, or barging past you or all over your things, or saying anything rude etc etc etc .... (WHICH HE CANNOT REALLY CONTROL when he is having a sensory overload and it ISNâ€™T his fault that our society doesnâ€™t care or cater to the likes of people like him) whilst some parents of nuerotypical kids let them run wild, push past me and be an all over asshole kid. Grrr!"
raisedbynarcissists,fj3a53q,t1_fj399ep,1582975199.0,Exactly the same for me.
EDanonymemes,fiyvyda,t3_fakp8d,1582848192.0,Literally me.
AskReddit,fiykvtb,t1_fiykk5j,1582841394.0,"Ah that makes a lot of sense! Probably a very difficult combination within a â€˜loveâ€™ relationship. My son is autistic, if I try to imagine him dating someone with BPD that maybe hasnâ€™t found the right tools to be able to manage it properly .. I canâ€™t see how that would work out well! Thank you! :)"
AskReddit,fiyk6uv,t1_fiyjnx9,1582840993.0,"Thatâ€™s understandable! Itâ€™s pretty difficult to not generalise or feel the need to â€˜steer clearâ€™ of a certain type of situation/thing/place/people etc etc etc when youâ€™ve had a traumatic experience before. Just spreading the word that we arenâ€™t all that way, and those that are, might not always be (myself) :). Iâ€™m sure my boyfriend can vouch haha. We have far too many emotions, in our heads everything feels so extreme, we are genuinely good people with a lot of feelings, the problem is managing all of those feelings without dragging down those around us.. and managing irrational thoughts and feelings so we arent having to manipulate situations or people to try and get the feed back that will soothe those thoughts/feelings. Itâ€™s all very complex! itâ€™s hard work, but some of us can do it!"
AskReddit,fiyj7vg,t1_fiydyhc,1582840454.0,"Feeling attacked. Haha. Remember people, BPD (as with lots of things) can manifest in many different ways, and different severity levels. I was this girl in my younger days .. (no clue what BPD was) .. however now I understand myself much better Iâ€™m able to be proactive about my diagnosis. In a happy and pretty stable relationship. Heâ€™s supportive, and I push through my stuff even when itâ€™s difficult .. to ensure Iâ€™m not spiralling like cray and negatively affecting other people ..... also.... would never fuck a partners best friend .. just whoah."
BPD,fiybxuq,t3_fabnq4,1582836471.0,"Did I write this? Agh, life. Just, samesies. Itâ€™s hard!"
EDAnonymous,fiy2eew,t3_fael1a,1582831145.0,I was thinking that too! Someone send me mean messages constantly plsssssssss. Waaaaaaa.
raisedbynarcissists,fixxc7d,t3_fabt0w,1582828265.0,"Yup! Iâ€™m such a closed and shut off person. I can probably come across as very cold.. Iâ€™m not, I have BPD, I feel and have way too many extreme emotions. But from long I realised it was safer and easier for me to hide all my emotions, because my narc mother will use them against me EVERY TIME.. and it hurts, always feel so vulnerable after a let down like that."
BPD,fiwoh7v,t3_fa1imx,1582795181.0,This! I needed to read this. Thank you.
EDAnonymous,fiwoaft,t1_fiwlwt8,1582794909.0,"Oh trust me! Sometimes I donâ€™t, and sometimes it fails, which then in turn makes me feel the need to be more reclusive and cancel things!! I donâ€™t know why it felt so much easier when I was younger!!"
BPD,fiub8jp,t1_fiu8ync,1582738245.0,So so true. This means a lot. Thank you :)

EDAnonymous,fitiqgi,t3_f9iwz4,1582721303.0,"Yup! I always have to fast for minimum 2-3 days before any event, or any travelling, or even if like the boyfriend is coming over (lives an hour away) .. any family things etc. Sucks."
EDanonymemes,fitdh3g,t3_f9l0yz,1582715976.0,I feel this so much.
EDAnonymous,fita726,t3_f9izga,1582711699.0,So much yes! It affects my mood so much. I can be really happy and semi confident one moment because in a mirror glance I saw something kinda decent .. then Iâ€™ll look in a reflection or something an hour later and see something gross and then Iâ€™m all panicky and grumpy. People around me half the time are probably like wtf  .....
EDAnonymous,fit9qc5,t3_f9lqsp,1582711082.0,YES. All the YESâ€™s. From today no more ...... I hope.
