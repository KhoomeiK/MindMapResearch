Objectively speaking, you are not alone. 

Sometimes I make the comparison between depression and psychosis. Two completely different things, but they have an important tangent point: delusion. While a schizophreniac might be under the delusion the government is tapping his phone calls, someone who is depressed suffers from the delusion they are alone. 

You're not alone. You have friends and family. Ask yourself: 'Would I help them if it was the other way around?' In all probability you would do your utmost to ease their pain. So allow them to do that for you.

I was diagnosed almost 7 years to date, when I was 25 years old. Being BP sucks, it really does. But it's not a death sentence or anything. It's chronic, but manageable. But managing it takes a lot of energy. You have to go to your doctor, you have to remember to take your meds every day, and you have to try discover the best meds cocktail for you together with your psychiatrist. You have to replenish that exterted energy somehow, and leaning on the shoulders of loved ones does just that. They'll happily give some of theirs to you."

*When you're in a depressive episode, you don't remember what it feels like to feel good. You don't enjoy friends, family, social contact, birdsong in your yard, kids playing on the street etc. But when you get out of the depths, you don't really remember what it feels like to be depressed. You can hear the birds singing again and you wonder why you didn't before.*

Being bipolar doesn't mean feeling bad your entire life. You and me, we switch between dizzying heights and abysmal lows. But in between there's the baseline, where we find rest and contentment. Death takes that away as well. You won't be here anymore, the amazing potential you have inside of you would be gone from the world.

BipolarReddit,fiq4aik,t3_f8yhth,1582634639.0,"*What kind of relationship should I expect?*

First of all, there's no such thing as 'the bipolar'. Everyone of us is different. Some of us have comorbidities (e.g. personality disorders, ADHD...), some of us are never at the baseline mood-level while others are etc.

So I can mostly only speak for myself. My wife sees me as a kind and understanding person. I don't judge people's weaknesses. I don't make fun of people. My wife thinks that's partly due to my bipolar nature.

So if your girlfriend is somewhat like me, you'll get the absolute best of her when she's feeling good. Just make sure to return the favor by giving her the absolute best of you when she's not.

*Is there anything I can do for her during her depression periods? To make her feel better?*

In all probability there is nothing you can do. One of the possible causes of depression are biochemical imbalances in the brain. Since you can't inhibit the reuptake of the serotonine in her synaptic clefts, there's nothing you can do to make her feel better. The only thing that makes a difference is being there for her.  Listening when she wants to talk, and leaving her alone when she wants to be left alone.

*Anything I can do to try to prevent the depression?*

Yes and no. Help her manage her stress levels. This can be simple things like cleaning up your dirty socks, or helping her make a study or work planning.

*Is being alone really best for her?*

Sometimes, yes. As long as she knows that you'll be there when she doesn't want to be alone anymore.

*What I definitely shouldn't do?*

Don't elevate her stress levels, tell her stupid shit like 'count your blessings' or 'chin up'. Don't make her feel responsible for how she feels.

*Anything other I should know?*

Try to be understanding, but never imply that you know how she feels. You can't imagine it. Stay along the lines of: 'I can't imagine how shitty you feel, but know I'm here whenever you need me'.

Your relation has just as much potential as any other. Being bipolar doesn't define who she is, but remember it's part of her. Make sure she follows-up on her doctor's appointments and takes her meds. Don't make it controlling, but be mindful of it.

Something to remember: when she's stable, she'll be the best person in the world, more appreciative of life than anyone else you've ever met before."
