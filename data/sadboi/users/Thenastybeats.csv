Guitar,fp8ewj5,t1_fp7vmpv,1588390563.0,This is crazy difficult for me to do but I can see it being a great exercise. My brain just does not want me to move 1/3 and 2/4 together. I found if I actively apply a little pressure to the fingers not moving that it helps. Any other tips other than taking it slow and repetition?
musictherapy,fp0juf6,t1_fovyyg0,1588210709.0,"Thank you, those are great questions. I work in inpatient psych right now but plan to move to outpatient in the next few years and that's where I see myself long-term. I don't think I'll ever leave social work completely and would probably keep my license active even if I did go for MT licensure.

One of the things that I'd like to accomplish with getting an MT degree is widening my therapy tool kit and increasing marketability. But more than that, I've been a music student for most of my life and it's been a focal point of my journey. It's key to my philosophy and worldview. I'd love to learn how to share that and use it to encourage growth and insight in others. 

I talked with the coordinator at the program near me and he said it would be very difficult to do the bachelor's program part-time. He recommended some masters programs nearby that don't require you to have a bachelor's in music. It will probably be awhile before I'm able to go because of finances but it's nice to know that its a possibility. In the meantime, I'm hoping to find music-orientes trainings for clinicians that aren't MTs."
musictherapy,fopk0n1,t1_flznlqg,1587963538.0,Did you get your bachelor's in music prior to doing the equivalency program? I got my BS in psych and I have a masters in social work. I have a decent music background and was a few credits short of a minor in music. Just wondering if equivalency is only available for former music majors.
musictherapy,fopgkut,t1_fop771f,1587960942.0,"Awesome, thanks for all the insight. I would be looking to get a bachelor's most likely. I wish I could go for the equivalency but I didn't major in music the first time around and it sounds like most equivalency programs require that. The program near me also doesn't have it. 

The internship is a good point to consider that I had not thought about. I've already done two years of unpaid internships while working full-time, not sure if I'm ready to take that on again but who knows. Most bachelor's programs I've looked at have ensemble requirements but that makes sense for the masters to not have it. I have a lot of friends that did Music Ed for undergrad and it seems similar to that in how you're essentially a music major but focusing on therapy as well. Instead of having a teaching practicum you have the internship.

Anyways, lots for me to think about. I appreciate the feedback, expect a PM sometime with questions. Hope you're staying safe and healthy out there!"

socialwork,fkxki6q,t3_fh7t1i,1584630054.0,Psychiatric inpatient social worker here. I'm currently self quarantining due to symptoms and am preparing to get back at it. Our city/state like most areas is closing shelters and crisis beds. How do you ethically discharge someone that is homeless when they are psychiatrically stable with nowhere to go except the street? We need to open the beds for acute crisis cases and to clear space for general hospital beds. Anyone else dealing with this now and have thoughts?
mentalhealth,fkweb7c,t3_fl0977,1584590113.0,"We may not know what lies ahead, but we are capable of deciding how we want to live and feel in this moment. Our anxiety and depression try to take that choice away from us and I know how incredibly hard it can be to climb out of that fear-ridden black hole.

Guitar,fhixb5f,t3_f3hr7q,1581633703.0,"I can definitely relate to the feeling of starting too late, wasting all this time, and never being as good as you want to be. I got an acoustic when I was 15 and never got serious with it. I'm almost 30, bought my first electric a few months ago and am now playing every day. I often regret all those years of having a guitar and doing nothing with it, but I can't take back that lost time. I'm happy with where I'm at now and having a great time learning and playing.

I would ask yourself why you picked up a guitar in the first place. Was it to be the next Hendrix? To explore the great and mysterious art that is music? To impress others? To just have fun and jam? Whatever your motivations are (and your's sound solid), music is not meant to be a competition. It's great to listen, learn from, and emulate those that are more talented than us (even if they're younger), but in the end you're playing guitar for you. 

Also, you're young and very early in your journey so don't worry about never being as good as you wish. Sounds like you are throwing your soul into it, which is awesome and admirable. Enjoy it. Have fun.  Keep striving to be better but take away that pressure of needing to be at a certain level. You'll definitely get there if you keep at it."

guitarlessons,ffy26e2,t3_evugi6,1580337117.0,"Metronome keeps the beat. Not sure what you know about time signatures but most songs are in 4/4, meaning there are four beats and the beat is measured by a quarter note. So every beat of the metronome represents one quarter note for a song in 4/4.

Say you're practicing scales with eighth notes. That means you will play one note on every beat of the metronome and one note between each beat, or eight notes in a whole measure. The metronome helps you keep an even tempo. It's essentially like the drummer in a band. If you're playing a song by yourself, it can be hard to keep playing at the same tempo. Metronome keeps you in check.

For whatever you're working on, scales, songs, etc always start with the metronome at a slow tempo until you can play it perfect and then slowly move the speed up.

If you're working on specific songs, you can Google the tempo (eg 120 beats per minute or bpm) and work your way up to that speed."
mentalhealth,ffxpzhy,t3_evseso,1580330130.0,That's terrible that your high school  teacher and other supports are saying those kinds of things. Don't be so hard on yourself. There's so much more to life than math and any other high school class. School is not for everybody and just because you're not doing well with it does not make you a failure or mean that you're going to fail at life. There are plenty alternatives to traditional schooling. You just need to find what you're good at and what you enjoy. What kind of things are you into?
GetMotivated,ffx70e6,t3_evkrtj,1580319074.0,"Reminds me of the difference between joy and happiness, paraphrased from a Brene Brown book. Joy is living with a mindset of contentment that is not dependent on favorable conditions, and often results from practicing gratitude. Happiness is a momentary emotion experienced in response to a positive outcome."
guitarlessons,ffx6de4,t1_ffx2q3s,1580318698.0,"Not a theory expert so please add onto this if you can. It's good to know arpeggios because they are the foundation of all chords. When you are learning different modes and chord structures, its a lot easier to memorize arpeggios than full scales, but you should learn the scales too. The arpeggios often emphasize the defining notes of the scale, like flat third on a minor. 

The pentatonic scale is a lot easier to solo over because when you play on all six strings, there are only two notes per string. Again, definitely learn the whole scales because straight pentatonic solos can get bland if that's all you do. 

Learning the scales and arpeggios in the manner of this picture is nice because it is easier to visualize all of the intervals. Knowing the intervals allows you to apply this concept to any key signature and you also train your ear to know the difference between modes."

One program that I used to work at had a greenhouse and they had gardening groups which the clients loved. Even if you can't have an actual greenhouse, setting up house plants and having a schedule for clients to care for them could be nice. I like music groups (drumming, dancing, karaoke).

bipolar,ffqzhx4,t3_eur46s,1580147131.0,"Applied behavior analysis is a really effective treatment for people with autism spectrum disorders. I haven't heard of it being used much for bipolar. As far as I know, it's much more focused on recognizing and changing maladaptive behaviors. I don't think it would be that  helpful for what you are planning to work on unfortunately.

Have you tried calling your insurance customer service to get a list of other providers in your area? If you find someone that specializes in interpersonal or relational therapy that may be a better fit. Good luck! I know it can be really frustrating finding someone close that fits your needs and insurance."

mentalhealth,ffkc0eu,t3_etzqvh,1580020293.0,"Did they give you a prescription so you could keep taking the meds they were giving you? There's different types of anxiety meds, some that you need to take daily over a long period of time to get a therapeutic effect and others that are shorter acting that you take when anxiety flares up. Definitely get in to see a psychiatrist as soon as you can to discuss those options. Like someone else said, therapy is a great tool to figure out why you're anxious and what you can do to manage it. Meds aren't always necessary.

Since you can't get in with the doc immediately, do whatever you can to distract your mind from the anxiety. Listen to music, read a book, call a friend, go for a run, anything to get out of your head. Do something productive around the house. 

Another thing to try that can take some practice is tuning into your body and slowing things down. If you find your heart is beating fast, take a few minutes to breathe deeply into your belly. Breathe in for four counts, hold for four counts, and then out for four counts. Look up videos for Progressive Muscle Relaxation for some guided techniques. Anxiety can be as much physical as it is mental. It essentially activates our fight or flight response.

It can also help to question your thoughts. How serious and reality based are your concerns? Can you do anything to immediately change or improve the situation, and if so, what is keeping you from doing that? What is another, more positive way to look at the situation? If you're overwhelmed about something major, break it into smaller pieces and take little steps forward. Recognize when you are jumping to the worst possible outcome and remember that there are several other not terrible outcomes that may be more likely.

Most importantly, know that anxiety is just your mind playing tricks on you, and that it will pass. It will most likely come back because it happens to everybody, so practice these coping skills when you are well so that they come easier when you're not. And work with a doc for meds (if needed) and a therapist to develop more insight into what's going on and how you can grow. Good luck friend."

mentalhealth,ffk5ias,t3_eu0vib,1580016526.0,"It's not necessarily normal to feel this way but you're not alone. These thoughts are part of the human experience for a lot of people, unfortunately. Definitely talk with your therapist about it, they are there for this kind of conversation and will not have you committed unless you present as a danger to yourself. If you feel like you're in danger of hurting yourself now, though, please seek help. Most communities have a crisis hotline you can call to talk with a therapist and there is also the suicide hotline  1-800-273-8255. 

Remember that these types of thoughts and feelings, just like all thoughts and feelings, are temporary. They will pass. They may come back, but with time and proper treatment (therapy, maybe meds, developing healthier habits and coping skills) they become easier to manage. 

Carry on, friend. It's a tough road but the journey forward can be so fulfilling it if you give it a try."
