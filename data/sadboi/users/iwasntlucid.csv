Is it possible that your dad's anger is him feeling more helpless and pushing you away? Knowing you are his sole dependant, he knows you aren't selfish. These are things people in these situations say out of desperation. Please make time to care for yourself as well. I am an INFJ who cared for a chronically ill family member for close to a decade until they passed. It became my entire identity and was a dark time in my life. it is not a healthy situation but I had no choice either. Please know that what you're doing is a good thing that many cannot do.
