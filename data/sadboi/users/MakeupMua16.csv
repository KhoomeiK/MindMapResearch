relationships,fr5q24v,t1_fr5hh64,1589912743.0,Its like an pub type of restaurant but that also has a bar it’s hard to explain its a local chain they only have like 4 locations so it’s not like Applebee’s but kinda is. Maybe think of it as similar to an Irish restaurant/sports bar
Anxiety,fr535ni,t1_fr3xkz3,1589901668.0,Yeah that’s what I’m gonna do ask my doctor she deals with my psychiatry stuff too
Advice,fr3ub2q,t1_fr3tnzs,1589866476.0,Yeah your right I guess I can’t keep beating it around the bush if I actually want to know for sure where he stands with this.
insomnia,fr3u36o,t3_gmih82,1589866300.0,If you feel like you can’t sleep without it then I would talk to your doctor. You might have an underlying problem that they can give you something else that could be taken more long term.
relationship_advice,fr3tzsk,t1_fr3tvrv,1589866226.0,Yeah part of me feels like that might be what’s gonna happen but I guess I can only find out if I finally just ask what he wants to do and get a straight up answer once and for all.
NoStupidQuestions,fr3tr7f,t1_fr3tfu8,1589866032.0,"Yeah I’m definitely not gonna be with both if that happens I’ll definitely tel the other guy that I found someone else 

Say both wanna invite me over to their place and we end up cuddling (nothing further I promise!) is that still considered okay usually if I cuddled with both (separately obviously lol)?"
relationship_advice,fr3tnbd,t1_fr3ta1g,1589865945.0,Yeah I might have to say something like that. Maybe say like I’m trying to get things straight I know I’ve asked if you wanted to still do this but I’m still don’t know how you feel as to where we are at now and I don’t want to get a wrong impression and that it been already two months and if you want to make things official or just be friends so I know where we stand.
Advice,fr3tcly,t1_fr3soex,1589865711.0,So how exactly would I ask him? Should I say something like “okay we’ve been talking for about two months and now I’m curious as to where we stand and if you think we should make things official” or.... what would you recommend saying?
AskReddit,fr3r7ai,t3_gmhiv3,1589864068.0,"So I usually am on time and had a chiropractor appointment I was literally around the corner and the receptionist called like two minutes after the time I was supposed to be there said the whole thing about since your late we are going to have to charge you xyz fee and we can’t accept you to come in we are booked and do not have any time to fit you in now that you are late before I could even get a word in that I was literally around the corner. 

It was so stupid because I’ve been going to this chiropractor for a few months now and they are never super busy ever....and sometimes I have to wait like 5-10 minutes past my appointment time and last week they called to changed my appointment time on me in the same day twice to be seen and I get the whole thing about being respectful and not being late but one time being late not even 5 minutes and they get mad and won’t let me come in is a bit ridiculous!"
NoStupidQuestions,fr3nof8,t1_fr3nls9,1589861524.0,Yeah that’s a good thing but I’m still worried if even though it smells fine if it still could be bad
Frugal,fr3n5op,t1_fr3i6ya,1589861165.0,their burgers and fries are similar to Steak ‘n Shake

Frugal,fr3hpy4,t3_gmgfds,1589857658.0,Not free but the kids meals at Freddy’s are literally the same size as the regular and you get the same amount of fries too just upgrade your drink if you want a bigger size.

relationships,fr354tw,t1_fr33c2w,1589850144.0,"Ours was like almost an hour but maybe 45 minutes I don’t remember exactly. Also all we did was share an appetizer and didn’t order other food. And no we didn’t do anything after which was strange cause he said he wasn’t “busy” the rest of the day. But according to snapchat he went to another bar later that night. Which was fine just if he would of said that instead of lying saying he wasn’t busy the rest of the day unless he really did get asked to go last minute idk.

Also it’s not like he didn’t have fun because he did kiss me when he walked me to my car...?"
tanning,fr34p23,t1_fr341ic,1589849888.0,"That’s good it doesn’t run in your family! Also I’m not trying to sound mean about it just informing you so do whatever but my aunt unfortunately got skin cancer last year (thankfully it’s the most curable kind of skin cancer) and she used to tan a lot inside and outside and cancer doesn’t run in our family either. But if tanning helps you feel
Better about yourself and look better (I didn’t even know it helps cellulite good to know!) then I guess that’s fine if you want to do it."

KoreanFood,fr24oqo,t1_fr22lqa,1589831101.0,Yeah I might just go buy more to be on the safe side they don’t cost that much anyways. I was given some to try from my cousin who drinks them and she will be devastated she knew I left them out and had to throw them away 😬

AskReddit,fr1p1xk,t3_gm61ex,1589823531.0,Panic/anxiety attack. It was the worst and to top it off it was my first one and it happened on my birthday. Luckily I’ve learned how to cope with them now so I haven’t had one near as severe or as often anymore.
mlmstories,fr1o24k,t1_fr1mmpz,1589823049.0,Right I feel like that too it’s so annoying like I don’t wanna buy your fizzy sticks lol
relationship_advice,fqzuh9s,t1_fqzp91m,1589775688.0,Yeah true I should probably ask him if he wants to be exclusive or what’s going on
poppunkers,fqzocd5,t1_fqzgx8h,1589771664.0,Ik right but some people do drive more just right to get out of the house but don’t actually get out anywhere
relationship_advice,fqzob1i,t1_fqzlfwa,1589771640.0,We haven’t yet but last date before today he did mention meeting our parents soon after the virus is over so it seemed like he wants to stick around

relationship_advice,fqz58sp,t1_fqz3gfy,1589760152.0,I’ve met him like 5x before this but we’ve just walked the park or hungout at his place so far so it wasn’t the first time and he’s 25 I’m 26. yeah maybe he just wanted to see me as in he’s not ignoring me by not hanging out lately so he just wanted to hangout at least a little bit I don’t know
relationship_advice,fqz2hv8,t1_fqyzgxt,1589758737.0,Well I suggested we hangout again after we walked back to our cars then he hugged and gave me a kiss and that was it after that
relationship_advice,fqz29lg,t1_fqyzn4l,1589758622.0,Not yet we just literally just got done with it’s the date like an hour ago so I’m giving him a minute so I don’t sound like I’m being too clingy

And yeah I don’t wanna tell them now because if it didn’t work out my parents would forever be skeptical if I said I was going to my friends house and I really was but from then on they’d always think I’d be up to something with a guy or whatever. 

But I did tell my mom my friend wanted to go out to xyz (same place I’m actually going to but I’m going with a guy) and she just said ok sounds good"

DiagnoseMe,fqwaimd,t1_fqw9phl,1589697726.0,Yeah I’ve seen one in the past for other back issues and was told to do physical therapy which helped a little bit not much. I might have to make another appointment to see what she could do. I feel like this chiropractic stuff isn’t helping!

relationship_advice,fqw0s4p,t1_fqvztbx,1589689746.0,The leggings I wear though are more of the thicker kind so they look more like just stretch pants. Also I don’t have a decent pair of jeans and I can’t order any because of the corona and I’d like to actually try them on and no clothing stores are open beside Walmart and target rn and you still can’t try on stuff in store yet anyways which sucks

tinderstories,fqu2lvc,t1_fqtzm5v,1589650817.0,Yeah I’m definitely gonna ask him about it so I’m not left in the middle not knowing if I should move on or if it’s something else that’s going on not related to being together maybe a family problem or something and he still wants to be with me.

dating,fqsdqc8,t1_fqsdcin,1589604553.0,Yeah I feel like maybe now he’s just still messaging because he’s afraid to tell me he’s not interested anymore but I don’t know I’m just confused ugh!
NoStupidQuestions,fqsdnlx,t1_fqsdbam,1589604497.0,Yeah I’m not sure if it cost a lot or if insurance could help cover it since it is a health problem more than for cosmetics. Good luck!

relationship_advice,fqqdmda,t1_fqq64bg,1589563699.0,Yeah idk its just weird how he was so in to sending them all the time in the beginning but your right maybe his emotions changed and he actually is more reserved in using them now that we know each other more. Or maybe he wants to take things more slowly and thinks using them is going too fast I don’t know.
Esthetics,fqqdc5t,t1_fqqcfr2,1589563559.0,Yeah I do have the paper I may do that or I can maybe put the disposable bed cover over that
