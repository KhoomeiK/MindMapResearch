unpopularopinion,fojeg3w,t3_g7q6b8,1587818512.0,I have to mostly agree. I was one of those kids with not many friends and it was because I was so miserable and couldn‚Äôt see how others seemed to be perfectly happy and it made me angry and mean. I played the victim for such a long time but I‚Äôve realized that the reason I was so alone during middle/high school was because of myself. It took a long time to come to terms with that and to forgive myself.

MentalHealthSupport,fnmjycg,t3_g22rcg,1587072787.0,"I‚Äôm at a point in my life and mental health journey where I personally CAN‚ÄôT be there for someone else. I am focusing on bettering myself so that in the future, I CAN be someone to lean on. I would never cut someone off if they chose to confide in me, but I also don‚Äôt go around telling people that I‚Äôm ‚Äúalways here‚Äù when I really can‚Äôt be. That being said, I am also not the type of person who goes to others to vent unless you catch me in the moment (if I start crying or have some kind of an episode)."
BPD,fmwyp0m,t1_fmwy9q8,1586455361.0,"I wouldn‚Äôt say I lie about any little thing, but I do lie a lot about my feelings because of shame/ guilt/fear. But otherwise I try to be honest. The thing that sucks is usually later on I feel/think about a subject completely differently than before so it feels like I lied or someone may bring attention to it if they notice and say that I lied or am lying. But I wasn‚Äôt in the moment. :/"
BPD,fmwxzp7,t3_fxwyjb,1586455011.0,"I feel you. I‚Äôm not reckless with money, I don‚Äôt drink or do drugs in excess (at least I don‚Äôt think so), I don‚Äôt cheat on my partner, don‚Äôt get violent or intentionally manipulate people either. But I think what it really boils down to is stereotypes about this disorder. There are so many ways it manifests and is expressed, and when someone experiences it differently than what is stereotypical, all of a sudden they don‚Äôt have that disorder. Which is just wrong. I invalidate myself enough already, I don‚Äôt need others to do it too. Just know you‚Äôre not alone!"
BPD,fmsrdzm,t3_fx7zl4,1586360788.0,"I wish I had an answer for you. I‚Äôve been feeling this way for the past couple of days and I don‚Äôt think my husband has even noticed. That doesn‚Äôt help me much. It‚Äôs hard to bring yourself out of something like this when you literally have no interest in anything. Just don‚Äôt get down on yourself for feeling this way. Know that it will end, as our emotions fluctuate. Ride it out. I don‚Äôt know many tricks, but if you‚Äôre disassociating real bad try focusing on your surroundings and senses (smelling something strong or happy, taking a hot/cold bath, things like that). Doing those kinds of things sometimes brings me out of my head."

unpopularopinion,fmco2ra,t3_fubmcu,1585949415.0,"I don‚Äôt know if someone else has already said this, but I think that in some movies/shows there is a point in showing sex scenes. Like in any coming-of-age story, oftentimes sex scenes are included because this is a new experience, and as long as the characters are of age then I don‚Äôt mind seeing it, as it‚Äôs kind of character development. These are usually made to be awkward on purpose. Or any kind of show where the story is about an individual (especially if the story is about them struggling with sex/feelings/navigating love). If a sex scene is shown, it‚Äôs usually because there‚Äôs now new meaning because of the act itself (lovemaking instead of just banging). It may seem pointless and uncomfortable, and I agree that sex scenes aren‚Äôt always needed, but they definitely can add something to the story in my opinion."
