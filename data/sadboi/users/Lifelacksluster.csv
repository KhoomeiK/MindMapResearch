That, like all arrogant fools, he was greater than he truly was.

Even when the Ring is destroyed Sauron endures, little more than a shadow of evil, I gather. Much, I think, like he was when his body was destroyed and Isildur took the ring. Saruman too, survived his body's death. Sauron, still returned to Middle Earth as the eye, not believing it to be because the ring still existed but simply because he was Him. Lord Sauron, the Dark Lord.

Had he known the One existed still, wouldn't all his resources be spent on finding the Ring? He knew that it's power would make him that much stronger, strong enough to overcome the lady of the woods, Gondor and all those who resisted his domain. So I think, no. No, he didn't know the ring existed until little before Gandalf pointed out that he now knew. And yes, yes he knew that the ring was tied to his power. But I believe until then he either was not aware or did not believe to what extent. He was resigned to it being lost, destroyed by the elves. He had managed to survive it's ""destruction"", so perhaps he didn't think much of it anymore. But after, did he knew then how much he depended on the ring? 

Perhaps. Perhaps, it is why much of his resources were used to try and find the little hobbit that carried it.

The Dark Lords of Middle Earth were not often very wise, just exceedingly proud. It is how a beautiful elvish woman took a *Silmarilli* from the crown of an sleeping Morgoth. She took advantage of his arrogance and he let his guard down. If either him, his servant Mairon, or his own servant Curunír understood the world and were wise. Then neither of them would be Dark, I think Tolkien has implied that before. After all, Saruman's death is picture-perfect of how arrogantly superior they would think themselves to be, only to be killed by a servant when their back was turned."

Try with ""A soft answer turns away wrath; but grievous words stir up anger"" Proverbs 15. 

Fun thing to do when arguing with a fundamentalist is to speak their language. It makes them go nuts. Only reason why I know the Bible, truth be told. Like I read the Quran too, way back when. If there's a dogma you can use it against them just as well as they can against you. Better even. They may swear on the bible but rare is the person who actually reads it."

Not a Dem. Unaffiliated. But Republican President in the White House.

>Trump was the fastest to react

Nope. Even in the US Trump followed the example of Gavin Newsom, who first declared State of Emergency, February. Trump followed in March 13. After that it had ravaged Italy, and also followed Iran, of all places.

>bloody murder at every step, no less.

Not murder. Manslaughter. By Trump no less. Other countries have fewer cases than the US. It is no accident. 

>Chinese government and their lap-dog the WHO had been lying for MONTHS.

This is interesting. 

Has this been 1968, when a pandemic of H3 began in the US. Who would you have blamed?

>95% of world-wide suffering

Hyperbolic data out of own opinion, subjective idea given a number and thrown out in ignorance. No backing from sources of any kind, insulting to all who has some problem beyond Corona.

>Wuhan Flu.

1. Not a flu.
2. Name's Coronavirus. Might as well use it, it'll kill you either way.

>Chinese government and their lap-dog the WHO had been lying for MONTHS.

Trump Downplayed this for MONTHS, as well. He has been lying for four years, saying something then going 180° the next month. He did say it will go away in April; mid April. No miracle."

And yeah, to my opinion, naturalized people should be allowed a vote if anything, them being in the US legally should speak some of their education, know a man born abroad, personally, he studied petroleum engineering. And he did pretty well for himself... there might be many, and as long as he does good for the States... well... this might be too controversial. So feel free to disregard it if you disagree. The focus should be elsewhere. 

Here, as a matter of fact, that as important part  people should be educated enough to be allowed a vote... sadly, that cannot be done without stepping on liberties and causing Bethlehem to erupt. But in the future education should be more important than it is now, but I don't see any politician focusing on basic education, college is a privilege, those that should vote should be educated for it in youth. Middle school, High school. No party that I know of focuses on this. With Trump's wall the whole idea is on who should be out. With no focus on who is already in."

Late introduced ammendments happened, but for instance when Slaves where freed a civil war followed. Is fanaticism the reason? It seems to me that whether it is the Bible or the Unchanged Constitution, they serve as the Qur'an does for the Jihadists; as a creed to spill blood.

And even if that were all well and good, pandemics have in the past stretched countries, kingdoms, societies to their limits, add a good civil war to the middle of it and well, what hope would there be for the states to remain united?"

A single nation cannot be blamed for a pandemic, it does not involve those nations alone. China may be hiding numbers... and even if it can be traced back to them... What then? What kind of prosecution do you want to do against President Xi? We all know that whatever judicial actions are taken against the government will affect the chinese national first and him second. 

As for ""turn China into a Democracy""? That may depend on factors that go beyond a single video, or the desires of the many... not in our lifetimes, perhaps.

Nations should focus first and foremost on surviving this plague... so should people.

I can name many more things that went wrong with the battle against Coronavirus than just the actions of China. The actions of the US Government leave much to be desired. Misleading."

They truly should declare martial law and keep people in... India still has the Bubonic plague. Out of being ineffective at combating it, I think.

 As for economy the government should, if it were at all capable, subsidiate small businesses so that those who have no money could get paid leave. Far from ideal but it might calm the people."
