Which is fine. I mean Beyonce could never do what Taylor does either. I guess my point is that Taylor shines when she plays an instrument and when the music is very minimal. You can see her enjoy performing more that way and her vocals are better too. It feels more intimate, even when it isn't"

I've actually read that there's a biological explanation for this, but I don't remember what it was. I think it had something to do with high cortisol levels. This person advised a morning workout to combat the feeling. If only I had the energy, lol.

LA does seem to be very focused on appearance. Everyone around you just seems perfect. We, as humans, tend to compare ourselves to others when it comes to things we are insecure about. So if you feel insecure about your skin or your lips, you'll probably compare yourself to the girls that have the skin or lips that you want. Not paying attention to all the things that you have that they don't have. Don't know if I'm making sense, lol."

I'm so tired of every single big celebrity in Hollywood acting 'woke'. I loved Ricky Gervais speech at the Golden Globes where he poked fun at celebrities for acting that way. It's not new. But you'll rarely find a celebrity saying something the mainstream media (except for Foxnews) wouldn't agree with. Which makes me wonder first and foremost how authentic the political sentiment is, but also what the additional value of going political actually is."

TaylorSwift,fgfvhjy,t1_fgc3ois,1580748508.0,"The fact that you're getting so angry about this, just shows that I should probably stop talking right now. You're such a Swiftie that you can't even hear anything negative about Taylor. I'm not changing my argument, I'm still thinking it sounds inauthentic BECAUSE the documentary only touches the surface of her reasoning. It's fine, and (as I've said before) I enjoyed the documentary, but to call it her political awakening is a little too much. It felt more like a summary of somethings that have happened to her in the last couple of years.

 She doesn't need to do or prove anything, that's not my point. I also don't think she's 'lying'. I get that she would be afraid that what happened to the Dixie Chicks would also happen to her. That's a legitimate fear, but she doesn't need to blame her father or anyone else for it."
TaylorSwift,fgbsra0,t1_fg8h5te,1580665768.0,"You're exaggerating. It's not about winning or losing, I enjoyed the documentary, but with the promotion and all I feel like it could have been a little deeper. If Taylor was genuinely afraid, that's fine. It'd be cool if she'd just talk about that. How did that feel? What were some moments where she wanted to speak out (except for the Trump election) but chose not to?


Now it kind of sounds like she's blaming someone else for not speaking up herself. I think that's why some non-fans think that Taylor is always playing the victim. I don't agree with the sentiment, but I do think she very rarely says that she didn't do the right thing when she's called out for something. It's always because of someone else."
TaylorSwift,fg59de0,t3_ewyp29,1580521579.0,"I honestly didn't even realize that that's what she said. I don't know, but I'm pretty sure that her parents are separated.

TaylorSwift,fg58vw2,t1_fg56vk3,1580521221.0,"Do you have a link to that? Because I saw the original video of what was in the documentary and it didn't sound spiteful.

TaylorSwift,fg4kzzg,t1_fg4db41,1580505453.0,"I honestly don't expect anyone on this subreddit to share my opinion on this matter. It's just how I genuinely feel. I like Taylor's music. I even like her as a person from what I can tell. I just don't like her going political. It doesn't feel authentic. I feel like, even with this documentary, she is still trying to please others. She's still trying to repair the damage that was done to her image in 2016. She's still doing what people expect her to do: speak up against Trump.

If she wants to go political, I feel she should be more honest. She was born into privilege, she never had to worry about her future for a single day. I would've loved it if she would talk about these things and explain what she thinks is going wrong in America. I'd like her to talk about how things could be better. 

And I don't buy it that she didn't go political before because she was told not to. Back when she was still signed under BMR she used to speak about things her label advised against and how she fought to get it done (Speak Now as an album title comes to mind, or 1989 being a pop-album). Now we're supposed to believe that she wanted to talk about gay-rights during her entire career, but didn't because she wasn't allowed to. Didn't she sign a contract with BMR because it would give her the right to write her own songs and have a say in her own career? I'm sure they advised against her going political, but had she wanted to do it, she could've. She didn't do it because A. her political views weren't democratic and she was afraid that she wouldn't appeal to pop-audiences or B: her political views weren't republican and she was afraid to lose her country-princess appeal."
TaylorSwift,fg48cta,t1_fg2yni8,1580498305.0,"Agreed. I think it's an unpopular opinion but I still don't feel comfortable with Taylor going political. I honestly feel like she's not very good at it.
