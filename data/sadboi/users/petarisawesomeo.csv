I typically explain to them that this boxes you in way too much and creates a lot of stress if you figure out that you don’t like it or aren’t good enough to progress, but you feel like this is what you have to do. OP you do need to have some skin in the game and be willing to take some risks. What are things that you are interested in either personally or professionally and what kind of work opportunities might be available to get some exposure to these topics? If you find something are you willing to take the risk and try something new or work for less pay maybe in the short term? Are you willing to take a chance knowing you might fail? This can create a lot of anxiety too, but the alternative is that you are a barista forever and never experience professional experience. Also, never worry about needing to have your career fully figured out by a certain age. Plenty of people have had to completely reinvent themselves professionally in their 30s, 40s, 50s, etc. and are the better off for it"
