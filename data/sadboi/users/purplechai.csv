AskDocs,fqq3m5h,t3_gk8hss,1589558822.0,"I'm NAD, but one of the comments below is from a doctor who mentioned health anxiety. While it might be hard to believe, it might be something to consider. I experienced severe health anxiety 1-2 years ago, and it truly made me feel that I had every possible disease in the book (cancer, brain tumor, MS, etc.). You become aware of every change your body makes, no matter how minor. 

I'm going to suggest that you STOP LOOKING AT YOUR HEART RATE MONITOR. Watching how much your heart rate fluctuates is only going to increase your anxiety. Take your watch off for a few days, and see if that helps. When my anxiety was at its highest, my resting heart rate was between 110-115. And yes, as someone who also takes Adderall, it can affect your heart rate/anxiety. 

Some of your other symptoms (numbness/tingling, distorted vision, gastrointestinal issues, etc.) can also, unfortunately, be related to anxiety. When I have a panic attack or just intense anxiety, it feels like a stroke (I also get the numbness/tingling, vision issues, etc.). 

Look, if you feel the need to go to a doctor and have tests ran, even if it's just to ease your mind, then go for it. Yes, it *could* be something serious, but also try to understand that anxiety can manifest as other conditions, and can really fuck around with your mind. Stop watching your heart rate, don't google your symptoms (the WORST thing you can possibly do), and if anything, schedule an appointment with your doctor. Best of luck, and I hope you get an answer soon."

HealthAnxiety,fqdxxfb,t3_gicrxt,1589298509.0,"Depends on the kind of medication, dosage, etc. List of what I take and how it affects me:

**Lamictal (Bipolar Disorder):** it's my mood stabilizer, but I don't have any side effects from it. Best thing I could have ever started taking.   
**Buspar (GAD):** this is what I take long-term for anxiety. I have no side effects from it, although when I take it, for the first 15-20 minutes it gives me a bit of sensory overload, and everything seems brighter. Otherwise, I am fine.   
**Adderall (ADHD):** helps me focus throughout the day, but the come down sometimes causes me to have anxiety. The first time I took it I had physical symptoms (heart palpitations, chest tightness, etc.) but for some reason this time I seem to be okay.   
**Ativan (GAD):** as needed for anxiety, mostly for sleep and panic attacks. Yes, when you take this is can almost feel like a high, and I notice that I have a hard time remembering what I did during the time I took it. I try not to take it every day because the withdrawal can be bad, and I really don't want to become too dependent on it. 

Other medications I have taken - **Latuda, Zyprexa, Risperdal** (antipsychotics). If anything I had a worse experience with Risperdal (made me feel very blunted, tired, and I felt like I couldn't remember anything when I took it). The nice thing is that antipsychotics (except for Latuda) typically knock me out. 

This is just my experience with certain medications. Honestly, idk where I would be without them, and don't know how I survived without them. It doesn't hurt to try, but it will take time to find the type and dose that works for you."

Since this COVID-19 shit I haven't  really slept that well, I'm constantly in a panic, and I'm so terrified that me or someone I know is going to get the virus. I'm the one who does the food shopping so once a week I have to go out, and every time I put my mask on I feel an anxiety attack come on. I get nervous when the stores have nothing on the shelves (big problem in my area), and I have essential works in my family who have to go out to work (my dad is one of them, oh and he smokes, which makes me even *more* paranoid if he were to get the virus). 

I live in New Jersey where I feel the cases and deaths are constantly going up, and since it was nice yesterday, I felt that more people were out. I'm torn between wanting to know what's going on, and being scared shitless every time I watch the news. Normal as we know it is gone, and as much as my mom tries to convince me it's not, I truly feel it is. I know people are recovering (wish they reported on this more), but I still don't feel very optimistic. 

I've tried everything in my power to calm myself on my own, everything from what I learned in DBT last year, to using my DBT workbook, but it's not working and I can't get my mind to shut off. Going to sleep is a bitch - as I fall asleep I wake up in a panic, shaking and sweating, and once I go to sleep, I don't stay asleep. I didn't want to ask for Ativan, but I didn't know what else to do. I'm working from home so I need to sleep and calm myself somewhat. 

Everything just feels so strange right now. It feels like I'm in a movie, and I still have a hard time believing I need to wear a mask and gloves wherever I go, wait in line before going into a store. I'm just so dumbfounded. And, idk if others with an anxiety disorder feel the same way."

This. I've been watching No Reservations because it's been running on the Ovation channel, and I still have some Parts Unknown on my DVR. I miss him terribly. But, I feel like he has hard shoes to fill - there was something about how he presented different foods and cultures, he had that compassion and wittiness about him. Yes, someone needs to pick up where he left off, but I think it'll be different."

I... what? He seriously did this? How the hell can you do something like that? I don't find him that likable recently but this is just ridiculous."

jobs,ff7xza2,t1_ff7jgff,1579661028.0,"I've had other jobs where I've worked late before, but the difference is I either got paid overtime for it, or it wasn't expected - it was the worker's choice if they wanted to stay late. But with this job, it's expected of everyone to stay late pretty much every night. I'm in the process of looking for another job because of other reasons, and I'm hoping to find something where the manager has maybe a different mindset."
jobs,ff7hpit,t1_ff7ha15,1579649806.0,"My manager has made it a point to say things like you’re not dedicated enough if you don’t stay late. I think it’s because my supervisor is always staying late, but he doesn’t do anything during the day. He’s either reading articles, doodling, or on his phone. Everyone else works without an issue. He works until 10pm so he expects everyone else to."
