Anxiety,f31j444,t3_df64fq,1570576707.0,"Hi! I too have anxiety, but itâ€™s impulses to wash my hands or use hand sanitizer. What I decided I could try doing was if I felt the need to use hand sanitizer or wash my hands, I would wait x number of minutes before doing so, hoping the urge would pass. Perhaps you could try this too? Finish eating and wait 5-10 minutes to see if you are still hungry before buying."
Anxiety,f31ia1k,t3_dek2lo,1570576095.0,YOU ARE AWESOME! Seriously congratulations. That is such a huge step!!
