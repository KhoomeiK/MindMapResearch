Psychosis,fk8m75l,t3_fgr9yv,1583958700.0,"I think the most important thing is to remember that some people just don't understand because they haven't had any experience with it before. That doesn't make them a bar person or mean they aren't trying. They may just not know what to do or say. I have a friend that was there for me and helped me a lot when I was going through psychosis, but I when it became too much, he told me he couldn't talk to me that often about it (I had been bombarding him with paranoid texts that didn't make much sense). I was hurt at first because I don't have a lot of friends and I needed someone to talk to. But I understand that we're both only 21 and he's dealing with his own life and just can't always be there for everything I need, and he definitely just doesn't know how 5o respond sometimes. I wouldn't either if I was in his place."
Psychosis,fk8jrha,t3_fh1xsf,1583957371.0,"When I had psychosis I was very paranoid about people being *thinking* I was going to hurt them. People were worried about me because it was clear there was something wrong, but all I could see was people seeming suspicious of me for no apparent reason. It took a friend listing reasons people around me were worried for me to realise anything other than really bad depression was happening, and even then it took months for me to get all the way better and realise how warped my perception of reality had become. If you really don't ever want to hurt anyone, it's not something that is likely to happen. I do get extremely angry when in psychosis and having passing thoughts of hurting someone occasionally, but that's all it is. Just a passing thought. I've only ever physically harmed myself. If you ever think you might hurt someone for any reason, just remove yourself from the situation as quickly as possible until you can calm down."
schizoaffective,fk8j0sc,t3_fh2g5i,1583956964.0,"I know I follow a lot of rules of superstitions that I don't actually believe in. And there are things that I remember happening when I was young that was obviously a dream or my imagination but it feels so real I can't help but believe they were real somewhat. I think everyone has things like that. As far as things I believed during psychosis, I was super paranoid and thought a lot of crazy things were happening. But at the same time I knew at least some of it was crazy so I wouldn't let myself fully believe it until I had proof. The problem was that ordinary things kept seeming like evidence but not quite proof of the things I believed being true."
