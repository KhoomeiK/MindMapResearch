I'd get overly attached to a male mentor figure, for example teachers and classmates who were friendly, supportive, and kind to me. They'd be all I can think about for months. I'd read into every little thing they did and attach meaning to it. I'd both love and hate interacting with them. I'd panic so badly I could barely function, and then later I'd replay it over and over. And like you I'd fantasize about being their son/husband/best friend, what it'd be like and what we'd talk about. Meanwhile they were very unaware of what was going on. It felt like a manic-depressive roller coaster, I'd feel extremely depressed and extremely happy depending on what happened, or what I perceived to happen, between us.

offmychest,fm8r3iq,t3_ftk5rg,1585854449.0,"Thank you for sharing this. Firstly, admitting you have a personal problem, even anonymously can be terrifying, which I hate. But that's the way it is. You're not a bad, disgusting, or crazy person, not at all. The fact that you're admitting it's wrong and trying to get help proves that. Everyone does bad things but not everyone is a bad person. What's important is that they recognize what they did was bad and try to improve. Also, having unhealthy and obsessive infatuations isn't uncommon, and actually I just learned that there's a word for it (limerence). And from reading about it, I've had some before. So it's not just you.

Secondly, I just wanted to say it's normal to be anxious when starting therapy. I was also nervous for my first appointment, but it turned out to be much less scary than I thought. Don't be scared of weirding your therapist out. Their job is to help you, not to judge you, and I guarantee you they've seen much stranger things. Just describe why your there. This post is actually very well written, so if you'd like you can just show it to them. If they judge you then they're not a good therapist. Likewise not all therapists are good, and if after several sessions you don't feel like it's working, try discussing it with them and figuring out what isn't working and what would work better. They shouldn't get offended. If that doesn't help, try another therapist. People rarely get the ""right"" one their first time. I say all this because I thought I was doing something wrong with my first few therapists. Nope, they just didn't fit me. Each one has a different style and will click with different people. I hope this wasn't too long and was helpful. What you're doing is admirable. Good luck :)"

Enough_Sanders_Spam,fl8slqt,t3_fmvxvv,1584931284.0,"I found a video of Biden [talking about his stutter](https://youtu.be/iWn1CkIU_rc), and I could really relate to it. I have a stutter, and it feels isolating at times. It isn't terrible, but I completely get why he talks the way he does. I get angry when I see people claim he has dementia, not just because there's no way of knowing that from a video, but because they don't understand how much stuttering can affect your behavior.

You get tense and anxious before you talk. Worrying over stuttering ironically makes a stutter worse. You try to rephrase things to avoid using certain sounds that trip you up, but it's hard to do that on the fly while your mind is panicking, and sometimes you end up using weird or mixed up phrasing (\*cough\* that's probably the reason for Biden's slip ups, not dementia \*cough*\). After you stutter, you convince yourself they think you're dumb or creepy. You interpret any little shift in body language as them being annoyed with you. Later you replay the incident over and over, reminding yourself of how embarrassing it was. Eventually, you might just avoid speaking out of fear, convincing yourself that what you want to say would be unfunny or dumb anyway. You fade into the background, but you also stutter less and feel more relaxed, so the isolation reinforces itself. 

Biden's right when he said stuttering is the only handicap that's socially acceptable to make fun of. I guess because it's not physical and it seems trivial to some people. But it's not. It plays tricks on your mind and can really mess you up. And I agreed so much with his points at the end, which was to never mock someone based on something they can't control, and to treat others like humans even if you don't like them. There's so much hate and cruelty out there (especially online), it's like people forgot how to be decent. 

I have a few reservations for some of Biden's past actions, but no candidate is perfect, and that video raised my respect for him by a lot. He mentioned how personally talks with other kids who stutter and inspires them to not let it define them. That can make a huge difference to a young lonely stutterer. To me, that shows he really empathizes with others.

Sorry, this ended up being way too rambly. That video spoke to me on a personal level I guess."
