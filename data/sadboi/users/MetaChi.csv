millionairemakers,fqsy7id,t3_gkjiqo,1589623261.0,Ok
ottawa,fqnheqr,t1_fqnfs9p,1589494895.0,Im really sorry that people being so nasty to you. Its the opposite of what a Canadian should be. I hope you are aren't endangering yourself because of it.
TeamSolomid,fqfxrwx,t1_fqfws9s,1589333812.0,"Yes, she is not the owner of TSM or the GM of the league team so you can always say that she didn't make that decision. But the leaked conversation about dardoch and her taking credit atleast in part for multiple TSM roster decisions seems to suggest that she has some power when it comes to making decisions. I agree she likely doesn't have the final say, but that doesn't mean she has no power at all"
TeamSolomid,fqfva1h,t1_fqfv3vd,1589332382.0,She herself said she was responsible for the biofrost pickup. She may not directly make the decisions but she 100% gives meaningful input that impacts the team and is likely included in all discussions relating to the team
TeamSolomid,fqfv2n5,t1_fqfurp4,1589332266.0,"But that is a lie, she herself has said that she is responsible for the biofrost pickup. She may not make the final decisions, but she without a doubt gives meaningful input that has impacted decisions relating to the league team roster."
TeamSolomid,fqfukme,t1_fqfu4lj,1589331982.0,"Yeah, I guess I'm still deciding how unacceptable their actions have been. But, don't worry I understand some people will act like 12 year olds and flame/downvote me. This is the TSM subreddit after all I don't expect people to cheer me on for questioning my faith xd"
TeamSolomid,fqfubon,t1_fqftzcs,1589331843.0,"That is a good point, but the fact that they were so reckless makes me think they may be worse than the typical. At the end of the day, I can only use the information I have and I don't think its fair to assume all teams are shady"
TeamSolomid,fqfu40c,t1_fqftxtz,1589331721.0,Regi says that but that's contradicted but why Leena herself has said. She was even recently thanked by an owner for the transfer of Kobbe. Plus we literally just heard her talking about nobody wanting to take Dardoch...doesn't sound like she's separate from the league team to me
TeamSolomid,fqftwmp,t1_fqftpv0,1589331608.0,"Haha, it does hurt when I've stuck with this team through thick and thin and they are unable to treat what we the fans have given them respectfully."

TeamSolomid,fp1c1y7,t1_fp08z7z,1588230589.0,"Idk if speculating that someone has a mental disorder or condition to the point of needing professional help is wise, especially as a first responder. I get we are discussing potential roster moves, but this is kinda crossing a line for no reason. We lost the spring split of NALCS, and all Ive heard is that dd has been self-improving over the years. Not sure it makes much sense to start speculating about a psychotic break just yet."

todayilearned,ffkqsdg,t1_ffkcude,1580027255.0,Exploiting other people for fun is not moral. These people are under the influence and likely have mental issues or trauma thats led them down their path to being homeless in the first place. How can you think this is ok? Im really concerned how you can possibly equate these two. Maybe lets treat them with kindness and get them back in the right track instead of treating them like animals.
