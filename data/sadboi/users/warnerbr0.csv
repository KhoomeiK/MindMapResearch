pokemon,ffvbzdw,t1_ffv71vj,1580260541.0,"-missed the point of being labelled an mmo
-then completely changes mmo argument

-route length and battles I suppose is personal preference so I did come off a bit harsh on that. But temtem battling is a core game mechanic so it seems silly to say theres too much battling imo.

-Ok sure, it gives kickstarter ppl an early advantage and is technically p2w. But you can breed 3/7 perfect SVs very easily, and it saves only a few hours time breeding. It's a 1x thing to a very select group, I dont see that as a valid complaint (and no I'm not a kickstarter) 

-your competitive critique of only a handful of viable TemTem is probably true, and will hopefully grow over time. But again completely different from your original argument. rng is widely viewed as bad in a competitive setting because it means someone can just get a lucky win in over skill. 

Game devs should be very selective about what criticism they take to heart imo. If they cater too much to every little thing then it can just end up making things worse.

I'm not hating on all criticism, I'm just hating on bad/unwarranted criticism."
pokemon,ffv0emf,t1_ffalad4,1580252840.0,"You have some very strange critiques of this game.

\-What does it matter if it's labelled an MMO or not? The MMO genre nowadays has been stretched across many different styles of games, and some of TemTem's online features are still in development.

\-There is an EXP share, called the 'cowards cloak'. The routes being long is incredible and gives more gameplay and more to explore. I can't even believe that's a critique.

\-I assure you a 3 perfect SV Luma is still not competitive. Many people have already bred perfect Temtems. There is no 'pay2win' aspect of this game.

\-The lack of RNG is AMAZING for competitive play. There are ways around sleep status, its not a catch-all strategy, nor is it as broken as it is in Pokemon.

Temtem does have some issues, but your arguments come across as hating on Temtem just to hate on it."

We are harsher to ourselves because we have a constant log of everything we have ever done in our mind. 

Some things that have been helping me:
1. Forgive yourself
 No ones perfect and everyone makes mistakes including you. You need to be able to forgive yourself for your mistakes to move past them. I have found how you react to failure is more important than the failure itself.
2. Would you say it to a friend or someone you care about? Treat yourself as someone you care about and when you find yourself saying something harsh, stop yourself!
