Anxiety,fpsgg6k,t3_gdwcei,1588873052.0,"I can relate to this 100%. 
I have extreme adhd and certain noises or even certain fabrics on clothes and I CANNOT focus on anything else. I have the same issue with emotions and if I am worked up about something (I also have anxiety) it’s hard for me to shift my focus on anything else. 

IE.. someone at work was eating chips and I’ll was trying to have a convo with someone else and I could focus on the conversation at all because all I could pay attention to was the crinkling of the chip bag."
