BPDlovedones,fob856t,t3_g6jeg0,1587657112.0,"We broke up months months ago, we had a nasty fall out in February. Wasn't in contact, then she reached out sometime around the end of last month. She told me that the breakdown of our relationship wasn't all my fault, we both contributed to it. We both tried to rebuild our friendship.  I  thought we were doing good, we wasn't arguing,  I  wasn't being ""mean"", and she sent me a lengthy text in the middle of the night (early morning of her bday)  basically said how she didn't want this anymore, she wasn't happy.  I  don't know why  I  still miss her, we had plenty of happy moments but the few bad moments started to overshadow the good.  Imo the good overweighed the bad, the few bad moments were colossal.   I  just don't know"
