I have yet to make it in to actually talk to someone, but after struggling my whole life and labelling myself with depression and GAD, i still felt like something didn't quite fit.

After researching BPD I feel like I relate to 99% of the symptoms, and even without an official diagnosis it's brought a lot of clarity to my thoughts and emotions. 

It helped me to understand the symptoms etc explained online by writing them down and then writing about whether or not it applied to my life and how.

Hoping someone who has gone through the diagnosis process has something useful to add!"
BPDrecovery,falyiw0,t3_e9v1yo,1576192664.0,"I went through this over a year ago.

I'll admit I held on to a lot of unhealthy habits that didn't help (too much distraction from friends/alcohol etc). 

I did find journaling helped. Writing those letters that you never send as well.
I read the book 10% Happier by Dan Harris, which helped me to accept and understand my feelings, rather than trying to suppress or fight them. 
I also tried to replace my unhealthy coping mechanisms with healtheir ones (mainly exercise)

I'm not going to lie, 18 months later it's still hard to think about. I don't think that will ever change, but it's almost never a trigger for me anymore. It's still a sad/uncomfortable part of my life to dwell on, but I've definitely become better since. I am more aware of my emotions and how I affect people around me. 

Everyone kept telling me it would just take time, and it does, but try to fill that time with healthy habits mentally and physically.
