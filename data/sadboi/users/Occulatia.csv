How does it benefit him at all to say ""I'm going to donate to a Jewish anti-defamation charity"" and then renege on that after people show that they're scummy. MSM will just use that to their narrative and paint him and his fans as anti-Semitic as they did in the past over even more minute things.  

To be honest, he doesn't really need marketing stunts at least not ones that have the potential to be so controversial. He's the biggest online personality out there with 100x times more fans than the people who write smear articles. Yeah sure he wants to clear his name but there's so many other charities or ways he could have gone about it. Seems more like a simple mistake of not researching the charity he was suggested to donate too, a mistake which he apologized for and wants to fix. All this has done is create more drama for him and he's not the kind of YouTuber that thrives on that."

Steven has a track record of being a manipulative lying douche.

Felix has been a pretty humble and genuinely kind guy throughout the years who actually apologizes for the stupid shit he does. 

Imagine being the largest individual creator on YouTube and having MSM constantly attack your character about stupid jokes or edgy shit you've said in the past. That's a lot of stress and pressure for one fucking guy that probably feels like he has the whole world watching what he says and does ready to tear him down at any moment. 

Not even to mention the millions of fans that want you to be yourself and not bow down to the joke police that try and run society nowadays. 

He's in a hard situation and it seems like he's trying his best to make his fans happy and clear his name. I prefer his older vids like the book reviews and the whiskey testing, but I think he's legit a good guy."

I don't have to take care of my sister anymore since my mom got out of prison last year, but from the time I was 12 to almost 18 a daily part of my life was being there for my sister, our dog, and cooking for my grandmother.

He's human, average height, and a muscular build with peach skin tone. His hair is a dark brown and cut short, with light stubble on his face. Very piercing dark blue eyes, dimpled chin, and square jaw. Fairly average type of guy, not usually seen smiling. Very stoic and pragmatic. 

In terms of armor, he wears very simple gear. Darkened steel breastplate, gauntlets, greaves, and a nasal helm. A black gambeson underneath his gear with usually a dark red cloak as well. 

Two pretty simple weapons, a seax on his right side and a longsword on his left.

Learning to forgive myself has been incredibly hard. I try to move on mentally and let it all go but the guilt and regret tear me apart. I'm such a mess and it feels like a lifetime since I've been genuinely happy. Thank you for the good vibes and nice comment, means a lot"

She's mostly forgiven me for everything and we talk occasionally but she said could never trust me enough to be in a relationship again. That's a nice motto, I really like it a lot. And yeah this subreddit has been a lifesaver at times when I felt I had no one else to turn to."

Everything was great at first but I got worse over time and said to many things I can't take back. I was too scared and stubborn to get help before I messed it all up."
