I love how you've put this.  Personally, I am really torn on this issue and am male.  I want to believe women and lean towards your side.  It just feels to me like this is a debate on which gender loses and you've presented this in a way that's true to that.  Do we legislate in such a way that leads to innocent men losing their college careers, or protects women from rape more aggressively?  It is obvious which is worse but I understand guys who read the part of your statement I've bolded and feel like it's a really tough pill to swallow, because that could be us.  The whole narrative is a lose-lose.

Edit: I'm also kind of thinking, maybe this is a political decision that is not really best left to the public for this reason.  There's some people that say Brexit shouldn't have been a referendum, because your average joe has a poor grasp on the economic implications of Brexit, but they do understand nationalistic arguments about pride in your own country and will make a poor decision based on this.  Maybe this is something that the public shouldn't decide on.  Leave it to the professionals, whether that be student resources professionals, law enforcement, whatever."
AskMen,fqu4p55,t3_gkibs5,1589651970.0,"Hey there, well, I am younger (32) but am two and a half years past an 11 year relationship that damn near killed me when it ended so feel like I can comment.

When my marriage ended there was so much I felt like I couldn't do.  Even sleeping alone felt like a depressing challenge.  My ex wife and I were very codependent when it came to the household; I made all the money, she did all the housekeeping.  There I was turning 30 and needing to leave the only home that I could call my own, moved back with my mother, and needing to learn to cook, clean up after myself...like everything.  Not to mention dating which I still feel inept over.

Be ready to to through at least a year feeling like you were screwed and feeling kind of handicapped in this way.  It's like learning to walk.

I think it's great that you have the attitude of not wanting to be in another relationship.  I held my marriage up as proof that I was a success, and had to adjust when the divorce made me feel like a failure.  I've learned in these couple of years that you can't force relationships, and at a certain point you have to let go and recognize that living single is the default mode and living in a relationship is not.  A relationship can be a privilege or a burden.  The hardest part of my breakup remains to be feeling that I failed at love which feels like failing as a man, but I deal with these feelings a lot better now; it sounds like you already have a healthier mindset here.

You know what helped me a lot?  Getting new clothes.  A surprising positive impact.  They became a symbol of a new life past my marriage.  Just a thought.

Hey good luck it's a jungle out there

Edit: oh yeah, I did move out from my mom's later lol.  My divorce was around 12/17 and I got my firs tree apartment on my own on 6/19.  That was obviously a huge personal achievement although I'm still no master at the cooking and cleaning my ex always did for me throughout my 20s, I'm getting better, I like my egg sandwiches..."

Legend just means the player has sunk a lot of time into it this month, there's plenty of good players you see at low ranks because this month they arent in tryhard mode.

I would challenge your desire to play only paladin.  It's rarely a dominant class so if winning is important to you, there's more winning classes out there.  In my opinion it also tends not to get particularly cool and exciting cards.  But you do you.

Consider playing wild.  The competition is more expensive if not harder, but you have lots more challenging options you can use against your opponents compared to what you have in standard.  Mechs, odd pally are always pretty strong in wild."
