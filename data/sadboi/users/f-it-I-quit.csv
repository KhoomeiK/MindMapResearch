dysthymia,fn28c27,t3_fy9mqt,1586580703.0,"I can relate to so much here. Stoned and doing dishes - some of my best epiphanies. I also cannot remember a time where I ever felt “happy”. Maybe 8th grade for some award I got but otherwise, no felt happiness. It’s just puzzling to me what emotions feel like. I’m not even trying to be deep, cliche, or dramatic; I literally can laugh at jokes and smile but not experience the feeling of happiness. It’s all just empty, or I ridicule myself for some reason, or mostly it’s just to appropriately react to the other person because “that’s what I’m supposed to do”."
dysthymia,fn27l5h,t3_fylsvq,1586580085.0,I was in a relationship for 5 years and I don’t think we had sex for the last 2. I’m not even exaggerating. I just never felt like it; too much work.

Specifically for coping, I drink and smoke pot more than I should, i.e. every day after work and pretty much all weekend. It’s the only thing I look forward to. I’m sorry it’s not helpful, I’m just in a cycle of self-medicating because of depression but I can’t fight depression because I’ve found comfort (not the good kind) in self-medicating."

depression,f6z76ja,t1_f6yyz1l,1573311029.0,"TL;DR - Both? If that makes sense. I’m sure it’s rooted in depression but some of it is also real. I’m just exhausted from constantly pretending everything is fine and normal.

I have struggled with various health issues my entire life, from severe allergies/asthma as a young child, to GBS at age 12, to unidentifiable abdominal pain at age 38. I’m not a hypochondriac, FYI. I’m just tired of being in pain, sluggish, fat, heart palpitations, headaches, weird ankle pain, constant digestive problems... and then I have to act like I don’t. That’s exhausting.

The mental aspect is the constant worry and apathy. Those are the only two feelings I have. I honestly feel nothing in terms of emotion. I laugh, but I don’t feel happy, it’s just like “the response to humor.” I gave my grandpas eulogy and everyone was so glad I was strong and gave a great speech. I was the only one willing because I wasn’t even sad and knew I’d be fine to give the talk. Not so much as a crackle. To top it off, I don’t believe in life after death but I’m the only one that knows that.

And then, clearly depression - I just hate myself and every date rejection (ESPECIALLY those second-date rejections), bad choice, good choice followed by giving up 10mins later, acceptance that I’m going to remain single and alone, total embarrassment of my shitty apartment. Oh yeah, my 10year-younger brother just got married and bought a house. He’s also a doctor. I love him but don’t want to see/hang with him because it makes me so fucking angry with myself."

God damn I hate weddings."
depression,f1f0c3h,t1_f1ew54r,1569434294.0,Thanks. I am happy for them and will be focused on that for sure. Plus I know standing up just means the date will be alone much of the night.
