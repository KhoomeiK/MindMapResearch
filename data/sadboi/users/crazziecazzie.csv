Haircare,fjldy52,t1_fjjzkh2,1583444963.0,"Okay so for me I realised the important way to get it out was making sure that when I made the mixture it wasn't chunky but blended smoothly. Popping it in a blender with water will really help. Or whisking it with a fork, and maybe added some conditioner to the mixture. And then afterwards rinse and follow with a conditioner. Yes, I don't think the flour contributed to your hair fall. It's only flour, yes it could've been the scrubbing or just something else? And you're welcome. I had very very dry hair and I was using oil masks but it was still dry and I realised my hair also needed water. So even just spraying your hair with something as simple as honey and water and putting a hot towel over your hair will help dryness. The heat will help open your pores and let your hair absorb the moisture.

Also, before washing your hair with rye flour I suggest doing a clarifying wash to get rid of product buildup like silicones or else there will be a barrier over your hair strand and the masks won't absorb."
