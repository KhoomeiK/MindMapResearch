changemyview,fjjxof0,t1_fjjxeki,1583415144.0,"Every other democratic candidate doesn't seem to have a problem. 

Why do you say gaffes aren't a sign of mental deterioration. They can be and often are, if very frequent progressing over time, especially in someone who is 77."
changemyview,fjjvznx,t1_fjjq3hw,1583413804.0,They would only split the moderate vote more. Handing the non to Sanders. None of the moderates benefited from that situation. But after it was shown he was going to be the only viable moderate they had to coalesce. No point pulling a Warren and continuing to run and kill the chances of the only candidate who more closely aligns with you. No doubt both of them have now curried favours with the DNC and Biden's campaign. It was a smart career move.
changemyview,fjjvj7w,t1_fjju4p9,1583413426.0,Respectfully disagree. It worked last time and I don't think Trump has deteriorated much since 2016. He's just himself.

But c'mon the man is nearly 78 years old. I find it hard to believe that he's still operating up there with the same vigour considering the evidence. On the other hand Sanders can speak extensively and not make mistakes and he looks completely with it all the time."
changemyview,fjjuv1o,t1_fjjun71,1583412860.0,I think it's embarrassing for democracy that the 2 leading options are 2 people who are on the verge of being senile and should in no way be tasked with a job like being the president. This is nowhere close to an ideal situation
changemyview,fjjukt9,t1_fjjtdjn,1583412621.0,"There's plenty of clips out there. Forgetting what state he's in, having trouble saying full sentences, thinking he was still VP in 2018, saying 150 million people died from US gun violence, introducing his wife as his sister, calling himself Joe Biden's husband, the all men are created equal,, you know the thing. The kids need to hear lots of words...  

 He has these ideas that he just can't articulate coherently like he used to. I can only speculate what it is, but my guess is it looks like dementia, Parkinson's etc. Just the utter look of fear and confusion in his face when he constantly messes up and he knows it's not his fault is really sad. If he wins he won't even take office for another year almost, what will he be like then or in 3 years. It's a really big gamble"
changemyview,fjjt9k6,t1_fjjsvu8,1583411456.0,"You misunderstood. Trump doesn't have the same mental issues that Biden does. Trump wasn't of sound mind in 2016, but he still performed well in the debates. He's paranoid, unhinged etc. but he's not bewildered like Biden is. He's going to do what he did in 2016 in the debates and it will work again. Biden will look senile, but Trump will still appeal to his base."
changemyview,fjjspp0,t1_fjjs35o,1583410942.0,I'm not saying that at all. I don't have a dog in this race. Just saying Biden isn't what he used to be.
changemyview,fjjskv1,t1_fjjrlcm,1583410814.0,Because I think he will lose to Trump? I can't criticize Biden's obvious flaw because Trump is similar? There should be a better candidate.
changemyview,fjjomat,t1_fjjoaa0,1583406430.0,"He's been a politician for 40 years or more. He's definitely mastered public speaking, I've seen his speeches from 2008 and earlier. Very charismatic, coherent. To me, all his senior moments are evidently due to declining mental faculties.

I would argue there were definitely behind the scenes deals made between the drop outs for future prospects if they endorsed Biden. I'm cynical that Amy and Pete genuinely believe Biden is in good condition to be president."
