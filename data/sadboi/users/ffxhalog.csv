In your case you had absolutely no choice or say in the matter and thats truly heartbreaking. You were violated. You deserve to be angry but please not at yourself.

Herpes,ffrkiwj,t3_eusa4v,1580159909.0,"Sorry, it‚Äôs gonna be a long one. (Also on mobile so)
My partner and I have been on and off for a few years now. For a solid year we were basically just hooking up every few months. I remember I think the first outbreak and I thought it was just a ingrown hair(i mean it still could have been) and that shit popped in the most dramatic way ever wtf. Over the next few months it kept getting worse, happening again and again. The pain of just wearing slightly tight pants and my underwear sticking to bumps, ouch. I started to suspect it was herpes. I was in a ton of denial but at least one time after sleeping with him within 24 hours an outbreak would start to form, so it was quite obvious at that point. Around spring 2019 I finally talked to him about it and was super angry and upset. As i hadn‚Äôt slept with anyone except for him for years. He was sleeping around(i mean rightfully so as we weren‚Äôt together) but he never protected himself and this lead to us both having it. I was just mainly disappointed in him for not being more responsible for his sexual health but again, neither was I. I was consciously sleeping with him without protection or a second thought. Never thinking to ask if he had been with anyone else etc. 
Anyway now we talk about it openly and are together. We both have had medication for it and make sure we dont spread outbreaks when only one of us have it. 
As for getting diagnosed I could never see my doctor in time to have her ‚Äòinspect‚Äô a outbreak and she said there was no way to test it through like blood etc. So one day I just told her hey the only person I have been sexually active with for the past few years has been diagnosed with it, could I just get the medication. 
Lastly, through the time of realizing it was herpes I was in denial. And felt betrayed. I only had one true hookup in my life and always made the decision to sleep with as few people as possible to avoid std‚Äôs and just because I know I‚Äôm not one to want to sleep with many people because I feel like it would just get messy as I‚Äôm super emotional. But ultimately I have never truly stood my ground with partners about being protected while having sex. I can‚Äôt get upset while being complicit basically. This was just life‚Äôs way of saying stand up for yourself, or don‚Äôt be angry when something such as this happens. I am hopeful for the future even if my partner and I don‚Äôt end up staying together. I know there are medications, studies being done for a ‚Äòcure‚Äô and ways to avoid spreading herpes that I feel I would have no problem finding love one day. That was a huge thing for me when I was upset that I felt like nobody would ever want to be with me again and I would never find love. But after joining this subreddit and researching more I have hope."

BPDSOFFA,fdx1pfs,t3_en2m2j,1578764401.0,"I‚Äôm in the opposite situation lmao. My boyfriend wants me to move in but I know I‚Äôm still working on the whole splitting and discarding him thing. I wont get too into it. But ultimately I think the best thing is comparing whether he is doing this because he genuinely wants this with you or if he is doing it out of efforts to keep you close/stay with him. If he‚Äôs doing this (proposing, doing big gestures etc) within a month/few months or less I don‚Äôt know if its totally genuine but instead out of fear on his part. I feel like you should directly let him know he needs to slow down and give you time to build some more trust before trying to force these big events in a relationship that should come more naturally and communicated by both parties. I would say if he discards you again its 100% your best bet to move on. By all means give him a chance and talk to him about it if you‚Äôd like but i think his reaction may be pretty telling. I just think its not totally appropriate to throw those types of things onto your partner when you know you have issues to fix and trust to build. Ultimately you want something stable and longterm, if you‚Äôre not certain its with him you need to look out for yourself, and your future most importantly. Good luck!"

My application was denied but I went to a second advisor who made a plan with me to put 1000 into a GIC I believe(for about 12-18months depending if you want a higher interest rate) and have a co-signer for my first year being 18/19. She also verified I was working full time and actually had money etc. Worked really well considering I had no credit before this. I now almost 2 years later have the 1000 back, credit card is solely under my name and they have pre approved me up to 12000 worth of credit. I believe my credit is somewhere within the mid 700‚Äôs. I haven‚Äôt checked recently but I believe it would have gone up by now as I have phone bills and been paying off a car loan monthly(and going above and beyond for paying it back), and maybe missing one or two credit payments ever.
