She cried because she thought I would leave her or look at her differently because of it . But no I stayed and I helped her through it . Holding her hand while she fought with her cramps . Helping her shower . Letting her rest while I cook for her. So I say this to show you that your man is a child . DUMP HIM AND FIND A REAL MAN THAT WILL BE THERE FOR YOU NO MATTER WHAT"

A lot of people develop insecurities because of things like “oh nobody is interested in me” you know? I feel for those people but everyone has worth and should attempt to love themselves as much as possible because if you don’t and get into a relationship with someone you love, odds are you’ll wind up not being a priority in that relationship and you will neglect your needs as well."

worldwarzthegame,fgoy44t,t1_fgoxy2r,1580991487.0,"That’s literally what I’m saying. When I first got the game , I became bored of it within a month. I feel like a game with this much potential should never get to that point. I saw this game as the successor of L4d . But when you compare the two, A horde mode in left for dead would’ve worked ten times better than this. Maps were better, you actually had to coordinate, and overall it was a lot scarier . This game is even remotely scary . Like there are some key elements missing for me to take this as serious as I used to."
worldwarzthegame,fgoxuq3,t1_fgoxpcs,1580991220.0,Not at all man. I actually enjoyed it too when it first came out.  But it’s kinda repetitive isn’t it? Don’t you basically do a horde portion for each stage? They could have done more to make it stand out. Not to mention the fact that the player base doesn’t actually know what the hell it wants.

Secondly , dump her ass and find someone who’s better suited for you. This seems like a lot of unfair treatment and I really do not like the disrespect on her part. Instead of hanging up and saying she’s done , she should try to understand your POV and talk with you. Same goes for you. Communication is key. Go see her and sit her down and ask her why she’s acting like this? Maybe it’s because she wants you to move in with her , who knows? Just ask her and be gentle.
