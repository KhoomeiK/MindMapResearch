puppy101,fqslo00,t3_gk9bn0,1589610862.0,"Some small tips in barking..

1. It's going to be a long slog, but you will get there eventually.

2. Have treats handy, reduce food at feeding times if you're afraid of weight gain, but make sure you have some high value snacks in your pocket or similar. 

3. When she barks, have your snacks ready. Calmly get her to focus on you (say her name use motion, get her to look at you). 

4. Say ""quiet"", nice and calm. If she is quiet for even a second to take a breath. Reward her. 

5. She will start barking again. Keep repeating step 3 and 4. See if you can increase the time she is quiet before rewarding. 

6. Eventually (I did say this will be a looong slog). Your calm quiet will become a command and your dog will be quiet with you. 

This will unlikely stop the initial barking but will eventually give you a tool to minimise the effect. For stopping the barking there is a few things you can look to do. 

1. Figure out what is causing the barking. For us it's neighbours dogs barking. 

2. Introduce that cause in a controlled way. You say she barks at your conference sounds, play it deliberately and use them to train ""quiet"". Let the dog associate these sounds with good things. 

3. Remove as much of the cause as you can. Block windows, play radio when you arnt in the house, mute your conference sounds or wear headphones!"

Yes and no. I find more hardcore players in survival. I find myself genuinely improving in awareness and capability. In casual crucible I can play anything I want and still have a good chance of winning so it isn't particularly rewarding.

DestinyTheGame,flb4k1t,t1_flb2hri,1584997239.0,"Clearly not. The best of the best having an entire event dedicated to them is nonsensical. The top 40% maybe. Where the lower quality of those struggle to get 3 to 5 wins and the top 5 to 10 go flawless seems reasonable.

You have extremely poor views of what opinions are. If you're genuinely suggesting only 8% of light.gg users getting 3 wins is reasonable. You're fucking insane. If that's the case, this conversation is pointless."

DestinyTheGame,fl9i45t,t1_fl9h75e,1584956782.0,"Fair point, the punishment for quitting is to prevent the exact scenario we are discussing. To stop people auto losing to farm low wins.

>Especially when a third of the matches are disconnects.

Bungie have stated they can detect the difference between disconnect and quit. Hell they said they can tell if it was network fault or just pulling your plug.

Either way, the combination of better high win rewards and required loss to reset would do a lot for the community. If blueberries can make it to 3 wins they might not all leave trials and fuck the player base up.

It's actually interesting that people are commenting suggesting they are ok with this farm strategy. If you're top tier this farming strategy goes away very quickly when the only people left are other top tier teams. Top 15-20% is bottom of the barrel when the only players left in trials are top 20%."

I don't know if you just just leave, is there a penalty to starting another game / any penalty? 

Or they keep attempting to win. It's likely that this is more efficient than wasting time with a loss."
DestinyTheGame,fl9fc0s,t1_fl9etia,1584953121.0,"To be clear, I don't really care either way, but I do understand the impact of poor matchmaking.

The set up to trials leads to top teams farming first wins which prevents average teams from progressing to an expected point in the card. The impact from this, is reduction in player base. This is extremely unhealthy. Especially when the set up is actually quite reasonable. Match based on card wins will push teams to be as good as possible. An effective knock out system for flawless.

The flaw, is that this isn't the efficient grind for loot. There is not enough reward for trying to win as many as possible, instead the reward is to win a single game and reset."
DestinyTheGame,fl9e5gf,t1_fl9dodt,1584951569.0,"> Tf are you people smoking that makes you think the first game is by default easier than game 7

Statistics.

Who do you think is more likely to win 3+ games? The top tier players, or the average? 

The natural state tends towards top tier players and teams getting to 5+ wins and playing against each other, therefore reducing the potential for average teams to match them at <5 wins. This works if the rewards for grinding out as many wins as you can are actually worth it. They currently are not. 1 win grinding is more efficient. 

Trials uses card state matchmaking for the final stretch. If you win games, you're likely matched with others that have won games on their current card. 

This is confirmed by Luke Smith:

If you wanted to farm wins and tokens, would it be more efficient to sit at 1 win and constantly reset the card or continue to higher wins against harder opponents? Clearly the answer is to farm the 1 win. Meaning the skill brackets don't end up spread well and everyone is stuck grinding for early wins against stacked teams. It should be possible for reasonable teams to get to 5 wins, it currently isn't."
DestinyTheGame,fl9clw1,t1_fl98xqj,1584949631.0,"Because they are farming first wins for tokens. They play one game, it's likely easy so they stomp and then immediately reset.

If they have to lose to reset, there is an incentive to keep winning until they lose as it becomes more efficient to farm tokens.

This allows lower tier players to get to 3 or maybe 5 wins. The high skilled players are now spread over the win tiers instead of stomping 1-3."
