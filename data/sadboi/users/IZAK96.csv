But the thing is I just find it odd that interviewee are required to do this test and pay for it as usually company can just give some own made technical questions.

Also when I was thrown to the portal team, no documentation. All were pass through words. No black and white. Everything was based on words.

careerguidance,eut0yur,t3_ch7567,1564017587.0,"This will be an interesting story. I just resigned from a company by literally walking out from the company. Quick summary, my mental health was badly affected and I told my friend who's father has a  HR software system company. So she recommended me to her dad and I got accepted. Take note that this company is a family business. I will be combining each point from 2 different days which are (22/7) and (24/7) and how is related to each other. So here goes:

1st point: After 3 months, I got called by the HR(mother) few days ago and the HR said that my performance was not good and said I need to come early. The working hour is 9am -6pm. I was 5-15 mins late. Okay, I get it. Then things doesn't make sense, she told me to come early and leave late like around 6.30-7pm. I ask her what if I finish my work at 6.05-6.10. Can I leave? She couldn't answer. Then the next 2 days, I went to her room to submit my claims and she lecture me again. She told me she just scold one of the employees because he came in late like 30 mins(?) but he has a valid reason cause car battery died. She told the employee you should have taken half day leave instead of coming late. I said if he comes late then he leaves late. She said she don't want that. So you either come early or take half day. That got me thinking you told me to come early but leave late and you said you don't want him to come late and leave late.  I was like so I shouldn't leave late. She said you should leave late to stay and learn more because you're a new joiner. To me, it doesn't make sense at all but let you guys decide and share your opinion

2nd point: She lecture me on depression and told me about her daughter how she got depression and the cause is because of evil spirit. I won't share much on it cause it's private and confidential to share the rest of it. The reason she brought it up cause I have depression. I was like you're in no position to talk to me about my issue as my performance was not affected by it. Again, let you guys decide and share your opinion.

&#x200B;

3rd point: I was assigned to work with a Project Manager that **works from home** on a project. So after getting all the documents and requirements being clarified so can start working on the system configuration. The thing that got me surprised was when the PM ask me what to do next? For a moment there, I thought he was just testing me and when I gave an answer. He said he not too sure, he ask me to consult with the seniors in the office. The moment he said that, I was like you're a freaking PM who has work with the company for 5 years somewhere and you're asking me to consult with the senior. It makes me think so what have you been doing? After checking with the senior, I told him that we need to get data from the vendor. He ask me what are the steps to perform the data integration to the system. This literally makes me think that the boss hired an employee who has experience (I assume) and have no knowledge on the system. This is making me wonder what is going on with the employees. The boss got pissed at me for not paying attention in training that went for 3 days and expect the new joiners to know 100% of it in 3 days while that PM doesn't even know how the system workflow at all.

&#x200B;

4th point: The HR complaint about me being late,not paying attention and lazy. The late part, you can see from the first point. Not paying attention because of training. The lazy part is she mention after I complete my tickets and whatever task I was assign to complete. So after completing my work, I was labeled lazy. I was working as a helpdesk and many more cause this is a small company so we take many roles. So because of that, I was labeled lazy. Okay, fine. Then I ask her what other complaints and she couldn't answer. I ask her 3 times and she failed until the last time she said, she couldn't recall. That really got me thinking that those feedbacks were only from particular people cause those complains can be tell by who provided which technically it's my supervisor and the daughter cause those are the only 2 who knows what's going on.

&#x200B;

5th point: I ask her since this is a small company, why the feedbacks need to be tell by the HR and not by the person itself. I mean it's a small company and I don't know but thinking is that it should be a family and we can tell to each other face to face instead of going through HR. She said this is company not family. That statement there makes me think are we robots or slaves or something? Share your thoughts, anyway

&#x200B;

6th point: this is a big red flag from this company and I already got triggered by her. I provoke her and ask her where are all the fresh joiners and I only see the seniors that have work for 5 years plus stay? She got triggered and asked how I know? and who told you? I told her, it's not that big. I can literally see it with my own eyes. If you were me, you would somehow sooner or later ask the same question as me. You will be curious. All the new joiners left within 1 year itself. It makes you think there's something off about this cycle. She couldn't give me an answer at all. Instead, she go share another ex-colleague's story on why he left which I find it irrelevant. She ask me why am I asking so many questions? I said I was curious

7th point: I think this is the last but there maybe more but I find this are the strongest points. This took place when I was providing feedback on the training slide when me, the daughter and another PM discussing on it. I gave my feedback and said it based on the client's perspective. You need to know this **two** things, the **daughter** and this was **the only feedback I gave on the training slide** cause this will be relevant to what I'm gonna share. So yesterday (24/7/2019) was the day I literally walk away from the office. After giving 40-50 mins of lecture,I got fed up and admit that I want to resign. I told her the reason because of the hierarchy. She ask me what do I mean by that. I told her about the training slide that she told me that day(22/7) which I should not give feedback because it was the wrong timing. I was like huh? Wrong timing? I ask her what she meant by that and she couldn't answer but I was curious what you meant by wrong timing. She then said I, new joiner. You don't understand the system and everything. I said I was giving feedback based from the client's perspective but she don't like it. I was like you can just ignore it la. No need to bring it up if I'm wrong. It's just a feedback, nothing wrong. This is from what the daughter said to the mother because this was the only feedback regarding the training slide I provide. Coming back to (24/7), when I said that, she literally denied all the way that she didn't say anything about the training or the slides. I was so triggered that you are not admitting what you said to me cause it was 2 days. I literally said those words and she said she doesn't recall. I said you can ask your daughter cause I know it was her and no one else could have said. She totally defended her daughter stating that the daughter didn't say anything at all about the training slide to the HR. I got so pissed, I walk out to my table, send an email, left the stuff and literally walk away from the office.

&#x200B;

Note\*: this company has no rubbish bin or toilet paper. Also, if the HR was straight to the point rather than lecturing pointless details. I'll still be fine but this is absolute ridiculous,

&#x200B;

TLDR: too many red flags and I literally walk away from the office.

&#x200B;

Please share your thoughts cause I am interested to know what you guys think :D"
