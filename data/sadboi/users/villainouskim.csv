And yes. I choose to believe that most people who kill themselves are suffering from mental illness.

I worked in one of the busiest ERs in the nation. We had suicide attempts daily, many ended up successful. You can't tell me that the people who stab themselves in the neck with scissors are of a sound mind. Or the ones who choke themselves to death with the very gauze we used to cover up their self-inflicted cuts. Or the young teenagers who go through unimaginable pain from overdosing, only to be disappointed that they lived. Would you consider any of those people mentally fit to make any decision about their lives? 

Some cowards use suicide to escape judgment from their evil deeds, like rapists and murderers. But I'm talking about good people who are suffering to the point where they see no other option than to end their lives."

dogs,f5t1g5r,t3_dnseir,1572448276.0,"Floki is still having some trouble with potty training, but he's improving so much. Most importantly though, I'm so damn happy that he loves absolutely everyone he sees, human or dog. Obviously I keep him close to me and don't just let him approach random people or dogs, but it makes me so happy to know that he's had such a happy life so far that he sees all humans and dogs as friends. I hope he always stays that way."
AskReddit,f5t13dn,t3_dp2qtb,1572448037.0,"I'd start up a massive dog rescue program, with education efforts and spaying/neutering dogs free of charge for the owners/shelters. I'd pay all my staff extremely well and do my best to ensure that all dogs in my care get the best quality of life regardless of how little or how long they stay. I'd probably get as many dogs as possible from high-kill shelters and hire trainers and behaviorists to make these dogs as adoptable as possible. Maybe even go as far as going to other countries to implement spay/neutering programs for strays."

MadeMeSmile,f5jii3a,t1_f5jhz59,1572229515.0,"My husband was raised the same - fists, belts, and yelling were the methods of discipline, even with their dogs.

We moved in together and we got a puppy. When we were potty training the puppy and he'd go inside the house, at first my husband was like ""just push his nose in it and smack him!"" And I was like no, we're going to teach him using positive reinforcement (giving treats for good behavior). The puppy actually learned super quickly and it was an eye opener for my husband. He said he'd just never seen a dog trained this way. Now I gotta stop him from giving the dog too many treats!😂

My husband's learning, slowly but surely, that not everything has to be answered with violence. And he's loving it."
