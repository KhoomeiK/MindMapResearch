AvPD,fq8x496,t3_gha1ps,1589178135.0,"Can kind of relate, especially to the reluctance to watch movies/media. Do not like anything that is not fictional or does not have some greater problem threatening everyone so they are not focused on personal issues. Even fiction has its characters influenced mostly by real virtues and expectations of a protagonist that conflict with my personality but that is tolerable.

I try to dissociate from the thoughts by looking at people like they are aliens."

I can power through it at times but its like stepping on glass.

It is so ridiculous and absurd. Alcohol helps but not for long term obviously, Of course that makes me do more stupid stuff that I remember later.

I feel like the feelings of inferiority described as a symptoms of this disorder are objectively correct. As if self-awareness is the disease, but that is just me I guess."
AvPD,foxvw2x,t3_g9qncx,1588158081.0,"I don't like emojis because they can have multiple meanings and interpretations. I often interpret them as passive-aggressive or ironic.

I would say I prefer ""texting"" over ""facetime"" but I don't use my phone for anything besides basic utility. I also prefer not to look at people when talking to them and voice communication is hard enough.

I guess I prefer the ease and lack of urgency of texting VS seeing and hearing another person and having to react in realtime.

But I agree that text communication can be confusing and easy to misinterpret between not seeing how people are reacting and the emoji/meme spam."
depression,fl7ia9i,t3_fmefst,1584902305.0,"Im in a similar situation, no job, no friends, no life, 26.

Im happy you manage to put it behind you and go to school, I plan to do something similar, getting a IT cert or degree, but I struggle to go back to school because of severe social anxiety and depression/lack of interest. I feel like a joke because I have been ""motivated"" to stop being a loser for the last 5 years and I have barely acted on it.

I can't really give much advice but I block people that are successful out of my mind,  I imagine they are ""playing life on easy mode"" so they don't matter, Its not the most healthy reaction. I know those people are your friends but if they are messing with your head somehow I would distance myself a little from them."
AvPD,fl62s5z,t3_fll8x7,1584852617.0,"Can relate, don't think it is a AvPD thing.

The symptoms of the disorder (Feeling inferior/low self-esteem) might make you second-guess your effectiveness in society and demotivate you from pursing those tasks, atleast in my case. When studying or trying to get into a hobby, I find myself thinking something along the lines of: ""Why are you pursuing this? Do you think you can actually get a job in this field over a normal person?"" OR: ""You are only doing this so people will respect you""."

AvPD,fcvkbve,t3_eizla5,1578003933.0,"I cant enjoy games when i can hear people using voice comms, regardless if the people are criticizing me or not. I can ignore people criticizing me in text but it feels embarrassing in voice and I don't like how invasive/toxic people are on a mic. it breaks the immersion of the game in the first place. Its frustrating because alot of games I would like to get into require communication.
It would help alot if I got over it, I feel the same IRL."
AvPD,fcn6mpc,t1_fcn27of,1577804643.0,"> Do you think you'll give it another shot at the meetup?

Most likely not the same group, but some time in the future I might try again.

I really don't know what i would do even if i did ""connect"" or ""make friends"", its like climbing mount Everest, looking around and saying meh, now what?. I cant imagine what it would be like to go to a social event with people i know and not feel overwhelming anxiety. Also alot of my interests are solitary and i don't feel the need to talk much about them, although the idea of working on a project or playing games with friends sounds nice.

Its difficult for me to rationalize."
AvPD,fcn11o1,t1_fcmzyid,1577800162.0,"I made a push to reconnect a year ago or so, joined a meetup group and told them too much about myself and acted like a weird person in general had to leave because the negative thoughts would not stop despite being aware that they did not matter and i had to get over the anxiety.

I had a similar experience, my dad wanted me to get out of the house so i went into a ""hipster"" coffee shop and it was like a movie. Everyone there was in their 20s and all of them were talking and bantering among themselves. All of them seemed to be good friends with each other and i felt i walked into a club i was not invited to. I ordered a latte and had to walk out of the shop because i felt so much on edge. They did not add any sugar to the latte but it was not worth going back inside."
