AskReddit,fj3lx56,t3_fayx6x,1582987456.0,"It’s been pretty shit. I’m revising for a geography test on population and urban change. Also got my English poetry NEA on Monday and lasts till Friday. I’m under so much pressure and stress I feel like I’m breaking. I’ve been predicted all A’s for GCSE which is great, but if I don’t hit the target then I’ll be so disappointed in myself. Even though my parents are amazing and only want me to do my best, I feel as if I’m not enough. So much pressure at 15 years old I mentally can’t take it. (⚠️TW⚠️ED,depression, and suicidal thoughts) Also I’ve suffered through endless bullying that’s resulted in anxiety, panic attacks as a result of the anxiety, and a small eight month bout of depression where I was suicidal and on the verge of killing myself. Plus during that period of time I lost an unhealthy amount of weight. I actually don’t know how or why I’m still here. (End of ⚠️TW⚠️) I’m not looking forward to exams. They’ll be difficult"
