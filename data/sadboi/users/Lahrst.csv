SuicideWatch,etgonzp,t1_etg8kno,1562795604.0,Same I work with two beautiful women. Who are so nice. They brighten my day everytime I talk to them. They are both engaged. I can't help thinking why do I keep talking to them. When I know they both will move to bigger and better things soon.
SuicideWatch,eso18h6,t3_c8m3xk,1562157030.0,I feel the same. It's like all my friends are busy all of the time. All efforts to find some one to talk to fail.
SuicideWatch,ervj2dw,t1_ervdix7,1561317090.0,I mean things are only valuable if you value it. Value is subjective it's what you make of it. You don't have to be thankful or anything or even care about what you have. It's yours to value or not. Its just a matter of what is important to you. Ignore the other stuff and focus on the things that are important to you.

You were excited about joining the army, it's just a matter of you putting that perspective on something else. If you can't I can understand that. I can't bring myself to take my own advice.  It's okay to be disappointed. You are more than your mistakes. Even if it dosent feel like it."
SuicideWatch,erv8au8,t3_c40xcj,1561309065.0,"Is there anything that you value yourself? A story? A game? A sport?  Something that you do that while you are doing it, you can forget about everything  else? If not that's fine. I found that isolation just tends to get others to be like ""oh I should leave em alone""."
SuicideWatch,erv7blx,t3_c43sv3,1561308335.0,"Even though you can't join the army, you could try finding a place you want to volunteer at or join the salvation army. You can do anything that you want to. Take the motivation from the army to another positive thing."
