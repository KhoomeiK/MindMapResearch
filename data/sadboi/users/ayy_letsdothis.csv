I've been through this first hand and that's why I wanted to speak out about it."

lonely,ewfvpxg,t1_ewft3zw,1565368397.0,"I understand, we've all been there at some way or the other. All I can say to you is that you should really try figuring out what it is that you really want and then choose the right partner according to that.

Figure out what you want for yourself first ... Like why exactly do you crave attention and work on that and then think about getting into relations with new people..

I say this thing always, trying to find happiness in another person is never going to work out for anyone, in my opinion."
lonely,ewfmncr,t3_co3sip,1565364217.0,"I absolutely have. All you can do is lay down and wait for it to go away because it just feels like nothing could ever fix it, at the moment. 

But as time passes, you learn how to deal with it and it does get better ☺️"
