If you know you have to over come your own past baggage,  it is totally worth seeing a counselor/therapist so you can get past these things and not lose a 9/10 girl that adores you and has been sticking around for a year knowing your potential. If the time you spend is gold and she cares enough about you to stick around,  like the original post was stating - you have to improve yourself.- Be introspective and work on yourself in all things physical and mental,  be the best you.

 she probably wants to spend time with you because that's how she learned and inherited to show affection.  She may be preoccupied with the relationship because she gets satisfaction from giving affection and you may be avoidant because you require more personal time and freedom.  Nothing wrong with sitting down and talking about what you both want out of the relationship and what you require from each other. You may need more freedom and she may just need a text telling her you're thinking about her when you take that freedom. Don't sweat it and remember to have fun!"

I placeds an immovable rod outside the door in mid air and tied a rope to it, I then had the party caster shape stone in 1 foot blocks that I tied to a rope suspended from the rod and simple swung them into the room...
