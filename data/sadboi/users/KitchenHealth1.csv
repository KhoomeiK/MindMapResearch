Anxiety,flh2pn8,t3_fo6h6w,1585154984.0,Yes. Im grateful to find all of you guys. I had a full-blown panic attack last week after going to see my ENT. Lady scanning all of us before we went into the office admitted that she had not sanitize the thermometer and I went ballistic. It's been a week now and I'm constantly thinking I have the virus since she was so careless to not sanitized and swipe my face. Since then I've started Zoloft which I was so proud to get off of after being on for 15 years and medication free. So if then that's lockdown I have been extremely nauseous as to getting back on but at least I can breathe again. Thank you for all your comments somehow we will all get through this
