I can suffer till the cows come home. If that's all there is in life, fine. Whatever. But if my existing is causing OTHERS to suffer, That is something I cannot stand.

What I did about it was go through a restructuring of my life. I left my wife and daughter. Got my own place(and by own place, I mean I'm renting a cheap room from someone). Got a job so I could afford that room. Minimized contact with friends to \*just\* the things that bring them or both of us joy. I keep ALL of my pain to myself.

And it's working pretty well. I've kept the job. I've kept my room. I've spent a little time on a hobby. I wouldn't say I am happy, but I'm not feeling the strain of thinking I am a burden on others anymore."
