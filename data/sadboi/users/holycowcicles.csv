schizophrenia,f3v1u1o,t1_f3uyll1,1571170463.0,"i think that is a good plan:-) keep in mind as well that you have only a very small understanding of what she is dealing with so in the end, you dont have much to go on as far as what will be helpful and what wont, which is why i say try everything. im very glad i could help and i am here should you decide there is something else you would like to chat about. i know with 100% certainty that looking into your own awakening will help her in the long run. i cant stress this enough. you may not see the connection right now but i know you will come to see it the better you understand the true nature of the universe. give it a chance. google ""what is awakening"" or go to the subreddit ""awakened"" and just see what you find:-) ask questions. never stop asking questions:-) you, your mother and your sister are all incredibly strong people for what you all deal with on a daily basis. never forget how strong you all are:-) the possibilities are truly endless!"
schizophrenia,f3ux7wn,t1_f3uwe52,1571168669.0,"one thing i know is that the only thing you can control is yourself. therefore if nothing you do is changing anything from her end, then you cant do anything about it. so do something from your end. take action and start educating yourself. this is not something that will ever have a quick fix and its going to require action from both her side and yours. one other thing is that you will probably not have a clear idea of what might click for her and what wont, so assuming that showing her our conversation wont help might not be accurate. the only way i got to where i am now is by trying anything and everything i could find to change things. she is angry and screaming right now and you could show her our conversations and she may stay angry and screaming but by showing her you introduce the possibility for something to change. that possibility will never exist if you don't give it the chance to exist. try everything until you find something that makes a difference, even if that something is not me."
schizophrenia,f3uvijn,t1_f3utsy3,1571167967.0,"unfortunately her state of mind can he extremely irrational which makes it pretty impossible for her to see things clearly. if in the future she is having a particularly good series of days then that might be the time to try and introduce new ideas to her. the more worked up i have been in the past the more irrational my perception was. if it isnt possible to show her new things right now then the best thing you can do is start educating yourself  on the true nature of the universe and to also work on trying not to take her actions personally because i can tell you that from my own experience it could mean she is in a state of constant and unrelenting suffering that exists 24/7 and leads to desperation to try and get relief from the suffering which contributes greatly to the irrational state. she is dealing with something that i would imagine not a
single person around her has been willing to acknowledge other than to tell her everything she is experiencing doesn't actually exist and so her actions come from being in a state of survival alone. this is why i recommend you to start educating yourself and beginning your own process of awakening. the energy created by this will improve her situation. its possible i am wrong, everything you have described about her so far is very similar to my own experiences though. keep in mind as well that if she was not dealing with all this, chances are she wouldn't be treating you and your mother this way."
schizophrenia,f3us3o7,t1_f3ur6ul,1571166640.0,"i can say that i have had similar experiences to many of the things you describe. the biggest (and most difficult) thing that helped me to overcome that paranoia was to accept what i was not able to control and to (in my mind) let it happen and just let go. this of course took years of practice, however it has been the best solution to my own symptom of paranoia. i will also say that there were times when the ""voices"" in my head contributed to my paranoia by offering up suggestions to be about how everyone knew my darkest secrets or that my mother was actually evil and trying to force me to suffer. it was only after i understood that these voices are real individuals who exist in states of awareness on much lower frequencies  than our physical awareness that i was able to learn how to close myself off to them and stop them from interacting with me, and i have been successful at doing that. you are welcome to show her our conversation on here and see if any of this hits home
for her and i am more than willing to talk with her or you or however would be best. for you to help her tho, its going to be extremely important for you to realize that her symptoms are not just fictions being created in her brain but that her experienced perception is actually much greater than you are currently able
to experience. i will also say that you can learn to open and close these doorways within your own consciousness. i recommend following the subreddits on the topic of ""awakening"" so you can get a better idea about what i am talking about because the more you can understand how the universe truly is the more you will be able to help your sister."
BeardedDragons,f3uqcl3,t1_f3uoozc,1571165634.0,im sure when the time is right it will come to you:-) nice chatting with ya!
schizophrenia,f3uqa9h,t1_f3uo9jr,1571165593.0,"well, unfortunately she will be the one to have to make the decision to start seeking out solutions. i can also say that in our modern age, doctors who study the mind often diagnose labels onto people to make it easier to treat them and i find that people such as myself often have completely unique qualities to their afflictions that can make the diagnosed label attached to them somewhat in-affective.  now a little about me, i spent my entire 20s dealing with my issues, the first symptoms started presenting themselves when i was 19 and didnt get bad until i was 22, although i ended up quitting my job when i was 19 because i thought my coworkers were talking horrible things about me behind my back. now, i spent my 20s being completely debilitated by my afflictions and it wasnt until i started seeking answers outside of traditional western medicine that i finally started finding solutions. once i started developing my spirituality and began my process of awakening i started to understand the true nature of the universe and this is when i started finding solutions to my problems. i began to understand the ways universal energy moves throughout the universe and how this energy interacts with the energy within us. i studied how energy flows within us and how problems with the flows of energy within us can manifest itself in physical ways. i also came to understand that all matter in the universe vibrates at different frequencies and that within the much higher frequencies exists different levels of awareness. ultimately the matter that exists in these higher frequencies is something we today call ""dark matter."" now, i understand that these concepts can be very difficult to understand at first as it has taken me years of studying my own experiences to get to my level of understanding that i currently have right now and i know that there is so much more i still do not understand. the reason why i bring all of this up is because it is common for those with a diagnosed label of ""schizophrenic"" to have a consciousness that has certain so-called ""doorways"" that are open to these other levels of awareness that are typically closed in many other people. so when you hear about people who have voices talking to them or who can see or hear things that others cannot it is because they are experiencing things that actually exist, just in either higher or lower levels of awareness than this physical level of awareness that most people are aware of. their minds are not creating fiction, what they experience is real and it was only after that realization that i was able to take measures to teach my consciousness how to control my level of awareness that i was able to get to where i am now. since i have learned this i have gone from spending a decade in and our of hospitals being completely debilitated to someone who moved thousands of miles from home to one of the most difficult places to live in the U.S. (new york) and i have since started my own business and have gotten to a place where i experience levels of happiness daily where prior to my awakening i had never felt what true happiness was like. there is a lot more to this and unfortunately because everyones experience is completely unique, it will be hard for me to give any more advice until i know more specifically what your sister is experiencing. i hope that this helps. i am here to help further if i can."
