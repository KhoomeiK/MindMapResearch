DestinyTheGame,fmhgykn,t1_fmhgv4t,1586079699.0,I guess as well it would suck if everyone used the same amount of weapons or loadout unless they released a lot of options at the same time this was implemented.
DestinyTheGame,fmhgo73,t1_fmhegbt,1586079363.0,"Thanks for the fetailed response, I understand why people are not a fan of this. I'm collecting exotics atm then pinnacle rituals amd finally god rolls so this is a weird time to play in."

dndnext,fdpyzvp,t3_emn4pu,1578646695.0,"I beleive as a player that other players should have a basic grasp of the game and should know their characters since theres nothing more disappointing for myself.

The other dude snapping in frustration sounds like this might not be the game for him, maybe too complicated or would rather prefer a more ro/flavoir route. He seems more the asshole. 

You seem ok, want to play the game"

I made a few several chars already and after 40+ chars on dndbeyond i cant wait to try more on this. 
You've probably already had suggestions but pets when youre ready and animated characters themselves. Would love to interact with them in a game or inplented somewhere else interactive like a hub of npcs."

I had seen the kickstarter back in August but stupid me didnt back it so yesterday incognito ninja style in class i got my debit card and bought a key. 

When you have an account let your imagination run wild, mine has and its been a day! Cant wait to get pets and see what other features get released.. love even to play with these characters some day."
learnprogramming,fdf5x9z,t1_eznaz2y,1578354048.0,"This is a nice comment. Currently in a college Software Dev course but coding seems to be my crutch this semester. 

I don't know if its lack of motivation, purpose or lack of proficiency leading to loss of confidence. We're told to build things and follow instructions but feels like the purpose is lost on me. Currently Java and C# with VisualB, I dont want to fall behind and while im behind a pc everyday I dont want to doubt if im on the right path at this stage."
