TwoSentenceHorror,fqgp9sc,t3_gir9q9,1589352745.0,"Firstly, let's think logically here.  Do you even NEED toast?  i mean, you have to pee anyway.  So, go do that, out through the back door, maybe.  Then go check the circuit breakers and see if the bathroom one has been tripped.  Also consider...do you have a tub?  If the breaker HAS been tripped, then calmly shut off the main water valve to the house.  Get on some rubber boots, rubber gloves, and possibly a mask.  Consider whether you have pvc or copper tubing going into the tub.  Copper tubing is better at conducting the electrical current from the toaster into the water, which might cause a lil more toasting than pvc would.  If they were HOLDING the toaster, there'd be much more damage to the body.  You can forget about the electrical show, the sloshing around, the zap zap zap omg zap zap thing like from Bride of Chucky, that kind of thing doesn't actually happen.  It's more like a sudden ZAAAAAAAAAAAP and it's over.  Oh, and if you're not a complete idiot, and you knock on a door, and someone does live with you, but they don't answer the locked door like ""o good morning, i'll be out in a minute"" or ""sorry bro I'm negotiating with North Korea, ya might wanna hold it"" then chances are you're already unhappy and just get dressed, go to work, grab something to eat along the way, and deal with w/e when you get home.  ....you DO live alone, right?

sexover30,fiztxrh,t3_fak0ql,1582874558.0,"i think you should start out as soon as you leave your house.  seperate hotel rooms, in diff hotels.  you both end up at the bar whenever you get there.  you don't watch for HER, adn she doesn't watch for YOU...but you notice each other and make connection with your eyes.  YOU order her a drink (one that isn't her favorite, but is a close second, because man, you don't know her).  When she gets it, raise your glass and you two 'cheers' that way.  Later into the night, after enjoying the music and a little solitude, YOU go to her table (if she hasn't come to you already).  YOU woo HER.  You had no idea she existed, bro.  since you don't know what hotel she's at, and she doesn't know where you're at, you decide on after-closing drinks at one of those locations.  Flirting, light touching like a h and on an arm, do nothing that's particularly NORMAL for the two of you...except...those little things from way back when.  the sweet things.  the things that drew you in.  you notice the way she flips her hair like it's the first time, and you really watch it happen, man.  you're both back at the beginning.  and hey...things can get tense in a marriage.  don't criticise a damn thing.  you're out to mildly impress, but also to make sure she feels comfortable and sane around you lol

BipolarReddit,fhxc7nf,t3_f1c9c3,1581950825.0,"Kay, guy, I'd like to say you're thinking about this too hard, but, you're not thinking at a normal speed.  Seroquel slows EVERYTHING down.  Your movements will also get sluggish, self-care, everything.  The psychosis may have thrown your world-view askew, it usually does, but with time you adjust to it and you'll see it merely continues your development as your own being.  Seroquel is given out more and more, which I don't understand.  If you aren't prone to psychotic outbursts or mania, there seems to be no real need for it.  Through CBT and DBT therapies, you can control on your own what seroquel is trying to do for you.  Since you're early on that track, you stand THE BEST CHANCE at this.  If you need to study, seroquel would not be the best idea, at least not for extended periods of time, and maybe pull the dosage back a bit.  Ask your doctor about this, suggest a lowered dosage so you can hopefully eliminate the sluggish feeling.  

The psychosis...I don't know what you went through.  You probably couldn't even tell me.   You HAVE TO REMEMBER it did not melt your brain.  The human brain IS incredibly adaptive, yes, and since it had not happened before you are unable to understand it, as this is now your baseline.  Your brain really is just readjusting itself, having been rattled like that.  Think of it like taking a really nice nap and being woken up with A REALLY HEAVY DOOR BEING SLAMMED RIGHT NEXT TO YOUR BED!!  You take time to calm the fuck down before you can think through the shock.  It's like that.  When I think back to before my first time with this, I find I have a much stronger connection with my willingness to learn and absorb information.  If you pay attention to your world now, keeping in mind your world before a month ago, and analyze what the difference was in that transition, you get your triggers, or set of triggers, that made this happen.  Take your time but buddy, push through that fog, just not too hard or you'll tap out for awhile longer.  Baby steps never hurt, but how bout you make them EASY steps instead?  Idk the kind of region you live in, but I can say it's like stepping out into the winter weather but you're wearing good boots.  Perhaps like being drunk while about to walk into a place of business.  Getting off the Gravitron or the Zipper but tryna look cool.  

If you've made it this far, it's not for lack of confidence.  As unforseen as psychosis IS, now you know that it is NOT.
