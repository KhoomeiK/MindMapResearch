books,fpv73b6,t3_gf93xd,1588937121.0,"It's strange because anytime I am able to actually read for longer than 20 minutes I get really absorbed in the story. I will get that old familiar feeling that made me love reading in the first place, where I can visualize everything and be completely immersed in the book without having some nagging thoughts distracting me. I love when that happens but I always end up ruining it for myself! I will finish a chapter and be ready to keep going, but then I will peek at my phone or do someething to divert my attention and that is all it takes..I lose my interest and move onto something else.

I also sometimes feel anxious when I read..which is the last thing I want when trying to relax! I find the same thing happens with movies. Some days this isn't the cast at all and I can get through quite a bit of reading..But it seems more often than not it is a struggle which really makes me sad."
Anxiety,fpg4f4r,t3_gcrl8u,1588593920.0,"Omg yes! I was taking a phone order at work one day and I could hear my boss behind me giving someone crap and she sounded realllly angry. I started getting really nervous and my heart was racing as I was trying to focus on the call. My boss is one of those people who just sound scary when they are pissed, I didn't want to cross her the rest if my shift!"
Anxiety,fp28u93,t1_fp282g4,1588257419.0,"It really helps to have someone with you during those moments I find. I will avoid going to the store for hours sometimes until my bf can be with me. Other times I feel completely fine going alone and I enjoy it. I really try to make the most of the good days because they are pretty rare!

But keep trying! I try to only focus on today and what I need to tackle and no more than that. Some days you'll get through it like a breeze and other days it will take all your strength to get out of bed. Don't be too hard on yourself if you have a lot of bad days..Just try to really appreciate the good days when they come. 

I have talked to my doctor as well about all my issues. She seems to think a couple books will cure my bad thoughts and doesn't want me on pills ""for years and years"" so I have unfortunately not had too much help with it but I try my best to overcome it on my own.  

Thanks for talking, I don't post too much on here so it was nice to get a reply! Have a nice day!"
Anxiety,fp283xp,t3_gap921,1588257017.0,Constantly. Between my heart and my stomach I sound like a machine! I can also hear my heart beating when I lay down at night..Makes me think of a ticking clock and it drives me nuts!
Anxiety,fp27tlm,t1_fp27k9l,1588256861.0,"Aww thank you! Luckily it always passes eventually, but yes in the moment it's so hard to control or act normal if you are in public. I feel like I just look so awkward and that causes more worry. 

Hope you are doing okay as well!"
Anxiety,fp26qeo,t3_gaarcc,1588256255.0,"The physical side of anxiety is what makes it the hardest to manage imo. I can usually pep talk myself out of feeling bad mentally (but also sometimes not and I just consider those days to be write-offs where I stay in bed) but when my heart is racing and I feel dizzy etc it is just too much. I cannot focus on anything I am doing, can't really eat but also feel so weak. It really is a bitch to deal with. There are times where you have to push through it and you feel like you really may faint or something.

It is also frustrating to feel so crappy physically but be told by your doctor that all your blood test results are normal and my levels are good. I sure as hell don't feel good!"
Anxiety,fp263mg,t3_gamj34,1588255899.0,It is ALWAYS at that moment of laying down all cozy that I realize I forgot to do something that day or different issue will pop up and I panic about it. During the day I can't seem to keep my eyes open but at night I am wide awake worrying.
LibbyandAbby,foz7wbe,t3_ga267k,1588186161.0,"Although a few of the different theories about who it may be have interested me, I lose a bit more hope each month  that passes by with no new updates. When I first heard about this case I was anticipating someone getting caught that year, I never imagined so much of the story would still be a mystery at this point.

I still feel like that day may come. I sure hope so anyways. I think many of us will be shocked to see they have matched a face to that damn voice finally!"
zelda,fou67bf,t3_g9b2ck,1588077258.0,"I have been playing different remixes of Zelda songs all week! So relaxing when you are reading or cleaning and stuff. 

I remember being around 12 years old and I was home for spring break. This game was pretty much consuming my life with how obsessed I was with it! My aunt and 3 cousins were staying with us at the time so we would often play it together. I distinctly remember playing through the Gerudo Fortress part and getting stuck so many times. We would even go outside and ""play"" Zelda at my fort. I would be Nabooru and my cousin was Link. The poor guy had to deal with me pretty much torturing him for fun lol but it was good times. 

I also remember the first time I ever beat the game. I was staying at my best friends house for the night and we had been trying to beat Ganon for hours. Her brothers ended up coming in to watch and her mom brought us snacks and stuff. It was so much fun and we all freaked out when we finally won! Then we did it all again.

I really loved playing those games with a group of friends. Things always got funny and we would all work together to figure out what to do next. It just isn't the same now playing by myself! I think this may be why I love watching youtubers playthrough the games with commentary."
BadMUAs,fooz4sx,t3_g8lfh6,1587949552.0,Literally just watched this movie an hour ago! This made me laugh so much. You aren't wrong!
offmychest,fomua0v,t3_g8ce2a,1587904036.0,That's so awesome! I am sure it will be the first of many compliments like that!
AskReddit,fomtfps,t3_g88ccd,1587903231.0,"Not at home but at my trailer. 

My family used to own a small trailer that we would keep at a trailer park every summer. It was about 15 minutes from where we lived but felt like we were hours away. It was really nice out there and had a pool and stuff so I liked to invite my friends sometimes to come camping. I knew almost every other family there too and had friends at the park as well.

On this particular night I was having my friend stay the night with me, but it was going to be just us that night for the first time. My mom figured I was old enough now (15 at that time) to stay alone for the night and she was coming back early the next morning with breakfast for us. 

We did the typical watch movies and eat junk food thing, and then decided to go to bed as it was pretty late. About half an hour after we laid down I kept hearing what sounded like footsteps right outside my window on the deck. I asked my friend if she could hear it too and she said yes. I had totally forgotten until that moment that I hadn't locked the front door, and right as the thought was coming to me a man bursts right in! He was one of my neighbours who I had known for years but never really talked to. He was absolutely wasted and kept asking us to come over to his campfire. I kept saying no and was trying to play it cool and told him we just wanted to go to bed but he kept at it for a few minutes. Finally he laughed and told us we should really lock the door and left. 

We were pretty shaken up (especially my friend who's bed was right next to the door he came in) and I didn't get much sleep that night!

 The next morning we let the park manager know what happened. He was extremely pissed off that this guy was bugging two young girls in the middle of the night.  He gave him a talking to/warning and I didn't hear much else about it. My mom was pretty horrified to find out as well."
nintendo,fokntnn,t3_g7vuf0,1587845565.0,Farmers markets! I love going to those each week in the summer. This year I was hoping to set up a table of my own with my sister (we just started a side business before all this started) so I hope we still get to!
books,fo6x9ij,t3_g5xdtn,1587568433.0,"I cannot imagine the kind of stress you must be feeling each day. I wish you could just have some time to chill out and get lost in a book! Maybe an audiobook would be a better option? You could listen on the way to and from work, while you cook dinner etc. Sometimes the narrator puts on different voices and I find that helps me get even more into the story. Hope you can get back into it soon and stay safe out there!"
books,fo6wt9t,t3_g5rim1,1587568197.0,Yes. One word can change my whole understanding of what is being said sometimes!
LibbyandAbby,fo6g98u,t1_fo4u5ho,1587557954.0,"Seeing this photo really creeped me out. After analyzing the original to death it's crazy to now see clearer outlines of what all he's got shoved in his coat (I can see what looks like a gun and something in his pant leg?) And it looks like he does have a hat on, I see some kind of symbol or something on the side of it."
unpopularopinion,fo339h6,t3_g557ti,1587479715.0,I am at the point now where if I don't have some sort of music or white noise going I feel super anxious. Probably isn't a good thing..

onguardforthee,fndfndf,t3_g0ld9z,1586868843.0,"I am currently still working part-time. I just got this job in February before all this craziness began. I am already on monthly assistance, but with my very low hrs (10 or less) it really isn't very much at all to live off of. I don't believe I qualify for any other assistance and I am not sure at all what to do. It was hard enough landing this job as I am from a pretty small town. Very stressed out!"
Wellthatsucks,fmyevs6,t3_fxr4tu,1586484528.0,I can't stop laughing at the toast for some reason.. it looks so innocent in the midst of all the mess.
FuckYouKaren,fl2wrgi,t3_flxuyc,1584761965.0,"I have been getting a lot of that at work as well ever since we put up signs for customers to stand at a certain distance when ordering (I work in fast food).

I had one elderly man tell me that was stupid and for me to stand the hell back as well if that's going to be the rule. He also was angry he couldn't eat in the dining area and rolled his eyes at me for asking questions about his order..

I thought that most people would understand but for the remainder of my shift people got worse or didn't notice any of our signs at all. Luckily my coworkers are cool and stood by me anytime someone was like this. The anxiety in general is bad enough!"
millionairemakers,fl2u908,t3_fm4msu,1584760060.0,What an awesome idea! Will be life changing for anyone I would imagine at this time! Best of luck to all the other commentors! Stay safe.
ontario,fkxdoyr,t3_fl8pip,1584625810.0,I just started working at a fast food place a couple weeks ago. We are still open but take-out only and almost every shift people get sent home early. I am not really sure what will happen here but for now it seems we will stay open.

books,fga7enf,t3_ex9g0o,1580647719.0,"I think this is pretty normal! At least in my experience. I often feel like I have to ""study"" a book I am reading in order to grasp it fully. I also spend a large chunk of the time looking up definitions and references and it can get tedious for sure, but by a lot of the time it feels good to learn new words and the story makes much more sense. The app I am currently using has a built in dictionary which is a BIG help/time savor for me. 

There are also times where I just cannot be bothered to do all that work and I just want to sit back and enjoy a story, so in those cases I will tend to choose a book that I have already read or has a more simple plot. It really just depends on my mood.

 Don't feel stupid for how you take in information! It is a good thing to constantly be learning more and nobody knows everything! Try to read what you enjoy and if it starts to feel like a chore maybe switch up what you are reading and save the other books for when you are in the mood for more of a challenge."
