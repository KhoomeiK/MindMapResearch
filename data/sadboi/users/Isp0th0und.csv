PSSD,flmc3v4,t3_fleqsf,1585279657.0,"omg. yes. i used to get a lot of small colds and strong seasonal allergies very frequently but never do now. i’m also experiencing all of the same traits as you— lack of dreams, creativity, daydreaming, memories, TERRIBLE anhedonia. no motivation and little anxiety. i barely recognize who i am anymore. i took SSRI’s and dopamine agonists for less than a year..."
anhedonia,flk0oaw,t3_fpal42,1585231371.0,what dose of pramipexole did you go up to?
anhedonia,flk0ley,t3_fpal4e,1585231318.0,"i feel the same way, almost as if i’m not in control of what i say, it just sort of comes out. my brain is completely blank a lot of the time. i’m not sure if this is some sort of dp/dr but i also just feel a sense of loss of self. lost ability to visualize well, think things through deeply, articulate well, remember memories, etc. it’s different than social anxiety i experienced in the past, because that was a feeling of thinking TOO much."
PSSD,fk75tyg,t3_fgslly,1583928561.0,"same situation with zoloft. it’s been almost a year now :) you can either try another drug that should help with libido like Wellbutrin, try natural supplements that may help, or just give it time. i’ve heard from this forum that females have more luck than males in the long term recovery-wise."
anhedonia,fk4wll1,t1_fk4vmt9,1583869007.0,never have used any sort of benzos .glad to hear you came out of it. i want to feel music again more than anything.
antidepressants,fk2wuui,t1_fk2suw3,1583811114.0,"hi. did you take any supplements, other meds, or change anything about your lifestyle in order to improve? how did the numbness disappear—was it rapid or super gradual? thank u"
antidepressants,fk2wbvl,t3_fg506u,1583810743.0,"this happened to me with zoloft, it’s now been 9 months with no change. check out r/PSSD or r/anhedonia"
anhedonia,fk2swz4,t1_fk1xdxs,1583808407.0,"have you noticed if the supplements you’ve been taking helped with feeling emotions (enjoying music, nature, art, etc in particular) ?"
anhedonia,fk2pbhm,t1_fk1xdxs,1583806054.0,thank you so much this is so insightful
anhedonia,fk1i9jt,t1_fk0yc0l,1583780219.0,wow!! thank you. i’ll definitely try some of those supplements. i had no idea about the serotonin stuff
anhedonia,fjzs52x,t1_fjz5ghq,1583727689.0,"yes, pramipexole. i took it for about a month and a half but only went up to 1.5 mg (maybe i should’ve gone higher?). there was no noticeable effect whatsoever besides bad insomnia and nausea. anhedonia persisted and after i went off it got worse. i went off of it really abruptly so that could be a factor as well."
bipolar,fj5pa2x,t3_fb1wo2,1583038725.0,"i tried it. I think it helped with motivation/ outlook but it caused nausea and didnt help with anhedonia . After going off it, anhedonia got way worse ."
antidepressants,fhxzr94,t3_ex0tg1,1581965608.0,any updates? experiencing the same thing after Zoloft + Wellbutrin and it’s been a year
depression,fh9vpot,t3_f21ru4,1581390707.0,"I am so sorry you are going through all of this. 

All I can say is, reach out to teachers and counselors. Seek support. Most teachers will help you academically to some extent if they know what you’re going through, believe me. You should NOT be ashamed to share. 

You are not defined by this. Your future is not defined by this. Stay strong ❤️"
depression,fh9rl9e,t1_fh5fgju,1581388006.0,"This is so right it’s scary. I’ve been anhedonic lately (no emotions at all) and it’s way worse than sadness for me because I no longer have emotional states to define my reality, to attach to. Without the nostalgia or feelings tied to music and environments, I feel more confused and lost in this state."
anhedonia,fgxkjoq,t1_fgs6z9z,1581173800.0,it may work for ya . Worth a shot
anhedonia,ffumo5f,t1_fenh8dw,1580245193.0,yep
anhedonia,ffpbjuq,t3_eug4gf,1580090952.0,"I used to dream every night and was often emotionally affected by my dreams. Since developing anhedonia I never remember my dreams (I don’t even feel like I’ve dreamt most of the time)... but when I do they are often simple and negative, based around daily events and sources of anxiety"
anhedonia,ff86leh,t1_ff7b5cr,1579667441.0,no noticeable effects for me but that isn’t to say it won’t work for others... good luck!
anhedonia,felo046,t3_eps0jj,1579226750.0,"music. it was such a gradual loss... yet probably the most evident over time. music used to be everything for me, the ultimate source of catharsis. 
Ive watched helplessly as the emotion slipped away, leaving me with only a basic admiration for “good” rhythms. sometimes I catch glimpses of how I used to feel, all that I have forgotten. and it hurts. I miss myself. I don’t know how I can keep living like this."
anhedonia,fejnpkg,t3_elat59,1579180982.0,any updates?
anhedonia,fdllu5o,t1_fcwppla,1578526941.0,how did it work?
anhedonia,fcvg9x7,t1_fcv5aqs,1578001470.0,yes. I started experiencing anhedonia almost immediately after starting (although I didn’t understand what I was experiencing at the time) and it has gradually worsened to a point where I feel absolutely nothing at all.  I’ve tried a number of meds with no avail. the only one that kind of made me feel something was Wellbutrin but I experienced extreme anxiety on it and it was still fairly ineffective.
