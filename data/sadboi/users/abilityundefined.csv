Gunners,fd4ankd,t1_fd41xhw,1578165840.0,"Yes. Yes he was. You can't view this as an isolated incident. For how long have we shit on Xhaka? Do you think he does not feel the same things we do if he is a celebrity? Do you think death threats to your daughter wouldn't cause you to hate the fans? Constant insult, constant discouragement, and constant hate will make even Henry leave the club. We were wrong to treat our players like that. There are ways of showing dissent other than just blatantly doing all of these things. One of the things that made me an Arsenal fan was how we always had our player's backs. I'm sorry but we don't do that anymore. I'm not saying what Xhaka did was right, just that it was justified. He had his reasons, which I completely understand. It's easy to sit at home and throw out criticism, but being on the field and facing the hate of millions of people day in, day out is NOT easy. Furthermore, I'm pretty sure the well-being of our players and their mental state also has an effect on their form. That's why I believe that his mental health is wayyy more important than some abstract value we gave to the armband. Even leaders are allowed to feel."
