OCD,fqmwg76,t3_gjq4wu,1589484668.0,Harm ocd wasn't my main theme but they have helped with a lot of my problems. There's definitely way less thoughts then before and I had an easy time adjusting to mine. But of course everyone's experience is different. I was scared of them before I tried so I definitely understand the concern. Good lucküëç!
OCD,fqmuezb,t3_gjrc8r,1589483701.0,"Hey, I just want to say as someone who has suffered a lot from ocd alone. Thank you for being there for your brother. I know it has to be very very difficult so I know you're definitely a strong person. That being said, if you really wanna help it's gonna be a lot more difficult than what you've been doing. I'm sure you understand that rituals only feed into ocd. So what I want you to do is little by little stop going along with them. If you do this all at once it'll do more harm than good. But bring this to your brothers attention so he knows why you're not going along with them anymore. Motivate him to stay strong as you both try lessening his rituals. I also want to add a quick note here. You are not your brothers carer, I mean, maybe you actually are, but you still shouldn't tire yourself out. Because not everything can be in your control. Make sure that when your brother gets to those really difficult points (suicidal, or angry) you sympathize with him, but also let him know that while he is going through a hard time, he is still strong. He wouldn't have made it this far if he wasn't. I'm aware that his psychiatrist says it's a very complicated case (by the way a therapist is the person he really should be talking to about more specific things he deals with) but that only changes the steps to recovery he needs to take by a little. From the sound of things he's gotten his mind stuck in a distorted state, which I have been in plenty of times myself (not as intense as him but I can still understand). Slowly as he works on getting refocused on more normal things he'll hopefully get back his sense of reality. I'm not a certified expert or anything but I do know a good bit about ocd and I'm speaking partly from my own experiences. A good source might be chrissie hodges on YouTube. She has a lot of good information. 

Side notes:
*erp is a good form of therapy for ocd but it is extremely hard
*your brother shouldn't worry about saying embarrassing things to mental health care workers, they have heard pretty much everything and anything
*it may help to look at your brother as someone who's addicted to something. You wouldn't let that person get anymore of their addiction. But you would also make sure that they are cared for during that time that they are trying to fight their addiction.
*good luck and stay strongüí™üëç"
OCD,fqcm2oc,t3_gi2kij,1589261892.0,"Someone in the line of work that she is in should understand very well how this stuff works. Of course we're gonna fall back on hard times every now and then. I say don't get discouraged from trying out self treatment it's worked for me and a lot of others. So if you try it and it works for you, go for it. On one hand I understand why people don't like that form of treatment but most of my own recovery was done by myself so I see it as a good option to try if you don't have any others."
OCD,fqcl1nu,t3_gi3p5v,1589261059.0,"I think you're definitely just worrying yourself. Before I got my current therapist I had relapsed and recovered on my own while having to deal with a very ignorant counselor that even played into my obsessions plenty of times. I'm a young guy too so if I was able to learn to understand my ocd and better myself without the extra help you will too (and you have before so you're all goodüëç). Also, i would like to add that even if you got a therapist that specializes in ocd, at the point that you're at, most of the time they'll be telling you stuff you already know (not that they don't help at all cause mine definitely does with a lot of my other problems). The good thing about this post is that you've identified your problem, so realize that it's just your mind placing doubt and focus on your recovery. Good luck!"

But sadly it's like show biz in a way. You gotta know your audience. If you know its someone that might not want to actually get into that conversation than a, ""I'm fine"" answer will work. But if someone actually cares, or you at least suspect them of caring, you shouldn't let that go to waste."
socialskills,fq96wwj,t3_ghhpns,1589187759.0,The same shit happens to me XD. I've gotten better though. For me it was a confidence and anxiety thing. One thing you can do is work on feeling better about yourself in general then it'll probably improve. It did for me. I guess a more specific tip I can give is try to have a nonchalant attitude towards people that look at you in public. Even if you're faking it at first it'll eventually help you to not pay attention to that sort of stuff anymore.

ForeverAlone,fmdfjyv,t3_fueiju,1585966545.0,"I'm gonna be honest. I read a good amount of each paragraph but I'm focused on multiple things right now so I didn't get through every detail. I also want to say your english is really good! Anyways I'm a bit older than you and have been through very similar experiences. I'm gonna kind of explain a little about my background then explain how I improved myself so you can get a clear picture of everything. When I was your age (and actually even younger) I did not have a good relationship with my family. And ""friends"" would only use me. So after a while I isolated myself from everyone. For my own health that was not a good idea (and it doesn't seem like it's good for you either). At first it was really painful. Because I felt much like you. I wanted connections but I felt like nobody wanted to make a true connection with me, or that nobody was the type of person to want a connection with the type of person I was. I started blaming everyone around me and thinking that everyone was shallow. But in truth some people just don't put much thought into stuff like that. Anyways me isolating myself caused some serious mental health issues for me later in life (it also didn't help that my family situation wasn't great). It made me gain a strong distrust of people in general (family, friends, ect.). For example it took my current group of friends 5 years for me to actually consider them friends. But what I learned from having my group of friends around for so long is that thinking about people as ""types"" or limiting myself from other people might have just been things I used to protect myself from being rejected or betrayed. And even if that's not the case for you there's also another way you should try looking at this. To me you seem like a very observant and more complicated person for your age. You notice things and struggle with stuff about yourself that many people your age don't even think about. But let's say I walked past you on the street. Would I know that you were that type of person? The answer is no. So just because people don't seem like they would get along with you things aren't always as they seem. People are like books in a way. One chapter might be about how they like sports. Another might be about how they got their heartbroken. And another can be about how they're scared to let people see how much they like art so they only ever talk about the sports. I know it was a bad example but it's just to show you that since they hide that about themselves it's gonna be way more difficult to find people who have the same interests as them. Another tip I have for you for life in general is to try and keep an opened mind. The people I'm friends with now are not the type of people I thought i would be friends with. But I know that they care about me and have my back. So maybe just give other people a chance and if they don't work out as your friend it's gonna suck. But there are always more people who want a connection just like you. Lastly, I've struggled with my fair share of breakdowns and bad mental health without anyone ever knowing about it. If your worried about disappointing your family cause of the self harm or crying thing, or even about the lonliness. Don't. It's okay to feel bad about these things but most families rather try and help with these feelings instead of something bad happening instead. Good luck, and also even if you just start by opening up to your family before opening up to people at school it can be a big help."
dating_advice,fm96hdq,t1_fm957u8,1585862630.0,"Yeah you're right about a lot of this. The sucky part is the pics I have with my friends are all really dumb looking and I haven't really traveled a lot.

OCD,fj8wizl,t3_fc0njc,1583124202.0,"I'm glad your mom was able to recover. Also you don't have to worry about being discriminated against when it comes to traveling in the us. There are people from every part of the world here so different cultures are normal. And actually its interesting to most of us learning about different countries straight from someone who has lived there. Also with our current social climate I'm pretty sure in most places you go people would defend you if they heard any discrimination. If anything I'm worried about traveling to different countries cause of how much people hate Americans. Like that guy who commented on americans being ""too dumb to tell the difference"" for example (which I dont think is appropriate seeing as though this is a support sub and we're all supposed to have each others backs).

Discussion,fh8yndg,t3_f1vyyw,1581370068.0,"I think you're seeing being mentally ill as some sort of end all be all type of situation. When it's not. I've dealt with a lot of terrible things myself and have made a lot of progress with my conditions over time. Now, everyone has things that they can improve on internally and externally. And what a lot of people don't understand, or give up on is that it takes time and effort. Of course, there are lots of people who have it really bad, and for them sadly it's just that they don't have the proper help or resources to better manage their conditions. Personally I haven't been in a good state for years, but that's alright. For a lot of mental illnesses the answer isn't to wait for some magical cure or end of your life to come along it's learning to be okay with the fact that you're not always gonna be at 100% and learning to better manage these things. Basically I don't think mentally ill people should be entitled to euthanasia. Internal struggles and learning come along with life. We just have to understand that, improve, and do the best we can to refocus on the good parts."

OCD,fgqu1l8,t3_ezqjin,1581031487.0,"What you're going through definitely sounds like a form of pure-o (purely obsessional ocd). The way that myself and many others have learned to lessen the impact and amount of thoughts is by going through a process called erp (exposure, response, prevention). A good way to get used to the thoughts is accepting that they are there, do not try to understand them but let yourself be okay with not feeling 100% alright. Having a distraction will help with this process a lot. By ignoring the thoughts and feelings it gives you it teaches your brain that the thoughts are nothing you have to worry about. It takes a while and it's difficult but this helps a lot of people with managing their ocd. And has definitely helped me. Good luck.

Side note:
*there are a lot of different pure-o themes. There are probably many people out there that have the same type that you do, but for many pure-o develops differently. You can think of it maybe as a personalized disease."

pureo,fgmvk6v,t3_ezet46,1580932855.0,"I've been exactly where you were before. It takes a while, and some days are worse than others. When you get triggered by something I suggest having a distraction so you can have an easier time not trying to process the thoughts. What I did was let myself feel shitty, but didn't let myself engage in the thoughts (if you try to make sense of the thoughts it's just going to make things worse, because the thoughts come from a completely illogical place and it'll allow your brain to come up with more reasons for things). After that I would forget about whatever triggered me originally, but when the next thought came up (most of the time right after getting over the first one) I did the same process with that one. At first going through all this really is a war in your mind, but when you decide that your just not going to take part in it it's like putting up a wall. The more you do this and let your ocd tire itself out you won't have to keep that wall up as much. For most people things become a lot easier after sticking it out long enough. I know that when you're in a state of panic cause of these thoughts it'll be difficult to focus on a distraction but just keep this in mind. When these thoughts make you feel terrible, but you ignore them and focus on something else it shows your brain that you don't have to fear the thoughts or focus on them as much. This allows the anxiety and amount of thoughts to go way down. From my own experience I was able to go from a ton of thoughts a day to just 1-3 most days, and they don't cause me anywhere near the amount of disruption they used to. You still got a lot of strength, keep working on it, and good luck."
OCD,fgjahz5,t1_fgj5pby,1580840179.0,"*trigger warning*
For most people pure-o makes them believe that they are basically the opposite of who they are. It can make some people believe that they are evil (which would be pocd, or harm ocd), or make them believe that they have changed sexually (trans ocd, homosexual ocd), or it can make them believe that they have other mental illnesses (schizophrenia ocd). Just to give a clear example of how it is to have pure-o I'll share some of my experiences. When I was going through the worst part of my hocd I could barely look at other guys. If I even saw a bit of another guy I would get stuck on reasoning with myself on whether or not I was gay for looking at that (trying to reason with ocd thoughts is a form of compulsion called rumination). Trying to reason with my ocd took entire days, and during those days I would purposefully look at other guys when they appeared on screen to show my ocd that I was not gay (this is a compulsion called checking). But doing that only caused more intrusive thoughts, which resulted in even more rumination and checking. After a while I stopped hanging out with friends because my ocd tried to make me think that I was attracted to them (this is avoidance). The stress ocd would cause me made me suicidal, I would be shaking throughout the day and feel like I had to throw up cause of how bad it made me feel. It wasnt because I had something against homosexuality, but because pure-o made me believe that I was something that I was not. Now the difference I had when dealing with anxiety was that I could not be in certain places or situations or I would think something was gonna happen to me (I also didn't have all the compulsions that came with ocd other than avoidance). For example, if I was in a car I thought I had to get out or I could have a seizure (I have never had one before). Another thing I had was if I was in a big open space with a lot of people I was afraid that a solar flare would finally hit earth (as well as the seizure thing). I would lock myself inside all day, quit my job, and even left school. I avoided the hell out of everything cause the amount of panic and anxiety I would get was too much.  Anyways, sorry for making this so long. I just wanted to give a clear picture of everything. And good luck.

Sidenote:
*there are definitely more pure-o (purely obsessional ocd) themes than I listed. Those were just some of the most well known ones"
OCD,fgj59z8,t3_eyhi0n,1580837240.0,"If you have obsessions without physical compulsions you should look into pure-o. But if you don't deal with any other symptoms it might just be anxiety. I've dealt with extreme anxiety where I couldn't even leave the house for a while cause I thought it would cause some sort of reaction (I won't say here cause I don't want to trigger anyone). Also if there's no solid themes appearing it really might just be a generalized anxiety type thing. But the way to treat/manage both of these is by confronting them. If you're dealing with anxiety you have put yourself through your triggers and learn to come to peace with them (mindfulness and coping techniques can help a lot). When dealing with ocd you can learn to manage everything with a method called erp (exposure, response, prevention). Either way good luck, and if you're able to see a therapist that would probably be the best way to go."
OCD,fg0gb4q,t3_ew8acp,1580407199.0,"You have to learn to accept that the thoughts are there and be okay with not letting anyone know. As well as not engage in the thoughts. While learning to accept these thoughts and not engaging in them its gonna be really difficult. But you have to stick through it. Cause as time goes on it becomes easier to manage, and less intrusive (intrusive as in it wont bother you so much). For me that was a major step in lessening the amount of intrusive thoughts I had. I went from a high number of obsessional thoughts a day to 1. I did this by letting it make me feel shitty, like OCD does. But not trying to process the thoughts it gave me. It's good to have a distraction while doing this. Also, you confessing that you're having these thoughts to people may be a compulsion which will only strengthen ocd cause of 2 reasons. 1, that's what compulsions do. 2, your mom might be giving you reassurance which also strengthens ocd. I'm 18 too, and I know how hard it is being our age and having to deal with all this. It's terrible but we can get through it.

socialskills,ffpx1ww,t3_euj73t,1580109133.0,"I've dealt with this type of thing a lot in the past. And to be honest I'm still not completely through it, but I've learned a lot about myself and how I can start making progress. For myself, and most other people that feel the way you do, it comes from a place of insecurity. Now, while it's okay to feel down about yourself sometimes (cause we are human and it's okay to feel shitty) there's no reason to let this hold you back. There's simply not enough time. So instead of continuing to let yourself feel like a ""creep"" you should start doing things like changing up your hair, getting some cool clothes, or just doing anything that makes you feel like you're improving. I know I'm going into the whole ""love yourself before others can love you"" thing but self improvement helped me move along so much. And since your situation sounds similar to mine I think it would help you as well. For me all it took was a haircut. I went from looking like a demented mushroom, to a well put together gent, and it sort of allowed me to think, ""why have I been thinking that I'm a creep, or undeserving?"" Later on I found out that my insecurities (and some other problems as well) came from a fear of abandonment. When I was younger, in every relationship I had (wether it was just as friends or more) there were things that were never reciprocated. My relationship with my parents were even a loose bond. My reason for putting that bit of info in here is to show that by doing something that made me feel good about myself it allowed me to get a view of the bigger picture. I now know where my insecurities and some of my problems stem from. Now that I have an understanding I can tackle these things instead of staying in a place where I believe that I was just born into this mess. Again, it's okay to let yourself feel bad for a little while. You're human, and it would be unhealthy to just ignore your feelings. But when you finally decide that you're over it (which seems like it to me since you made this post) go put in that work bro XD."
OCD,fe6mnog,t1_fe6maox,1578896142.0,"Well, it's great that you're starting to move forward now. Some therapists aren't too well informed on pure-o, but I'm sure if you explain it they'll be willing to work on it with you. Good luck!"
OCD,fe6m62u,t3_enzp1m,1578895611.0,"Sounds like it. Honestly, now that you feel like you've identified the problem it's best not to wait around and let it develope. Chrissie hodges has some great videos on the different types of pure-o and the method used to manage them (her videos are on YouTube). Also, don't beat yourself up over these things. I know, it sounds difficult. But I've said this to many people before. Allow yourself to be a victim of your ocd not the other way around. It's not you forcing these thoughts onto your ocd. The thoughts are around cause your ocd brought them. And once you let yourself become a victim of it, it'll not only take some of the stress off, but it'll also disconnect you from your ocd as well. It's a parasite, not a pet. So you don't gotta keep it around (also letting yourself be a victim alone won't help. You gotta throw it in there with all the other methods used to manage ocd). 

Side notes:
*I'm not a professional, but I've struggled a lot with pure-o and have built a good understanding of it. Either way you should do some research on pure-o and harm ocd (not on reddit but from mental health channels on youtube, or websites that have done research on things like pure-o and harm ocd)

OCD,fdruw8s,t3_emsanb,1578690166.0,"I've had a lot of success with recovering without a therapist. I have a therapist now, but for the most part we focus on some of my other problems during sessions. I honestly think for a good amount of people putting themself through erp on their own might be the best option. If you're seeing a therapist that isn't somebody who is focused on ocd they might try to find some connection as to why we're having certain thoughts or behaviors when it really is just cause we have ocd. I know from my own experience that it can be really frustrating dealing with that sort of thing and can even put people in a really bad state. I won't lie though it is difficult. But if you put in the work you will see improvement. Good luck.

Sidenote: part of cognitive behavioral therapy is good for ocd treatment but the best option for any form of ocd is exposure response prevention (also known as erp)."
OCD,fdmosry,t3_em43zy,1578558475.0,I don't know if people with physical compulsions do this but for people with pure-o it might not be a really good idea. One of the worst compulsions a pure-o sufferer deals with is seeking reassurance. It's something they do to confirm that they are okay but really it just strengthens their ocd. I thought about how it would be nice to have an ocd group chat before but there's a good chance of it turning into something that only holds people back from recovery. I've seen a lot of reassurance seeking on the subreddit already and for some that's all they use it for. I'm not sure that there's really any way to stop this either. You could make it against the rules but if there are people not following them and you kick them out that may just do more harm in the end. I mean the last thing any of us need is a feeling of abandonment while dealing with this stuff. Well that was just from the pure-o side of it. I hope this helped give a broader view of things.
OCD,fdi67rr,t1_fdi3vdl,1578436446.0,"It's short for exposure, response, prevention. You expose yourself to triggers (let's say you start obsessing over an intrusive thought). You do not engage the thought (engage as in trying to understand it or reason with it), you only accept that it's there and ignore it. Ignoring it will teach your brain that your obsessions are not anything to worry about which will weaken the symptoms of ocd. Ignoring obsessions is way easier when paired with a good distraction. Lastly the prevention, which is simply not allowing yourself to obsess. At first you might wanna say to your ocd ""alright, I'll give you some time to make me feel crappy. But after that I'm moving on."" Then, as difficult as it sounds, move on and dont think about it. Also, kcp12 was right. Pure-o does come with compulsions. It's just that they don't manifest in a physical way."
OCD,fdi3t79,t3_eliicb,1578435237.0,The form of ocd without compulsions is called pure-o (purely obsessional). I don't know much about your theme but it might fit into rocd (relationship ocd). The number one way to fight back against any form of ocd is putting yourself through erp. Hope this helped and good luck.
OCD,fdbscpu,t3_ekgspd,1578261194.0,"When I first started going through pure-o the most intense form it took was hocd. I see you're scared of what erp might bring but I think that's because you're interpreting it the same way alot of other people interpret it (which isnt to say that you and everyone else is incorrect). When I was doing ERP my first step was to get a good understanding of pure-o and especially hocd. Of course, that counts as checking (which goes against erp) but you first have to know the enemy to fight the enemy (make sure you're not checking over and over just to get reassurance, reassurance is one of our biggest enemies). This next part is what I interpret differently than most people. Instead of accepting that the thoughts I had were apart of me I only accept the fact that they were there. I learned to come at peace with the fact that the thought's were there, and the feelings that ocd forced on me were there. Two things that helped with acceptance was having a distraction, and allowing myself to be a victim of my ocd. A distraction helps you not focus on the obsession which will begin to teach your brain that the thought is nothing to worry about. Allowing yourself to be a victim of OCD seperates you from it. Which will definitely give you an easier time accepting that it's there. Cause since it's not you, than who cares what it says. Another thing I did differently was not purposefully expose myself to triggers (for most this is not recommended). I took on my triggers as they came, gave myself the time I needed to come at peace with them and moved on. Then I repeated the process as much as I needed. With time everything lessened and i was able to think straight. I won't lie though, I still get little spikes every now and then but I'm able to deal with it more effectively and I'm not trapped like i was before. I know I may have simplified some things in here but those are just the basic steps I took. I'm at work right now so if you have any questions i can answer them later."

You can do a version of erp (a very effective type of treatment for ocd) where instead of purposefully exposing him to triggers you can instead try to get him more used to things as his triggers come. For example, when a situation like the play doh thing comes up you can explain to him how it would be okay even if it did touch your mouth. And when he wants you to do things like clean your mouth you absolutely cannot. Cause he has to get used to being okay with his triggers. I know it sounds funny since hes a little kid, but try to use logic with him. Dont push the explanations too far but just a little reasoning here and there would definitely help him when dealing with ocd and many other things. I know from experience that good reasoning skills has helped me a lot in my life. Luckily when dealing with young people theoretically it should be easier to help them recover from really anything since their brains are at a really high level of plasticity. But in the end nothing can beat the right treatment paired with a good therapist. Good luck. And if anyone knows anything about treatments for young people with ocd please add onto this or correct me."
OCD,fbhsqc8,t1_fbhnfob,1576881369.0,"There's a couple last points I want to make. You keep using the word if. If you're not sure then it isnt a good idea to jump the gun and do anymore things to yourself when you cant see straight yet. Another point I want to make is deep down you still want help. You may feel at your lowest point right now, but these posts that you make show me that you at least want to talk about this stuff. Be it subconscious or not you still got a fight in you. You're a strong person, strong enough to resist the bullshit ocd has been putting you through so far. Even if you have scars left over or things that still get to you, you've been making it so far. A low point in life doesnt mean it's the end. Anyways, if you want to talk I'm open. I have a good amount of knowledge on pure-o so im sure theres some good pointers I can give you. And if thinking about it as help bothers you then don't. Just think of it as a normal conversation."
OCD,fbhgepb,t3_edcz4a,1576873034.0,"I read a little from your comment history (I dont usually look into peoples stuff so sorry about that) I can relate to a lot of what you've been expressing. Especially to the not deserving help, regret, the self hatred that you may feel, and the suicidal thoughts. All of us with pure-o deal with these things a lot. I know from my own experience that I've lost out on so much because of it. Even now I'm still struggling to really get things moving in my life. But I'm closer than ever before. Since we've gone through very similar things I'll tell you a little about what I went through and how I got over it. I'll also give you some resources that may help you out. When I was in the worst part of my ocd everyday from morning to night I would be bombarded with the worst thoughts, and feelings that I didnt understand. I would think to myself constantly that I'm a piece of shit, I dont deserve to have people in my life, or all the things I have. I thought that i should just stay like that cause my worth as a human being, and literally as a living organism was gone. Much like many others I felt like a monster. So i locked myself away. I would ignore people who approached me, who could've really used my help cause I felt like I would be doing a disservice to them, I let go of my dreams cause I felt like I would be doing a disservice to anyone affected by them. I saw that you've wanted to put a knife to your throat before and many other sadder ways of ending your life. I believe you want it to be in a bad way as a form of self punishment. I know from my own experience that that's how I felt. I've held a knife to my throat and seriously considered doing it 2 times in my life. I've also seriously considered leaving my home and dying on the streets way more than that. I believed that I needed some way to repent for ""everything I had done."" Which I had really not done anything. What i grew to understand with time is that repentance is only an excuse we use to say that we made up for something. If we take something from someone it wont affect them if we then take something from ourselves. What we can do to get over our guilt and improve as people is redeem ourselves. Like I said in my first comment let yourself get better. And I dont mean that just in the way of improving your condition, but at least let that ocd fog clear up so you can think clearly. And maybe during that time help people out. Another suggestion I have for you is doing erp. Right now your ocd seems a bit at an extreme stage. So maybe take on exposures as they come and not force yourself into them. What I did was have a nonchalant attitude toward my ocd. When it threw thoughts and feelings at me I would say to it ""okay, you're here again. I'll let you make me feel what I'm feeling but I'm not engaging in that thought, and after this im moving on."" Having a distraction while doing this works really well. At first its gonna feel like you have to process it to make up for having the thought but even if you're faking being okay you gotta stick with it.

OCD,fbhaorv,t3_edcz4a,1576869204.0,"Hey, I'm not gonna tell you that you're wrong for feeling the way you do. I've seriously considered ending it all so many times cause of my ocd. The shit we deal with is so ridiculously hard, and on top of that a lot of us have to go through it alone. Luckily though we have this community. And since you're apart of it I want to remind you of something. We're all going through this stuff together, some of us are in less intense phases of our ocd, and some of us are in the extremes. What I always think about when I get in a low time is the fact that there are people out there who are in way more intense phases of their ocd than me, and they're still surviving and even improving. So if they can do it why cant I. Another thing that I want you to try doing is allowing yourself to be a victim of your ocd. Allowing yourself to be a victim is usually an unhealthy behavior to get into. But once we allow ourselves to become a victim of our inflictions we can detach ourselves from that. Cause at the moment you're in a state where you think you are your ocd, when I can in fact promise you you're not. Detach yourself from it. Realise that you're the victim of your ocd, and not that your ocd is a victim of you. And a tip for being suicidal that I have is stay curious about the future. Even if you think that something you would want to happen can't there's still a chance. No matter how small that chance is logically speaking it can still happen. Let yourself heal, don't let yourself go, and stick around for the things that haven't happened yet."
OCD,fb3hvn2,t1_fb3f2oy,1576473644.0,"Yeah, I definitely agree with you there. What I mainly used the subreddit for was to find things like best therapies (for example: erp), and affects of pure-o; so I could know what I was dealing with and how I could deal with it. But not everyone can be that clear minded when dealing with this. And I think me researching might have also counted as checking; which definitely goes against erp. It's worked for me, which I'm lucky for. But it really doesn't work out that way for everyone; which is also something I think people need to be aware of. Because checking can lead people down a whole other rabbit hole. Anyways, now that I'm at a point where I'm almost at full recovery I do my best to answer people on here that have legitimate questions, and avoid those who try to get reassurance; which is what I think you may be referring to as the problem (and the reassurance seeking definitely is). Another quick point I would like to make is those who try to support need to be aware of their own comfort levels, and make sure that they're supporting instead of enabling. Those looking for support need to be aware of wether they're truly looking for support, or just feeding their ocd. These things aren't always so clear, but we need to put more thought into this stuff before we engage in risky situations. In the end this community is for support, and Like I said in my last comment. We all function in different ways. If one person manages their ocd better with support (and by better I mean healthier) than they should stay. If they find that doing it alone works more than they should for sure do that (P.s. sorry for the sloppy writing)."
OCD,fb3eymw,t1_fb3d7y3,1576471238.0,"I can definitely see this happening to people. And I've also seen things on here that had the potential to trigger me pretty bad. My point in saying everything in my first response was to give more perspective on the topic. When we're in the thick of things it's difficult to get a clear answer so I was hoping that by having more perspectives on here would help people come to their own conclusion. Wether that conclusion is to leave or stay on this subreddit, I just wanted people to see all sides so they can decide what's best for them. Like I said in my original response, I really dont think op was wrong. Each and every one of us respond differently to our ocd. For some it truly is a better option to leave this subreddit, and for others like myself I think it's best to stay. Either way I think this post as a whole is a pretty important conversation that some may need to see."
OCD,fay5abu,t3_eav11k,1576395084.0,"I think this is only applicable for those looking for reassurance (and even then not completely). By having access to other people's experience with ocd it gives us a chance to better understand our problems, not be alone, and find solutions that we wouldn't have seen if we kept ourselves boxed up. I know from my own experience that this subreddit helped pave the way to my success when I was at the worst state in my pure-o. Without the knowledge from those more experienced in coping with ocd I would still be back at square one. Now my ocd is at such a weak state that I can tell it's gonna be almost non-existent pretty soon. That's what I have to say about why this subreddit is a good resource in general. But for those seeking reassurance on here; all they have to do instead is ask those who dealt with really bad reassurance seeking how they coped with it (or ask in a way that matches their problem more specifically), and I know I'm making it sound really simple. But when dealing with these problems everything takes work. And I cant really explain all it takes here cause I'm just trying to make a quick point. Anyways, I'm sorry if I oversimplified anything. I know what we all deal with is very very difficult. I just wanted people who may need the support to know that they still have the option to get it here. But I'm not saying you're wrong op. What you said might truly work for you, and if it does that's good. Good luck out there everyone."

OCD,farpn4z,t3_eag6g8,1576318728.0,"I'm a guy who struggled with pretty bad hocd. The best advice I can give is accepting whatever ocd throws at you. Not as truth but as something that is there for the time being. What I would do is say to it ""alright, you're here again. I'll let you make me feel shitty, but I'm moving on after that."" After saying that I would let my ocd make me feel whatever it was trying to make me feel, but I would not engage in the thoughts that it threw at me (or the responses it would give me). It's a very difficult thing to do but it's the most important. By not engaging in the thoughts (or ruminating over responses) it stops the ocd from developing obsessions any further. By simply letting yourself feel the anxieties and responses without reacting teaches your brain that there's nothing to be afraid of. Which will weaken those feelings over time. Another thing that helps is having a nonchalant attitude towards the ocd. Even if it's just pretending. When I was struggling the most I would play things off like it didnt really affect me even if I was actually pretty beaten up by my obsessions. I'm sorry that this is going on a little long but I just have a couple more tips. A good way of just letting yourself feel the anxieties without processing is having a distraction at the same time. Distracting myself made dealing with the feelings a thousand times more easier for me. Alright, the last tip is something that I believe is a very important thing when dealing with any mental illness. But has helped me with pure-o a lot. Allow yourself to be a victim. Allowing yourself to be a victim helps you recognize what you're going through, and kind of let's you destress. I really hope this helped you, and good luck."
OCD,faofv7j,t3_ea728d,1576263414.0,"I think with some things it's okay to talk about how they make you feel instead of talking about what they are exactly. I know for myself with some of the problems I have I dont like bringing them up because I feel like I'm giving them more power over myself. What I'm planning on doing because of that is asking my new therapist how I can better cope with things like that and also just talking about the problems I face because of the things that bother me. Cause in the end they don't need to know what yours is specifically, but as long as they have an idea they can help you more and you can get that burden off your chest without needing to fully revisit it. One last thing though, I think normally a therapist would try to know the exact thing that's bothering you. But being open and honest about why you dont think that's beneficial would probably help you get more productive sessions. Cause building that understanding will help them give you what you need."

Also I used to have that fear of other people seeing my thoughts. Let's stay strong and get through this alright. Another thing though; one thing that helps me overcome the guilt is allowing myself to be the victim. I'm not the one making these thoughts or forcing these reactions, it's the ocd. So while I do feel shitty, I'm still the victim here and i will not carry the blame for all this. Now, while we are the victims of our ocd it doesnt mean that we dont have any power over it. What we can do to fight back is come to peace with our ocd. We do this by accepting that these thoughts and feelings are there, then allow ourselves to feel crappy without engaging in the thought (get a distraction and think about that, or something entirely different while engaging in a distraction), after that we move on by not trying to recall what caused the disturbance. It's difficult to do and it'll take a while to improve, but if you stick with it getting better is inevitable. Good luck"

I can't understand it completely, but I see that you're in pain. I know that it sucks and I'm here for you. But seriously, therapy might be able to help a little more. Can we try to find something that works?"" I dont know, maybe something like that. I've been in a lot of bad places in my life and one of the most comforting things is someone who is understanding.

Ever since then I've gone down the path of self treatment and it's been really successful. Dont get me wrong I'm still trying to find a therapist for other things, and to maybe help with my ocd.

I'm not saying that that's the situation you're in; I just thought this quote was a little relevant. Anyways I've felt what you described before. For me it was because I've been alone most of my life. I didn't know how to let people in, or trust people. It took my closest friends 5 years to break down my guard, and I'm still working on connecting with people. So I guess for me it's a matter of having my guard up. Sadly for a lot of people it's because they're dealing with a lot of superficial people, or people they just dont connect too well with. Sometimes it may be best to find new people (which is how I got my closest friends), or try building on some of the relationships you already have going on.

But I never try to think it through. Only if it's just a quick ""whatever, this is my ocd acting up."" But other than that I don't try to understand it. Also what helped me was understanding why I felt like I was losing myself, and why my life wasn't how I wanted it to be. It's because I understood the fact that my ocd wasnt being true to me. When something is true to us it comes naturally. It doesnt cause us to ruminate, or feel bad about it. Oh and it's way easier moving on from a thought if you have a distraction.

I completely understand that fear of being pushed over the edge. A good start is meditation. If you can learn to be more present (which scared me at first) you'll have an easier time with being at peace with everything that bothers you. Which being at peace is a very important step with managing pure-o. What helped me with anxiety was being pushed into things. Not main triggers though (mine was school). I was forced to do things like leave the house, ride in cars, go to restaurants. And with time I got better. Even though it was tough. One thing to remember is don't be hasty. A tiny step is still a step. Also the fact that you are aware of your derealization is really the first step to recovery. Mindfulness can help with that especially. I wont lie though it's been a while since I've started my recovery with all these things. I still struggle with my identity, I still cant go to certain places cause of my anxiety, and pure-o is still a bitch.

Than later on when you're finally able to be more at peace with yourself you have to not engage in the thoughts. I've recently gotten to the stage of not engaging and it's helped turn my pure-o from torture to almost basic intrusive thoughts (basic as in they aren't really affecting me as much). The way that you come to peace with it is having a nonchalant attitude. What I did was say to it ""okay, you're here again. I'll let you make me feel what you're trying to make me feel. Then I'll move on."" It's a difficult thing to do (as many of us know), but as time goes on it'll lessen the blow ocd has on us. Once you start handling what it throws at you better you may be able to just stop engaging in the thoughts all together. And by that I mean not acknowledging them. This does require more effort, but it trains your brain to give you these thoughts less and less. It's like getting one of those eye floating things and resisting the urge to look at them.

Everyone liked me at that job and it kind of felt like a second home. I won't lie, I was pretty much known as the quiet guy. But since I was just being myself everyone found it much easier to accept me. Another thing is that when I finally spoke up. I was of course, nervous as hell.

That person that you may want to talk to, or that's talking to you has their own insecurities, faults, and good qualities as well. In the end we are all on the same level. As for the problem with not having anything to say. At some point in my life I realized that it wasn't about finding something, or planning out how to start a conversation. But rather if I truly felt like saying something. If you see someone and you think in your head, ""I want to be friends with that person. Maybe if I compliment their shoes this could work out."" While it's nice and all you may have not really meant it. Which would most likely just lead to a dull conversation. But when you truly have something to say it'll be a much more natural and productive conversation.

Edit: thanks for the reward and everyone whose adding onto the discussion. I'm glad that we're able to help each other like this."
OCD,f72p5hz,t3_du5c22,1573372574.0,"I hope I am not too late, but are you aware of erp? Also the fact that you're scared of becoming this thing is all the proof you need to confirm that this is your ocd. When I was suffering the most from my hocd I felt the same way as you. I thought about killing myself after a therapist I was seeing kept on insisting that I was gay. The reason why this affected me so much is because my dream has always been to have a wife and kids. Also I knew for a fact that I was not gay. But of course, our ocd does all that it can to make us believe otherwise. I wanted to go back to being my true self. Even now I'm still struggling but at the same time I've improved so much. I don't usually invite someone to message me, but if you want we can talk about it. Tocd is kind of similar to hocd and I've also done a ton of research regarding pure-o so I'm sure I may be able to offer some support. Either way please know that what you're feeling is completely understandable but there is a way to improve. I hope you are doing fine."
OCD,f72jt0h,t3_du5fh0,1573365718.0,Since this seems to be in the beginning stage it might be best to try and stop the habits early. The best way to do this is to not engage in the urges. It may sound difficult but this is basically the treatment for full blown ocd anyways. So like I said it's best to catch it early on when it's not as strong. Good luck.
OCD,f72hdfe,t3_du69ek,1573363121.0,"This is one of the problems I have with telling any therapist about pure-o. They either don't acknowledge it and push their own ideas on you, or they don't really know how to handle it and have the risk of triggering you. So far I've had a lot of progress with self-care, but I know not everyone has the best results when going at it alone. Hell, I wish I did have someone to help. Anyways, I may know something that may help you. I watch these vids from a pure-o advocate on youtube called chrissie hodges. I'll find what video she gives info on later. But the video I'm talking about from her I think offers a service to find professionals experienced in pure-o."
socialskills,f722dow,t3_du3knf,1573352425.0,"Well what helped me not get nervous when talking to girls (and really just anyone) may help you. Instead of looking at them as girls or even as someone who is ""superior"" to you just think of it as ""we're all humans."" We all have our own insecurities, faults, and good things as well. In the end we're all just people. Another thing is that people may sense that you're uncomfortable. Which may come off as you trying too hard. Maybe when dealing with people irl don't initiate a conversation with the ulterior motive of making a friend. Initiate if you just truly want to bring something up. Cause then you'll be able to feel more present in the conversation since it's coming from a natural place. It also may be easy trying to make friends on here and friend making apps. Sorry if this was poorly written, I'm out right now. Good luck!"
Discussion,f70mqma,t1_f6fji08,1573330160.0,"Did you tell them about the hand under skirt thing. If you get down to the details I hope they would listen. It may be nerve wrecking but letting it all out may be the best option. If not stay strong and just tell him to fuck off, or let some other form of authority know."
OCD,f6yitms,t3_dts4zr,1573282080.0,This may be linked to groinal syndrome. Chrissie hodge's video on groinal responses (can be found on YouTube) is a good one to watch.
Discussion,f6ygraf,t3_dtrypo,1573279369.0,If you mean in general then there's no way to really prove or disprove that. It would come down to who's better as an individual. Which would basically result in gender becoming irrelevant.
OCD,f6y6f0j,t3_dtngz1,1573269094.0,"You might have already done this. But you can sit down with her and tell her that you really were not aware of how much it would affect her. Tell her that you're now trying to better understand her condition in order to be a better friend. If this doesn't work and she still feels uncomfortable the best thing to do is respect how she feels. I understand that you said that she's important to your mental health but she is also struggling with her own problems. And as someone who's dealt with 24/7 anxiety at one point I can tell you that when I was forced to be around someone I was uncomfortable with It was torture. At the end of the day we are all human. You made a mistake, and that's okay. But at the same time she is human too. And is going through a rough time. Good luck, and I hope you can go back to being friends."
OCD,f6vsuix,t3_dtbsdk,1573198903.0,"My response might need a trigger warning itself. But with how complicated the mind is. I don't think our obsessions are bound to just one type, or the multiple most well known obsessions. In the pure-o community there are 4 well known obsessions I know off the top of my head. There are at least a couple more. But for the sake of what I'm trying to say let's just say that these 4 are the only one's we acknowledge enough to actually talk about. Just because they're the only one's we acknowledge it doesnt mean that there isnt another mystery obsession out there that just doesn't exist. As I said, Our minds are complicated. Also each person is different. So to answer your question, I think it is possible to obsess over that. Also, sorry if this was poorly written. But as a word of advice. Don't try to find answers. Be at peace with the possibility. And once you're in a stable state again you'll see what is true for yourself and what is not. Hope this helped, and stay strong."
AskReddit,f6vgiaf,t3_dt34gn,1573185556.0,A fire alarm.
OCD,f6ra9d8,t1_f6r86y7,1573097773.0,If you're seeking closure through your thoughts about wether or not you locked the door or didn't that becomes a sort of compulsion. The momentary peace of mind you get when you confirm to yourself that you locked the door is the same as checking the door. It's like getting up from bed and back into bed but just in your mind. Just be at peace with it. Which is easier said than done. But learning to have a type of laid back attitude with these things is the best way to deal with it for most.
OCD,f6qvs16,t3_dsn41k,1573087188.0,"I can't say I blame you for feeling this way. All of us with ocd struggle everyday, all day. I think to myself every day that if someone were to kill me right now all I can do is thank them. But what I find helps me move forward in dark times are the small things in life. Like enjoying a book or watching a movie. If I'm dead. I can't do those things. Also, even though I can barely imagine a future where I live my desired type of life. I think to myself that there still is at least a chance of this happening. There is still a chance that I can have that. However small the possibility is, it's still a possibility. So pretty much out of that small curiosity, I go on in life. Just in case something good happens. I mean rare things happen every day. I'm still existing. So I'm still in that giant lottery for something good to happen. Anyways, sorry if any of that was badly written. I'm just trying to get these ideas to you. But one last thing. I'm glad that you posted here. Letting these shitty feelings out and trying to talk about it means that you're still willing to fight. Even if you're not aware of it. Stay strong. Cause you have been so far. And since us with this struggle don't hear it enough. I'm proud of you."
OCD,f6nxci7,t3_ds7fup,1573002401.0,"Loss of attraction is another part of hocd. Things that may help are not looking at porn (if you do), and not checking for things in general. What I mean by not checking is don't constantly look at women to see if you are attracted to them and don't keep on seeking answers. You have to be at peace with what's going on. Even if you have no anxiety it doesn't mean you're at peace. This next part is a bit ironic but to answer your question you do get your attraction back. When I was experiencing hocd most intensely I had every symptom at the same time and my therapist at the time didn't know what hocd was and kept trying to push being gay onto me. Since you have hocd I'm sure you can understand how traumatic that was. But I was able to find my way out of it.

Edit: also I got it back by first fact checking (like you are doing). Which isn't recommended but after I got the solid info I was ready to go through with the rest of the recovery. Than taking a break off of testing my attraction (no porn, or just checking in general). I also accepted that I was feeling the way I felt and applied my time elsewhere."

OCD,f6njkbu,t3_ds5euz,1572992909.0,"It's not that you're insane. You're just going through a dark time right now. What's good is that you've acknowledged that you are going through this rough time. Now what you can do is search for the proper resources that you can use to help yourself while you are waiting for therapy. Also I know it sucks but I have a strict rule for myself not to get anyone who doesn't really understand ocd too involved. One reason is because they can accidentally enable you which will end up just strengthening the ocd. But another reason is because like you said it hurts them. Trust me, I know it's terrible going through things like this alone. I've done it my whole life. But what I take comfort in is the fact that there are people who care enough about us to want to help. And that we have this community here, with people that understand us. Anyways, stay strong and good luck."
