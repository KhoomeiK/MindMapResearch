COVID-19 Tips from a Haz-Mat Professional, Part 2 -
Understanding the Enemy.

In order to destroy the enemy, we need to understand the enemy. The following definitions are from my Hazmat lesson plans and are adapted to COVID-19.

COVID-19 is a virus. What is a virus? â€“ itâ€™s a submicroscopic protein that can only replicate itself when itâ€™s inside a living organism. Two facts: Virus proteins are surrounded by a layer of fat and they easily stick to things, especially skin. 

Incubation Period â€“ (aka onset time) is the time from exposure until the onset of signs and symptoms. For COVID-19 the incubation period can range from 1 to 14 days, hence the two- week quarantine period. A recent study shows that the median incubation period for COVID-19 is just over 5 days and that 97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.

Contagious Period â€“ is the time that one person can infect another communally. Hard data is still lacking for COVID-19. Unfortunately, it appears that the contagious period can occur during the incubation period â€“ that is, before there are signs and symptoms.

Virility of a virus â€“ is a measure of its contagiousness. Unfortunately, it appears that COVID-19 is more contagious than many other respiratory diseases.

Viability of a virus â€“ is a measure of how long it can survive outside a host organism and be capable of infecting someone. Again, unfortunately early studies have shown that COVID-19 can survive for up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s so important to consider gas pump handles, door knobs, credit card touch pads and basically any surface you touch as being contaminated. 

Infectious Dose - is average number of viral particles needed to establish an infection. Scientists presently donâ€™t know what this is for COVID-19, but given how rapidly the disease is spreading, it is likely to be relatively low.

Remember, together we will all get through this.

methodism,flyp4da,t3_fru3sn,1585606351.0,"I have  obsessive compulsive disorder. It has often caused me to re-read something repeatedly. My brain kept pushing the idea that I misread something. I could easily re-read a single paragraph for 15+ minutes! 

I had to allow myself to feel the anxiety of not re-reading and then continue on. Eventually I was able to retrain my thought process. Perhaps, when you feel the need to read the same passage repeatedly, you could stop and confirm with the Spirit? Maybe ask for guidance on what you are supposed to find or ask for guidance to another passage? The treatment for OCD essentially is to ""let go"" so maybe this is a good opportunity to let go and ask God for direction? (I'm not a doctor)

I'm a first responder who also has a lot of experience with the mental health care system. I suggest you call 911 when you see her acting in a way that puts her and others in danger. Depending on the situation she will probably be transported to a crisis center and be kept for a period for evaluation and stabilization. The thing is, a care plan only works if everyone involved works with the plan. People often stop taking their medicine for many reasons, and then start falling back into the behaviors. By calling, you create a continuing record of how the plan is not working. It may help the relevant agencies develop a different plan."
