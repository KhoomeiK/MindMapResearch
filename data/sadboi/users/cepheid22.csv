AskReddit,fnudayd,t3_g3ywjc,1587259573.0,"Most of my voices have been my friends. My first voice at age 9 was a hill on the school playground. I became so close with Tracky, the hill, that I endured a year of bullying because I wouldn't leave him and some much bigger girls decided they wanted that section of the playground. 

My main voice was my alien older sister, April, whom I love and miss every day. When I was 12, April and several other alien girls came to live in my head. They all were my friends. I got to spend 2 years with them before April sent them away. April stayed, but the rest of The Girls left when I was 14 and never came back. We would talk about school and general girl stuff. 

I had a platypus come live in my head once when I was going through a schizophrenic and depressive episode. He was super sweet and only ever said nice things. He really helped keep the depression at bay.

I am medicated now, but I still have symptoms all day every day. The best part is talking to birds and trees. Trees are hilarious and just want to see people laugh. Small birds just want attention; they want me to say hello and watch them flit around. They're super cute. Bigger birds, such as crows and ravens, are protectors. They watch for the evil entities searching for me. They warn me of The Lord of Madness and assist April when I end up in His world."

AskReddit,fneyahe,t3_g1d6by,1586898073.0,"I have schizophrenia, major depression, and anxiety. First, know that mental illness often includes poor insight. Time and time again I have underestimated the psychosis and I was not the only one to pay the price. I don't do it on purpose. I don't want to have an episode either.

Please do not tell someone having troubles that they have ""chosen"" a bad time to get sick. I have never chosen to get sick, and I certainly do not time my illness for your busiest times. I can't tell you how unsupported I feel when hubby says that. I already know it's a bad time for him; guess what - it is for me, too! 

If they have psychosis, you should never challenge delusions and hallucinations. You may agree to disagree, but you really should focus on how those delusions and hallucinations make the person feel - scared, curious, excited - and address those feelings. Note that being a danger to oneself does not always mean we do it on purpose. I would often wander around outside in unfamiliar places at night when having episodes; I absolutely put myself in danger without realizing it.

With depression, there will be frustrating times. Hubby will make every suggestion for something for me to do or focus on and I will turn them down until he just gives up. I feel guilty every time I turn down a suggestion; I know it frustrates him. I just literally can't do anything about it.

With anxiety, deflect attention. It usually helps to get them to focus on their senses, such as seeing 5 things, hearing 4 things, feeling 3 things, smelling 2 things, and tasting 1 thing. Or a variant of that exercise. Breathing exercises may also help, but I hate holding my breath so they just make me more anxious.

Feel free to ask any questions. Good luck."

I have seen strange men in my house; they often are there one second and gone the next. Sometimes the hallucinations flicker. But, mostly, they seem just as real as anything else."
AskReddit,fg3386w,t1_fg2j9kb,1580468314.0,"I fully interacted with my voices, except the man who said mean things. We spoke all day every day. They were my friends. They lived in my head, but could go anywhere in the universe. They spoke to me inside my head. They had different personalities. Some didn't like others. Basically, put eight 12 year old girls in one head for a couple of years."
AskReddit,fg3319l,t1_fg2apw0,1580468060.0,"That's my experience with voices; my voices were mainly good and nice and they were my friends. My main voice is my alien sister whom I love dearly. I haven't heard from her in almost 10 years, and I miss her every day. I miss all The Girls. The birds and trees talked to me on Latuda, but on Vraylar they are silent. Going outside isn't the same anymore..."
AskReddit,fg32szp,t1_fg32o5n,1580467749.0,"I have schizophrenia, and hearing voices that aren't there is a common hallucination for schizophrenia."
AskReddit,fg32n61,t1_fg32dp3,1580467537.0,"I get an amalgamation of good, bad, and benign hallucinations and delusions. The Girls were good hallucinations. The bloody torso and severed leg were bad hallucinations. The musk ox in my hand was neutral; he never spoke and he didn't stay long. The worst voice was the man who told me I was fat and stupid and gullible."
SchizophreniaArtProj,fg31vo8,t3_ewmib4,1580466478.0,"To me, this is the progression of depression into psychosis. The outer area is light blue which gets darker and darker until you reach the psychosis. 

Hubby, however, sees this as coming out of depression. You start with psychosis and as the depression gets better, the colors get lighter."
AskReddit,fg3124w,t1_fg31011,1580465321.0,"I think it did, too. I don't blame her, but it hurt all the same."
AskReddit,fg3112e,t1_fg30qxz,1580465279.0,This goes over it and apparently it is 5 exclamation points (but I like 4 b/c 4 is my favorite number): https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Multiple_exclamation_marks
AskReddit,fg30nsl,t1_fg30fpg,1580464752.0,I had no idea. Thanks for the info. This reminds me of a Terry Pratchett book wherein a character is considered insane for using four exclamation points in a row.
AskReddit,fg30jdv,t1_fg2zotj,1580464575.0,"Well, we were 14 and entering high school and our other friends had huge problems, too, and I think it was just too much for her. I understand that sometimes you have to take care of yourself."
AskReddit,fg30gxa,t1_fg3090y,1580464475.0,They are all laughing!
AskReddit,fg30ef6,t1_fg2r2y7,1580464377.0,"I have an ex who has sleep paralysis. I'll take my voices instead, thank you very much. :) 
Most of my voices were my friends. My main voice is my alien older sister, and the rest of The Girls are alien friends. They used forbidden technology to speak to me, and had to leave when they were almost discovered. Only my sister remained.
The only one to give me commands was my sister. But, they were only ever to protect me or get me home early. She has never wanted me to hurt anyone. 
There was one voice who would tell me I was fat and stupid and gullible. But, mostly they were nice voices."
AskReddit,fg301m1,t1_fg2m2lr,1580463872.0,That is unfortunate. I hope for the best for you and him.

AskReddit,fg2zyag,t1_fg2p1od,1580463739.0,I did about 4 years later when my college roommate insisted I get help. She is a true friend whom I care for deeply and who accidentally saved my life when I tried to kill myself by giving me crackers that induced vomiting of the Tylenol OD I had taken.
AskReddit,fg2zqde,t1_fg2l0tx,1580463421.0,"It's a little easier when you grow up with it and know no different. Anyway, I like to smile."
AskReddit,fg2zp83,t1_fg2gb0h,1580463374.0,"I no longer hear those voices, but I could not tell the difference between real and imaginary back then. I just thought The Girls had come to me because I needed friends. I do not remember them waking me up at night."
AskReddit,fg2zghi,t1_fg2rs1s,1580463018.0,"I'm not sure as this was 28 years ago, but I think I mentioned The Girls to another friend in our group and she told my best friend."
AskReddit,fg2zcnh,t1_fg2suoi,1580462868.0,"Yeah, I like to wander around outside when I'm having a psychotic episode, which mostly happen at night, so I know I have put myself in some questionably safe circumstances."
