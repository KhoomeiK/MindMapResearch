CaregiverSupport,fkwjl16,t3_fl3v5v,1584594482.0,"I feel the same way. (I‚Äôm a woman) but I do the same things for my husband. I cook, clean, work, he works as well but it‚Äôs like when it comes to being intimate I just am too tired or I‚Äôm just not in the mood after having to take care of people all day. It‚Äôs really hard for me to want to do that when I‚Äôm exhausted and I feel like I‚Äôm the only one doing anything around the house you know? It‚Äôs sometimes just a small resentment I have which isn‚Äôt right and isn‚Äôt fair but it‚Äôs how I feel sometimes.

I would suggest maybe seeing a therapist yourself to be able to talk through some of the things that are difficult for you. And making sure your head space stays strong. You can‚Äôt pour from an empty cup. Many al anon meetings can be helpful? I am not 100% sure if they will help your situation but it is still a support group that could be helpful. I bought my bf and I the DBT self help guide and we are working through it. It‚Äôs super easy and helpful. You can get it on amazon for $22. Amazon has tons of resources. Maybe look into Facebook groups? Or even start your own! I wish you so much luck and happiness and success!!"

TrueCrimeDiscussion,fd5i6nz,t1_fd52l0e,1578177926.0,"Thank you for looking into that and doing the research. I really appreciate it. There are only 4 exceptions to the moratorium. 
Citing from Wikipedia 

On August 01, 2019, Governor Kate Brown signed a bill that restricts the death penalty to four cases:

(1) acts of terrorism in which two or more people are killed by an organized terrorist group 
(2) premeditated murders of children aged 13 or younger 
(3) prison murders committed by those already incarcerated for aggravated murder 
(4) premediated murders of police or correctional officers"
TrueCrimeDiscussion,fd5he3v,t1_fd51z4l,1578177667.0,"Thank you for doing all that research and spending the time to look into it! I really appreciate it! I am doing my first podcast on him, and so much information on him is misleading... not just the execution thing, I mean everything from his birthday to his trials, it‚Äôs confusing. I wrote the Clackamas sheriff and asked for the case file and got a letter saying  my request had been sent to the DA pending approval, which who knows how long that will take. So I decided to skip the middle man and ask him about some simple things like his date of birth, place of birth etc. and I got a letter back."
TrueCrimeDiscussion,fd4ys96,t1_fd4y7jd,1578172495.0,"If that‚Äôs true why is Wikipedia the ONLY place that says it? And again, in a state where I live, and I know full well that we do not have the death penalty.

TrueCrimeDiscussion,fd4xwwh,t1_fd4wvhc,1578172198.0,"Wikipedia is wrong, and it‚Äôs the only site that says he was executed. Again, Oregon does not use the death penalty.

There are reports from newspapers in 2015 from his trial and court documents from his 2015 trial where he spoke. He‚Äôs alive."
TrueCrimeDiscussion,fd4wpxh,t1_fd4vtfo,1578171777.0,"Impossible. How could he have been executed in a state that doesn‚Äôt have a death penalty? I live in Oregon and we don‚Äôt have the death penalty here except for 4 exceptions and his crimes don‚Äôt fall under any of them. Also, how could he have been sentenced to death again in 2015 if he was already dead? Plus there‚Äôs a video that was published by the Oregonian in November of 2015 of him https://youtu.be/_1_zZmsrYeg"
TrueCrimeDiscussion,fd4w3uk,t1_fd4pgdo,1578171588.0,Basically that he doesn‚Äôt do interviews and if I want to get to know him as a friend that‚Äôs fine and he wants me to give him my number so he can talk to me on the phone.
