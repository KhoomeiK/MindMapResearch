Omaha,fqu09lr,t1_fqpizum,1589649516.0,I'm with you on that. DnB has been a big part of my life since 1997ish and over the years with the scene in Florida I've been to many shows and kept me feeling young üòÅ
Omaha,fqu033h,t1_fqpg38l,1589649416.0,Thank you! When things are back to normal I'd love to attend.
Omaha,fqnuvo9,t1_fqno09l,1589501863.0,I'm definitely missing it and it makes me homesick lol.
Omaha,fqjgz2l,t3_gba3s3,1589409809.0,I have and it's sustainable and works. I'm just horrible about sticking to the lifestyle with kids and stress etc. There's a Ketomaha group on FB and I think another one or two.
Omaha,fqjdm8j,t1_fpjyfcm,1589408458.0,"This, and I also add extra Ranch powder. I buy the big containers of it :D"
Omaha,fqjcrx1,t1_fq8i4ev,1589408118.0,South Florida girl here. Definitely not as bad humidity up here than there. This wind is definitely crazy though!
AskReddit,fnjc13e,t3_ft8y0o,1586995942.0,My kids have it and the only downside I have seen so far is not being able to turn off the notifications. Even with the iPads muted and clicking notifications off the call and message tones still come through. Usually my kids will just message each other. I like that parents have to add them as someone they can talk to before they're able to contact each other.
aerogarden,fm1ktoq,t3_frii95,1585680249.0,Thank you! Also thanks for everyone who helped get it back. I do agree with maybe adding a few people that have high post count in this community or are active :)
AeroGardens,flyz1mb,t3_fq57ny,1585612026.0,I put my dome in foil and stick it there upside down.
AeroGardens,flyyza9,t3_foawwt,1585611987.0,I have a 9 pod Bounty as well as the 6 pod Harvest.
aerogarden,fkerhsz,t1_fke8lqt,1584119160.0,Thanks! üòä
aerogarden,fkdjsqg,t3_f3grve,1584081534.0,"I'd be interested too, thanks :) I tried doing an IG message but I didn't see a place for it for some reason."
aerogarden,fkdjluo,t3_f7j1rg,1584081313.0,I was gifted a Harvest (6 pods) for Christmas and used the default herbs. The thai basil would have taken over the whole thing but I am aggressively pruning it and might just plant it outside since I don't use it. My Genovese basil is doing nicely and so is my dill. I have one unit for my herbs and I am adding a 2nd for lettuce and tomatoes.
ASUSROG,fjiw09u,t1_fj52hj8,1583377031.0,"Currently it won't turn on with the 2700 plus the video card (Radeon RX 570) though it will run with my older Nvidia but I don't get any video. I have a 700 PSU and have tried with an 850, same issue. Now it will run with an AMD Athlon 200GE that has onboard graphics with no issue so I was just able to update the bios. I haven't tried with the AMD and the video card yet."
ASUSROG,fj5gyhr,t1_fj5c0mr,1583032425.0,This is the same exact issue I had. I'm thinking of getting a lower model to flash bios so I can use my 2700.
depression_help,ffeniyw,t3_et532b,1579855965.0,"Way to go, baby steps! üíó"
techsupport,fej2opq,t1_fehtj2f,1579154660.0,Exactly part of my confusion for sure. Its a 2nd brand new board and the first one did the same thing. I have rebuilt the box multiple times with all different parts.
techsupport,fehs1w9,t1_feg7q77,1579122741.0,None of them are solid. The yellow/green one doesn't even flash. It's a quick white flash followed by a longer yellow and red flash.
techsupport,feg798j,t1_feg4n9p,1579080323.0,"Hi, thank you. I have tried all 3 gpu slots with the same issue. I have also rebuilt the box about 4 different times with everything secure. The lights flash white, yellow and red. It's definitely frustrating not being able to figure this out after years of building boxes."
Omaha,fefm0ij,t3_enan7n,1579059207.0,"I moved here in August 2017 from South Florida and it has really been a great place to raise my family. While there isn't as much to do as there is back home the cost of living here is less as is our car insurance, groceries and other things. The biggest change for us is not having much family here and missing the beach and clubs when we were able to get out for date night. I don't mind the drivers compared to home, people are nicer, neighbors are neighborly, schools have been awesome and my kids are thriving. We enjoy the snow but dislike the wind and we're still learning about which restaurants are worth the try."
Omaha,fefl3ur,t3_enyrir,1579058629.0,I enjoy the taco salad from Roja and also liked the Caesar salad at Charleston's.
Motherboard,fefj51p,t1_fefg9lo,1579057414.0,"Thank you, I have considered going with the Tomahawk and was trying not to RMA another board but I may have to."
Motherboard,fefg5uv,t3_eh2tzj,1579055629.0,"I am having the same exact issue on a brand new build. The same thing was happening with my Asus Tuf gaming 450 motherboard as well and we thought it was DOA and I ordered the Rog Strix. I have contacted AMD with all of my info, receipt of purchase for my CPU and everything so I can get a bios boot kit from them. I think maybe the bios can't support the 2700x but I don't have another compatible processor."
Omaha,fdrb2iw,t1_fdr6wd7,1578681988.0,No problem! :)
Omaha,fdr6zga,t3_elpd5j,1578680316.0,I have heard great things about the artists over at Eye Candy. I was going to be getting one done there but some personal things came up and I have to reschedule for sometime later.
Omaha,fdr6ua9,t1_fdr5w3t,1578680228.0,You need a band to drink so even if she isn't the legal limit she can partake in the games if you wish to go.
Omaha,fdr5tsa,t3_elyk55,1578679854.0,One of the first places hubby and I went when we moved here was Beercade :) The bottom floor is unlimited games with entry fee which was cool and both floors have a bar. There is also Medieval Putt out west which we haven't made it out to but wanted to check out.
Omaha,fcz7egh,t1_fcvwnf9,1578095177.0,I feel Sweet Tomatoes is one of the reasons my kids are such good eaters. They always tried new things there.
Omaha,fcphyxo,t3_ei94rz,1577864829.0,Amazing salad bar buffet. Back home there was Sweet Tomatoes but nothing I've found here.
Omaha,fbnd8u3,t1_fbjz83k,1576996004.0,"As a South Floridian I have to agree. I've only been here since summer 2017 but overall life has been better here for my family. People are nice, traffic is nothing compared to down South and I love the seasons."
Omaha,fbd3w58,t3_ec5lif,1576745451.0,I've been with T-Mobile since about 2003 and both times I left them for better deals I've regretted. Sometimes I have slow notifications in spotty areas but overall no issues since they opened up stores here. They usually have the cheapest unlimited plans too.
Omaha,fbd3jbj,t1_fbbrar6,1576744951.0,Sadly I don't. South Florida where I'm from has horrible drivers. My anxiety is sky high when I visit home and Omaha is so much more lax than there.
mashups,f9t19dy,t1_f9gei7e,1575605796.0,That's what I thought of too
homesecurity,f4n9azu,t1_f4idg4a,1571687099.0,Thank you. I am renting and am trying not to mount anything anywhere if possible. We do plan on implementing outdoor cameras and lights once we buy the house but for now it isn't ours and we don't previously have permission to mount.
AnxietyDepression,f4n7dqb,t3_dkzoxn,1571686509.0,"People that have their own self hatred will bully others. It isn't on you, its on them. I also agree with not using social media platforms that allow strangers to comment on your posts. Happy birthday and hang in there!"
ketorecipes,f4i8vyk,t3_dkcgzg,1571601351.0,This is amazing lol Thanks for sharing!
Omaha,f3o932r,t1_f3o3yhs,1571011609.0,"I mean...it IS called Johnny's Italian steakhouse, silly me for thinking the chicken parm may be decent ;) I am not from here and trying to venture out to new places. The waiter shrugging off my polite dislike is enough for me to not go back. I have yet to try Mangia though my husband enjoyed it. I have never heard of Avoli Osteria but will be sure to check it out, thanks."
Omaha,f3bpu2f,t1_f39xn66,1570814558.0,I love Davlo's üòä
Omaha,f3bpk5c,t3_dgam42,1570814434.0,I'm newer to the state but am a big TexMex fan.
Omaha,f3b55i8,t3_dgam42,1570801920.0,"I frequent Charred burger, it's pretty good. I also like Roja Mexican food and they have happy hour."
Omaha,f3b4ctl,t3_dg6fw7,1570801319.0,"Layers, lots of layers üòä We bought so much winter stuff after moving from Florida and it wasn't the right balance. Layers are definitely the way to go to keep you warm, the wind makes it colder and I was miserable the first winter.

There's a lot of indoor stuff to do so if you get stir crazy there's alternatives. The zoo is a favorite, they love the penguins.

When moving here we found a place based on the school district. We didn't see the place before moving in, just some pics of the listing. We're out in Elkhorn and very pleased with the school. People in Omaha are amazingly nice too."
Omaha,f3b3kbj,t1_f3agy9p,1570800696.0,"Same, I gave it a chance. I enjoyed Bailey's though for breakfast."
Omaha,f3a7an2,t1_f39l5cx,1570763560.0,180 and Pacific Chi is decent and I'm a Chinese snob.
Omaha,f3a75f2,t3_dg3kgp,1570763451.0,"I might get hate for this but I wasn't impressed with Leavenworth Cafe. The waitress had an attitude with me, staff was arguing in front of customers and I had issues with my food. 

Johnny's steakhouse was pure crap. I took one bite of my chicken parm and they didn't even offer to take it off the bill or make something else. Worst $120 I've ever spent at a restaurant. 

Malara's was ok, the broccoli and cheese bites were gross, I prefer Lo Sole Mio better."
Omaha,f3a6rr4,t1_f38ozwk,1570763169.0,Ah man I loved Stella's and Charred. I wasn't a fan of Dinkers though I tried.
Omaha,f291f34,t3_d6z2hp,1570077045.0,"Hi, check Davlo's. It's delicious deep fish I prefer over Giordano's and you could ask them to make it in a dish without the crust or just eat the filling. I've yet to find any decent alternative for crust and just deal with the toppings."
Omaha,f28zgnu,t3_dbwiq4,1570075146.0,It's available in Elkhorn but we were getting dialup speeds and canceled within the week. I'm hoping they get better speeds here because I'm tired of Cox with their prices and non-service.
wow,f1tm01x,t3_d8uub8,1569746372.0,Still broken. Have tried to re-transmog and everything.

ketorecipes,f18yhbf,t3_d7lj23,1569265255.0,Check out Netrition. They deliver to Canada and have good syrups and other low carb and keto goodies.
ketorecipes,f18y6yb,t1_f118qai,1569265132.0,I also use Sola for this. My local Hy-Vee carries it.
ecobee,f0eygt0,t3_d4nvn8,1568575344.0,Thank you everyone. I was able to set it to cool only. I didn't see that option from the browser in my phone but once getting to my computer it was there. You've been a great help!

ketorecipes,ezwde8j,t3_d2igga,1568214057.0,I definitely prefer them fresh üòä
Omaha,ezvnrkz,t3_cxh2ri,1568186610.0,I had T-Mo when moving here 2 years ago (had them 13 years) and switched to Sprint because of lackluster service in the area. Now that stores are popping up our service has been better than it was and we went back to them. I prefer them as a company/prices compared to the others.
ketorecipes,ezvmz6h,t3_d26jih,1568185422.0,Those 'tatoes' look ah-mazing!
ketorecipes,ezvmxyl,t3_d2igga,1568185372.0,Yum! I make this often and its a favorite! I keep bags of the frozen pepper stir fry (cut red and green peppers and onions) for a quick meal. I use fresh garlic and once in awhile I will add in a little sugar free ketchup and simmer it for a bit.
Omaha,ey20vnz,t3_crgwdi,1566719263.0,"I've only lived here 2 years but chose West Omaha for the schools. While I feel we're in a safe area, crime can happen everywhere. As with any place, research."
Omaha,ey1ymhm,t1_exlip1e,1566716606.0,Charred is amazing and my favorite place so far since moving here. I have yet to try Stella's but hear it's awesome as well.
ketorecipes,eutjvu1,t1_euhv7x5,1564026907.0,Agreed! I love the gnom-gnom recipes and it makes me sad someone is stealing them without giving credit just for YouTube subscribers.
mildlyinteresting,et8ud0f,t3_cafwwq,1562570597.0,This would be a hit for ketoers
keto,et8u2bl,t3_caakv9,1562570189.0,I can drink liquor on keto but I only do it once in a while. I don't get stupid drunk or I will eat everything but it will stall weight loss for sure until it's out of your system.
