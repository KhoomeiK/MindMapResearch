GERD,fqe0kc6,t1_fqdubpt,1589299769.0,"Talk to your doctor for sure too, cause she may want you to do something else. I am not a doctor, just a fellow long-suffering GERDist."
GERD,fqdndlr,t3_gia79x,1589293168.0,"I might actually ask before getting off completely, especially if you still have some symptoms. I’ve been on for a few months and still have symptoms, and my doctor seems to want me on them indefinitely. I would at least check, maybe switch to the over the counter until you can get an answer. Good luck!"
GERD,fqdmv0u,t3_gia79x,1589292887.0,Did the doctor tell you to get off the PPI or are you just trying it?
Anxiety,foe72wd,t1_fodqobn,1587697343.0,"The point about breathing with diaphragm, not upper chest, just hit me. I feel like all I have been doing is forcing myself to take big, deep chest breathes because of the tightness. My chest keeps getting tighter and I’m getting some burning and discomfort on breathing. Maybe I am stressing the muscles in my chest by not breathing normally."
GERD,focnxbv,t1_focft6v,1587673613.0,"I completely relate to what you both are saying. I felt sick all the time. It’s also zapping my energy and messing with my anxiety. We will all get through this, it just sucks right now."
Anxiety,fobr33a,t3_g6ph9h,1587662754.0,"I basically got used to “ok my heart is racing, it’s panic not a heart attack” but to have it not seem to increase at all, or at least very little, really freaked me out. I was convinced it meant my heart was dying due to a heart attack. Yet again, it wasn’t. 

It sometimes feels like as soon as I get used to my panic attacks where I can start to rationalize them and get through it, they switch up symptoms on me to make me second guess myself and worry it is a medical condition. It really feels my panic attacks evolve to fight me."
Anxiety,fobdoyi,t3_g6ph9h,1587658750.0,I mean it’s 70-80 beats per minute on a check. Using my throat or wrist and a blood pressure monitor.
GERD,fo5ncoc,t3_g5u7gl,1587530048.0,"Literally dealing with it right now. The tightness makes it feel like I can’t breath and my whole torso seems to be sore, especially as I move or change positions. Honestly is so troubling, especially the tightness and breathing, makes my anxiety sky rocket that I need to go to the hospital. That maybe my heart or lungs are having an issue."
Anxiety,fo5kwza,t3_g5u933,1587528190.0,I also need to stop googling symptoms because it doesn’t help usually and I’m going crazy. I just want to feel less sick.
GERD,fnra4sm,t1_fnr7kf7,1587183127.0,Yes. Although I feel it more when I swallow than when I breathe. But it makes me feel like it’s messing with my breathing. Also having some burning on deep breaths.
GERD,fnlwuyx,t1_fnkoh1w,1587061130.0,"Anxiety and GERD are truly like evil twins. So related, such a vicious cycle."
GERD,fne1z98,t3_g15f3m,1586881642.0,"The something stuck in the throat is my most common symptom lately. Along with some random chest pains (not burning) and gurgling in my chest and throat. I think I hate the stuck feeling more than the burning, because it feels like it messes with my breathing."
Anxiety,fndxk0m,t3_g17nei,1586879348.0,"I have actually been eating a much better diet. I’ve lost over 40lbs in the last 2 months and have been exercising. Been watching my diet for acid reflux too. Cut out all caffeine and alcohol. I really only drink water and camomile tea. My acid reflux has actually been under control for a few weeks now until last night. Got the gurgling and stuck feeling in my throat which continued into today. 

I thought that about Wellbutrin too but I guess it can work for both. I trust my pc, plus I have actually felt pretty good the last couple of weeks so I do think it has been helping. 

It just feels like I have a stomach flu without the fever. In fact I have had lower temperatures these last few months. 96’s-97’s. I was 96.8 last night and this morning. 

I’m sure it’s anxiety but it just sucks feeling sick like this, especially right now."
GERD,fmp49hf,t3_fwc8fp,1586274150.0,"I absolutely understand why you would make this rule. My question is what if they change it slightly and the post is “I have these symptoms, are these similar to what any of you with GERD have experienced?” Someone who is looking to find people with similar symptoms that have a diagnosis could be helpful, but not a definitive answer that none of us are qualified to give, especially during these times where it is difficult to see a doctor. Would these types of posts still be allowed or is that too close to a diagnosis post?"
GERD,fmi13yv,t3_fvahkq,1586100113.0,"Yes, have been dealing with this for a few months now. I am now on Wellbutrin for my anxiety for the last couple of weeks. It is helping, but I still have my moments. The anxiety also makes my acid worse, so it’s a vicious cycle. I think it is slowly getting better, but I’m not sure my GERD is. Just trying to get through these times until I can actually go in and see a doctor and have some tests to see if I have a hiatal hernia or something else. Maybe see if you can get a virtual visit to discuss with a doctor? I am having a virtual therapy appointment soon too. Hang in there."
GERD,fm9db5m,t3_ftvpwi,1585866410.0,"My symptoms are only in the last few months, but it is definitely affecting my breathing and causing a cough. Which, as you said, now is the worst time for that. Absolutely doesn’t help my anxiety. It completely sucks, I’m sorry you have had to deal with it so long. 

I can relate to the burning going away being in medicine, but now it’s sharp pains and tightness. Feels like something is stuck in my throat and I also have really frequent bubble feelings but rarely can burp. Plus the breathing and cough stuff. Here is to hoping we can all get to the doctor in May!"
GERD,fm9c8vx,t3_ftq5un,1585865810.0,"I can definitely relate. Today it was less burning but I had horrible tightness in my chest/throat. Felt like something was stuck in both mixed in with sharp pains, cough, metallic taste. I coughed so hard a couple of times I dry heaved. I completely feel your pain. Been rough."
GERD,fm9bydd,t1_flzpsqy,1585865644.0,"I have always been a bad sleeper, but it’s even worse right now. I still can’t completely shake something is seriously wrong with me, which ramps my anxiety up of course. My acid is bad at night, plus now it seems like every time I go to fall asleep, my heart stops or I get a jolt and I snap back awake again. Takes me hours to fall asleep. I try to read or something until I literally can’t keep my eyes open. I will keep working on my sleep. 

Today my chest pains were so bad, feels like something is just stuck blocking my chest and throat. Less burning, just tightness and sharp pain."
