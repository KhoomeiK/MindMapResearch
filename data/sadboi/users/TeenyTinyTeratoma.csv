3. Honestly, and I'm not joking, check in with your doctor for any mental health things. Forgetfulness, if not selective, can mean other things. Consider it last if other areas of your life have also been affected.

Healthyhooha,fjw153b,t1_fjvtn36,1583633260.0,"I'm literally, actually welling up at your reply. It makes my WEEK that I have bestowed any amount of knowledge to a young girl out there struggling with these things.

So other things you asked about:

Yes, absolutely seek out tampons with an applicator. Ont let people tell you it's wasteful or unnecessary or any of that. It's mostly garbage advice for a young girl. When you're 20 or whatever you can make sure your period needs align with the planet. For now, take care of your anatomy in whatever way suits you best. I would recommend something like Tampax Pearl or whoever makes gnetle glide. Start with the smallest (lite/ultra light/whatever it's called for the brand) and work your way up if you need more absorbency. It will be about the size of a middle or index finger. Change it absolutely no longer than every 8 hours. If you do not saturate the smallest tampon in that time I would recommend waiting on tampons and using pads instead, changing every few hours. Note that the scented ones are garbage and you should never use scents near your vulva. Wash with warm water and a cloth and if you must use any use unscented soap in an ultra small quantity.

As far as stretching your vagina, LUBE!! Buy some, put maybe two drops (a little goes a fucking long way) and rub it at the entrance of your vagina and a little on your inner labia (if you haven't, learn proper vaginal anatomy, AND USE IT!!) and use one finger from there. You will most likely be shocked at the difference and Probably be able to use two fingers almost immediately.

Sex will be pleasurable eventually. Personally I've only had one orgasm from exclusively PiV, however I take care of myself during by using a vibrator in conjunction. I wouldn't recommend this right away, but consider it for the future. Sex is so intimate, and most would consider it necessary for a functional adult relationship. But that can mean anything for you. That may mean oral every now and then, it may mean no sex ever, and it may mean PiV every other day. There is no standard and you just need to figure out what your sexual needs are as you develop and grow and age. For me it's once a week but I bring myself to orgasm at least obce every few days with my Hitachi magic wand or a strong water pressure in the bathtub. Again, everyone is different. I cannot cum with my fingers. It's fine and I know what floats my boat!


I have used probably thousands of tampons at this point in my life and I have never seen one break. If you want verification look online at the anatomy of a tampon. The string is woven/braided all the way through and does not ever pull on one part like it seems when it's dry.

One more thing you didn't ask about but still: never, ever let someone make you do something you don't want to. If you don't want to give head, say so and don't do it. Personally I don't like giving head and do it sparingly. When I DO give head, I absolutely cannot tolerate my own head/face being puahed down. I find it demeaning and porn-y and I exist in a porn-free relationship. If you get to where his penis head is at the entrance of your vagina and you change your mind, speak up. Say the word ""no"" and if they don't stop you raise hell girl. You push yourself physically out of that situation if you have to. Protect ourself and your emotions because they're most important. Always no matter what any boy or girl says. Blue balls can be fixed by him leaving and masturbaying. You do not exist to give other people sexual gratification. Ever.


YOU ARE A FUCKING WOMAN WARRIOR. You are doing everything and more to be in touch with your body and your emotions. Keep it that way!

Also use a condom no matter what. No ifs, ands or buts. Always. Also periodically consider your moral stance on seeking help in different capacities if you do become pregnant. I got pregnant on birth control and pulling out. It happens more often than people like to believe. Keep yourself safe. You deserve it.


If I missed anything keep it coming! I am more than willing."
Healthyhooha,fjvkdv2,t3_ff3x6i,1583628091.0,"So these are amazing questions to ask if you don't know the answer! I'm going to address a few things:

1. If you have never had any form of sex (oral, vaginal, anal) with either a man or a woman, you are a Virgin.

2a. Regarding fingering yourself: it will probably be tight for a while, and it will not be easier or ""looser"" (see more below) until you work on stretching it. You will want to have done this before you ever have PiV (penis in vagina) sex if or when that happens. However, there is no practical reason to force it if you are just self-experimenting and curious about your own anatomy.

2b. Your vagina will never permanently stretch out. It can get used to accommodating larger and differently shaped things, but it will never get loose and then just be loose forever. That's a myth. Some women are born with a larger vagina or different anatomy that allows for easier sex, and some women have to have a very minor surgery to so much as use a tampon. If you can insert a tampon or a finger without major pain this  is not you so don't worry.

3. What exactly was the mission using a tampon without blood? While not inherently unsafe/dangerous, it is highly unnecessary, and uncomfortable ESPECIALLY upon removal, for even the most veteran tampon user. There should be at least minor flow to justify putting a tampon in there. If it was because you worried about bleeding, look into panty liners or even lighter pads so you can see blood first THEN switch to tampons for the rest of your flow if that is your preference!

Amazingly good on you for asking these questions, and keep them coming if you have more!!"
