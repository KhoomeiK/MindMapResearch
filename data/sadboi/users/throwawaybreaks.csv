plantclinic,fo68y3m,t3_g5ydbw,1587550995.0,"this looks saprotrophic in my experience, is this a recently rooted cutting or did it suffer damage in repotting?

when there's damage to the stem you get layers of the epidermis dying off and shedding, like when you get a cut and it scabs off. the dead material on the outside gets eaten by saprotrophic molds (eaters of the dead) and it looks like its harming the plant but like maggots on mammals it only eats dead bits.

that being said, abscesses can form and trap parasitic molds and bacteria. i've overeacted in the past and gone nuclear with neem oil, alcohol based sprays, chemical antifungals, and generally they do more damage to the plant than just letting it sort itself out.

i'm not promising it'll be fine but i've had plants look like this at transplant and still have long and happy harvests of tomatoes, chilis or other whatevers.

if its really freaking you out, just use a gentle green soap wash, flush the grow media, and irrigate it really well afterwards, see if you can raise the temp in the enclosure, introduce some airflow (open window or a fan) and try to lower the humidity a little bit.

if its what i think that should be enough to take care of the issue :)"

BPD,fjg661p,t3_fda1fr,1583313337.0,"all the damned time.

i suspect the general instability in BPD is caused by instability in the capacity for self-love. 

I have two modes: sensible self talk in which case i'm pretty conceited because i spent my entire life trying to overcompensate for my flaws since i didnt get how to fix them, and now that im making progress i'm pretty happy with who i am as a person on a day to day basis. i think thats just how normal people feel.

The other mode is when something has me stressed or anxious and my brain is like ""we used to stress out when XXX was abusing us and it always got really bad"" and replays all the physical/verbal/whatever abuse in my head and my self talk becomes every insult ever screamed at me and its not really like i am in control of the conversation in my head, im definitely not anywhere near the moment, and the only things i can think are things people screamed at me while abusing me.

you ask if self splitting is a thing, im no qualified professional but i have to say as a long time BPD-user i feel like it's where the problem behaviors usually begin.

all the other shit, annointing an FP to externalize all our positive feelings onto, the over the top outbursts when we feel threatened, its all just he echoes of abuse and trauma responses taking over for actual intentional and wilful composure. 

i think its just whether the person or the abuse is steering the self talk."

learning to deal with that and provide for emotional needs in appropriate and constructive ways was the hardest thing for me to think about, and learning to emotionally care for myself was mostly me fucking up while overreaacting to my own fuckups.

i dont know if i have a fucking point, so heres maybe a good first step instead: just practice positive self talk. i'm pretty sure that was the thing that first got me any traction on the road to being a better person, as much as i constantly doubt myself, the problem behaviors largely went away on their own when i just stopped engaging in actively hating myself in my internal monologue. you got this."
