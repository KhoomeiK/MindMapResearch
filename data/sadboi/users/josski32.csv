maybe it has something to do with being inspired by the use of your auxiliary in others. personally i feel a very strong pull towards xxFPs when they express themselves in whatever way.

I think our relationships with our auxiliary function is a really interesting one. we can be really good at it, almost as good as using our dominant (although it will never come as easily to us as our dom) but it can also get forgotten/neglected. maybe seeing other people use our aux reminds us of how much we want to be using our aux."

PCOS,flj7m6q,t1_flj27zq,1585201543.0,"hoping this isn't too blunt; if you are angry all the time I would be careful to attribute it solely to higher testosterone. men probably have much higher levels than you or I and many of them aren't angry most of the time. I also don't think suppressing your emotions is necessarily a side effect of testosterone.

I used to be extremely angry all the time and it was a very obvious trauma response, which is getting better as I heal from that while the testosterone levels have not changed.

there are different kinds of trauma and nearly everyone leaves childhood with some good coping mechanisms and some bad ones, not to mention there are many things besides your childhood that could be causing it, such as consistent violations of your boundaries for example. it might benefit you to take a look into therapy or forms of self healing, a good place to start is the book ""You can heal your life"" by Louise hay :)"

CPTSD,flid00b,t3_fowk2x,1585179967.0,"this resonates with me so much, and it reminds me that all of my supposedly negative trauma responses were just me adapting to my environment. I learned to be defensive with others instead of open, I learned to be on edge constantly and never allow myself to be calm, and I learned that it is better to conserve energy because you never know when you'll need to act, all from my childhood home. In a pandemic like this it actually works to our benefit. Our trauma responses aren't bad, they're adaptive, and yes maladaptive when normal life mismatches the environment we grew up in, but actually positive when it does match.

My classes have been changed to online at university, and a lot of things are changing, and everyone's lives are being uprooted and that made me realize something: consistent hard work is most beneficial in a stable environment. It involves trusting circumstances, people, society, and the world. The less you trust your environment, the more unstable it is, the less likely it is that hard work will matter or make a difference. I realized that all my supposed ""laziness"" is actually a trauma response, because why would I waste my energy when my animal brain keeps telling me that something catastrophic is about to happen that will render all of it useless."
PCOS,fliaul3,t3_foto0d,1585178715.0,"That's so cool! I've actually had that thought before, like I know I have extra testosterone and I kind of enjoy it. I kind of don't want to give it up.

Like I will take weirdly shaped boobs and extra body hair if it means having that edge."
CPTSD,flec4u0,t3_fo37jx,1585081534.0,"That is such an insensitive thing to say... they're basically saying, ""Damn, but you're okay right now!"" which is minimizing the impact of the trauma on you. It's like just because I can function with it doesn't mean this isn't a struggle for me everyday. They have no IDEA the shit that me or you go through mentally. That is so callous. I recently watched a girl with autism talking about the idea of high functioning and low functioning people on the spectrum, and she said that it's not really a thing and it's kind of offensive, because all high functioning means is, ""Oh, but your autism doesn't impact ME that much."" She talked about how exhausting it is being ""high functioning"" because yes she can do normal things, but she never feels like herself, and doesn't even know who she actually is. I felt a very strong solidarity with her when she was talking about that, and I think it's because I have the same experience. I am able to function, but not in a healthy or good way. It feels false, like a mask I put on everyday. And someone who says something like that is essentially congratulating you for your ability to act like you're okay, which is at best very very unaware.

For me personally, I have so much trouble actually knowing who I am in any respect. For years I've tried to act as how I ""would"" be, who I wish I was essentially. That isn't ever how I feel though. But how I feel is so closely tied to my knee jerk reactions that I developed growing up, this anger and need for control that is always within me, that I know nobody around me deserves. So most of my life I've lived faking a smile and a positive attitude when deep down I have thoughts and feelings that most people would be shocked to know. I get angry over silly things, like when a cashier calls me ""sweetie."" I've been seen as a ""Good Girl"" for most of my life and I fucking hate it. I always think, if only you actually knew what I've been through and how much I've fought back, you wouldn't be fucking calling me ""sweetheart"" right now. It feels so weak to me. I'm kind of in the closet about my trauma I guess you could say, really no one outside my immediate family really knows the depths of what I've been through, and maybe not even some of my immediate family. (I'm the oldest and therefore got the brunt of the abuse, also I am a highly sensitive person so I believe it's affected me to a deeper degree than my siblings at times.) I think part of the reason I hold onto it so closely is that I know that no one can really understand what I've been through, and I'm not going to subject myself to other people's opinions, people who don't get it, who are gonna say shit like that. That sucks that people say that to you :( they don't understand."

AskReddit,fkn30ei,t3_fjenok,1584351126.0,"it depends. if the landlord has several properties that are doing well, or if this is their “side gig,” or if they owned a big apartment complex, then being lenient could be feasible for them. if they are depending on that income, i don’t see why their own swimming/sinking would be of less importance than the tenants. i feel people tend to forget that landlords/entrepreneurs/business owners are living off of the money they get from their ventures. it’s not just being nice or even lenient, it’s being willing to put the tenants well being above their own, which is a very kind thing to do if it is possible, but if it is not, there is no reason they should be compelled to.

(it’s also worth it to keep in mind that even if you do own several properties, you should probably be fair across the board, so if you are being lenient for one tenant you should be lenient for all of them, which obviously is just as difficult for you as if you had one tenant that wasn’t paying their rent.)"

1.) reading the master doc on r/comphet (helps you understand your sexuality in relationship to a patriarchy that expects and demands your attraction to men) 

2.) reading feminist stuff, radical and unapologetic feminist stuff. i believe there is a list somewhere of [readings associated with this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/Radical_Feminists/wiki/index), and right now i am working on “intercourse” by andrea dworkin which suggests that men’s power over women stems from their sexual acts with them 

3.) reading about and experiencing strong women that are not held back by their sex. this is much easier said than done, as most of us feel devalued or boxed in by our sex in some way. it’s really sad to see and extremely frustrating, but watching women who don’t care about those norms is everything. a lot of women want to fight the patriarchy but still subliminally believe they are worse. imo you have to find women who fight against it, yes by speaking out, but also through their actions and beliefs. this is primarily why i subscribe to gender critical feminism, because i find most other brands of feminism to be catering to another group in the name of feminism. it’s interesting to read examples of fearless women in older literature, because they just worked with what they had, it’s very inspiring. elizabeth bennet from pride and prejudice (which might be the only love story i can handle besides shrek) and jo march from little women are some really good examples. you get to see how, although they are forced to fit into the culture they live in, they are truly feminist at heart because they act like humans with hopes and dreams and hearts :)

experiencing these things makes me more proud and empowered to be a woman, and feel less like i’m losing at life because i have a female body."

infj,fjjakor,t1_fjgnvaj,1583388346.0,"heyo, ENFP mbti nerd here.

for me having inferior Si means I am usually pretty unaware of my body and have to consciously remember that my body has needs like eating and sleeping. I am also reaaaally bad at time management and recognizing that time is moving forward. sometimes I get in this mode (presumably in the grip) where I need to retreat and only focus on things that are familiar. it usually happens when I'm emotionally overwhelmed or have been putting too much pressure on myself, I sink back into this hole where all I want is something familiar and comforting, in the forms of food, TV shows, childhood movies, scents, blankets or pillows, etc.

when I take care of my Si (I have this mini theory that while the other functions ""take care of you,"" you have to take care of your inferior function and once you learn to consciously and regularly do that, you will be on your way to having a healthy personality type) I don't have these outbursts and I feel supported enough to be myself without interruption. I've also heard that the inferior is your ""aspiration"" aka the function that you are always striving towards but never really master, and I think that is my relationship to Si. I want to be able to be kind towards my body, keep a schedule, etc, but it always feels just out of reach and feels like I have to work hard to do it.

Inferior Si feels like not thinking about the past 95% of the time, and then randomly having a nostalgic memory and wanting to cry from the nostalgia. it feels like not checking the time all morning and then being like ""F IM LATE AGAIN"" every single day. it feels like forgetting to eat and throwing aside sleep and working out and then feeling like a bad person for being super annoyed at everyone and recognizing that you can't just opt out of taking care of your body. (even as I type this I'm like, am I sure about that?) it feels like randomly realizing I'm kinda allergic to soy and still eating tofu bc its only a few hives. I mean I am probably one of the ENFPs with my act less together, but I think this is the general trend for inferior Si.

Se demon for ENFPs I've heard described (from [this post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/a237zl/i_attempted_to_break_down_the_shadow_functions/)) as a last resort, as a kind of drastic need to be heard and verify that you exist and are important, objectively, and this I would say has pretty much been my experience with it. the times I've felt most tapped into my objective surroundings is when I am most angry. I think the only other times that I tap into it are when there is a moment where my mind has nothing to say about something, like when I'm watching a sunset or something. (both of these are rare occurrences)

It's funny because I was newer to mbti I used to wonder how anyone could be present without using Se, and felt I was pretty present and must use it a lot. Not so. I've realized since then how little I truly use Se, and its because every once in a while, just whenever it randomly pops into my head, I will very consciously try to tap into Se, and be fully present, without adding my own interpretation, without connecting the dots, just seeing the dots fully as they are and thats it, and I'm always like WOAH for a couple seconds. it is so foreign to me, I truly live within Ne.

counter question, what is having inferior Se like? I am curious as f about that. also I want to know about having dominant Ni but every time I ask, Ni doms just say they don't really register it at all and its kind of just working in the background which I find insane, because everyone kind of LIVeS in their dominant right? Like I recognize how much I live in Ne, because I realize I spent most of my waking hours connecting the dots. And I have talked to my INFP little sister about living in Fi and recognize how clear it is that she lives in Fi. Or Ti doms or Te doms or Fe doms or the sensing doms. but for Ni doms I just do not understand. How can you LIVE in an unconscious process? What does it feel like? what are the vibes? LOL. etc."

ENFP,fjhmk0h,t3_fdb9ff,1583351015.0,"wow, I relate to this so much, except that I usually don't get to the point of fully blunt/critical and end up becoming super emotionally drained and annoyed with that person, even to the point of distancing myself. I totally get what you mean about being bothered with people not taking your advice and coming to you with the same problem, its honestly annoying, its like if you aren't going to take my advice, at least stop complaining to me about the problem you refuse to fix.

dude I GET what you mean about INFPs. I am close to a lot of INFPs and they can be so sensitive, I really have to watch myself around them. it definitely reaches a point where I'm like, okay I feel like I can't even reason with you, and I often feel like that around Fe doms too.

interestingly I find that INTJs (maybe I have only met unhealthy ones tho) that I know tend to actually be very sensitive because of their tertiary Fi. (they are good at not living there but you could inadvertently hurt them. I feel the same way when talking to other ENFPs... like I know you can be objective but I feel like I might accidentally hurt your feelings.) INFJs are probably an equally good bet for speaking bluntly as INTJs. the other thing is that the Ni/Ne dom relationships make it so that you are able to intuit really well with the other person which allows both people to be pretty objective in my experience.

you would probably also get along well with any other NT, I find xNTPs to be really fun to talk with because neither have Fi and they really live in the objective.

for me personally, I like talking with T types because I am able to be in that objective space, but I also find it tiring after awhile because I do hit a point where I want emotional support or to be able to talk about something without judgment. you may just crave time around T types now because you have been spending so much time with F's. I think it is kinda the curse of the ENFP, to feel extroverted around introverts, introverted around extroverts, like a thinker around feelers and like a feeler around thinkers. (btw, thats another reason we get along really well with INFJs) maybe you think you're craving the T but you're really just craving the balance (?)

its worth it to consider that your friends may just be talking to you for emotional support and friendship, and not for advice. you don't have to solve their problems for them, and you shouldn't feel obligated to. I think this must be an ENFP thing, feeling like you have to take care of everyone else or be responsible for everyone else. it is definitely an ENFP thing to want everyone to be happy and to be anxious when people are unhappy, but I think that is part of our growth to learn how to not do that. in the same way, if you are hitting your emotional threshold with people, give yourself permission to not solve problems and not try to take care of them. you never have to take on other peoples problems OR other peoples emotions. its okay to listen, hear them, and let it go. its all you really can do. just like its not up to you to fix their problems, its not up to them to take your advice. if you feel you're hitting the end of your rope with something, its possible to say, listen I can't talk about this with you anymore, without blowing up. ""listen, you know my opinion on this, it hasn't changed."" should be enough to give them the hint."

EnneagramType4,fjbhpz8,t3_fcl4ly,1583193531.0,"hey welcome! so those are called instinctual variants, and it changes how your type appears and expresses itself. for in depth information I definitely recommend checking out Beatrice chestnuts ""the complete enneagram"" which you can download for free on [library genesis](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=3818B54AB1A845FADAC1883BD1968D50). also [this test](https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test-2) might be able to help you determine your variant.

basically, the way I think about it is, if your number on the enneagram is the specific strategy you or your ego uses as a defense mechanism, your instinctual variant delineates what area you focus that strategy in. its important to know because since different instincts can appear different, you may mistype your number if you do not take instinct into account. also, once you know your instinct, you can receive much more personal/accurate advice than if you are just looking at advice for your number.

&#x200B;

**sp = Self preservation.**

this means your focus is on survival as an individual. SP types tend to be more reserved, straightforward, and hardworking than other types, in general. self prez 4's are said to be the ""countertype"" because the characteristics of a self preservation type make them seem less ""4-like.""

**so= Social.**

these types focus on survival by being a part of a group. SO types are usually the most outgoing or social. specifically social 4's are known as the ""sad 4"" because they are the 4's that wear their hearts on their sleeve and are often sharing their emotions. probably the most prototypical example of a 4 -- usually when you hear descriptions of 4's, the description most closely matches a social 4.

**sx= Sexual.**

also called the ""one-to-one"" instinct, this instinctual variant focuses on survival through intimate relationships (not necessarily romantic but that is often the focus of these types). SX types are often the most intense, and can even come off as ""aggressive."" sexual 4's are known as the ""mad 4"" and have been said to appear like 8's because of how angry they can be. these 4's bottle up their emotions and may outburst at random times. they are good at making themselves ""special"" and good at creating magnetic and intense connections with others.

&#x200B;

if you think about it evolutionarily, each instinct is really a different type of valuable strategy to survive -- focus on taking care of yourself, focus on being part of the pack, or focus on close bonding with other individuals. you also have a dominant and a secondary instinct, and your third one is usually your ""blind spot"" so to speak."

I am such a different person than I was 2 years ago, but because I've worked so hard to get here. It's so insanely worth it, I feel like I'm just beginning to start living my life. it seems so obvious that all of it was from my trauma, but it is so hard to see that in the moment when you don't know anything else."

not to attack you or anything but I think that level of confidence in human ability is inaccurate and problematic"

best thing - i feel like i can see the raw potential in every person, and i want to see everyone get there. i have a very strong understanding of what being authentic looks like, and (speaking as a sexual subtype) i believe i also have this really big well of creative energy to tap into. i’m able to create these really fun magnetic emotionally intense connections with people. i definitely know how to bring the realness out in people and have fun. i think i’m skilled at bringing people out of their shells, especially more reserved personalities. i have this ability to know when there’s more to someone. (all of this at the risk of sounding braggy..)

worst thing - i think knowing how good it could be paralyzes me when it’s not at that place. i identify so strongly with my emotions to the point that i literally cannot function when im upset. it’s cost me a lot in terms of practicality and productivity. im very bad at taking responsibility when i’m not feeling my best, and i always feel like things need to be perfect before i can move forward. i also sometimes find myself regretting the intensity i bring to interactions and feeling that it doesn’t truly represent how i feel. i find it difficult to reconcile being genuine and being “on.”"

EnneagramType4,file4dg,t3_f8he9a,1582499532.0,"The books that have helped me the most:

* You Can Heal Your Life by Louise Hay, basically a book that walks you through loving yourself and embracing life. So essential for getting rid of that constant feeling that ""something is wrong"" that 4's seem to have. Louise Hay also has a ton of really good wake up/sleep meditations on youtube that I've listened to a lot over the past couple years.
* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck by Mark Manson, I appreciate this book a lot because it cuts through all the bullshit that we tell ourselves. Mark Manson is an excellent self improvement writer, and his brand of self improvement is so different than most. It's not about feeling good or being optimistic, it's about being straight with yourself and genuinely taking a look at what you value so that you can get the most out of your one life. I think this is significant for 4's because we have a tendency to fall back into our emotions and forget that things change when we make them change, not just when we are done feeling sad.
* The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle, this one I recommend reading after the Louise Hay book, as it is kind of a more ""advanced"" life advice book in my opinion. Eckhart Tolle essentially walks you through the fact that the present is all that exists for you, now and forever. This book was so difficult for me to get through and internalize the messages, but it's so worth it. I think it's important for 4's because we struggle a lot with being present in our own bodies, and this book is the perfect antidote.
* The Complete Enneagram by Beatrice Chestnut, esp the section about 4's of course, this book looks directly at the problematic mindsets and behaviors that are taken on by your type and the right mindsets and actions to counter them.

I wanted to mention that you might feel super defensive reading them, I definitely did reading each one of these, but that's how you know it's actually challenging your worldview. What helps for me is to remind myself that I never have to take on other beliefs as my own, and that I am only exploring how other people see life. Hope they help!"

CPTSD,fil1k6i,t3_f8bbk1,1582491680.0,"yes yes i feel this, no you are *not* crazy.

i think i am figuring all of this out finally after feeling like this for so long and i think it comes from this:

your kindness is a survival mechanism. you are used to being kind and good not because you want to but because you’ve been taught it’s the only way unless you want something bad to happen to you. therefore your kindness is conditional, not unconditional. that’s why it feels fake. at the same time it also feels like you have no other option.

one of the ways i am able to be more myself through it all is to say “i am safe” over and over. reminding myself that i don’t have to fight to survive. my actions have felt more and more unconditional and from a place of wanting to do something instead of needing to do it."
ENFP,fil0d9s,t1_fikr6et,1582490948.0,"im glad you appreciated my thoughts on it!

yes idk if you could tell from my post but i have a real soft spot for the INFJ/ENFP pairing :) i wrote this post on the magic of that pairing a few months ago if you wanted to check it out:
https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/dic5zn/how_it_feels_as_an_enfp_to_find_an_infj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

i truly need to meet more INFJs in real life, the few i have met ive clicked with so quickly, it’s magical. there is just this magical mutual understanding that i’ve really never gotten with anyone else, even an INTJ. 

ExxPs do have trouble finding the off switch but i think ENFPs are the most likely to find their chill and need alone time as well, although i have definitely met ENFPs that are like *go go go*, personally i definitely need time to myself, and also another thing that ENFPs tend to enjoy a lot is being near you, but not talking just doing our own thing quietly, i know i definitely appreciate that kind of time together. another thing worth mentioning is that healthy ENFPs tend to be highly independent, so we may let you have your alone time and go off to hang out with our other friends. most ENFPs don’t want a relationship to tie them down, so if you need alone time we are more than happy to do our own thing and come back when you’re recharged :)

as for the sensitive thing, that is definitely real, but if you are an INFJ (i think you are?) i know it’s a stereotype but i doubt you would really have trouble with it? personally i find INFPs to be the more sensitive ones while ENFPs are generally good at understanding where you are coming from and putting themselves in others shoes. i know for me personally it’s almost like i have two modes, one where we can be theoretical and discuss implications of things and abstractions and i will separate it from my personal feelings (for the most part), and the other where it IS personal and emotional. this is one of the things i adore about INFJs as they seem like one of the only personality types that are able to dynamically move between the two in that respect like myself. (INFPs, ENFJs, and most other feelers take most things personally, whereas T users often lose tact when they get in that thinking mode)

hope you meet a female ENFP in real life :) if not i’ll be your friend"

Empaths,fij5oz8,t3_f81v49,1582435321.0,"I say don't listen to a non-empath about whether you are an empath. It's funny because that is a very empath thing to do, to check with other people for the truth, but you have to trust yourself. I believe people who haven't experienced what its like to be an empath truly do not understand how it feels. in the past I've compared it to trying to understand colors that you don't experience. its very difficult to describe exactly how you know these things and feel these things to someone who does not know and feel them. I have spent a lot of time trying to explain myself to family members and friends and typically at the best think I'm kinda crazy and at the worst think I'm almost arrogant. its also an interesting dynamic in that while we have this extra sense about people, it can blind us to what most people are pretty competent at, things like judging whether or not you want to be someones friend or if someone has bad intentions, because we see the intention and understand them.

Secondly, to me, it sounds like you are an empath, but I think only you can really figure this out. Also its worth mentioning if you know you have these gifts, use them. The label is not necessarily important. I don't even really think about myself as an empath, it often feels too ""out there"" for me. The only thing I really know is my experience. The label empath is only really important for being able to connect with other people with a similar experience of the world, and for finding resources to understand how to use our abilities. The advice that I have come across for empaths has been extremely helpful to me, so that is what I go off of. Sometimes I question whether or not I'm an empath, but then I think, it doesn't really matter, because these videos are helping me and speaking to me either way, so I am gonna keep watching them. (The videos I watch are from Amanda Flaker, if you wanna check her out. She has some really groundbreaking stuff.)

TrueOffMyChest,fihh5vo,t1_fihezy0,1582410344.0,"dude i am female. i read mark manson’s book out of curiosity and it is really good. it is not a classic pickup artist book. the subtitle is “attracting women through authenticity.” (granted idk why he named it models..) it basically teaches you how to be confident as yourself and find yourself attractive enough to actually be attractive to women, but it’s genuinely deeper than that. he basically advocates for building the type of life you want to live, so that the women that you would want to be with would want to be with you. it is geared towards men, but i got a lot out of it as a female. mark manson if you didn’t know is the author of “the subtle art of not giving a fuck” and has an amazing blog, and the relationship section is all about being yourself and having healthy boundaries. the main reason i mention it here is that he emphasizes many times over in the book that women are more attracted to authenticity than anything else which is something i genuinely agree with. sooo don’t knock it till you try it!"

PurplePillDebate,fh8nza6,t3_f1rc7t,1581363772.0,"The cornerstone of both, it seems to me, is a demonization of the sexual drive. I suppose at one point in history this could have been useful, (IE maybe when birth control wasn't a thing) but I don't think it is any longer. When one is seen as good (madonna/provider) and one is seen as bad (whore/dominator) we have to separate those roles within our mind, splitting our psyche down the middle.

I think these opposing roles can be rectified by deciding to no longer fulfill roles, and we do that by deciding that sexual desire is not bad. Yes, you need self control around it, just like any desire, but sexual desire is a part of our beings, just like desire for food or human interaction. When we believe it is bad, it forces us to compartmentalize. *Normally I'm good, but sometimes I'm 'bad,' and the 'bad' can't mix with the good.* 

 As soon as we accept that we can be a fully integrated human being, we lose identification with those roles. You are not a provider. You are not a Madonna. You are not a dominator. You are not a whore. You are a person that can do anything you please. And I think it's terrifying to let go of roles. They give us a kind of security. But its also fucking liberating. And then all you have to do is find someone else who doesn't identify with roles either."
