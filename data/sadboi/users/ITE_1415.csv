So I'm stuck on the face up part : On one hand, I love fairyland's face up, but the Ria face up don't seem to be as playful as I want her to be. On the other, I think some face up artist could achieve the look I want... but I'm fairly new to the hobby and am afraid to dabble in the shipping, waiting more, stressing and stuff.

If you have any advice to give to a newbie like me, I'd be very grateful !

* Chicken nugget (yup, really)
* Black woman

* self-diagnosed dissociative identity disorder
   * (REALLY hurts the DID community, as a lot of misinformation is spread by this woman (like DID is bad or the people who have it are dangerous), and hurts a lot of systems, flash-backs and other alters)

Plus : She is bullying a system, who has DID, and mocking it. They were very responsible and respecting of her.

after drinking you.

You, you, you.

I love you.

You are my flower.

""But, what is this show

For a heart that disappeared ?""

For it is how my heart is for now.

Instead of mine, the Void stands,

Alone and unknown.""

Without a cry, without a scream.
