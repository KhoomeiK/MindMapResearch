For the last 7 years I worked for a small firm. An older man completely out of touch with reality ran the firm. He inherited a ton of money, but acted like it was all self made since he turned it into a law firm. Once a year, every year, he would take each employee out to lunch individually and give a private speech about how the most important thing we could ever do in our lives was max out our 401k. Now, in theory, I get this advice. But it doesn’t really work when you get paid peanuts for the profession you’re in. With my student loans, I was living paycheck to paycheck with minimal contributions. He had no concept of understanding that or understanding the cost of living. 

Now, here’s the part that gets me every time. Every. Single. Year. He would tell us to max it out with the same movie quote. From the Boiler Room he’d ALWAYS quote “they say money can’t buy happiness...but look at the smile on my face, grinning ear to ear baby!” He would launch into a story about how he self made himself a millionaire and how he bought himself happiness. 

Two years ago, his wife had a massive stroke. She’s alive, but barely. He has no friends, no hobbies, no functional wife, his kids hate him, and a failing firm. I have never met someone so miserable in my entire life. He has all the money in the world. And bragged about it. But when it came down to it, money did not buy him happiness."
