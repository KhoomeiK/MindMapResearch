AskReddit,fldmf2z,t3_fnwkzt,1585067450.0,Im an EMT who has been off for two weeks due to an exposure to Covid. I was putting off a haircut before it happened. All of the shops are closed and my mother used to be a hair stylish. I’m not allowed to head over because my pops has an exposed immune system. I guess I’ll roll in next week looking like a beat nick because what else am I suppose to do besides shave it all off?
NewToEMS,fkscw1u,t3_fkepft,1584487257.0,"Ask questions. Observe on your first day. If you feel like you're ready hop in where there's a gap. Follow your EMT/PM's lead. WEAR GLOVES! You will run into some nasty shit out there and don't want to bring it home to BF/GF/kids/grandma or whoever. Take vitals, dont bullshit blood pressure readings. AGAIN ASK QUESTIONS. Textbook vs IRL is a complete different world. Treat the patient and not the machine. Don't take what dispatch has to say for granted. They'll state SOA and chest pain when it's the regular homeless dude who just wants a ride. Treat every call serious until your primary assessment. If they're breathing, no need to panic! A few days after ride time, feel free to take lead on non critical runs. Good luck and breathe! You'll do great. Oh and don't be like me, wear a damn if your PT is coughing."

You’ll be alright."

I'm currently on 10th ride along and everyday I feel dumb as shit with the questions my PM will ask me. With exposure and time, you will get there! They are your FTO for a reason and are there to train you. In time you'll get other preceptors who will understand. With my short time in my agency, I know alot of people talk mad shit, but then again there is everywhere. Brush it off, study up some more, have a beer and relax. You got this!"

Luckily no one was injured and thankfully I had a dash cam which saved my ass! I've been saving up for the past year for a newer car. Last Saturday I paid half in Cash and financed the rest to build my credit score.   I originally looked at a 2016 Civic coupe 6MT, but the dealer sold it the day prior.
