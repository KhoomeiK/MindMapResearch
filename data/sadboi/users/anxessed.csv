familyguy,fmgp2in,t3_fv1dir,1586054134.0,"Every night I fall asleep to either old episodes of Family Guy, Futurama, or King of the Hill and I've done this since they all aired adult swim. I remember in 2012 I was falling asleep next to my girlfriend at the time and awoke to her laughing her ass off at James Bottomtooth singing ""Amazing Grace"" after Brian tried to get him to sign his petition to overturn Mayor West's gay marriage ban. I miss her and that time of my life but all good things come to an end I suppose."
