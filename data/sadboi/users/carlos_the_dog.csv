mentalhealth,ffnsacq,t1_ffnmy34,1580070103.0,Sorry..dont want to be rude..tbh i have been going through some rough shit myself and have alot of problem opening up. Even the thought of going to a therapist and sitting in front if someone and talking about my deepest emotions makes my heart race and anxiety goes through the roof. I apologized before as i wanted to ask whether it was the caffeine high or the brink of death that made you decide/realize it was high time to open up?

Ofcourse i can go to an expensive place and have authentic Michelin star chinese. But that's not what i am looking for as a bachelor. A local restaurant that serves good chinese/indo-chinese is just fine. Pls dont misunderstand my tone. Take it as a fun challenge man. Like challenging someone to find ditto in Pokemon Go :p. Infact read the first comment where the guy didn't even answer my question and was even more toxic.
