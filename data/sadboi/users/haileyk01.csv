Vent,etm9v6i,t3_cccg7i,1562955213.0,"I know what you’re saying and it sucks honestly because if you ask to be validated then it seems like you aren’t confident with yourself (whether you are or aren’t) and guys hate that and see it as a turn off. It also gets annoying to ask and means even less if you had to ask for it rather than them saying it on their own because you know they mean it. Sometimes I post selfies on my Instagram/Snapchat honestly for the sole purpose of hearing something from my boyfriend and sometimes he says stuff, sometimes he doesn’t and he used to get upset a lot thinking that I do it for the attention of others. I mean sure I do like hearing it from others if he doesn’t acknowledge it, but I much rather/only rather hear it from him. There’s only so much you can say though, and honestly it’s just something I’ve had to accept because if he’s not the type of person to compliment/say frequently how he thinks I’m pretty I have to find other means to bring up my self esteem."

Vent,etjbfri,t3_cbxfan,1562870095.0,"My mom always told me that when I was younger and even now, so I’m always extremely anxious about being with guys and in relationships in general. It has implanted in my mind more or less every single guy only objectifies women and it makes it hard to believe whatever “heartfelt” things they will tell you. It’s honestly a really toxic thing to believe but it’s extremely hard to shake off your mind as well"

I was just talking to the therapist how I felt and about my anxiety and the chest pains and she was the one at the end that recommended it to me, so I didn’t even have to ask for it. You might not even have to be the one to bring it up with you be honest and tell the therapist about what’s happening"

aves,esthzd5,t3_c8y9g4,1562267700.0,I feel like in most cases people record you if they really like your dancing and if you give them a good vibe. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a video online that’s bashing someone for how they dance and if that were the case I’m sure others would try to shut it down because music festivals are supposed to be a place where you can let go and feel accepted

Anxiety,eraxqmu,t3_c126xx,1560655541.0,"I do this literally ALL THE TIME and I definitely feel like for me it was because my ex. I was with him for about a year and a half and due to his obsessive and toxic behaviors he always made sure I HAD to talk to him 24/7 and he would always push everything aside to text me to make sure he knew what I was doing. I got accustomed to the constant talking, and once I started dating my current boyfriend it seemed like he was ignoring me if he didn’t talk for a few hours, although this is normal in healthy relationships. I have gotten a lot better now, even if he reads it and doesn’t answer right away. You just have to push yourself to try to focus on what you’re doing and not him, and he will get back to you once he’s available. It’s a constant battle but I promise it’ll get better :)"

Honestly, all I can recommend is possibly shutting off your phone if that’s a distraction until you’re done with your assignments because at least for me that made my anxiety worse. Maybe even going to an area you feel comfortable by yourself and can realize and focus on your work. I usually would go to the library and go to a floor that nobody usually went to/was quiet so I could try to relax. You have to just push through because although your anxiety is in the present, it’s definitely not worth letting it affect your studies"
