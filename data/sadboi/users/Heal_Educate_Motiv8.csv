depression,eqhe3hq,t3_bycijd,1560056087.0,"There is a natural intelligence with all children. Hate to say this to all those who are pro schooling.   
Education is awesome, but in what mean?   


School does not nurture you, it does not take your temperance and teach you according to your speed.   
It seems that schools Psychologically grind up those who are not academic enough and spits them out.  


What happens after that?   


Wounded students.  


I would have cases where I am in work, and had something explained to me.. I would blank out.   
Now that i look back on it, I had mind cloud. It is a state of mind where everything is hazy.   


No one is stupid, unless you compare them to all those leading scientists etc... And why would you do that to yourself. Why berate yourself?Your not anyone else but yourself. Don't compare your self with other people, they are not you.  


Remember,  everyone has their natural talent, even if they don't know it yet.

I recommend to take up the Kolbe Index.

It will explain where your natural intelligence is, and a list of recommendations.   


Don't psychologically, hurt yourself. The pain of it is not worth it. Your better then that.  
You will find your way. In life, wisdom comes through experience, and through experience, you can make better choices.

Love is the most powerful energy in all of existence.

It is love we all crave, It is love we all can give.

It is love we share with others, which makes them feel safe.

It is love to be love, and allowing one to feel and give love.

You have the freedom to chose Joy over misery. 

&#x200B;

Harness your strength in the choices of NOW, this empowers you.

What if, just what if, you mustered the same attitude towards greatness, than misery?

Would you surprise yourself?

&#x200B;

It is in fear you know so well, you are use to it, like old furniture. You cling on to it, with the fear of the unknown.

Although you feel that your held back by your negative emotions, it is in truth that your most loving experiences are out there, ready to be created just for you. It is all about the right attitude."

Hey Shy Pear Dot.

&#x200B;

You have my compassion, regarding to the pain your endured so far. I had my fair share of mental misery.

&#x200B;

I have been seeing different psychiatrists over the years, their main speciality is diagnosing and medicating.

&#x200B;

We believe it is a psychologist who sits patiently and listens and gives you advice.

I guess I know the awkwardness of seeking help, It is pretty much getting that phone and say, ""Hi, my name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and i would like to make an appointment with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."" Easy.
