(!Caution: Long Text!

This is the backstory for the project these characters are a part of:
They’re characters I developed for a video game I am working on that I’m planning to opensource as soon as the basic structure is 100% clear and not just 99% so people have something to work with. Basically I’m going to open the project up for anyone who wants to work on it
The idea for the game itself came from when I was in a really bad place and developed my own strategy to deal with that - I made up a character that I would use as a fictional representation to try out things I was going to do irl like for example when anxiety keept bothering me he represented anxiety and i tried ignoring, getting along, fighting etc on that fictional level
This developed into a huge thing over time since I did some worldbuilding and made a bunch more characters.
Now I want to make this into a game and I’d love it to be an open project because it’s still all about sharing that tactic and I believe if people are supposed to be able to get anything out of the game maybe I should give them a way to contribute. As soon as it’s at a point where I can market it, I’ll start setting up something so people can donate to the project which I will split amongst the main contributors to motivate them to work on)"

https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/31zt8r/how_to_really_really_avoid_fingerprinting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Also I saw something about you asking if just viewing the video contributes to their business and there was an answer along the lines of „yes, they can use that for stats like in (month) X% of users were from (country)“
That too would not happen if you use tor, since they will only have the IP Adress of the Exit node ***






*** „qUiCk“ introduction to how Tor works:

When you access the Tor browser it connects you to a node network.

What does that mean?

So if you go to websiteofyourchoice.com it sends that request through a chain of computers (called nodes) before the last one in the chain sends it to the server that hosts websiteofyourchoice.com. Now I know so far you‘re probably like „What? Why would I send my data to other computers first, isn‘t that like sharing my data with everyone?“ but here‘s the catch: It‘s encrypted - with multiple layers of encryption.

So unencrypted traffic (anything on your normal Browser that doesn’t start with https:// [the s is very important, it means secure, just http:// isn’t the same] at the beginning) would be like a Postcard - you and the recipient can see everything just looking at it, but so can the post office and any malicious actor who‘s spying on you.

Encrypted traffic would be more like a letter in an envelope, obfuscated from view.

In this Metaphor, when you send a request (example 1: open video) to a website (example 1: pornhub) you write that request on that letter and put it in an envelope, then put that envelope in another envelope etc. But the envelopes can only be opened if you have a key for each envelope.
Now while it passes through every node can only remove one envelope (layer of encryption) and then passes it on to the next node

Which node comes next is also encrypted and each node only knows the node where it came from and the node to which it’s supposed to send it next, but that’s it.


Here it is a bit more visual:

You  -> „guard“ node  -> „relay“ node 1  -> „relay“ node 2  -> ... -> „relay“ node X -> „exit“ node  -> public server (the website)


Thing is: Each node will „think“ the traffic originated from the previous node (refence to example 1: relay node 2 thinks relay node 1 sent the request to connect to relay node 3, but doesn’t know you actually want to connect to pornhub.com and watch a video). relay node 2 only knows relay node 1 and 3, none before or after.

The only node that knows what kind of request (“open video”) was sent and to whom (pornhub.com) is the exit node.
Because the exit node (like all nodes) only knows one node before and after itself it thinks that relay node X sent the request. It doesn’t know about you.

This means to website server your IP is not visible, only the exit node’s IP, which can be located anywhere on the world. Because of this the website thinks you’re in Spain if your exit node is in Spain

PS: You can reset your node “path” at any time and with every new browser session it gets reset automatically.
Tor also automatically deletes Cookies when you close the browser. If you don’t want to get tracked, frequently reset your Tor session (there’s a little broom icon that basically closes and reopens tor). You may want to copy the link of the website you were on before though as it clears that as well.


pros and cons of tor:

+Extremely hard to track you down (not impossible but there’s few things that come close)
+There js Javascript protection for XSS/malicious code (makes it harder to hack you)
+it’s free

-It’s slower than your normal browser
-scripts that can run are limited (due to Javascript protection)
-some websites may be blocked (for example streaming websites like amazon prime or netflix) or require you to fill out captchas more frequently than usual


Sorry for the very long comment, hope it helps though. If anything is not super comprehensible, please feel free to ask. I could always have made a mistake in grammar or vocabulary as I’m not a native speaker.

*addition:

Honestly, why does it impact people enough for them to spend time and energy into being a disrespectful, and I cannot stress this enough, prick?
These people haven’t hurt you, infringed on your freedom or disrespected you by just existing.
Now, ofc if you accidentally use a wrong pronoun and correct yourself, it happens, but going out of your way to upset someone? That’s not cool.

Here’s an example of how I handle this stuff (not saying I’m perfect but I think it may be a good start)
Basically if someone tells me they’re trans and it’s a variation I am not very familiar with, I would ask them what pronouns they would like me to use and use those, no matter how I feel about that. I mean I’m using it to reference them not me in convos.
Changing one word in how I speak about someone can change the situation from making them feel uncomfortable and possibly hating themself to having a respectful conversation on both ends.

Now what I do understand is risky is that the government would enforce their ideals like that, because if it’s allowed now, then once there’s a different constellation of parties in power, that may be straight up nazis or repressing the freedom or their citizens to have more control, these tools may be used once again but with worse intentions (Depending on how exactly the law looks and I’m not familiar enough with uk law to guarantee I am 100% right)

Edit: quoting u/captn_gillet here „It sets a precedent for further infringement upon freedom of speech.“



** addition2: 

It’s not about political beliefs in your case, it’s about saying insulting things to a very specific group of people.
There is a huge difference."

I also use it to let out any anger or sadness I may feel on a level where it can’t come back at me or rly hurt anyone, cause after all it’s all fictional

This has been going on for five years and roughly two and a half years ago I decided to turn it into a video game, now to be fair I had no idea what I was doing. I had never made a game before. I just knew it was what I wanted to do. And don’t get me wrong, I’m still in the process, still have a lot to learn before I can start like actually developing it (With other people and like the actual 3d art and programming stuff), but the concept is getting along nicely.

My goal with it is to basically give others access to this fictional world, as a sort of toolbox. I know it has helped me through a lot of shit, so I hope it can help others too.

And if it helps even just one person that will be enough

Also it‘s onteresting to note the etymology of these words:

WAGER c. 1300, wajour ""a promise, a vow, something pledged or sworn to;"" also ""a bet, a wager; stakes, something laid down as a bet,"" from Anglo-French wageure, Old North French wagiere (Old French gagiere, Modern French gageure) ""pledge, security,"" from wagier ""to pledge""

BET 1590s, ""pledge as a forfeit to another who makes a similar pledge in return,"" originally in the argot of petty criminals, a word of unknown origin; see bet (n.), which appeared about the same time. Intransitive sense of ""lay a wager"" is from c. 1600. Used since mid-19c. in various American English slang assertions (bet your life, 1848; bet your boots, 1856; you bet ""be assured,"" 1857, identified in Century Dictionary as ""originally California slang"").





Arguments against the other ones:


1. It‘s not luck, it‘s his power

2. He‘s not really gambling (Its meaning is much more tied to risking something of value at a game of luck)

3. Payout sounds like it‘s always about money (Due to the syllable „pay“ which people are contitioned to associate with money

4. Win(s) is a bit too plain for my taste st least (Like when you give a little kid a dog and they name it „dog“)"
