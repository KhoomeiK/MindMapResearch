bipolar,fg8jy8w,t3_ex7ua9,1580621865.0,I just had a few breakdowns this morning about the same damn thing. I'm so exhausted... I've quit 3 jobs in the past year because I cant handle the long days of nonstop smiling and bubblyness. Why cant I just function like a normal person... why does the only thing required of me have to be so damn hard.

relationship_advice,etkiejr,t3_cc4vcw,1562898822.0,"I had a friend that did this to me for years. If he kept doing this and didnt seek professional help, there was and is nothing you can do except tell him to talk to a therapist."
relationship_advice,etb6i66,t3_caugdu,1562638268.0,"Speaking as someone with bipolar, it can be very difficult to think clearly when you're ""up"" or when you're ""down"". You should start seeing a therapist before you jump to any quick conclusions. I've been in a successful long term relationship while having untreated bipolar, but not all people can handle that. If your boyfriend cant handle the ups and downs, dont waste either one of y'alls time. It's hard."
