The other one got off the lease (because she was moving away) but then just stayed and paid less and less rent but didn’t make any plan to actually leave.

NAH 


I was going to give a gentle y t a to you, because honestly it probably wasn’t a good idea to let your girlfriend on the call. But then again, you DID feel that you’d adequately communicated the risks, and your GF agreed. That makes it tricky. I have a grandpa with dementia and can absolutely understand the frustration and devastation of having someone you love not be who they used to be. I don’t think people who haven’t experienced it can truly understand how complex dementia is, and how quickly things can change. One minute, my grandpa is the most lovely, well spoken, educated man you’ve ever met- and the next, he’s walking around the house naked because he forgot his clothes. My uncle’s girlfriend said he was “creepy” because he walked in on them naked when they were sleeping in the guest room- but “creepy” implies there was some sort of intent there, which there absolutely isnt!! It’s similar here. You know that your grandma isn’t racist at heart, just like I know my grandpa isn’t a nudist. But people who don’t know her as well can much more easily take those behaviours to heart. 



I understand why your GF is upset. It would be awful to hear those things said to you, especially from someone close to someone you love. However, she needs a lesson in the NUMBER ONE RULE of dementia- it’s not you, it’s not even them- it’s the illness. Just as you wouldn’t hold it against someone for throwing up because they’re sick, you have to have really clear boundaries in your mind. When my grandpa calls me by his other granddaughter’s name, it stings- but I know that’s not him. Your girlfriend just doesn’t have that practice and emotional resilience built up yet- and she shouldn’t have to if she doesn’t want to. She is well within her rights to not come onto any more video calls if she chooses- and you shouldn’t take that decision as an insult towards your grandma."

Get him into therapy. 


My father HATES puke. Can’t stand it. Will puke if confronted with other person’s puke. But if he was the ONLY person in the room and someone vomited, he would handle it. (He’s actually a surgeon, and somehow has no issue with shit or blood or placenta, but still hates puke which should show you how deeply that runs.) 


I have over the last year developed a severe anxiety disorder that causes me to vomit cyclically for hours to days when triggered. I’m in therapy, have been for MONTHS, and it’s still not even close to solved. If I had had these issues in high school, I wouldn’t have been able to pass. You owe it to your son to take him to therapy and help him start working on this disorder. Otherwise he’ll be “that guy” for the rest of his life- how is he going to handle a girlfriend/wife with morning sickness? Labour?? Having a small human of his own that explodes shit all day?

She hated it by then. It annoyed her so much, and I could tell that she wished she’d put a stop to it when he was smaller. 


Disclaimer- I have no issues with co-sleeping or prolonged nursing, but I think if as a parent you want your child to be sleep trained by toddlerhood, you have to start earlier than 22 months like my old boss. (6 months is a good baseline.) It was frustrating as hell to spend every single day trying to sleep train him for naps (at HER instruction, so her nights would be easier) only for her to say every morning “he wanted to come in with me and nurse all night so I let him because he’s my only baby.” Like okay, do what you like, but don’t complain every day that your child isn’t sleep trained when you won’t do the work to get him there 🙄"

mentalhealth,fo7uvik,t3_g5xnea,1587584947.0,"I’m just offering a slightly different perspective here- it might have been an accident. Let’s try for a second to step away from the whole “parents having a 4some thing” because as traumatic as it would have been to see that, they are entitled to their own sexual life, and I’m sure they wouldn’t have wanted their children to see/know about it. The issue here isn’t what they did or who they did it with- and that should not be part of the conversation if you do confront them. 


The issue is WHAT they taped over- and from the sounds of it, they didn’t tape over your whole speech- just the end. Yes, that’s still shitty, and yes, it’s a loss, but it’s also very possible that your parents DID NOT MEAN TO. Personally, if I was about to have a 4some and film it, I might be a TINY bit too preoccupied by the 3 naked adults in my room to read the label on the DVD/VHS I’m using. 


When something like this happens, it’s easy to feel as though it’s a judgement or an attack on ourselves personally. It isn’t, though, and more often than not, it’s about THEM, not us. I would try sitting down with them and saying “mom, dad, I took out my graduation speech to watch it earlier and I think you’ve accidentally taped over it with something...personal. I just wanted you to know that I’m deeply hurt that you didn’t pay attention to which DVD you used, because now an important moment of my life is gone forever. I hope that you feel that what you were doing when you taped over it was worth it.” 


This is one of those times where you will not be taken seriously for losing your cool. Being valedictorian is a big deal (and you should be very proud!) but it’s also just the first of many accomplishments you will celebrate in your life- you will have other opportunities to shine and look back on. The best case scenario for you here is not to scream/yell/cry, but instead to say very little. The less you say, the more uncertain they will be. If you present it as being an accident, then if it WAS, they’ll tell you, and if it wasn’t, they’ll feel even worse because their child just said “it had to have been an accident because I know you wouldn’t have taped over something that means that much to me.” 


Please don’t hurt yourself. It’s not worth it- and I say that as someone who still has to fight against the urge to grab a razor every now and then. It is not worth it to mark your body for people who wouldn’t even mark their mind to remember you. It’s not worth it to hurt yourself before you have the whole story. It’s never worth it.

You need therapy. This isn’t a criticism. Everyone needs therapy sometimes. And if you go to therapy, all these overwhelming, negative feelings will slowly start to ease. It won’t magically get easy. It’s not easy for most people- but I’ve read your post history, and this doesn’t sound very easy for you either. Take it from someone who knows a lot about this field- you are not too far gone. You CAN have a different life from the one you keep envisioning. You don’t need to be angry, resentful, bitter, or in pain. But if you continue to lash out at people, proclaim that nobody has it as bad as you or can understand you, if you don’t open up and accept help...you will one day realize that you’ve spent your whole life being angry and alone, when you could have spent it happy and surrounded by people and relationships that you were emotionally healthy enough to form and maintain. 


I don’t want to be alarmist. People can change at any age. But the habits you make in your twenties are the ones you make for life, and if you don’t create a habit of therapy and emotionally healthy thinking now, it’s going to be even harder when you do try one day.

Potentially, because of the stress of the current situation, it has triggered an anxiety response in her. She’s being very controlling, she’s created strange irrational rules and is very emotionally attached to them- like someone who is suffering from a mental illness. I don’t really know much else to add except that maybe you should google OCD and the ways it manifests and see if your GF fits any of the parameters."

Men like you genuinely scare me. Not because you’re a bad person, per se, but because you’re so GODDAMN SELF INVOLVED that you didn’t stop for one SECOND to think about how your actions might affect her. Do you have any idea how difficult sex workers have it in this political climate? How many hoops we have to jump through to keep our finances above board, to keep our identities secret, to keep ourselves safe? You outed her, and now you get to go about your life with a little dose of Reddit validation while she is left picking up the pieces. 


You’d better fucking subscribe and pay her 15$/month as an apology at the very least. Ugh.

He had been responding because he thought they were both discussing me, and then he started feeling vibes. I don’t necessarily hold ill will about it now- I know how she is, she’s been described as “that girl comes on to the whole room,” and her personality is flirty. However, at the time, added to her comment about not wanting to stay friends, I felt as though she had been speaking behind my back to everyone, and flirting with my boyfriend as well, so I blew up.

When I was a kid my family went and stayed in someone else’s house to house sit for them. One of the kids who lived there had collected hundreds of beanie babies and left the tags on- suffice to say, my brothers and I were too young to understand why anyone would leave the tags on their toys, and many toys were untagged.

Nanny,fkks16o,t3_fj1hx2,1584290733.0,"I never stressed too much about naps when I was a nanny. I would get the kid on a consistent schedule, try my best to tire them out, and then if they didn’t go down when I tried, I’d just give it a half hour and try again. It takes the pressure off a bit, knowing that I’ll be able to go home in a few hours even if the baby didn’t nap enough. As a parent it’s stressful when they don’t nap, because that’s time YOU could use to rest or clean or what have you, but the nanny has the luxury of being able to focus mainly on the kid."
