•Kylie Cosmetics Koko K Gloss - I had always wanted to try Kylie Cosmetics to see if it was worth the hype. I went in Ulta and swatched all the glosses, and this one stood out to me. Being a nude basic girl, this one is more pink than I would normally go for, but I love it.
•NYX Soft Lip Cream in Cannes - Gotta have a good pink/nude matte lip! I love the smell and cream consistency of this, plus it is matte and really not that drying on me. 
•L’Oréal Color Riche Shine in Glossy Fawn - I really loved the formulas of these! Super moisturizing and the color is absolutely gorgeous. It’s kind of a nude beige color with warm tones. 
•Wet n Wild Lip Liner in Bare to Comment - this nude goes with everything and I love the formula and twist up applicator! Super cheap as well, so definitely a bang for your buck."

Third, coming from a young person that struggles with depression and anxiety and a young age: If she’s not already, she absolutely needs to see a therapist. Medicine can help, yes, but she needs to go somewhere where she can learn how to manage her feelings and thoughts appropriately. Also can help for gaining tools to use in the future.

I don’t know if this helps or not, since I am a woman, but I hope so:

I first looked at porn when I was 12 years old, I’m now 23. I struggle with that addiction still, but I’m nowhere near where I was before. An addiction to pornography is very strong and very real, much like people that struggle with opioid/narcotic addiction. The longer you have had the addiction, the harder it is to get rid of it. So many people think that once you stop watching pornography cold turkey then you’re cured, but that’s not how it works. Since I’ve began my relationship with the Lord, it has given me the strength to resist most of the time. I still struggle every few months...but again, I’m nowhere near where I was years ago. I’m getting better, and mentally I’m getting to a much better place than before! 

I know that when you are together with someone that struggles with porn, you can take this very personally and start blaming yourself, but don’t. We already feel so horrible about this addiction already, so don’t be too hard on him. This is a lesson that you both can learn and grow from, and maybe this can be a situation where he can learn to lean on God more. You have to retrain your mind, and that is a very hard thing to do when you have been addicted for years. Pray for him, support him in all ways that you can, and let him know that God loves him and forgives him. 

Best of luck to you both, and God bless you guys"

TrueChristian,ew5x5hb,t3_cmuqq7,1565147413.0,"I think the answers to this will vary GREATLY just because we all have different learning styles. Many pastors/preachers have different sermon styles that project different learning styles. I don’t think we should condemn each other for liking different pastors/preachers. Personally, I enjoy Pastor Craig Groeschel because he really makes Scripture relatable to everyone. He’s one of the main reasons I became a strong follower of Christ, and continue to read and follow the Word of God. That style may not be for everyone though, and that’s okay. But just because that sort of preaching style is different (LifeChurch is very modern and not traditional) doesn’t mean that it’s “wrong”. If a preacher has a different way of teaching, and it leads people to know Christ in the right way, then how could it be wrong? God bless you all"

I’m currently in a relationship with my boyfriend, and he means the world to me!! He’s attractive and he’s everything I need and want. I have watched porn since I was 12 years old, I’m now 23 and I am working on stopping it completely. Something that you have to understand with a lot of people that have tris problem, is that we are addicts. Even though for years I have wanted to stop, I can’t. My mind takes over, and regardless of I’m happy with my significant other my brain want me to watch porn. It is such a struggle...very much like someone trying to stop heroin. It takes over your life...and depending on when he was first exposed to porn, it could take some time to completely kick the addiction. I pray a lot about it and I have made progress! But...there are times of relapse and it sucks a lot. I know this has been a struggle for the both of you, and this makes you feel like you are not valued or appreciated in your marriage, but try not to be too hard on him. Be supportive as much as possible, because he likely already feels like garbage that he is struggling with this addiction. Again, this is just from the side of someone that struggles with porn addiction. I promise he loves you and he values you and everything about you, the addiction is making him do this whether or not he wants it. Prayers to you both!"
