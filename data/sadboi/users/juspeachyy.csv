Healthyhooha,fpqqem9,t3_gero2b,1588829270.0,I HAVE THE SAME SYMPTOMS!! I‚Äôve had nerve testing done because I get it down my legs too. My doctors still have no idea.
Healthyhooha,fb9xk9f,t1_fb84v9n,1576654046.0,"I‚Äôve taken the shot, azythromycin and doxycycline, to no avail. I don‚Äôt need proof that my EX was telling the truth because I know he was telling the truth. Idk what‚Äôs so hard to get about that. It fr doesn‚Äôt matter if he was or not at this point either because I haven‚Äôt been with him in months."
Healthyhooha,fb7lz0x,t1_fb75syv,1576593785.0,"Why should I ask for his test results when I was treated after we were together? Whether or not he lied, doesn‚Äôt matter now because the treatment didn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve been treated for chlamydia twice now without a negative result. He and I have not been together since the break up. Like I said, it‚Äôs not red flags, it‚Äôs no flags since we‚Äôre not together and haven‚Äôt been for months."
Healthyhooha,fb5t2to,t1_fb5nefi,1576533812.0,"I don‚Äôt really understand either because we are open with each other, but we‚Äôre not sleeping together. I texted him just today to ask if he had been retested and he said no so I explained what was going on. He‚Äôs super supportive and he‚Äôs the one that had his heart broken during the break up so it was totally understandable that he asked me if I slept with anyone else. I‚Äôm just over here trying to figure out what‚Äôs going on, not like I‚Äôm hopping back into bed with my ex over here lol"
Healthyhooha,fb5sldt,t1_fb56nvh,1576533556.0,"He didn‚Äôt lie? He wasn‚Äôt cheating and he tested clean. That I am 100% sure about I don‚Äôt stand for any of that bullshit. I know him better than anyone on this site so I am very confident he is telling the truth. And I haven‚Äôt had sex with him since the break up ofc. I‚Äôm not with him anymore so there‚Äôs no red flags, there‚Äôs no flags, just medical concerns now."
Healthyhooha,fb52usp,t1_fb3kum3,1576519933.0,"No not at all. My ex and I were very open with each other and he wanted to help me and figure it out too since he knew all about my medical concerns and problems. He asked ME if I had slept with anyone else after I told him and through tears I explained that I had no idea what was going on and that I was terrified. But he vowed to be supportive even after we broke up and to let me know about any other test results he got back.

Edit since people are misunderstanding. He asked me if I had slept with anyone which is totally understandable since I broke up with him?  He‚Äôs an absolutely stand up guy that tested NEGATIVE. He knew about my history and he was completely supportive when I tested positive and still is."
Healthyhooha,fb51we2,t1_fb3kb22,1576519429.0,"Urgency, abdominal pain, mild to severe urethral pain, pelvic pain, bleeding I think, and pain when needing to urinate (like I don‚Äôt do the potty dance, it‚Äôs now just a deep ache that turns into a sharp pain). And I now have a mild to severe pain in my left lower side that can get pretty bad. My biggest concern right now is that I have PID. I was asking about the left side pain and she said I should get an ultrasound and I scoffed and said that would be my 4th one in the last 2 years for the SAME pain. And they obviously found nothing each time. My game plan now is to absolutely go to a new doctor, I just have stifling medical debt because I keep going to the doctors for the same tests and the same meds with no progress."
Healthyhooha,fb51dnu,t1_fb3hne9,1576519147.0,"That‚Äôs what I was thinking possibly because my gut microbiome is pretty messed up from antibiotic use? I have a messy track record of utis, BV and yeast. And when I took the azithromycin the first time in early 2017, I had a severe reaction and can no longer take it. I get crazy, CRAZY, bad diarrhea and cramps from antibiotics, so my thought was that my body isn‚Äôt processing the medicine correctly it‚Äôs just shooting it straight through."
Healthyhooha,fb5115d,t1_fb3kin1,1576518957.0,My ex and were very open with each other and no I did not see the results both times but I know for sure that he was telling the truth. He was actually really concerned for me and wanted to figure it out as much as I did. And he did take antibiotics I believe since he told his doctor I had it. But he never tested positive.
Healthyhooha,f8bgj0l,t3_dzv7u7,1574436346.0,Oh my god. Are you me? Wow this hit the nail on the head wtf
AskReddit,f792544,t3_dus57f,1573501549.0,"I work as a server so I doubt I would get any extra days off. But as for the M-F 9-5 people, I think it would very beneficial for psyches and energy. As for my job, I think it would actually bring in more business. I feel like since people have that extra day off, we would get far busier and and therefore make more tips."
Candida,f6ngz42,t1_f6nbdrh,1572991299.0,"Not at the moment but I do my best to avoid dairy, gluten, high fat, high carbs and sugar. I‚Äôm planning on continuing that diet but definitely going way stricter during this antibiotic regimen and after. I‚Äôm thinking about going carnivore but meat can make my stomach upset too, so probably going to look into FODMAP."

Healthyhooha,f6kwqxe,t3_drpy2b,1572922640.0,"Hey girl I‚Äôm in the same boat, pissy mom and all! I‚Äôve been having medical mysteries happen to me for the past 3 years. I have constant vaginal problems and imbalances that never seem to go away. I just found out my chlamydia came back AGAIN after testing negative, so that‚Äôs fun. My period has almost completely disappeared and my doctors don‚Äôt know why. Sex hurts most of the time and these weird sores have just started popping up on my lips. First doctor said it was cold sores and I had a panic attack right there in the doctors office and second doctor said it‚Äôs probably staph from the oral thrush I have in my mouth! So don‚Äôt feel too bad, seriously, it will get figured out but right now make a game plan and find a specialist that will really listen to you. It will get better!"

Makeup,f4gn1ox,t3_dkij9l,1571582671.0,"NYX Roll-on Shimmer. I bought one in silver and hands down was my favorite thing I ever bought. I go to raves and it was the perfect quick glitter application, I LOVED it. Ended up misplacing and went back to get another after maybe a year and the girl at Ulta said that they didn‚Äôt make them anymore and I was crushed. Haven‚Äôt been able to find anything nearly as good."
Healthyhooha,f0pb9h8,t3_d60h3f,1568831128.0,"Honestly same here! I broke out in what looked like this rash after some rough sex, bumps everywhere and I freaked out. But I definitely think it is attributed to yeast. If it is a bad infection, or an overgrowth, it can affect your skin. This is just what I‚Äôve learned myself over the years of having severe yeast. Most doctors don‚Äôt really understand the scope of what yeast can do and they can sometimes get it wrong. Like I get bumps from sweat all down my thighs and my butt and I think it‚Äôs because my skin is so damn sensitive now, anything will irritate it. Just got my results back from my doctor and I was negative for yeast but I know that‚Äôs because I have an overgrowth! I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it too much, your doctor will tell you what you need to know because they‚Äôre the professional but just wear loose fit clothing and always use protection when having sex. My stuff will flare tf up if I go raw."
BPD,eys9lrz,t3_cygltv,1567391173.0,"I‚Äôm 22 and my number is excruciatingly high. I try not to let myself think about it any more. But when I do, I tell myself that I‚Äôm so much better than I was. I was so broken trying to find something to fix me, trying to find something to fill that void. Just like an addict, risking life and limb looking for their next fix. But now I‚Äôm in recovery, mentally and emotionally. Your past is your past, but don‚Äôt think for a second that nobody will ever want you or accept you. You have your whole life, and you‚Äôll have people that love you and care about you no matter what ‚ù§Ô∏è"

BPD,ewpwl5b,t3_cpj7p9,1565651056.0,"I‚Äôm not sure what the side effects of lamictal is but to me that sounds like serotonin withdraws? Or just really low serotonin, not sure. Last time I got it was when I got home after a music festival ( after many mind altering drugs) and I thought I was dying and I got sooooo anxious. It scared me so bad. I read in another subreddit that they‚Äôre called brain zaps. But mine eventually faded. I wouldn‚Äôt be too worried about it, just drink water and try to relax and call your doctor and tell them what‚Äôs going on, but you‚Äôll be fine."
Showerthoughts,ewebeom,t3_cnre1v,1565319262.0,"Well for bikinis and such, it‚Äôs about consent. Like walking around in a skimpy bathing suit, you‚Äôre consenting to be seen in that, it‚Äôs whatever.
