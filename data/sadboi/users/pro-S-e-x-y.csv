relationship_advice,ev3m8pg,t3_cici4k,1564197472.0,what sucks more is a lot of my friends are friends with her as well. They all took her side. They started saying things like I'm aggressive or I'm not right for being the way that I am. It made me feel so umcomfortable. I know I mean well and I am a nice person. It sucks because everyone is spreading rumors like I'm such a bad person and its starting to get to me. I lost not only my bestfriend/girlfriend but I also lost a bunch of my friends and I feel so lonely. Everything is starting to get to me and I'm starting to think I am crazy and maybe everything everyone is saying is true. I just dont know why everything is the way it is right now. Im sad everyday and Im just confused because of all these rumors. it sucks because it feels like people are judging me on my reaction. They aren't seeing why I had that reaction. I dont know what to do anymore
