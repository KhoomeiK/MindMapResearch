LockdownSkepticism,fqpuafz,t1_fqpsxq8,1589554102.0,"I think the person who posted this chart used the raw data, and whateve told you the IFR was 1.1% corrected the data for some systematic bias they detected (like the age example used before). 

I have not looked at the sampling methods, so I am assuming the data shown here are correct and collected from hospitals. I would say this IFR is a good guess, perhaps a good upper bound. Because such a huge % of cases are asymptomatic, I think it's far more likely that total cases are more underreported than undiagnosed deaths.  Thus? I would say the true IFR is *less than* the one presented here. But keep in mind that .000001% less is less than, and 100% less is also less than. It would be very irresponsible to guess where in that interval the true IFR lies, but I think it's safe to say after all these months and improved access to testing that the IFR in Spain is somewhere at or below 0.734%"

LockdownSkepticism,fqpsggq,t1_fqprotj,1589553128.0,"I gave a longer explanation in a different reply. I think it should be right below this comment. 

I haven't been following the stats the last week or so. My guess is that the 1.1% number was imputed from antibody testing to get the ""true infection rate"". Its very rudimentary actually. 

If 5% of the population is officially positive and 10k people died if when you sample the population, you see that probably 10% of the population truly had covid, you then have the same number of deaths but divided by twice as many cases. I realize as I type this now that there is no way this is what happened here lol. Most likely they excluded a chunk of people who have not recovered yet so you cant actually count them as ""not dead"".

The thing to know about stats, is that all of the quantitative stuff is done in your freshman stats class. Everything for the next 5 years is qualitative like sampling techniques, interpretation, etc (this is not including stochastics). Which is to say you spend 80% of your time learning how to manipulate data to fit your narrative. Stats as a mathematical discipline is amazing. Stats as a social science is a crime against humanity.

The statisticians here may have ""corrected for age"" by saying elderly are underrepresented in this sample so the true rate when corrected is higher (because only young people got it)."
LockdownSkepticism,fqprmp5,t1_fqpr2mb,1589552679.0,"It's definitely a good point estimate. There are probably people in the denominator and the numerator being under and over reported all for different reasons. Those are 4 independent degrees of freedom. We need to sample the rate of under and over reporting in both death and cases (all 4 categories). I have not seen anyone do this except the few ""random"" antibody tests done (which are probably at least half decent). 

The problem is no one knows how much each of those 4 categories is off by. Then they fixate on one and blow it up with no justification whatsoever. The ""its just the flu"" people will say, theres more infections than reported there for the IFR is way lower. The 
lockdown for 200 years folks say ""people are dying without being tested, the true IFR is way higher"". Both are qualitatively correct but know one has any idea whatsoever how to quantify those values. So people are just randomly picking numbers out of thin air and claiming ""science/math whatever"" on both sides."

I cant tell you how many licensed actuaries I have seen go on tv and say things like ""now you're not allowed to do this, its statistically not allowed, but"" and then present some completely worthless statistics. 

We still have NO IDEA what the IFR is. What we know with tremendous confidence is that it is below 1% and that all of the national IFRs being reported are absolute upper bounds of possibility.

They are basically going to Yankees game, asking only people wearing Yankees Jerseys who their favorite team is and if they say ""I dont have a favorite"" they just pretend they weren't sampled. THEN they say, ya and a lot of people are watching this game on tv. I have no idea how many, it's got to be a million (number out of thin air), so tack on another million to be safe.

Any high school student, by October of their stats class would being able to recognize how absolutely worthless all these ""samples"" are.
