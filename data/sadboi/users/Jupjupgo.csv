I feel depressed from time to time, though not currently. I don’t want to get depressed again. Hope has arisen inside me, and I don’t want that hope to die again.

PS. I can’t solve my problems with my parents either because my mom is responsible for my low self-esteem. She’s called me worthless, useless, etc. a thousand times since my childhood, and my dad has beaten me several times as well. Nevertheless, I don’t want to use my parents’ abuse as an excuse to my problems. I truly want to change. And I’m ready for that."

I chose programming whereas I wanted to be a DJ, an artist, and a doctor at the same time. What do you think interests you the most? I mean sometimes we need to try out different things to see if we’re into them or not. 

If you don’t have any goals, start simple. My first goal was to brush my teeth twice a day. Then I started to make my bed every morning. You can also try setting yourself such simple but effective goals. Do it now. Just now, if you aren’t very busy, take a piece of paper and a pen/pencil, then start writing your goals.
