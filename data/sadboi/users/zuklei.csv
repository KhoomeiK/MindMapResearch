AmItheAsshole,fq0l4v7,t1_fq0ej13,1589033692.0,"Are you fucking serious? This is the most ignorant goddamn thing I’ve ever had the pleasure of hearing from my MIL. 

When, in the course of being a parent, are you forced to put up $29,000 (cash price at my clinic several years ago) all at once? Never. Costs relating to childcare are spread out. IVF clinics want their money up front. Of course you can finance, but if you only make 30k per year you aren’t getting a loan for 30k unless it has collateral. 

I put my MIL on time out for saying that bullshit.

Also don’t forget that 29k is one attempt. It doesn’t work every time, and many pregnancies end in miscarriage. I was fortunate enough to have my IVF cycles funded by insurance. (Anyone reading this needing IVF Walgreens and Starbucks insurance cover IVF). My first cycle resulted in my son, second in a miscarriage, and third was not successful. If I had paid cash, it would have been in the range of 90k. And if my first and second cycles hadn’t been successful even with insurance coverage I might not have gone a third time.
