youre not going to success with film school overnight, but yeah, they will gave you connection, experience and so many things that i can mention to you.

but still i think cinema was a calling from your own soul, if you want to told your own version of story, go for cheap literature course or philosophy, shoot it, keep hustling around until people took notice on you."

but if you not have any time just to cover those windows, just keep your shoot tight. dont take any wide shot.

and maybe you can fix the K on your camera for more night color into your footage.

idk, but good luck man"
