mexicanfood,fpcv24i,t1_fpbt5fi,1588513433.0,"*1 pack fideo
*2 roma tomatoes or 1/2 canned tomato pur√©e 
*One garlic clove or 1 tsp garlic powder 
*1/8 of an onion or 1 tsp onion powder 
*Chicken or veggie stock, can be cubes,   powder or paste.
*Cilantro or parsley with stem or spearmint or mint leaves
*1 1/4 litters of water or chicken broth
Salt

PREP

Toast the fideo first with a little  oil or pam in the same pot you‚Äôre making your sopa, depending on how brown you like it (it does change taste the browner it gets) but it‚Äôs never bad unless burnt.

Blend your tomatoes, garlic and onion with half the water or broth 

Once the fideos are toasted, through a strainer (coladera) add the tomato blend and the other half of water or broth.

If you used water add now the chicken or veggie stock. If you used chicken broth don‚Äôt add the stock, and add salt to taste on either scenario 

Add either the cilantro, parsley or mint

Turn the heat to medium, once it starts boiling (usually takes about 7 minutes) let it boil for another 10 without a lid

mexicanfood,fnp4s9i,t1_fnhok45,1587139210.0,"For skin removal, put your chiles in a comal, griddle, frying pan.
Medium high heat turn them over and let them get black on all sides but once they‚Äôre black take them off the pan, if you don‚Äôt they catch a burnt taste. 
Put them in a plastic bag and tie the bag, it causes them to steam inside the bag and make skin removal easier. Once they‚Äôre cold, peel under running water. Use gloves if you have sensitive skin or you‚Äôll regret it. After you‚Äôve peeled them toss them in white flour ( this is so the batter sticks better) and then stuff them, that‚Äôs the hardest part for me. Toothpicks help a lot, don‚Äôt be afraid to use more than one, sometimes I use up to three. One they‚Äôre fried you can pull them off but always warn people eating the chiles to watch out for toothpicks."
mexicanfood,fnp2jog,t1_fnhozw7,1587138112.0,"For 8 chiles:
-6 roma tomatoes 
-1/8 of an onion white or yellow
-2 garlic cloves or 1 tsp garlic powder 
-2 bay leaves 
-ground black pepper
-1 tsp chicken stock or vegetable stock whichever you prefer
-salt

Blend tomatoes, onion and garlic cloves with about 5 cups of water, you‚Äôll have to do it in two separate batches unless you have a really big blender. 
Blend really well, you shouldn‚Äôt be able to see any onion or garlic chunks.

Put mix in a big pot and onto the stove in medium heat.
Add bay leaves, salt, chicken stock, lastly add black pepper and salt to taste. Bring to a boil and add your already stuffed and battered chiles into the sauce. Let cook for about 10 minutes and turn off heat. 

Also while cooking the sauce you can add more water depending on how you like the caldillo, taste it and if you feel like it needs more flavor just add more salt, pepper or chicken stock (or all three)that depends on your taste. 

Let me know how it turns out if you make it. üëç


I‚Äôm adding a link to show you a seasoning I use and it makes dishes much better, you can find it at most big grocery stores. If you get to buy it add a few sprinkles in your caldillo and to any other dish.
