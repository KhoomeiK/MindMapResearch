AskReddit,fj36bb8,t3_fayx6x,1582969503.0,Long but good! I bike to work and halfway there I got a flat. Luckily I was way early so I patched it on the sidewalk and kept going( I have a pump and patch kit at all times) Then my wheel didnt want to stay straight and I had to keep undoing the quick release and wiggling it into the perfect spot to stay straight. 30 minutes and 3-4 roadside adjustments later I make it downtown to the restaurant I work at. Chef tells me we have a standup comedy event and last call for food will be at 12:30am.... Right on. Naturally I was gonna need a few beers to unwind after work so on my 30 minute break I biked halfway back home to the nearest liquor store and back (slowly and nervously but it went smooth). The night was pretty busy. Was training a new guy and sending orders until 12:45 easy. Got out around 1 and I'm home now. Long ass day but that's a cooks life I guess.

bipolar,fa3sive,t3_e7qn0z,1575797344.0,"It's a tough one man. Had the same feelings with my ex, although I also had pretty strong feelings for her. Was pretty heart wrenching coming to the realization we werent compatible. I think looking at it from a neutral standpoint is the best way to approach it. Do you bring out the best in each other? Do you enjoy spending time together? Do you have similar values and interests? Can you see a realistic possibility of a future together? If not, I would probably reevaluate the relationship even if its painful."

bipolar,f9fzxyp,t3_e4vddo,1575289926.0,"Its gonna be okay man
 Felt very similar at that age. 23 now. Find a meaningful job, try to make good friendships and relationships. Most of all exercise, eat well, and treat yourself kindly:)  don't be afraid to lean into uncomfortable feelings and reach out to those who support you. Life is hard by itself, bipolar is just another facet we deal with. Your not alone, you can do this. We all deal with crazy highs and lows, be mindful its your brain chemistry and stay grounded in the reality things can always get better:)"
tifu,f9fz6rd,t1_f9fr7qd,1575289280.0,"Dude grow the fuck up. So many people at a young age smoke weed recreationally that your argument is invalid and immature. He said himself the box had a combination so no child was ""just going to find it"". How do you even know he was spending his parents money? He's over 18 so he has more than enough justification to make his own decisions. Marijuana is the most benign illicit substance you could possibly use, and as someone who doesn't use anymore you need to seriously research your facts before you post some bullshit tough-love pseudo experienced nonsense."

bipolar,f8ok803,t3_e1dr21,1574684439.0,"I feel it man, currently up at 4 in the morning. Sleep is your best friend when you deal with this b.s. even if it seems impossible. Try a hot shower, melatonin, make sure you exercise regularly. Reduce your caffeine early in the day and eat really good. Just those things help me alot. Just be aware that one night of minimal sleep snowballs into a week of poor mental health and mood swings, it's an ongoing routine staying healthy. Ive found alcohol messes with my sleep cycle now and weed leaves me really lethargic and tired the next day so if your into that try to keep it to a minimum."
