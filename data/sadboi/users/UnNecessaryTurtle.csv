I don't really know what else to say. as I mentioned, there isn't much I can do, but I am still here. and you are still here. it's a lot. it means you survived for at least an hour now. you're a true warrior.

Exercise is helpful and diet can aid your eating habits as it forces you to watch what you eat, but it's important to remember that **self-hatred is not your friend**. Maybe you do have some extra fat, or maybe you don't - I wouldn't know what your circumstances are. But what I learned is that ultimately it doesn't matter how you look, depression will always find something to pick on. If it's not your weight then it's your grades, your artwork, your voice, how you walk, etc etc.

Losing weight won't matter if you're dead. Save yourself first."

SuicideWatch,f9q6vf3,t1_f9nwane,1575556210.0,"That's the point: unlike quitting a job, death wouldn't really set me free. Not in the same way. It's more of a retirement plan. I'd like to make peace with the world before I go, and that includes my bitchy mental illness. Same as I wouldn't retire just because one of my coworkers is a dick, I won't quit living just because my brain hurts."
SuicideWatch,f9m4xo8,t3_e5oqt9,1575441728.0,"I might get banned (what a great start to a comment) but this is actually a difficult question.

I have a life-long mental disorder. I've had it since childhood, along with a bunch of abusive relatives and an anatomical defect that basically sets my endurance stat to -3. In short, I'm an absolute wreck without any future whatsoever. Over the years I've come to understand that no matter what I do, I will never heal. I may solve some of these issues but will always be miserable to some degree. Thus naturally I considered suicide as an escape plan. I wanted to relieve my loved ones of this burden. To escape misery.

And here's the tough part. There is logic behind this wish. It's perfectly sensible to avoid suffering, to strife for release. Not for the benefit of others, of course - but for your own. For those whose life is an incessant streak of pain with no joy whatsoever, death is an option. Suicide is an option.

It's just a bad one.

I've pictured many times how I will die. I've drafted my last will. I imagined apologizing to my family for the hurt this act may cause them.

But in all these pictures, I have found no liberty. Only misery. Solitude. I will die alone, in pain, scared to live, scared of what awaits me beyond the grave. Scared of myself, of the world, of past and future.

I don't want to die alone. I don't want to die just to escape pain. I want to die when all is good and the world is bright. I want to die with peace.

I will never get better. But I will get tougher. I will learn to co-exist with my suffering. And I will die when I want to, not when my asshole brain commands it.

And that's how I'm still alive. I don't know how long I will last. But I know that Death is a bitch, and I'll kick her ass before she gets mine."
SuicideWatch,f9lz698,t3_e5tfi6,1575436102.0,"It's gotten so bad that I am not only expecting death at a young age, I am starting to believe my own body doesn't want to live anymore. It's disturbing to say the least. There is nothing wrong with me physically and yet I ache all over, I'm always tired, it's hard to breathe. Like every system in my body is slowly shutting off. I'd be scared shitless had I the energy needed to express human emotion.

They say it gets worse before it gets better. It doesn't. You just get tougher. And you learn to take it easy, one foot in front of the other. It's enough that you're still alive. Future will wait. Now is more than plenty."
