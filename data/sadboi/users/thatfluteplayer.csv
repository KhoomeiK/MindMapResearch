AskReddit,fi63n85,t1_fi5k5vz,1582177916.0,"I agree, 100%. As an 18 y/o, I may be biased, but there is way too much pressure put onto high schoolers. People always expect more, and more, and more. It seems like you’re never good enough, and every time you manage to get back up after a fall and regain your balance, someone shows up and kicks you back down harder.

Getting into university is really hard. Even applying is a strenuous and nerve racking process. It’s not just filling out a form. It’s essays, personal questions, interviews... And applying to post-secondary institutions is not cheap either. Just applying can cost upwards of $100. Doesn’t seem too bad, until you realize you have to pay that fee for every school you apply to. And the more popular the school, the more expensive the application fee.   And then if you do get in, you end up paying thousands upon thousands of dollars in tuition. 

Exams seem borderline inhumane to me, if I’m being honest. I suppose it’s not the idea of a test itself, but more how much weight is put in it, and how much pressure there is to pass. This is what writing a final is like: You are 17-18 years old, and you’re sitting in a gymnasium that’s been turned into an exam center. There’s a couple hundred desks lined up in rows, each with a test booklet face down, an answer sheet, and a name. Last name, middle, first, going up alphabetically. You find your desk, and sit down. You’re shaking, but you can’t tell if it’s the adrenaline, nerves, or if it’s just cold. After all, you aren’t allowed to bring in any jackets or hoodies. Nothing loose fitting or with any kind of pockets. You look to your right and you can see the girl sitting two meters away from you across the aisle shaking. The boy to your left looks pale. You look up at the giant ass clock hanging on the front wall of the gym. It’s 7:59 AM. Tick, tick, tick... One minute later, at exactly 8AM, a teacher walks up to the front of the room and says “you may begin”. Everyone flips their tests over. Teachers start walking up and down the aisles, looking for any potential cheaters, and matching photo IDs placed on desks to the students writing. You have 6 hours to write two essays. One personal, one analytical. And they better be good. Hopefully the question is easy to write about. But if this is just not a good day for you, you are not graduating. End of story. If you mess up, this could very well derail your life. Your acceptance to university is conditional. It depends on you, a 17-18 year old, scoring high enough on this test to keep your average up to their standards. And if you do happen to mess up, don’t worry, it’s nothing complicated. The university you got into will just withdraw your acceptance to their school. No biggy. After all, you’re really just a name on their list. Click. You’re gone. They’re not gonna care that you got distracted by the kid silently sobbing at the desk behind you. Or by the one sitting across the gym who keeps coughing and is clearly terribly ill, but can’t afford to repeat his senior year. Or by the threatening sound of a teacher’s footsteps getting closer, stopping right behind you, and after what seems like forever, carrying on. Or by your increasing hunger and exhaustion as the hours pass. And they are not gonna care about the girl you saw in the bathroom puking her guts out because her body was unable to handle the stress, or the one sitting on the floor balling because she is so angry at herself for not doing more. She could have sacrificed another hour of sleep to study. That class she missed because of food poisoning? She hates herself for it. But they’re not going to care about her, nor the boy walking out of school with a look of pure fear on his face, as he knows his father won’t be satisfied with his performance, no matter the grade. Or the one who passed out after standing up at the end of the six hours. They just don’t care. Even just knowing that you don’t matter at all in the grand scheme of things is a lot to process."
AskReddit,fi5zp5r,t1_fi5538p,1582174541.0,"I’m an 18 year old recent high school graduate. I definitely think the definition of “weird” has changed over the years. 

Now, it’s generally okay to be “weird”, as in being different. Having different interests, backgrounds, upbringings, ideas, etc. The word weird is still used to describe something that is different and uncommon, but not in a negative way. It’s not meant as an insult.

Thinking about it now though, I’m not actually sure what would be our generation’s equivalent to being the “weird” kid. Us young people are generally very accepting and open to new ideas, and the few who choose not to be are normally shut down pretty fast. Looking back on my high school years, the only people who would get excluded by others were the ones who were bullies, I guess. Those who were intentionally mean to others, or intentionally disrespectful. And that definitely includes being rude to teachers (or subs!). No one likes the kids who talk back to the teachers, even if it’s a teacher no one likes. It just seems to make everyone in the class uncomfortable. Although if the teacher was being intentionally disrespectful towards a student, that’s different, and someone wouldn’t be seen as rude by the student body for standing up for one of their peers. 

Deliberately making someone uncomfortable is also heavily frowned upon, and people who do it are generally not popular at all. Catcalling, making sexual comments about someone... You know, that kind of stuff.

I’m sure I’m missing plenty of important cultural differences between generations. This kinda just turned into a stream of random thoughts, haha... Hopefully it provides a bit of insight though."

That animal was gone. Once, I accidentally killed a pig while trying to get it to my farm. Turns out that was the second last pig, and so I made it my mission to protect the last pig at all cost. I even let him live in my house so that he wouldn't get caught in the crossfire between me and skeletons. I also named him (with a sign; no name tags yet) and we were buddies. Good times... :')"

AskReddit,ffupc4r,t3_euzl8h,1580246727.0,"Nearly all the scenes in First They Killed my Father. I found it to be deeply disturbing, and I was disgusted by how cruel people can be. It was all I could think about for the following week. It was awful and horrific, but in a good sort of way. It's the kind of movie that really makes you reflect. On life, morals, sacrifice, family, war, luck, just about everything, really. To think that the movie's main character was 6 years old makes me feel ill. 

One of the scenes that really disturbed me was when >!the mother tells her two kids (the girl, who was the main character, was 6 IIRC, and her brother I think was older, but I don't remember how old exactly) to both walk separate ways, and to keep walking and walking. Because she knows that if they stay where they are, they will die. And she tells them that they can't go together because then, if they are found, they will both be killed, whereas if they are by themselves, there is a higher chance that one of them with make it out alive. !<Remember, this girl is 6. When I was 6, I was crying over my mom weeding the garden, because I thought the plants didn't deserve to die... I don't even know how I would have coped in a situation like the one in the movie.

Another one that really stuck with me was the scene where >!the camera is panning over all the dead bodies lying in a pit, and the main character's younger sibling is just sitting there, surrounded by death, crying and begging his mother to wake up. I believe that's the last time we saw the younger sibling in the movie, so the audience is left to assume the child died of hunger or dehydration or something like that.!<

I could go on and on about all the disturbing things in that movie, but we'd be here all day. Despite how horrific that movie is, I absolutely recommend watching it. It's on Netflix. But just keep in mind that it is deeply disturbing, and very graphic. And I'm not talking just blood and a couple bullet wounds. I mean the dying-people-with-their-legs-ripped-off-crawling-in-the-woods-begging-for-help kind of graphic..."

AskReddit,fctgoml,t3_eiqdgs,1577942686.0,"Depression and anxiety completely derailed my life. Up until the end of high school I was an honour roll student and everyone (myself included) always thought I would end up being the kind of person to get a full ride scholarship to a fancy college and be in the running for valedictorian, or something like that.

But right now I’m 18, almost 19, and my life is going nowhere. I barely graduated high school, I’m not in university, I don’t know what I want to do with my life, I’m scared, and I’m hopeless. I can’t drive. And I also don’t have a job. I want one so bad but I’m just really struggling just to get out of bed every day, and just googling jobs in my area is enough to get me so stressed out I get nauseous and feel like I’m going to throw up. 

I’m also constantly just labelled as being lazy and a freeloader who lives in their parents’ basement. No one cares how much I’m struggling. They just judge me based on what they see. 

Also as a side note, depression freaking hurts. Like have you ever lost someone, and felt such overwhelming grief it hurts inside your stomach, at the front of your abdomen, just under the bottom of your rib cage? I guess kind of in the general area of your diaphragm? That’s kinda what depression feels like to me, just not quite as obvious. It’s kind of a dull (yet very present) ache in my stomach that feels like I have a black hole inside of me and I’m being flipped inside out. And it gets worse at night, when there’s so noise or anything to distract me from it."

Calgary,ezvl0i1,t3_d2iq7y,1568182668.0,"I'm confused... Why is changing names even important? In the article, it says that the idea is to have all jurisdictions be classified as divisions, so that they can all have the same amount of power. Ok, sure. But why do *names* affect this? Can't school boards with different names have the same rights? Am I missing something here?"
Anxiety,ez2dbsu,t3_czqtqt,1567654433.0,Ugh. Yes. And the worse part is that there’s no predicting it; it just hits. One second I’ll be moderately anxious (nothing unusual though... just like in the “bleh/meh” zone if that makes sense...) and the next thing I know is that I need to find a toilet. Like NOW.

But the company did a very mediocre job so I'm not surprised the construction looks old. I did do theater in jr high, butI'm more focused on music now.

I definitely am not into anime though haha. You're correct about not overly picky about music genres though, but recently I've been more into instrumental stuff than pop/things with lyrics. I like music with a lot going on, multiple layers and stuff. But hey I'm a classically trained musician so I guess that's to be expected... 

The rest is pretty spot on, except for the first letter of my name."

unpopularopinion,eyjei3x,t1_exibu35,1567117639.0,"Sorry, I'm a bit late, but I definitely agree. 

As an 18 year old, I feel that the expectations that society had for teens and young adults is ridiculous. Part of me does agree that it at least *seems* like way too many people are claiming to have anxiety/depression, but to be fair, I can't know that for a fact since I'm not telepathic. And besides, not gonna lie, sometimes I look at the news or the economic status we're heading towards, and I think; ""Why wouldn't this generation be depressed."" I feel like the main emotion that myself as well as my peers are facing is hopelessness. Just complete and utter hopelessness. I feel like I'm trapped in a pitch-black room and I'm desperately looking for a light switch or an exit that doesn't exist. 

The housing market is a joke and seems to be getting worse. For the majority of us, it seems like home ownership is a dream. Not a goal, a *dream*. 

We need to bust our asses off in order to get accepted to university/college, and I feel like I'm drowning in grades and tests and homework. My god, SO. MUCH. HOMEWORK. Apparently, the average time high schoolers spend on homework in Canada is 2hrs, which doesn't seem like a lot, but quickly piles up once you take into consideration that most schools end around 3pm, and kids get home at about 4 or 5, depending on whether or not they take transit or drive, traffic, and if they are a part of after-school clubs. Add two hours of homework, and it's already 7pm. I will say though, most of my friends do much, much more than 2hrs of HW a night. Dinner's a thing, and as a bonus, universities don't even just want good grades anymore, they want passionate, well-rounded individuals. So that means sports, music, languages, etc. Remember; you've been hustling since 6am. Also, not to mention that these classes are things that most successful adults don't even seem to know or need, like calculus, for example. This is NOT just some easy worksheet...So that goes one for three years or so... (or 4 for some provinces and countries I think?)

So if the system hasn't broken you yet and you do make it past high school and into uni, assuming you are not part of the elite, society's gift to you is a debt of a whopping $26,000. A quick google search revealed that the average uni graduate's debt (in Canada) is around $26,000, and takes about 10 years to pay off. It's even higher in the US, and according to [https://studentloanhero.com](https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/), ""Americans owe over $1.56 trillion in student loan debt, spread out among about 45 million borrowers. That's about $521 billion more than the total U.S. credit card debt."" For *education*. WTF??

I could go on and on about all of society's problems, but my point is that we teens and YA are exhausted, all the damn time. We're stressed about money. We're stressed about grades and competitive averages for uni/college admission. We're being pushed through a system that frankly feels like it was built to filter out the weak, except by its standards, the only ones who aren't weak are the rich and the geniuses. And if you're not rich or a genius, then you are indirectly told you are worthless. No well-paying job for you. ""Oh, you're taking an extra semester to finish high school?... *OH. I see...""* ""You're 18 and not out of high school?... *Ooh...""* No concern whatsoever for us as people. And then there's all the older generations telling us that we need to stop complaining and not expect things to be handed to us, when they got themselves through college with a part time minimum wage job, while uni students these days are working two jobs and still come out with a ridiculous amount of debt.

Ok, rant over. Y'all can call me a stuck-up, lazy, ungrateful GenZ-er. I frankly don't care anymore."
