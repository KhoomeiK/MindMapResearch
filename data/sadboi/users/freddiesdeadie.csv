BipolarReddit,fnjh2bd,t1_fnj92v1,1586998821.0,"I've cut back on seeing her in the last 12 months and it has helped me expect less of her and protect myself more. Cutting her out entirely would break my heart because after decades of living undiagnosed and unmedicated I think that a lot of the time she just *can't* do any better. I just never know what I'm getting myself into when I try reaching out. Last week things seemed surprisingly good, the week before she hated my guts.

I doubt that she ever wanted a kid but still she struggled for years to raise me by herself. My father wasn't around for the first 23 years of my life, but he's a warm and friendly guy. He probably wanted a kid (he's great with kids and animals, and it hurts like hell knowing what I missed out on) but they broke up before she even knew she was pregnant and he spilt. I don't think he was sure that I was his kid. They've been remarried for the last 20 years and the last time I was allowed to talk to him unsupervised he told me how awful he felt for having left me alone with her as a child.

 I keep trying in small ways to reach out to my mom but it never ends well. ""You're the reason I want to kill myself"" when I set up a lunch date between us. ""You're not welcome here and if you show up I'll call the police"" & ""if you want to talk to your dad, write him a letter"" (there's only 1 phone and apparently it's hers). Back in October I messaged her a picture of my new cat in and she sent back ""I don't give a rats ass about your cat. Address this shit to your dad.""

I feel bad for my father because he's spent the last 20 years trying to make up for his absence. It's a good thing too because I sure as hell can't cope with her anymore. It'd be nice to be able to spend some time with just him. I don't think she'd allow it though.  He has COPD and I'm especially afraid for his health, so I couldn't see him now anyway.

Neither my father nor my kid are happy about me avoiding my mom,  but I my dad has to *live* with her and doesn't hold it against me the way my kid does. My kid told me repeatedly that I could stop being bipolar if I had the *willpower.* As far as grandma goes... the kid blames his grandpa for leaving her.

I think I've finally learned not to look to her for comfort, lol I don't ask anyone but Reddit for that. I learned long ago to refuse all offers of financial help with the required abundant gratitude (I borrowed $10 in December 2003, because she asked and insisted. I told her I'd have it back to her inside a week and I did. I heard about it every day until I did, and then some). I know I'm pretty old for birthday gifts, and I don't really like having a lot of stuff anyway because the bipolar tends to make me purge belongings. It sucks to be told a gift's coming when it's not though. My expectations couldn't get much lower at this point.

Sorry, this turned into an even bigger rant. Prickly little spider feet on my lips at 5 a.m. freaked me out at first, but after it was gone I was just amused and thought my parents might be amused too, so I wanted to share it."

BipolarReddit,fnj0rzw,t3_g1izkn,1586989818.0,"I get it, I can't even have a pet because I'm just not safe. Not often, but it's ugly. Once when my kid was little I left a thumbprint on the kid's little arm because I was out of control. Daycare asked about it and said they weren't going to report it because they were convinced it was a one time thing, but I asked them to keep an eye on us anyway. That was the worst of it with my kid. If I was about to lose it I let the kid get in the tub and play because he's be happy there for an hour or more. Or I'd send the kid to their room because I was yelling, and go up and apologize once I'd unwound enough. An apology and an explanation went a long way with that kid of mine. 😢

Part of it is paranoia; I struggle with the idea that I am unlovable so I very quickly lose faith and begin questioning the motives of anyone who claims that they love me - for the first 18 or so years of their life I thought that my kid was exempt from that, now I'm no longer needed and even though we'd generally see each other weekly before covid 19 I am more an more insecure about our relationship.

I am always at my worst during a mixed episode. I isolate myself as much as possible whenever I'm down in any way because I'm afraid of the suffering I may cause. I'd love to have a someone to share my good times with but I won't even let myself show interest in someone because of those other times. It sucks. I don't recommend it.

It sounds like you two have a lot on your plate, and trust is *very* hard to rebuild. Like I said earlier, an apology goes a long way, change behavior goes further though and it's great that you're both working on that. Have you mentioned the violence to you Psychiatrist?

AmItheAsshole,fnbiixq,t1_fnb5uqm,1586816136.0,"I wish I could upvote this more. My neighbor and friend always thought I was mean to the kids in the neighborhood when they were young, but whose house did they all want to hang out at? Ours (me and my kid's). There were somewhat strict rules at our house - most covered by the words ""kind"" and ""responsible.""

Your partner's child is already moving away from ""kind"" to ""selfish."" If both of you shirk the responsibility of teaching the child right from wrong you are doing a disservice to them and society as a whole. Try not to think of discipline as a confrontation. ""No,"" rules, and *following through* on consequences are NOT a cruelty; they are tools for shaping a kid into a healthy well adjusted adult. They aren't supposed to be happy about discipline.

Clear boundaries and routines are good for kids. So is positive attention for positive behavior, and repercussions for negative. The neighborhood kids and I would do cool things together sometimes, and sometimes I'd have to send one home for bad behavior. An apology and a better attitude would get them back in the door before the activity was over. The desire to participate and the positive attention always seemed to bring them back to us.

For my own kid, once he'd learned the *what* and *why* of a rule (before he was already in trouble, or after, if it was a new thing - someone said explanations are good for kids and I agree 100%) I usually only had to count. I'd catch his eye and show him my fingers... 1, 2, and at 3 there's going to be trouble. Not that there weren't times that it didn't work so, but he's always been the most reasonable of kids. 💕 I might still be able to count or raise my eyebrows and to make him reconsider his actions, he's in his 20's. 

As for repercussions, I never had one ""go to"" punishment, I just tried to make the punishment fit the crime. Copy lines (I'd suggest ""I am not an adult. I don't make the rules"" in this situation). Or maybe a day without *any* junk food? I'm an asshole so I'd probably order pizza and not share.

Timeout is a great old standby. I wasn't above a theatrical swat on my boy's rump either (met with theatrical tears because mom just broke his wee heart) although I don't suggest you do that with someone else's kid... Missing a favorite show or taking a game system away worked too (I took the power cord from his XBox but have since found out his friend lent him an extra - sneaky fink 🤷).

You still have to respect the kid as their own person. How much do you engage with the kid? Play some board games, have water balloon fights, play with Play-Doh, find a 2 player video game to play together, read a book together. Whatever it is, you need to invest positive attention in the kid. You say over and over that you really do like the kid, well if they like you too they'll want your approval and will (I'm betting) be more pliable.

Good luck!"

Advice,fk4a4qe,t3_fgfrto,1583856410.0,I've been thinking about writing on the mirrors at work with dry erase markers reminding people to wash up. And maybe drawing a set of eyes because apparently just a drawing of eyes helps compel folks to behave as if being watched.

BipolarReddit,fk3fit5,t1_fk3djxe,1583831003.0,"In an ideal world, yes. I live in the US where all of those ""shoulds"" you spoke of mean nothing. The woman I spoke to at the insurance company was the one who *made sure* that I knew that I needed it for birth control. You're right, it wasn't prescribed by my psychiatrist and I couldn't afford to simply elect to have one inserted - the out of pocket cost was over $900. I had had Mirena IUD's twice before that, my psychiatrist was well aware of that fact, and certainly had no objections."

I told her that the next time it happens she'll find out how it feels, and I'll make sure to give it back by to her with interest.

It's not unreasonable to expect to feel safe (it doesn't sound like you do) in your own home. Start saving your pennies and GTFO ASAP."

Edit: One note, check with your insurance before you mention mirena+moods to your gynecologist. I had to tell my doctor that it was for birth control, or else it wouldn't be covered."

YTA. If your brother has been "" trying to win their approval"" and they have shrugged him off or ""actively"" excluded him when she does bring him... Well it sounds like they *do* have interaction with your brother. You can't actively excluded someone who's not there. Not sure what to make of their attitude towards your brother. It could be him, it could be their own assholery.

YTA. You're WAY worse than they are.

I hope you can fix it, if you even want to in the first place. You *are,* after all, the asshole."
