My advice is find a good doctor- I had a good family practitioner I told my story to- he recommended I find a psychiatrist but it was challenging and I ended up going back to the care of my GP for my meds.

There are actually ways in which we can help oppose and contribute to the prevention of these changes. One way is to reach out to local officials and tell them to stand out and fight against these disastrous changes being imposed by the Trump Administration. Furthermore, be on the watch for any demonstrations or action alerts from organizations such as Earthjustice. Through these actions, you can join the opposition against Trump‚Äôs actions regarding clean water.

I feel this way too. I‚Äôve always had these really high expectations of myself. I‚Äôve judged myself very harshly while I people please everyone. My younger years I felt like I needed to be an open book so people would understand me, why I was so ‚Äúbroken‚Äù. People had manipulated me in the past and told me literally I was just that. Fuck that. With a lot of self help and work on myself, also NOT giving people that information about myself- not talking about it, has helped me understand I‚Äôm not that trauma. I‚Äôm not my past. I‚Äôm not broken. I may have scars from the wounds, they will always be there, but they aren‚Äôt open wounds anymore. I definitely suggest having a therapist to speak to when you really need to talk because then you can trust someone with the important hard details you need to work through. But your trauma isn‚Äôt for other people to know and experience. They won‚Äôt understand it. And some won‚Äôt even sympathize, unfortunately. It took me a lot of pain to realize some people just don‚Äôt care. And especially co workers. The less they know, the better. I even had a co worker tell me I needed to find ways to not get raped anymore. Fucking bollocks. I was a hairstylist in a all female room and I had just been harassed by a male massage therapist who worked in a different department. The weirdo came up behind me and kissed my shoulder. I didn‚Äôt even know him. I was telling the girls that I was NOT okay with this and I told management and they told me it was apart of his culture. I told the girls I was talking to it made me puke when I got home bc I was raped before and a woman literally told me ‚Äúwow, we need to find a way for you to not get raped so much‚Äù. How fucking hurtful is that. So you can‚Äôt expect people to get your trauma. Sometimes it bites you in the ass actually. Her comment actually hurt so bad I had to quit. I couldn‚Äôt fucking work with such stupid individuals that would say such a thing and management that thinks a guy kissing the shoulder of a young woman from behind is apart of his culture. Mind you this dude is like twice my age and I told him to his face to get away from me. So literally just protect yourself. That‚Äôs how we stop the trauma from continuing. Learn good boundaries. Learn how to be assertive. You‚Äôll find healthy relationships and they won‚Äôt need to know the details. My husband and I don‚Äôt talk about it and when something is wrong he suggest I speak to my therapist. It‚Äôs nice. We work so well together. We have boundaries. To him, I‚Äôm strong, I‚Äôm growing, I‚Äôm not broken. And just to add something. My husband taught me a lot too. He‚Äôs a veteran. He served overseas and saw a lot of shit. We don‚Äôt talk a lot about it and he likes to keep it in a box. I don‚Äôt need to know what he saw or didn‚Äôt. And it‚Äôs not wrong for him not to tell me. So think of it like that.

Dreams,fo3p477,t1_fo3o3fs,1587490628.0,"Thank you. I agree with your perspective a lot. I‚Äôve recently started journaling after my dreams started getting so graphic and disturbing. To be honest it has really made me release the power the dream had over me. I‚Äôve always been terribly afraid of gore so when I had the nightmare I felt it had really affected me and my day. Once I wrote about it, and realized it was just on paper, it didn‚Äôt wasn‚Äôt as scary. Thank you for getting back to me. I‚Äôm going to actually write this down in my journal. 
Thank you for your time. I hope the dreams have been better!"

‚ÄúMaybe this kid should stop watching so much propagandized media anyway because we all know that this action is not isolated its just the tip of the iceberg‚Äù

How do you know what this child watches and doesn‚Äôt watch? You think Frozen is a propagandize media? Honestly, I have a three year old daughter. Do you know who she wanted to be for Halloween? Spider-Man. She watches Spider-Man. Guess how many barbies she has? Probably over 100. You have no clue what this family does in their free time or how this child behaves when they are not going to the theatre. My best friend is a pre school teacher and her mother. Her son wanted to buy a pink back pack for pre k. She let him! Children are innocent. They are not thinking of sexuality or sexual at that age. You are perverting it. You need to stop politicizing this and take it as it is. A father showing up for his son, giving him the attention and acceptance that a good father should and showing that there is nothing wrong with being yourself. You however are teaching a child insecurity, to shame others for being different. You need to open your mind and your heart. You are the reason I have to teach my daughter not everyone is good and that she needs to always be herself no matter what other people say, and to always be kind. If you are some bible thumper I believe that is what Jesus himself even said. I however am not religious and literally have the sacred heart tattooed on my heart to remind myself to have faith in humanity because of people like you... I‚Äôm sick of the rude and ignorant comments here. Judge yourself. This is a wholesome video of a good father. Go take an inventory of your own deeds and do something to better the world and yourself."

Dreams,fnwgfug,t1_fnqbs4x,1587317906.0,I‚Äôve been dreaming lately about purgatory and hell lately. Last night I had a really awful dream that was almost a bit as you described. It was a meat factory in a house... a man had said before he passed away if he died in the house it would turn into the worst part of hell. All of a sudden the home just broke down and like you said rot and weird gross stuff started happening. I remember trying to leave. I don‚Äôt know why this is happening. I just want this to stop. What did you feel like your dreams meant?

A z pack was one and an inhaler, steroids for my back because of body aches, and my friend brought me zinc and b vitamins with lots of tea. I fought it off within maybe two weeks. But I was sick before for almost a month. The z pack and inhaler is what really helped and I‚Äôm a healthy 30 f."
