learndota2,fjth1qz,t1_fjtao1c,1583607742.0,"Np happy to help. I'm a 5k MMR (4.5k right now after my break sadly) Meepo spammer with 1500 games on the hero.

Terrorblade has a low HP pool and is susceptible to early ganks and magic damage. Meepo can rotate early for no commitment since he can just poof the clone back to mid if it doesn't look favourable. Meepo can max poof for huge magic burst.

Terrorblade's strengths are his physical damage and his incredibly high armour. Plus his ability to splitpush with illusions and flash farm.

Meepo flash farms faster than Terrorblade earlier on. This means he gets his first few items plus his levels much faster than TB can. In a game where I just focus on farming instead of actively winning mid, I can quite easily get 300 CS by 20 minutes plus a few kills when enemies enter ward vision.

Terrorblade's physical damage doesn't help much until later on since Meepo starts the game with 8 armour and builds agility mostly so he will have like 20 armour by the time you see him for the first time.

Meepo deals with splitpushing relatively well and can push faster than TB in the mid-game. So effectively you can go for sub-par splitpushing or fight the Meepo, neither of which favours you unless you get a lucky Sunder and your team follows up with stuns and magic damage.

But this is risky so likely the TB will just farm and splitpush and pray that his team holds out for lategame, only fighting when his meta is up.

But even lategame a Meepo with blink hex can just blow up the TB.

If you're TB and end up facing a Meepo your best bet is to farm and wait him out. Only show up to defend towers with Meta."

LC can't duel Meepo because she will get poofed and die, Meepo also has built-in lifesteal and farms faster.

TB has low HP so a Meepo with an initiation item like Blink and maybe later get a hex can just burst him.

Al's character that never faces the consequences of his actions. Story arcs like with the library girl and the teacher and Momo with her boyfriend who just never show up again and are forgotten.

Look at how Hina disappears from the story and has no character progression. At how they rushed Natsuo's recovery in writer's block for the ending. Look at stupid plot points for forced progression such as the stabbing and the loss of taste and the entire existence of Kajita. Look at the stupid villains that are 1-dimensional like the racist rapist chef guy who I've forgotten because he was so unmemorable.
