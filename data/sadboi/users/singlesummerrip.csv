Horses and mules . They had chickens too and now she won’t eat an egg. Says chickens are nasty and she’s not gonna eat anything they poop out of their butt. Her mom and dads families were even worse off.. they both had about 17 kids each. I gave up on the ancestry tree. Just assume everyone in TN is my cousin. Moved to Florida to safely date people ."
