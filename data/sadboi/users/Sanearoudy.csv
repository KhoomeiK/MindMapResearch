What I do remember was our teacher explaining it to us one day while he was out of the room.

NavyNukes,fowihc4,t3_g9wp82,1588120426.0,"What about all the newer housing? Most of the apartments that students lived in while I was there ('00-'01) have long since been torn down and there's a ton of newer townhouses. I know most of the houses are still there and those were better than the old apartments I lived in! 

My advice is to wait until you get to Goose Creek after boot camp to see what options you have as far as base housing goes. If you don't like what's there you can check out what base housing has listed out in town or what you can find. The biggest problem with getting a place out in town is getting to them before your wife gets there since you won't have a car. As far as being an E-3 goes, most people reporting to the base are! Yes, you won't get a bigger place since you don't have kids but a married E-3, no kids is probably the most common demographic Goose Creek base housing deals with! And it's not like they'll move a student to a ""nicer"" place when they get E-4 either. 

My apartment on base wasn't very nice but they did keep up the maintenance and they have a place you can check out or get everything you need for upkeep as well (lawnmowers, filters, bug bait, etc.). It took me less than 15 minutes from stepping out my front door to being in my classroom if I biked to the schoolhouse and I went home for lunch most days. Remember, the further you are from the school, the less time you have at home, and it can really make a difference if you end up on high plus hours. 

IMO the biggest downside to base housing is when you move out. They have this racket going where you pretty much HAVE TO hire a cleaning person off their list to pass the move out inspection. It cost $150-250 in 2001 so who knows what it is now. I thought our place was pretty good and we weren't going to hire someone until we found out the move out inspection is a PITA schedule wise and what you're paying for is having someone else take care of that. Our cleaner DID say our apartment was much better than most of the places she cleaned and we didn't do any deep cleaning at all!"

As far as your job goes - if you want to be a greenside corpsman then you CAN get it (well, at least the corpsman part). Unless things have REALLY changed, it's way easier to get corpsman as a guy (I'm assuming you're male). Until you sign a contract, you hold the power. If you go to MEPS, have your physical, and get qualified, you DO NOT need to sign a contract that day. If they don't offer the job you want (and you qualify for it) then you can walk and tell them to call you when they have that job. DO NOT sign for some other job to ""hold your spot"" or some other bullshit. If you do decide you want to be a nuke, great! Sign for that (come to the dark side - we have cookies!)
