migraine,fkgbedx,t3_fi5r5k,1584154857.0,"I have lived most of my life with migraines (50 of 60)
I have been working with a specialist for the last 5 years and still was getting migraines so bad and so often I was seriously contemplating the quality of my life, going forward. The only relief was demerol and I limited myself because of it's addictive potential, but I was taking it, on average, about 30 times a month 

Then last December, they stopped. I haven't had to use demerol once since then. 

Since last September I have been on a new injection medication 140mg of aimovig (erenumab)

Also new to my regime was a sinus infection, so I  was on antibiotics for an extended period 

Also new was a new mood stabilizer 

So I can't pinpoint, for sure, what made the difference 

I was able to quit the botox injections, which I have been on for around 5 years 
No more demerol, I was even able to cut back on Tylenol #1"
BipolarReddit,fac5mr3,t3_e8ef5m,1575933913.0,"I was in treatment for years, to deal with self hatred, because of how I have acted, in the past. 
I have gotten to a place where I accept that I was not in my right mind. 

But I have been with my husband for 45 years and am afraid of revisiting my past. He never says anything derogatory, but I feel ashamed for how I acted before diagnosis, especially when I was on steroids for cancer treatment. It really messed with my head.

My psychiatrist retired, and I am left with a void, not dealt with :-("

Psychologists work with how you interpret your life and help you work through issues that could be affecting you.

The difference is do you have a diagnosable chemical imbalance or are your past experiences affecting your future.

Personally I choose both. Yes past experiences are affecting my life, things that have been done to me and things I have done. I find it helpful to discuss the past and learn from it.

I also know medication, properly prescribed, helps me go forward with less incidents that I may regret"
