To me when someone tells me “you are loved” it makes me feel weird and guilty because I don’t feel love. So it either means people do love me and I am broken for not being able to feel it from them, or it means people don’t love me/don’t show me love.

ptsd,fqzbsm4,t1_fqz8c1r,1589764070.0,"Yeah oh man there is so much misconception about therapists AND there are actually therapists who are exactly like how you described and they suck lmao! Well maybe some people like them and it works for some people but it didn’t work for me at all. That’s why people talk about “shopping around for a therapist” which basically means meeting with multiple people until you find the perfect fit. It can take a while which is daunting but it’s infinitely better than seeing a bad fit just to see someone. 

For example- I went to see the first therapist I researched and she literally took out a notepad and asked me 1,000 questions in a row ranging from “were you ever sexually, emotional, or physical at abused” “how old were you when it happened” “who did it” “how is your relationship with your mother” etc etc omfg it was AWFUL! She only let me answer with one word answers and my gut feeling from the second I walked in the room was bad. She even made little comments to herself while I answered her. Needless to say- I never saw her again. Frankly I wish I had just walked out during her questions. It was unbelievably callous and weird to me. She was pretty old so I wonder if it was an older style. 

Second therapist I saw was great and we clicked but everytime I shared something dramatic he would make a shocked/disgusted/surprised facial expression. I asked him 3 times “please don’t make faces when I share things- it makes ashamed”. I think he honestly tried to stop and had good intentions but I ended up stopping seeing him because of this. I wanted to share this example to show that you get to decide if you like your therapist and if they do ANYTHING that makes you uncomfortable and they aren’t able to fix their behavior- you are allowed to leave!! This is about YOU and YOUR needs. 

Then- my next therapist I met with i loved! I walked in and sat down face to face and we just chatted like normal people. She asked me what has brought me to search for therapy and what I wanted to get out of it. We talked about boundaries and how she can make me feel comfortable. She told me word for word “therapy is about consent- I will NEVER force you to tell me anything. Everything is YOUR choice when and what you share and how you share it. We are in no rush”

I clicked with her as a person and we just had a comfortable energy from day one. 

Sorry for the long rant but I just want you to know you get to pick your best match and please take your time. It will make or break your experience with therapy. Good therapist DO exist. So do bad ones/bad fits. 

Really sending you my love dude. Best of luck!"
ptsd,fqz7y3t,t1_fqz0gsl,1589761762.0,"I can’t imagine how hard it must be to be coping with the loss of your father while also watching your mom grieve her husband. That sounds so hard and I’m so sorry, I wish I could take the pain away for you. 

I totally get that the lockdown makes it even worse. 

Of course I understand you don’t want to talk about it yet and it’s so fresh. I just want to say one more time that getting into therapy soon is so important - even if you don’t talk about your dad at all. 
When working with a trauma therapist trust is huge and takes a long time to build. No good therapist will force you to talk about your trauma before you’re ready. I didn’t even tell my therapist I was raped until I had been seeing her for about two months and the details came even slower after that. Trust takes so much time. 

So even if you started seeing a therapist today, you are in charge of your sessions. You could talk about your dog, your friends, the lockdown, your mom being sad, you could even just talk about coping techniques to sleep better and get through the day with less pain- ALL without giving her any explicit details  about your dads death. 

When looking for a therapist I would basically say “I recently experienced a traumatic event watching my dad pass away. I know I need help processing this but I am not ready to talk about it at all yet. Can we work on coping skills etc before I am ready to face it” 

So many people go to trauma therapy who don’t even remember any details of their trauma- so talking about the actual trauma isn’t as important as some may think. It’s incredibly flexible and so helpful. 

Just my two cents. I wish I had stated therapy way sooner. You know yourself better than me, or anyone here on Reddit. Love yourself, be gentle with yourself and stay safe. It’s gonna be okay"
ptsd,fqw7sbl,t3_gl9wmh,1589695316.0,"I know witnessing a Gand Mal seizure can be terrifying. If you don't know what it is, people often think their loved one is dying. I'm sorry to hear you are feeling alone through this. 

First, yes, being exposed to real or perceived death/endangerment/extreme bodily harm can cause ptsd. Note that the definition includes real or perceived. 

Second, PTSD is usually diagnosed by a set of symptoms. To be considered PTSD I think you need to have symptoms for at least 6 months. It makes total sense that you're still very shaken up about this because it happened so recently. My understanding is that a doctor would not diagnose you simply because it was so recent. 

Regardless of this- get into therapy now. It is a well recognized fact that the sooner you get into therapy after a traumatic event, the less likely you will be to develop PTSD. Processing it while its ""fresh"" will allow you to develop healthy neural connections around your narrative of the event rather than negative ones. 

&#x200B;

An example of a positive narrative would be ""I did everything in my power to help my loved one and even though it was scary, I feel confident in my abilities and my decisions"" vs. a negative narrative being something like ""The safety of my loved ones is out of my control and I will never feel safe again"""
fosterit,fqtembp,t1_fqrlmav,1589637446.0,"I am so sorry the people who should be protecting you are failing you. 

Yes, this is abusive behavior. 

As another commenter said- DOCUMENT. EVERYTHING. Here is an excellent way to document abuse: 

1) write yourself an email. Write down in as much detail as you can all the inappropriate events that have happened so far. Include dates, times, everything you can remember. 

2) from here on out, for every new instance of abuse- reply to yourself on that original email. THIS WILL DATE/TIMESTAMP THE ABUSE. This is critical to demonstrate an ongoing pattern of abuse from your parents, your caseworker, all of those fuckers. 

3) as time goes on, every new instance, hit reply.

Yes this can absolutely cause ptsd. Ptsd is really just diagnosed based on symptoms and you can google those easily to see if it feels right. I also think you need to be experiencing the symptoms long term for it be ptsd but like I said, I have no doubt that you could develop ptsd from this. It’s a little early to call it ptsd but it can develop into ptsd easily.


Please consider getting into therapy for this now- SPECIFICALLY with a trauma therapist. 

When first responders such as firefighters, emt, police and evening military members encounter a trauma event on the job- they are required to have trauma therapy within 72 hours of the event. 

Studies have shown the sooner you begin healthy processing of trauma - the less likely you will have chronic ptsd. It’s all about addressing it now because if you leave it alone and in the dark- it will grow like a mold. 

Pain doesn’t stay the same when you put it on hold to feel it later It gets bigger.

I couldn’t make it through your entire post because it was so triggering to me and I relayed to it so much. I basically got through the first 3 paragraphs. 

This is my mom. Every detail. I have been her emotional crutch my entire life, starting as child. She has never met my emotional needs but she has cried to me about her countless times. When I would bring up pain in my life, or ways she has hurt me, she inevitably begins crying about her childhood and her pain. 

I even tried to go to a therapy session to repair our relationships and instead of talking about us, she cried the whole session about her marriage and her childhood. 

Look up emotional incest and parentification. These are what you are experiencing and yes they are considered abuse and yes you can develop ptsd from them. 

I’ll leave you with this- I turned 25 and told my mom I can’t take it anymore. I told her in clear words “you cannot come to me for emotional support. I am not going to play that role in your life. Yes, you deserve emotional support and connection, but I’m not going to be that person for you. You can confide in your friends or a therapist” 

This was very hard to do as she had no close friends and I felt so guilty. She guilted next and said she always comforted her mom so why can’t I comfort her?? 

I told her no- just because you did this with your mom doesn’t make it healthy. You cannot talk to me for emotional support. Period. 

Maintains this boundary was damn near impossible so now two years later I am completely no contact with her.

ptsd,fptid4s,t1_fpti0tb,1588891803.0,Yeah. It’s why I find it really hard to be open around anyone who hasn’t experienced trauma. It’s an inherently isolating experience.
ptsd,fpti8sr,t1_fpru6tu,1588891739.0,"How is gaslighting a form of love? 

We live in an age where she can go on the internet and learn about ptsd and learn about mental illness and how to support her daughter. There’s really no excuse for ignorance. 

By telling OP that love = her mother minimizing her trauma and blaming her for choosing to “stay in the past” - you are basically telling OP that abuse = love."
ptsd,fpthy31,t1_fprnc4r,1588891580.0,"Just got wanted to voice an opposing opinion. 

In my opinion she is not being supportive and trying doesn’t actually count for anything. 

I grew up being abused by my mom. Everyone would tell me “well she’s your mom, she does love you and she’s trying to support you”

What this taught me was that love = my moms behavior. It meant love = screaming, name calling, gaslighting, all of it. 

Now when people tell me my mom loved me I tell them no, she didn’t. Because that’s NOT what love is. It’s just not. 

Telling a victim that their abuse is actually just misguided love and support is probably the worst thing you could do for them."

ptsd,fpthfzw,t1_fpstnip,1588891314.0,Exactly. It feels like they’re telling us that we’re choosing to dwell. I hate this way that ppl think ptsd works
ptsd,fpthd1v,t3_gf576u,1588891271.0,"Yep I’ve heard the same thing. It insinuates that we are choosing to dwell on the past and that it’s a choice to be ill.

Just like you, I know this is my own insecurity and projecting. All the abusers in my life told me I’m melodramatic and an attention whore. I know in reality I am a very private person and they would say this to me to invalidate my abuse and make me keep quiet about it.

Regardless I can’t help getting irritated when I see people publicly brag about it. I know it’s not bragging but it feels that way to me."
ptsd,fpgboe0,t1_fpgaaba,1588599297.0,Man I relate. I spent a year with a non trauma informed therapist because it was so hard finding a new one. Same I thought it was better than nothing and his website said he took clients with PTSD lol. That’s how I learned accepting clients with ptsd and being trauma informed are totally different things. I spent a YEAR with him before I realized that I was out of his scope/his abilities. I wish he had known and cut me loose instead of me having to make the realization that I wasn’t getting what I needed.
ptsd,fpg9v7h,t3_gd4ph0,1588598080.0,Yes. Like another commenter said I often hear my abusers saying my name or cruel things. But it feels like in the background whenever I find silence throughout the day (especially at night) I find myself repeating “no” and “help” over and over in my own voice in my head.
ptsd,fpg9qgi,t3_gd7r6g,1588597992.0,"When will my trauma be enough? 

I’ve never read it/seen it stated this plainly and this is exactly how I feel. When will my trauma be enough? When I finally kill myself? 

I have flashbacks, nightmares, dissociation, self harming behaviors and rituals, avoidance, SI. And it still feels like what I experienced wasn’t “bad” enough. 

I relate so much."
ptsd,fpg9jw7,t1_fpg7wjm,1588597866.0,"Wow I am so sorry to hear about your therapist. That just made my jaw drop.

CatAdvice,fp65d3j,t3_gbff0k,1588346370.0,"You need to learn the turtle technique buddy. 
Allow me to describe: 

The cat is awake. First he’s meowing, then he’s slapping ur face or poking you. He wants food. 

In one swift motion you pull all your bed covers over your entire body. Use your feet to flip the end of the blankets to be tucked under you. Everything is tucked in and you are now inside a blanket fort akin to a turtle being inside its shell. 

The cats tiny claws can’t reach you through the thick layer of the down comforter. The meows are muffled. 

This is my only solution 😂😭"
CatAdvice,fp64xiy,t1_fp64le2,1588346144.0,Haha my does too! I actually compare his chirps to sounding like a little cricket. It’s rare he ever does a normal meow sound.
CatAdvice,fp64bib,t3_gbihd8,1588345821.0,"I have a cat and dog who are best buddies!! 
I got the cat first as a baby and around 10months old I brought the puppy home who was 4.5 months at the time. 

Kept them separate for about 1.5 weeks- the only time the cat saw the dog was when I walked the puppy out through the house to go pee. Dog on leash and cat free. 

My cat was super curious about the dog too- he would just sit on the other side of the door where the dog was and wait lol! 

I just wanted to assure you it’s very possible for them to become friends!! In the early stages once I let my dog off the leash to explore with the cat he did chase my cat a few times and I just scolded him appropriately. Now they play and wrestle together al the time :) 

I think it helps having a very well trained dog who knows the command “gentle” and obviously “no”"
CatAdvice,fp63wz6,t3_gbj9gn,1588345601.0,"Spray bottle! It’s really all I know that works. 


I hate spraying my cat it makes me so so sad.

ptsd,foyo6an,t1_foyfwja,1588176064.0,"Not sure why you were downvoted if you’re asking a genuine question. I relate to what the above person was saying about dopamine. 
There’s no way to my knowledge that people can actually measure or know scientifically if they’re dopamine/happy hormones aren’t working - but it’s pretty easy to know because the biggest symptom is depression.


when I talk to my therapist I often find myself saying “I feel broken.” Or “I feel like my brain is broken” and I’m referring to my dopamine/seratonin etc. I feel this way because when I do things that used to bring me joy- it doesn’t make me happy anymore. Or when I do things that typically people say make them feel good, it doesn’t work for me. 

Example- I used to feel amazing after a hard workout. All the happy hormones pumping. Now I work out and I feel nothing, if not worse because I am disappointed. To me that’s very clear that my brain is not producing hormones correctly or adequately. 

The next step for people like me is to take medication that helps your brain produce these hormones. 

Just my two cents!"
CleaningTips,foujda2,t1_fouf99f,1588085144.0,Haha that actually makes a lot of sense. Like the other commenter said i guess it makes sense for larger spaces. I feel silly asking now.

Veterans,forashj,t1_for0r1b,1588009078.0,"Hmm. Yeah it’s hard being clear and weird to talk about such an intense topic bluntly but I literally have told my command and my therapists “i think about suicide every night. I think about it being inevitable and knowing I will die from it eventually. I got a dog and cat to prevent me from killing myself so I don’t have an active plan but it’s on my mind constantly” 

You can keep it as simple as “I think about suicide. I think about methods, about timing etc. But I have not chosen a plan or intend to do it. I need help managing my thoughts because I’m afraid they will get worse” 

Good luck dude. I think even saying what you said here is good- saying I want to be truthful and get the help I need. They might suggest a residential facility or outpatient facility. I have willingly done both. I think having a history of self reporting and being honest really helps them trust you and not make them want to 5150 u"

Veterans,fo5lw9m,t3_g5qey9,1587528920.0,"Here’s my experience having told multiple military docs and Va docs that yes, I am suicidal. 
I say yes I struggle with suicidal thoughts often. They say “do you have a concrete plan?” I say no. I’ve never been even close to being involuntarily admitted. It could also be because I’ve self reported through the entire course of my mental health battles so maybe that helps? 
Whenever they bring up the “have you had thoughts of hurting yourself or others?” I just give them a little background and say yes but my PCP knows about it, my therapist knows about it, I’m here because I want help and no I don’t have a concrete plan. Never had a problem. 

If you say “yes I’m stockpiling pills/bought a gun/chose a bridge/wrote a will” etc then they will probably feel obligated to hold you."

Wish I had better advice! Can you walk your cat? I think outdoor fun helps them leave indoor plants alone."
