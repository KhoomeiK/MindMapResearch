depression,fqsw0xx,t1_fqsvqcy,1589620905.0,Thank you! I'm glad there are educators out there like yourself with a passion for education. Haha I might need that luck so thank you!
depression,fqsvgmn,t1_fqsteuu,1589620306.0,"Thanks. I remember a topic I discussed with my therapist was ""why are you a student?"" and my initial answer was ""I don't know, I just am"" but I gradually remembered how much I loved to learn and how I wanted to help others so I went into the psychology field to help people like me. I remember feeling proud telling my therapist and feeling excited to be able to tell myself I graduated but... it just feels hollow. Right now, I'm just going to try to enjoy this time of self-isolation as like a stay-cation and then trying to find a job even somewhat related to my field, which is a hurdle all on its own lol"
depression,fqsv2hh,t1_fqstckc,1589619883.0,"I was lucky but I worked my ass off to graduate. I'm 26, I had to take a break for my own mental health and went back with all of my savings from my scholarships. I put literal blood, sweat and tears into graduating, into doing so much to accomplish these goals. Societal success doesn't mean much to me personally, due to how differently people define it depending on their trade of work and the culture they were raised in. I know I still have a lot to learn, about myself and my field, but I guess I just envy those that can feel that sense of pride"

Anxiety,fqclbh0,t3_ghuv3o,1589261282.0,"I'm so proud of you!! Taking that first step to st least allow someone else to help you is such an important first step! I hope your therapist is s good fit for you, my therapist told me that after a few sessions if there was anything she could do to help me feel more comfortable because she suspected that with my anxiety, I wouldn't have said anything lol. This is what she told me... if after a few sessions you still feel uncomfortable, make sure you talk to them. They're there to help you, help them do their job and try not to feel bad about it. I hope this helps and potential issues and I wish you good luck on the path!"
depression,fqckgr4,t1_fqacs35,1589260598.0,"Yup I remember turning 10 and thinking ""Is this what life is? Just progressively getting older without knowing why we're alive?"" Like holy shit, why wasn't I in therapy sooner lol"
depression,fqacbhj,t1_fqa2x3p,1589216628.0,"I had a friend that told me this is her life pretty much. She just wakes up, deals with the day and doesn't experience the loneliness, the sadness, the excruciating pain of existence and is baffled by my depression. It blows my fucking mind, I've never lived life without some kind of looming awareness and depression, even as a kid"
depression,fpv8rw2,t3_gfg4h2,1588938629.0,"I'm like this too and have friends that have this habit. Just say hi, I don't care about the apology because I'm just glad you decided to say hey. I try to send memes periodically to those friends that tend to isolate and it doesn't take away my own loneliness but one time a friend told me how much she appreciates just knowing I'm thinking of her even when she can't reply because of her anxiety/depression and that keeps me going during dark times."
depression,fpv87fy,t3_gfhpr2,1588938135.0,"It's hard but you can't compare your progress to anyone else's. You live with demons and constantly live through hardships that others may never know. Live life at your own pace! I'm 26, barely graduating college and most of my friends have been working for years but you know what? I'm so fucking proud. Sure it took me a lot longer BUT an accomplishment doesn't get taken away just because of how long it took. Be proud of yourself. If you had a friend that struggled and came up to you, proud of something they did, you'd be proud of them too right? Learn to be kinder with yourself, it takes practice though so just don't give up!"
depression,fp5utp7,t3_gb8bjf,1588340398.0,"Depression and suicide makes you want to take control of whatever you can because everything inside of you KNOWS that you aren't functioning as you should. Having that sense of control, to at least be able to tell yourself that you can go away on your own terms, taken away and having an official date... I can't imagine how absolutely terrifying that must feel. ""Sorry"" isn't fucking enough, but this hit me. I've been putting off various health issues (thyroid problems that aren't bad YET) but I don't want my life to be taken away from me. Thank you so fucking much for sharing. I wish I could thank you in person"

Anxiety,fn9ng4h,t3_g02gqq,1586779324.0,"I feel you. I usually only feel this way around my parents (which makes the whole ""you have to stay inside with your parents"" a whole hell of a lot harder) but sometimes, I find myself with the strength to say (mentally of course) ""go fuck yourself, I'm doing fine"" to that vicious voice in my head. We know ourselves better than anybody else, no matter how much they THINK they know you, you're the only one that knows your true thoughts and beliefs and actions. People will always judge, they don't know the demons you deal with and yet, you still find the strength to seek out help from strangers lol. I wish you luck"
depression,fn9n03b,t3_g0b70h,1586778912.0,"Yuuup you're definitely not alone. I realized I was depressed when I was 10 and it doesn't go away. Over the years (I'm now 26) I found out it runs in my mom's family, she's been depressed since she was a teenager too. Something I like to think about when my meds aren't functioning as well as I would've hoped, is that depression comes in waves. Some days or weeks or months are fucking hell itself but PLEASE know that these times will pass and one day you'll feel better enough to do something nice for yourself, to be kinder to yourself. It's all about celebrating the little things and the steps you take when you're at that point. Other days, it's about managing to wake up the next day and maybe rolling out of bed. I literally have no reason for being depressed and when I list everything out, I know I should be grateful and happy but... I'm just not. I dunno if this is helpful but I'm rooting for you OP"

Anxiety,flmsz76,t3_fpm7u6,1585295348.0,"Good for you for seeking help! I have a close friend who had a horrible experience with meds (she has PTSD and severe anxiety) and so when I was diagnosed with chronic depression and GAD I was scared to take meds. Thankfully, meds have been an overall positive aspect in my life but the first meds I were prescribed weren't great. I had a phase where my doctor and I were just seeing which meds helped me feel better, I felt like a fucking guinea pig and my mood was all over the place. Again, I'm still glad I decided to stick with it because my depression is SO much more manageable and I'm not an anxious mess when I try to sleep. Good luck!"

It's ok to let yourself be sad, grab your favorite foods and watch some good movies/series"
depression,fjqzdzv,t3_feh19t,1583579591.0,"Yup this happens to me all the time. Usually I'll try to make plans but I'll add ""I've been having a rough day/week/whatever"" and that's my way of telling my friends that my depression is beating me down. I don't always make plans and add this because I hate myself lol but I try. I've also recently been thinking my future self as another friend so I'll think to myself ""what would make future \[insert name\] happy?"" Maybe it's tidying up your clothes off the floor, maybe it's buying your favorite fruits and vegetables or just preparing a future snack even if you aren't hungry. Future you will be hungry and grab that quick snack, they'll see the clean floor and be glad past you gave you this gift of kindness. This helps me be nicer to myself when I can only depend on me"

I'm trying to be more genuine around them but hearing that makes me want to push it down and not actually feel it and genuinely improve. I'm just trying to not make the people I love more miserable at this point but I have no doubt that one day I'll reach my limit and die by my own hand"

I've got fucking nothing besides working on myself like journaling, making the effort of a pOsItIvE mInDsEt but it just doesn't seem important since most people don't have to constantly deal with these issues.

The doctor always checked and I have pretty good vision otherwise so I figured the lines were normal especially since most of my family and all of my friends have terrible eyesight. My doctor always said it could be an acute nearsightedness due to staring at my computer all day. People around me STILL don't believe me that the lines around the lights aren't normal and tell me I don't need my glasses. People are incredibly stubborn

Even though I fucking love smelling like lavender and delicious soaps after coming out of the shower, I rarely take a shower more than twice a week. I'm still going up and down, sometimes it feels like things are getting easier and then I end up falling again. But regardless, I'm proud that you're taking steps to take care of yourself :)

I had all of these various plans today to leave the house and get some work done (because I feel too depressed to do anything productive at home) aaand I ended up not leaving the house or getting out of my pajamas. But at least I took a shower last night so I'm also still proud that I'm still clean lol.  
Even if you don't believe in yourself sometimes, there are more baby steps involved than you realize and just finding that motivation to even be comfortable and do the things that make you happy and involve taking care of yourself in small ways like this help out a lot.   
Good luck on your journey dude"
Anxiety,erwh41v,t1_erwba7b,1561343421.0,"I'm sorry you had to go through that. I'm sorry your mom never got the memo to respect you as a fellow human being. Being 25, confused and broke lol, I dunno what I would do without her. If you asked me last year, I'd say she was holding me back because of her criticism but now I have the strength to say and do things she may not approve of but she can say to herself ""this is what she wants to do, this makes her happy and isn't harming anyone, I have to respect it."" I got lucky that she is this open-minded, I know that now"
Anxiety,ervw0id,t1_erv14z2,1561326451.0,"Absolutely, completely agree. I was an emotional sponge for my mom that had depression and didn't even realize why I had so many issues until I finally went to a therapist semi-recently. Having boundaries and talking to someone else about what may or may not be appropriate to let your child know is incredibly important. Not only was I the emotional sponge, but whenever my parents fought, I was the mediator to calm them down, I am also my mom's only friend. These things take their toll and I've had to ask her ""are you telling me this because we're friends or because I'm your daughter? Because as your daughter, I'm not comfortable with this topic"" and she'll remember. 

Talking to a professional and learning how to recognize your triggers and lessening the effects without having to depend on your daughter so that there are less people out there like me that had unhealthy and exhausting relationships with their parents."
Anxiety,ervve33,t3_c451cx,1561326001.0,"Your daughter is truly amazing. I remember when my mom was upset or depressed, I'd always give her this heart plush that had this amazingly, sweet scent and so whenever she saw it, she remembered that I loved her and the scent would remind her of all the good things life has given her (or it just smelled good and I'm reading too much into it lol)."
Anxiety,ervuzbi,t1_erv1zem,1561325708.0,"There are a lot of us that had to be that emotional sponge as a child to help our parents cope with their own demons. I finally cracked at some point when I was in college, talked to a therapist, got put on my own antidepressants and they both said ""your parents never set up boundaries. It's ok for them to be open with you and for you to be open with them but if you feel like you're reaching a limit, tell them. They'll be upset but you have to be consistent and eventually through communication, they'll respect the boundaries that are healthiest for everyone""

From what OP described, it seems that she's trying her best to not sponge off of her daughter but rather had a random panic attack and her daughter tried to help in any way possible, by slushing her in all of her favorite things to make her happy. There's a line, of course, between healthy and unhealthy emotional boundaries but I'm hoping that with younger people learning more about mental health and the internet, there will be fewer of us that had to be the emotional sponge of the family."
depression,ervtzdh,t1_erunkdd,1561324988.0,"No problem, being in high school or in any kind of young, hormonal age can make it difficult to see someone as just another human being but believe me, most adults can't do this so I'm glad you were willing to listen to some doofus on the internet lol. Good luck with everything else!"
depression,erumpvh,t1_erum03u,1561288613.0,"Dealing with it/ignoring it. It's only awkward if you think it's awkward. Awkward only exists when both parties have a social understanding of some behavior as awkward so if you just keep doing your work and talk civilized, she'll (hopefully) get the hint and you can treat each other like adults. Adulting is just pretending that everything is fine and saying ""hello"" even to an ex because they're best buds with one of your best buds, it's what you have to do and is easier than making something awkward by being weird, staring, etc. 

Also sorry if this makes no sense. Take my advice with a grain of salt, it's 4 am where I'm at lol so I'm very tired but I've also lived through all of this so this is the first thing that comes to mind AKA maybe don't follow this advice, it's your life so it's ultimately up to you."
depression,erumhwb,t1_erum04o,1561288283.0,"It's both, I got lucky because I inherited my depression from my mom so she gets it but my dad said almost exactly what yours did. Besides, no matter what our fathers think about depression/suicide, it's their OPINION which doesn't make it a fact. Sure it hurts that they don't understand or don't want to listen but life DOES get better. Either moving out or having more time for them to see that it isn't just a snap and suddenly everything is better. It takes work on both sides but even if they don't understand, it's not your responsibility to make them understand. You'll find friends and people to understand so you don't feel alone. If all else fails, you've got this subreddit and you can always chat with me if you need someone to listen. I'm going through a hard time since everyone's busy, my mom can only be so proactive before she gets frustrated as well so I gotchu"
depression,erultwr,t1_erulle5,1561287267.0,"Time can change a lot of things. Killing yourself sounds good because it eliminates a lot of temporary issues that feel gigantic and unmanageable. But relationships ebb and flow, I used to think my parents hated breathing the same air as me until I finally grew some balls to tell them what's going on and it's still difficult but much better. Friendships change too. The friends I had a few years ago are practically strangers compared to the friends I have now, not to mention that I have more friends now to count on as opposed to maybe one in the past. 

Killing yourself stops all types of opportunities for growth and to get that taste of peace and joy in your life. I've tried to kill myself when I was around your age and I'm glad it didn't work because even though I've suffered through heartbreaks, both romantically and with friendships, I like who I am more often than when I hate myself. Time can be slow but before you know it, it'll fly by and if you work and practice introversion and mindfulness, you can become someone you're happier with"
depression,erulmk8,t3_c42dkz,1561286945.0,Time. You let time pass and eventually they stop being at every place you're at. I know this isn't a quick solve or maybe even the tip you were expecting/wanting but time really does solve most issues
depression,eruljo4,t3_c42hzq,1561286820.0,"I empathize with you. Birthdays are the one day where it should be the perfect time of the year for people to show that they care but rarely does someone else see it like that as well. I feel you though

If it helps at all though, I wish you a very, very happy birthday from Las Vegas lol. Do something you enjoy doing, even if it's by yourself as a way to make yourself happy :)"
depression,erulfw9,t3_c42iav,1561286658.0,"If dumping her really makes you think she'd be happy, you're dumb. I know y'all are young but talk to her, tell her what's been going on and after all is said and done, explain that these are things that neither she can help with and you don't have the tools to help yourself either. Don't let her blame herself for something she will always wonder if there was something else she could've done. I'm speakin from an extremely biased perfection from being that person being dumped and the person who's dumped other people due to depression. It'll suck, it'll hurt but PLEASE don't hurt yourself. There are many suicidal hotlines and even just on here, people listen, people understand. You're not alone in feeling like this, being 15 and depressed/suicidal SUUUUUUCKS to put it mildly but if you can survive this, you can make it through anything. I believe in you dude"
Anxiety,erruiu2,t3_c3faxe,1561184095.0,"Proud of you, taking that step and acknowledging progress ain't fucking easy"
Anxiety,erqrx37,t1_erprih4,1561150547.0,"Friends who care you you enough to listen will try to understand what's going on. I've been lucky enough to have two groups of friends:one of them understand anxiety, depression, AND introversion and the other don't BUT they listen and say the typical ""just go outside and make yourself feel better"" but I know it's coming from a place of positivity. They also understand more when I'm at my limit and say ""sorry I can't come tonight, having an overwhelming day and just need some time alone"" and while they'll grumble the next time they see me, they'll accept it at the time and say things like ""hope you feel better"" without guilt tripping me. This took A LOT of time and patience but it can be done.

All I can really say is that accepting your own limits and faults and communicating it to other people is a BIG step that doesn't come overnight, this took several months of therapy but I'm sure the people around you would appreciate that"
Anxiety,erqqqiv,t3_c38tyu,1561149738.0,"Anxiety is a terrible monster that convinces you the worst of yourself and of other people. What I've found to REALLY help is just being honest. If someone texts and you feel too anxious to reply, don't BUT once you do feel ready to reply, let them know ""hey sorry I didn't reply sooner, been really anxious and it's hard to respond on time"" 

And trust me, people don't hang out with annoying people, they care about you and everything you have to say. If you're going through a tough time and need to vent, just do that and if they're a good friend, they'll listen.
From one anxious hermit crab to another, hope this helps lol"
HeadphoneAdvice,ermemdz,t1_ermedjb,1561018445.0,"I was just comparing them to some other headphones I have. I directly compared them after getting them in the mail and at the same volume level, they were noticeably quieter while listening to a song I had playing on spotify without an amp (which I also don't own)."
HeadphoneAdvice,ermdjgm,t1_erfyl4e,1561016806.0,"So I decided to give these a shot since I saw other users on this subreddit recommend them and while they're INCREDIBLY comfortable on their own, they're really quiet compared to everything else I own. Are yours quiet too?"

HeadphoneAdvice,erguivf,t1_erg8nha,1560858254.0,"Lol I actually googled these and was incredibly disappointed by reviews and the specs; especially for the price, there's just so much more out there now for something on a budget. I understand that headphones are pricier but there's more market for things on a budget. I'm just not as in touch with the new market as I used to be so I was hoping reddit could help me bridge the gap between what amazon reviews tell me are great and what is ACTUALLY a great deal"
