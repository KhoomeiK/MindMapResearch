However, no has really responded to my core question as to why many white people have such ingrained hate for black people when they seem to have the upper hand in most areas of society like wealth, job opportunities, acceptance, achievements, respect, freedom to do as they please without repercussions, political power, etc. The list is pretty long but I will stop there. It seems counterintuitive that one group with such overwhelming advantages and history of abusing another group would hold so much hate against the weaker abused group. One would think it might be the exact opposite in a nation that espouses a strong affinity for Christianity. It's baffling to me."

UpliftingNews,fpuekoc,t1_fpuc1wx,1588910970.0,"Thanks for your reply. I appreciate it. I'm sure there are black people who  viscerally hate white people but that's my point, they have really good historical and unfortunately present day reasons for it. Just pick up any nonbiased history book or today's paper. And yet you don't see systematic efforts by black cops killing white people for questionable reasons or stories like the one in this post. Given the continued aggression and violence aimed at black people you would think there would be lots of high profile acts of violence by black people like mass shootings at country western concerts perpetrated by black people all the time as payback for centuries of obscene treatment at the hands of white people but it hardly ever happens. Yes, there are lots of examples of white people getting mugged or robbed but these are mostly economic crimes brought on by economic necessity. White people tend to have more money than black people as a whole so it's just logical. If you want to debate this go right ahead. My point is the level of hate as seen on most white supremacist speech, writing and violence is off the charts compared to anything I've seen or heard from black people. It just seems so out of balance given the vastly more negative experience black people have had in this country. I just don't understand where you it comes from and I don't understand why black people seem to return the hate in anywhere near the equal measure. I guess MLK won over black hearts more than Malcolm. Seriously, help me understand why white people keep beating black people down when they clear won the war for dominance long ago."

We don't pursue anything any more unless we can make money out of it. Many new promising technologies also conflict with current very profitable ones. For example most alternative energy sources like solar and wind power directly conflict with the massive profits made from fossil fuels so there is a major repression of those technologies. There are probably thousands of other promising technologies that are significantly better than existing ones that go nowhere because people haven't figured out how to make enough profit from them. We're trapped in a no innovation zone where truly useful things are abandoned because of the requirements of capitalism. The last truly innovative age that happened without profit as a driving force was during the space race. Lots of innovations came out of that time because profits were not even considered. Now all we have are planned incremental improvements designed to make things just better enough to get you to buy the newest model. No breakthroughs just new versions of the same thing.

I'm still trying to wrap my mind about what I saw  but I think you are on the right track. However, the one thing your theory ignores is all of the things that happen which aren't the result of choice. You mentioned the weather as one of the potential elements that can have a significant impact on what happens to all people who are impacted by it. A person can choose to not go out because it's raining or not which may change that person's life trajectory significantly. But if the weather was an F5 tornado that greatly limits the choices a person can make that day and probably for a while especially if they die from it. Anyway I'm not sure if this makes any sense but the show made me think about deterministic pathways versus how much impact human behavior and decisions have over the future. There just seems to be forced in nature like extreme weather, earthquakes, asteroids hitting the earth and a lot more big rocks in the flow of time that the impact of human decisions seems trivial in comparison. I can't wait to see where the show is going no matter what because it is making me think about reality in new ways. Thanks for your post."
