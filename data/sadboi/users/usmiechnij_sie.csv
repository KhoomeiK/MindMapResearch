UKPersonalFinance,eu4lrsb,t1_eu4ljoc,1563457508.0,"Congratulations! That's really good news. Hard work pays off :)

That's why I made this post, so my story isn't the other way round. So far, it seems like the problem is really with procrastination. Maybe I'm overthinking this budget thing, but it is on my mind."
UKPersonalFinance,eu4lg28,t1_eu4jhw9,1563457266.0,"I had quite good study habits when applying to university. Ended up getting 4 A\* in my A-levels, an A at AS, and a pass in the STEP III paper. I'm still very proud of that!

During university I went a bit nutty. This changed a lot of those habits but I'm still here :)"
