SquaredCircle,fc40vqh,t3_eg1fzc,1577403696.0,"In my opinion, a jobber is any wrestler who you're nearly or totally certain is going to lose their singles' match *before the match starts*. It's not how often you lose so much as how predictable your loss is ultimately going to be.

I think each promotion handles the concept a bit different -- NJPW doesn't really need jobbers, they have Young Lions and their booking allows a wrestler to look great in singles' losses; WWE has 50-50 booking a lot of the time; etc. 

The way I define it, AEW has a ton of jobbers. You could easily say Jungle Boy/Marko Stunt, Leva Bates, Peter Avalon and Brandon Cutler are all super jobbers, with Jack Evans/Angelico not very far behind. For me, watching a Cutler match in particular is a waste of time because I know Brandon Cutler will lose that match -- it sucked because the Sammy G match from earlier this week was great, but even commentary's started to give the general ""no one works harder than Brandon Cutler!"" trope - a surefire way to tell the viewer you're not giving that wrestler the win. You go into a match knowing each of these wrestlers are either losing or taking the pin in their matches. That to me is a jobber."

I will say most Hiroshi Tanahashi matches are *fire* — he has the consistency and in-ring knowledge of Bret Hart and the charisma of HBK and Randy Savage, all out to one man. NJPW in the mid-2000’s was in as bad financial shape as 2000 WCW (the promotion was sold for a measly $6.5 million and that might have been an overpay) - Tana stuck around and basically saved Japan’s main promotion from eminent collapse.

SquaredCircle,f8rz03f,t3_e1oc4f,1574760363.0,"They push Britt over *everyone* sans Nyla, Riho and finally, Hikaru Shida just last week. It's so hard to get people like Big Swole or Kris Stat or hell, even Hayter properly over if all of them are just going to be fed to Britt. She needs more of a gimmick or character development aside from ""I'm a dentist and I fight hard and my finisher is great"" - there's no humor or storytelling in that and part of that isn't her fault.

There's also the ""Adam Cole's girlfriend"" thing that WWE basically made a prop out of at WarGames; it's an image that can get exploited by WWE to again, reinforce her as only that - even if both Adam/Britt or even AEW sees otherwise. It's bad optics for her -- Papa H saying he didn't know the shot was coming and only recognizing her *afterwards,* as the match went on, reeks of bullshit.

AEW openly caters to hardcore fans, so telling those fans that *their* most favored women's wrester is, again, the girlfriend of a top guy at another brand as name recognition, you're fucking up. That's all on creative: Matt and Nick stupidly made a gag out of it on ***BTE Story*** **that involved Britt.... briefly playing scared otherwise ""Adam gets it!"" -- it's not like the EVPs are making this any easier. Needs to be fixed.**

Whenever Britt gets a lukewarm or negative reaction or has a forgettable match, the fact that *all of us know the EVPs knew her well before they started the promotion* will come up. After all, AEW's original fans are just BTE fans. It doesn't matter that Kenny has probably been connected to every other women's wrestler well before the show started and we know Kenny has a good rep w/ showcasing joshi, it matters what we *think* happened. Also, Cole just main-evented Survivor Series.

The simple way to fix this is to stop pushing her so aggressively right now and let her naturally get over because she's a decent wrestler."

he’s over as fuck, a sex symbol as far as NJ goes, and the light routine is great. but dude has zero personality, it’s adorable."
