india,fqwbiyv,t3_gl8kbr,1589698665.0,"Hi op,  I am from conservative family born and brought in a small town.  This opinion is from a guy who grew up in a conservative family and had conservative friends. 

When I was a teenager I wanted to Mary a beautiful virgin girl but now my mind set has changed drastically may be because i did my higher education in abroad that changed how I view things.i think it’s depends on that person first try to get to know him see what type of guy he is. Tell him about your virginity if he’s really bothered by it  don’t marry him. By doing this your avoiding a hellish life.

me and my friends talk about marriage often and we are ok with marrying someone who’s not a virgin but if you had any small flings and one night stands then that’s going to be a big problem I would suggest you keep it as a secret. The way I see it is that if you want to have sex first get to know that person and try to get close to him on an emotional level. 

When it comes to drinking. I’ve shared apartment with my classmates(Indians) during higher studies and they used to  drink every day until 3 a.m they used  to bring women(Indians) with them and I’ve seen 2 types of women. 1. Women who drink very conservatively may be a glass that’s it. 2. Women who drinks 3 bottles of alcohol and makes a lot of fuss.  I don’t like the 2nd type be it a guy or girl.  From a conservative family point I would say if you want to drink alcohol do it when your alone or with your husband and close friends. I’ve seen a lot of great arranged marriages."

Supports lpddr5 and 120hz.



The Exynos 990 complements these modem speeds with a very wide memory bandwidth that supports LPDDR5 data rates of up to 5,500 megabits per second (Mb/s). The processor also features a 120Hz refresh-rate display driver, which makes games come alive by reducing screen tearing and enabling smoother animations even on devices with multiple displays, such as foldable phones. Also on board is an advanced image signal processor (ISP) that supports up to six individual image sensors with concurrent processing of three; this enables pro-grade photography, with resolution up to 108-megapixels.

Exynos 990’s inclusion of an embedded Arm Mali-G77 GPU, the first premium GPU based on the new Valhall architecture, which improves graphic performance or power efficiency by up to 20 percent. This comes in addition to an overall 20-percent performance boost from an extremely powerful and flexible tri-cluster CPU structure that consists of two powerful custom cores, two high-performance Cortex-A76 cores and four power-efficient Cortex-A55 cores.
