politics,fi15yh4,t1_fi0sdt1,1582051291.0,"This describes my boomer parents perfectly. Both of my grandfathers were in Europe in WWII, one in the Battle of the Bulge, and I'm 100% sure that they both had severe undiagnosed PTSD, especially my mom's dad. He drank a huge jug of wine and smoked non-stop every day from WWII until his death in 1994 (surprised he lived that long to be honest). He was so grumpy all of the time, and my mom acts exactly the same way. Fortunately, I figured it out a long time ago, and now I call her out on her grumpy ways and don't take things she says/does personally. My dad cannot process personal feelings at all and always changes the subject when something comes up. Fortunately, both of my grandmothers were amazing despite their damaged husbands and I miss them very much! Given hindsight and my subsequent maturity, I would have loved to have talked to both of my gradfathers about WWII, but they both intimidated me when I was young."

My mom donated a kidney to me in 1994 and I don't really know what she went through as I was dealing with my own massive changes. I think she was out about 6 weeks. But she's had zero problems in 25+ years since the surgery. Did you have regular surgery or laparoscopic?  A friend of a friend just donated last week and I am curious to hear about her recovery and to compare it to yours.
