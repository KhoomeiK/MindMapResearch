I honestly never felt much respect or love for my parents. My dad was an alcoholic with type 1 diabetes so he was essentially killing himself slowly over 15 years or so. He was always kind, but I didn't understand addiction, and I always felt like he didn't love me enough to stop. I am ashamed at how I took advantage of his guilt and let him buy me expensive things when he didn't have much money until I was probably 16. As I matured I started trying to take care of him more, but at the same time I had my own shit and so I didn't see him much. He died when I was 20. I wish I had gotten a chance to spend time with him as an adult.

My mom was always angry. Yelling at my dad, at me. Looking back, of course she was angry. She was the only one trying to be responsible, while my dad was drinking himself to death. As a teen she testified in court against me, wanted me ""sent away"". My dad refused. At the time, he was my hero. I got to stay and keeping getting fucked up every day on whatever I could find, self harming, having unsafe sex, acting on my every fucking impulse, taking so many risks it's amazing I made it out relatively unscathed. Looking back, I realize my mom was willing to spend thousands so I could go to a very expensive residential program for teen girls, in what she saw as an attempt to save my life.

Now, my relationship with my mom is ok, but I don't think we will never be close. She generously let my daughter and I live with her for 2 years, and she continues to help us with money. She knows my diagnosis, but still doesn't understand my illness. I doubt she ever will. My main issue with her is that she is just still so angry and it is hard to feel ok around her. She snaps at my daughter - called her a bitch at 4 years old. So, while I appreciate all she has done and continues to do for me, I just don't really want to be around her very much."

Let's fix that and make it just about physical preferencess, as a trans woman is just like any other woman, and may or may not have certain physical attributes.

In general, replace the word ""trans"" with another marginalized group - in my last example I chose Asian people due to their diversity, which still doesn't match that of the trans community.

You see, I still plan to kill myself. But not for 20 years or so.

>really didn't intend this to become an argument about me getting a cat

It's not about the cat. It's about the fact that you seem to acknowledge that taking certain actions would make you feel better and possibly enjoy life, but you make excuses and refuse to act to possibly save your own life. 

I don't know why - you say you are just lazy and would rather die than attempt to make your life better. I guess your argument is that this laziness is all there is to it, but frankly, that seems like bullshit. The reason people don't believe you and won't accept that your are ""fine"", just want to die and that's ok, is because most of us have seen and experienced suicidal thoughts, especially in the context of a diagnosed mental illness, and we know it's not ""fine"". You admit you have an untreated mental illness which causes suicidal thoughts, low self esteem, low motivation, hopelessness, depression, etc, all things that can be treated, healed.

No one can make you value your life enough to choose to live. All the rational arguments of all the commenters here can't do it. It's up to you to decide to try. However it is you can find value for yourself, whether it is through family, friends, or others and their feelings about you, any small amount of self worth you can muster to decide you want to *try* to survive, or at least allow yourself a *chance* of happiness before you go... 

Well, it's up to you. Everyone here, although we don't know you, we truly want you to have a chance to feel better, because many of us have felt the same way when we were younger, and we all are at least somewhat pleased we made it to the other side.

I think I may make a separate post about it. I don't fully understand the whole ""red eyes"" thing, but I can only assume the point is that the woman is made particularly attractive because she has a penis, and I suppose it implies that trans women are some type of bisexual fantasy because they are ""both"". Which, as you said, has nothing to do with bisexuality, and is either third-gendering or fetishising trans women.

So, basically, the alternative, trans-inclusive meme would be - A person attracted to women takes home a woman, who turns out to be trans. Nothing happens. She is still a woman. The end.

BipolarReddit,fqo8m13,t1_fqo5in5,1589509823.0,">I don't think it matters very much. Either it's just a fundamental part of my personality and that's that, or it's a symptom that has been part of my core thinking, planning, the way I react to things, etc for so much of my life that it might as well be a fundamental part of my personality.

I happen to think it matters quite a bit, but obviously you may disagree. You say it's been that way for so much of your life, the implication being it is permanent - frankly, you haven't been alive very long. Neither have I, comparatively. But if you are interested in scientific fact to justify waiting to die, your brain is not fully developed, and won't be until you are *at least* 25. The way of thinking that has dominated your brief life may bear little resemblance to your way of thinking as an adult. I am not trying to be insulting, but it is a scientific fact that your brain at 19 does not have the ability to think as rationally, and understand long term consequences, as it will when mature. Your brain has a biological tendency to rely on emotion over fact.

As for getting a cat, I have been involved with animal rescue for years. Adopt or even temporarily foster a cat over 7 years old and you will be saving its life. As one of the many things in life you have yet to experience, this may be something that causes you to enjoy living, or at least prefer living over the alternative, knowing over the remaining 80% of your lifespan you could save dozens of animal lives. Again, clearly just my perspective."
BipolarReddit,fqnrcvj,t1_fqnjqje,1589499972.0,"Honestly? I don't know. I don't deny that the ""suicide is bad"" perspective is likely social conditioning more than it is based on any kind of objective evidence. Most recently it's part of ""life is precious"" sense of morality that is rooted in religion, and likely dates back to the necessity for humans to survive to reproduce and provide for their children. I do understand your point. It's your life and if you want to end it that is your choice...but.

The big ""but"" here is whether your desire to die is a conscious choice you are making with a clear mind, or a *symptom* of mental illness. Most people will assume it is due to mental illness, and that proper treatment may eliminate this symptom, therefore letting you kill yourself would be failing to save your life through proper treatment. Even when people are terminally ill and desire assisted suicide, they must prove it is not due to depression. It is not your job to prove that to anyone, but it may be worth asking yourself.

Even if you decide that it is not a symptom, but your own choice, you may want to ask yourself if life is worth living - even for a short time. For me, it's about the idea that something good could happen, and a kind of curiosity about life that is partly why I stay. Also, personally, I base a lot of my self worth on helping others, and I feel there is more good I can do before I die, but that alone is not enough for me either. Your right, killing yourself is ""definite"". Life is uncertain. Some of it will be shit. Maybe most of it. But some might be good.

You say you've always wanted a cat. Well, if you die, you'll never get to have one. Why don't you deserve to get what you want out of life before you die? If you look at it from a purely self-serving perspective - nothing wrong with that, why shouldn't your life serve you? You want a cat? Get a cat. You want to go to Hawaii or Brazil or Kenya or whatever? Make it happen. Just my opinion, but I wouldn't want to die until I have gotten everything I want from my life, or at least tried to and gotten as much as I can. If you have no hope of getting anything good out of life, to me that sounds like a symptom of depression, which brings us back around to the beginning.

Just something to consider. But ultimately it is your choice, and it's not bad or wrong - but it is *final*, and most of us here want to stop you making such a final choice before you have tried other alternatives, as some have found solutions that made them happier in the end."
BipolarReddit,fqn17ac,t3_gjtev8,1589486945.0,">sometimes I see posts from people who used to be suicidal complaining that they don’t have the option of the easy way out anymore

Full disclosure, I am one of ""those people"". 

I can't remember as far back as you do, but since 12 or so have been thinking about suicide. I also had a couple of half-assed attempts when I was younger around 13-15 (now turning 30). I always took comfort in the idea that I could control when I would die - I can't remember a specific ""expiration date"" anymore but it was probably similar to yours, definitely didn't plan to hit 30. The one thing that kept me alive from 16 to 23 was my dog. I remember writing out notes and when I got to the point of giving my dog away I just couldn't take it, he would have been so sad, he was like my baby. 

Speaking of babies... I got pregnant at 23 after a period of impulsive, risky behavior that, looking back, hints of hypomania. My dog died while I was pregnant, but after I had decided to keep the baby, otherwise I am certain I would have followed him. I considered giving up my baby and dying right after she was born, but somehow decided to stay. So here I am. Single parent of a 6 year old, and suicide is ""off the table"" for me until she is an adult. Not completely sure I will be able to stick to that, but I am trying, for her sake rather than my own.

I haven't give up on suicide though. I am just waiting until she is grown and ok on her own. I also will adjust my method in an attempt to cause the least amount of pain.

My only advice to you is to try to find someone or something to live for, even temporarily, just to try to push that date as far into the future as you can. My continued existence has always been due to something outside myself that motivates me to continue. I won't tell you to take suicide out of your plan altogether - I know that can feel impossible. But if you just keep saying ""not today"", not this week, this month, this year, you may find that you get a chance to experience something you wouldn't have wanted to miss."

If you do care about this kid, and understand that kids with family problems often experience behavior problems, and then you should be willing to be understanding about that, while at the same time trying to get on the same page with his mom. The whole ""I would have never gotten away with that"" or ""No son of mine"" doesn't really work in this situation, because his experience of family and security are very different from a 2-parent home.  I would say that you and his mother need to work together to make sure the kid feels safe and secure and does not fear your relationship will take away from the mother/child bond, and also continue with the group activities so he feels included in the relationship while trying to find a way to build up to having more time alone that doesn't make the child uncomfortable. IMO any relationship with a single parent needs to move much slower to allow the child to adjust and feel secure - if you care about this family and want to be involved long-term, you may need to be a bit more patient."

Other comments have good advice, but I wanted to reply to this statement in particular. Bipolar is a spectrum disorder, and anyone who has bothered to educate themselves, which seems to be most people on this sub, knows that. I personally have BP2, so at times I have felt similar to what you feel, that I have had it easier than those with BP1 because I have never suffered full mania.

But as I have spent more time on this sub, I see that most people seem to understand that each of us has our own struggles, regardless of diagnosis, and those struggles are valid and deserving of acknowledgement and treatment as much as any others. Play the ""who's Bipolar is worse"" game benefits no one. We all have a serious illness.

So try not to worry about feeling like a ""liar"" because you have not had a mental health emergency during mania. Just try to focus on being honest to yourself and your doctor about your symptoms so you can get effective treatment, and know that the purpose of this sub is non-judgmental support, not ranking symptoms."

bipolar,fp7ca0j,t3_gbo8d2,1588367927.0,"Many people share this concern, especially about certain bipolar meds due to negative stereotypes. At one time I felt drugs like Depakote and Seroquel were used for turning angry, violent teens into zombies - this was based on my experience in an adolescent psychiatric hospital day program, where the doctors weren't exactly conservative in their approach to medicating kids. The belief that meds turn people into zombies has a basis in reality, but like most stereotypes does not begin to tell the whole story.

If you do choose to look into medication, you will find that there are dozens of different meds that can be used to treat bipolar, in practically infinite combinations. This is both a positive and negative - negative because it may take months or even years to find the combination that works best for you, but positive because if you end up on med that makes you feel like you are ""not yourself"", or has any intolerable side effects, you can tell your doctor and they will work with you to correct the issue, as there are so many other options to try.

If you have given any med a good trial, and you don't like how you feel, then you have every right to ask for a medication adjustment, because whatever you are taking is NOT working properly. Bipolar meds should smooth out the peaks and valleys of mania and depression to allow a person to experience healthy emotions - not eliminate emotion altogether.

P.S. Remember how I used to think Seroquel made kids into zombies? I now take a fairly high dose of it and it is the most effective medication I have ever tried (in addition to Lithium which many people have stereotypical views on).

Yes, many of us do. For many of us it may take months or years to find medication that works, and even then it may not be 100% effective at eliminating episodes and symptoms. If you found meds that keep you completely stable without difficulty, you are lucky to have that, you need to understand that not everyone is so lucky. And also, depending on how long you have been stable on meds, know that you may relapse as well.

From the International Bipolar Foundation:

However, if the person is already monitoring and controlling their blood sugar, it might not be a serious problem. It is likely a case by case situation, which would simply require a conversation with their endocrinologist to answer whether it is safe for them or not.

Definitely  take it slow and have someone there as the other comment said.

Of the things OP listed, I would say a bit of Xanax to just chill may be pretty safe, plus you could look up drug interactions as it is frequently prescribed w/ bipolar meds. Just be careful - it is super addictive. Painkillers, muscle relaxers, same deal - might be safe, you could even ask a pharmacist since they are legal - but I personally would say no more than once a week, to avoid a devastating addiction."

I don't mean to be dismissive, your feelings are completely valid and you have every right to feel hurt right now. But I got a feeling from your post that you are quite young, which a quick glance at your profile seems to confirm. Nothing wrong with that, but I  remember being your age and everything feeling so extreme, devastating, hopeless, my whole life is shit... These feelings are real and valid, but they are not often based on objective fact, and when we are young we tend to lack perspective that we gain as we age. 

You say that people have rejected you for your entire life. This may be true...for your entire life so far. If you are only 18, you have so much time ahead for things to change. Especially with mental illness, the teens and early twenties can be extremely difficult, definitely was for me, I had a really hard time with self-harm and suicidal thoughts. I am nearly 30 now, and while shit still sucks a lot of the time, and the thoughts are not totally gone, I am doing better w/ meds. I can usually put things into perspective and realize good things have happened in the past, and will happen again in the future.

Try to take care of yourself to get through these difficult times - life may never be easy, but good things will happen if you stick around."
bipolar,fnyfei2,t3_g4l2m9,1587361467.0,"I have BP2 - mostly depressed ~ 70-80%, sometimes mixed ~ 10-20%, only occasionally pure-euphoric hypo ~ 5%. In my experience, having mixed episodes does not mean you will never have a pure hypomania - my episodes may fall anywhere on the spectrum from hypomanic to severe depression, they just tend to be more depressed or mixed."
bipolar,fnxfwfz,t3_g49qnd,1587337787.0,"There is not really such a thing as a ""formal service animal"", unless you mean a dog rigorously trained by a service animal agency, such as dogs for the deaf or blind - these animals often cost tens of thousands because of the amount of time (several months to a year + ) professional trainers have put in.

That kind of training is NOT required for a dog to be a ""true"" service dog. A service dog is simply any dog that has been *task-trained* to assist a person with a disability. There are many disability-related tasks a psychiatric service dog can be trained to do, and they may be trained by their owner - there is no requirement for ""professional training"". Dogs can be trained to alert, interrupt or assist a person with certain behaviors, including hypo/manic behavior, paranoia, self-harm, anxiety, crying, etc. 

There are are many resources online to help you find tasks that would benefit you personally. Here's the catch - it takes work and commitment on your part to train a service dog. You may need help from a professional trainer, especially if you are not experienced with training, but I personally would hesitate to have a psychiatric service dog trained entirely by someone else. Our symptoms and needs are so different for each individual, just like there is not one ""bipolar medicine"", there is not one ""bipolar service dog training"". Keep in mind, if you want the dog to be both task-trained and public-access trained to acompany you places that don't normally allow pets, this will take much more time and effort.

I had a dog years ago who was trained to help with my paranoia and anxiety. I recently adopted a dog, and he is an ESA for now until he is acclimated, probably at least 3 months, at which point I will begin training him to perform tasks specific to my needs (I have a lot of experience with training dogs). I don't expect that he will be considered a ""service dog"" for at least 6 months, and probably will not be public-access trained for a year, if ever.

TL;DR - If you are willing to invest the time and energy, you can have a service dog, but it won't happen overnight."
bipolar,fnxclpg,t1_fnwuuwz,1587335922.0,"Interesting. Just took this assessment, feel like I am moderately depressed right now, but scored ""severe"" (3 points away from ""extreme""). Shows how relative the concept of severity can be based on past experiences - if you have never been depressed before, ""moderate"" may seem ""severe"", but if you've been depressed a lot, ""severe"" is not so bad.

Also, while obviously one test of 21 questions can't address all symptoms, I found it interesting that *lower* levels of sleep and appetite were indicators of depression on this scale, while for me it is quite the opposite.

Thanks for sharing this link, very illustrative of the diversity of symptoms on the depression spectrum."
bipolar,fnwyilw,t3_g4anhd,1587327959.0,"I'm sorry you are feeling this way. Trust me, you are not the only one who has felt insecure in a relationship, and it seems like you have good reasons to be uncertain.

I am far from a relationship expert - honestly if anything I am an expert in unhealthy relationships. If you are looking for answers, I would suggest looking beyond the relationship to see if there are patterns you can identify. 

For example, does he seem to lack passion or enthusiasm in other areas of his life, or just within your relationship? If the loss of interest is widespread, he may be experiencing depression - not that it would be an excuse for hurting your feelings, but it is something he could seek help for.

On the other hand, do you tend to feel insecure in other areas of your life? (no judgement here, I am very insecure) You say you don't love yourself, you are not alone in that either. But if he says he loves you, and you can't believe him, your self-esteem may be a *part* of the problem.

I have never been married, my longest relationships have been around 4 years, but it is pretty universally recognized that marriage is not easy. Maybe you need to work on your communication or other aspects of your relationship. If he will agree to couples therapy or even to do some reading with you about healthy relationships, that is a good sign of his commitment, IMO.

I hope you can feel better, about your marriage or maybe just about yourself."
bipolar,fnv5oub,t3_g3y62b,1587281120.0,"Copied from my previous comment on a similar question:

When I started Seroquel it hit me like a truck. I took 25 mg at about 9pm and I was physically unable to get out of bed until after 2pm the next day - not just tired, I was dizzy, head pounding, felt lightheaded and weak... I was terrified of taking it again, but I did, and the second day was so much better, by the third day I was nearly back to normal. This pattern repeated, although somewhat less severe, each time I increased my dose, so I learned not to increase unless I could spend part of the next day resting. 

I began seeing significant improvement, at that time in a mixed episode, at around 200 mg. Currently at 600 mg, feel it is extremely helpful for hypo/mixed symptoms, suicidal/self harm thoughts/behaviors, and somewhat helpful for depressed mood. It works better than any other med I have tried (at least 10 other meds over 15 years off and on). It no longer has a sedating effect for me at night, but can make it s bit harder to wake up if I don't get enough sleep.

If I miss a dose, I start feeling ""buzzy"", ""prickly"" or unstable the next afternoon/evening. I take a couple 100mgs during the day, and full dose at night, but will almost certainly feel ""hungover"" the next day. Try very hard to never miss a dose."
bipolar,fnv1ynk,t3_g3wuug,1587277619.0,"My last (and longest documented) hypo episode I was in for 2 or 3 months, had a few pseudo-crashes in the midst of it, a couple times I would be crying, extremely upset, other times it would be a few hours of pure exhaustion, but the next day back on a high again...this continued until I tumbled into a fully mixed episode for a couple more months. 

Is is ""normal""? Idk, but it has happened to me, and my experience on this sub is there is rarely a symptom/experience that no one else can relate to.

Keep an eye on things, keep in touch with Dr, therapist, whoever, so you have help for when the real crash comes. Stay safe."

You are doing great. You are not failing - you may struggle, but I've never known a good mom that didn't struggle. A bad mother would not be concerned about failing - the fact that you are shows you are a good mom. Things will get easier, your child will grow and although it will never be ""easy"" it is definitely better when they get older and more independent, you will get through these difficult times.

Give yourself a break wherever you can, even if laundry and dishes have to wait. Everything will still be there if you take a 15 minute break - maybe take a long shower, or take a walk alone, or lock yourself in a room w/ headphones blaring music...whatever helps. Do your best to make sure you are eating and sleeping.

I'm sorry you are having trouble with feeding - if you haven't already, maybe talking to someone from La Leche League could help, or maybe you could get WIC or SNAP (if you're in US) to help w/ formula costs?

Remember - if you ever worry about not being a good mom, that itself is proof that you are a good mom 💙"

But please remember - you deserve meds that work and don't cause intolerable side effects. The options are nearly infinite, so don't give up if it takes a while. Work with your Dr, follow their advice, but be honest with them and let them know if you are not satisfied with your meds.

Also - I highly recommend tracking your moods, either w/ an app (e Moods, Daylio) or another method. Sometimes we don't even know meds are working unless we can see the data to back it up."

It's not just you - I have had only 2 jobs with significant responsibilities and high stress - both made me at high risk for self-harm/suicidal behaviors, both times I stuck around way too long. Trying to ""power through"" can be dangerous - you need to take care of yourself the best you can, that doesn't make you a ""pussy"".

As for excuses you could use something like gallstones - I have had them, got severe abdominal pain in upper-right quadrant, sometimes the pain is so bad it leads to vomiting.  Episodes/attacks happen for a few hours at a time, but sometimes they repeat every afternoon/evening for days or weeks at a time, while another time (my first attack) it landed me in the ER for pain/vomiting then disappeared for years. 

I have a high pain tolerance too, gallstones are generally regarded as very painful. Something severely painful that comes and goes like that is ideal I think, plus for gallstones the only real treatment is surgery, so you can say you can't afford it or whatever."
