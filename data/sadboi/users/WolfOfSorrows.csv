I don't feel like that should be seen at the same level. Sure, if the person does it to such an extent that it's dehumanizing or degrading, sure, but negative criticism is just letting people know you have a problem with something. It's not abuse if your mother criticizes the amount of work you put toward school, as an example. It is if she calls you stupid.
  
I also think we as BPD need to be careful when evaluating abuse. Some things done to us feel like the worst sort of treatment in the world, but don't actually rise to the level of abuse. Our perceptions are inherently biased and recounting what happened doesn't necessarily help either (since the event is still being filtered through the same lens of our own perception).

Even then, I'd be cautious. I mean, someone would generally not go to a professional for ADHD (though perhaps they should more often?) but if you alter your life choices based around that presumption you might worsen things. Let's say you think you are ADHD and then it turns out that you're dealing with, say, anxiety instead - you might become even more anxious if the improvement you anticipate doesn't happen. Professionals know not only the potential causes but also the ways (due to both schooling and experience) to disconfirm whether a given potential cause isn't likely in a given case and the potential consequences of a misdiagnosis. They're not perfect, but no one is and it's the best option.  
  
> an objective friend
  
There is no such thing. I mean, admittedly there's no such thing as an objective anything, cognitive biases being uniformly pervasive, but friends still will have more baggage that they bring to the party than trained professionals.  I'd still lean in favor of the new psych working with the DSM as a starting point (and if it isn't just a starting point to them, you should be finding a new psych if you can anyways). You may think you know where you are, but they need to define that independently using their own observations (because projecting false symptoms is, in and of itself, a symptom in some cases).
  
And yes, I'm sorry I didn't make that clear, but monitoring your symptoms and asking your doctor, ""Is it X?"" is absolutely in-bounds. Forcing ""It IS X!"" on them is not, of course, but I m not saying that's what you're presenting. Self-reporting your suspicions about yourself is vital to having an open conversation with your mental professionals.  
  
Finally, remember that this is the BPD area - one of our problems is that we can overestimate our abilities or overpromise our capabilities sometimes. Self-diagnosis feeds into that. Asking us to not self-diagnose is like asking an alcoholic not to drink - we sometimes get carried away (as I did when I thought I was DID just because someone who I liked was)."

If you are living on the streets, you need to figure out your strategy for getting off the streets. Now, I'm lucky - I live in California and there are tons of resources out here for that. You may live in a place that's less fortunate. Still, there's likely to be something - and you have Internet access, so you have the ability to look up what resources are around. A lot of homeless resources also focus on mental health, and you should take advantage of that.
  
I desperately want people to give a shit about me, too, but everyone's got their own shit they have to focus on. Right now everyone's fighting off some sort of malaise.

Second, paragraphs *really* help the legibility of a post. This is a little harder to read and you might get more feedback if you were to break it up.  
  
Third, is your mother your therapist or are you going to a separate therapist? I really hope it is the second, as the first would be unethical. Your mother has to remain your mother and, while she needs to be aware of the effects that borderline can have on someone, she also need to be careful about diagnosing you in media res. This probably deserves a full session with your actual therapist, learning how to tell your mother that some things are BPD, yes, and some things are just personality or beliefs.  
   
Fourth - are you getting enough sleep and eating right? Since you're wearing down at the end of the day, it could be that you just need a little more sleep or a better diet.

> I’m starting to connect all the pieces and realize she’s my FP because I feel absolutely so territorial over her, I’m jealous and overprotective  
  
It happens. There's a woman in Colorado who I'm strongly attached to emotionally who does not want a relationship with me (I think - she is bad at communication.) The idea of her being sexual active with someone else is a dagger in my heart, and this is compounded by her fundamental difference of opinion in how she regards sexuality, with only penetration actually counting as sex to her (so she can say that she's not getting any but may have engaged in hand stuff ad gah...). So...yeah, I get how the idea of sexual behavior with another can feel very hurtful.  
  
Our feelings are valid. There is nothing wrong with how we feel. It just is.  
  
What we do about our feelings is what is important in terms of functioning properly in society. This is where we have to be mindful. Be slow in how we react, don't let your emotions spill over too much, respect the boundaries of the other person.  
  
> but since I think I have quiet borderline I hold all of that in.  
  
Think? If you have not been diagnosed you need to get to a mental health professional and have them evaluate you. Self-diagnosis is very unwise and can be dangerous.  
  
> I was able to get drunk both times so I did  
  
I know it's tough, but you may want to avoid the liquor as much as possible. You may be a prime candidate for substance abuse issues and the best way not to have those is to not go down that road. Don't self-medicate with alcohol, even if you don't think that's what you're doing.  

> told her that literally the only things stopping me from killing myself are her and my mom
  
This is a lot to put on someone. Do you feel it to be true? If so, this may be something that it would help for you to work on. You can't ask your friend to carry you fully like this, and there ARE other reasons out there for living.
  
> But whenever someone references us dating she gets slightly upset but I find it funny  
  
This may be a sign of something. Perhaps she has already picked up on some of your dependent qualities and it makes her uncomfortable. It might be worth having a mindful, calm, talk where you can do your best to not split in response to her actions.  
  
You're not a bad person. Keep that in mind. You do have several things to work on. We all do. Do what you can with mindfulness and care and forgiveness and you can succeed. But get yourself to that mental health professional ASAP - you mentioned being on antidepressants so you sound like you have a road open to you, and if that's not a good road you can also look into whatever mental health options are available at college."

Those are magic words for BPD folks. That's another term for [splitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_(psychology\)). If someone is perceiving your reactions in that light, then it means that there are steps you can take to approach the situation better than you are.  
  
First off, try to maintain mindfulness about your situation. It's not all or nothing. It doesn't have to be perfection or nothing at all. Just keep learning and progressing until you get to the end. If you stumble, rectify the situation and forgive yourself.

If you think someone is awful, look for their positives. Remember that disconfirming awesome doesn't make them awful and disconfirming awful doesn't make them awesome.

That important detail aside...We BPD folks move fast as compared to other people and impart devotion at a rate that other folks don't. He may not be ready for that.

It's easy to judge based on impulse. Take a step back and look at him while trying to disconfirm your gut feelings about him. It's difficult but doing so might help you understand his future compatibility with you.  
  
I will say that his comment about ""now he cannot have female friends"" is not a great thing. It does diminish your justifiable concerns about monogamy, and that doesn't inspire a ton of trust.

If you have a friend who you trust well and who knows your disorder, use them to vet the big things. They can be a good pressure valve.  
  
Using tools to mitigate against potential confirmation bias can also be important. Instead of finding evidence to confirm what you believe, look at evidence to disprove what you're leaning towards. For example, if you feel like someone doesn't like you, look for evidence that demonstrates that they do like you.
  
Be careful not to get into a spiral. It's OK to feel, but it's how we act on those feelings which defines if we're functional. Forgive yourself if something goes wrong and take a breath if you feel a little too obsessive.
