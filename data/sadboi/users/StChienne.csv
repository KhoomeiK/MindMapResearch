Anything but a dress is simply too hot to wear, and 100+ temperatures will be the daily norm for six months or more.

Most of my dresses are long, either midi or maxi. A great pair of shoes and I’m done, looking put together and professional.

Unless you’re getting your shoes custom-made, you have to find who’s making a close approximation of your foot.

femalefashionadvice,fj4ptpd,t3_fbh5ye,1583013998.0,"Two years ago, I bought a fabulous pair of silk Robert Rodriguez pants at Nordstrom‘s, on clearance, during their promotional dollar days, with a credit on my account.... which is the long way of saying they were under 50 bucks and the most amazing pair of pants ever.
I needed them shortened, and the sales associate said it would be complementary, she would walk me right back to the seamstress, no waiting.
Taylor seem to know what she was doing, made some chalk marks, put in some pins, and told me to come back at the end of the week to pick them uP.
They destroyed the pants. First, whoever did the hems didn’t use a silk needle. So each stitch looked like it had put in by chewing Wolverines...
There were a bunches at the side seems... and to top it all off the legs were not the same length.
At first the seamstresses said well, what can you expect with silk?
I demanded a manager, and she never made eye contact with me after seeing the pants. She said she would find another pair in my size at another store. Fat chance!!!
She went and got the store manager, the store manager assured me they would do their best to replace the pants and someone would call me within 48 hours. Two days later the manager called sorry to tell me that there were no more silk Rodriguez pants to be had anywhere in the chain. Sadly, all manager could offer was to credit my account for the ruined pants.
Suffice to say I have not shopped at Nordstrom’s since... once upon a time, they had the best customer service in the retail world. The Horton Plaza store made shopping such a pleasure... those days are gone."

When he proposed, five years ago, I said yes, as long as he could guarantee sex twice a week in any way at all. He agreed and we said I do. Today he tells me that was a lie, he just really wanted us to get married. That he never, ever wanted sex more than once a month. I’ve always been a once-a-day gal.
We haven’t had sex at all this year, and only had sex four times last year. He just got a cancer diagnosis, so things will certainly not improve anytime soon. I either need to leave or find a lover."
