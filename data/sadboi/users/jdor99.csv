They remind me of douchey 14 year olds who live in they’re ego and think they’re awesome and super cool and agree with all the dumb shit he says. Just so retarded. They aren’t real anymore. I’m not sure they ever were. I can’t watch tfak anymore and jre is going the same way.

Keto I did for 4 months, and hardcore. It just put me in a terrible mood and I lost weight. Such high fat didn’t work. It took me months to recover mood wise. I tried carnivore and that was the best diet I’ve done. Energy was level, sex drive very high, mood pretty good. It’s hard to maintain so I just now try and eat a lot of meat and not eat too much bad stuff. Works ok. I also notice if my carbs are low then I feel alcohol a lot more. However to answer question, yes, carbs do have a negative effect on my mood."

TherapeuticKetamine,fi8bcpp,t3_f6vtnl,1582236976.0,I smoked weed before from infusions 1-4. Then I didn’t for 5-6. I don’t know which is better long term but I felt without weed I would feel a lot more emotions. Weed kinda numbed the bad or deep emotions and made me feel really good. I really have no idea which is better overall.
TherapeuticKetamine,fi2s7ct,t3_f63l3o,1582087572.0,I had to push my provider hard to bump me up to 65mg. They said that was their max limit. I think I might have to find a new doc. 65 was ok but I could easily go to 75. It’s kinda disappointing. But I think if I started at 100 it would have been too much.

depressionregimens,f8feyti,t1_f8eidcp,1574542543.0,I agree. I think often it’s born of some trauma or persistent stress. Particularly when we are younger and it throws the system off. The body just can’t easily feel safe. I’m sure some other people’s experiences don’t dovetail with this but I’m sure a lot do also.

I’m now trying 125mg a day and things seem more normal. I’ll see how that goes and increase overtime depending on how things go.
