BPD,etsdkv1,t3_cd8vah,1563142826.0,"For me, there seems to be some weak correlation between how strong an emotion, or desire to act, is, and the simultaneous feeling that it may not be authentic.

But, then I think about how all emotion (in all humans) is meant to affect the behavior of the feeler. This behavioral effect is visible to others, affecting how they perceive and act toward the feeler.

In that sense, you could say that all emotion is designed, at least in part, to affect (manipulate?) those who you interact with.

I think the BPD brain is just more inclined to resort to extreme emotions, and behavior, than the typical human brain. The BPD brain also seems to sometimes let our conscious mind in on those true, secret intentions. This, of course, just adds to the sense of madness."

BPD,etqq1uq,t3_ccy7ve,1563097237.0,"You are not bad. I can relate to all of this. Here's how I've come to deal with feeling that I am bad. Stay with me. 

EVERYONE IS BAD.

Look at experiments like the Stanford Prison Experiment. You put people in positions of power, or weakness, and they change. They reveal that they can be ""bad"". The new environment didn't create the potential for bad behavior, it was always there. It is in all of us.

We (BPDers) have all been through something that has affected us forever. Not our fault. All we can do is do our best to be who we want to be.

There is no bad. There is just you acting how you'd like to, or not. Everyone does things they regret. It's just harder for us. 

At some point, I started using my devaluing instincts against the voices in my head that call me immoral. I'm literally just realizing this as I write it, but this is probably why I COMPLETELY LOSE MY SHIT when I witness, or think about, people forcing their morals on others. FUCK THEM! No one knows what is truly right or best. 

Ok, this became more cathartic for me than I expected. 

It's extremely hard sometimes, but don't let the past drag you down. You are not stained or hopeless. Every moment is a chance to be who you want to be."

BPD,etqor64,t3_ccyr8v,1563095263.0,"Maybe ask him: if you could take a break from yourself, would you?

BPD is exhausting for the symptomatic person, but also those around them. People need to re-charge.

Even pairs of perfectly healthy people need time apart. 

I'd be surprised if this didn't make sense to him.



Also, I think asking him the goal-clarifying questions is great, but if you didn't already, you might tell him what you want the answers to be.

Sometimes I feel no conviction about anything, unless my FP/SO makes it clear how much it means to her."

On paper, I think most people would consider me (very?) successful. Looking back on my life, 50%+ of it still feels like a nightmare. Other parts are great though.

It's a constant struggle to see this as it is (rather than emphasizing only positive or negative) and appreciate what I've got and continue to do my best.

&#x200B;

Is it possible for the two of you to get away (even just for a day) in an environment where you can be reasonably sure you'll be in a good state / not triggered? Maybe that would break up the bad streak?

BPD,etm8hft,t1_etlkud5,1562954338.0,"I can relate to almost everything I read in this sub. I think my negative impulses are maybe a little weaker than the typical BPD person and so I don't act on them as much. As a result, I don't experience all the consequences you see here.

&#x200B;

I'm pretty obsessed with my FP/SO, but it doesn't really cause any problems. I don't have the fear of abandonment. I was less secure about relationships in high school. I felt like if I wasn't with my friends, they were somewhere having fun without me, on purpose.

&#x200B;

I think the biggest affect bpd had on me with respect to relationships has to do with my fear of rejection. Unless very drunk, I could never approach a woman who I wasn't 100% confident wouldn't reject me. I've only dated women that threw themselves at me, more or less. Then, I would stay in the relationship as long as possible because I was afraid to be alone.

I did speak with my psychiatrist asap, and he agreed that I at least exhibit many of the traits, stopping short of whether or not I have full-blown BPD.

I'm not so much concerned about the exact labels. I'm much more satisfied and encouraged by having, what feels like, a much more complete and useful picture of myself.
