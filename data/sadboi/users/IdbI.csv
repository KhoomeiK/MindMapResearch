The way platforms usually decrease volume is that they take the loudest part of the track and decrease that to the wanted decibel. So if ur track has loud peaks, youtube is going to decrease ur whole track volume unneccessary amount so the peak volume is going to match their standards. Key is to make ur whole track equal in volume."

rap,fi8ak8f,t1_fi7xnvk,1582236531.0,"yea true but I think its better that white teens vibe with the music than them being against or even indefferent about it because the popularity rap has achieved has probably made lots of kids less racist, more sociable and less depressed because some of them have learned good ideologies from the music like the bro and ""team"" mentalities. And I think its generally good to find out and research other cultures and their ways of living and combine them with own. It connects people and makes them more tolerant. And some of the problems rapped about are same that white teens are experiencing. Of course there are bad mentalities that can be also learned in the process like idolizing guns and sexism in rap culture but I think it comes down to the individuals own moral judgement. Young people can easily embrace some of the bad mentalities but as they grow older, their moral judgement evolves and I hope many people learn to look through it. Some people listen to rap just because its popular and their friends listen to it and I dont think that is something to be blamed about. Plus its just music and people dig the hard hitting 808, punching snares and agressive lyrics because of the way it sounds."
rap,fi7jkq4,t1_fi79sff,1582222609.0,"Problem here is the fact that he gained success with this kind of music but that says more about the society than pop smoke himself. For example black metal music and their extreme lyrics. They are expressing hatred because they dont fit in the society, and people fuck with the music because they feel the same emotions and need to express themselves through the music. These artists can be judged from their toxic ideologies but I dont think that music should be silenced because if that is how they feel, allow them to make music out of it and if people like it allow them to like it because they are feeling the same emotions. Problem here is why this agressive and hatred fulfilled music is so popular. That is probably because of the hatred fulfilled history humans have. This music is a way of deconstructing history. I agree that there are better ways of criticizing the society than pop smokes music but still he reinforces the idea that the problem is still here. Movie Boyz n tha Hood depicts same kind of world than pop smokes music but the message is bit different, but the point is that these art pieces are made by people expressing their emotions on their world, being it right or wrong. I agree with you that the musics ideas should be analysed thoughtfully but if there is ever going to be a change it has to be through blaming money and power hungry constitutions, governments and people in power rather than individuals expressing themselves through art. Because if that art would be silenced or looked through, we wouldnt even think of changing how things are."
rap,fi773co,t1_fi6zcvf,1582215639.0,"Yes I would think that if rapist or gangbanger dies but what im saying is that if you listen to modern or old rap its usually about shooting guns and fucking women. Im not saying its a morally good thing but it is part of the music and the culture so it is understandable that pop smoke is rapping about the same things. I havent heard that he has actually shot somebody its just flexing and that is something almost every rapper do. Saying shit like that sounds hard and makes the song bang and that is really all there is to it. Fans like hearing that eventhough they never would do those things. The problem and causes of hood violence is bigger than just pop smoke or rap music in general so Its stupid to pinpoint anyone making music out of the situation. And as long as there is violence and guns in the world they will be idolized. I wasnt huge fan and found some of his lyrics problematic in my viewpoint, but coming out and saying that he is fucking idiot and bad person right after he dies, when u dont know him personally or what he has done, is in my opinion just attention seeking, being edgy and blaming wrong people for the problem. People connected with him through his music and have right to honor him."
rap,fi6kp7d,t1_fi54rel,1582199186.0,Trash to call him a fucking idiot considering he was rapping about his life and experiences (considering what happened sounds like pretty real shit). And its just music and entertainment so he might exaggerating to get listeners and his name in the game but that doesnt mean he was fucking idiot.
trashy,fi14ljh,t3_e62sn2,1582050510.0,that tag is much better than that shitty realistic artwork
depression,fh9ewk6,t3_enrs4c,1581379702.0,I know exactly how u feel. I feel like explaining how I feel to someone puts too much emphasis on myself so I rather not.
