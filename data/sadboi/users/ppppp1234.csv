And on the average now, from total world wide population(world population now is 7.8billions). around 0.03% of people are infected and remember, most of them are recovered.

And.. IMHO, poverty, crime and famine that would come after of all this in a lot of poorer countries will be much much worst and it would take a long time to recover. 
...I’m so sorry it is a long reply but sometimes I feel like the mainstream media are way overhype about this, a lot of panic and anxiety to make people scared. They won’t shut down the whole world for people in poverty and poor people because they can’t make money out of them, like they would when this vaccines for the virus comes out.

You can non rev with Emirates and connect with Flydubai. There is ID50 which it is confirmed seats but limited seats on a flight so gotta plan early.
