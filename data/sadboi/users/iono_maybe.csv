LifeProTips,foz0ozx,t3_ga6fyf,1588182658.0,"I learned from speech competitions that it’s ok to silently contemplate what you’d like to say in response for a second or two. After our speeches the judges would ask questions about the topic we discussed. And some people would just start talking kinds of gibberish, eg “um, well”. And they’d lose points for it. 

It’s better to pause for those seconds and think about your answer. And remember! In a job interview, you’re interviewing them just as much as they are interviewing you. Make sure that the job and workplace will be a place at which you’ll enjoy spending 40 hours a week."

AskRedditAfterDark,fol2fjl,t3_g80ey6,1587853557.0,"I think talking to exes is a tricky topic. Now, firstly you’ve expressed to her how it is hurtful that she is looking to someone else for emotional support (that’s what friends are for) with a person with whom she has had romantic feelings. She, in turn, expressed that she would like to continue contact with this person, knowing that it is hurtful to you. The question I pose for her is: what do you receive from this interaction that you can not find in a different friend or your partner?

I think the worst fear on your part (and correct me if I’m wrong) is that her talking to this person will ultimately result in her cheating and/or ending your marriage. Express to her how bad that thought of losing her feels. I’m sure she wouldn’t like if she had that same fear from something you were doing. 

But the most important thing is to openly discuss is what she gets out of talking to this ex. Make sure she is in a safe space to share her feelings. Now, it might be that he’s flirty or charming. And she may like feeling desirable. And that’s ok. It’s not inherently wrong to enjoy feeling desirable. However, if that is the case you both need to work together to figure out how to fulfill each other’s emotional needs. 

Now if the benefits of this relationship with an ex is more mundane, like they swap recipes or talk about college friends they shared, then it is up to you to acknowledge your own insecurities (and we ALL have insecurities) and how they are not rooted in reality. If she and him are sharing pictures of cats, then it doesn’t make sense to be jealous, right? 

I feel for you guys. It is a complicated situation. If you ever wanna talk about it, feel free to message me. I’ve gone through similar problems with my fiancé. And we worked through it! Made us even stronger."

depression,fnwmbq8,t1_fnvl7sg,1587321122.0,"I guess the best way I can put it is risk vs reward. So if you call they either A) don’t answer or B) enjoying talking to you. Now if you never call at all, you get the same A result. But if you reach out, there’s a chance that B will happen. So you’re giving yourself a chance. 

And as far as being a bother to someone, i think that having that expectation shows a lot of your our insecurities. I get it. I would worry about that too. “Should I leave them alone? I don’t wanna dump all my depressed bs on them. Then I’ll just be a burden.” “Are they mad at me? They didn’t text me back...” “are they just my friend out of pity?” None of those thoughts are true. People don’t really stay friends out of pity. That would incredibly emotionally draining. 

But something I’ve had to accept is that there are a million different types of friendships. Some are extremely close, and some are more casual. But all of them have value and are legitimate.

I guess what I want you to remember is that you have value. And someone else not seeing your value, doesn’t lessen it. So if it turns out that they don’t wanna be your friend, that’s ok. You want people in your life that see and celebrate your value."

But he was right. The fear of rejection or being seen as too needy made me self-isolate. 

So now if I wanna reach out to someone, I do. I’ve messaged people on Instagram or FB just saying “hey! I’m thinking of you and wishing you well!” Or even randomly texted people that I haven’t spoken to in a while because something reminds me of them. 

So, yes the phone works both ways. But if you wanna call, then call! Don’t worry about when the last time you spoke, or when’s the last time they called you. Go for it!"

But I knew that even though that night was overall a good experience, that I was playing with fire. I had gained so much from my sobriety and I'm blessed enough that I didn't lose all that I gained from one night off the wagon. But when I woke up the next morning and had a hangover, I was immediately reminded of the countless mornings I had woken up feeling even worse with much more regret. In that lapse, I saw the good.

I did go cold turkey. So the first day w/o booze: not bad. Second day w/o booze: shaky, tired with insomnia, hungry with no appetite. You just feel like shit.

Also, don’t feel like you need to drink once a week to hang out with your friends. For me, when I first wanted to quit drinking, the idea of never drinking again seemed impossible and TBH lame. I literally didn’t know what a social outing could look like if I wasn’t drinking. And then I got sober. And I remember after a month of sobriety I went out to a bar to sing karaoke with my friends. It was the first time I was gonna test my resolve to stay sober, and my friends were supportive and were ready to leave if I needed to. But I chose a song and got on stage. I was shaking so much. I forgot that although I sang at karaoke many times, all of those times had booze as a close companion. And as the night progressed, my friends’ eyes got a little glassy from the alcohol. Their faces got rosy. Words became slurred. And I realized that I didn’t want to be where they were. I was having a blast while sober. 

If you want to drink occasionally, then go for it. But be honest with yourself. Will drinking one day lead to drinking EVERY day? Because I’m here to tell you sobriety is actually dope as hell. I legit have more fun now than I ever did drunk because I remember everything and don’t embarrass myself (unless I want to of course). 

I WISH I would have gotten sober sooner. But I know it’s hard when your younger because society says “well that’s just what you do at that age!” But blacking out 3-4 nights a week should have never been passed off as “normal” just because I was in college/high school.

Now as far as how to socialize sober, that is something that you will discover over time. For a long time, all social situations are partnered with getting wasted. You’ll have to slowly learn what human connection really means. It’s an amazing experience, not a scary one. Anyone that really cherishes your company will make plans with you that do not involve alcohol. You can go to the zoo, parks, fairs, museums, plays, movies, shopping, pottery classes, the list goes on! 

I remember when I first got sober I literally couldn’t think of a single activity that didn’t involve drinking. But that was just because I lived my life as an alcoholic so long, that every activity for me was centered around drinking. People who don’t have a problem don’t center their whole day around when they can get their next drink so I kinda followed their lead.

And for most of the people you mentioned, I had no idea they were sober too! #teamsober"

TooAfraidToAsk,f1m8yed,t3_d9xhzu,1569587954.0,"Most of my memories are like vignettes. A few key movements or still images and then a feeling associated with them. 

But some memories that I really really want to remember, I’ll remember kinda like you. For example, when I was 6 I wanted to remember that I loved my teacher and that she was my all time favorite. So I can’t remember why she was my favorite teacher, and I’ve forgotten the feelings I had for her. But I remember that I told myself to remind future me that she was the best teacher ever. I do this for a few things that I don’t want to forget from time to time."

stopdrinking,f0ttgye,t1_f0rl28k,1568928651.0,"Lol well we’re all super close and pretty young. Plus we work in the service industry so being up all night is really just like another work day. But it was just a bunch of 20-30 year old chicks enjoying the water, so who cares!"
stopdrinking,f0tqytl,t1_f0sh978,1568927309.0,"That’s the thing about my experience. It was only positive, because it was a one time slip. And that’s tempting. Why NOT have that again? But the truth is that if I welcome such nights into my regular routine they will quickly degrade into blackouts, bad behavior, endangering myself and others, losing my phone/keys/wallet so often that I stop bringing them out, keeping my fiancé up all night worrying about if I’ll even make it home, and then the constant anxiety, regret, embarrassment, and stress that my behavior while drinking brings. 

What I took away from this experience, was that even though is was positive, I still don’t want to drink. That mild hangover was just a whisper of the deafening scream that my alcoholism brings. And feeling it, woke me up. It made me realize that I love my life and I don’t need booze in it. It will get as bad as before. I might take time, but I know I would get there. So after I fell of the wagon, I had to choose to get back on or stay on the path of drunken stupors. And I gladly choose to get back on. Because I’m lucky that it didn’t go south. I’m lucky that I have a fiancé that is forgiving. I’m lucky that I had friends that were there to keep me safe. And I’m lucky that I was able to slip and not completely lose everything I’ve gained. I am so blessed to be where I am. I have to forgive myself for cheating and continue to move forward."
stopdrinking,f0tpq9b,t1_f0sddcx,1568926654.0,"I agree that my badge should be reset because it does feel dishonest. Especially when it is hard work to stay 100% sober. I guess what I mean to say is that, when I look back years down the line I’ll remember that in the first year of me really starting a sober journey, I slipped. So even my own head, if I were to count down the days in the future I would use that day (the one that just happened) as my last day drinking. Because that’s the truth. And that kinda feels better for me. 

I’ve gained so much in the last year, that I’m not gonna let one night take all of that away. And that’s what I want to get across. One slip doesn’t have to be the end of the world. I cheated. I did something I knew I wasn’t supposed to be doing. I accept responsibility for that. And I want a new badge to reflect that change. I feel like because of that slip, I have an even clearer picture of what I want for my future. And that is sobriety."
stopdrinking,f0tos90,t1_f0t8nc7,1568926157.0,"I agree. It could definitely be triggering. And you’re right. I did break it. So let’s reset that badge, add a trigger warning, and keep on learning and growing as sobernauts."
stopdrinking,f0r1kv9,t1_f0qzyuo,1568871592.0,"And I don’t recommend doin what I did. It was dangerous. It could have easily led to a full relapse. Shit. I don’t know the future. Maybe that night gets replayed in my head and the temptation gets too great. I don’t want my experience to give you the impression that it’s a good idea to test your own limits. But learn from it, sure. What I learned is that booze doesn’t add much to my life."
stopdrinking,f0r0tf2,t1_f0qzyuo,1568871020.0,"I feel like it doesn’t affect my sobriety time because I did it consciously. And I still want to continue my sober journey. Like I didn’t just go on a bender without care. I was very aware that I was testing my limits. 

And yea, I drank more than one because I was drinking with friends. Kinda just holding a beer and when they would order another I would get one too. But it did feel nice to say “grab me one too!” When people would step inside to grab another. It felt nice to be included. But I realize that I was included anyway. Me feeling excluded only came from me and my insecurities. My friends just wanna hang out with me whether I drink or not."
stopdrinking,f0qz0ec,t1_f0qumy1,1568869747.0,"Exactly. I knew I was playing a dangerous game. But curiosity got the best of me. And I’m glad it did. Because I realize that all the fun I had that night wasn’t because of booze. Adding it into the mix didn’t add much, except a nasty hangover. 

So that was a one time experiment that I don’t feel the need to repeat. But I’m glad I did it. It just puts everything into perspective. I don’t wanna give up everything I’ve gained just to have a hangover and regret."
stopdrinking,f0qyeyi,t1_f0qxpn9,1568869331.0,"I was conscious of how much and how fast I drank. So I was holding myself back. Focusing more and the people I was with. And THAT was what made it fun. My friends were what made me happy. The booze, meh. That just gave me a hangover.

And I hear ya. The fun from that night can be tempting. Maybe in the future, I’ll tell myself “well you did it once!” But I realizing I was playing with fire. 

When I got home at 6am my fiancé told me that even though I was out all night he wasn’t worried about my safety. Now albeit that’s because he didn’t know I was drinking but what it really means is that I’ve built his trust in me again. And I don’t want to lose that. 

I guess what I really learned is sure, I CAN drink, but do I want to? Do I want to go back to where I was? Do I want to welcome all the negative just for a super small amount of positive? In that sense, it’s an easy choice. And it feels more like a choice now. I was scared of alcohol. Scared of myself if I drank. Now I’m not scared. I know I COULD go down that road. But I don’t want to give up everything I’ve gained."

Feminism,ezl4uhf,t1_ezl2dj0,1567972022.0,"I like your analogy. It’s more about that person’s experiences with women in the past. If they’ve had many women in their life behave a certain way, a woman behaving differently wouldn’t “be like other girls” to them. And that could be for better or worse. 

I constantly hear that I’m “not like other girls” from both men and women. I think that just shows that I’m open about my uniqueness more so than others. 

I can see the sentiment from the original post, and I can agree that there are men that think little of women in general but that you might be “one of the good ones.” Now that is not a good thing because that shows their prejudices against women. But not all people would use that statement as a reflection on their anti-feminist opinions."
stopdrinking,ezajaak,t3_d0gafb,1567802539.0,I hear that little voice too sometimes. I just remember something my aunt told me: “You’re not saying ‘yes’ to one drink; you’re saying ‘yes’ to relapsing.”  So when I hear that little voice saying “just one wouldn’t hurt” I remember that that voice is a liar. Because one will always lead to another and another.

lgbt,ez8iqzl,t1_ez8ib9a,1567744732.0,"Also I’m mocking the audacity of someone saying something that is suppose to make me change my mind about my relationship. Imagine someone saying “wow, your partner is [blank]. You should break up with them.” Sure. I’ll get right on that. Since you clearly know all the ins and outs of our relationship, you’re more than qualified to make that call."
lgbt,ez8ilun,t1_ez8ib9a,1567744597.0,"But still. They meant that being gay would be an insult. That person isn’t calmly saying “oh you’re dating a trans person so you’re gay” as a statement, which would just a dumb thing to say. They not only are being offensive to trans people, they are also being homophobic. 

And honestly I hate the words trans/homophobic. You aren’t scared. You’re just an ignorant, mean spirited asshole."
lgbt,ez7v7iq,t3_d04362,1567728816.0,Oh noooo. Because being gay would be so horrible. You’re right. I’ll fall out of love with that person straight away. *eye roll*
lgbt,eyy1he3,t3_cza8dz,1567568366.0,"I think that it's a very immature response for sure. I would never care about my roommate's sexuality. I don't really care about anyone's sexuality unless I'm trying to get in their pants, in which case I would like to know if they like my flavor of ice cream. 

I just think that maybe the person in question hasn't had any real life exposure to the gay community. Because if they had, they would know that it changes nothing. Maybe he thinks his house is gonna turn into a gay bar with lady gaga playing all night and tons of glitter. Just hope that this person learns from this experience. Maybe he lives with this person and realizes that gay people are just like everybody else."
