I became enamored with alliterative verse after doing my senior thesis on Piers Plowman and reading some other Middle English poetry (specifically the Pearl / Gawain poet) Long story short every line has four stressed syllables, three of which alliterate.

OCPoetry,fl6dvl7,t3_fmsms8,1584864390.0,"I love the feelings this poem speaks to, that feeling of knowing you’re not actually helping yourself but this is where you’re comfortable.

Some ways to improve this would be to up the plain spoken violent nature of the self harm.  This is not a “pretty poem” so I would find the really flowery language and strip it down.“Crimson rivulets” can just be “blood” for example.  Gets to the heart of the matter.  
Or the “oh, how I wish” could just be “I wish”.  

Lastly “I may look normal” can probably go.  First, it gives off an edgy high school vibe, and second, there’s no surprise because we know the speaker self harms already.  

I think there’s potential if you opened this poem up to not just the ways the speaker self harms, but how they feel coming back to it time and time again. 

Keep writing and sharpening up this poem, there’s something great there."
OCPoetry,fl6cvoz,t3_fmuoab,1584863172.0,"There’s a lot of really great stuff going on here.  The first section is in my opinion the strongest. While there is a point to opening up strongly, the absolute best lines in the poem are “she believes in cherry blossoms like her lover believed in cemeteries”  I love these lines; they’re so beautiful, which just makes everything else feel a bit weaker.  It could honestly end right there.  

I would love it if the imagery was a mixture of erotic and violent, or the imagery was violent. because those two themes seem linked in this piece.  “Sunlight bled through the leaves” “crushed rinds of fruit” “blood pours from meat”, that kinda stuff. 

My last criticism is that the poem loses me in the final section.  I can tell it’s about innocence and wishing to be a child (if I read it right, but I’m very dense so who knows?) but it’s phrased in a spiritual sort of way I don’t personally like too much, what with all the talk of the woman in the womb.  That’s probably just me though.

Keep up though you clearly have a keen eye for brilliant lines."
