OkCupid,fivt8kj,t3_f9uuzp,1582767540.0,"Dude I am a women and I am fat as fuck. (Like 400lbs. I am down 30lbs from dieting and exercise)( and currently still working on it ) however I never hid that on my profile. Like people should never hide that. That is such an important part of attraction. If they don’t like you for your weight they are not the one for you. 


Like I get it that some people like fat ppl are gross. That’s ok cux you know we all like something different. However if you don’t like someone because of  blah blah . Just move on there is no need to make rude comments. Just be nice it takes a lot to put them self out there"
OkCupid,filngf5,t3_f8h1ee,1582505757.0,find ways to make your self cool without lying. Also being funny always works. Also dogs in photos is a nice touch
OkCupid,fiixpuq,t3_f81eob,1582429565.0,I just think that it’s all about who is on the app and when. I think it can be just has hard if you match with everyone as well as no one.
