I can say that she probably is stressed about answering all social media. She might have started with you bc she was just lonely and loved how you loved her.

It was a busy time so we could not really go out during that. A few weeks later I asked if we could hang out again. He said yeah we totally should, so I came up with some things we could do en when, but he was always too busy. I thought it can happen. 

But then he stopped putting in effort and it was always me texting him. He stopped responding to some of it, sometimes he gives me a short answer. So I gave him multiple breaks. But he still does not text first. 

I told him I wasn't noticing efforts from his side. He responded with I actually still want to date, it is just the timing I am busy.

So I am going tp wait until after the break.

So far he only snapped me for streaks(past 2 weeks).

I was really neglected by my mentally abusive ex so this kind of hurts and I was really honest with him about it without pressuring him or making him feel bad."
