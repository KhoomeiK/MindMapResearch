SDSU,fqfnmw2,t3_gilzqe,1589328181.0,"MIS major here. Not really - I had a pretty easy time getting classes after transfer orientation. You may find that the professors with the better ratings, or more convenient class times, are already waitlisted. But you’ll be able to get classes for sure!"
SDSU,fqfls4w,t1_fqf7m91,1589327199.0,I feel you. It took me almost 7 years (with breaks in between) to finish classes at CC and transfer. I especially feel for the younger incoming freshman/transfers... and those who have graduated/ are due to graduate. I’m sorry.
SDSU,fnjhojr,t3_g1wd6t,1586999177.0,They just sent out a school wide email confirming this
SDSU,fndv7dw,t1_fnalulv,1586878105.0,"That logic makes sense. In regards to transitioning from online to in person rather than vice versa. 
Hoping they make a definitive decision by the end of spring. My lease ends in the July, and I don’t want to renew my lease if it’s unnecessary. Plus it’s just a potential for me to save a ton of money if I don’t have to. I’m sure some others are in the same boat!"
mentalhealth,fn2aiwu,t3_fyfxes,1586582581.0,What a great post! And what a great feeling to have. I'm glad that you are able to experience this after you have been through much darker times. I hope that you continue on this journey on making peace with yourself OP. <3
SDSU,fmnppx6,t3_fwa0m7,1586231905.0,"I’m sorry OP, that is super rough and so stressful. I would contact the financial aid office and see what your options are. I’m sure that someone there can lead you in the right direction. This is a weird time we are in. 

Also, if you haven’t, apply for FAFSA (fafsa.gov is the website). You have until May 1st. You may not get a lot, since I’m assuming you’re a dependent and enrollment begins every October 1st, but you should get something at least. 

Good luck and congrats on your admission!"
relationship_advice,fmcn3vb,t3_fubn0u,1585948867.0,"To be frank with you, this dude sounds like a manipulative asshole who is using tactics to control you by ruining your self esteem. Making you believe some lies about your body and showing you pictures of other women? Who the fuck does he think he is. 

Dump his toxic ass. Nobody deserves to be treated to or talked to in that way. There are a ton of other healthy men out there who will never do this to you. Please leave him and do not talk to him."
SDSU,fma3gz6,t3_ftw0al,1585882881.0,"I’m hoping it becomes an optional option. I always shoot for high marks, but this semester has just become a wash. I’m doing the bare minimum to scrape by and keep my sanity. 
So, hopefully we can opt into this if we want to. And those who want a letter grade can be allowed to keep the current grading standards."
politics,flcmy8y,t3_fnwju9,1585037511.0,Honestly f*ck this guy. I’m so tired of his blatant BS and the fact that people still support this moron.
SDSU,flcizsn,t3_fnwvb9,1585032726.0,"Yeah, it’s been rough, and you definitely aren’t alone. I switch back and forth from wanting to try, to not caring at all. I’ve been trying to ride out those positive waves when they come. 

The news and current events don’t help in the slightest. It’s a weird, strange, awful time, but take comfort in knowing you aren’t alone. And I think we are going to come out on the other side... whatever and wherever that may be. Here for you OP, keep your chin up."
SDSU,fkdexzj,t3_fhs0c9,1584076406.0,Lmfao this is gold
mentalhealth,fkdegt5,t3_fhmdsj,1584075959.0,"Oh hell yes. All my classes got moved to online as well, and it’s already a crazy semester just with my course workload and personal lifelong struggle with anxiety. 

I find that disengaging from social media and mainstream news helps A LOT. I’m not encouraging ignorance, but rather stepping away from the collective paranoia and negativity. It’s hard enough battling with anxiety and/or depression, and then piling on what’s going on with the world and humanity right now. 

It is immensely disheartening because a lot of people’s livelihoods and lives are at stake. But try to stay afloat. Read uplifting human interest pieces. Maybe some interesting scientific news about new discoveries. In the words of Mr. Fred Rogers, “always look for the helpers.”

I hope you have a good support group - my friends and family keep me sane. Without them, I honestly don’t know if I would make it sometimes. Still working on finding that peace within myself. 

Here for you OP, you are not alone!"
SDSU,fk6nmnv,t1_fk6mr5z,1583908271.0,I’m here for it!
SDSU,fk6kteb,t3_fgrkc7,1583905317.0,"PREACH! I agree. I started here just this past fall, and my experience has been lackluster at best. Three of my four professors last semester were clearly flustered and/or frustrated due to administrative difficulties. More of the same this semester - I also have a couple teachers who are just awful (I’m sorry but they really are). I don’t find it comforting to be amassing all this student loan debt and having all this fancy shmancy crap on campus when the faculty and students are suffering at the hands of mismanagement and terrible communication skills. I feel you OP, on everything. Thanks for posting this and speaking your mind."
SDSU,fjppeuh,t3_fdqe35,1583557282.0,"Hey don't worry you will be fine. What they're going to do is keep you in ""pre-major"" status until you take statistics. So make sure that you register for that for your first semester. Pass it with a C or better (above C-) and then you'll be officially in your major. I had to do that with Business Writing for this past fall. Good luck and congrats!"
mentalhealth,filgy0z,t3_f89un5,1582501344.0,"A lot of people don't understand what it's like to really have anxiety unfortunately (fortunately for them).
First, I would say to try to explain what it feels like, and what you need when you have an attack. In an open, honest, and receptive manner. If after you do that,  these people are still criticizing you, I would say to associate with different people. 
Also, keep in mind what your triggers are. I've gotten upset at friends in the past for giving me the cold shoulder, but then I realized I wasn't really doing anything about it. Mine is chemically induced - so too much alcohol, weed, even caffeine can set me off in a bad way. I've been abstaining completely from any substances, minus a cup of coffee in the morning. 
Sorry you're having to go through this. You aren't alone! Anxiety is awful, but it is manageable. I wish you the best of luck OP!"
mentalhealth,ficjls0,t3_f7djeu,1582349265.0,"My god I am so sorry, my heart aches for your and their loss. That is so devastating, I dont have words. A child, or anyone for that matter, should never know that much pain. I hope that wherever they may be now, they know the happiness they couldn't find here....."
SDSU,fi9l3ei,t3_f75plo,1582270071.0,"Should have been dispursed before the semester began - I think they do it about a week or two before?

First it gets applied towards tuition and school fees. If there's any left over, they will deposit it into your bank account if you set up eRefund. Otherwise you have to pick up the check from the cashiers office. 

Check Student Account Services (SAS) online to see what happened."
mentalhealth,fi6c7w1,t3_f6nn8g,1582187722.0,"You acknowledged that you have a problem and that's the first step! Be proud of yourself for that. Some people will never be able to...

Does your school offer counseling services? They should and typically an evaluation is free. Depending on your insurance, you can continue through them or they can refer you out. 

Look up local support groups. Reach out to friends and family. Have an honest conversation with your parents, if you feel like you can and they will be receptive (I am hoping so). 

The road to recovery is long and hard but it's worth it if you can keep your goals in mind and stay true to what you want to achieve. Best of luck to you OP!"
GalaxyS9,fi6a4wh,t3_f6o4fv,1582184985.0,"Same! Got it about 11:40 pm, just posted about it because I sorta tripped out... I have an unlocked Samsung A9. 

I went into the app and disabled it. Actually deleted the app in case someone was lowkey trying to hack or track me. 

Will keep following this thread for updates!"
SDSU,fi66zox,t3_f6oe9h,1582181259.0,"Yeah I had a couple of people approach me in the past weeks for ""bible study"". 
Luckily I'm non-religious, so I always immediately dismiss anything of that nature.  Stay frosty friends.  I also saw some stand thing they had in the library like a week or two ago. Dafuq."
relationship_advice,f96e69n,t3_e3z6lm,1575143753.0,"I'm sorry OP. I can empathize - it's like getting a rug ripped out from under you, and slamming you to the ground with the wind knocked out of you. 

It takes time, and sometimes it never really completely heals, but it does get easier to deal with. That I can promise. It took me about 4 years to ""get over"" my relationship with my S/O. We were together for nearly 6. But everyone is different. 

If I could give you one piece of advice I wish someone had given me way back when, it is this: do not hold on to false hope. That will drive you crazy. I used to wish and hope that he would come running back, that I would run into him and we would kiss and make up and blah blah blah...

Focus on you, and try to keep your eyes forward. Allow yourself to feel and have breakdowns and maybe go a little crazy but don't compromise your own future just because you hold onto the past. 

Best wishes to you!"
relationship_advice,f80z2cl,t3_dy2rp7,1574143060.0,"If you didn't want it, even if you didn't say ""no"", it doesn't matter. That is rape and they are both pieces of shit for forcing you to do that. 
I hope that you have someone you feel comfortable to talk to about this. I am so sorry that happened OP. Please remember this is not and never will be your fault. And please talk to someone about this, and report them if you feel ready to do that. Sending love your way <3"
