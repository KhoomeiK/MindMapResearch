NotHowDrugsWork,fpca5vi,t3_gcbxpm,1588492934.0,"LSD cannot be absorbed through the skin. Anyone who has ""done"" it was either experiencing a placebo or is a liar. 

""I've made LSD in my lab on many occasions for research purposes, possibly in not so meticulous a manner as Albert Hofmann. Nothing ever happened. I had several graduate students who made LSD as an intermediate for projects. No accidental ingestion of LSD ever occurred. A technician in my lab makes it routinely because we use it as a drug to train our rats. He's learned by experience that he never gets high, nothing ever happens. And yesterday I was talking to Nick Sand, and Nick said, ""I made a solution of LSD in DMSO…"" DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) is a chemical that greatly enhances absorption of other chemicals through the skin -- he says, ""…I painted it on my skin. Nothing happened."" A concentrated solution and nothing happened!""

""Tim Scully said, ""Did you ever get dosed through your skin in the lab"". Donnie Shackelford replied, ""No, I have accidentally dosed myself while laying sheets, I either touched my eye, or mouth. But the answer to your question is no, you cannot be dosed through the skin. I never wore gloves in any procedure unless lye is used and it isn’t in this procedure. I learned the hard way dropping a flask with 20g of LSD in it. I was extremely upset. I’ve had it all over my hands many, many times. I was there when Dr. Nichols basically called bullshit on the good doctor at Mindstates 60th anniversary"".

AdvancedRunning,fp65dv7,t1_fp5av3d,1588346381.0,"Thanks for your reply.

I pulled the insoles out and they fit almost perfectly, so I put them back in and walked around a bit and I think they will slacken up enough to become comfortable, I jumped the gun a bit. They are tight at the start of the toe box where the tongue ends, squeezes the top of my foot there, I'm wondering how tight it well get once my foot swells a bit from running. But I'm going to keep them. 

It can be so frustrating though, when I bought the Inov8's I thought it was a practical joke that someone with size 10 feet could get in them, they were about as wide as a TV remote control. My feet are wide and also tall with a very high arch. I think if I manufactured footwear I would just make them slightly wider than average, making them narrow cuts you off completely if you've got wide feet, and I doubt having a shoe that is slightly too wide causes too much of an issue if you have got narrow feet."
