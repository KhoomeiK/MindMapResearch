I think it would be good for her to have support with no agendas, but honestly you guys are young and that takes a lot of maturity. if she can‚Äôt accept a friend situation then the toxicity will get really bad and you will need to cut it off unfortunately. 

When a plane is going down, they tell you to put the mask on yourself first before helping other people. It sounds like you have your own issues to address. It‚Äôs easy to dismiss someone with a diagnosis as the problem, but ultimately it‚Äôs time for you to look inward and help yourself. This will set you up for success for your long future, trust me.

First, I figured out medication that worked for me. I also had to stop abilify as well because the side effects were horrible. Lamotrigine has really helped, and I even asked my provider to up the dose for no reason (just to try it) and I feel neurotypical, good even. 

Exercise. Amazing revelation right there. No drugs. Cut out toxic relationships & set healthy boundaries.

There is so much to be said about neurodiversity, and how each person has a lens and insight of what reality even could resemble. People are so occupied with the now and physical space- mental space is largely ignored and when you compound that with an abstraction/ distortion of mental space people are just focused on fixing you like we are robots or something.

Also want to add that I do think trauma affects how mental illness unfolds in an individual. It‚Äôs really grim, and I‚Äôm so lucky to not have had trauma or addiction so my Bp has been pretty light even though some of my delusions were traumatic.

bipolar,f9fcfio,t1_f9faqpu,1575266291.0,"This is a fantastic response and really sheds light into something I never considered before. I particularly like your parallel to dreams, and choosing which reality to recognize as the ""real"" reality. (Going to use that example for people that cannot relate otherwise...)   


I do think about ""reality"" and how dismissive it is to acknowledge only one shared reality that is deemed as valid by the status quo. This is where it gets meta, but my experiences in mania has a certain sense of personal validity in terms of vivid experience. What is reality, if lived experience does not count? I understand how that is problematic in practical terms, but in philosophical terms I really question that. 

Additionally, some of my delusions go a step beyond that and mirror some shamanistic experiences. I am curious if this is simply part of the human experience, and cultural norms affect how this is viewed in modernity.  Are some people capable of truly experiencing ""delusions"" that in fact are in tandem with a ""shared"" reality?   
It is very apparent to me that my diagnosis is an illness in the current world as we know it. But in different contexts, is it a disorder?  In other contexts of historical ""realities"", most of my delusions wouldn't have come to pass (paranoia about surveillance, governmental corruption, television delusions). I wonder what ""bipolar"" resembled in history, and if it was exhibited in similar manners. I am focusing on bp because to talk about all mental illnesses is convoluted. 

Not to ramble, I just don't have other people that ""get"" it in my personal sphere so I am crowdsourcing responses, ha."

IWantToLearn,f4lzguy,t1_f4kjaql,1571672884.0,"1. I recently got out of a long term relationship who went through the gamut with me. Kind of surprisingly we didn‚Äôt break up because of me being Bp (we definitely took breaks). Long term I think it‚Äôs sustainable to date/be in relationships if you are stable and actively practicing self care. It is possible to be in remission for years at a time, but an occasional flair up could happen. It really takes trust, communication, you being well versed in her meds if she needs immediate help, Have a safety plan of hospitals to visit etc. Maybe if you get close enough you can support her in therapy sessions. if you prepare enough in your day to day life, maybe she will trust you when you want her to go to a hospital. Sometimes the hardest part is convincing your partner they are showing signs, or are even  in a psychotic episode (even if she‚Äôs been through it before, she could still be in denial when it happens again) 

Right now I‚Äôm single & it‚Äôs really not affecting my dating life yet (but haven‚Äôt disclosed it ha- too early). Bipolar is undectable if you are grounded & not in a manic/depressive episode. This is the first time in a while I haven‚Äôt been, so to be determined... 

2. I‚Äôd like people to keep in mind (myself included) that while you live with the diagnosis, it does not define you and it does not have to dictate your future. Manic states are fleeting, and I‚Äôve know depressive episodes to pass. I‚Äôd like people to know that when they saw me out of my mind, it is a static thing that is apart from me. It absolutely is possible to recover & improve, takes a lot of effort. being Bp is also a lot more common than people might realize. It is also more dangerous than people realize. Our average life expectancy is 55 , due to the amount of bipolar people that take their own lives. I wish this awareness would bring support to the community at large, because navigating healthcare issues is outrageous in the country I live in. Pills cost 500 for 1 bottle without insurance, and 1 psych evaluation is 300. Imagine not having a job because you can‚Äôt function, then not getting the help you need because you can‚Äôt afford help, 

3. Yes. Everyone‚Äôs path is different of course, but I‚Äôm relatively young and the last decade I was institutionalized about 5 times. Combine that with about 6-8 months of depression after institutions, I pretty much have only had 5 years to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù as myself. In that time though, I graduated college, moved to a different country for a couple years, learned another language, and some other accomplishments. But I definitely have had periods where I took a shit job at a diner or motel graveyard shift because there‚Äôs nothing else I could handle while being on the strong meds I was on at the time. I think my resume sucks, is patchy with no direction, and just is shitty. Since my shitty jobs didn‚Äôt have benefits, guess what happened? Id try to function off meds, rinse repeat. 

I‚Äôm much much better now with great opportunities (thanks to networking) but I think I am rare in that regard unfortunately. There are a lot of prolific Bp people though‚Äî writers, directors, actors‚Äî in arts it actually kind of helps in a weird way. (Lots of creative fodder & energy to create when manic) 

4. Good question! One that most people feel afraid to ask. I‚Äôve had many and they are all slightly different. First one was beautiful- everything clicked, I thought I understood everything, I didn‚Äôt need to sleep or eat and had high energy. I honestly thought I reached nirvana. It turns quick though, got paranoid I had aids and swine flu... 

I will say psychotic episodes get worse every time you relapse. My last one was severe & horrific. I have some varying levels of ptsd from some of my delusions. I don‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù things or hear them necessarily, but there is just a knowing. I used to think aliens were probing  my thoughts. It‚Äôs also truman show esque. A common thing people do in episodes are risky sexual behavior, erratic spending habits, self harm, and general risky behavior. I don‚Äôt want to get into my own experience too much, but my end all be all was when I was filed as a missing person a couple years ago. I‚Äôll do anything to never have that happen again. 

It‚Äôs amazing how out of body it is. I become a stranger to myself, my thoughts are incessant, I think extremely fast. I just don‚Äôt register that it‚Äôs me and I don‚Äôt have a sense of self really. 

Things you can control & emcourage on a day to day basis: 

SLEEP ! Make sure she gets 8 hours consistently. So underrated. 

No pot.ever. 

Mindful meditation is great‚Äî look into meditation & maybe practice together. 

Exercise. 

Find the pills that work. Don‚Äôt know her situation, but anti psychotic are kind of heavy hitters. Maybe over time she can be in mood stabilizers and have anti psychs to take as needed. Definitely trust her & her doctor though. 

Best of luck to you! You are already doing  great by preparing and keeping informed. Support is a beautiful, nourishing thing and she is lucky to have found that in you. Whatever happens, I think you can reach a deeper level of intimacy with this type of trust and communication in your relationship."
