Hospitals and her delusional state being what they are meant that at one point or another I saw all her upper and lower body exposed for the first time in many years. It was so disturbing because of how she used to always parade around naked in front of me. Has hit me a few times and makes me feel so sick now. Re-traumatizing.

He told me that that pretty much gave me all the reason in the world to stop worrying about becoming an abuser. He was right. I never became an abuser. Never even considered it and am absolutely sickened by the mere thought.

I was a kid and she was my mother so it was just what it was. It was also shocking later when I read about covert incest in a once popular book on alcoholic family dynamics because the author was a friend of my mother‚Äôs and I‚Äôd known him as a kid as well. When she has refused to acknowledge it as abuse I even let her know that this friend even defined it and gave examples in one of his books that pretty much fit what she did to a T.
adultsurvivors,fqx5wyp,t1_fqx30j8,1589726521.0,"I know.

adultsurvivors,fqx1lxa,t1_fqwz2i5,1589723641.0,"Thanks. And you are right. It‚Äôs so easy for covert abusers to make you doubt yourself. It was such a shock to me when 25 years ago, I told my therapist about the things my mother did and he called it covert sexual abuse. For all those years, I‚Äôd just called it ‚Äúweird‚Äù. But when I related the details and cried (the only time ever in therapy) he called it just what it was. Got me reading and found I was not alone and finally accepted it was sexual abuse."

simpleliving,fqt9k1h,t3_gkr8yw,1589633923.0,"Sounds very familiar for my situation but with a couple twists. My mom is a hoarder. He home has been packed to the point of having only a path through most of it to walk through. She‚Äôs been unable to use her couch or recliner for nearly 20 years because they have been buried. I‚Äôve told her one of my greatest fears has long been that one day she would die and not only would have to deal with mourning and burial arrangements, etc. but it would also be left to me to deal with the literal tons of junk she would leave behind. She has claimed for years to be ‚Äúworking on it‚Äù and ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù but never with any visible change. My wife and I have offered for years to dedicate time to working with her to get the place cleaned up. She‚Äôs never taken us up on it. I‚Äôve tried to help her develop a plan to clean up. She‚Äôs never stuck to any. 

Last September, due to a combination of alcoholism and the hoarding which led her to have things stacked all the way up and down her inside stairs, she fell and broke her neck. She nearly died and had to spend several months in the hospital and then a nursing home for rehab. While she was in the hospital, we talked about the fact that her large, two floor (plus basement) duplex was no longer going to be appropriate for her safety-wise. We made a plan where I would clean out all the junk out of her place and make sure she had a safe environment but still save important heirlooms, necessities, etc. The nursing home could not have discharged her home unless the place was cleaned out. The plan was that we would minimize her belongings so that she could be able to move into a smaller, senior apartment with no stairs. I spent weeks of every minute of free time plus over $1000 getting her place cleaned out. It was clean, organized, neat and well-stocked with food and other necessities. She would finally be safe getting from room to room. I had had to throw out or donate over 4000lbs of stuff but was very careful to set aside and protect documents, family papers, heirlooms, artwork, etc. I also did repairs all around her apartment and added mobility and safety items which were needed. All out of my pocket. I also visited her almost daily and advocated for her with the hospital, nursing home, doctors, etc. 

As soon as she got home, my mother started complaining about this and that being gone despite the fact that I told her if I overzealously got ride of anything she actually needed I would pay to replace it. The only thing I had asked in return for all the work I did was that she not complain as this was all necessary or should could not have returned home but would‚Äôve had to stay in a nursing home. She had agreed to everything but now spent every day complaining via phone, email, and in person. Then she began drinking again and so far has done nothing to pay her medical bills but has already ordered so much junk online that her place looks almost as bad as it did in the first place. Just tons of junk and things she does not need. She will now never be able to move into a smaller, safer place and when she does die, I as the only child, will be forced to clean out all of her stuff again. It is maddening and I have to admit, I am so resentful, hurt and angry that it would be hard to do anything for her again. I at least thought, I‚Äôd be able to help her move somewhere safer and would not be stuck with that long-held fear of having to deal with a hoarder‚Äôs paradise when she dies. I understand how you feel completely. My sympathies are entirely with you."
