I truly used to believe that people’s lives were over by 30, and that’s when you gave up on trying. But, I finally see that even at 70, you still aren’t too old to change or try new things.

So I understand that side of things too.  Either way, better safe than sorry. I never let my guard down and it honestly kind of upsets me in a way when I witness other women being careless.
