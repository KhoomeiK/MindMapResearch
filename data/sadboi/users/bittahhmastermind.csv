careerguidance,fogfk56,t1_foebmiy,1587751937.0,"This is super helpful. Luckily my team doesnâ€™t make a big deal of clocking OT (they donâ€™t make me work OT either) but iâ€™d rather not make it habit and give them the expectation that i can work off hours all the time, so i will plan accordingly. Thank you for this! I really appreciate it!!"

From my experience, whatever experience you have by the time you start applying for jobs will matter the most. Not your degree! But I will suggest taking some editing classes and applying for internships in that field."
