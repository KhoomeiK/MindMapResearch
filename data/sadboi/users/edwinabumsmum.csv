Not again. Ronald McDonald has been haunting my dreams for the past six years.
Six years of fluorescent red hair and a manic unwavering grin haunting me. 
I sigh and heave myself out of bed. 
I pad into the bathroom to rinse the cold beads of sweat from my face. 
Steadying myself against the cool porcelain sink top, I look myself in the eyes, lined with heavy dark bags, a result of years of clown invaded sleep. 
‚ÄúYOU ARE NOT THAT FIFTEEN YEAR OLD FAT KID ANYMORE!‚Äù I whisper vehemently at myself.
And yet, the smell of salt, grease and self loathing lingers faintly in the air."

CrohnsDisease,exzetac,t3_culof3,1566664974.0,"Yes, I suffer vaginal and perinatal abscesses when flaring.

For this reason when I had my daughter I had a planned c section, as if I tore it would have ulcerated and not healed for a longtime. 

I am now prescribed a steroid cream for these flare ups and find bathing in Epsom salts with a few drops of tea tree helps to clear it up quicker and is very soothing. 

Wearing cotton undies and avoiding tights helps a little in preventing an outbreak. 
I find any ‚Äútrauma‚Äù (even sometimes just having sex with me partner‚Äù can trigger an outbreak if I am already flaring.

Definitely not herpes or any other STI - that‚Äôs all clear. My GP told me you can‚Äôt get Crohns in the vagina but my consultant and surgeon both confirmed that you can (and it sucks)"

A few minutes later she comes storming back in, cuts in front of the other guests in line at the desk and starts SCREAMING at me because.....a bird had done a poo in her car.

Apparently it was ALL my fault, if RUINED her day and, of course, she wanted to speak to the manager.
