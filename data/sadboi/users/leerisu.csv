unpopularopinion,erugtp3,t1_erug147,1561278992.0,"Sorry, but you have misunderstood me. I was learning about Japan for more than ten years, studying the language too for 3 years, also in university. Yes, I've been introduced to Korean culture through my bf, because before I only knew kpop and dramas, which is the thing I'm talking about in the post, but my experience with the Japanese culture is far longer.
My point that if you only know anime, some foods and some historical facts, you should think about it twice to move to Japan.
Many young people think differently now but you won't work to young people if you move there. In Japan, for instance, people won't tell you the truth in your face many times, which can cause misunderstandings. There are many other things that I can write, but this is an example.

In Korea, still in many companies they beat the workers, if they're from a developing country or just because of the color of their skin.

In Japan, you are not equal as a women to men, especially if you are a foreigner. If someone is from a country where this is not the norm, it's a serious issue.

Maybe you think you know my background, but you don't know what I study, how many friends of mine are Japanese or how many friends of mine worked or studied in Japan.

In my country, sometimes foreigners can have also bad experiences, if they don't know our culture and customs. What I'm trying to say is that before anyone considers moving to an other country and working there, they should learn about is in depths, because just watching animes and kdramas and speaking the language is not enough to actually have a good life there."
