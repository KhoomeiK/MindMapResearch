LibraryofBabel,fpf619s,t3_gd2uss,1588562637.0,"I think the Dog is really the best part. Really. That's pretty much the only reason why I bought the album, just so that I could stare at the picture of the Dog for hours on end.

The music really sucks, as you correctly point out, however the Dog picture is really hypnotic, really makes me want to listen to their music even more, and keep on buying their albums.

I'm serious man, that picture, those eyes, that big wet nose. They really knew what they were doing when they shot that picture. You know how everyone says that no one really knows what they are doing and that most professions are infested with posers that just learn to fake it until they make it? well I think that's true. When talking to a professional you sometimes get the feeling that they are just parroting what they read in some paper, it always feels like they don't have a clue of how the world actually works. Just take the current crisis, for instance. A couple of months ago the MSM was sating that the virus was no more dangerous than the flu, but why would millions of people be quarantined because of something like the flu? Anyway, I'm going a bit over some tangents here. What I really wanted to say was that the picture of the Dog on the cover is something different. I can't really explain it, but it is so beautiful, the composition is so perfect, the lightning, the colors, everything in that picture is perfect, is as if it had been shot by angels.

Lately I think I have been developing a bit of a troublesome habit. I always tell my wife that I won't be able to get home early because I have a lot of work to do, but the fact of the matter is that I was actually fired, just like millions of other people all over the country. I tell her that I'm working all day, and that I have to work until late because we are short on people, but the truth is that I spend all day at the library looking at that picture. I just can't help myself, every second that I'm not looking at that damned picture of the Dog I feel like I'm wasting my time.

I don't really know what to do at this point all I do is look at that picture all day, and most of the night, I think I sleep maybe like three of less hours, because I can't take my eyes of that picture, the picture of the Dog. My life is a bit of a mess right now, the money is running out and I think my wife is starting to suspect that something is wrong, I don't know what I will do once we run out of money, but I just can't stop staring to that picture, the picture of the Dog."

This may sound true at first, because coding is usually harder to get into, and even if you understand the syntax of a language, that does not mean that you will also know how to create complex programs. However I think that with experience you can express yourself with coding just as easily as you can do with drawing. For example take a look at the works under the [#つぶやきProcessing](https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%81%A4%E3%81%B6%E3%82%84%E3%81%8DProcessing?src=hashtag_click) tag on twitter.
