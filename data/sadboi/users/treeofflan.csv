In my experience, getting prescribed BC in my early twenties only masked the growth of endometriomas. Please look up “Nancy’s Nook” group on FB, it is not spammy and is strictly moderated: the admin of the group is a veteran retired RN who had endo and espouses Endometriosis Excision Surgery. Please feel free to DM me, your daughter is young and with the right treatment she can be pain free as well as greatly increase chances of having biological children. My heart goes out to her, I am pain free now but remember the pain all too well."

You take care now."
toastme,fofo1mv,t3_g5rx2e,1587739742.0,"It may feel furthest from the truth right now but this time of hurting is paving the way for the best yet to come. Heartbreak, specially the early ones, is just so extremely painful i am sorry you’re currently going through it...during a pandemic too. When I had my first heart break, i felt so sorry watching kids at play knowing someday they most likely will feel how i was feeling that time, but it did pass and I felt what I learned from that time was extremely valuable. Like, early relationships provide the compost for future ones, for self love, and a reminder to keep happiness in the palm of my hand. Lastly, you have beautiful kind eyes and an open sincere face. Take care and take time to grieve, drink lots and if you can, get some sunlight. You got this!"
