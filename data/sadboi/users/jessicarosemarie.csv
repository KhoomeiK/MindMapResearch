After recently finding myself and getting involved with a few guys, even ones most people would objectively describe as hot and well-suited for me, I just wasn’t feeling the sex. I’ve never had an orgasm with a male partner. 

This past month I was pursued HARD by a girl I work with, and I figured best case scenario I have fun, worst case it doesn’t work out. We clicked like I would’ve during a date with a guy, but when it reached the physical aspect, that’s when I thought to myself “that’s what’s been missing”. No hesitation, no shame, and no wondering if and when things were going to start to feel good. 

I chalk part of this up to having a partner with such open communication and emotional connection (something I haven’t had in the past), and the other half to maybe ignoring something that I knew I liked or could be good for me. Not sure how I identify moving forward, but the advice stands that if you see something you want, go for it :)"

Starting school this year has been a huge stressor, especially coming back as a mature student, and I feel like it’s forced me to go backwards in my journey of self improvement. Even if I didn’t have excellent coping skills, I was still able to manage a full time job, exercise and healthy enough social commitments and friendships. 

I’ve recently gone back onto a mood stabilizer, after about a year of being off medication completely. I am also concurrently diagnosed as bipolar 1, and I at this point am trying to manage too many things at once, both in terms of my lifestyle changes and emotions.

If you’re like me, when I’m in that headspace I use food as a comfort tool, and for the past month I’ve been binging on anything and everything satisfying in the moment but completely garbage in terms of nutrition. Not only that, but often this involves late night runs for chips and takeout, which also puts a strain on my wallet. 

Food impacts your mood, and despite being physically full, my body is malnourished from all the oils, sodium and processed sugar. As a result it’s no wonder I’m always sluggish and exhausted. 

Stepping back and deciding to plan your meals for the week, whether it’s making meal prep, or just planning a nice dinner for yourself, is a step in the right direction. This provides a reasonable achievement for your day, as well as making the choice to include some healthy aspect to your diet can give you the small burst of energy your body needs.

I don’t know a lot about LOTR, but Mount Doom could be stopping at Starbucks for hot chocolate, and The Shire could be driving through a neighbourhood at night with lots of pretty lights and Christmas decorations.

BPD,f96e1bp,t3_e3tjec,1575143726.0,"I work in retail, and I can completely relate to this. Strangers coming into my store asking me for recommendations about products or help with purchasing things never scares me— and to see me interact with them you’d believe I was the epitome of the perfect salesperson, outgoing, inquisitive and relentless. 

However with my coworkers I constantly assume as they walk by me that they’re judging me out of the corner of my eye, thinking that I’m less than the “fake” salesperson I’m able to transform into almost effortlessly, along with silently noting my other deep-seated insecurities. 

In my journey of self discovery I’ve noticed that what bothers me in these two scenarios is a power imbalance. With customers coming into a store asking for my help, I have power over them in terms of my knowledge of various products and my ability to flawlessly convey what items would be best suited to their needs. They are coming to me because I have a type of service that they need of me, and through this I have the upper hand in our conversation before they leave the store satisfied with their choices. 

With my friends, I HATE that this power struggle is not so black and white. Friends have the ability to be friendlier, prettier, better dressed or more well adjusted than I could ever imagine being. And every opportunity I have to spend time with them becomes me trying to regain the power I feel I’m loosing in their presence. If someone says something funny, I have a small window of time to reestablish myself as the humorous friend before the opportunity is lost. Similarly, if someone shows up to a party looking nicer than I do, I feel I’ve already lost the power for the rest of the night being second-best to someone who managed to try harder than I did. 

I don’t have any solutions for how I’m able to deal with this, but first noticing that your problem isn’t with the person itself, but rather how you perceive their unintentional gains over your own self worth is a step in the right direction."
