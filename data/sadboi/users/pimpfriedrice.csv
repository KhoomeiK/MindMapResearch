So we asked the hotel bartender and she told us that a politician ‚Äú‚Äùcommitted suicide‚Äù‚Äù by ‚Äú‚Äùjumping‚Äù‚Äù out of the 5th floor. She said that there is usually a lot of electrical type stuff that happens on floors 4-6.. we were staying on the 4th. So we went out and my bf left the tv on, I remember this because he made a comment about wanting to leave it on so he gets the full use out of what he‚Äôs paying for. We come back a few hours later, pretty drunk, sound is off on the tv.l and wouldn‚Äôt come back on. We DoorDash some food, start eating, the sound comes back on full blast. Mind you, we were drunk and were a litttle spooked but mostly forgot about it. Anyway, we left the next day. As we were in the elevator heading home, I mentioned to my bf that I was bummed nothing spooky happened during our stay (we had forgotten about the tv incident until the next day, because drunk). As I said that, the lights flickered in the elevator. But yeah, pretty cool building."
