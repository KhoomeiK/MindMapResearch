I do think that adhd medication is a bit different from insulin, or an allergy/asthma medication, though, because it doesn't actually address the root cause of the medical issue. I posted another question to expand upon this thought from a more philosophical pov. thanks again."

Vindicta,fqytpsn,t3_glf3mb,1589754396.0,"just generally cute, like a 6. i just want other people to overlook my social mistakes basically."
Vindicta,fqysmoc,t1_fqvu8cf,1589753884.0,"Well, the standards that most people on this subreddit use to evaluate how attractive someone is (ie. a ""Stacy"") is based on thin, white, cisgender women.

A TERF is a trans-exclusionary radical feminist, now often called ""gender critical feminists"". They are ""feminists"" who believe that trans women are not women, which is transphobic. This subreddit seems to exclude trans women, or at least does not actively welcome them. That's transphobic.

Eurocentric beauty standards example: Black women often have different shaped noses than white women, and Black women have different hair textures than white women. This subreddit puts an emphasis on having a small nose and generally long, straight hair to be a ""Stacy"". That is Euro/white-centric.

Fatphobia example: The massive praise for Adele's weight loss. Adele was gorgeous before. Plus-sized women are beautiful. 

I think the point of this subreddit should be building each other up and helping everyone look their best, not forcing people to conform to white, thin beauty standards."
TheGlowUp,fquho69,t3_gjiu33,1589659129.0,you're so pretty!! the only thing i would suggest is contouring could bring out your cheekbones even more. good luck!

I'm here because I think self-improvement on your own terms is interesting, and seeing how others think is interesting, but the fatphobia, Eurocentrism, and TERF-y vibes of this subreddit is literally the opposite of intersectional feminism."
BPD,fqgltl9,t3_giltnk,1589349789.0,Thank you so much for writing this. Realizing that I have been the toxic person in many of my relationships has been one of the hardest things I have ever done.

BPD,fqglo13,t1_fqfxrqd,1589349662.0,"Hey there. I just want to say, as a v sensitive person who basically can't control when i cry, I avoid having any charged conversations (especially apologies to others) until I have processed it completely and am confident I won't cry. Ultimately, it can still manipulate the other person, even if you aren't intending it to. However, I don't think getting emotional outside of these contexts where it might influence the other person's behavior could be manipulative."

I hope you're able to connect with folks who care about you at this time. We're all worthy of love and respectful friends. Best of luck <3"
BPD,fpqwgwx,t3_gezo8b,1588834319.0,"Hi there. I'm sorry to hear you're in a place where you can't get a diagnosis. I am also undiagnosed, hoping to eventually get connected to a mental health provider. BPD diagnosis is so hard to get -- it's really expensive and hard to find people who know about it/are willing to treat it. With that in mind, I think gate-keeping BPD resources is problematic. If you have done a lot of research and think that BPD is what you're experiencing, no one should make you feel unwelcome here, on Reddit of all places! We're all just trying to heal. I personally have found reading content and listening to podcasts made for people who have BPD (like Beyond the Border and Borderline Idealist) to be really helpful. I've found online Dialectical Behavioral Therapy resources really helpful, too. I think it's possible to use frameworks/resources created specifically for BPD to help yourself without claiming to be a person with BPD -- after all, BPD symptoms overlap with lots of other mental health issues too. 

TLDR; I don't think it's problematic to think of yourself as someone who might have BPD and seek out therapeutic resources accordingly while waiting for a diagnosis. You are valid, and your experiences are valid. We all deserve healing. Good luck <3"
BPD,fpquy6s,t3_gezra1,1588832995.0,"Hi there. I'm sorry for your loss. Congrats on rocking your last semester!

For careers, one thing would be, if you know what you like in a job and what you're good at. If you like social services, maybe having a career where you get to work with people would be right for you.

I've heard that jobs in the medical industry are pretty high paying, and in many of them you get to work with/care for people. Diagnostic medical sonography (like you mentioned), respiratory/cardiovascular or radiology technologist, dental hygienist, or RN all pay well (over 50k a year). Anything in tech pays pretty well too, and you can usually learn to code online. 

Good luck!! Best of wishes."

You've offered them so, so much -- offering to support them while they chase their dream, being willing to see past what you described as their immature/peter pan syndrome aspects. I'm sorry if I'm crossing a line or offering unsolicited advice, but I wonder if you might be settling? Only your partner can do the inner work of changing himself, and if he's not ready to step up to the plate (much less pursue his dreams), maybe you'd be better off finding someone who is more mature.

NPD,fn940au,t3_fwomlh,1586758658.0,"Hey, late reply, also raised by narcs. Honestly, I think that to acknowledge their narcissism (particularly if it would require them to acknowledge that they have abused other people) would cause them deep, deep shame. Because then, they would have to acknowledge the abuse they themselves experienced, and from what I understand, that abuse is the reason they created the fake personality to begin with. 

I read somewhere that the reason narcs blame everyone else/gaslight etc etc is because they are trying to take the deep shame that stews under their fake personality and put that shame on you instead. I kind of think this is true. 

Apologies, this was very rambly. TLDR; I think they are really very unhappy, but to admit it would lead to a soul-excavating process they want to avoid (of their past, their present reputation, etc). Plus, not caring about other people, I'm sure, is easy in a lot of ways.

DecidingToBeBetter,fn2j65d,t3_fyv7em,1586590943.0,"Fellow adult w ADHD! I definitely second asking follow-up/clarifying questions. If it's possible to ""prep"" for a discussion (ie. if you're in school or another somewhat planned setting), it can help to have some key insights that you want to say already in mind. Journaling about your thoughts (on anything really) can also help you express them to others concisely later on.

What I do (and I'm not great at it yet), is plan my day the night before, or when I wake up. I write down all the things I need to do, and then I prioritize them by importance, and then I make a rough schedule. If I have a big project, I break it down into little steps.
I think it really helps to, if you are able to, get washed first thing and get dressed. Step outside and feel the world going past if you can, it helps me get out of my head. And then I try to do things for half an hour to an hour and then take a break.
I also never really learned how to parent myself. Honestly, it's hard. You're doing a great job! Believe in yourself :)"
raisedbynarcissists,fn2fmid,t3_fyvv8o,1586587307.0,"No, I don't think you're overthinking at all. I think if you work through your past, understand how you think/act, and consistently work on things that aren't the traits you want to have, you'd be a great parent! The main thing is dedication to working on yourself, taking accountability for mistakes. Don't doubt your ability to grow and change!! 

I think a mindset of restorative/transformative justice can be really valuable for thinking about relationships (obviously only ones where both people are dedicated to being accountable and kind to one another). You have to have compassion for yourself when you make mistakes, and believe you are not disposable, so that you can be accountable when your intentions don't match your impact. You have to love yrself too!"
SkincareAddiction,fn2d3cq,t3_fyjtlu,1586584877.0,beautiful!!
BPDrecovery,fn1frfx,t3_fypgkt,1586561088.0,"You mention sex several times. Recovering from the trauma of assault is extremely difficult, and the fact that she never felt able to say no before meeting you (!) is probably a sign that she has had multiple unwanted encounters. The fact that she trusts you enough to say no (when bpd folks often live with a massive fear of abandonment) is a big deal. Learning that you are a valuable person and that it is okay to have boundaries is a hard thing for most borderlines.

Ultimately, sometimes what partners want and need just doesn't align, and it's not anyone's fault. No one owes anyone sex regardless of their relationship, and this itself is a mindset that can lead to intimate partner violence. Have you tried talking to her about what her needs are and addressing the difference in desires explicitly? It sounds like you need to adjust your expectations. You might consider talking about opening up your relationship while she is still recovering.

At the same time, take care of yourself if you are feeling rejected. Love and validate yourself. Your partner can only be one aspect of your support system, try leaning on your friends at this time.

Update: I feel like I was wayyy too mild bc everyone else who responded seemed to normalize the sex-expecting behavior. But I just want to make it clear that persistently demanding sex is not okay!! And if you can't be supportive of someone's trauma recovery journey and put their mental health over your own bodily expectations, you are probably not ready for a long term relationship and definitely not living w your partner! (and that is a polite way of saying, you might have narcissistic tendencies!!)"

I relate to some of the things you wrote - I'm a college student who has ADHD, and I really struggled with time management in high school (still do!). I agree, the way most people talk about intelligence, in my opinion, is pretty problematic. I think everyone is talented at something, and to say someone is or isn't smart is only valuing one limited form of intelligence (ie. being fast at memorizing, basically) that is often biased towards a certain demographic of people, and like you say, can be taught/learned. Websites like https://www.additudemag.com/ or https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/time-management have good time management tips even if you don't have ADHD. 

That being said, there's no one way to do college! And the image most people at prestigious schools project mostly isn't true, imo. I think if you know what you're good at/what you want to do academically/professionally, that's awesome, and you can continue taking classes in that vein to pursue that career path. But it doesn't necessarily have to be the same as what you study in general. For instance, I love music and the history of science and religion, but I don't study that at college since it's ultimately not what I could get a career in. You can still read/learn lots of things outside school!"
Mediums,fju8ldw,t1_fjp3rkw,1583614707.0,"Thank you for your take! I agree, I'm hoping to find a trustworthy group of mediums IRL who can advise me on this. Very interesting, religions can definitely distort things, I do think because they've been around for so long, they can offer a good starting point in terms of literature about specific light beings."

hsp,fii9g23,t3_f7uh1c,1582418808.0,"I relate to this a lot!! When I was really depressed, I had bad eczema on my hands and feet. When I recovered, it went away.

Often, when I move somewhere new, I will get sick in the process of moving, I suppose because of the new environment's ""stress"" on my body.

I have an autoimmune condition, and I've often wondered if it is somehow related to being an HSP. It's definitely related to stress. After I went hiking for a week, a significant amount of my symptoms went away temporarily."

BPD,f9dtgf8,t3_e4fs3f,1575236679.0,"I relate to this heavily, I've never been able to feel anything if people compliment me or if I win something, or ppl try to say they care. One thing that might help is looking at actions rather than words. People can say lots of things but at the end of the day, unless they're struggling with mental health or other things that make it hard to follow through on stuff (like ADHD etc), their actions show if they really care. If someone consistently is reaching out, wants to see you, gives you their full attention and listens to your needs, etc... consider their words might not be bs. You could also try to investigate where this mistrust comes from -- a hurt from long ago that could cause you to still try to protect yourself from hurt now, or something else like that ?"
BPD,f9dqzq5,t3_e4in47,1575236059.0,this is soooo relatable... especially if you don't have a whole lot of friends (like me) and then it just makes it rly hard to make friends lol b/c it's like you already care too much and have to downplay it but not toooo much
