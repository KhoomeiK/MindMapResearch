How people are suffering, so they take out on other more vulnerable people to make them feel stronger.i feel like that cycle stops when it hits people like you and me. We don't take it out on other people. We take that suffering upon ourselves and make sure we don't pass it on.

Just from one person with mental health problems to another, i think taking some time to weigh up what works and what doesn't can be helpful. Awareness of yourself is key. Try working out what you're triggers are, what are the things that make you feel good even if small.

Don't judge yourself for these thoughts. Try not to get stuck in feeling guilty. Also, whenever you think about, breathe deeply. In the nose, out the mouth, slowly. It seems like typical useless advice, but it has a physiological affect on you. Something so simple, but you'd be surprised how well it lowers stress and makes you feel better.

As for the violent thoughts or tendencies, there are many great ways to deal with it. The urge to squeeze the life out of something has been a perfectly natural human impulse since forever and we've always developed ways of letting out without hurting anyone.

So first, just realise there's nothing wrong with you for thinking about that. Even it gets really dark or specific or something, just know you didn't really create it. None of us really created our own lives, it's more like trying to work with stuff as it goes. Don't feel guilty.

You could definitely research it but a few obvious ideas could be boxing, maybe taking some old crap somewhere with a baseball bat and smashing the shit of it.

As for the other stuff, i get the pain. And i get how infuriating it is having everyone pressure you to be happy. It's like FINE fuck off im HAPPY now will you get off my case. So if you ask me, I am perfectly fine with you taking your time with things. You don't have to 100% happy instantly."
