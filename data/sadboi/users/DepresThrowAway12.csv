anhedonia,fjcgnde,t1_fjae67c,1583219371.0,"Always wanted to play an instrument and learn prior to being anhedonic... Only really started to try and play something after. If I was really able to feel things, I'd be a lot lot more inclined to really work at it. But it just feels so dull a lot of times. I do listen to some songs, but man, it's hard to really say that I enjoy anything. I find myself listening to songs that I enjoyed prior to anhedonia more than newer songs. For songs that I haven't heard and somewhat enjoy, I don't find myself listening to them for as long, and even so, it's really hard to connect with it. Like that invisible barrier between the things that I like and actually experiencing joy from it.

OP, it sucks, but if it was something we used to enjoy, surely it's still a possibilty.

It's probably one of the first thing that I've noticed... made me wonder if there's anything wrong with me. Then I've finally acknowledged it, as I saw other people who were at my age at that time, and even people a lot lot older still enjoying music and going to concerts and looking like they're really having fun."
anhedonia,f3hf0ro,t3_dgn535,1570922745.0,"I'm not really sure what my cause was. I think a big part of it might be depression, but I still remembered anhedonia coming along with my depression when I first started to suffer from it. I've went on some antidepressants and those didn't help... quickly got off them. Smoked weed before I've suffered from depression, have years of not smoking nor do I really find myself smoking any more and I'm still dealing with it. It's a lot of troubleshooting and I've tried quite a few things but no dice. I'm not giving up, but it's at the point where I've kinda accepted the way I feel, and it's nothing new to me. I don't care about it as much as I did before, but I certainly would be willing to do something if I **knew** it would make a difference."
anhedonia,f301xoo,t1_f0zxqes,1570544509.0,Yeap.
anhedonia,ezrynlv,t3_d1pi00,1568080550.0,"Yep. Definitely remembered that I would think to myself about how food doesn't taste as good... and because of anhedonia, not as enjoyable. Now, combine both anhedonia with a fading sense of smell/taste (could be a symptom of depression/anhedonia as well) and it's even worse."
anhedonia,ezrumlt,t1_ezb73dj,1568079024.0,"Yeah, it's quite irritating... I do prefer being alone and all that, but when it comes to having to actually have to be social, it sucks. I just can't do it on the bad days. I just feel so blank in my mind, just feels like saying something just to say something -- but I just can't feel the connection to it. It just doesn't flow, conversation just doesn't flow, and I just feel like I'm making it weirder for everyone who's socializing with me. During the better days, I'm better at socializing and conversation is a lot more fluid, but still, I'm unable to feel much."
anhedonia,ez0vo6v,t1_ez00c44,1567642561.0,"How long did you take SSRIs for? I've only took Prozac for about 3 months but I'm not even sure if I could say it was the main cause of my anhedonia. I've felt that way prior to taking it, and was hoping it'd help... but it just ended up making me feel worse. I hope it didn't cause any lasting damage. I've also took Wellbutrin for about 3 months as well."
anhedonia,ez0vi0q,t1_eywo1pt,1567642491.0,I guess in a way it also makes sense for why it's kinda hard to actually feel the joy out of anything. That invisible barrier/protection is just there.
anhedonia,ez0um46,t1_eyxjp3x,1567642142.0,"Hmm, you have a good point. When it comes to people having their preferences about things and hating on things they don't like instead of just moving on with it, I kinda wonder why. I guess I forgot how it's like to be really connected to how I really feel about things. If someone made fun of the restaurant I really like (and there's this one restaurant that a lot of my friends don't like), I could give less of a fuck about that. If I like it, I like it.

It's another benefit, I suppose. I feel like all these illnesses, while as shitty as they are, can be a blessing in disguise. I feel like I'm more perceptive about things, just thinking objectively as opposed to subjectively.

If I'm wrong, I'll own up to it. If I make a mistake, I'll apologize. I'll take the responsibility for things. It never really bothered me much to do so, but for others, not so much. It's like if I ask someone if they want to do this, and I honestly don't mind if they say no. I'd prefer a direct answer of ""no"" instead of waiting to see if the person is even considering it. It's like people think by saying ""no"" directly is gonna make me feel bad... like I really care. It's just more annoying that they think that way and think by not answering it's better... but I guess for them it's the easier way out. But at the same time I get a feeling that those type of people are the ones who will take offense to you saying ""no"", but then again I might just be assuming here.

Anyways, I got kinda side-tracked. Appreciate you sharing."
anhedonia,eyrpy8w,t1_eyjwra5,1567375083.0,"Whoa, that's actually how I feel. Although I wouldn't say that I've had social anxiety prior to anhedonia, it felt more like it just came along with it. I dealt with depression before my anhedonia gradually got worse, and perhaps it might still be my depression. But I totally know what you mean when you say invent a personality. Do you know those moments where someone says something and you simply have no response but when you laugh the laugh just sounds so fucking forced and fake? I just don't know man, I can't respond on the fly during these times. Even given time to respond I still won't think of anything I respond with something I connect to. Some days are definitely better than others but the past few months I've been feeling more and more anhedonic/apathetic again. I've been dealing with it for at least 6 years and there have been times within those 6 years (like prior to the past few months) where I felt okay with socializing and stuff...

Guess I'm headed back to the void zone."
anhedonia,eyrpkry,t3_cv42od,1567374803.0,"Anhedonia makes me feel worse in social situations. I feel so off and disconnected with things that when I say shit it just feels so forced. It's positive in the sense that I don't care if I'm ""missing out"", but if I'm in a social situation, it makes things worse feeling like I have to socialize but unable to due to not caring. I'd rather be home and alone instead.

Feels like anhedonia and apathy go hand in hand. Social situations don't matter to me because I don't find the joy in it or talking much.. hence also feeling apathetic towards everything."
depression,eyrkkv4,t1_eypn208,1567371045.0,"The hours of midnight to 4 or so are probably the most peaceful hours for me. I know for others it can probably be the worst, but again, we all experience it differently. I'm more anhedonic and apathetic than sad, so I feel like it's hard to connect with others.

But honestly. There is something about this feeling that makes me feel like it isn't so bad. When I'm in a state of not wanting to socialize and go out, when I do see friends hang out via social media, I don't get bothered.

I used to care and feel left out back when I didn't suffer from depression, now I'm kinda glad I don't deal with that feeling of missing out anywhere as much.

Sorry I went on but you can always PM me if you don't mind me sharing more or just talk."
depression,eypk8po,t1_eynueni,1567302532.0,I feel the same... I just can't seem to relax when there's somebody else around during these episodes. Even if we're just watching TV or something or not even talking. I just feel off being around people that I'd really prefer just being by myself.
