He did not claim it was Jesus's face. It was simply meant to prompt people to consider Jesus as being a man of his time and place, since we are never told he looked distinctive.”

It actually took me longer to get my baby out unbuckled and put her in the stroller. But she’s my baby and you bet I took the extra time to take her with me. That’s just just being a careless parent.

Edit- I got an implant a week ago and got dental sutures. Dentist just took a look and said it was healing well and walked out the door. I walked right in they know me already.
