AskGameMasters,fp12p47,t3_gadt5i,1588222785.0,"Don't overthink or explain things. In my expierence these campaigns thrive on create vivid imagery that the plauers can kinf od project on to. One of my favorite campaigns i ran was psychedelic and i learned Alot about making short but dense descriptions. Also lean heavily on themes of exsistential horror and dread. 

My psychedelic campaign kicked my ass but i learned so much."

worldbuilding,ff9xclz,t3_es6zeh,1579723552.0,"The Olum Zam was the gnomish home land. It was a series of hidden trails and pathways that became harder and harder to navigate as illusion magics became more complex. It was nearly impossible to enter and traverse the olum zam if you weren't a Zami Gnome. It is believed that the illusions of the Olum Zam had become a large winding demi-plane rather than just hidden villages and trails. The zami controlled most trade across the continent, they knew dozens of languages and had extremely detailed maps. But after the Gnomes were made forgetful and ignorant by the age plague the Olum Zam fell and its paths forgotten. Now the Olum Zam is known only through maps and stories but many people have tried to find one of the long and lost trails of the Olum Zam."
