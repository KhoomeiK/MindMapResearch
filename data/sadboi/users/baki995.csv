Disclaimer: I covered the name on the certificate purely for privacy reasons. 

The medal for merit to the nation was awarded 430666 times. It was awarded for merit in combat with the enemy for liberation of the country and for contributing to building a self-governing socialistic nation.

My grandfather recieved this medal for participating in the battles for liberation of Ljubljana, which was occupied and bordered off by italian forces in WWII. He was forcibly drafted into the Wehrmacht and after succesfully escaping a hospital, where he was treated for shrapnel wounds in his back, he joined the slovenian partisan movement (Cankar brigade), which massivelly helped with liberating Ljubljana.

I got this medal after his death, and soon bought the second medal, Medal for bravery. After that, my collecting took off."

Upon coming home and unzipping my backpack, I was greeted by a literal metric fuckton of small forest spiders pouring out from my backpack.

Turns out, they used the skull as a giant nest. Still kept the skull after thoroughly washing it and banishing the remainder of the spiders I was able to see, before they scuttled, to oblivion.

He had examples to show that he wasn't lying.

I thought about what he told me, he was right. So I worked on my behaviour, corrected it and now, we're good friends with some people from that group, who saw that I changed and wasn't a creep anymore. We even laughed about it.

But now, I have new roommates and I have the feeling that they see me as a creep. Maybe due to the fact that I am very anxious around new people and don't talk much, stutter and get annoying brain glitches, as in thoughts get lost and cant think of anything appropriate to say."

On the other hand, their selection is extremelly broad and with some luck, you could get a deal on some good medals.

Therapy didn't seem to work, so my parents decided exposure would be the best way to try. Firstly, with my sisters dogs anf some time later, we got a small pekingese poodle mix, Xena.
