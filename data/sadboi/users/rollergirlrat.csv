The best experiences I've had personally with guys was when I was completely not looking for anything I was just having a good time. Don't go to them, let them come to you. If no one comes to you don't worry about it because someone eventually will and you may miss it or you may score there's nothing wrong with either. Don't worry about falling in love. Don't drain yourself trying to put you and another person together. When someone tells you/shows you who they are/what they want, believe them."
