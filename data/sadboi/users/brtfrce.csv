Trust me after I met my wife on tinder and we got married and I started therapy, things have gotten better. 

It's amazing how your body holds on to these false concepts It's almost like when you're playing VR and  you see the chaperone lines around you. The difference is we can't see the chaperone lines in our own life that are holding us back but our parents created them and left them there for us to discover by finding the things that we try to force into reality in order to fit the delusion that they gave us. I don't know if your story is anything like mine or not maybe the things I'm saying don't matter But I know that toxic people be toxic. And if you're over here posting on self-hate, 99% chance you're not the problem. you feel bad because of the things people have said to you and the emotions that have been dumped on to you. You could be here because the world seems too hard and it's easier to hate yourself instead of see that the people you're disappointing are actually the people who are disappointing you.

I hope you find comfort in this world. We're not nearly as broken as we all think we are. You're human Take a moment breathe see the world through your own cognitive experience. Try to make slight changes, big sweeping changes never take hold."
