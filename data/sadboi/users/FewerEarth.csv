RedDeer,fajotzu,t3_e9g8pw,1576148900.0,"I've had sever depression for 6 years now, and we do have SOME stuff assistance available around Red Deer. But not alot. When I was diagnosed I was told by nearly everyone I talked to that it was all made up and in my head.
It's the mentality, people don't reach out or play it off because they assume everyone shames them. And as much as I hate to say it... central Alberta is kind of bad for it. I think I'm kinda turning this into a rant. But some places (IDA pharmacy) charges me $8 a pill for my medication. People will go without for that ridiculous price.
Just... take some time try bringing up their mental health once or twice, if they open up fantastic. But if they won't just sit them down tell them it's important. And confront them. People cant get better without first being uncomfortable. People who disagree with that statement won't make it as far as they could if they pushed for it ( yes I know I'm a hypocrite for doing it lol, don't let it happen to yourself!)
Sorry for the rant!"
