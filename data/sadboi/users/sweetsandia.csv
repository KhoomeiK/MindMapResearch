So let me get this straight- a MINOR robbed an able and consenting adult of majority age of his consent.

Under the law I think your mistaken.
It's the other way around doesnt matter if she lied or not. Having sex with a minor regardless if they verbally give consent is still statutory rape. 

OP robbed her! But  you guys are blaming her??

There is some demented victim blaming going on in the comments."

Why you so mean to her? If you think at 17 that she is an undeveloped person when it comes to sex with an older gentleman in accordance with the law, then why are you surprised that her inexperienced and under-developed brain lied about her age in the first place. Like she lied like a child because she is a child??? But now she is the one in the wrong and needs to take responsibility for her lies from when she was a minor?

I'm sorry OP if you suspected, then you should have acted on it as the only able and consenting adult between the two. 

I have no sympathy for you. REMEMBER ""Ignorance"" doesnt mean you are above the law.

Get a DNA test to make sure the kids not yours, 
Provide for her living situation if you feel you need to now that she is no longer a minor.

Then get the fuck out of her life. For your sake you better hope the child isn't yours.

OR

 take responsibility for engaging in sex with a minor if you are truly disgusted about the coupling. Like turn yourself in if you truly believe you committed a crime. Just because you weren't aware of her age doesn't excuse you from breaking the law. 

OR 

Forgive yourself for engaging in sex with a minor EVEN though you didnt know. Re-evaluate if you truly love her and fight the up hill battle to forgive her and forgive the situation.

 You are in it deep. You either stay on the ride with this young lady  or you get the fuck off the ride ASAP.


OP if you use the excuse that you think you are disgusted with yourself for being irresponsible 3 years ago just to get out of a relationship AND pregnancy then you are lying to yourself and absolutely not taking responsibility for your actions from 3 years ago.



YOU are her first expierence emotionally, sexually and psychology. If you leave this young woman in a WORSE condition than when you found her then you are just a coward."

I'm 23f an he is 59, we dated for 6 months, went steady for another 6 months, moved in together at 1 year of being together, lived together for 2 years and then been married for 2 years. 

I tell ya it's a roller coaster in the sense of gaining emotional maturity for myself. He is the first man I've dated after highschool, so I was completely new to the idea of relationships. I personally felt I rushed into things a little bit, yet I dont regret choosing him to be my one and only. If I could give advice to my younger self  before i got married at 21 i would have told her, ""it's okay to take it slow.  He is amazing and will help life feel like such a pleasure, but life is so overwhelming already so just enjoy him at a pace you both are comfortable with.""

I most likely wouldnt have listened lol

The pace him and I choose ended up being the fast-track course for my emotional growth and the fruits have been generous so far. But those fruits came at a cost of exposing my fears and insecurities without pause in between.

Take time to get to know yourself and you'll know when you're ready to take your relationship to the next level without hesitation."

backpain,fe0hsjj,t3_eni8hq,1578813641.0,"I've been in your boat! At least a similar boat lol

 I'm 23 and I've had upper, neck and lower back pain to the point of not sleeping or being able to sit or stand. My breathing is hindered due to caved in chest and my posture was terrible!  I'm thinking to myself what the fuck is causing such pain! Im too young to be debilitated by such pain especially since I've never had a back injury. For almost a year I've tried to figure out if it was stress or maybe I'm overweight or just not in proper shape. I've done back stretches, yoga, and chiropractors hoping that would help, but still nothing. 

It wasnt until the most curious thing happened while I was doing squats. I added in some squats to shake up my back stretches and I notice I felt a little less strain on my back. It was so minute, that if I wasnt concentrating, I wouldnt have noticed the small amount of relief. So I'm thinking to myself,  im gonna do a deep and wide squat to really fire up my glutes and quads!  As im squatting I had the urge to shift all my weight on my right knee, and bend it a little deeper to make sure my body weight was evenly distributed. Oh my god it felt so good! I couldnt hold the squat long so I stood up and notice the relief in my back immediately. How peculiar! So I proceeded to do wall sits and squats while having to focus shifting my weight to my right leg. Each time my right quad would shake and plead for mercy while my left quad would handle the excercise just fine. I've notice my shoulders and lumber area were more relaxed after the excercises. The most relief I've had in a year! My conclusion is that for a long time (not sure how long, could be years) is that my weight wasnt distributed equally. My left hip and leg muscles carried most of my weight. So my back was trying to compensate for the lack of equal distribution and it was under almost constant strain. I did some isometric leg excercises and omg the relief was amazing. I focused the excercises on my right glute, quad, hamstrings and groin to really build up it's strength. 

As long as I keep up the glute and leg excercises, my back is happy because it's no longer having to hold up the brunt of my weight. (my butt looks good too)  

I dont know if this is the answer you've been looking for, every person Is different. 
I was desperate for relief because the doctors were no help, so maybe it could work for you? 

I wish you relief OP :)"

As I do that I'm going to monitor my behavior, such as muscle tension, feelings and thoughts to see if they have been adversely affected. I wish I didnt have to do it by the trial and error method but that's  all I got.

I'm also reading about a doctor called Gabor Mate. I personally believe his insight is quite illuminating. His life's work is studying the connection between emotional repression and disease and how emotional trauma is connected to ADD. He blends allopathic medicine and naturopathic medicine beautifully as well as keeping an open mind of how spirituality and the soul could impact our health.

EDIT: I mentioned to my husband my concern and he brought up some excellent advice he gained from his meditation class. The analogy is you are sitting at a bus station, waiting for your bus. As other buses go by, do you hop on the bus that isnt yours? No, you just watch the other buses go by as you wait for yours. These anxious thoughts could be compared to the buses you have no desire to hop on. Anxiety could be the equivalent to riding a random bus to an unknown destination. Just watch that anxious feeling go by, knowing that's no your ride,  as you would watch a bus drive by at a bus station.

I know it seems silly to use the judgments of sci-fi characters to measure the ethics of abortion but I cant help but to wonder what would intelligent Extraterrestrials -who could be bound to codes of duty, honor and justice- think about killing even an embryo of a sentient being.
