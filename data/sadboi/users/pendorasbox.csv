But i started doing dishes right after using them which would never happen before AD. I could get out of bed right when i wake up. Before AD i had trouble getting out of the bed all throughout the day because of my anxiety.

I dont feel nervous/feel anxious about getting fired after having a normal convo with my boss. I dont obsess over the same thoughts over and over again. I went from fighting w my mom everyday to fighting with her twice a year. I can think clearly about issues instead of having a crazy emotional reaction to them.

So for me AD got rid of all the bad things I was experiencing in my day to day life. They dont make you happy though. They just make me feel more like a regular folk
