I told her that I will not belittle her for her belief because that‚Äôs what she has committed her heart to. Then I brought up a couple of examples of families who had different beliefs than each other and how they still gave each other respect and dignity. After that I gave her a couple of examples of families with differing beliefs that ended poorly because they didn‚Äôt respect or dignify each other. (My Book of Bible Stories came in clutch for once.) In the end I told her that even if she hates me or doesn‚Äôt want to be associated with me I told that I‚Äôll always love her.

internetparents,fb269xh,t3_eaxp1e,1576446020.0,"-Condoms do break so keep an eye out for that.

-Birth control is never a full proof way to keep from getting pregnant, but I know from experience it works very very well.

-Even if a woman is on birth control it‚Äôs still good to use a condom. This is for two reasons.
  1. It protects against STDs
  2. Birth control isn‚Äôt full proof
(That being said use your judgement to decide when to use a condom.)

-Not all sex is good sex. Bad sex is still nice though. Sometimes no matter how hard you try sex may turn out not being as great as you expect to be. Sometimes you can preform. Sometimes your partner doesn‚Äôt try. Don‚Äôt let a bad sexual experience ruin your perception of sex.

1. (This is big) Crypto has an awkward model. The way he moves makes him more agile in my experience. With his frame it makes it easier to hide behind small objects and pillars.

2. Don‚Äôt be afraid to hit yourself with your own EMP. I‚Äôve won several games where I pushed with my team while EMPing just for us to clean up shop.

3. If you see that your teammates are going to go down break off and hide. Use your drone to get their tags. Crypto‚Äôs always talking about being prepared so be prepared if they die.

Hope these tips are useful!"

Shield cells and bandages are easy to pop in a fight, shield batteries and Medkits can be popped in a fight if you‚Äôve retreated enough, and Phoenix kits should be saved for after a fight or if you‚Äôve broken of from a fight and you want to be ready for when they catch up to you again.

Situational awareness is another big one. When you were picking up your teammate you should‚Äôve thrown smoke. Also try to get some headphone that give off stereo so you can hear the directions your enemies are in. I‚Äôve won countless smoke fight because I could hear the direction my enemies were in.

You used Bangelore‚Äôs smoke a lot which is good because most Bangelores don‚Äôt use it as much as they should. There are three main ways I use.

1. As cover when getting downed teammates
2. Throw it on a distant enemy to give us time to advance on them
3. As a smoke screen to retreat (really effective with her air drop.)

Another big thing with her is to move around in her smoke. Most players I run into just throw smoke and hide in a corner or stand still and try to shoot at nothing. Be an apex predator and find them in the smoke. I don‚Äôt typically play Bangalore but I when I run into them and they throw a smoke on themselves I can typical run into it and kill them because they‚Äôre just shooting randomly and I can find them."
