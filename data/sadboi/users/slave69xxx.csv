depression,f0tlcxt,t3_d6dxpl,1568924292.0,"I feel this.


I can't even let myself get into anything with girls. A few girls in the last year asked me to go out and i just dodge it ( i believe one likes me a lot and still thinks of me and i'm just struggling) because i don't believe i'm able to have a relationship and not feel guilty about it. Also being super unstable and unhappy surely won't make her happy. I think i should love myself first before i can love someone else. But on the other hand i wonder if a girl could help me get through this. Constant cycle with no end."

I realize every single thing and think about how everything is and everyone feels. And that ultimately gets me more and more depressed.

 I constantly wish i was dumb, because most of my less intelligent friends don't worry about things as much, and are overall happier with their lives. 

I guess that's just how it is when you are dealing with existential weight."

I'm also told to be attractive and i don't see it. The problem is we don't love ourselves, so we can't really accept love from others.

I was on a few and not one did much but fuck me up even more. My story matches yours so far but i hope yours doesn't turn as bad as mine did. Good luck!"
sleep,eomdn40,t3_bscryv,1558686727.0,Yeah i feel you on that one. Maybe do a physical activity an hour or so before you sleep (like a walk or a run) and then stretch/roll. Helped me a lot before i got injured. Now i'm just groggy all the freaking time.

sleep,eo8q3go,t3_bqx301,1558372353.0,"For the first part, i had similar problems when i was younger. I always thought someone was watching me when i closed my eyes to sleep. I think it's some type of paranoia. At first i only fell asleep with my back against the wall/close to the wall. Then i tried to make my mind busy before i fell asleep by reading or praying or doing confidence/breathing drills. That helped me a lot since you kinda skip the process of falling asleep which causes the tension that makes you paranoid. Try covering cameras on your devices so you feel more secure. I hope the hallucinations don't come back! 
That's just my take, i hope it all works out!"
