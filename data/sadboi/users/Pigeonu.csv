AmItheAsshole,fmqx6kd,t3_fwsae1,1586309004.0,"YTA because of how you responded to it. Basically just “people might’ve found out anyway and I don’t want to be in a relationship with someone closeted so oh well”

If it was such a problem for you, you shouldn’t have pursued a relationship with someone still in the closet. 

Also for how you’ve written this. You mention nothing about WHY he’s not out to his friends and family. I suspect that if he’s been with you for three years and he’s not out, there’s something going on there that you’re not telling us."

Give your local donation center a call and ask what they’re doing."
AmItheAsshole,flioy4m,t3_fp1qhw,1585187310.0,NTA  It’s nice that you helped someone that you don’t seem to like and gave her the good advice to not do this. It was shitty of her to get angry with you just because she was embarrassed.

You don’t deserve to feel like people are embarrassed by you. You have nothing to be ashamed of."
aspergirls,fjil06w,t1_fjiiwuy,1583369957.0,Exactly what I was thinking. I never tell anyone I work with that I’m autistic. I can’t think of a situation in which they actually need to know.

StopSelfHarm,fj6bs17,t1_fj4jb49,1583066330.0,"Yeah attendance policies are rough. I meant that schools generally help you take a leave of absence if there’s an emergency. If you’re thinking about hurting yourself and need to take a break to get help, that’s an emergency. 

I don’t know you or your school, so I don’t know if that’s the right choice. It’s just what I had to do. If there’s mental health services on campus, they can help you figure that out or lend an ear.

I wish you the best in this. Take care."

StopSelfHarm,fiwylml,t3_faazq7,1582807802.0,"I feel the same way about therapy. When problems are coming from external sources (family, living situation, health, etc.) therapy can help you cope but it can’t solve them if you can’t change your circumstances.

When I finally had control over my situation, I was able to work on myself. Might even give therapy another go.

Idk what you’re going through that you don’t have control over, but things can change once you have control over it."

Thanks for making me think about this. I think I’ll call her and tell her I love her. Also maybe clean the living room lol."
trashy,fis5moy,t1_fis3xfu,1582678304.0,"Hey sorry, I was talking only about HIV being transmitted purposely in the manner the comment was discussing with the “three” number. I got that from a text for class in which we discussed myths about HIV. If I find it, I’ll edit to let you know.


I also figured it was clear I was saying needle attacks with intent to transmit disease are rare and not that needle attacks never happen. They clearly do. We’re looking at a needle attack in the post. I’m sorry for not communicating that better."
trashy,firvz6o,t1_firmhim,1582672224.0,"The kind of attack they’re talking about in the original comment is specifically to transmit HIV. HIV has been transmitted with a needle purposely 3 times, all by people that knew the victim. Two of those were just the person lying about what they were injecting (so not an attack).

It’s a dangerous myth that stigmatizes HIV+ people and furthers the idea that they all purposely infect people. 

Other needle attacks appear to be rare as well. When I looked for news stories about them I found two and one of them was about this video.

Edit: someone further down had a few more if you want to read those articles. Still pretty rare."

aspergirls,finmfhd,t3_f8tqgu,1582565960.0,I’m sorry you broke up. That’s always tough. What worked for me and my girlfriend is that I told her early on that I’m autistic and what that means specifically for me. It’s frustrating for her sometimes but she knows it’s an ongoing issue and not me saying that her feelings don’t make sense/picking at her.
aspergirls,fidkw4a,t3_f7jydt,1582368219.0,"As someone who did drop out of school and decided to go back later, I think she probably needs to come to that specific conclusion on her own. She might just not be ready yet. I wasn’t at her age. I worked for a year and went back better prepared (got accommodations, found better studying strategies, didn’t work part time anymore, etc.)

Second, you said your mom was nodding along when she was talking about how she’d always be depressed, etc. Your sister needs support from her family. You might want to address that along with finding local autistic adults who can share how they navigate the world and she can see they’re not doomed. That’ll be more helpful than just stories online imo. My library used to have a weekly social so maybe a local library has something."

My mom got so sick they thought she’d die last year and she didn’t tell me because she didn’t want to interrupt my schooling. I was so angry I can’t even explain it. I still haven’t forgiven her for this. And she didn’t even die.

Again, I understand why you don’t want to tell them but this is going to really hurt them."

Wasting someone’s time like that is a shitty thing to do though. Don’t wait a month to break up with him. You know it’s not going to work so let him know respectfully and let him find someone who’s going to like him for who he is. I suggest doing it at the beginning of January."
