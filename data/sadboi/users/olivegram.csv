Because I get creeped out when I notice people staring at me, (I usually draw attention to it by shouting to them, waving, etc,) I try not to make others feel that way. Its common courtesy. 

Not only that, But I can guarentee that people notice when you stare at them. Not 100% of the time (but far more often than you think) and only resume their actions out of politeness or inability to handle the situation. 

People also notice when you don't meet their eyeline or make direct eye contact. Lots of people (expecially interviewers) use this to gauge a person's ability to be direct, be honest, etc. 

I don't have anything else to say to you, but I want you to consider that people are more aware than you may think. Not in a 6th sense situation, but on a social level. If we met in person, I doubt we would get along very well."

If we only focused on the extremely negative stuff, this would be marked as a anti-men group (as opposed to pro-women and women's empowerment). 

Not only that, but many women cannot read the truly bad stuff, as  it is a constant reminder of the negative thoughts we ALREADY keep in our heads every time we: walk to the car at night, go someplace unaccompanied, or forget to lock the doors at night. Not to mention most women have lived some version of those experiences.

As a woman who was considered ""radically feminist"" for my small town, (but now understand that I actually held conservative views relative to the rest of the nation) can I just say I am extremely grateful to this sub and it's mods? 

This sub (and some others like r/notlikeothergirls , etc.) has really opened my eyes to hidden and engrained bias against modern women. The safe space created here has really allowed my mindset to grow. 

No one would know this based off my appearance and attitude, but I used to think to myself ""I know I don't want to be a boy, I just don't want to be treated like a girl."" 

I since phased out of that mindset and later discovered this sub, which helped me tackle some of my internal bias and feel comfortable in my own skin.
 I find it amazing that so many men ACTUALLY WANT you to feel uncomfortable being a woman, (and don't feel comfortable with THEMSELVES until you do) while not being able to comprehend any other perspective other than themselves and their own penis. 

It hit me today reading this post how much hate the mods must wake up to everyday. Thanks for filtering out the smut so I can gain some perspective on myself!! I am finally comfortable being a woman and this sub helped me on my journey.

AmItheAsshole,f9kgm73,t3_e5dc9j,1575400031.0,"Heres a Play-by-play, from what I understand:

>We’re all in our early 20s. My girlfriend hangs out with Amy quite often  

***( GF has a steady friendship with her friend Amy)

>Dinner was going alright until Amy’s boyfriend innocently commented on how little my girlfriend ate.

***(Amy's boyfriend expressed the only other woman's eating habits at the table were less than her own while they were side - by - side, eating)

> After that, Amy, who isn’t stick thin like my girlfriend, snidely remarked that my girlfriend wouldn’t need fake boobs if she ate like a real woman. 

***(Amy felt self concious, and tried to make a joke that came off as snide, [as she was also making a direct comparison to her friends eating habits and weight,]  in an attempt to frame herself as ""healthy/Normal"" rather than ""fat"". 
***It is quite possible your GF was aware of this, and therefore doesnt see her comments as maliciously as you do) 

>I loudly told her to watch her fat goddamn mouth and that her comment was both rude and unnecessary.
 
***(You tried to fix the issue between her and her friend, publicly, loudly, and while calling her friend ""fat"". *** probably slicing through possibly a more ""attempt to make this light hearted"" vibe on her behalf with a clearly malicious tone. **** You are also a MALE commenting on her weight, which stings.)

>Many people turned their eyes toward us. 

***( You made a confrontation feel unavoidable, as if there were no way to get past this while allowing Amy to ""save face"")

>My girlfriend still thinks that Amy didn’t mean to hurt her with the “real woman” and “Barbie doll” comments and I didn’t read the room correctly. She told me she feared Amy not wanting to be friends with her anymore after my creating a rift between them.

***( You created a rift in a female friendship, as Amy will no longer be able to pretend everything is fine between the two of you, And created pressure on the GF) 

YTA : Yeah, Amy was an asshole. But women understand letting eachother have their dignity in order to remain friends. You turned something that, if your GF *DID* have an issue with, would have been a squabble. Now, she may have lost a friend. Why? Because reasons completely out of her control. The only person I feel bad for is the GF. Seems like she's surrounded by people who take things at face value."
