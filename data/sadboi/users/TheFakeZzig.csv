My updated point is that if you're demanding that people be familiar with a particular interface, you shouldn't be involved in the hiring process for developers (ops, perhaps).  That would be like expecting every applicant be familiar with Emacs; if you can code, IDE doesn't matter, and if you can commit, Git interface doesn't matter.

learnprogramming,fq8cy7c,t1_fq8c78l,1589163383.0,"It is, though I believe how you go about that depends on the version of JS you're using and whether you're using prototypes or classes.

If you're only adding it to your single array object:

    houseCleaning.cleanStatus = () => {
        // do something
    };
    
    houseCleaning.cleanStatus();

If you're adding it to \*all\* arrays:

    Array.prototype.cleanStatus = () => {
        // do something
    };
    
    houseCleaning.cleanStatus();

That's the prototype idea.  I believe the class version eventually becomes the prototype version, so it's useful to know how it works under the hood.
