trashy,fkhsasg,t3_filepx,1584205050.0,"Over the next three days, Noah Colvin took a 1,300-mile road trip across Tennessee and into Kentucky, filling a U-Haul truck with thousands of bottles of hand sanitizer and thousands of packs of antibacterial wipes, mostly from “little hole-in-the-wall dollar stores in the backwoods,” his brother said. “The major metro areas were cleaned out.”

Now, while millions of people across the country search in vain for hand sanitizer to protect themselves from the spread of the coronavirus, Mr. Colvin is sitting on 17,700 bottles of the stuff with little idea where to sell them.

“It’s been a huge amount of whiplash,” he said. “From being in a situation where what I’ve got coming and going could potentially put my family in a really good place financially to ‘What the heck am I going to do with all of this?’”

Mr. Colvin is one of probably thousands of sellers who have amassed stockpiles of hand sanitizer and crucial respirator masks that many hospitals are now rationing, according to interviews with eight Amazon sellers and posts in private Facebook and Telegram groups from dozens more. Amazon said it had recently removed hundreds of thousands of listings and suspended thousands of sellers’ accounts for price gouging related to the coronavirus."

bipolar,ewwxdmw,t3_cqekuw,1565837846.0,"Stick with it friend. For me, the first month was fairly easy because it’s the honeymoon period, when there is excitement about change. It’s the few months after that were really hard, and I hit “the wall.”  I got an addiction counselor at that point. $35/session after insurance. that’s what she called it - hitting the wall. She helped me get through the next few months, and by month 6 or 7, I felt so good physically and mentally I didn’t want to drink anymore. A few insights that worked for me. Relapse is so hard to avoid because your brain gives you a shot of dopamine/seratonin/whatever the moment you DECIDE to to have a drink/drug. It’s not even the drink itself - the “reward” comes sooner from a simple decision.  That’s the addict brain, not my rational thinking. Understanding that my brain was being hijacked for a short period helped me control it. So when the impulse was really strong, I stop and wait five minutes. You can do ANYTHING for 5 minutes. Eventually it’ll pass. “Fast forwarding” also helped me get through the urges. Ask myself, “am I going to have one drink or two? Three or four? How will I feel afterwards?  How will I feel when I wake up tomorrow?” Getting the mindset out of the “now” can keep that decision at bay too.  The social part is hard depending on your age, friends and family. But these days, most people are super respectful. Virgin cocktails at events. I know a guy who just fills a beer bottle with water.  Or maybe, just don’t go. If you are under 30, there is FOMO. Let me tell you, forget that shit.  Nobody cares what you do or who you see by late 30s, not least you. Get yourself to that place sooner. Find new social circles if you must, new hobbies, different weekend activities. You (and your future self) are worth it. BTW, I’m bipolar too. Keep taking care of yourself there too. You gotta maintain that emotional balance. Too low, I wanna drink. To high, I WANNA DRINK!!  Studies show consistently a combo of medication and therapy has the best outcomes. And hey, bipolar meds have NO side effects!  I lost 35 pounds after switching from antidepressants to mood stabilizers. It’s not a sprint - incremental steps to self improvement and always looking for additional means of support and education - counselors, podcasts, books, support groups, finding an enjoyable form of exercise. Etc etc. “It’s not easy, but at least it’s simple.”"

But maybe also Trying to impart a lifetime of wisdom and experience into the child, knowing it won’t actually go through. But that’s alright, because even though beautiful and painful experiences are coming his way, the boy will navigate it all just fine. and in 60ish years, hopefully sooner, the boy will arrive at the same realization grandpa is trying to communicate at this moment: that everything will be ok."

TooAfraidToAsk,evlc5we,t3_ck6fdj,1564592900.0,"There are different levels. Sometimes it’s not terrible - you can still go through all the motions of life, such as going to work, showering, raising kids, even hanging with friends. You just don’t get any joy out of anything or have any motivation to go beyond the basics. “normal” people wake up in the morning with an empty glass to fill up that day with the various stressors, motivations to do things like work out, be proactive, adulting that comes your way. When depressed, you wake up with the glass already half full, or more. So just a rough morning getting the kids out the door already has taxed all your energy for the day. Or sleeping too late provides enough shame to ruin the entire day. At the very difficult end of the spectrum, when people can’t get out of bed, it’s just not your brain that is depressed (psychological). Your entire body is depressed too (physiological). It’s not mind over matter, you physically cannot get out of bed."

gaming,eu20bq5,t3_ceaexp,1563379522.0,"Not to mention it depends on WHAT you read. Many books aren’t expanding your knowledge (good nonfiction) nor giving you new insights into the human experience (good fiction). Most new and popular books are purely entertainment.  Or reactionary pseudo-self help ruminations based on societies’ current environment which don’t stick a month later and are irrelevant 5 years later.  I read a fair amount of good non-fiction and fiction  (loved Sapiens) and listen to audiobooks in the car, mostly business books as I own a real estate company. But I also play ALOT of Call of Duty too. COD is better for my mental health, as long as it stays in moderation and I don’t get furious when dying too often."
todayilearned,etkdxrt,t3_cbulci,1562895510.0,"In Portland,OR you could never flag down a Cab. There wasn’t enough biz for them to just drive around the city all day. You had to look up a phone number online, call, request and hope that they actually showed up 30min later. Usually they did. When they didn’t... imagine being at a bar at closing time. 

The cab drivers protested by parking their cars all day in the middle of a main public square. 

Portland was one of the first cities actually for UBer to test a new method of getting past city regulators.  After being stonewalled, they just turned on the app anyway. The city commissioners got all fussy and threatened lawsuits. Uber took it away again, but we loved the service so much compared to the taxi situation in Portland, the public backlash was fierce. Every time we opened the Uber app, they provided a nice message hoping they could return and suggested we contact our reps. The city made some regulation adjustments to help out the cabs and then relented."

Now at 38, I wanna go give that kid a hug and tell him to relax. My god, how young and naive I was. I’m doing pretty well now by conventional standards, and wouldn’t want to go back to that age. Fear of missing out, competition with yourself and peers, insecurities, seeking acceptance or praise from others... all that goes away in the next decade. It’s a blessing. And at 38, i sometimes feel old, but I’m reminded that people in their mid 60s say they look back and realize 40ish is when adult life really began.  They didn’t realize how young they really were. Chillax dude. It’ll be great."
