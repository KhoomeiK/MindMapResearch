CoronavirusRecession,fqqj4hm,t1_fqqfctn,1589566417.0,It looks like Bezos owns 11.2% of Amazon. I‚Äôm suggesting he could sell $1 billion of his own shares of however many billions of dollars of shares that he owns. Then he could distribute the profit of that sell to Amazon employees as a bonus or whatever. What part of this is stealing?
CoronavirusRecession,fqq34xk,t1_fqpzrr6,1589558590.0,"I didn‚Äôt know that about his salary. So thank you for explaining that.

But say he sold $1 billion in shares of Amazon. Assuming 15% tax, that would give him $850 million in cash. If he distributed that money evenly among the 840,000 employees at Amazon, then each employee would get about $1,000. For all those warehouse workers and others working at the bottom, that money could really make a difference."
CoronavirusRecession,fqq0o73,t1_fqpxob3,1589557377.0,"Interesting. If he isn‚Äôt awarded new stock, then I wonder how much he is compensated each year."
CoronavirusRecession,fqpxdrn,t1_fqpcsmr,1589555712.0,"But how often is he awarded more stock? If I were  as wealthy as he is, I would be willing to take no future compensation, whether it is in cash or stock or whatever, so that that wealth could distributed among employees and hazard pay could be extended."
