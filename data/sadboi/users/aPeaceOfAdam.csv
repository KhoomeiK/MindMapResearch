Abstract: A three-country study was undertaken to assess the educational efficacy of two textbooks authored by the researcher. The same texts were distributed to groups of student nurses in the United Kingdom, Cambodia, and Kenya. A data collection tool was developed to obtain quantitative data and to ask open-ended questions on how useful readers found the texts to be. Quantitative data indicated that the books were useful in areas such as aiding understanding of scientific and medical terminology and helping nurses to assess their patients and understand nursing care. It was also found that simplified diagrams were a useful modality for communicating bioscientific concepts. Answers to open-ended questions indicated areas where the texts could be improved. Evidence for how useful bioscientific concepts can be to improving patient assessment and management was also identified. Significant agreement between quantitative data and answers to open-ended questions was noted. It was concluded that the same texts could have a significant degree of educational acceptance and efficacy in wildly differing cultural and national situations. This approach to resource production and distribution also forms a model other educationalists may choose to adopt."
Coronavirus,fipuftg,t1_fiptxz9,1582621949.0,"So, I might pull you up on a couple of things before I register what my issue is with his coverage.

First, it's true MBBS is a bachelors degree, but it's a 5 year bachelors degree that is very rare (almost impossible) to get into without a ""pre-med"" bachelors degree.  Most people do biomedical science or nursing for their ""pre-med"" so generally a MBBS is 8 years of medical study to qualify FOLLOWED by 1 year of internship and 3 years of residency and THEN you get to start studying your specialty.  So while it may be technically correct to say medicine is a ""bachelors degree"" the reality is that a virologist would have 12 years of medical study BEFORE they started their virology study and after they finished that (prob another 8 years) they THEN do a PhD anyway.  So there is a massive difference in terms of experience and knowledge between someone who has just done a PhD and a medical specialist who has done a PhD.

My issue with this guys coverage is that he's being introduced as a ""health analyst"" with the moniker ""dr"".  But in reality he is a nurse who's PhD was not even in medicine, it was in whether his own nursing textbook was an effective teaching aid.  

It is reasonable for someone watching a commentator being introduced as a ""doctor"" and a ""health analyst"" to assume the speaker is a medical doctor or an epidemiologist.  I certainly assumed that.  This guy is neither.

I mean, there is a campaign to have this guy made head of the WHO for crying out loud, I doubt many of those people know that he's 1) not a medical doctor and 2) didn't even do a PhD in a medical specialty"
Coronavirus,fiptsgp,t1_fio7im9,1582620996.0,"hes not a doctor though is he?

1)  Narcissists exist, in both genders, in all professions and at all education levels.
2) Narcissists are formed during childhood, they will never see a problem with their actions, you will never change them, they will never see what they do as wrong.  They do not have the capacity for the self insight personal change requires.
3) Everyone needs to be able to spot a narcissist.  It’s not hard, buy a book on it, they have a bunch of recognised traits such as an inability to apologise, that are a dead give alway.
4)  when you identify one, don’t question your judgement!  Getting you to question yourself is one of the narcissists first tricks and it’s the one upon which all the other tricks rely.  Simply remove this person from your life or, if that’s not possible, limit the damage they can do.  

These people are to be pitied for sure, they didn’t do this to themselves, it’s the result of a bad childhood, but it will take decades of therapy for them to change and that is in the exceedingly rare case when they can admit to having a problem and needing help and ALL that time they will be actively trying to hurt you...it’s just not worth it."

Let me be clear, I think even talking about gender when addressing DV instead of talking about “perpetrators” and “victims” is counter productive but if you want to talk gender you better come correct, with real stats from reputable sources."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fgrfw5t,t1_fgqgann,1581045814.0,"I honestly don’t think it’s that complex or deep.

First, there is more in common with “perpetrators” and “victims” than “male” and “female” so it really doesn’t make much sense to view behaviour through the prism of gender imho.  Narcissistic perpetrators of DV tend to act very similarly regardless of gender and so do victims, so it’s more valuable to understanding them is we don’t group by gender.

With respect to wanting someone to fight back, it would be unusual for a narcissistic (which many DV perpetrators are) to put that much thought into someone else’s behaviour.  These people don’t have the empathy required to think such complex thoughts about other people’s behaviour and they also genuinely don’t tend to think they are doing anything wrong, why would they try to set up an alibi for something they honestly don’t think they’ll ever need to justify doing.

What I personally believe happens is they just grab information from surrounding conversations and mash it into sentences that they throw at the victim to gauge what hurts and what doesn’t, kind of like cold reading.  If the victim reacts they continue this line of attack, if not they abandon it.  If you’ve ever seen a conversation between a narcissist and their victim the narcissistic goes through accusations at an absolutely astounding rate.  The victims can barely begin to defend one accusation before they are presented with another until one is put forth that stumps the victim and that’s the one the narcissistic attacks with.  The joke “the narcissists prayer” captures this perfectly.

So, in this scenario I think it’s no more well thought out then “he said he didn’t want to hit me, and claims that he doesn’t love me hurt him previously, so if I take the thing he did and use it as a reason he doesn’t love me I will hurt him and win”...and because this entire thought process is subconscious, she’s probably not even aware of it.

We need to dispel the myth that narcissistic DV abusers are these evil, manipulative geniuses.  Most have trouble even functioning in society without victims to do very basic life skill type things for them.  Most of them are victims of bad parenting or bad childhoods.  When you see them through this frame of thought you start to see how what seemed Machiavellian is actually just desperation and childishness (watch very young kids trying to get away with something, they do the same thing).

I wonder if it’s all ancient history and just selfishness...do girls who study Egypt talk too much?  Women who study the fall of Rome never do their share of the dishes?  Girls who study the Persian empire have cold feet?"

videos,fgjwdv6,t1_fgj4nl5,1580852685.0,"Staying calm in the presence of an abuser is unfortunately a learned behaviour of a domestic violence victim.  The saddest thing is he’s obviously still at a stage where he believes there is something he can do, some behaviour change he can make, to make his abuser stop.  He’s still trying to figure out why it’s happening.

It’s happening because she’s a bully and a criminal.  Domestic violence abusers almost never change, and not without some serious intervention by very qualified professionals."
