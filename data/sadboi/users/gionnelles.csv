MachineLearning,fo8u6ie,t1_fo7omdr,1587603915.0,"This is almost verbatim what my company is going through. We have been using TF since original beta, and long before TFX came up with our own model management pipeline suited to our much smaller team sizes. TFX is comprehensive, but its almost hilariously bloated for a small team deploying on-prem at some private cloud. Almost nobody operates at the scale Google does, and TFX doesn't have a Lite version for everyone else.

We rejected PyTorch early because it didn't seem to include any deployment options at all, poor distributed training, and few teams in industry were using it.

I do a re-evaluation of our tools periodically and I lead an applied research team taking current papers and implementing the techniques in functional prototypes. In the last year the number of academic papers using PyTorch has skyrocketed. As a result my team is all starting to develop in PyTorch. 

The other big push towards PyTorch is the appalling lack of documentation and backwards compatibility in TF2.x. For all of our production models we are basically stuck to TF 1.14 because anything higher breaks every model. Some of the features we use don't even work properly in TF 2.x.

PyTorch is also frankly much easier to read, write, and debug. It has clear documentation and tutorials which actually work with the published version. I have been working with the framework very briefly and I'm already pushing my company towards being predominantly PyTorch for new deep learning models."

leagueoflegends,fncxvcs,t1_fncxjfl,1586851048.0,"> Swain has a new identity as a support now. So it's to be expected people would play him support over solo lanes.

This is exactly the point I (and other former Swain mains) have been trying to make. Riot should just say, ""Swain is played more often and more regularly by support players, so we're happy keeping him in that role."" Don't use the tiny percentage of solo laners to indicate he's doing swell in solo lanes. 

That's the part that feels disingenuous."
leagueoflegends,fncx8vf,t1_fnchvoz,1586850395.0,"I'm not basing my first point on nothing. I'm literally using the metric they are showcasing as an example of how ""successful"" this rework was... that the champ is played extensively by the few people who play him. I am simply arguing with Riot's assertion that this by itself is a good thing. We have seen in other Riot analysis that champions who are played more broadly (by non-mains) have a lower winrate. This is frequently pointed out about ASol. ASol often has an extremely high winrate, particularly in Plat+ ELO, but his winrate by itself isn't necessarily concerning because he's only played by ASol mains, without novice players to the champ who would drive his winrate down.

The problem here is simple: Riot sees overall playrate up and is happy with the outcome. The playrate is up *slightly* by changing his role from a solo laner to a support, which isn't what existing Swain players wanted. This is the same thing that's happened with Graves, Taliyah, and any number of champs who have been roleswapped by kit changes.

I would like to see charts showing a per patch playrate/winrate in solo lanes for low and high ELO. It would be interesting to see if new Swain is actually played less than old Swain in solo lanes since the reworks."
leagueoflegends,fncdpzh,t1_fnccef5,1586834284.0," I know the company has good analysts, but this isn't it. 

The charts seem intentionally designed to take out context. Like, the chart with ""stickiness"" showing from 0.75 to just over 1% with this big swing indicating this wide adoption of the champ. Show those adoption numbers compared to other champions at low, mean, high values. 

Also show the same timeline for playrate by patch, with the same context of other champions.

You have an incredibly niche and unpopular champ who got a great visual rework, and his power changes from both original rework and minirework make him a support champ. His playrate picked up in solo lanes until nerf to ult and then minirework, then dropped. Did it go back to original Swain playrate in those roles? We don't know for sure because they didn't include it.

Also, note there is no information about what ELO these numbers are from. Swain's passive is proportionally weaker the higher ELO you go because you land fewer of his skillshots.

Even in his new ""best lane"", which is support, which his mains DIDN'T WANT, his performance in higher ELO is not good, either in winrate or playrate.

I have to assume Riot knows this, and is fine with him being a support mage in low ELO. I would have preferred some honesty with the charts, because this analysis is bullshit."
leagueoflegends,fnc7fwh,t3_g0uu9d,1586830240.0,"Yes, a Mid/Top solo lane that was ""sticky"" after his rework because the champ has a great aesthetic, and generally fun abilities, but he's been hard shoved into support role and the play rate numbers show it. 

Yes, the 0.75% of players playing him mid, almost all in low ELO, are basically one tricks and as a result have a decent winrate. This is obvious.

That isn't at all the same thing as ""if you play Swain solo lane you'll climb."" You can argue Swain is fine in support role, and if Riot is happy with him there, its where he's going to stay like other failed mages."

Initial data science research, e.g. lit reviews, paper implementations, etc. are done in notebooks with reports on findings going in docs directory, and original papers in resources. 

When a technique is ready for a production use case, the same Git repo gets Python classes in the src directory. All of the datasets are maintained in SFTP, with detailed instructions in the README on how to access, train, and evaluate. For some complex use cases that rely on numerous models in combination, a separate ground truth evaluation library is written to compare hold out data not used for training any part of the ensemble. These harnesses provide precision, recall, and F scores.

Confluence documents are written with details on the foundational research (links to papers and repositories) as well as instructions on using the library. Batch processing is run by launching the model Docker containers, while live-time inference is deployed as a Flask microservice.

All code collaboration is through internal Git/BitBucket, which is tied to Agile stories in JIRA. Some members of the team focus on research tasks, while others are more engineering focused. Acceptance criteria is defined during each 2 week period, ranging from a sample notebook, or lit review reporting, to a unit tested production deliverable."

leagueoflegends,fmftgct,t3_fuusqf,1586034489.0,"I've been thinking about this a lot recently, and I think the solution is a Free For All (FFA) game mode. League is heavily team oriented, which I'd argue leads to most of the toxicity, frustration, and rage experienced playing in SoloQ. Not only do you suffer from matchmaking problems, where you get continuously queued with turbo-inting shitters, when you are having a bad game, you feel worse because you know you are negatively impacting 4 other players, who take out their frustration on you.

I've been casually playing TFT on mobile, and realized that losing, even last place on TFT doesn't make me feel frustrated like I do in SR. Fundamentally its because 7 other players don't care that I had a bad game, and my success was based on my own play rather than feeling shackled to the inevitable 0/10 Yasuo who's spamming racial epithets.

What makes League so fun to me is the macro play, the crisp combat mechanics, and interesting build options and interplay between characters. Every game is different, so it holds my interest. What if you had a FFA map with a combination of objectives with each player responsible for farming, buying items, and contesting objective points. Full Draft rules, you get a ban, and to pick your character, tune the game so its intended to be a bit shorter than SR games are currently. With this mode you would have a faster game mode that doesn't have random champs (ARAM), and removes 99% of the cause of toxicity and frustration. I think it would be really fun and popular.

The exact number of players, and map layout would have to be played with, maybe 6 players in a star pattern each with individual lanes/turrets, or maybe a layout entirely without traditional lanes. Has Riot ever talked about investigating a FFA game mode like this?"

My covid test showed negative, but both the ER doctor and my primary care think its a false negative. Apparently the test we have has a 15% false negative rate. 

I've been in solitary isolation since Sunday, alternating tylenol and ibuprofen every 3 hours to keep the fever down and drinking water and pedialyte nonstop. I have no appetite, and hurt all over. I've had mono, pneumonia, bronchitis, and flu... this isn't like anything else I've experienced. 

Stay safe out there, you do *not* want to get this."

That's the biggest thing for me, is how much more effective I am at my job working from home without constant interruptions. I get easily 2x the work done from my home office with less stress. 

Fortunately I had already moved to 100% WFH before COVID... unfortunately I somehow got it anyway and am now extremely sick."

I get periods of extreme sound sensitivity that make even normal talking volume unbearably loud. My wife is so used to it now I just use a hand signal (lower the volume) and she immediately knows I'm sound sensitive and can hear whispers as if normal talking voice. When this happens in crowds like a busy restaurant, its agony."

politics,flfj5vf,t3_foe59d,1585107954.0,"I've been avoiding digging into the COVID-19 data, until today... it's so much worse than I think people understand. We are sailing towards a massive iceburg and the people in charge are steering right at it. 

We are going to have the highest confirmed cases of this virus in the world within 24 hours. More than China, more than Italy. That is confirmed cases despite the fact we are testing at 40x less per capita than countries like South Korea.

Current estimates show our confirmed counts are doubling every 3 days. If we follow the current trend we are going to see such a hit on our medical system it will collapse. We have ~162,000 respirators in our entire country, including military and DoD units. If current trends hold, we will have up to 10 million Americans requiring a hospital bed for COVID-19 treatments.

General estimates on COVID-19 fatality rates are 1.4% with access to facilities with respirators. The fatality rate skyrockets when you overload the medical system and those ICU beds aren't available. Worst case we could see double digit percentages of fatality rates. That is literally mass plague graves territory."

This country is going into a recession, period. Just how bad that recession is will partly depend on how badly this virus is handled. 

The US is not the first country in COVID-19s path, we've seen what happens when nations fail to respond quickly and effectively by forcing isolation. The infection rates drop, the number of treated cases stay under the red line. We fuck this up, people will be buried in mass plague graves."
