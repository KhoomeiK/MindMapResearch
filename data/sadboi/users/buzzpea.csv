ageofsigmar,fqcw3n2,t3_ghfg4f,1589270927.0,"Recently started playing and come up across a few confusing things with my team. 

Does Lady Olynder's ability Wail of the Damned override the 'within 3"" of an enemy' rule during the shooting phase? Her ability states that it applies to any enemy units within 10"" of her, but if she's already in combat with an enemy unit, does that affect her range?

Also, can the artifact of power Slitter cause enemy units to be divided? Because I get to choose who dies instead of my opponent?"

That's what's happening in the North of Italy anyway.

explainlikeimfive,fed8h32,t3_eoe7l6,1579003619.0,"Many lip balms like Carmex contain Salicylic Acid which has an exfoliating effect, along with other irritants. 

As lips don't have oil glands they are more susceptible to drying out and peeling. Harsh weather conditions and dehydration are one of the main causes of dry lips, along with licking the lips and taking certain medications.

Don't expect lip balms to fix dry lips as there is often underlying causes. Drink plenty of water and use lip balm as a barrier to protect your lips against harsh weather but avoid flavoured balms (they encourage lip licking) and avoid balms with known irritants."

My next door neighbour, an elderly Irish Catholic lady (who I was already a bit terrified off tbh), knocked on my front door one morning to tell me and my girlfriend at the time to have quieter sex. One part I remember vividly was her saying that 'the noise and moans need to be reduced. The walls are paper thin and if you fart you're gone!' Moving out of that place was a good day."

Apart from those things it honestly seems to be working well for me."

I always love the look of high end palettes but personally have never found a high end palette where I'm positive I'll use every shade. And if I'm not going to use the whole thing I can't justify the cost to myself. I may not use every shade in my drugstore palettes but it doesn't bother me if I've only paid £10. I honestly find them great to use and many of my friends in the cosmetics industry rate them highly too."

mentalhealth,erqtxcp,t3_c3cue8,1561151971.0,"Sleep anxiety/insomnia really sucks. I find that the more anxious I am the harder it is to sleep and the less I sleep, the more my anxiety grows till I can't sleep because I'm so anxious I won't be able to get to sleep. If it wasn't so awful it would be pretty funny. 

You could look into CBT and mindfulness techniques. Doing things like not looking at your phone/watching TV just before bed can help too, along with reducing your caffeine intake (and alcohol if you drink). You sound like you exercise regularly already which is great! I often put on an audiobook to distract me as I'm trying to fall asleep. 

Outside of anxiety there are other health issues that can cause insomnia so I highly recommend that you speak to your doctor about it."
