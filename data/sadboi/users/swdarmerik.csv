With that said, there is the idea that people get what they want out of something. If a person has a negative expectation of something, the event will be negative. 

I understand your thinking, when confronted with something worse than our own event, we tend to minimize our own trauma. Please be careful to not fall into that trap. Just because someone faced what you call ""worse"" trauma, doesn't invalidate your own. Trauma is what happened to us, and how we respond to it. Trauma is also subjective, meaning what may seem bad to you may not be bad for others. 

I wish you luck on your journey. If you want to experience a productive group setting I suggest finding solutions outside of your school. Also, you have more choices than you think. The trick is knowing and learning how to use recognize and use them, took me years to learn that one.  In closing, goodbye and good luck."
