That's not it. Instead of telling my parents I'd burnt my fingers, I just got an ice pack and held it while I continued making my ramen and finished it. Only an hour later did I tell anyone because I was suspiciously taking too many ice packs from the freezer. 
Got some burn cream on it and sat in front of the AC all day crying cause it hurt so bad.
