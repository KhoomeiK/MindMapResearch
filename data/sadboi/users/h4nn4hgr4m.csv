My step sister is the bread winner (salaried) a d her hubby is the caretaker (photographer, self proclaimed artist, grocery money essentially) and it works great! They also occasionally ask me to babysit my lil niece and at that point it's a win-win.

Because my aspiration is to become a gynecologist, I don't know how old I would be when I decide to have children, or if we even cross that path, but my now-boyfriend is exceptionally well at cooking, cleaning, care taking, etc, as well as he doesn't have a clear path, so I would totally be supportive if he decided he wanted to work his way up the line of seniority at a retail job.

A mutual friend introduced us, didn't get talking until the next year, which is when I developed a major crush for him. Even though I knew he had a girlfriend, you just can't control who you like. Fast forward a couple of years when I convinced him we were just friends and that I thought I had a crush but I enjoyed being friends (bc I was paranoid). We became best best friends, and that little crush going on never stopped, it only became stronger. He started to complain to me about things such as his girlfriend and his schoolwork/job. I started to trust him with things like family issues and this one prick who went for it. Aaaaaaaand his girlfriend threatened him with suicide if he didn't get back together with her. I told him to call the police on her to see if he was serious because he is the last person that could've caused it. She ended up fine, we ended up fine.

1. Lying proves that you are not trustworthy for the team, even if it is about esteem issues. If you have to lie to sound like an impressive worker, you don't deserve the spot

2. Anything she made for the team could have been put to use, and is not the company's property, since she did, after all, make it FOR them. They pay her to make what they need, it is theirs to use, she gets her paycheck problem solved. To destroy work you've made for the company is inappropriate, especially if you don't leave a hard copy and completely wipe all work you've done for them. 

In addition, a 25% increase is kind of bullshit for any position, granted I'm sure there is someone out there making that kind of money somehow some way. Incredibly inappropriate."
