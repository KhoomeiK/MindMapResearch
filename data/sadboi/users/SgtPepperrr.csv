Now, im not expecting some deep knowlege of anarchist history or theory, but I do want to see more people in this movement commited to anarchistic ways of thinking and anarchist ideas. 

Anarchists really should be very hesitant witht this kind of attitude; Anarchism has next to nothing in common with MLs, and we should definitley be thinking outside of socdem or other typical ""leftist"" boxes."
