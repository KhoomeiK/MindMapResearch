They are why we can’t have nice things, because they believe it would somehow devalue their nice things.”

Those are the last two sentences of my original post.  At no point in that post or any of the other numerous post on this subject have I blamed the GOP for the creation of or spreading of the virus...  

I have heavily criticized their handling of the situation, and their lack of commitment to their own moral system, given how frequently their leaders depart from their “values”, and I stand behind that.  In my opinion the GOP is a evil, racist, sexist organization dedicated to doing what ever it takes to keep old white men rich.  

That being said, I will admit that my “the people in charge of it should be dealt with in the most aggressive manner available.” statement was a bit over the line, and for that I will apologize.  

Overall my stance remains the same:  They are willing to ignore the warnings presented to them by experts and prematurely act for the sake of business.  This will result in a lot of preventable deaths, and they are ok with this, because it means that they get to keep making themselves and their friends rich."

More small local farms mean that money stays in a local economy more often.  The same can be said about small community stores.  Would an economy without Walmart really be that bad of a thing?

However, the resending of the order does represent the desire of the Governor and those of a similar mindset to ignore the public health risk that they have been advised of and to focus on economic gains rather than public welfare.  

It is within the rights of anyone to do as they wish as long as it doesn’t infringe on others, but as a leader it is your responsibility to direct those whom look to you for leadership and guidance in a way that benefits the whole, not the singular.  I see these actions as being reckless and immoral; people will die from this decision, but I do not have faith that the elected officials making these choices will shoulder any guilt or responsibility in the matter.  They are, in my opinion, disconnected and apathetic to the reality that most Americans live, and though not exclusive to a singular party, the most vocal of the politicians in favor of ignoring public health for the sake of “the economy” have been republicans.  They would seemingly gladly see people die so that they can get a haircut or so that multibillion dollar companies do not lose profit.  I can not support that."

I tip out of the desire to personally thank someone for their service.  It doesn’t mean that I agree with this system though, and I would much prefer to see a change made too it.  

Though for any substantial change to take place it will involve the workers making the decision that they are no longer willing to work for unfair wages, and consumers deciding that they will no longer provide business to employers who do not pay a living wage..

To clarify, I was trying to point out in my post that underpaid workers should not be disgruntled with consumers, their problem is with their employers.  That doesn’t mean as consumers we can not or should not do what we can to help one another; it just isn’t our responsibility to do so..

Similarly Americans should not be gnashing at the teeth over other Americans, with differing views or beliefs, over the state of the nation, they should be looking to their political representatives at how they have behaved and voted.  

It has become common place in our society to deflect and redirect peoples justified anger from the parties responsible to the general masses, and as such given authority to those responsible to ignore their consequences of their selfish actions.  That just doesn’t fix anything..."

Who is it that has chosen to only pay their staff $5.80 an hour?  It isn’t the customer, and frankly shouldn’t be the responsibility of the customer to provide for the business owner’s staff; that is the responsibility of the business owner.  A tip should be a bonus, a personal thank you for the extra mile that you took while doing your job; the great attitude that you presented during the transaction, or the extra little that you did to make things special.  Unfortunately employers have turned what was supposed to be a personal showing of gratitude of your actions into an excuse to under pay you and to shift blame to the consumer so that you are placated while performing your job.  The fact is that Tipping isn’t common on a global scale, because it doesn’t make since to work for someone only to be primarily paid by someone else...  It is the employers whom should be looked at to provide a basic living wage because it is then whom are looking to employee your services.  This is especially true now, as delivery is at an all time high in demand; how economic is it to leave a 20% tip on a delivery order that has an even greater chance than normal of being wrong or messed up upon delivery because restaurants have understaffed their delivery crew?  

TLDR:

It really isn’t the consumer’s responsibility to pay you, it’s your employers.  So rather than asking for tips, demand a raise.  

Tips do not equal compensation, and employers should not be able to treat them as such."
