financialaid,fm2adcb,t3_fsljod,1585693559.0,“Transferred from the IRS” is a response that the federal processors put into place after the data breach. It is there to protect student and parent tax information. Ask them if attaching a copy of tax returns will suffice :)

TalkTherapy,ev58d3r,t1_ev2qz6r,1564229425.0,"I agree with sadpanda! Yesterday in IOP we had a new girl come in and the counselor introduced her with her legal name. The person said don’t call me that, only my mom calls me that (we found out later her mom passed away). So the counselor asked what name she’d prefer. She said it but it could be spelled 3 other ways. The counselor asked which spelling and repeated it two more times to make sure. It’s different but similar to your situation and I think bringing it up would clear the air. I like how sadpanda phrased it cos it’s like hey, common mistake but really it’s this."
TalkTherapy,ev36hjn,t3_cfyj1n,1564190025.0,Today’s the best day I’ve felt in a long time. So thankful for therapy and IOP 😊😊. I’m sad I’ve only got 2 more weeks of IOP but glad that the program has given me the tools to manage my stress. I just wanted to post this somewhere 😊
TalkTherapy,eusi7wq,t1_eusepvr,1564008751.0,"I’m glad to hear too! Take it easy, friend! 💚"
TalkTherapy,etnggtw,t3_ccgvq2,1562986477.0,"That’s so awesome!! I like that he said you can have a hug whenever you like :)

At my emergency session this week we went over all the progress I’ve been making. That he’s proud of all the work I’m putting in. I was super down on myself for “falling back” so it was really nice to hear him acknowledge. Cos this shit is hard, yo. Anyway I felt compelled to ask for a hug and he said yes. I’m short too so he had to hunch down like he’s hugging a kid lol. It was nice, I’m glad I asked :)"
TalkTherapy,etlh58q,t3_ca6coi,1562936260.0,"At my last session my T was gushing about how proud he was of me I felt compelled to ask for a hug and he said yes! So we did 🥰🥰. I had to go on for an emergency session and I was really down on myself. He reminded me that I’ve made a lot of progress and that this is a marathon blah blah lol.

Also with all my progress and how I couldn’t fit him into my IOP schedule, he said that selfishly he’d want to keep meeting weekly so that we can keep up the momentum. I told him I’ve been thinking about coming back since I don’t get the one-on-ones with IOP. Also he said “selfishly” because he technically can’t make me go, but I’m glad he brought it up cos I was embarrassed to ask (cos I still think I’m weak for asking for help lmao). So I get to see him every week to work on my shit on top of IOP. Yay yay!"

TalkTherapy,eskrdqh,t1_esipzr3,1562071948.0,I want a pocket sized version of my T so i can just pull them out of my pocket and say nice things when I need them HAHAAH
TalkTherapy,esioibp,t1_esgtace,1562017321.0,"1) thank you for reminding me that it’s normal! I’m pretty sure I’ve scrubbed thru all the “transference” posts on here but somehow my brain still isn’t getting it and feeling bad about it still. I’m hoping that by talking to him about it (as per the usual responses to these types of posts) will help my brain calm down and get to that connected feeling instead 💚💚

2) I appreciate the therapist perspective! I’m definitely gonna ask him about boundaries and such. I’ve previously thought about what would happen if I randomly saw him outside of sessions but never in my imagination did I think about him seeing me drunk af and how to handle that, ahhaah! Thank you for your perspective on being vulnerable. He always says he’s proud of me when I do that and I have a feeling the next session is gonna go well since he’s always very understanding. Thank you thank you! Your response helps a lot! 🥰"

TalkTherapy,esin609,t1_esgvk5k,1562016631.0,"I appreciate your comment a lot! I’ve been having a hard time journaling and expressing my feelings/thought process so I was scared that my post wouldn’t be understood. I’m gonna see my T tomorrow about this and I think I’ll expand on this post for him to read so that I cover all my bases. 
IOP went well! Lots of paperwork and I was totally nervous but everyone was super nice! Lmk if you have any questions <3"
TalkTherapy,esimsip,t1_esh31p4,1562016444.0,YOU GET IT! UGH!! Seriously I just wanted to just go out there and have all the fun and deal with the usual hangover but boooo. Seeing him just had to have that extra sauce of shame and guilt lol. I hope we never see our T’s out in public again 🤣
TalkTherapy,esimkbk,t1_eshhato,1562016329.0,"Ahhh thank you so much for this!! Totally the same. My T did tell me that I use humor as a coping mechanism. It lines up with how I make light of all my problems, Lolol."
TalkTherapy,ersfpjm,t1_ers3hmh,1561212640.0,"omg are you me?!?! you literally put into words what i haven't been able to pinpoint as far as my crush for my T. Also we're the same age! lolol. I recently started getting over it. What's helped is that i'm having a hard time with therapy and all the past repressed feelings resurfacing so really needing to focus on myself. Looking at him thru the lens of i hired this dude to help me navigate my brain. That he wouldn't be in my life if i didn't seek counseling. also that whole therapy boundaries thing hahaha! hang in there, friend! we got this! :D"
