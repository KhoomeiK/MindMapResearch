jailbreak,fla47ya,t3_fnh7e3,1584976272.0,"I’m sorry this happened to your friend. I had the same thing happen to me in December in London: they forced me to sign out of iCloud and then erase all content & settings. To people saying that a reboot would take the phone out of a jailbroken state: a big part of this would be knowing that the restored phone would still be iCloud activation locked. While I might not get my phone back, it may deter thefts once they realise they can’t easily set the phone up"

jailbreak,fi5vlw6,t1_fi5pro9,1582171577.0,"Hey I’m not really familiar with the older versions of unc0ver as I’m on iOS 13.3. It sounds to me like it should work, it’s just another method of signing without relying on enterprise certificates.

For the VM bit I’m kind of confused - are you running Linux? AltStore works with both Windows & Macs. But yeah if you give VM full access to the USB port I don’t see why a VM wouldn’t work (so basically the host OS doesn’t interact at all with whatever you plug into the USB slot). I should add that AltStore is supposed to let you sign over Wifi but I’ve found this to be really temperamental on Windows.

The application will ask for your AppleID because it’s using it to sign the app as opposed to using the enterprise certificates from services like Reprovision etc.

Also for Windows 10 make sure you install both iTunes (from the Apple website NOT Microsoft store, & iCloud for Windows). You don’t need to do anything with them, it just installs dependencies for AltServer."

(I’m assuming you’ve already installed AltStore on your phone. If not you do it by running AltServer on your computer, plugging in your phone & selecting an option that says something like “install AltStore”)"

depression,ew1k7eg,t3_clue8y,1565025186.0,"Go on holiday my friend.  Sounds like such shitty advice but seriously go somewhere very sunny with an activity in mind (like hiking mountains).  I get very bleak and have suicidal ideations in my home country and it’s exacerbated by how grey and bleak the weather is.  This is then compounded if I don’t do anything social for a few days.  Just being in a sunny country with a dose of fresh air completely lifted my mood.  Don’t go there and stay indoors.  Go out and walk along a beach, listen to some music if you like.  I found that refreshing moments like these give me snapshots to look back on and remind myself that shit doesn’t have to be so bleak and hopeless all the time.  I wish you all the best mate"

https://forums.openvpn.net/viewtopic.php?t=11342 clearly there’s something you can do to allow reading of user/pass from a text file.  And then hopefully you can put a one liner in /etc/rc.local since there won’t be a prompt for credentials."

If the file doesn’t execute on boot there’s some workarounds here https://www.linuxbabe.com/linux-server/how-to-enable-etcrc-local-with-systemd

Also there might be a function with your client to do this already.  I just do this because my VPN’s autoconnect doesn’t always work."

I get pretty much all the way through the install process and then the installer spits out a hardware error.  From what I can tell it’s quite common.  I’ve tried using USBs with both MBR and GPT tables but neither change the error.
