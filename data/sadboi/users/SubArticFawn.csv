It's just gotten worse when I found out that the chances of me having an autoimmune disease is also high. It is impossible for me to stay completely away from the virus. There's nothing left in stores for me to sanitize with. Even hand soap is gone. My husband works at a hospital so his chances of being exposed and exposing me and our two kids is also high. We have no family to go and stay with if we had to. If he did have to quarantine and miss work, he wont get paid if he doesn't have any PTO. Two weeks of no pay means we won't be able to pay bills, feed our kids, or keep the place we stay. I hate this. I haven't had more than 4 hours of sleep a day in over a week and that's after taking something to help me sleep."

Parenting,faeg826,t1_faebs9v,1576000259.0,Which is what I'm afraid of. I'm not sure if she thinks since she's so short and small for her age mixed with not knowing how to communicate that makes her want to act out or if another student is pushing her and she just pushes back.

She's talking a lot more than she did even back before school started so I know she's getting help at school. I work with her at home too and she's (kind of) starting to understand how to be nice about asking people to get out of her way."
Parenting,fae32xd,t1_fae2uix,1575992641.0,Her language is definitely not where it should be for a three year old. That's part of why she is in special ed. Her communication and understanding is at a 2 year old level but it's getting better. I think she might not know how to communicate. She's just now getting to where she'll tell me she's hungry and/or thirsty and when she needs to potty so she's not even potty trained fully just yet.
