TheTempleOfEs,fmknqgg,t3_fvmy7z,1586161546.0,"I'm glad you got the true ending! Congrats!! its kinda weird how I came across this app, to be honest, I was trying to find an app to keep me distracted from my panic attacks, so I was going through these apps like ""Calm"" and those mental health apps so while I was browsing this came up, so I thought why not. I was pretty satisfied with my answer since it got almost all of it correct even parts on my family problems yet i kept getting bothered, something wasn't right. because Es was acting strange, she was confused and that's when i realised this app is far more than just a self-discovery app, and since i wasn't aware of it i my choices were all messed up which lead to Es becoming mad. So in my second I tried to encourage the rules and ignore impulses, though that wasn't right either because it showed that feelings do not matter and that Es has so purpose. So right now I'm redoing everything but this time I'm gonna pick the options that are in between so hopefully I can get the true ending this time!"

Once the wound starts healing, you'll feel the urge to scratch it/peel it but please try your best not to, because it will only encourage things to get in the wound. if the wound is still red/bumped after 2 weeks, try and tell your parents/doctor that a cat/dog scratched you but you didnt want to make a big deal out of it so you didnt tell them at first. usually saying a cat scratched it would be the most believable lie. please stay safe <3"
