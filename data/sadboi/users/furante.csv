https://www.amazon.com/Pedag-Orthotic-Semi-Rigid-Support-US/dp/B001E5CLQ6

 I stretch frequently and try do massage my feet after I run. But I couldn't do it without the insoles... Also, I found that Nike shoes or any shoe that has an overly pointy front makes PF come back. 
Hope this helps!"
DeadBedrooms,fmjscvi,t1_fmieh2n,1586136737.0,"We had a big talk today and I guess he was feeling disdain towards me. He usually keeps his feelings to himself and it's very hard to make him talk. I usually have to insist several times to make him confess what he's feeling...
But I guess we've been spending too much time doing everything together and he's become saturated. 
I don't think he has a porn addiction because I've even tried to watch it with him and it made him uncomfortable."

""Bringing her back just because he‚Äôs sick is telling her that going no contact was a mistake and her past behavior is no big deal""

I hadn't thought about that... That's the last thing we want. She must realize eventually that her actions were/are wrong... Although she probably never will...

Just kidding"
relationship_advice,f1fqdui,t1_f1e1e4r,1569450460.0,"""As a parent your job is to protect your kids."" this right here I told to my MIL during an argument and she simply replied ""but he is my husband"". Basically saying he is more important because he is her husband....??? I got so angry back then. She would always say like a broken record ""but he is my husband, but he is my husband(...)"". It was as if she was trying to tell her subconscious over and over again why she has to put up with him. 

Back then I was actually the one who encouraged my bf to stop talking to them. 
But I tend to overly forgive people as time passes and to feel guilty about being mad... 

I hope your partner will heal with time... And I wish you luck coping with that situation. It must be very challenging for you to face your MIL without getting extremely angry."

Never heard of that saying. It's a useful one though!

I guess you are right... I just feel bad sometimes because it looks like his mother is suffering from not talking to her son... But she kind of chose that path, I guess."

I actually went and smelled the bottle of methimazole... And you were right.
I guess we must take all this information and try to make the best decision... He's also been suffering from knee and elbow pain without doing any  form of workout... So I guess it must be methimazole side effects taking place.
Thank you so much! And no problem, more information is always better in this case."

Your initial thoughts are exactly like mine... Why remove a gland that is fine per se when the problem is in the imune system...
But I guess I can see why it is so important for some to have a thyroidectomy. 200 bpm heart rate must've felt like living hell...!
It is very weird nonetheless that some might go into remission after taking only medication for some time. Every case is so different. It's puzzling...
I hope you'll feel much better now that you've had a thyroidectomy! 
We're still trying to control it with methimazole and propranolol. In October we'll check how things evolved..."

gravesdisease,f0vacyi,t1_f0treik,1568973007.0,But don't you think that it is a bit scary to remove an entire functional gland of the body because of autoimmunity?
