I'm sorry, dude. Grieving is understandable but she may not be the same person you once knew. I can only try to imagine what it must feel like. Maybe it's time to accept it and focus on yourself?

Maybe ask him what the kiss meant/why he did that before assuming he was romantically interested? 

If he does confirm romantic interest, then break it to him.

Confirmation is always better than assumption."

LifeProTips,fbbm482,t1_fbbljma,1576703297.0,"It depends on the individual. There's no point listening and reading in French if you don't know what the words mean. But if you do know what they mean even in the slightest, you'll be practicing both, your reading and listening. However, if you do want to get familiar with the wordings, etc. you can keep the subtitles in English and practice listening which will eventually help with speaking. 

Perhaps try both and see what works for you? You can also attempt at befriending someone who is a native french speaker and chat in French."
LifeProTips,fbbl7wo,t3_ecih0l,1576702762.0,"I've seen and heard people using alot of different approaches. Some extreme enough to actually move to the location itself. E.g. you moving to France because you want to learn French. This because then you're forced and exposed to the language and culture on a daily basis so you're not limited to the basic stuff they teach in courses and apps. 

Anywho, that's not always possible for everyone. However, I've heard that watching shows, listening to music, labelling things in language you want to learn, joining groups, etc. helps to speed up the learning process. You can also try thinking your thoughts in the language you want to learn to try and make it easier. 

Usually, there are common words that are used majority of the time. They often differ depending on the language and grammar structure. A little research should help. Having those under your belt would benefit you in the long run. 

Hope that helps. Good luck."

If she is already seeing someone and seems happy, it's likely that she was already getting detached. Should explain why the breakup didn't affect her as much as it did to you. 

Relationship is a two way thing. You can't just give or take. If you lose someone who isn't putting in the work required, you're not really losing anything as they weren't really doing anything in the first place. 

Apologies if it seems too direct. Rejections, breakups, etc. are a part of life. Don't take it too hard. Appreciate while things last and welcome what's to come. 

If you feel like venting, feel free to hit me up. If not, that's cool too. Have a good one."
