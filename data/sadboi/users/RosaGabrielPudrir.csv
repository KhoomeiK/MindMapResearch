It took my family a year or two to get back in the swing of things, and it was especially hard for my dad. We moved past the event through counseling/therapy and by forcing ourselves to get out of the house every once in awhile. My main advice for you is to be there for your mom. That was her lover, her closest friend, and the father of her offspring. It's like she lost three people all at once. You two absolutely need to work as a unit through this and be there for eachother through the hardship. Acknowledge that different people grieve differently. Catharsis can come from many things, whether it's crying, finding a new hobby, or venting like you just did.

It was traumatizing and the last thing they found in her search history was ""is there a god?""

This was a few years ago but reading your post reminds me so much of how awful the situation was. I sincerely hope your family makes it through this. My best advice is to take grief therapy very seriously even if it seems stupid. I'm so sorry for your loss. Please get help while you can to move past this tragedy, the last thing I want is for grief to consume you and for you to end up like him.

schizophrenia,fo8299q,t1_fo7rpwg,1587588619.0,"I have had a *somewhat* similar experience to you so hopefully this little confession will make you feel less alone with what you felt. This specific hallucination has stopped for a few years now, but it was kind of similar to what you described. It was one of the first hallucinations I ever had and it reoccured for about three years. While I'm a female, I saw a male who wasn't quite like me but dressed very similar. He was mostly auditory and sometimes visual (never tactile though from what I remember). He was tall, slender, brown-haired and wore a lot of striped long-sleeved shirts. To me, what gave away his inhumanness was his reddish eyes when I first saw him. Nobody has that color as far as I'm aware. I was obviously terrified when he began speaking to me because I held the delusion that he was some sort of demon when I was still a religious person. I was obsessed with the afterlife and his red eyes scared the holy fuck out of me. I was undiagnosed at the time (was only diagnosed earlier this year) so it was the only explanation I could think of. As it turns out, he was a separate form of myself. I too would look in the mirror and feel uneasy if I was dressed too much like him. I was scared if I said something that sounded too much like something he would say. He wasn't very pleasant like yours was though. He appeared to be a manifestation of every bad part of myself. Jealousy, anger, hatred, and anything that was negative that gave me adrenaline. He was an abusive asshole to me and caused SEVERAL relationships to end. He'd force me to send death threats to friends, crushes and girlfriends and if I didn't comply he'd threaten ME instead. Someone even went as far as to threaten calling the police on me but thankfully didn't follow through.

It was nice seeing someone like you also experienced hallucinating some version of yourself in the opposite sex in a reoccurring manner. I've never met anybody else with an experience even remotely close. Thank you for sharing your experiences"

Couples counseling sounds like the way to go and seeing as we both go to therapy individually already (different reasons) the idea of more assistance with this topic isn't too far fetched.
