And exhausting (will cry unless held in a specific position). As others have said, it's hard for dads to feel bonded--we don't have the benefit of the hormone cocktail mom gets during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Having a challenging kid makes it all the harder. Hang in there, and don't be so hard on yourself. The fact that you show up for your son is was makes you a good dad."

therapy,eohm4uy,t3_brwe9t,1558585332.0,"As a therapist and frequent therapy-goer, I'm really sorry you had a crappy first experience. Like other people have said, therapy is often really hard. And when your first time really sucks, it can really be traumatizing. Feel proud of yourself for even considering going back, that's an act of courage and self-love. Go you. 

I hope it goes better this time. It really does often come down to the therapist you get. If they're not a good fit with your personality, or if they're not the best in the world (plenty bad therapists exist, unfortunately), it likely won't go well. It's discouraging, it's painful, it's tiring. Keep looking. Finding a good therapist can be a life-changing thing, and you'll thank yourself for it. 

Some tips on finding a good therapist: 

- Ask friends and family. You'll be surprised to learn how many people you know go to therapy. At least a handful, for sure. Lots of people just feel self-conscious about talking about it, but if you ask they'll encourage you

- look online. There's probably a subreddit for your town on here where you could ask for recommendations. There might even be an online community for this kind of thing in your area. Post on Facebook if you have to. 

- ask lots of questions. In the intake the therapist will ask tons of questions, but it's a great idea to ask them questions too. What kind of techniques do they use? What counseling theories do they agree with? What's their counseling philosophy? They might be thrown off a little--people almost never ask me these kinds of questions, but I wish they would. If they say something over your head, write it down and look it up when you get home. This can help you know if their style is going to work for you.

- don't give up. Sometimes it takes longer that it should.


Hope this is helpful. Good luck!"
psychotherapy,eohk8x1,t1_eoh9pmw,1558583818.0,"I didn't read that so much as an argument against using evidenced-based therapy, but more the suggestion that the demand for showing evidence of progress (by insurance companies, but also from clients as you mentioned) often leads agencies and therapist to be too rigid on what modalities they use. They tend to prefer modalities that make it easy to track outcomes, and CBT is a great modality for showing outcomes (lots of scaling, homework, etc). There's nothing wrong with this as a part of your practice, but it seems to me that over-emphasizing "" specific outcomes"" can often get in the way of building rapport and helping the client come up with and work on ways of making lasting change."
Pete_Buttigieg,eoa6cxa,t1_eo9k4h9,1558408376.0,"I like the idea of spending a few years after high school doing service work before entering the workforce and then being rewarded with free college. Imagine a whole generation growing up like this, with the idea that working hard for your community is expected and highly valuable to the world and also to you personally. That's a future I'd be proud to hand my kid. i agree that there should be stipulations about what counts, but they should be flexible to encourage creativity and critical thinking. If you have an off the whole approach and you can make a sound argument why it'll help society, knock yourself out."
