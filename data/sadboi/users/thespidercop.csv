But at least one final look at the character that we all fell in love and grew up with, even if it was for a few seconds, maybe a recap or an epilogue of simmering the last events of Revenge of the Sith 
and then time jump into the scene with Darth Vader and leave it as that 
Either way I'm happy with what Dave Filoni came up with, he's the goat :-)"

clonewars,fp5a5s3,t3_gbe7vs,1588321735.0,"I hope for the finale, we get an epilogue and montage of very short scenes of Revenge of the Sith, but in Clone Wars styles. Sort of time jumps in between with Ahsoka narrating, sort of like how the Ahsoka Novel explains her pain when thinking of the Jedi Purge. Show glimpses from Obi-Wan recording the message for all the Jedi after Order 66, to the Emperor battling Yoda, to Anakin vs Obi-Wan, to Darth Vader and the Emperor side by side watching the death star being built, and to Obi-Wan delivering Luke on Tatooine, then end the show with Ahsoka and Rex going into exile. I know it's a long shot, and I think it'd be cool, 
But whatever Dave comes up with, I'm sure it'll be great."

StarWarsBattlefront,fovlkmb,t1_foviszm,1588103375.0,"There was a bug going on around 3 am pst, where characters like Anakin and Obi Wan were locked and unusable for certain players in HvV.

However, other players were able to use them just fine even though on our screens, they're shown as locked"
StarWarsBattlefront,fotxnk8,t3_g9kt3p,1588069792.0,Locked for me too. I saw someone tho on HvV just right now playing as a Count Dooku in Bespin. Not sure what's going on

We've talked before, but hotdamn, my self doubt and fear gets the better of me, and I feel like I won't even get with her at all. We may be young, but it makes me feel ill be forever alone too. Heck, plenty of people on here that have said they're 27, 30, etc. alone and such, and it makes me feel like I'll be like that too, and honestly, I'm scared of ending up the same way.

AskReddit,et82w0o,t1_et7rtwq,1562545009.0,"It ain't all that bad man. I crushed on this pretty cool girl back in high school, she was bisexual and dated this one guy for a pretty long time. After they broke up, I tried to make my move, but she wanted to take a break with guys for awhile. When the next season of Cross Country began, I crushed on this other girl, but was too shy to make moves. When senior year began, both girls that I crushed on ended up dating each other. 2019 and they're still with each other. I'm happy for them, but like I said, your situation ain't all that bad. 
Then after high school when I began working at a retail store, I crushed on my coworker whom I thought was great, but had red flags all over. We are the same age, and she seemed straight because of the way she'd always talk about guys and such. She rejected me of course in the end, but no one would've really guessed her to be lesbian.
Now in 2019, I just found out that she came out of the closet and is currently dating a girl today. Good for her I guess, glad things didn't work out?"
