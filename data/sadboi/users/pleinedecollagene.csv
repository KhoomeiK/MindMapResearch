I think theres something similar here, however there WAS logic to covering up the death in this case. One or both parents were on drugs, something happened to the poor baby and covering it up was a better option than admitting their baby died while they were off their faces on drugs."

Anyway, one night the teachers were all out in the garden having their down time. Us kids were meant to have our own floor, any other guests were downstairs and were told they aren't allowed on the second floor.

A grown arse man decided to not only go upstairs but to open our door that a Fanta bottle was propping open. At first we thought he might be working but he started saying weird shit in broken English and coming near us so me and my room mates screamed. He was gone in a second and our teachers came up. We never knew what happened but they told us he wouldn't bother us again. The teachers took shifts on chilling outside after that.

OP, my friend was with a guy for 13 years, from 20 to 33. They had a house together, just bought a 30k car and had a dog. She was miserable for the last 5 years of the relationship, he was drinking every night, shouting at her, putting her down, never wanted to go out, never wanted to meet her friends, didn't want to see her family;y. They occasionally had sex when he tried it on and she went with it. Myself and our mutual friend thought he was a waste of space and that she should leave him but in her mind she was in too deep. He was all she knew, she'd been with him most of her life, what else could she do?

In the end he left her for another woman. My friend lost her house, her man, her new car and her much beloved dog. She was depressed for a couple of months. About 6 months after she was a bridesmaid at our mutual friends wedding and she met one of the guests.

They've now been together 2 years, been on about 12 holidays, he actively involves her with his family and gets involved with hers and at New Year he proposed. She was happier in the first 6 months than she was for the majority of her old relationship where everything was set.

My point is, are you with him because you're happy and truly love him? Or because he's just all you know and you're scared of life without him?"

UnresolvedMysteries,ffngxkz,t1_ffneex0,1580065811.0,"I wasn't comparing anything? I simply said a boy like Andrew wouldn't last long trying to survive alone in London. I'd say the same about Manchester or Birmingham or Glasgow if he'd gone to one of those cities.

I think you misunderstood my point. By streets, I literally meant living on the streets, not just walking down them lol. Some people think he started a new life, and with his limited funds and age, where would he be living? Plus he looked like a kid. There are plenty of police and charities patrolling that know the homeless communities, drifters etc. He would have been picked up pretty quickly if he had run away to start a new life in the big smoke. If that had been his intention then I think someone would've taken advantage of him almost straight away."

UnresolvedMysteries,fflj2nb,t1_ffkaedr,1580040271.0,"I've commented before I fully believe he met someone over the summer holidays and continued seeing them when he went back to school which explains why he stopped getting the bus. He was meeting them after school, walking with them or getting a lift. 

This person convinced him to bunk off school and meet him in London for a day out (person was already down there) and said he'd bring him home. To me, this his case is sadly just another case of a child being groomed, and something bad happened to him.

The idea of him running away and starting a new life just isn't realistic IMO. He might have been book smart but you need to be street smart to survive on the streets of London, and Andrew just wasn't."

LegalAdviceUK,ffcmd6q,t1_ffcddma,1579802516.0,"I used to work for an organisation tracking NEETs and supporting them into EET. Most LAs contract the work out to third parties and you'd be surprised how many school leavers are unaccounted for.

Where I worked we got lists from college's/training providers etc which updated the vast majority with destinations after school. There were still thousands without a destination which we had to manually track (phone calls, letters, home visits). Even after this there are still many you can never get in touch with and have to mark them as unknown (obviously we try to keep this number as low as possible but it's inevitable you'll have unknowns). Realistically the only penalty for NEETs is that child benefit will be stopped. Point being it's quite possible OP under his real name was an 'unknown'. I was thinking more about the college pulling funding for this fake identity, I'm presuming there was a flag on the fake details and that's how he got caught."

OutOfTheLoop,feveg18,t1_fevawos,1579396461.0,"Rubbish. The media have never referred to her as a savage. She's been criticised because she, along with Harry, have gone against tradition many times and theres an element of having their cake and eating it, as well as massive hypocrisy (eg preaching about climate change whilst taking several private jets within days/week).

By marrying into the RF you have 3 jobs: produce babies, don't ever embarrass the Firm and do as you're told. Kate is very good at this and had been preparing for the role for years (remember the nickname Waity Katie?). Meghan on the other hand doesn't understand her role. It's not hers to shape, she's supposed to do as she's told. Honestly I don't think she knew what she was getting into and now she's realised she's noped out. Harry has been looking for an excuse for years."
