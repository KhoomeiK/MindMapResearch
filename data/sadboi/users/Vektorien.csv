I think Kill la Kill's biggest strength is that the show uses that aspect of itself in a self-conscious and diagetic way that ties itself into the story's main aspects. The whole show revolves around clothing so obviously half and fully naked people will be there and the characters themselves are aware of it and treat it like just another part of life.
