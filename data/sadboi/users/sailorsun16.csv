So if you feel like you need the push of being cut off from your friends to force yourself to make friends it may be worth it.
Comparing me who mainly still hangs out with old friends has probably made like 2-3 new pals in my first year to my friend who lives on campus and has a whole new group of friends I’d say it definitely does affect stuff. 
However if you’re kind of a social butterfly good at making friends it may be easier and in that case off campus may be more worth it.

7. I try to use the Aztec secret Indian healing clay mask with apple cider vinegar every week or so
