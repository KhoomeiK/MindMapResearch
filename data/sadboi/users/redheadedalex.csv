First of all, don't feel embarrassed by your emotions, EVER.  Emotions are truth, and shame has no place when you're assessing your own truth.  I get the ""extreme emotions"" part, and I get feeling shame over it.  When it comes to eights, I can only speak for myself but let me quote twenty one pilots with ""you don't get thick skin without getting hurt.""  Whatever we do to look strong, there is a very pained, hurt, scared and lonely inner child in there somewhere that caused the strength to emerge.  Everybody adapts different armor, eights seem to be conditioned at a very young age to act not-as-children.  The vulnerability that we don't often show and the innocence we break our necks to protect is, in a way, us being that strong protector that we didn't have.  

I'm only saying this to maybe dismantle the one-sided ""they're indestructible madlads!"" vibe that people seem to get--both here from 8's, and from literally everyone who knows me irl who thinks I'm just a simple badass bitch with no depth (jokes on them, I don't show it to them and prefer they think so of me) 

Anyway, my BFF is a 4 and not only do I empathize a lot with 4's, I think had things maybe been easier in early childhood I would've ended up a 4.  The deep, intense emotion and the creative and lonely and expressive tendencies are there, I could never be so up front with mine but I love when others are.  4's are special and I've heard that 8/4 friendships can go horribly but I've only ever had good experiences.  

There's a weird paradox about eights and emotions.  We're always going on about how others need to be more open and strong and to accept their feelings and live with them the way we do--suck it up and deal with it-- but then we get this perception about us that we hide our feelings or aren't in touch with them.  I think for eights and fours, emotions are like living with horrendous toothaches---they don't go away, we just function through them.  Eights just do it impassively, and fours do not."
Enneagram,fqwzxhx,t3_gkzf6h,1589722402.0,"Didn't know I had ADHD until I was 30, didn't know I was an 8 until I was 32.  So YES, hard relate.  I just always thought I was ""too abrasive"" or that everyone else was a bunch of pussies.  I mean, the truth is somewhere on the middle ground on both of those, lol.  

All my life I've heard that I'm too intense, or too angry, or too scattered or not grounded enough blah blah blah.  Adderall helps immensely when it comes to executive function and motivation, and I use my intense energy to fill in the gaps, learning a lot of ways to cope, therapizing and attempting to bE vUlnErAblE (I hate it and want no part of it) and basically just accepting that I'm just enough outside the bell curve of normal to have to run to catch up to everyone else just walking.

Enneagram,fqwquw0,t3_gl0a4w,1589714519.0,"mmmm I lived it as a kid, unfortunately.  My parents were extremely controlling, my dad was an 8 as well, but SO hilariously unhealthy and abusive and just...crazy.  

Then I ended up in the foster care system where control is ONLY exerted to the level that assists the system, not the child.  And I'm in a different foster home every few months, so I'm being controlled by a new stranger, usually psychopathic, and usually one who has zero interest in me as well.  

So, LIVING in a situation where others are in charge of everything I do.  Whether or not I can leave, whether or not I can drive, whether or not I'm good or bad, whether or not I deserve to go to college, what possessions and hobbies I can have, what I can wear, what I can say.

edit--oh I forgot, all of this surrounded by the vulnerable population being mistreated, forgotten, abused, and hurt, and there is NOTHING, not a GODDAMN thing I can do about any of it.

My brother, a 2, jumps toward my toddler son to make sure he was okay.  My husband, a 5, has zero reaction at all, and me, an 8, starts shouting at the top of my lungs like I'm trying to outdo him.

Enneagram,fqwq47q,t3_glamb5,1589713757.0,"I can't speak for fives since I'm an eight, but we'll say I'm a very 'fiveish' eight, and I married a five (and most of my deep close friends are fives.)  

The aloofness you mention does indeed seem to be common from what I witnessed.  Even when my husband WAS close with his family it was very 'surface level' on his part.  He hung out with them and seemed to do it more for tradition or just because, with them pushing the socialization.  He always seemed slightly irritated or checked out during/after.  My best friend has very loving, involved parents and when we visited for Christmas he was polite and ""himself"" but seemed really eager to go home after because it was too much socializing and people time.  

There is something about fives that just makes you want to reach in and get more, (at least, for me) and I think parents especially feel that because to have a five child when other children aren't fives really draws attention to that gap.  I guess it may also swing the other way, that the family sees them as an outcast or weirdo.  I think either typecasting that person as such, or doing what my husband's super mormon family does and trying to FORCE the closeness, is very trying for a five.  You probably know better than me that it only seems to repel them further.  I think a) parents who are sometimes stuck in the 'you're my baby' mentality for decades and b) our generation's parents, boomers and gen xers who have caused generational trauma due to their shitty power trips and c) insecure people in general often don't know how to appreciate the five as the truest, most independent people who not only require space, but have no problem taking it, or telling you that they will take it and may not care if it hurts anyone else.  

Not saying that your family is any of the above, I just see it among friends and with myself.  As I said I'm a very fiveish eight, and my full sister is a five.  I've learned that my ""I just want peace/left alone"" is partially out of fear of being controlled (because I was my entire childhood) and partially because I really do just enjoy being alone and focusing on the quiet introspection or time with a hobby, book, education, and so on.  When I am able to be alone that much I do end up missing others.  I have a hard time expressing it, but I've noticed that even a five when left alone will come back around looking for slight interaction, just after a V E R Y long time.  Longer than anybody else can probably stand, haha.  

It may be that you don't have enough time and distance between your family and yourself to have a healthy relationship, if that makes sense.  The requirements seem to be confidence and security on their end--they have to believe that you care, that you're okay, and not try to change you.  I do notice that fives, whether they have very high, medium, or low self esteem, respond verrrrrrrrrrry poorly to needy or commanding people, and that includes parents/siblings.  If your parents do like my husband's and basically shit talk him for not being ""family oriented"" (ie, religious and churchy) then, well, that might limit success.  

On your end, you probably need a LOT of space and time and distance to allow that ""I miss you"" feeling to creep in.  And then you'll have to act on it, and let them know that you value and are thinking of them.  I have never had a five particularly jump for joy when I'm around and in their heads, and that includes my partner.  I've often said if living apart was a feasible thing I'd probably attempt it in our marriage since it really draws us together when we are around each other.  So don't downplay the effect that living with them probably has.  I love and miss my own family, but I also purposely moved 2k miles away, and that's not even the farthest I've gone haha."

You guys have such a hate boner for Paige. She pissed me off too last year, ok? 

I gave up on her until she came back and started doing a few non beauty channel related videos. 
Even before jeffree pmed her she was onto bigger and more interesting content after saying that she was over reporting on beauty channels, but did it for views and money.

But she came outright with the fact that he was trying to manipulate her and what you guys are missing with your ""kArMa hunnie"" ""I saw this coming"" uselessness is that her going public is a HUGE win for those assault survivors who have named jeffree as compliant. It's also a huge ""remove the filter"" moment for jeffree in general. Most of what we see are his own ridiculous tweets and words. Not a lot of people show the behind the scenes manipulation and sinister way he uses people.

So please stop focusing on Paige for a second here and focus on the overall message. Jeffree is FANTASTIC at manipulation and he's FANTASTIC at making other people look like the bad guy. 

Can we acknowledge that Paige got manipulated, yes she's an adult, yes, she's said shitty things, doesn't change the fact that this CLEARLY shows she was used. Let's take the opportunity to focus on the fact that JEFFREE is going into silencing territory after his most recent attempt at manipulation failed.

I wouldn't even make this comment if there was a shred of proportionate anti Jeffree comments, but all you catty asses can do is smugly diss Paige.

others going into the dark side? Yeah right bud good luck. My twos are my sacred ones though. They're too good. (and I'll throw in a few of my fours into the too good pile)

I guess I'm just saying I feel you."

I think at least for me the recognition of the two ways it can swing, depending on me cooling down or firing up, really allows for personal growth. I didn't even know I was angrier than most people before learning about the Enneagram.   Now I can more appropriately activate the anger and not look clownish.  though I come off as more ""fanged"" pennywise when I'm really gunning for it....lol

It's not a perfect system but lets just say court ordered anger management didn't cut it, only now am I learning healthy ways to be me. And me will always be a bit of an angry clown. I like that the Enneagram explains and validates all sides of it."
