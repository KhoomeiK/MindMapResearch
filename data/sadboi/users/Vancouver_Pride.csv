Advice,fjz1a3g,t1_fjyyqk2,1583709089.0,"Depending on how much longer you have until you graduate,  it might be in your best interest to just  finish your degree. Try taking that break first and see how you feel. It might not seem like much, but taking a break from stressful environments can do wonders . 

And just a side thought. I know figuring out a career and life path can be extremely stressful, but just remember that there's more to life than just work. Obviously it's important, but life can take so many different turns that you never know what your future will be like. Keep doing things that make you happy and try to take advantage of any good opportunities that come your way. 

The first step is believing in yourself (no matter how cheesy it sounds). I wish you all the best in life. Cheers :)"

mentalhealth,feg4xz9,t3_e6fjrz,1579077112.0,"This is an old post but I thought I'd respond because I can relate with how you're feeling. Maybe try volunteering with animals (if you're comfortable around them) like at a shelter. You'd spend most of your time caring for/cleaning up after the animals and it could be a good way to ease yourself into being more social as it's mostly independent work. Once you get more comfortable you could even chat up the people coming in to view the animals. This could really help you with practicing to start conversations or answering questions as an animal shelter is a very natural environment for people to do so.

Another volunteer idea could be environmental work, which again is more done alone but still has social aspects for you to work on talking with people.

I wish you all the best :)"

Advice,f9pfy1g,t3_e6cvps,1575534032.0,"Going to a new school can be really tough. It makes sense that you're going to feel intimidated the first few weeks, maybe even months, that you're there. Start by just taking small steps in meeting people. Maybe chat up the person you sit next to in a class or your whoever is next to your locker. If you have a hobby or play sports, then join a school club/ team. Nothing brings people together more than common interests.

Just remember, everyone is new to you but you're also new to everyone else. They're probably curious who you are amd where you're from. They might not seem interested in getting to know you, but that's just because they're used to how things are. Dont be afraid to introduce yourself even if others already have a group of friends. Try not to worry if you dont make friends right away. These things can take time. In the meantime, try your best to put yourself out there and keep an open mind when meeting people. I hope everything works out for you and best of luck!"

I feel you though on how hard it is to socialize with people. I prefer talking organically with others too. Try to go out of your comfort zone amd put yourself in new situations where you could meet people. Maybe chat up the barista or sign up for a meetup, do a class at your community center or pick up a new hobby. There's lots of people out there looking for friends, its just a matter of opening up and finding eachother."

You shouldn't have to hold yourself back because you know your friend likes you. I understand if you want to be considerate of her feelings, but dont feel guilty for just acting in the moment. You were having a fun night and kissed someone because it felt right. It's not really your responsibility to hold yourself back because of how your friend might feel. She needs to understand that you have your own life and can choose to kiss whomever you like. Yeah maybe kissing someone else in front of her wasnt the most considerate thing to do, but you're not a bad friend for doing it. I know you feel shitty about what happened but dont beat yourself up too much."

Advice,f8ii8da,t3_e0wf7s,1574589131.0,"Well first things first, what you texted her was a really mature response. It's good you didnt get mad at her, but instead just let her decide what to do. From what you've wrote, it seems like maybe she is interested in getting to know this other guy better. So much so that she was willing to  cancel with you to go with him. Maybe she sees you as just a friend amd would rather go with someone she is interested in romantically? There's really no way of knowing unless you ask her. As for you, I'd say let her go with the other guy. She seems to still care about your feelings as she said she was willing to cancel, but I think thats just out of her being kind. I know this situation could feel like a burn, but take it in stride. Good on you for even asking her in the first place. What she did was a tad rude as you did ask first, but she handled it in the nicest way possible so she didnt really do anything wrong. Just take it in stride"
Advice,f8if3rh,t3_e0vxei,1574587911.0,"Imo, you should tell her how you feel. Especially since  you reconnected again, this is your chance. She might not feel the same way, but at least then  you'll be able to find some closure. Of course telling her is a risk, but if your friendship is true than you'll both be able to move past it. This kind of situation can be tough, but sometimes just saying how you feel is the best in the end. It will be hard telling her how you feel, but it sure beats having to feel jealous or hurt everytime she talks about other guys. 

I wish you luck and I hope everything works out!"
Advice,f8ibrbt,t3_e0vz8e,1574586860.0,"I've been feeling this way lately as well. I want to feel motivated, but actually doing shit feels impossible. What I've been doing lately, and it seems to be working (fingers crossed), is to just do one thing. Shower or brush my teeth, just anything to get me out of bed. From there I try to do just another one thing. Maybe make something to eat or do a small chore like wipe the counters down. I try and do one small thing at a time. Eventually I get the energy to do bigger things, like take my dog out or do a larger chore. By just starting off doing one small thing, I keep myself in motion and it makes doing the harder things much easier. Start small, and if that's too hard than start smaller. Even little steps are still in the right direction. I've been trying to start every day like this amd I think its working for me. I've actually even started going to the gym again. 

I hope this strategy helps. I know how hard feeling this way can be. I wish you the best :)"

From what you've said and you're responses, I'd say there's no harm in exploring the possibility of liking girls. I know it can be a little weird to think of yourself as possibly liking girls especially if you've never considered it before, but dont worry. It's good to learn new things about yourself. Sexuality is a complex thing so dont feel like you need to label yourself as anything. Have fun exploring your sexuality even if you are still committed to someone. You dont need to have sex with a girl to figure out if you are attracted to them. Explore this side of you and see what comes of it. I wish you all the best :)"

The one remark that I do have to make, and only because I cant believe you aren't understanding, is that getting a whiff of marijuana odor or walking past someone smoking a joint does in fact not equal to hotboxing in some guys car. Yes you can get high by taking in smoke but you need a much larger quantity than you will get standing on the sidewalk. If you were a real stoner as you say you were, you  would know this. Just cause you took one puff off  a joint back in 1972 dosnt mean you know everything about ""weed culture"".

I understand if the smell bothers you; that's why most smokers in general try and be discreet to not disturb anyone around them. Not liking the smell is one thing, but saying that it will go in your body is just misinformation. Does the scent of a single cigarette puff give you cancer? No, because that minute amount of smoke (especially if its only a smell rather than a smoke cloud) does nothing to the body."
