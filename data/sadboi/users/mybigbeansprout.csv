BPD,fpjmit3,t3_fzf1fn,1588674056.0,"Yes! Very much so! We could all benefit from a good conversation a day! Everything is so confusing right now, I feel like the only thing keeping me sane is other borderlines just telling it how it is. This time is so weird, and i feel like I’m not alone in saying that this time (with bpd) is just soooo much more traumatic than it has to be. One month in, I feel like my head is on fire. Like no matter what, it’s all too much. Is anyone else experiencing this during lockdown/COVID19?"
Eyebleach,fny63ts,t3_g4cjia,1587354326.0,What does HE LOOK LIKE NOW!?
BPD,flmf50k,t1_flm6kct,1585281926.0,I love this!
BPD,flmco94,t1_flmcdqi,1585280075.0,Np dude! Let me know how it goes :)
BPD,flmc53s,t3_fpdulj,1585279683.0,"OH DAMN. Okay, not all hope is lost. Have you considered a darker color? You could even use something temporary until hair salons open up again! I’ve heard that going over the yellow parts again with bleach can lighten it up (but also yikes, hair damage) Definitely try some purple shampoo, which I’m pretty sure you can still get at grocery stores until everything tones up to match better."
BPD,flmbbr8,t1_flmb7e8,1585279093.0,GOOD. Now go get you some purple shampoo and you’ve got a “haute” new look! :D
BPD,flmb5p3,t1_flkqr7h,1585278970.0,"Yep. Now I’m stuck with two large scars on my arm, now everyone and their sister asks what they’re from. My excuse is translucent bullshit. Please don’t do it."
BPD,flmayr0,t3_fpdulj,1585278831.0,"1) I completely feel that feel.
2) please don’t shave off your eyebrows, you don’t know how you’re going to feel afterwards. I’ve cut HORRIFIC front bangs/over plucked my eyebrows when I was emotional (why do BPDs do this?) and it made whichever terrible emotion I was feeling at that moment just last longer as I was reminded of my impulsive behavior every time I looked in the mirror.
3) your eyebrows will grow in funky afterwards and they will be a bitch to upkeep afterwards.
4) try something less permanent/non destructive. I keep several bottles of temporary pink hair dye under my sink for times like these. Not only do you get the satisfaction of drastically changing your look, but fun colors can be uplifting!
I hope whatever you’re going through right now if short lived ❤️ dm me if you ever need someone to talk to."
BPD,flg06j4,t3_fojeey,1585124924.0,"I felt every bit of this post. You are so not alone. I always hate when people tell me that, because it does no one in the world can understand how you feel right now. If you need someone to talk to please don’t hesitate to DM me! You are so much stronger than this illness. Not at all worth giving up a lifetime of opportunity that you’ve yet to see!❤️"
BPD,flfuddk,t1_flf51pa,1585118136.0,"Thank you! You make a very good point, ground rules should have been set in place. 
And it is the gf, the bf has had his cousin over at the house and nothing was said, so it’s seems like I’m getting the “new guy” treatment.
I’m still going to apologize just because this COVID scare has a lot of people acting differently. 
I am so appreciative of your advice! I wouldn’t have considered to bring up the fact that there weren’t ground rules set. Thank you so much for replying! And I hope the best for you in this wild time!"
