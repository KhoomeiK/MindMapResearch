The obvious is that, yes, it is unfair that your step kids don’t get the same experiences that you’re daughters do but it’s not like it’s you’re parents that are giving them this experience, and excluding the kids that “adopted” as your own. It’s your deceased wife’s family. They aren’t entitled to this treatment.

Would your current wife and kids feel the same way if you’d broken up with your daughter’s mother and she was still alive? Or do they feel entitled to the same treatment because the grandparents are still included in your life because they’re their dead daughter’s children?

You shouldn’t take this away from your kids, but you need to let your step kids know that if it was your parents giving them these experiences they would be entitled to them as well."

The other reasons were along the lines of: 
“Bringing back sovereignty”
“BringIng back control”
And “controlling the borders”

When we’ve always had that, in fact we had more of that before Brexit and now that we have to make trade deals which are not as beneficial to us as before we’ve had to sacrifice it all, and our health"
AmItheAsshole,fj1ygwa,t3_fawh0s,1582930650.0,"NTA. Anna is the AH, but I think you know this. You and John should see if you can contact Sam to discuss college with him and see if he was even made aware that Anna has demanded money from John in the first place.

Sit down with John and discuss your feelings on why you don’t want him to pay so much money for Sam’s tuition. 

Chances are his relationship with John has been poisoned by Anna, so you’ll need to treat this lightly and try to not “poison” his relationship with her even though he totally needs it.

If John is giving the money directly to Anna, I can guarantee that Sam is not seeing a penny."

A year and a half later I’m one of the most respected people of the company especially with the IT staff.

I believe this is mostly due to starting at the same time and persevering for so long. I’m also the one who stands between the team and the boss since I’ve dealt with hostile work environments in previously jobs."

If you watch the interviews on morning TV the day of the results you’ll see the people who voted for the Tories say “Well he’s the only one who’s going to get Brexit done.”

And the majority of the  North felt so disconnected from Corbyn that they voted for other people. It disgusts me how close the Tory and Labour vote was in my constituency. The same people who voted Tory were also the ones to tell people of my generation to never vote Tory because they only care about how much money they can steal from the North."

Smaller brands usually have a marketing team of one, so they may not have a list of influencers who they can use as brand ambassadors so this will help if the brand is making enough money to do this.

Hopefully we don’t have to add on “but no means no”."
