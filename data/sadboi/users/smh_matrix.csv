NoFapCatholics,fdp5psz,t3_emd3tu,1578620612.0,"Amazing job. This truly is a fine line and its difficult to walk with the pword's place in society. Perhaps talk to him about the dangers of the beast that he is dealing with. Everywhere on the internet you will find people helplessly addicted to the pword. There are an endless list of negative side effects including mental illness. Perhaps even share a TedTalk on the subject- there are few found with a quick Google search. I find it would have been helpful to me at young age if I understood why- beyond a religious/moral/philosophical reason, pword use and self stimulation is bad. Its scientifically proven and highly addictive, a legal drug. Also don't feel bad, parents are meant to protect their children from harm. Telling your kids that drugs are harmful is just that."

Finally, the food in which the author consumes is also revealed. The food in question being ""oatmeal"" (Author 89).

Here's the thing. You just have to take a step out of the moment. Out of the current situation. All the anger and the self pity you feel right now, will it matter in a month? In a year? In two years? All those worries you have right now, in grand scheme of things don't matter at all.

AskReddit,euc2hln,t3_cflyop,1563663265.0,"Started working out a couple months ago and I am still quite a novice. On my leg days I was doing squats all wrong. Bending my knees ans crouching my back. This guy at my gym who is a personal trainer (not mine he just works there) stopped me after my workout and showed how to properly do them. It felt discouraged as I was apparently doing them wrong for a long time. From then on I practiced at home and made sure my form was perfect. I had leg day at the gym this morning and after I finished up I went to the changing room. The personal trainer guy barges in and says ""Great form on your squats today. Really good. Your ass is going to kill tomorrow!""
