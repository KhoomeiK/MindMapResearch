Anxietyhelp,fa9uj87,t3_e86q71,1575892426.0,"I was in the same situation as yours 2 months ago. And the way that helped me is find someone to talk with through the night, usually a stranger. Ask them politely whether they have time to listen to you or not, then just go ahead man.
I think our problem is we need to share, we need someone who listens to our mess without judging. So a stranger is (maybe) a good choice for me."
