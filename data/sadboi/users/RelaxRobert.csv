Think of it from a news producer's standpoint. What's a ""sexier"" story: young person recovers from common mild symptoms, or young person dies from very rare case?

They're just straight up not reporting on mild cases and recoveries, because that doesn't get them traffic. Tom Hanks is  the only major story about someone having a mild case that I can think of, but he's only getting the media attention precisely because \*he's Tom Hanks\*. They aren't gonna do stories on regular everyday people who have mild cases and get over it.
