Three of them are black and one (the first one) is white. Everyone of them behaves different and show themselves in different places. I‘ve met the third one in a dream. I told friends and since then the monsters got angry."
Anxietyhelp,fddjxj6,t3_ekreo8,1578315204.0,"I had a similar situation, or basically the same. I just ignored that person afterwards but I now know that that was stupid and probably hurt the other person. I now would try to make sure he knows that you really don’t want a relationship and that you maybe want some space for a week or so? 
I know I don’t know you or the other person but I hope I maybe helped :)
Have a nice day :)"

Anxietyhelp,fdbfnqg,t3_ekgl8e,1578256910.0,"My 'night anxiety' can be really bad. Especially when I am alone and near a window, I have this since I was young (it got worse the older I got)
I start to panic and cry and I cannot move.
When I realise an anxiety attack is coming, I try to call someone.
I did it the first time when I was young, I shouted for my dad (felt like I was shouting Years for him, but he came)
Nowadays I call a friend when I can.
But sometimes, I am just helpless...
I am going to a therapist very soon so I hope that’s gonna help :)"
