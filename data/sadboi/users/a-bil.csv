CPTSD,fqlbeti,t3_gjgqhk,1589452883.0,"I can totally relate to this, humans in general are attracted to people with shared past experiences. Unfortunately for us, it’s a traumatic past and therefore we associate ourselves unhealthily to people with similar trauma, and you shouldn’t feel bad at all for not wanting to form close relationships with people who are not as self-aware as you or working on their recovery. I‘m currently in the same exact situation, I feel guilty sometimes for distancing myself, but that’s just how we’re wired, to feel guilty about everything, and gaslight ourselves, and make ourselves the villains. But, the most important person is YOU and only YOU. That’s not selfish, it’s a step you have to do in a road full of recovery, it’s not selfish to want to better your own mental health, or to stop being triggered, or to not want to be overwhelmed by other people’s problems. I’m sure you’ll be ready to help and support, but the constant pressure of having to be ready to support 24/7 is just overwhelming and not sustainable, and that won’t help either of you. So don’t feel bad, hopefully during the recovery period and after recovery you’ll be able to form perfectly healthy close relationships with people and you’ll notice the drastic difference. :)"
