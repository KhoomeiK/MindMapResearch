relationships,fqzk7w4,t3_glpxw7,1589769141.0,"I've had this argument with atheist partners before as the religious (but not Muslim) person, and the question/scenario I tend to pose is this:

I have a religion. It is important to me. It gives me a lot of comfort and after attending services I feel better about the week ahead. Along with my religion comes a community. They're more open-minded, charitable, and kind than they are given credit for, despite a few weirdos. This is not to mention the fact that my faith brings extra meaning to what I do for a living. My moral compulsion to defend vulnerable people only gets me so far on a day-to-day, and the fact that my religious community not only supports me in my work, but sees what I do as important, fills my tank up while I undertake a difficult job.

You don't have a religion. You don't understand the things I described because you aren't part of it. You haven't identified what it is about my religion you find so upsetting that you wouldn't want your kids exposed to it beyond not wanting them to not have a say in how/if they worship.

In light of the foregoing, what's a compromise to you? Is there a conversation we can have with our kids when they're old enough to understand? Can we agree that religious beliefs will be up for discussion (but not nasty argument) in our family? If I can be comfortable with my kids choosing atheism, can you be comfortable with your kids choosing religion?

With some partners you can find a way to work through this, but with others you simply can't. The good news is, you have so much time to figure this out. You are so young and you seem to care for each other a great deal. Being young is great but it does tend to make you think in black and white, and I think you mind find some happiness in a gray area.

FWIW, my parents are both atheists, but I gravitated toward the religion my mom's siblings adhere to and here I am now. I considered myself an atheist or agnostic until I was a full-on adult and went on a little spiritual adventure on my own. So don't assume nothing can change.

I hope this is helpful in some way."

1. You are still vulnerable to deportation if you have a green card. If you run into any problems with the criminal justice system while you are an LPR, you might not be able to naturalize later, and might become removable.

2. If you have kids who are also LPRs who are under age 18, but they turn 18 while you are waiting to naturalize, they cannot derive citizenship from you anymore.

3. U.S. citizens can bring additional family members to the U.S. (ie. parents). Delays bringing parents mean an elderly parent could pass away while waiting for a visa. U.S. citizens trying to bring spouses and children can  bring them over faster also, so many people naturalize for this reason.

4. If you applied to become a citizen because you wanted the right to vote, this is probably going to make you miss the next election cycle.

They will probably want to see some documents that you just can't produce if you decide to apply for a passport, but if you actually did derive citizenship when a parent naturalized, you might get by with proof of your status at the time, their natz certificate, plus some other form of photo ID. The fee is pretty nominal. If all you have to lose is $145ish, and you actually are a citizen, then it might be worth it.

That said, if you have *any* doubts about your derived citizenship, I wouldn't do this. A false claim to citizenship, even if it's just a mistake, can land you in big trouble.

I've heard mixed things about whether it's okay to go hiking or do other activities outside. I've read that hiking is bad just like going anywhere else people might be is bad, but I've also read that it's fine to do it alone or with members of your own household. I've read you should wear a mask if you go, and I've read that it's not necessary.

I went to a certain huge state park recently to get outside while minimizing the chances of running into other people. This park is over an hour away, and I could have gone to one of the many popular trails or local parks near me, but because so much of this state park is just wilderness, you're highly unlikely to run into others. I saw maybe two other people out of their cars the entire day, and at no point did I have to get within six feet of anyone.

So just plan for it, you know? If you're walking a narrow little paved path in a residential area then yeah, it's going to be harder to distance yourself from strangers. But in an enormous forest where you're unlikely to see other people even during peak season when there isn't a pandemic going on, you can probably hike.

Figure out whether your dad derived or acquired citizenship first. The year your dad was born and the year you were born matter as the laws have changed numerous times.

Buffalo,fkdv1v2,t3_fhlgpf,1584096365.0,"I lived in a few apartments in Allentown/Elmwood and not one had a washer/dryer hookup. Some had laundry in the basement, but my first apartment in Allentown had me hoofing it to the laundromat.

Look at newer developments closer to downtown, I think you'll find what you're looking for there. Someone suggested Larkinville, and I would second that. Allentown is great when you're 22, but it gets old fast."
LawSchool,fjgjxwx,t1_fjgdpoa,1583328733.0,"I don't fully understand why you're being downvoted. I'm a (white) public interest lawyer and regrettably this is true. To be fair, my last gig was in a particularly dysfunctional office.. 

It isn't just micro either, it's macro. I don't see very many people of color (especially women) in executive positions in public interest organizations, or on the board."

bipolar,fa5o4uc,t3_e2v1qd,1575816920.0,"I am going through this re-diagnosis process as we speak. I wrote out a long post but it got out of control.

Long story short, I suspect I have been misdiagnosed for a long time because my family (despite being simultaneously emotionally distant and demanding of my time) are supportive, and because I am a high-achieving professional who outwardly appears to ""have it together.""

Right now my diagnosis is up in the air. I may have some combination of bipolar, BPD, ADHD, and PTSD. Could be one of these, two, three, or all. But as I read more about BPD - especially when I read about examples of behaviors that come along with it - I feel like I'm reading a story about myself.

If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer."

If she needs to study in a very specific way to succeed that's on her. If you don't benefit from traditionally accepted study habits, trust yourself and rely on your own habits.

BPD,f9ioigj,t3_e51uiz,1575342159.0,My FP gives me the silent treatment when I do something that mildly irritates him. So now I'm giving him the silent treatment too. It's very empowering. I assume that's why he does it.
