Always leave their island through the airport. Even if it takes for-flipping-ever. I actually only get 1 pocketful every week, but if you sell around 550 that's about 2 mil, which is more than I need anyway.

It usually goes, the higher the price, the longer the wait.

The hosts here are amazing. If you plan to tip and have a pocket space left, put the tip bag in your inventory before hand to cut down on open windows while you're at their island. :)"
