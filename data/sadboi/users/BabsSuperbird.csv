mentalhealth,fq5k993,t3_ggs39f,1589108599.0,"Hi OP, you are a brave and beautiful soul for speaking up for yourself and for sharing. Your story stopped me in my tracks. There is this odd thing in the universe how your friend showed up that night, and it saved you. When my daughter was 14, she was going through a rough patch. I was keeping a fairly close eye on her, but I had a weekly aerobics class after work. One evening, after I parked my car at the recreation center, something told me to go home immediately. Do not go to aerobics class, something’s wrong. Get home now. I’ve learned to trust my inner voice, so I drove home quickly, I checked on my daughter, and I didn’t sleep all night. I kept watch over her. Next day, I still had that feeling so I called a psych doc friend of mine, and brought my daughter in for a consultation. Oh at the time my daughter was sure she hated me because the doc put her in the hospital. Turns out my daughter told me later on when she stopped hating me, that night she had made a noose and planned to hang herself in the tree. I cannot fathom what would have happened had I not listened to my inner voice. It’s been over 10 years now. Daughter is better. There had been an online predator messing with her mind back then, and she had spun into a deep depression. We reported everything we could but I think he got away with it."
creepyencounters,fpte1lt,t3_g3f435,1588889543.0,"Thanks for sharing u/TheZombieMedic. I cannot imagine the horror of what you saw. My daughter who is 25 now, said at the age of 9, “Momma, Suicide is like a misery bomb. It explodes pain on everybody else.”
Now how would a 9-year old know that? Her uncle, my brother, killed himself that day. Sadly, my other brother did the same a year later. It’s not something you get over. But I learned how to live in the present, enjoy what I have, and never let that happen to me."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fpje8lm,t3_gdkelj,1588665302.0,"I respectfully wish to share the response from a person I know who has been homeless. Response from ANONYMOUS as follows: ""All right.  Well yes, a lot of homeless have underlying problems that assisted in their downfall. I have been homeless.  I have slept under the bridges, in bathrooms and portable bathrooms.  I even got myself arrested so I wouldn't die one night in BIG CITY when the temperatures were dropping into the upper teens; several people I know passed away that night. Some kind-hearted building owners talked to us and explained that they'll leave an abandoned parking garage open, and on our end we are not to leave a mess or tear things up and must up clean up after ourselves.  This is what most of us do that are homeless, but there is ignorance in this regard.  What we saw as little rich kids that would torment us: you have heard the stories of a homeless person being doused with gasoline and lit on fire; this doesn't happen often but yes it does happen.  But, not many people hear of the homeless that are asleep and somebody comes in with a hammer and caves in their head.  This happens more than anybody would like to admit.  

Now then, on the issue of camps: a lot of camps have rules.  Most of the camps that are successful - I say successful as ""please know about us"": surrounding businesses Know About Us and there's no static, one of the most prevailing rules that I have experienced in camps that succeed is ""no drugs"".  Yes, drinking, but no crack, no weed, no meth, because we know that will just open the door for problems within the camp itself and also from the outside community.  Nobody wants needles and crack pipes, baggies, etc. left lying around on the ground and some doped up idiot chasing the high and trying to rob somebody.  None of us wants that.  A lot of the homeless that I have run across through the years, oh really all of us that have been homeless, have a sad story.  My personal one is my infant son died and I ran from the pain.  I couldn't cope with what was happening;  my heart was ripped out.  A lot of others are veterans, honorably discharged but because of what they sacrificed for our country, our country then turns their back on them.  They have PTSD, physical injuries but then there are others.  I had a friend JANE DOE, everybody called her ""Doe"".  She was born with Spina Bifida and is - well, was - legally paralyzed from the waist down.  She could kind of crawl but couldn't really work and with complications with the Spina Bifida when she got pregnant she lost her kid from stillbirth.  Well, she was trying, and the sad thing is she finally did get a motorized wheelchair to help her get around and one day she was hit by a drunk driver (a hit and run); it took her four days to die but even though she was homeless she tried to help others being homeless.  I really learned and appreciated what little I did have, and a large majority like I said have been cracked on by life but still call their way on trying just to live.  But if given a chance, a lot of the homeless make something of themselves and would be somebody that you would like living next to your grandmother.  

Ignorance brings suffering, anger breeds more anger, violence more violence, and on the same hand compassion breeds greater compassion.  

If you don't like homeless camps, help do something about it.  Help someone up from that pit.  Help get somebody to work for the first day, even though at the end of that day they have nowhere to go but maybe a gas station bathroom, a clearing in the woods, a dry area under a bridge, and get ready for the next day.  Please think of your fellow man and remember ignorance breeds fear, suffering and heartlessness.  This act when they want to get rid of a ""problem"" they are increasing the problem."""
mentalhealth,fpiql7f,t3_gdn2u3,1588646520.0,"u/MollieMillions, First, I’m sorry to hear the sorrow for your family. But what happened to them does not mean your destiny is written. You can be the exception, and make positive choices for good mental health. I recall having this very discussion with my therapist. Both of my two older brothers killed themselves: one at age 43, and the other a year later at 38. My half-brother has mental illness and was incarcerated 16 years. Well, I’m still alive and I helped my half-brother get paroled. We stay close, and though we both struggle sometimes, we seek every type of help available to us. I hope you can do the same - find peace and happiness. Because you deserve it."

I encourage you to seek counseling; it can be hard to find but even small rural communities I’ve heard of have missions or community mental health care. Even so, it can take a few tries to find the best “match” with the right therapist. If one doesn’t click with you or makes you worse, you don’t have to stick with them! Tbh I learned a lot from self help books once I started empowering myself to take control and figure out why people close to me were abusing me. I was hospitalized a few times. In some cases it was forced upon me; that was hard. I wish you the best,OP"
AmItheAsshole,fo5u3iz,t1_fo35ygp,1587535730.0,"Sounds lovely, but that’s one reason I prefer not to eat anything I didn’t prepare. I have a severe tree nut allergy. On my Dad’s side of the family, nearly everyone is vegetarian and their friends are in the same church denomination that is nearly all vegan. So we go to the friend’s house and oh, my! What a lovely vegan supper! Out comes the pie, the crust proudly made with cashew nut flour. I never would have known until I started going into anaphylaxis, except that I do know to ask. Darn. I really used to love the vegetarian potlucks after church. But with all my allergies, I just can’t. Now on the other hand, my Dad has lived either with me or near me for 22 years. It’s easy enough to prepare foods he likes and keep stuff out that he can’t eat."
