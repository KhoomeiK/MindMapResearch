That's Biden's idea of a compromise between progressive Obama and conservative McConnell, what do you think the compromise between conservative Biden and even more conservative McConnell would look like?

Just look at a Trump vs Biden matchup - Biden has fucked over way, way, way more people in his fifty years than Trump could hope to with the remaining eight months of his term. Biden is responsible for millions of deportations of latinos and tens of millions of drug arrests of people of colour as a major architect in the war on drugs, not to mention all of the arab folks he got killed in the other war he helped create - Iraq. He's done way more damage to latino, black, and arabic folks than Trump has.

Okay, I'm white so let's pretend that I'm just gonna ignore all of that. I'm transgender though and next year there's gonna be a big supreme court ruling that will effectively decide whether discrimination against transgender people in all its forms is legal or not. It's expected to come down 5-4 in favour of discrimination. Would've been great for me if Hillary won or if Obama got Merrick Garland through, right? Would've turned that 5-4 into a 4-5, right? Wrong. In less than a year most democratic voters and supporters forgot that Garland was the compromise pick, a compromise between Obama and Mitch McConnell. In fact Biden was one of the key figures who pushed Garland onto Obama. Garland has a record of favouring corporations over LGBT rights and expression, not to mention some comments along those lines, including some extremely worrying ones about Lawrence v. Texas. So if Garland got through in 2016 or if Hillary won and appointed Garland because democrat faithfuls have goldfish memories I would be just as screwed. And I'm supposed to go out and vote for a guy who was ""Obama's conservative side"" when just as VP he pushed for a judge that would've made it legal for me to be fired or evicted for existing? I'm supposed to go with the guy who is way to the right of Obama who still wants to compromise with McConnell on SCOTUS appointments? I would gain nothing from voting for him.

Vulnerable minorities have a lot to lose in an election but sometimes we're just completely fucked regardless and that's one of the reasons why minorities often don't come out in large numbers. It's literally a waste of our time if we're just as screwed regardless of who we vote for so we're better off not spending the time and money on transportation and work a shift or stay home and watch a new movie.

Metroid,fleuwpp,t1_flbx2ww,1585092021.0,"Well the ejection sequence might be unknown to the X. After all, the X didn't attempt to set the self-destruct sequence built into the station, it attempted to overheat the boilers. Or rather, a scientist host attempted to overheat the boiler. If they knew that there was a manual self-destruct sequence it might've gone for that instead. If that scientist host might have not known about the self-destruct I think it's reasonable to say that it might not know about the ejection failsafe.

This reasoning brings up the question of why didn't the SA-X try to use the manual self-destruct. I could speculate on that. For starters, maybe Samus didn't actually know for a fact that there was a self-destruct sequence and that maybe she was guessing. Maybe Samus only learned of it after she was assigned to investigate the station and that the X that infested her from earlier wouldn't have had that knowledge. Or maybe they did know that and that's what the SA-X was heading to do when you fight it at the end of the game.

Also in regards to the locks, I think it's heavily implied that the higher level security locks are in fact more resilient.

DataHoarder,fk7dbyo,t1_fk734d2,1583933993.0,Yeah they'll probably copy the Nintendo formula for this year and then try the same thing next year. Then they'll realize that they spent a whole bunch of money for a hype show that you actually have less control over and eventually garners you more criticism and negative publicity.
BreadTube,fk6d9zj,t1_fk5y0dt,1583899106.0,"I was thinking possibly opposite reason why she waited for Warren to drop out - because she preferres Warren to Sanders. Contra has certainly shown that she's gullible in the past, not really one to take to heart the phrase ""when people show you who they are, believe it the first time"", and she's certainly no stranger to, err, I'll call them *lapses of judgement.*"
BreadTube,fk596ar,t1_fk52kau,1583875904.0,"My guess? 

She was either waiting for Warren to drop out *or* she figured that her position would be obvious but figured it might be needed since it's close between Bernie and Biden."

antifastonetoss,fjs19fy,t1_fjot6lu,1583592697.0,I unsubbed from there last month after realizing that I've only seen like one post from there on my dash in the previous month that was actually a joke at the expense of arseholes instead of at minorities.

LeopardsAteMyFace,fjs0xf8,t1_fjrkgrx,1583592496.0,"Same thing with /r/RightWingLGBT. That place was pretty much always exclusively a place to hate trans people, muslims, and arabs and they pretend they're all queer by liking the ""good ones"" like anti-semite Milo Yiannopolus. When the trans military ban went into effect the sub went mask off and half the posters went on about how the LGB were next. It ended up becoming the most upvoted thread in the sub's history but they locked it and later deleted it because they realized it could make the case for getting admins to quarantine or even ban the subreddit."
