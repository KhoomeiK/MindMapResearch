MovieSuggestions,fmv5f7w,t3_fwbqi2,1586406558.0,"NICK OF TIME!!! It's such an underrated movie, and I think gave me a literal panic attack, but I couldn't stop smiling, it was so ingenious. Plus, it has Johnny Depp. ðŸ˜° And he's sooo cute in it. 100/10 recommend. It's actually insanely good. It needs more attention than it has."
mentalillness,fb1akmj,t3_eazyei,1576434136.0,Hell yeah!
mentalillness,f74ja0i,t3_dub5t9,1573403314.0,"Even though you may be concerned, you are in an abusive relationship. That is not something that's even remotely ok. You need to get out of there, get him help without putting anything on yourself, or report him. He is mentally abusing you, and expecting you to submit to him. Please, for your own well being, and to teach him, cut ties with him, report him, or something. Don't just stay in that situation and suffer. Do what's right for you."
mentalillness,f1g9s1q,t1_f1g8klv,1569462860.0,"Omg. That's so sweet. I'm...surviving. The supposed bipolar part really isn't that much of a problem, it's just a modification of what's already happening, so it's really not that big a deal. However, the depression part has gotten REAL bad lately. But, you know...surviving. ðŸ˜‘"
mentalillness,f1g9h6g,t1_f1df1gm,1569462681.0,I feel you.
mentalillness,f1g9f3a,t1_f1d0euy,1569462645.0,"Wow. You go girl! I've looked up bipolar disorder and bp depression, but I suck at even the simplest of research, so I was a little confused on it. I was just trying to get opinions from others. You're saying possibly, so I'll just keep that in mind. Thanks!"
mentalillness,f1g91ad,t1_f1c4jf0,1569462428.0,"Honestly, like I said it's about balanced, so if it's one day of up, it's about one day of down to match. I mean, of course my life is constant down, but that aside."
mentalillness,f1g8vcz,t1_f1c4lmu,1569462337.0,"I can't do therapy, but I do have a psychiatrist for medication and stuff. The depression meds are probably fine. I was just wondering."

BeardedDragons,es1oeih,t3_c5gfsb,1561501648.0,"It's just my mom is making me feel worse about the whole thing. She's like ""that's not fair, that's not right, you don't love her"". I've asked her to ignore it, but she just gives me a look like she won't.ðŸ˜©"
