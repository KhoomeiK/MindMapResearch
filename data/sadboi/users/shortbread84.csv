ElementaryTeachers,fkg1dez,t3_fi198e,1584147543.0,"First I would decide where you would like to go. Google teacher preparation programs near me. See where that gets you. You can also call these colleges and speak with a guidance counselor or career advisor. They would be able to point you in the right direction. My best piece of advice though, should you choose to do this, is to make sure you have a specialized degree. Reading speciaIist, speech, math coach... I am a classroom teacher in the states and I am looking for a way out. Teaching has gotten to be extremely difficult so i would caution you to consider this carefully. Not trying to discourage you, but i can guarantee that what you think teaching is and what it actually is are very different. Good luck."
AnalFissures,fip236i,t3_f90w80,1582596303.0,"First things first, get an actual diagnosis. If it is a fissure, your doctor will recommend a high fiber diet with tons of water. They will probably also recommend being on stool softeners and miralax for awhile to let things heal. Also, taking sitz baths after bms and whenever you can is good too. Most likely this will heal within six weeks. Good luck."
AnalFissures,fi5s69o,t3_f6k6le,1582169503.0,"Since December, wow. Well it really depends on how big and serious the fissure is. She needs to go have it looked at and take it from there. I'm thinking her pain is probably going to outweigh her embarrassment. Her fissure is definitely chronic at this point. She can try the ointment, but at this point it's probably surgical."

AnalFissures,fh9tijl,t3_f21ojq,1581389251.0,"High fiber tons of water. I eat a lot of chia seeds, sweet potatoes, oatmeal, beans, lentils and very little cheese or bread. I also found a high fiber almond milk yogurt at the grocery store that I always have on hand to fill in any fiber gaps. I eat pumpkin seeds (well chewed!) and raisins for snack. I also like Barbaras puffins cereal to munch on. Breakfast is usually oatmeal with fruit or eggs with black beans and salsa and avacado. Lunch is usually leftovers. I try to make a big pot of soup to eat all week. That makes life a bit easier. This week I made a three bean soup. Dinner is a bit more tricky because I'm feeding myself and my kids. If I have tomato sauce I put my fiber powder right in it. You don't taste it at all. I don't eat very much red meat at all because that will back you up like nobodies business. I try to throw in veggies like broccoli or peas. I also always have pears on hand. I know that's a huge confusing mess I've just told you but I hope it helps!"
AnalFissures,fh9ogf7,t3_f1uv05,1581385983.0,"I have the same concern about my body becoming dependent on miralax or colace. I have since switched to a type of magnesium called magnesium L-theorate. I take two with my dinner and make sure I drink a ton of water before bed. The next day I get up and the beginning of the poo is a little more formed but the rest is nice and soft. This type of magnesium is also good for cognitive function and memory, which is a bonus for me personally. Good luck!"

AnalFissures,ffirlm2,t3_ett2qf,1579980961.0,"Don't forget to take sitz baths a few times a day if you can manage it. That will bring blood to the area and speed up healing. The water and fiber are great, just don't go too crazy with the fiber or you might get the opposite affect you were hoping for. In the past I have taken magnesium to keep things soft. It does heal, it just takes a really long time. Even after you think it's all set, it's best to pretend it isn't for a month or two. All the best to you. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

Less constipation and the minor leakage i had from surgery stopped. I found that using chia seeds in my cereal was a great way to get a good fiber boost in the morning. I take a fiber supplement. Drink between 50-75 ml of water a day. I avoid eating a lot of meat, rice, or anything else constipating. Good luck!"
ElementaryTeachers,fdssidb,t3_emseey,1578707374.0,"If I were you I would go the nursing route. Education is getting more and more challenging. We are being asked to compete with more and more but we are not given the resources or time. We are told what to teach, when, how, with what... There's very little autonomy. It's also become very customer service like. Pleasing parents is key and parents often don't want to hear about how their child did something wrong. The pay is awful most places. Become a nurse and then be a school nurse? As a nurse you'll always have a job."

AnalFissures,fdkmmp5,t3_elmh18,1578506711.0,"As people here are telling you, it varies from person to person. The best thing you can do is drink a ton of water, increase the fiber in your diet and take miralax to keep things soft. You can also use magnesium glycinate to keep things soft and regular. Sitting in a sitz bath a few times a day for ten to fifteen minutes each will help keep it clean and relax the muscles which will increase healing. It's also be careful of doing any strenuous lifting or exercise. Good luck!"
Anxiety,fdiswrr,t3_elm008,1578450315.0,"I take something called mirtazapine. It's not usually prescribed for anxiety, but zoloft gave me hives. My one piece of advice is to AVOID Paxil. I had to come off my Paxil before getting pregnant and it was the worst most scary thing. I felt like I was going to jump out of my skin for about two weeks. As far as Xanax goes, i was under the impression that this was more something used to treat panic attacks, not for long term use but I could be wrong. Find a good psychiatrist and see what your options are. Good luck. You're doing the right thing and you're going to feel better soon!"

It's been hard to keep it all together, and I'm at home with the baby and toddler, not working. My best advice to you is to figure out what your medicaton helps with most. Is it organization? Managing your emotions? Focus? Then try to create a plan from there. Utilize apps, lists and even therapy if you have to. I did therapy during both pregnancies and it was very helpful.

If you're able, have him start seeing a therapist. He also sounds like he could use a hobby or an outlet of some kind. Something that he is really good at that he can feel good about.

It's basically a bunch of teachers who sit around a table and give suggestions to help. You must then implement those suggestions and track data for six weeks and report back. You have to do this for three cycles, 18 weeks. You have to do this, even when you know nothing suggested is going to work. It's basically a way for schools to slow down the special Ed referral process. This process does work for some kids with minor issues, but for the big issues, you really need to pass go, collect 200 and get down to business. I would never dream of telling a parent they need to have their kid evaluated. I'm more sensitive to this, since I have the same issue, so I try to be very objective with what I tell parents.
