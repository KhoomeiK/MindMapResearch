Anxiety,ergghri,t1_erg6iiw,1560838337.0,"Yeah, it sometimes sucks thinking about how it'll get better because all I can ever think about is ""why not now?""

I feel like that a lot but I have to remind myself that these are people who care about me and want the best for me."
Anxiety,erg5icx,t3_c1wblv,1560827036.0,"Hi, I'm not very good in these kinds of situations but please be hopeful.

I send so much love and support your way and know you have people to talk to if you ever need to talk :)"
