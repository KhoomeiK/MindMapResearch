Sprint,fpv8lri,t1_fpv7rc4,1588938482.0,"The paper says that for a new device with a new number and SIM it's not necessary. It automatically does it upon the starting setup.

Sprint,fpv7o7z,t1_fpv5zau,1588937656.0,I hadn't tried that. I finally got customer service a few minutes ago and they fixed it for me. Some automatic restriction was put on for some reason.
Sprint,fpv5912,t3_gfoaeo,1588935348.0,"Adding: I finally did get into the My Sprint account, but it seems that somehow my new account number untethered itself from it, and it only shows an old paid off debt, but no payment from starting the new plan or bill for this month. When trying to register on Sprint's site it says I can use this phone number or the new account number that came with it."
Sprint,fpv4z0c,t1_fpv4ssh,1588935069.0,No service at all. It's a Galaxy S10+

Sprint,fpuv2b8,t1_fpuusf8,1588924706.0,I hope that's not the case. I doubt there's a store in Japan. It would also be weird in my opinion for my first bill payment amount (right around $100) to set off some limit

Guy forced me off 3 times in one race every time I was in front of him on race C today, and I was penalized for it. Just on how the person is as a racer.  The game isn't punishing the obviously intentional harshly enough"
granturismo,foyesgz,t1_foyb1hn,1588171214.0,"Gotcha. 6AM here, should work. I've given em a read and sounds good. Looking forward to it"
granturismo,foxlopo,t3_g9wlsn,1588147967.0,The game takes your best result if I'm not mistaken
granturismo,foxllp2,t1_fowqco4,1588147887.0,It seems like they treat every punt as a brake check. It needs a serious rework.
granturismo,foxjpfw,t3_g9yfpy,1588146135.0,"I've been running mediums for first 3, finish the rest on hards. Hasn't given me any issues so far and got a win by about 2s starting in 3rd place with that. I'd say start on hards if you're starting anywhere outside the top 4 of 5 because you will kill your tires in the middle of the pack until it thins out some. Learned that the hard way my first attempt.

Edited to add: my strategy for the NSX. Results may vary on other vehicles though"
granturismo,foxi0qb,t3_ga0t1r,1588144612.0,"I'd be up for it. Trying to figure out what that translates to in Japanese time, but I should be able to make it.

granturismo,fotz69p,t1_fosm8bb,1588071302.0,Lol tense is putting it lightly when the pressure's really on you from 2nd place
granturismo,fosi80s,t1_foscwel,1588031212.0,"Most of my races this week have been pretty good. Managed a win last night, though I did have a guy in an earlier race ram me 3 or 4 times going into a braking zone around the first tight right-hander and cause me to get a 4s penalty after I fell back to 10th from a spin. Hopefully it wont be too much hell for ya."
granturismo,fosbx01,t1_forhyzd,1588027709.0,"Also very true. Had it happen a few times over the past few weeks where one guy swore I intentionally punted him regardless, and a bunch of idiots don't know how not to use you as brakes (especially on those hairpins at Fuji üòë). I just deal the best I can at that point"
granturismo,foqowlf,t1_fopb3re,1587998103.0,"I normally flash high beams as soon as they're righted back in front of me. I'll kill my DR a little to give him his spot in front of me back. If I have to fight from the back again, so be it. That's the fun stuff anyway"
granturismo,fnqrdfm,t1_fnql8ss,1587170552.0,"Lol congrats! Fancy seeing you here, bud. Hoping I run into ya again for some good battles"
granturismo,fnqqxsq,t1_fnpmtiq,1587170282.0,"The race honestly isn't bad. This is one of about 3 in the past 48 hours of me really grinding for DR. Still positive,  and my first daily win under my belt  in months."
granturismo,fnqqjoy,t1_fnq11yu,1587170039.0,Will be looking into that guide sometime today as well. Was getting late over on my side so kinda got lazy on searching it up
granturismo,fnpha4f,t1_fnpgwb6,1587145485.0,Somehow avoided the second 5. That sounds absolutely horrid though. It was enough of a pain trying to make a comeback with just the 5s
granturismo,fnny0j5,t1_fnkx7kc,1587105308.0,You got a kart? I just got a 1966 Honda S800 üòÇ I think my worst draw so far. Will have to confirm later

granturismo,fl38poc,t3_flvd5n,1584772972.0,"I feel you, brotha. Just got a 3 second yellow flag penalty for passing the vehicle that caused the flag as it got reset onto the track. I feel so loved by PD right now üòë"
granturismo,fjkal2b,t1_fjk7d7z,1583423526.0,I had the same when I tried Monza earlier. Didn't go back to it after that race. Brands had been relatively clean most of the day for me though

trucksim,fj2p8qb,t1_fj23vt4,1582949751.0,No. All progress so far should stay the same. The bigger issue is making sure you don't have any that conflict and setting them up in the right order on the game.
