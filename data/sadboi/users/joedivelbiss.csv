Divorce_Men,ewli2jc,t1_ewko8z5,1565525161.0,"Pain is a very powerful motivator. The past is the past, focus on the present by getting yourself to your very best. And perhaps at your very best, you will reunite with the love of your life or find someone new, or be ok with being alone for now. Do not let fear in to your life.

Eat healthy, excercise daily, get plenty of sunshine, abstain from alcohol and drugs, take your meds if you take meds and get sound sleep. Get outside and hang out in nature.

Enjoy this time with yourself and pursue interests and activities that are positive, healthy and fulfilling. Let go of regret, get focussed and excercise self-control and unwavering discipline. It's Time to Move On.

A romantic relationship with an old girlfriend from 20+ years ago lasted a week (7 days). Fortunately, I learned a lot from her through trial and error and we had a few good laughs. However, it didn't work out and I think I am better off alone. Time to Move On, again.

Nothing ventured, nothing gained. (Proverb:
you can't expect to achieve anything if you never take any risks and open yourself up to new experiences.)

Time to Move On, Wildflowers by Tom Petty

It's time to move on, time to get going
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
It's time to move on, it's time to get going

Broken skyline, movin' through the airport
She's an honest defector
Conscientious objector
Now her own protector

Broken skyline, which way to love land
Which way to something better
Which way to forgiveness
Which way do I go

(Chorus)

Sometime later, getting the words wrong
Wasting the meaning and losing the rhyme
Nauseous adrenaline
Like breakin' up a dogfight
Like a deer in the headlights
Frozen in real time
I'm losing my mind

(Chorus)"

camping,esymkry,t3_c9b09v,1562345683.0,"I lost the love of my life to divorce. Not my wife, my Viking pop up camper. :)

That thing was supremely better than the numerous tents that I've set up for me and my four kids.  Routinely, I'd pull it out of the garage and set it up on the drive way on weekends so the kids could play in it. I  elwould gaze at it with pride from the livingroom. Damned.

Ironically, I bought this camper for the purpose of getting my ex-wife out with us on trips and into the outdoors.  She only  went once but she seemed to like it very much. One time I even dragged it down to Naperville, IL for a college reunion BBQ. Like Uncle Eddy, I pulled up to the curb and set it up in the driveway. The kids went absolutely wild.

Now I'm back on the ground in a tent at it's fine by me. But man, that camper was so sweet!"

bipolar,esut04o,t1_esunykd,1562288570.0,"Well primarily it stimulates the creative juices when combining pictures and written words. 

It's playfull and as it turns out not only do I have a lot to say but I think I am pretty good at expressing myself, commanding the written word and taking interesting pictures. 

It makes me feel in control of my moods as well because I am able to observe my thoughts as they pass without attaching a feeling. I am not my thoughts. Like meditating. 

Also, there are no penalties for jumping around and making constant revisions and edits; it is an excercise of continuous improvement and alterations.  I'm the boss. ;)

And it keeps my mind focused with creative, positive and productive thoughts. I realize from reading my journal entries that my mind is on hyper drive most of the time and extremely noisy. Not a bad thing when you are intensely trying to capture your thoughts, observations and feelings. I am suprised at how confidently aware I am of what I am writing about most of the time. 

I guess I am stimulating my brain with positive experiences and rewards vs. being consumed with negative thoughts of self-loathing and self-hatred."
