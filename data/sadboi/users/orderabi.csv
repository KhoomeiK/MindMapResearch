This whole Ottoman elite was using a different language than poor common people is so based, and portrays an image that Ottomans had to talk simple to embrace the whole public like Ataturk did. But in reality, you can expect a Sultan to speak the common language when your people are Turks, Bulgarians, Greeks, Africans, Arabs, Russians and more. Which common language? I see that many Kemalists adresss Ottoman times as if it was a Turkish Nation that populated by mostly Turks and criticize accordingly. 

Ottoman Sultans were speaking a Turkish that also their people could understand, otherwise history would tell us funny stories of Sultan or Peasant not understanding each other or whatever but there are many archives about Ottoman Sultans blend in bazaars and talk to people unanimously. 

Even todays Turkish is so different from one region to another, Istanbul Turkish is considered elite within Anatolia and you would not understand many Turks as well.

Armenians call the same version ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù, just saying. And I am pretty sure 1.5 - 3 millions of lives lost or destroyed is relatively much higher than some thousands young dudes Ottoman took for their armies. 

This whole ‚Äúliberation‚Äù was just for the sake of nationalism and religious, Ottomans were nor heavily Islamic, nor Turkic. It was a form of Roman Empire with Islamic touch. The Greek rebellion was not for liberation even, just for a better life. 

Today, I firmly believe, what we have done with our region is beyond disaster. I am not trying to say Ottomans had to continue, but within Ottomans, we carved out religious, ethnic racist small countries who are useless. Only Turkey is having a decent army, and rest are either sitting on other‚Äôs ideologies, other‚Äôs cultural influences and so on. 

United Balkan-Asia countries, from Bulgaria to Greece, Istanbul to Kirkuk, with tourism, natural resources, and human potential, would thrive today.

First of all, your tweet suggests as if Balkans were so rich and Ottomans took over this richness, used it for Muslim Turks or whatsoever. 

Europe was never prospering until Industrial age, and their wealth, even today, is due to their colonial past that they fulfilled their treasury with African, American, Indian, Arabic gold and resources. Do you want to check how long Spain and Portugal lived off their economy thanks to this gold par example. You‚Äôre talking, as if Ottomans did not touch you, you would be Germany tier countries or another America. 

I invite you to check how many princes in Balkans were living off with Ottoman debt money or aid in terms of protection? When Ottomans took over, it was already a failing region with zero infrastructure. 

I am not saying Ottomans made you rich, or you should be thankful, I am a respectful person for your patriotism, but Balkans bitching about Ottoman is one of the least fun topics for me. Are you speaking Turkish? Are you Muslim? Are you using Turkish alphabet, do you have paintings of Ottoman colonial ships ripping off your gold? Do you have stories that you were chained and forced to work for cotton, or sex slaves as a whole population? You only have this young kids going to die, which is only reflecting one side of the coin, how many people of your race were vezirs, grand vezirs? Ottoman high rank officials, including soldiers to politicians were all from Balkan states, they lived in wealth and pleasure in Istanbul for centuries to come, they became the elite, and lived off with status quo wealth with Ottoman Turkish vilager taxes. Let‚Äôs talk about that then? 

But no need, just look back at Africa, or Belarus, or Syria, or Morocco, Libya, see the effects of true colonialism. Then look at your sovereign state. And please check also how you diminished your wealth in Balkan Wars. You would be so okay to form crusades and kill Muslims, those youngs would be named martyrs. But when they fought and martyred under Ottofucks, you make tantrums. 

It‚Äôs all gone, stop the corruption, start production and your countries will be already dominating. (Same for Turkey)

‚ÄúThis time they came to stay. In 1371 the outcome of the Battle on the Maritsa secured their hold. After this date they unfolded an impressive building activity. Within half a century the Ottomans developed their own style of architecture. By the end of their rule over the Balkans, in 1912, their total architectural output reached around 20.000 buildings: mosques, schools, baths, caravanserais, kitchens for the poor, castles, dervish convents, mighty bridges and monumental mausolea for the great military or spiritual leaders.‚Äù

If you prefer to stick some servers where you enjoyed and if you can keep enjoying the game without using your logic that much, I think you will have fun as well.

I am playing Squad from time to time since the release. If we wholeheartedly try to drop our personal love for Project Reality type of games and take Squad as a stand alone product, this game sucks. 

They are constantly adding new stuff without actually finishing the game. The first years were cringe if you had AMD rigs, we tried to forget that, but come on, after all these years there are still same problems and solution is yet to come.

1-) Every map looks hell different from one another. It feels like in some maps you‚Äôre playing Squad beta test, and in some maps you feel the graphics. Some maps are so bright, some has shit color pattern, there is nothing we can call ‚Äúcomposition‚Äù in this game. Big minus.
2-) The game is not noob friendly, noob friendly servers are just tolerating you being noob, that‚Äôs it. Nobody will play that bullshit tutorial. 
3-) Public servers are just full of with memesters. Roleplaying Delta Force memes, people trying to land 2 helicopter onto each other, people that never talk, people who never care the gameplay even if you kick them from your Squad, they open their own and walk around etc.
4-) There is no progression, no levels, no profile, no ranks, no commends, after a while you don‚Äôt know why you play this game. Squad moments? They are not that special. 
5) There is no system to make people play the game the way it should be played. Do you know how many times we and my 2 friends stood without squads as our team mates locked their Squads since they are either BTR, Logi, Heli squad and if the rest of the squads are dickheads who don‚Äôt even speak since they are on discord, you‚Äôre fucked.

ClashRoyale,fnxtwie,t1_fnxqnu7,1587346244.0,"If a card is broken, it‚Äôs broken in level 9 and level 13, over leveling just makes it obvious. Of course some trash cards may have a chance to get better results because ladder people don‚Äôt usually play meta decks or play good. But if a card becomes the top selected card within the scope of 14 days and sits at 51% wr it tells you something. You don‚Äôt have to ignore what‚Äôs obvious and what for tournaments to get an idea but use your eyes, brain and make a decision. Yes, in ladder people stay afk, play under leveled cards and have different king tower levels but FOR EXAMPLE what they have done with WITCH was so obvious that you could even tell by playing ladder. 

And you should be one digit IQ if you‚Äôre really thinking CR will never care ladder, their main source of player base and be very stable with their tweaks. How many cards were buffed and nerfed and how many chest sales you remember aims a cash grab from that card? 

Mini pekka is broken, I don‚Äôt give a fuck about tournament players. Maybe you don‚Äôt like broken word but there is not even a close card that cheap kills tanks so fast, move that fast, and at the same time be versatile, win condition etc. What‚Äôs the point of using prince when you have minipekka for example? Charging gives you nothing as of today when we have many cards to disable that. Tanks killers should all be buffed or re arranged. Mini pekka 5 elixir is okay solution, less movement speed is okay, less hp is okay. 4 elixir, come on. Goblin giant is 6 elixir and serves no purpose, mega knight does not damage air units upon landing, giant is extreme slow, we have shit tanks but amazing tank killers. 

Admit it, it‚Äôs lazy design. I want mini golems and mini balloon also. Imagine how stupid it would be."
ClashRoyale,fnxpy12,t1_fnxg703,1587343865.0,"Are you guys thinking if a card is broken it can somehow stay un noticed in ladder or vice versa. I feel like I am talking to kids to be honest. You‚Äôre literally saying if tourney standards wont pick X card for some meta reasons but this card would be so broken and everybody will abuse it in ladder, CR will turn a blind eye because its not balanced by ladder. Hear how stupid it sounds."
europe,fnwkw53,t1_fnwh335,1587320337.0,"I also agree Turkey should not be in EU, when you talk about this, modern turkish people think either you are bashing Turks in general or you‚Äôre anti European with conservative tendencies. Even though average Turkish citizen from Istanbul may look like European and relatively more civil than any ME citizen, Turkey is not only Istanbul, southern part of the country where our lovely Kurdish tribes live is still tribalistic, honor killings, animal rape, mafia etc... Probably they would be the ones who would rush to Europe once they get free visa. Maaayybeee maybeee in a better future only some cities in Turkey can have free visa with autonomous city rule type of thing that modern Turks can come and go, but then people would argue its against equality and Turkey is nation state... 

But for Nato, I disagree. Again, some people in West think Nato is a gift to Turkey, and somehow, Nato is a democratic European pact, Portugal was a dictatorship when it got into, it‚Äôs just a military pact. If you kick out a nation from that just because a temporal government, you‚Äôre totally going against the core purpose of the alliance. Imagine Erdogan is gone, fastforward 50 years, Turkey is not a Nato, but a relatively more liberal government is ruling thanks to young people being more liberal as years go by, but they sit in an alliance with China and Russia, it‚Äôs not only danger to whole Europe to create another Russia on EU borders, but also a loss of military market. 

Turkey is not Nato member for Europeans, it‚Äôs a Nato member American/German weapon deals and their future war against Russia. 

That being said, there are many countries within Nato who buys Russian stuff. The whole tantrums around s400 was exposed when Russians faked a phone call with Lindsey Graham if you want to check, he clearly says to pranksters that Turkey is being bashed for that solely because it can encourage other countries to buy from Russians. Americans don‚Äôt love free market competition that much.

Edit: I don‚Äôt think Turkey is hostile to Europe, people love Brits, Balkans, Spanish, Nordic people but I can‚Äôt say the same thing for German zone, Dutch, Aussies, Greeks. 

Also, Turkey is not obliged to hold refugees but Germany forced us to open our borders, because of refugee rights blabla. Blackmailing human lives is bad, but bribing another country to keep is them is also wrong. I have always said, we should create a buffer zone in Syria and place them there. But then people say we are changing demographics of Syria...."

europe,fnw8jhs,t1_fnw59tr,1587313564.0,"I genuinely started to believe some of you people love to state the fact that Turkey will not be joining the EU out of any context, maybe you‚Äôre believing we want it so much and there is some sort of satisfaction for you to say No?

Tell me any other example similar to Turkey-Eu case, custom unions, aids and fundings, partnerships, anything on par. You won‚Äôt find. This falls into a category in my opinion as ‚Äúalmost a member.‚Äù 

EU is having huge trade volumes with China, but I doubt they are ‚Äúaiding‚Äù each other. 

For this journalism case, I hate to engage talks with people who has limited knowledge about Turkey. It feels like I have any shit idea about French dynamics but I keep talking and bashing France because my newspapers shallowly mentioned some stuff about it. 

This liberalism, but for the sake of liberalism thing is very common between Europeans. The journalists Turkey jails would be also jailed & raided in America as well, with same terrorism charges. Would you jail a journalist and his politician friend if you catch them escorting an ISIS militant to airport for example? Would you jail a journalist who hacks minister‚Äôs mail and leak classified state info to public with hopes to make current government look bad? Would you ban a newspaper makes an advertisement starting with a heavy SIREN sound rings in the cities following a baby smile, that you would be like, what the fuck is this, then only after exact 9 months there is military coup try by the same people who owned that media. 

These things happened in Turkey, and most fled outside, and of course, nobody will give a fuck about details and say ‚Äúbut they are journalists‚Äù for the sake of liberalism who makes journalists somehow pillars of democracy. 

From an already developed country where everyone is wealthy, it‚Äôs very easy to say stuff like ‚Äúyou jail terrorists because you dictatorship‚Äù blabla. I am sorry, Turkey is not on that level. I would be okay to read some leftist magazines or whatsoever, because I already know they all want the best for our already nice country, but when you‚Äôre in doubts if they‚Äôre funding some militants from the income of magazine who will blow themselves in order to carve out another state within your state, you would also probably say ‚Äúfuck it, lock em up.‚Äù"
europe,fnvwr5h,t1_fnvgu6l,1587306576.0,"I really wonder what Romania would become if it had the same geopolitical and army power that Turkey had. 

Instead of being jealous, you can get another perspective. Turkey is not EU member but an almost one, at the same time. And it has bigger trade with Europe and partnership than Romania alongside its much bigger population. 

People tend to think once the money is sent to Ankara, Erdogan is directly spending it for his anti EU campaign or whatsoever but EU has many organizations within every country to hold and distribute the budget."

Some people like me are not bad in this game to play public, they are good, but they cant memorize HARD POINTS, very less game asks for this type of memorizing if you think about it. Just show
it with light grey marker on the second and believe me even noobs will try to play more
