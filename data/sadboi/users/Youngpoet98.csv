AskReddit,fpr1a75,t3_gey3tk,1588838857.0,"Church camp. Something happened every year. Once a tick burrowed into my leg and I thought it was a scab until I picked it off and it crawled away. One of the locations we stayed at was also pretty bad, there were spiders everywhere and all the kids said it was haunted (I have an irrational fear of spiders and the graffiti didn't help ease the suspicion of ghosts). Lastly, I almost drowned and the pastor's husband had to help me out of the water. I know these are multiple things but they are sort of related."

Now I have to hear them talk on the phone and be hyper aware when they're in the room together (next to mine). I told him I couldn't be his friend because it hurt too much, but now I regret it. I feel so alone and I'm trying to be happy for her and erase my feelings for him, but I miss his presence dearly."

Anxiety,fcwkwon,t3_ej29di,1578028465.0,"I've had this conversation many times with my therapist. My issue is that I become mentally and physically exhausted while only working part-time, and I worry that I will never get to the point where I feel comfortable working full time. It makes me feel like I'm not actually being an adult.

She says that's not true, and that not everyone one is cut out to work full time. I live with a roommate and that already saves a load of money. According to my therapist, as long as I am making enough money to pay my bills then I am doing okay. If I need  or want a little extra money I can pick up another part time with more flexible hours. 

If you don't feel that you can continue working full time, find ways to cut spending in certain areas so you can survive on a part time salary. 

Good luck!"
