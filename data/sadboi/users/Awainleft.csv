So Dior’s Sauvage is always poplair despite its god awful advert, Million by Paco Robanne is a good one and I personally like a lot of the Diesel ones. 
Prada do some really nice men’s ones as do Gucci and these smell quite strong so although they can be pricey a little bit will go a long way. 

If you don’t mind spending a little on one of these then they are all really good and maybe just look at it as an investment in yourself! Hugo Boss do some good ones too and you can sometimes get these on a discount. Maybe ask your female fiend which ones she’s likes out of those - when you go shopping you can spray a few for her to smell!"
Advice,fbf18ln,t3_ed11cn,1576798953.0,"I can’t answer all of these but will try with some - (24F btw!)

In terms of hair, i believe it’s a fair bit cheaper for guys to get their hair cut- but depends how you have it I think anyway? If you can afford to and it’s short I’d imagine maybe every few weeks would keep it looking smarter but I’m sure you could go longer (can always ask them to do your facial hair when you’re there too!) but I really think it depends on the cut and style and how quick your hair grows. 


Some girls like stubble so again I think it varies as to how clean shaven you want to look- you might dry out your skin or get more ingrown hairs if you shave too often.  My brother grows facial hair really quickly and has to shave super often. 

Washing your hair, I personally don’t wash mine with every shower because it dries out my scalp and hair! You can normally get an idea of when your hair needs washing just by looks- try not to let it look greasy. 

I personally love shopping for guys so I definitely think ask a female friend and try and be open with their suggestions! 

With cologne it depends how much you want to spend but I have some suggestions I know I like and are popular with other girls. 

Keep your nails short and not scratchy or sharp. I can’t tell you how important it is to me for nails to not be long. 

Chapstick I would use only if you’re lips feel dry or chapped. The best ones are ones that are made with beeswax, I’m thinking your American but if you have Nivea then these are good too but a favourite of mine is Burts Bees if you guys have it over there! I know lots of people like Carmex if you can get that. 

Hopefully this helps somewhat! Let me know if I can clear any of this up 😀"

This list is pretty much the sort of options I feel I have. 

Problem is with the first one is that I know he would definitely care. He asked me multiple times if anything happened between me and H and I’ve always said no because nothing ever has but he has told me before that even if I am to hang out with H without him he won’t speak to either of us anymore. 

I’m sure he thinks he has some sort of ownership over me in someway and I do appreciate his friendship but I’m finding this so frustrating. 

I know it’s probably wrong to go ahead and sleep with his friend but I can’t help but want to. 
I think my main issue is that I know my ex cares about me a lot and he is always trying to convince me we should be together. I know how much it would upset him so I just can’t see how I could tell him without him really flipping out"

depression,es70xct,t1_es6m45k,1561661574.0,I think it’s really hard being single and dealing with this. I’ve been quite happily single for a while but it’s starting to hit me that I feel quite alone
depression,es62w0q,t1_es62u7u,1561638815.0,I wish I could help but all I can do is eat when I feel like it even if it’s a tiny amount. I’m not getting nearly enough calories and I’m underweight now and I’m sure it makes me feel worse
depression,es62s83,t3_c6381d,1561638719.0,"I get this sort of thing to. I’ve lost two stone because I don’t feel like eating anything and I don’t know how to change it. 

I feel sick all the time and don’t know what to do but I’m sure it’s the depression"
depression,es4eg96,t1_es4clpg,1561582994.0,So sorry to hear that. I really hope things do improve. I think with myself I don’t even recognise happiness. I manage to turn anything that should be positive into a negative or depressive thought
depression,es47nrq,t1_es451vu,1561578833.0,"Yeah it’s definitely hard to keep it going. Really hope you manage to keep it up, I really admire anyone who battled through this and finds positives in any of it. 

I think I find it really hard trying to make myself stay busy and then I just blame myself more because I’ve made myself feel worse"
depression,es4379c,t1_es432wp,1561576132.0,"I need to get better at this for sure. I have parts of the day where I just feel desperate and terrible but I’ll just go and lie down and do nothing. 

Thank you, I will try my best"
depression,es424k3,t1_es41otc,1561575474.0,"Yeah i defintely agree with that. My problem is that it’s almost like I purposely make myself spend time  alone with my thoughts. 

I chose to just lie in bed and do nothing even though I know it doesn’t make me feel any better but I don’t know how to stop it. I feel like the depression has taken hold of my life and all of my interests"
Type1Diabetes,es044za,t3_c0dkiw,1561465034.0,"I totally get this. Been diabetic for 21 years now and I’m 24. 

I’ve been battling depression due to the diabetes and the fact that I’ve not been taking care of myself as well as I should. I’m terrible at taking my long acting insulin and I never test my sugars. 

One thing I can say is that I’m trying to get back on track and it’s important to take pride in the little victories. Diabetes is a stupid bitch and it puts you through a lot. 

I know for sure when my sugars are running high it affects my body badly as well as my mental state. I know how easy it is just to not take a shot or just to avoid testing but I can only advise to try and take one thing at a time and try and remind yourself that these little things you have to do will make you feel better in the long run. 

Sorry you’re going through such a tough time but try not to beat yourself up, you didn’t choose to have this and it’s hard on all of us to deal with."
AskMenAdvice,eruqvih,t1_ert7kdd,1561294041.0,Yeah I think maybe it does come across just as friendly! It always just seems as though I’m putting people off before I even get to speak to them but think I just need to be a bit braver
AskMenAdvice,eruqu26,t1_ert5wnu,1561293994.0,Hahahaa amazing comment! Thank you!
