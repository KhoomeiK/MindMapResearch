Continue to express your feelings and worries because keeping them in can make things worse. That can be through journaling, talking with people or therapy.

...Because I totally thought the second half was going to be super explosions and like a edm song since the beginning was peaceful. 

It's really cool though. Another idea, play with color and color tones when making a juxtaposition. 

Great job! Beautiful storytelling."

Go even more with the voice. Be over the top and play with the volume of how to you speak. The reading is a little monotone. You can also play with the speed of how you speak and give dramatic pauses before you say ""the big shocker"".

I know someone mentioned cut aways, and that's a way to go, but I don't think that's absolutely necessary, just an artistic choice. If you've never watched John Oliver or Hasan minhaj or anyone like them, check them out. They have really good pacing, and they are on camera most of the time.

Pacing was pretty good, except I didn't think you need as many stabbings or need to spend as much duration on each stabbing, especially cuz the reaction didn't really change or get  bigger.

Make more eye contact and cheat to face the camera more so we can see your reactions. There are good faces there, but they're either away from us, or your chins are tilted down so the light disappears on your faces.

I think your intro is a little stiff, and you sound more relaxed when we don't see you. That just takes time and practice. Talking into a camera is awkward.

I have a question/suggestion for you. The pictures moving around are a lot, but are you trying to make the movements to the beat? If you aren't, maybe this is something that you can try. It almost looks like your drawings are dancing, so why not make it to the beat? As a viewer, I think it may be satisfying.

Also, keep going for the variation of speed durations in the clip. Using speed and animation is cool, but it can be too much. Also, consider making bigger shifts in movement, like literally move the paper 3 inches away instead of half inch movements. I hope that makes sense.

Good luck!"

Please give yourself time and patience. Recovery is a whole other beast. I tell my boyfriend that my head just used to be filled with voices that verbally abused me all day. With therapy, I learned why this was and now I have voices fighting the abusive ones.

That's great, but now, there are just more voices in my head. It's cognitive dissonance and it hurts. It hurts and I get tired a lot, but this is better than me just telling myself I'm a worthless piece of dookie all the time. My ""nice"" voices are getting stronger learning how to shut the meaner in one's down faster.

People don't talk about recovery enough and how messy it is. It's made me feel like I wasn't recovering at all, just failing. I am better though. My life still feels hard but it's no where near as hard as 5 years ago.

It super sucks that you have already gone through so much, and the truth is that there are AHs out there that are not compassionate who make you feel worse.

I've been fortunate to find out that not everyone is like this. So I try my hardest to make sure I just don't become an AH because there are nice people out and there and a lot of people like us who were just continuously crapped on.
