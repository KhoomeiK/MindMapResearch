depression,foijca5,t3_g76n13,1587788082.0,I’ve always secretly wanted to go to jail or prison so I could sleep all day bc I’m always so intensely tired.
Nootropics,fohghch,t1_fft40se,1587765583.0,Well said thank you. Mitragyna Speciosa has saved my life. This is after 15 years of prescription meds (lexapro) and therapy that barely helped.
Nootropics,fohe4d7,t1_fmk5ame,1587764420.0,In my experience depression is a chemical imbalance. I have bouts of depression with no external cause.
BravoRealHousewives,foh90cw,t1_fofow5i,1587762034.0,I agree I am not attracted to her type of figure at all
BravoRealHousewives,foh8tnq,t1_fogouz4,1587761950.0,Lmao! Exactly! On point
horseracing,foh803n,t3_g6r0pl,1587761571.0,Thanks everybody!
horseracing,foe7m9m,t1_fodx9c2,1587697664.0,Thanks!
horseracing,fodwi94,t1_focd8ja,1587691459.0,What happened?
horseracing,fodvfxw,t1_fod5qt3,1587690875.0,Thank you meatwe01. After hearing back from everyone on here I think you are correct. I am 41 but I moved around a lot last year so I think verifying my address was not automatic for them whereas my dad has lived at the same address for 15 years.
horseracing,fobwzr7,t1_fobv9yi,1587664599.0,Thank you for the quick response cylon1969. I have been receiving email correspondence from player.services@twinspires.com which look and sound legitimate. I am 41 years old with plenty of credit history or public information to verify my identity. I am waiting to hear back the answer to this question via email and will update my post upon conclusion. I agree it sounds fishy! @cylon1969 have you ever withdrawn money from your TwinSpires account? Did they require proof of identity at that time? I can’t even sign into my account until they receive my proof of identity (all three documents as I mentioned in my  original post).
horseracing,fobsaws,t3_e6jx69,1587663131.0,"Hi everybody! I signed up for an account with TwinSpires and they require me to upload my drivers license, ss card, and proof of address. My father signed up for an account and is already placing bets without having to upload any proof of identity. Anybody know why this would be? I am very confused by this. Thank you!"
bravo,fo5evfv,t1_fo5emst,1587523966.0,Will she not accept help from her family?
bravo,fo52l41,t1_fo51tzt,1587516154.0,"I watched it on Att.tv they had it after Bravo ran a marathon a few weeks ago. It’s actually rather boring, but something new to me to binge a whole season (8 episodes)."

BravoRealHousewives,fo4u2yu,t1_fn2mmtp,1587511226.0,She has a profile on there too that you can link to from his page but it doesn’t reveal much. Good job finding his page.
RHOBH,fo4h9fj,t3_g25jmn,1587504390.0,"I thought she was at least 60 years old until today I was listening to Heather McDonald’s podcast where she says she is 48! I’m shocked. I thought she was older based on the way she looks, acts, and is out of shape. She looked terrible in that DG outfit omg."
90DayFiance,fo1m13z,t3_fal4gt,1587436245.0,I’m reading everywhere about people being (justifiably) angry at TLC for giving this abuser a platform. I’m surprised more people are not angry at TLC for not giving Varya a proper warning about this guy and disclosing his criminal record to her before filming so that she could have made a decision based on all of the facts.
jerseyshore,fmez87m,t3_fqepxy,1586016702.0,I was wondering the same thing! She used it before mike and Lauren’s wedding and then her fiancé made a joke and said spray my butt lol. I was wondering what it is. She said it helps with swearing down there. Was it just spray deodorant? It definitely cannot be healthy for your vagina as gynos suggest never using such products.
TrueCrime,fl8t59y,t1_fghfqed,1584931664.0,Exactly! Opportunists. They were more devoted to their religious righteousness and their church then their own son.
TrueCrime,fl8sykz,t1_fhnzk9y,1584931533.0,I was thinking the exact same thing. Instead of fighting for him to get him help it sounds like they judged him for his substance abuse which was just him self medicating bc his parents forced religion on him instead of real help like a psychiatrist.
13or30,filugns,t3_f5kjnt,1582510623.0,How old is he? So unbelievable that this is a 48 year old father of three. Does he do Botox? I thought he was the brother!
13or30,filucfs,t3_f6mmgs,1582510541.0,I can’t get over how young this man looks he looks younger than Peter. Botox?
BravoRealHousewives,fdrkrtz,t3_emvdvl,1578685871.0,Nobody addresses the fact that Kary always refers to herself as a strong Mexican and consistently uses her nationality as proof that she is worldly and cultured. It is true that LeeAnne heard Kary speak this way of herself and could have been mimicking her because she was angry with her. I’m interested to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks.
