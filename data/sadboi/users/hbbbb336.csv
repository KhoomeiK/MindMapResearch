Anxiety,eyemi7g,t3_cwre4s,1567035872.0,i hope it helps you in all the ways you’re searching for! i really really know what you mean with the whole “my mind has exhausted me” thing. i would really like to get up the courage to go to a psychiatrist. i know my family is so annoyed with me blowing their phones up with every irrational thought begging for reassurance from me haha
WomensHealth,ey8eg1z,t1_ey8dhi1,1566918203.0,"Oh no, what is the LEEP procedure? is it necessary after getting a colposcopy? i just want to be done with it all! i’m so sorry that it was painful for you as well!! no one even offered for me to look at the screen and i probably wouldn’t have either given the chance. i’m still having some bleeding but it’s been 5 days. it’s going away though. just such an awful experience"
