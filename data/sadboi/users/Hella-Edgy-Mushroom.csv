BPD,f74b8g2,t1_f73vqpb,1573400118.0,That giving up hobbies and expecting them to do the same thing. Hit me just now. I am an artist and I give up my art all the time to see my FP happy. But he wouldn’t ever consider giving up his photography. *Not that he should.*
BPD,f74ay0u,t1_f72xio5,1573399967.0,"I love that response, 😂. 
Duh."
BPD,f74ae3q,t3_du3wt4,1573399855.0,"I relate to this hella, especially a lot lately, my FP (s.o) is a photographer and a father to a wonderful 4 yr old child. I struggle with him around women all the time.. but It’s especially bad for me when my jealousy is directed at his son..  someone I know, obviously means no harm lol. I *KNOW* that my jealousy is abandonment based, and so putting that together in the setting of his son can be such a *SPLIT* because I feel as though I should be thinking that it’s ridiculous but I also know his son is the center of his life, an unmovable fixture, and I can’t help but desire to be that for him as well."
BPD,f4ozu6d,t1_f4o31q3,1571712247.0,"Issue is I can’t touch the bigger subjects even if they are just blatant theatrics. These things are real to him, because “they’ve made him into who he is” so when it comes to calling those out it’s all aggression immediately, and he’s very visibly hurt I don’t feed into it. :/ I can do small stuff though, and you’re right I guess it will just have to be one of those wait it out for him kinda things.. I just wish he could be honest with me if not anyone else."
sex,f4lktgf,t3_dkzncc,1571668317.0,"Scissoring as it’s known traditionally in porn is really just like a porn thing, there’s not a lot of stimulation that can be received from just wedging your legs in between each other’s and bashing your parts together real fast. but there is such a thing called tribbing, which is like a more “real” version. And I know a few people who actually do implement this into their sex lives. It’s usually slower, and less tangled, most commonly done in like a missionary like position."
sex,f4lj33k,t1_f4lcswe,1571667665.0,"Of course! Ive been there dude! Maybe you just need to be able to have a conversation about it, if possible voice that you feel like you are only capable of as much as you can and you’d like to meet him in the middle somewhere, that’s it’s important to you that he’s getting pleasure too. It sounds like he gets a little disappointed and just gives up on ideas afterwards. And if you feel maybe talking isn’t going to be something productive, try just going all in and just doing some stuff. Trying out your ideas at random with no prompt. Sometimes I’ve noticed asking if they want something durning sex, makes it too real."
sex,f4lbzq4,t3_dkysau,1571665153.0,"That is tricky bc he’s made it clear to you what he wants, and it’s also something that appears to bother you bc you cannot always offer it. Maybe a compromise is in need. I suffer UTIs commonly too, and so I totally get it, and sometimes I really don’t want to because of it. but I recently have found ways to better enjoy penetrative sex. During and after.  We’ve found this position that I really like, where we take it slowly, and he stimulates my clit, he gets me off that way first, and then it makes the inside sensitive enough in the right way to orgasm a few more times via penetration. I find it helpful always to pee right after. (of course) usually I shower and clean myself up a bit too, with just some water, and sometimes, I down some cranberry juice just for the hell of it. I suffer to them less consistently when I’m on top of the peeing and showering right after most often. If you feel like you’re getting enough stimulation, and it’s just that you really feel sometimes you can’t handle penetration, When I could not do it I found it helpful to use toys, like flesh lights, a better flesh light and some lube does wonders. it’s important if you’re going to do that though, to put on a bit of a show I’ve found lol, even if you’re not super into it, if it’s you he likes seeing get off that gets him off, it helps to show your excited about his pleasure. Moaning, or just letting go and getting into it. That could be the key to the kingdom too, just finding things to do that show him you’re enjoying whatever y’all are doing."
BPD,f20xqwf,t3_db1uy4,1569865348.0,I loved this I’ve actually played it a few times and sent it to a few friends!
BPD,f1ycap0,t3_db1mqk,1569813659.0,Honestly want to know if anyone has managed to take a break from everything and come back to an FP fully capable of handling it.
BPD,extsebk,t1_exsofp0,1566574093.0,"I have never related to anything more in my life, Thank YOU honestly. That’s all I’ve been doing, forgetting who he is and what he’s actually done, and then suddenly being madly in love with him all over again. Wanting him to fuck off but also to never leave me. And the FOG yes, I’m glad you understand what that’s like too... well not actually glad that you have to suffer to it, but you get what I mean lmao. I TOTALLY get that push and pull, I had a conversation with my bf the other day about what I feel like is missing in our relationship and he heard me for a while but I got so switchy bc I couldn’t differentiate what was real or imagined abandonment, or trouble, and then it turned into a full blown argument. I slip up often like that but what I keep trying to tell myself is to keep going, and take my time with these issues. Try not to listen to those parts of your mind, when you’re feeling like you have something to talk about, sit down with it and think on it the best you can, give it a few days if you have to, log it, keep track of it, if it changes with the days, it might not be as big as it feels, if it doesn’t it might be a real issue.  In which case find a day that you know you’re clear to talk about it. I haven’t mastered this yet bc I’m impatient and impulsive, something always NEEDS to be done now, but in the few times I’ve successfully done it it’s been beautifully productive. The best thing that has ever worked for me is to just give it actual days, because I clear up and fog out in such a seesawish way lol. Learning how long it takes for you to fall in and out of it is helpful too. I’ll tell you something also. if he decides to go anywhere because you’ve just simply expressed a few feelings, and this is hella cliche but true, that says a lot more about him then it will ever say badly about you."
BPD,exqrbep,t1_exqqm2v,1566506380.0,"Not much at all tbh, I visit my therapist once weekly but she hasn’t offered me much perspective other the it’s all probably being triggered by what’s happened. Doesn’t seem to matter to my FP  though."

BPD,exqayif,t3_cu077z,1566500095.0,"I’ve been feeling like this all day, does anyone else get this when they aren’t getting attention? Or have it to the extreme that you get so caught up in the fog that you can’t even remember what you like about them or if you’ve ever actually liked them at all?"
BPD,exqap1u,t1_expzhf5,1566500002.0,I have been feeling like this all day it’s sooo fucking relieving that I’m not the only one.
BPD,ewsc5ri,t1_ewnsqc1,1565724458.0,"I try very often to do things to center myself and think about things logically but when I’m lost to it, or having an extreme episode no sense of logic seems to do it for me. I become paranoid, or convinced that the way I am feeling is the way I do all the time. And sometimes when I’ve finished, and am more clear headed, I’m still left wondering whether or not feeling like that was important, or if it was just purely a product of my mind."
