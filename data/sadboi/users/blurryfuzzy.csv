Since Jesus is integral to the Trinity (would God be less than God or the same God without this integral part of God?) and Catholic soteriology hinges on the real death of Jesus as recompense for the fall of man and our personal sins, I'd have to reexamine everything, of course. 

I think I would try to work backwards, in a sense. Like, what aspects of practicing and believing in Catholicism are critically impacted if Jesus did not exist as a historical figure? How do Scripture and Tradition support the idea of Jesus Christ the Messiah as a non-physical human? If Jesus was not a physical human person, why did God divinely inspire the authors of Scripture in the Old and New Testaments to write about a non-human Savior as if he were a physical person? Why would God offer promises throughout history of a human Messiah if it was all figurative? Who is our Messiah? Do we need a Messiah or salvation? If there was no physical sacrifice as penance for sins, can sins be forgiven? Does sin exist?

Would it be possible to consider that the Messiah hadn't arrived yet, and then follow Judaism? I don't know, and I have a gut feeling right now of ""no I wouldn't follow Judaism"". But if I did, would that still constitute an abandonment of the faith? Yes.

This was definitely not an exhaustive list of questions."

>God allows suffering, without ""getting anything"" out of it, and therefore values the suffering

I guess I also don't understand why you think *allowing* something is the same thing as or necessitates *valuing* it, because it seems like your arguments stem from this assumption. Allowing something doesn't necessitate valuing it. I can allow my friend to get an abortion (in that I don't physically prevent her from going though I would try to dissuade her), but I don't value the act or the outcome. I allow my pre-teen son to go out in the freezing cold without a jacket (despite trying to reason with him, i find it better he learns how cold it is for himself), but I don't value his discomfort. Allowing something to happen simply grants that people can make their own decisions and face the consequences of that. But these are just the things we can control. Just as God can control all things.

Your point about the fetus not making moral decisions in a way that exposes it to understanding God's love in the way that fully grown people do is well taken, so let's consider this: despite suffering original sin like we all do, babies have inherent free will but may die having made no moral decision to act against God. Now neither scripture nor tradition have offered assumptions about who goes to Heaven and when, but for the sake of this thought experiment, let's assume momentarily that babies go straight to heaven. When in Heaven, babies will experience God's love in their own capacity, just as adults will experience God's love in their own capacity, and it is nevertheless perfect.

>God can allow us to understand his love without requiring us to use make moral choices on Earth which open us up to harmful or unpleasant consequences and suffering. If he could do that for an aborted or naturally stillborn fetus, then surely he could do it for any other human being.

Sure. God could do this, because he can do it for babies as we've established, but he won't because unlike babies, we have had the opportunity to make moral decisions stemming from our free will and we deserve the opportunities to choose better and to atone during our lifetimes. And as I said in an earlier comment, He has reasons for why we suffer in the ways that we do, whether directly related to moral behavior or not. So, I still maintain my implied position that we can *better* understand God and Love through our trials and tribulations.

>Since you argue we cannot have free will without evil/suffering...

I did not argue for this, but if I implied it, I hope I've clarified above by establishing that babies are born with free will and fetuses in the womb have inherent free will, but evil is in no way necessary for them to have it. God has gifted it to them prior to any moral behavior. So, I'm afraid you have the relationship backwards. We literally need free will in order for moral evil to exist in the first place. Moral evil entered the world because we expressed our free will first. So your question of ""I asked if we had free will in heaven...So then is there evil and suffering in heaven?"" is no longer applicable. We still possess free will in an environment where our love for God now perfectly responds to God's love for us. This alignment leads to no suffering; ""the former things have passed away"" (Rev 21:4).

So following your logic and circling back to the original question, why does God allow bad things to happen on earth \[when Heaven has none and we can experience God's love fully\]? I will admit, as you suggest, that we won't always understand it. Sometimes people interpret these things individually as they must, but there is no unifying and objective explanation (other than the Fall of humankind) as to why God permits bad to happen. As I said in my very first comment, ""it requires faith in God’s goodness to pull us through to see that there is another side to bad events."" Things don't always make sense to us, but they make sense to God in some way.

I appreciate your intellectual sincerity in this discussion.

CatholicMemes,fhhuaty,t1_fhglmya,1581611896.0,"Nothing I have said here is unreasonable or nonsensical in the whole context of Catholic theology, which requires more study than what you readily find in a cursory search on Reddit. But let me try to be as explicit as possible:

Stopping bad things is absolutely within God’s control. God is not limited by laws of the universe because God is the creator of the universe. That being said, God does what God wants. God does not do things that God does not want to do. God has reasons for the things he chooses to do, some of which we understand, some of which we partially understand, and some of which we don’t understand at all. This is does not imply that God is limited in what God does; it shows that God has reason and will and acts as God sees fit in his omniscience. We also have reason and will, but WE are limited because we don’t have perfect understanding or wisdom like God does.

We can assume that, because God IS a perfectly loving entity, God values (and therefore WANTS) that which is good for our souls and leads to our benefit, and God has literally perfect understanding and wisdom of all things and their consequences. 

Does this mean God is limited and cannot want bad things because they’re bad? Is he limited by his own goodness? It’s a “yes, but definitely no” kind of answer. To say that God is limited because he doesn’t value bad for the sake of bad is to assert that God is something He is not, which is nonsensical. God is not unloving, so valuing bad for the sake of bad is unloving and therefore not God. So if you want to say that God is limited by his own goodness, it’s not wrong, but it’s still definitely not right. God simply can’t be what God is not. Just like I cannot be you and you cannot be me, and a square cannot be a circle, and a skyscraper can’t be a starfish.

I truly believe we will understand everything once we enter Heaven and we will have free will because we cannot truly love God without free will, and in Heaven we are finally able to share in God’s perfect love. 

If you are interested in the spiritual destination of fetuses or people who may not seemingly have the capacity to make moral decisions, I would recommend you start another thread and look for answers in good faith.

Edit: (to add) It IS within God’s power to show us goodness and love without any suffering or bad, but God intentionally chooses—for whatever specific reasons that we may or may not understand—this specific means of allowing us to experience His love and goodness. God does not act without good intention."
CatholicMemes,fhgi3we,t1_fhgd0kt,1581567744.0,"I'm not sure what words you want to hear. God permits but doesn't *need* evil to happen. He didn't need it when he created the world and goodness abounded at that time. However, because of the Original Sin, it does happen on its own, God in his own way now reveals deeper meanings and opportunities for understanding Him through these experiences.

If God forced everything to be good and perfect all the time (after Original Sin), what cause would we have to understand God's love at all? How do we understand the beauty and the greatness of God's whole creation if we have no bad to compare it to? By permitting bad things (which result from humankind's free decision to turn away from Love in the first place), we have the opportunity to understand the love that God has for us and to be grateful to God in turn. And this is why God permits bad to happen.

Can God force the good without the bad? Yes, but doing so would limit our freedom, which is contrary to perfect love and thus contrary to God; and why would God--who is perfect in Love, Mercy, Justice, and Goodness--go against Himself who is perfection?"

I get that this is the most explicit and obvious way that good came about as a result of God permitting something bad to happen, but it shouldn’t be discounted for not being more subtle. In this example, Christ’s death revealed to us how much God loves us. It also modeled the ideal of Christian suffering for us. 

The problem for us usually is that we don’t always understand God’s will whether it’s active or passive. So it requires faith in God’s goodness to pull us through to see that there is another side to bad events. But I have to wonder if it’s never an equivalent good-for-bad in the way that we might think. What if, like in the above example, the bad is allowed so that we can come to greater understanding of God and ourselves and what God is trying to reveal to us about the universe."

That would be like discussing the implications for morality if Mary was a man. She wasn’t, per God’s will, so discussing the alternative would be pointless because that would necessitate like a reconstruction of Catholic theology and assuming God’s intentions in another reality, which we are not really able to do. 

This issue with this TED talk is that—as the speaker himself says—the scientific study of sexual orientation/homosexuality is as yet so so small.. “in its infancy.” So we can hardly say there is a definitive evolutionary basis for homosexuality in the way that the speaker is intimating. In a way, he’s mythologizing sexual orientation as something evolutionarily necessary or mythologizing non-hetero sexual orientation as being like a super power.

Additionally, the studies he presented focus on male sexuality, which is only half of the topic. Had he presented findings on female sexuality, his talk would have had more “external validity” in a sense. How can we say that a greater number of sons per family leads to an LGBT son without discussing the possibility that had that last son been a daughter, she would have been LGBT? Data and research conclusions that generalize about a whole population of people are not reliable if they are hardly representative of the overall population.

The speaker discusses the event of trauma or hardship during pregnancy, which absolutely can alter the expression of certain genetic traits. However, a recent massive study came to a conclusion that there is no “gay gene”—a gene that determines sexuality (see here: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02585-6).  Do events during pregnancy activate genes that affect our social behavior? Yes, for example hardship can affect the mental health not only of immediate offspring but also the offspring of offspring, i.e. intergenerational trauma (see here: https://www.nature.com/articles/tp2017153). 

But to say that stress during pregnancy causes a non-existent gay gene to be activated because you “need someone clever to help keep the family together” as the speaker says, is inaccurate. Perhaps genes related to oxytocin or serotonin sensitivity are turned on, or perhaps an aversion to or preference for something is activated at the epigenetic level.

So, in sum, there is not enough support showing that non-hetero sexuality has evolutionary underpinnings. Consequently, we cannot discuss the morality or immorality of a non-existent thing.

Was a little awkward, but these things happen. I guarantee you are not alone in feeling how you’re feeling.

Sexual intimacy has unitive and pro-creative purposes. There is no unity with a partner in solo sexual stimulation, just as there is no possibility of being open to life (thus “pro-creative”). However, if you were to touch yourself while engaged in sex with your spouse, be aware if the intended result is still open to life (i.e. it would be wrong to do this as a form of contraception or without there being any possibility of conceiving, but if you are doing this WITH your spouse to perhaps help them understand what you need, it is likely not wrong. Intentions are important, and God understands our intentions.)"

Catholicism,fdo0thk,t3_embz51,1578596783.0,"Hi, I’m sorry for your struggle, and I hope you find the answers you’re looking for. 

From a spiritual standpoint:

Perhaps this helps—sexual impulse is neither good nor bad, and our sexuality is a gift from God. But it can be disordered or misused.

When the occasion arises where we are tempted or when we begin to feel turned on, it helps to thank God for the sexuality you have and then to ask God in that moment to help you use your sexuality in spiritually healthy and beneficial ways. “God, thank you for this gift of sexuality. Help me to be responsible with this gift and to use it wisely and to my greater spiritual benefit.”

Besides acknowledging sexuality as natural and God-given, we also need to understand that things like masturbation or looking at porn are HABITS that we form. It’s important to understand what triggers these actions and either avoid those triggers or neutralize the threat. Habits can be hard to break, and it takes a good deal of self-discipline to break them, especially when the immediate reward is so enjoyable. Even if we break the habit, we are not immune to falling down again, but of course, that is what confession is for :) but if you truly want to conform your will to God’s will, you will find that willpower within you. It takes time. 

Personal experience in a non-religious context: 

(disclaimer: this was during a time when I was NOT living according to Church teaching, which I don’t advise because it was spiritually numbing and filled with painful cognitive dissonance) Masturbation made it difficult for me to enjoy intimacy with my partner in that I knew what I liked, but when my partner was not able to do precisely as I was used to doing, it threw off the whole thing and made sex with him less enjoyable. There was no learning how to be sexually intimate WITH the other person, and it felt more like a “do this for me this way” kind of exchange. What I mean to say is, there was a lack of togetherness in it. This is just my experience.

DebateACatholic,fcls7k4,t1_fclqz6v,1577755184.0,"I don’t think they believe in Transubstantiation, which is the foundation of a valid participation in the Eucharist at Mass.

Additionally, words in themselves have meaning and, consequently, power. For example, this is why people are encouraged to speak with political correctness because the words we use have the power to hurt others or perpetuate systemic social ills. In a similar way, the Catholic Church acknowledges that the words and order of words used in our sacraments have specific meanings and power in those meanings. When the “formulas” are changed, as they are in different denominations, the validity of a sacrament may be altered. I don’t know the specifics of Episcopalian sacraments, but this is one example of how we can consider what is valid or not."
DebateACatholic,fclrgc6,t3_eht12t,1577754669.0,"From what I understand, the Episcopalian Church  is perhaps the closest in liturgy and belief system to Catholicism (excluding a communion or unity under the pope). In fact, there is an “ordinariate” within the Catholic Church called the Anglican Ordinariate (a practice much like Eastern Rite or Roman Rite) that has developed as a result of Anglicans who have entered or plan to enter into communion with Rome. Anglican ordinariate parishes and churches are officially part of the Catholic Church. 

Fun fact: Saint John Henry Newman is revered in the Anglican, Episcopalian, and Catholic churches for his immense understanding of Christianity despite his conversion from Anglicanism to Catholicism.

It opens up a entirely unnecessary can of worms. Like he won’t feel the same way, so what good is that information to him, you know? It’s burdensome information.

Ultimately, it’s important to understand where these feelings come from. For example, is he the biggest source of emotional support you have in your life right now? When I was crushing on a coworker I realized that I was relying on him for emotional support that I could get elsewhere. Please try to look elsewhere for emotional support! It’s more difficult making close friends in adulthood, but not impossible. I’ve met some really close and emotionally supportive friends using BumbleBFF.
