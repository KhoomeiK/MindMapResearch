You get an extra projectile for every element you are using, so try to get all 5 or at least 4 (only Amara can easily do this due to Infusion). It also needs to ricochet as much as possible to deal a lot of damage, which is why Amara works so well with it (Indiscriminate for more ricochets and Ties that Bind with Allure to bring enemies together). It also makes a pretty big difference if you have a x1 or x2 Recursion and if the initial shot is a crit, the rest of the projectiles do increased damage too."

The best setup I have for boss fights to not take ages requires one very specific gun roll and good aim to even try. A Yellowcake (or other strong launcher, this just has highest base damage and a slow projectile) and a 300% under 90% health Unforgiven (if you don't know, the 300/90 anoint applies on hit like crit damage, so you can crit swap for it). Its pretty hard to hit correctly since the Yellowcake projectile arcs and splits. Fl4k could probably do it much better but I need to finish levelling him first.

Apparently mayhem 10 loot drop rates are god awful despite having a +2500% modifier (wouldn't be surprised if there was a cap in that modifier that causes it to loop back to zero for some reason). Mayhem loot has no indication of its level. Mayhem loot does not drop from chests, or affect quest rewards or mail items, for whatever reason, just f*** those weapons I guess. I don't know how there are so many screw-ups for things that should be obvious.
