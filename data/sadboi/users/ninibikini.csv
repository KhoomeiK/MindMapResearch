ShaneDawson,evxm84y,t1_evvlmzq,1564897572.0,"I get what you’re saying. Maybe Billie Eilish wasn’t the best example, but I do get what you mean. It’s just the little things that add up. Like him wanting to feel young by doing what’s trendy with generation Z. Then again, a good portion of his audience is young, so I could see why he wants to still appeal to them. Nevertheless, it transcends from “just youtube” to his real life. “Omg me / im trash / tea”, for another example."
ShaneDawson,evuomsn,t1_evuehzz,1564801303.0,"My thoughts exactly! Shane does videos with this rich, out of touch, LA youtubers and praises them for all their gucci, g-wagons, and mansions. I wanna see REAL, related people documented!"

EDanonymemes,etmfj8r,t3_ccezwm,1562958776.0,!! Exactly. Let’s get rid of subreddits like ProED but not get rid of subreddits like FatLogic. Obviously a community for people struggling with eating disorders looking for support is more detrimental than a community of people hating overweight people.

EDAnonymous,etbmsh3,t3_cav08c,1562652461.0,"On a lighter note, “shit post” could have been a fitting flair for this post. 

Jokes aside, drink lots of water, get your electrolytes in (powerade zero or something), and please try to refrain from abusing [stimulant] laxatives as they damage your digestive system overtime and you will develop a dependence. If necessary, try milk of magnesia or a similar gentle laxative. Stay safe. 💕"
