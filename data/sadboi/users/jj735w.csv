Anxiety,f7ekqyt,t3_dv999g,1573659883.0,It's difficult to say. I'm still anxious in large groups but I've benefited from taking beta-blockers as prescribed by my GP. I also know to try and cut some of my thinking short before it makes me feel nauseated and worked up. I definitely think that it helps to try and bring your focus back to your environment and the present. I wish I had more answers OP.
Anxiety,f7bsx5k,t3_dv999g,1573576881.0,I have had similar experiences with lectures. I felt like I couldn't leave but also couldn't stay where I was. It's really scary at the time and I completely empathise with you as it can really knock your confidence. I support you OP.
Anxiety,f73wiof,t3_dubotu,1573395788.0,I know exactly what you mean. It's like you know that you don't have anything to be afraid of but you feel it so intensely anyway.
Anxiety,f6pvtzz,t3_dsesw7,1573065385.0,Excellent work!
