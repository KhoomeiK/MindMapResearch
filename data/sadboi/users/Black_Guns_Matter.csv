Thankfully, my parents were both right there, and rushed me to the ER for stitches (honestly I probably would have been fine, but I was their first, and the oldest in my generation of my family, so no one really knew how to raise babies yet.) As we were sitting in the hospital, the doc who was about to stitch me up (or maybe he already had? I was 5-6 tops, give me a break) asked how it happened. As my dad (who is the GENTLEST, KINDEST soul in the world, and would go after anyone who hurt me in a heartbeat) started explaining what happened.

Maybe something a little less, depending on your interests/time availability."
depression,eyciqqt,t3_cwa2nl,1567002552.0,"Here's the thing. Well, the thing**s**.

1.) Good people ARE in the world. (Please view the rest of the comments for proof) You just haven't found them yet. Don't give up, and keep looking. Because you WILL find us. Sometimes, you probably come across good people, but sometimes they're also depressed, so they don't talk. Or act nice. Maybe try and make friends with someone quiet? I met my boyfriend while working at the same pet store, and he was the quietest person who worked there, clearly going through some shit. I (kindly) forced him to talk to me, just in baby steps. ""Hey, how are you today?"" ""Hey, what's going on today? Any new store drama?"" And that graduated to me finding out that he went to some event, that he knew SO much about. So on his break, I asked him to tell me all about it, and he REALLY opened up to me. Shortly after that, I needed a new pair of shorts for work. So I asked if he was busy or wanted to get out of the house, and he did. So I took him with me. Then we started hanging out. Then we became best friends. Etc., etc., etc. Point being, **talk to the people who have no one else to talk to**. 

2.) This is actually the most selfless way I've ever heard someone say they want to cease living. That tells me that you ARE selfless, and a GREAT friend, if given the opportunity. So do that. Go be a friend to someone. I've actually found I can almost pull myself out of depression by helping others, to an extent. Don't try to help too many people and get drug down into their hole. I've done that, too. But **try to help someone.** 

3.) It sounds like you love like I do, with your heart exposed, and out for the taking. You love people whole-heartedly, and without hesitation. That's such a good quality, but you just have to be careful. And don't let your heart get broken. I let my guard down and got my heart broke so many times, that I named myself a douchebag, and tried to ""out-douche"" the douchebag guys. ""Oh, you think you're going to f\*ck ME over? Well, try it. I'll leave you before you even walk out the door."" I was a nightmare. Imagine a girl gone frat guy, and that was me. Because I was trying to protect myself. (Which, by the way, who the hell hurt all those fray guys, to make them act like that!?) I certainly DON'T recommend that one, though. It's OKAY to love with your heart on your sleeve! Just, try not to give your heart out to everyone. Or maybe, do. Just have the expectation that you're going to get hurt, and then when someone gives you their heart in return, you'll get shocked. But try to meet NEW people. Background: I was raised by a bunch of egotistical men, that, while being GREAT at raising me, I didn't know that non-douches existed. Then I met my current best friends. I have 4. 5 if you count one of their girlfriends, but that's by extension. And THEY taught me that guys AREN'T always shitty. NOT all guy friends hit on their female friends. Not all guys expect something from every woman they see. Moral of this one, **meet a lot of people, but only keep some. Friends are quality over quantity.**

&#x200B;

TLDR; Don't give up. If you can't not give up for the people currently in your life, or yourself, do it for us. All the strangers on the internet that took the time to care about you, *like you deserve to be cared about.* Good people *are* out there, *find them. Try to help someone today. Say hi to ONE stranger and make them smile.* And don't forget... *Friends are quality over quantity.*  You can do this. We all did, and you can too. We believe in you. And if we can, you should, too."

My thing was that I always knew something about me was ""different"" from the rest of my friends and family, and at one point in high school was actually 100% convinced that my parents were paying my ""friends"" to hang out with me (they weren't). I was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and that was why I would draw back from everyone every now and then, that's why I got more excited than everyone sometimes, and laughed louder. What I thought made me some psycho age-regressed teenage child, was actually mania coming into swing. This part might sound stupid, but getting that diagnosis just lifted a weight off of my conscious. I'm still 100% that person, but knowing *why* I'm that person has allowed me to love myself, *for me.* And it's been the most beautiful transition of my life. I'm not saying yours is caused by an undiagnosed issue, and I hope it's not, because this isn't easy, despite learning to love myself through it.

My advice to you: As easy as this is to say (though much harder to implement), love yourself. Look in the mirror every morning and say it out loud. ""I love you, me."" Make lists of the great things in your life and what you love about yourself. And, find your passion. If you love your hair, work with it. Learn to do cool shit with it. Gardening? Do that. Just do *something* that makes you *feel you again*. You come to notice that when you fall in love with yourself, you come out of the background. You were just an extra in the movie, but then you get a promotion, and you get the lead role. And then, one day, you'll look back over the past few months of your life, and you won't be able to think of a scene in the movie that you weren't the star of. Just, whatever you do, don't give up. Because you *will* become the lead role. You just have to find *you* first."

UIUC,eraw365,t1_eraqfie,1560654364.0,"No discredit at all to NoCandyForTheBabe, but my boyfriend was *involuntarily* admitted to the Pavilion, and hated it. BUT keep in mind it was involuntary. (Voluntary in the sense that he walked in the door on his own, but involuntary in the means that his mom forced him. It‚Äôs been a few years ago now, and was drug-related, though he does also suffer mental illness as well, as do I. So I get it.)  One story that stuck with me though, was that he said one of the oversee-ers (or something) told one of the kids in there they were all there ‚Äúto get prepared for jail.‚Äù That could be the mindset of ONE person, but I felt that it was worth mentioning. Overall, he went back to drugs after getting out, but eventually quit, and has been clean for almost a year now! He has been doing very very well since then, and I think somewhere in his heart he is glad he went. Because it got him out of a VERY bad situation. But I do completely understand that different situations and reasons for admittance will change your personal experience!"
