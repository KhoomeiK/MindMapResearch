AnxietyDepression,f9zu4kb,t1_f9zr29s,1575745469.0,"Thanks for then advice:) You you went through then same things that I am going through right now. I just put up a post today on r/meditation that want you to read but you really don't have to if you don't want to. Long story short: I am struggling with deep regret of an opportunity that I missed and I'm anxious that I might remain like this for the rest of my life. Sorry, i m going to paste the entire post here because I don't know link it. And btw, you sound like you could be quite happy with yourself. I think the only thing that is preventing us both from being happy is expectations to be extrovert and loud. On the last few days on a boat cruise(described in the situation below), I realised that I find myself to be more at peace with myself if I just sit there in silence and listen when I'm with a group of people and I dont feel like trying to talk over everyone and constantly trying not to be labeled as the ""quiet one"". 

The post:

Recent events have filled me with major regret and I can't stop thinking about it. I just came home from a four day party ship cruise for high school graduates that I went on with one of my friends  from primary(middle) school.

Back story(sorry for the long back story but I ask that you please read it to understand the context of my problem) : For the past couple of months I have struggled with the idea of never finding love. I have had a lonely high school career after we moved to a new town in my freshman year. Over the course of high school, I have developed a form of social anxiety and just a common fear for any social interaction or participation in group activities. This was because of a nickname that I got in my freshman year of hs(and now realising that people actually liked me at the start and that I just didnt understand the idea of nicknames as it wasn't really a thing at my previous school). It was associated with the fact that my was a really slow thinker and my ADHD  but I took it way too seriously back then and thought everyone I met would immediately not want like me because of it. Some kids in my class also laughed out loud when was picked as one of the 20 kids in my grade to be recommended to consider advanced maths. That also made me think that I was dumb even though I literally got handpicked as one of the top maths students in my grade. This led acceptance from others being my only focus. My grades has dropped(up until this year when I started to strive again) and my social skills and simple ability to have a conversation has gone down the drain. I used to be the a wholesome and funny kid but I started pushing everyone away and hating the world.

Back to the event that caused this regret: one night on the boat trip, me and my friend stood on the top deck of the boat where the most of the people where dancing in the middle. We stood at the side with our drinks. Next to me stood a girl and I can't remember how our conversation started in the first place but we talked for like 10 minutes straight and it was the most natural conversation that I have ever had. She was the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. She wasnt necessarily hot or anything but she had the most beautiful eyes and I only really focused on her eyes and I have never in my life been so interested in what someone else had to say. We slowly stood closer and closer to one another while we talked and then we stood there singing along with the music(and I know what you're thinking but I was not drunk and I didn't like drinking more than one cocktail a night or getting too drunk). I would usually not act like that but I felt so alive in that moment that I just sang along with her. She the then tucked on my arm because she wanted to dance but my slow assed brain didn't realise that she wanted to dance with me and I just stood there firmly and laughed and sang louder. I thought that she was just urging me too loosen up or something. After that, she told her friend, ""let's go to the club"", and they left. It was only them when I realised what I have done. I proceeded to look for her the entire night and could, understandably, not find her between the 3 000 graduates on the boat. I have never felt so down in my entire life. I went to bed at like 11 already after searching for several hours. I was just lyingn in bed, staring at the the ceiling and hoping that I might bump into her the next day. I never did. Now I am back home and I can't stop thinking about the mistake that I have made. I could've just danced with her and hang out with her that night and probably would've gotten her number. She lives in another province/state so I will probably never see her again.

There is nothing right now that would convince me that I will find someone like her ever again. I can't even talk to girls but with when I was talking to her, it felt like I was so immersed in that moment and sort of like we were in our own world for that 10 or so minutes. I don't even look at other girls anymore. This feeling of regret has left me feeling extremely down and frustrated with myself. I tried meditating again for the first time in a long time but just couldn't stop thinking about that girl and the fact that I might die alone. No matter what I'm busy doing, I just can't enjoy the moment because i cant get her out of my head."

I still have a lot of time."
Meditation,f9zopvm,t1_f9yz4q1,1575743805.0,"I couldn't agree with you more but all this reasonable reasoning can't even make me stop thinking about her. I would give anything just to talk to her again and I just can't get rid of this desparation but I guess there are 2 upsides of this: 

1. I realised that I can actually talk to girls if I just don't try too hard and just be present in the moment

2. This have gotten me back into meditation and mindfulness as I understand the importance of it now"
AnxietyDepression,f9zn1kz,t1_f9ywuup,1575743340.0,"You are actually 100% correct. Through out the cruise, I was trying to talk to and impress girls but was really bad at it but when I met this girl, I had no such intensions. I just stood by the side talking with my friend and she happened to stand next to me talking to her friend and our conversation started more subscounsiously than me trying to think of something to say to start a conversation. But after all this reasonable reasoning, I still can't shake of the feeling that I want to be with her again. I would give anything just to talk to her again. I just can't get rid of this desperation but I guess you're right. I should work on myself and my career and there will be plenty of that next year when I go to university."
