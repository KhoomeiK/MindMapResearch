I'm also part of a team that works completely remote, no-one knows anyone. If the people you work with are passionate and motivated its just a communication that will make it more difficult. But it's hard to find someone that will work as hard and fast on the project like they do in real-life. Most of them already got another job or something too, they won't give it up for the project you want to build with them.

If you're interested, I'm setting up r/onlinecollective. It's completely focused on building projects with strangers online and testing out the best way to collaborate online."
