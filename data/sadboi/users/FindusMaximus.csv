Slycooper,fo6xb3y,t3_g4loln,1587568456.0,"Sly 3

Sucker Punch did a great job at developing Sly's character throughout the trilogy. In the first game he was still a little naive and arrogant, in the second game he was much more charismatic and experienced, but he was still really self-centeted. In the third game he learned that his friends and Carmelita was more important to him than his reputation as a Cooper family member and even though the gameplay suffered a bit from this, it  made him more likeable as a character. Also, his wit hit it's peak in the third game.

We don't have to talk about the 4th Sly. The misinterpretation of the characters is the most common complaint about TiT. Sly is just annoying and careless in this game"
