relationship_advice,fg2ou7f,t1_fg253l6,1580450252.0,"finally, someone who realizes what i realized!   i judged him for knocking her up the 2nd time even realizing that he didnt want to marry her.   and i also judged him cause i could EASILY 100% get pregnant with this guy if i wanted to.  its just kind of a turn off, u know??   

i was over his place last week and the mom came to pick up the kids while i was sleep and i over heard her voice down stairs and im just like... wtf??   and also she comes around his family during the holidays!   not to mention, in the beginning of the relationship when we started dating, she would find excuses to call him all the time and once she even tried to have him come help her when her car battery died!   i was like ummm, if u are gonna go help her, im leaving cause im not gonna sit here and wait for u to come back!  my time is valuable. 

theres just so much more to it.  over time the ex thing got better but TBH i expect this man to contribute himself to me a little more because i sacrifice so much due to his baggage. 

not to mention, we had split once for a period of time 6-8mo? and he dated 2 girls in those times.  and when i came back around (long story), his kids would accidentally call me by one of their names and also asked his dad in front of me if he had miss so and so... im not jealous, but im SO turned off by it and i judge him for not being serious with them and bringing them around the kids."
relationship_advice,fg2o6pq,t1_fg1ka2o,1580449639.0,"sorry, i didnt include the whole story to it, thats why.  im speaking of this man in particular.  not all single dads."
relationship_advice,fg23txj,t1_fg22oka,1580437524.0,"thanks for your wishes.  that def made me feel :)

this dad wanted me to ""simplify"" my life.  its like he was happy that i had stop taking care of myself to keep the things that made me feel beautiful and happy.  i resented a little because umm.  he met me when i was at my best.   i feel like whatever he couldnt contribute to, he would look down upon. 

i started not taking care of my appearances cause i was too busy for his kids.  no more time for spas, vacations, nails, hair, etc.  lol and when i mentioned it, it went in one ear and out the other. 

but like i said i do take part responsibility."
relationship_advice,fg22gv9,t1_fg20ro5,1580436893.0,i know i could be self centered but i also been told how selfless i am.  i am very generous and i love spoiling and sacrificing for those i love.  i thought i loved this guy until i realized i wasnt happy with myself in the relationship.  i had 12 nieces and nephews i took care of and do not expect a thing back.  their acknowledgement and love was simply enough.
relationship_advice,fg222g0,t1_fg20ro5,1580436715.0,"yeah i guess context can be misinterpreted in so many ways.  i do not want to disqualify single dads, honestly.  i have 3 brothers who are dads and i would feel terrible if someone felt they werent worthy of a relationship.  but i do have to say, some single dads have disadvantages. 

they'll just have to know the baggage and somehow figure out what works for them.  

ive met amazing single dads who treated me well.  and the fact that they were dads didnt even cross my mind. 

i think this dad in particular just made me feel less than what i deserved.  he was cheated on and his ex baby mama even looks down on him so something must be wrong?"
relationship_advice,fg205if,t1_fg1zr3x,1580435860.0,"i absolutely do not look down on single dads.  i would still date single dads if its worth it for me, meaning we'r both happy with circumstances.  to say i wouldnt date single dads is really tough.  cause ive met great ones."
relationship_advice,fg1zrcc,t1_fg1yqew,1580435687.0,what makes u say i keep tabs?  i keep my standards is what i do.  idk what your back story is.  but i sacrificed and wasnt happy.  simply put.  you must be a single dad ðŸ˜‚
relationship_advice,fg1za0z,t1_fg1nby4,1580435470.0,"thank you.  i dont think i wouldnt date single dads again, but i'll only date them if hes worth dating.  meaning, if im happy enough to sacrifice our date nights/freedom to travel/etc.  i liked his daddy qualities but i started feeling unhappy cause he seemed to be happy that i was starting to be ""lower maintained"" ...not getting my nails done anymore, not keeping up with myself and my hair because his kids were so busy and i contributed by cooking his kids dinners, buying them gifts, buying him gifts, and treating the kids when necessary.  not to mention i was generous enough to give each kid $100/ea for christmas and he didnt even end up buying them gifts so they acknowledged me."
relationship_advice,fg1ylkl,t1_fg1lav7,1580435175.0,thank u for your time with writing this post.  i think people dont realize what a big deal children are and how it will affect your life.  i can relate to your post because i love traveling and having my sense of freedom.  i want to be able to pick up my bags and go.  i also have a lifestyle i enjoy and i felt like i had to downgrade my lifestyle in order to mesh with this man's daddy life.
relationship_advice,fg1y55p,t1_fg1k729,1580434971.0,you'r right!  i think dating someone with 1 kid is good but 3 is a hand full.  i almost feel like i age faster and giving up my youth for this man.
relationship_advice,fg1xzt5,t1_fg1m8at,1580434909.0,karma?  its a preference ðŸ˜‚ and yes i sit on a tall horse cause im a woman of value and standards.  not sure if u read that i was looking for answers from people who can relate. not give an opinion.
relationship_advice,fg1xpkc,t1_fg1kqql,1580434790.0,"also, i sacrifice 3 days out of the week to give his 3 kids my attention.  not only do i have to watch what i do and say around them/be cautious but i also have to deal with baby mama drama on top of his own family."
relationship_advice,fg1x6rt,t1_fg1kqql,1580434552.0,self centered?  may be.  i was born the youngest out of 6 siblings who treated me well and i returned the favor with their kids.   so if a man doesnt have those qualities i dont need a relationship with them.    jealous?  not at all.   i have plenty to offer for someone who is worthy of my love and affection.   relationships are about give and take.  why would i tend to him and his 3 kids if im not equally getting in return?   its unfair.

at least in the end you know you'v given your best.   from a Real Female perspective, she probably just needs what money cannot buy.  all the luxurious things dont matter when it comes to love.   its attention, care, and details.  the little Physical things.  even if she doesnt give you that chance anymore (hopefully she does) im sure along the way she won't forget it if she's a genuine soul."
