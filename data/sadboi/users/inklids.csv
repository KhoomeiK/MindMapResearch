It's very tourist-heavy here, so the toilets must make a lot of money, but I feel that as a resident I should be able to go to the toilet without having to pay. Thankfully I'm quite small so I can duck the turnstiles easily!"

whatsthisplant,f7m16du,t3_dwwybf,1573852266.0,"I found this fern whilst doing a plant survey for a university assignment in Devon, UK. It was in a place where there were many exotic species so it may not be native, although it wasn't contained in any way. I thought it would be easy to ID due to the splitting branches of the pinnae - I've never seen anything like it! - but my searches have brought me no answers. Unfortunately I didn't get a picture of the plant as a whole but I did get the underside."

anxietysuccess,f5qlv73,t3_doudga,1572379185.0,"I do, and I commend everyone that does it despite their fear. I was very much forced into learning when I didn't want to and had a car lined up for me when I (somehow) passed as my family were very eager for me to be able to run them errands. I quit within 2 months and sold the car. I was on the verge of a panic attack every moment behind the wheel and I managed to hit someone's wing mirror in the lane next to me because I was panicking over how tight it was. I thought it best that I quit before someone got seriously hurt because of me, driving is no joke. 


I'm facing the fact that I may have to start it up again in order to get a job and it terrifies me. My family also ask me about it every time I see them because they are pretty disappointed but I always have the same answer, ""well, I have my license now so I'll start again when I'm ready."""

Anxiety,f0ony59,t1_f0om7m2,1568816137.0,"I once read a comment, I think it was either from this subreddit or the anxiety success one (I would recommend that one, it will give you even more hope!). It was very long but the one thing that stuck with me from it was ""You have to learn to be okay with being anxious."" 


My therapist made me do something they called ABC which helped with that. Every time I had an episode I would note down the date and rough time that it happened, then A- the adversity, which is the event that started the panic, which in our case could have been a chest pain. B was for belief of what caused the situation (incoming death, terrible illness...). And C was the consequence - how it made you feel and act. I had a little diary and I wrote down these things every time an event happened.


Over time I started to see the patterns in my thinking and soon every time the panic started I would be going through the ABC of it, ready to write it down. It really helped to immediately bring me back down to ground level and like I said, attune my mind to my mind rather than my body. 


Eventually, I learned to recognise the feeling of being anxious, in the background, and I told myself it was okay, that yes, the feeling was happening but nothing bad was actually happening. The anxiety no longer spiralled into panic attacks, so I could write it off - it's not so bad, it will pass! I was okay with being anxious. 


I hope my words will bring you some comfort. I don't know if this exact method will work for you but I know it's worth a shot. I'm rooting for you!"
Anxiety,f0ol6lk,t3_d5x5t4,1568814154.0,"I was in your situation, starting from around April. I was so finely attuned to everything in my body that any slight change would send me reeling and sure I was about to die. I convinced myself -- I didn't think, I KNEW -- I had everything from undiagnosed diabetes to a brain tumour and that everyone who tried to reassure me didn't want me to survive. I felt like I was constantly on the cusp of dying, if not today then in the next few weeks. This literally started happening to me overnight from a single incidence of a headache. I can really sympathise with your situation, and I want to reach out to you and tell you that as of right now I am OKAY. I am more than coping - I am no longer plagued by it and I truly believe you will get there too.


I was also prescribed propranolol, and for me, it did help, although it made me very sleepy all the time. Note that it took a good 2 weeks to actually start working. I started going to therapy and the two combined really helped me to slow down and analyse my pattern of thinking so that I could stop the intrusive thoughts from spiralling before a panic attack started. I am currently not on any medication apart from the occasional use of CBD oil which helps me sleep when times get rough. 


I stopped looking up symptoms obsessively, and I believe that is very important. Learn to accept that you are being illogical - that was a hard one for me as I am very stubborn, but I was presented with arguments from my friends, family and doctors that made total sense as to why I couldn't have X illness and I still wouldn't believe them. Stop drinking caffeine and alcohol or any other mind/body altering substances for now, they will affect your mind which is currently very finely attuned to your body! If you can make your mind finely attuned to your mind instead, you will begin to be able to pull yourself out of this. Your psychiatrist or therapist should be able to help you with that. 


I'm sorry for the long message but your story really resonated with me. Feel free to send me a message any time if you want to know more about how I learned to cope. I'm wishing you the best ðŸ˜Š."

neopets,ezkotwn,t3_d1cyoi,1567964009.0,"Welcome back! I was in your exact position about a month ago and you might be happy to know that I already reached that 1mil goal (nearly at 2 mil!) pretty much solely through food club, so it's definitely the way to go! 



I would also recommend downloading the Ghoul Catchers app as you can earn 50k neopoints per day by just repeating the first level. It goes a long way to help recoup the money spent on food club bets. If there's ever an iffy day where the odds aren't good, I just put 5000np on each bet (as you can have up to 10) and then I don't even worry about those np being lost!!



Another thing that I was surprised/caught out by coming back was a new daily, The Coincidence. This daily has made traditional ""junk"" items that I remember sometimes worth up to 10k neopoints!! So don't go donating all the junk items you find on your account straight away!


Its great to see other people returning, and I hope you enjoy your new neopets journey! Feel free to add me as a friend - my username is next to my Reddit name."
