It all sounds like a lot of throwing insults out of anger if you ask me, and as understandable as that it, it doesn't always have the best outcome, especially when you don't intend for what you say to have such a big impact.

Once you have decided what you want to do, talk to them and tell them exactly how you feel. Explain that you thought they were joking and that you wouldn't have said it otherwise, and explain that Catholicism is something important to you that you want them to respect. 

Everybody is entitled to their own opinions, but it doesn't mean that they should be pushed on others. You can decide to respect each other's differences, or move on (and apart).

I had my head over a bowl of boiling water and olbas oil one time (you know the method, with a towel over your head) because I had a cold and was congested. The table it was on was so rickety that it fell everywhere when knocked slightly, and the entire bowl was upturned on my lap.

 I ended up in hospital with third degree burns. All I really remember from the night is standing with the cold shower stream on my thigh and watching layer after layer of skin bubble up on my leg before dropping off and falling into the bottom of the bath.

I'm still surprised I don't have much of a scar, but it gets very sensitive to temperature change.

They will cling onto you out of fear of falling, and need to feel comfortable in order to relax their grip. The tail acts as a balance or support, so grabbing the tip of the tail acts as a stabiliser and makes them more likely to release.

awfuleverything,fq5y6s8,t1_fq4mfyz,1589120420.0,"I live in the uk, and as a child had a working (as in breed not practice) english cocker spaniel and she had a docked tail when we got her. However, her puppies didn't get their tails docked because the laws had changed at that point and we didn't have a gun license (proof that you will be working the dog and therefore can dock its tail). personally I don't like the idea of docking tails because it feels like a cruel thing to do, but I understand why it has to be done. When a dog is running through the undergrowth with a waggy tail, it can get caught on branches and even broken by the force of it getting hit. This can cause many problems, including infections, which would ultimately lead to an amputation later in life (plus lots of pain in the meantime). Most dogs get their tails docked at 2 days old, before they know what is going on and/ or will be able to remember. They get plenty of medication to help with the pain, and the procedure is as humane as possible. As for ear clipping, I am not sure on the laws in the UK, but would presume it is either illegal or that the same applies. The puppy in the picture looks way too old to have undergone the same procedure in the uk, but then I can't really comment because I don't know the situation."

lifeonmars,fp927gm,t3_g7cjoy,1588411467.0,"Bearing in mind that Shaz's death reveals that she was from the 'future' (by the uniform she was wearing, which looks fairly recent), and that she looked to be roughly the same age at her time of death as she did in Gene Hunt's World, it would suggest to me that she did not change age after her death. This would then imply that her parents from Gene Hunt's World would not recognise her as their own, and she would have no connection to her parents from the 'future' (being dead and all). The only way that this would work would be for her to have hallucinated the meeting with her parents, or that she visited them in 'ghost form' (purgatory is considered to be the reason for ghosts existing, and thus it would make sense for her to be a ghost and will herself into visiting her parents from the real world in this form, all the while believing it was real). However, the fact that her parents paid for her wedding dress would confuse this idea, considering that real life parents aren't likely to go around paying for wedding dresses for their ghost daughters. Therefore, I would presume that my former guess is more accurate, and she hallucinated/ willed into existence a set of parents which matched her real ones."

The eyes of the dude in the middle suggest to me that the tool is aiding in the user's 'second sight', i.e psychic vision as well as 'normal' vision. The rounded shape and shiny back would definitely back up this theory. The hexagram, which, along with the runes, symbolises the 'old' planets in our solar system, is often used in ceremonial practices to summon spirits and divine forces, which would definitely go hand in hand with scrying, as a lot of scrying practices rely on 'help' from them.  Chances are this is a ceremonial tool which would belong on its previous owner's altar and would be used as part of their rituals and daily practice. There is no evidence to suggest that this is ancient, most objects like this were popular in the sixties, following Crowley's popularity, and the wear and tear visible from the photos looks to me to fit this theory."

SewingStations,forhti8,t3_g8j7to,1588012475.0,"I made a basic pegboard to hang spools and bobbins, etc. on, using just what I had lying around. Get some chipboard or other similar board, paint it (or not, its your call),  and mark off each hook placement with a pencil (roughly 1inch X 1inch apart in straight rows/columns), and then bang a nail into each dot. Add two hooks or drill two holes at the top for some string, and hang. Takes up barely any space as it hangs vertically on the wall, and is easy to access. My favourite bit is that I can organise threads by colour so that it is easy to pick out what I need.  Bear in mind that it can get quite heavy once full, so make sure it is safely hung, or prop it up against the wall if not. 

You could also try empty (clean) sauce/ jam jars as storage for pins, buttons, and other haberdashery bits. Paint the lids and label for easy finding. Also, save any cardboard boxes, which you can paint or cover with patterned paper and use as storage. Slot in empty toilet roll tubes as dividers.

 I would recommend the kon mari folding technique for fabric storage, and use a clear plastic storage box with a lid. If you have loads of fabric, separate by colour or texture into several boxes. 

Pinterest is great for storage and organisation ideas, so I would definitely suggest having a look there if you are struggling.
