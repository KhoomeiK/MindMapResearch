You can’t guarantee every kid in a class is going to be able to play any given game. Not just because they may not own it/the pc or console needed- but because parents ARE NOT going to believe a video game has been set as homework. Some will have very outlier type beliefs about games. 

At least books LOOK like real school work. 

This has too much of a chance for opening kids up to bullying because they are too poor or their parents are too weird to let them play.

Numbering EVERY candidate for your electorate below the line on a Loooooong page, or 1-(?) where ? = the number of other parties fronting a candidate in your electorate. Labour ( close ish to democrats but kinda leaning a bit too right wing these days) Liberal ( republicans) Greens being the 3 majors, though Greens get to be more of a “conscience” for the other 2.

A butt load of minors/independents who throw their “preferences” ( meaning they will back the playbook of one of the major 3 parties and voting for them kinda means your vote goes where they want it to) 
Including such wonderful arseholes as “family first” lead by major conservative Christian nutjob Reverend Fred Nile if you want to look him up. Delightful POS.

So... it’s actually not hard for DIFFERENTLY ABLED people to vote. In the case of full blown dementia and coma/vegetative state or VERY severe brain damage, you are excused on compassionate grounds. Others are taken case by case, and degenerative diseases may eventually change capacity to vote on medical grounds, but damn straight people who are able to vote, disability or not.
