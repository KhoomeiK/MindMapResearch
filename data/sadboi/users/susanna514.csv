However most of them were pre coming out for me. I haven’t ever felt unhappy being female, but I have always felt a little disconnected from a majority of women. (Referring to cisgender women, no disrespect meant though). For example, I worked in a restaurant once where most of the other servers were kind of stereotypical bubbly blonde girly girls. Which is fine, nothing wrong with it. But I’ve never been able to connect with groups of women like that.  

I feel like I’m rambling but my point is, I’ve done a lot of self reflection on the idea of being transgender. And I truly don’t believe that I am, but yet I identify with some of the things on the list. I just hate that we are supposed to put a label on ourselves. Once in awhile I’ll fantasize about having a penis during sex, but I also love being a woman with a vagina. I like feeling feminine and pretty, but I hate dresses. And I hate that we’re often made to feel like we have to have a label or “pick something.”"

HauntingOfHillHouse,fc01zdb,t1_f973b31,1577274430.0,I’m actually shocked the angel wings weren’t intentional. I loved this moment so much. Mrs. Dudley looking out for Olivia at this moment was a wonderful spot of brightness in the show. If only Olivia had listened.
MaliciousCompliance,fbtolqg,t1_fbtm9fn,1577087685.0,"That’s lucky. I put in my two weeks notice at a big box store, and was working two jobs at the time. My other was a serving job so I liked to keep my Friday’s and Saturday’s open. Got scheduled at the big box store, which would have been a four hour shift working minimum wage. Decided to call in and head to the serving job, where I could have easily made 200 dollars. Big box manager told me since I put in my two weeks, don’t bother coming back. Not a huge loss, it’s not like I was making the big bucks there."

I work closely with my boss who tends to have a stern resting face and I’m constantly thinking I did something wrong or she’s upset with me. Of course this makes me more anxious, so it’s really a vicious cycle."
TwoXChromosomes,fbiv562,t1_fbhydil,1576915797.0,"I lived in a rental house once, and the landlord didn’t think to call and notify us about having work done on the backyard. So I opened the door in my pajamas to a bunch of workers in the backyard."
HumanForScale,fbi6344,t1_fbgt9sn,1576891839.0,I’m assuming there’s multiple entrances? I imagine the routes to illegal areas from the main entrances would be guarded or monitored.
HumanForScale,fbi5zb8,t3_eda3sk,1576891753.0,"Are they illegal because they’re deemed unsafe for the public or is it preservation? Also, is it true there’s homeless camps and meetups in the catacombs?"

MaliciousCompliance,fb5hckw,t1_faybn5g,1576527630.0,"You’re right, it isn’t the same thing. I was just trying to say if I’m ordering and I get asked if I have an allergy or a preference for gluten free, I’m going to say allergy. I wouldn’t sit there and explain how it’s not an allergy but an autoimmune reaction. But yes I agree, anaphylaxis is much more immediately threatening."
MaliciousCompliance,fay9ve0,t1_faximz2,1576397211.0,"They should, but unfortunately what we know best is pills and not diseases. I try to stress it but I’ve started just wiping all the keyboards with these medical grade peroxide wipes before I use them."

MaliciousCompliance,faxh5os,t1_fawj3zb,1576383830.0,"Except we aren’t. It doesn’t cause an immediate reaction but they are consequences for consuming gluten as a celiac. Since a lot of people don’t understand what it means that it’s autoimmune, it’s easier to say it’s an allergy and get taken seriously."
MaliciousCompliance,faxgc4e,t1_fawwphn,1576383493.0,And yet I can’t get my coworkers to take me seriously when I ask them to eat over a paper plate when they eat chips or crackers. I’m in a pharmacy so we all use the same computers. One woman had just been eating cheez its and brushed the crumbs off and told me it was good. I feel like I need to bring in educational pamphlets on what happens if I have gluten.
MaliciousCompliance,faxfum6,t1_fawnrtr,1576383292.0,"Places that coat their fries make me so sad. I know it’s not you, but I’ve been to a burger joint where everything that went in the fryer was gluten free, except for the fries. I wish more restaurants would just leave fries to be fries and naturally safe for me eat."
MaliciousCompliance,faxfjrk,t1_fauv8zh,1576383171.0,These are my favorite kind of restaurants.  I already risk a lot eating out as a celiac but when staff understand what gluten is how to avoid cross contamination it’s wonderful.
