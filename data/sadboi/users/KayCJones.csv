Don't let anyone force you to choose. 

Whenever one starts bashing the other, firmly tell them you understand their negative feelings toward one another but they're not yours. 

Explain to each that if they continue making you listen to why they hate the other, you're just gonna havta stop listening to them. Stick with this statement and follow through consistantly. This goes for any other family members who rag on either Mom or Dad. 

You just might find some ppl respect you for taking this stand, but, at the same time, be prepared that any or all of them may be too caught up in negativity to understand.

Tell em you are absolutely going to keep your head clean and positive, and they should please respect that and not vent in front of you.

NOBODY should force you to choose between two ppl you love."

Each of us have different trying circumstances, and most of them are hidden from other people's view. So it makes it look as though ""why me?"" because everyone's load is completely different by nature.

I suffer from anxiety and social anxiety, so I am by no means dismissive of how brutal is your ordeal. It does suck, and takes a lot of ongoing work on our thoughts that can eventually make a dent in the anxiety attacks. It's my perpetual war.

I feel ya all the way. I hope you learn ways to cope with it as best you can. It's a monster.

While I technically have ppl I consider friends, they're in different places in life and not looking to explore and enjoy it as I am. So for all intents and purposes in everyday life, I have no friends.
Being alone sucks and, to me, breeds enormous depression.
And I don't mean sometimes being alone. I'm talking about life alone. 
Note I said friends, not a significant other, which can certainly be nice, but without an S.O. it still can be nice if one has close friends.

2. That in all likelihood, she's installing you as a backup plan, an insurance policy if her new relationship goes south.

3. She doesn't know how to enjoy being independent, so she's stocking up the freezer for when munitions run dry.

4. Don't run into a new relationship until you've resolved your feelings about this, but at the same time do not hold back seeing other people if you're ready.

5. No matter how convincing (she will convince herself too), do not believe a word she says about this. She could be lying not only to you but to herself and not realize it.

6. If getting back together is in your future, the best chance for it to happen is to go your separate ways both emotionally, conversationally, and physical distance without hanging on to hope for the least probable of outcomes.

7. We all have our good traits and flaws, but selfishness is definitely one of hers. You might find you could do much better - but only if you TRULY let go.

circumstances

I wish you much clarity, success, safety from getting hurt and a future life with someone for whom you're number one. People do actually fall in love with those suffering with depression. I explain my condition to potential mates in a matter-of-fact way with no self-pity. That's all it takes.

My family was very accepting when I told them about my depression, so I'm happy about that. Some of them I could share my lack of activity AKA nothingness. Emptiness. Vacuum. Void.
