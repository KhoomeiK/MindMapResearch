relationships,fq4tefp,t3_ggu9h1,1589083751.0,"I think this is pretty normal for a lot of people right now. Personally, I would wait until after the pandemic to get a better sense of how I feel. Definitely don’t ignore how you’re feeling though. Imagine how things will be if you are married and living together and if you realistically see it working. I think a lot of relationships are being tested right now. Try doing little things like going for a walk alone or just limiting time together by being in different rooms of the house or something. It’s hard but I think it can be done."

relationship_advice,fq4qbhn,t3_ggtepq,1589081702.0,"Lying is one of the biggest issues that can occur in any relationship for sure. I know what you’re dealing with on some level — I’ve been there. I’m not saying he’s not telling the truth I’m telling you that he lies to protect your feelings (I think we’ve all done this at some point) but it should never be a regular thing or a habit. Being on the other side of it is STRESSFUL too. You constantly question everything they say and drive yourself crazy wondering. Nope my honest opinion, he needs to stop doing this alone and away from you and this relationship. It’s not impossible for him to stop while dating you but I feel it is unlikely. Especially when you have forgiven him and shown you will give him chance after chance. In my experience with that in general, once they see you forgive them for an action once, then twice, then three times, they never stop. 

I wish you the best."

For example, I'm currently focused on manifesting being with a specific person so I follow his rituals and meditations in regards to that. I have a manifestation journal I've recently been using. I write down gratitude for what I am manifesting as if I already have it, daily. I also do the 3x33 method where you write down your intention for 3 days, stop for 3 days, write for 3 days, and keep going until you get it. Now that's my work in progress.

As for manifesting little things sometimes all you have to do is speak it into existence and focus on the feeling of that thing happening. Visualize what you want to manifest as clear as possible. From what I've learned it's focusing on the feeling that is what is most important."
