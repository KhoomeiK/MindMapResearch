Christianity,fr5gx99,t3_gmqhsd,1589908380.0,"You have received quite a variety of answers here - some containing more sound doctrine than others, and while none of us has the answer for your dilemma, God certainly does.

I'm glad you are bringing this up now - early enough into the seriousness of the relationship - so you can step back and see this problem for what it really is. I believe somewhere deep in your soul you already know the answer but can't bring yourself to break up with a guy who professes to love you based on his terms.

The pressure you feel now is here to stay. His goal is not to love you unconditionally according to God's definition of love, but to get what he wants.

Since God created human beings designed for relationships - with Him and each other - He was careful to give us a manual on the ""do's and don'ts"" for our protection. He knows sin destroys and hurts people when they step outside of His plans for our time here on earth.

You say God comes first in your life and that is something you will need to stay accountable to. Sometimes it's hard for even Christians to deny their flesh, much less a nonbeliever who doesn't have a clue what that means. 

Priorities are what compel us to show God how we really feel about our relationship with Him. And I believe the best thing you can do is to break off this relationship and focus on serving God without this boyfriend in the picture. I would hate for you to experience the consequences down the road when you had the chance to escape the awful feelings that might come.

This is a hard topic to discuss in this small space, but I would very happy to continue it in a chat if you'd like. I promise to be praying for you."

There is rarely a comfortable or convenient way to take ownership of your family priorites without other family members feeling entitled to decide them for you. I loved the decisions we made as a married couple and as parents and have no regrets, but you can be sure that others in the family strongly disagreed. 

Since your in-laws have been around longer and experienced more, they probably feel as though their perception of things is the only accurate account. I hope they mean well when they bring these things up in conversation, instead of trying to hurt you to prove their point. 

I'm glad you are speaking with a counselor. But I'm not so sure the ""grin-it-and-bear-it"" approach is really a biblical approach to reconciling. Acting Christlike is more a matter of the heart than outward actions - it's  more between you and God rather than between you and them. 

The only encouragement I have to offer is to make sure you and your husband are in complete agreement on how to protect your marriage. That will be a higher priority, and inside that relationship will be where the boundaries can be set in place and reinforced.

It's time for you to step back and see the goodness in your heart and cling to the person you are. He can try to damage you but do not let him. You are defined by other things and not the lies he spews.

In answer to building a new start - look at yourself and make a fresh promise to protect and guard your heart. It's ok if he doesn't want to accept you for who you are. He is better off away from you following after his lusts and self-serving desires.

If both of you made a list of what you need and what the other spouse can do to meet those needs, perhaps you can come to an agreement to protect what matters the most. If each of you can both agree that sacrificing conveniences for the sake of the other person is a necessity, then you stand a good chance of strengthening and enhancing your relationship.

I would like to encourage you to seek out wise counsel for yourself while you are trying to figure out what to do next. Even the worst of situations can be turned around, but in the meantime, do something wondeful for yourself, and let someone help you navigate your way through this turmoil.

TrueChristian,fqe93nb,t3_ghpdu6,1589303749.0,"Gosh, I know so many Christians who have expressed the very same feelings about themselves.

After becoming a Christian, I would have never thought that a new believer could struggle so much accepting their new identity. It troubled me that people feel this way and I had to question God why. But after studying His word, and studying various Bible characters, I learned that it is a process to grow into the person God intended us to be.

Sometimes it means shedding our falso hopes (like I had to do), shedding our expectations, shedding our past thought life, and shedding ambitions that take the place of loving God with all our heart, mind, soul, and body. In exchange, we receive an inheritance of Christ-likeness that lets our lives glorify God. It took me years to fully realize this.

Remember the verse that says, ""He who began a good work will carry it on to completion""? I discovered that part of the ""carrying it on to completion"" includes learning to be content in all things. I think once you get to be my age, things don't matter much anymore, but relationships do. When I die, I will be sad to leave my family, not the things I have accumulated.

Lord, I pray for my friend here who was brave enough and vulnerable enough to openly share what troubles their heart the most. I ask you to show them the path they must take to know you better, and the riches that come from a personal relationship with you. Amen."

Watching my diet and eating only the freshest of foods - which for me means cutting out all sugar, alcohol, caffeine, processed and prepared foods, and junk foods.

Getting outside once or twice a day to go for a nice walk. It distracts my thoughts from the mundane and helps me appreciate this beautiful world we live in.

Listen to my favorite music, which for me is worship music. There are amazing music artists who seem to be able to capture in words the feelings I share about needing to trust God in times like this.

Spend time reading good materials that are uplifting and encouraging.

Write out my feelings on paper and reflect on what I can do to become a better person. I pay careful attention to where my greatest challenges are and pray about becoming a stronger person.

I tap in to my creative side and stay busy with hobbies the best I can. The process of creating is so rewarding.

On a much deeper level, if I am encountering a personal conflict in a relationship, and realize I will never have peace until it is resolved, I have to get to the root cause of it and decide what my character is made of and how badly I want to reconcile. 

If I start a craft project and my first three attempts fail, no big deal. The process was a learning experience. If I continue attempting the same craft project twenty more times and fail, I admit I'm not cut out for it and walk away.

The paranoia that prevents a person from moving forward is a trap, like an unwelcome and unwanted inferiority that defines them. The good news is that a person does not have to stay paralyzed by fear.

Make a list of things you enjoy, or wish you could enjoy more often, and set some short term goals to achieve them.

One thing I did when choosing curriculum was to have an idea of which school I might send my child to in the event I was not able to continue teaching. I checked what their goals and objectives were for each of the four quarters and kept that in mind when pacing out the subjects and activities over the year.

As it turned out, I stopped homeschooling at 7th grade, and my three children were right on target where they needed to be once entering the classroom setting and passed the state achievement tests with flying colors.

Every child is different and what works for one may not be the best choice for another. Maybe you can look on some Pinterest pages and see all the activites a kindergartner will be faced with and decide which ones you think your child will gravitate to.

Each person is different, so my advice is to carefully sift through all the info on the internet, and stick to facts about food. It's really basic logic. 

Low carbs is easy - read labels and select veggies that are low carb. Check out the website called ""World's Healthiest Foods"".

Watch out for fruits though - yes, they are very nutrient desnse and obviously good for you, but their high carb content must be factored in to your overall carb intake for the day. 

Same with grains - they are inticing and filling, but will dump excessive amounts of sugar into your blood, and that sugar turns to fat and gets stored in insulin. Not good for good health.

Meats - grass fed only, hormone free only, antibiotic free only

Fish - many fish are high in mercury so do your research beforehand

Fats - organic unrefined coconut oil, organic olive oil, and avocado oil only. All the other fats and oils are garabge foods.

Stick to eating mostly veggies, and let 80% of your diet be from raw and cooked veggies."

I fought it for most of my life and it wasn't until about 5-6 years ago that I became aware of all the things that I could do to alleviate the intensity of it. Now, my depression is gone. 

Finding out the root cause of the depression will be key, because that will determine the course of action to take. For example, is the depression from damaged genes prior to when you were born (hereditory)? From PTSD? From a death or grief? From a broken past? From poor diet or lifestyle? I discovered the reasons for my depression included many of those I just mentioned, including the poor diet. 

When a person feels they have lost their sense of control over their lives, there are simple things they can do to regain that control back. You may not believe this, but what I am going to say is so true - understanding how food affects the nervous system, the adrenal glands, the pituitary gland, the amygdala, and the hypothalumus will show you how eliminating many foods can significantly reduce or reverse many cases of depression.

Exercise is huge! The more the better!

Seeking wise counsel from the right person is KEY! Not all counselors are the same!

The other important factor to keep in mind is that you will be having numerous conversations about your [childrens sexuality](https://bit.ly/2yPXJT2) in the coming years, and the topic won't always be about babies, but rather how they view the gift of their bodies and how God intended to use them."

Where does he stand as far as his discernemt about what is considered a good husband? Ephesians 5 calls all husbands to love their wives as Christ loves the church. Have him make a  list of 15-20 things that Jesus does that shows his love for us, his church.

He knows what you are battling, and your faith is precious to Him, so you can be sure He doesn't want to lose you.

It's so easy to believe you will never have what it takes to become a man of God, because afterall, it's the biggest lie that the devil hurls at people - their worthlessness and their inability to ever please God.

Here's the thing - living in the world satisfies the cravings of the sinful nature, We are self-indulgent people and some spend a lifetime trying to secure what feels good, even when it costs them. We are really only passing through this life. Someday it will all burn up. So why not set your mind on where you will spend eternity. God made you for Himself, so it stands to reason that he has you here for a reason, all the while knowing exactly what temptations you face.

Hope is not lost friend. You are no different than anyone else in need of grace to get through this life. The difference comes from the choices we make. And one last thing - your post does make sense - a lot of sense. You are not alone, and you don't have to feel you have what it takes to be this perfect Christian.

The secret is in spending time with Him to get to know Him, just like you would with anyone else you desire to share a deep intimate personal relationship with.

My husband and I actually had a conversation on the topic of miracles not too long ago and the trillions of miracles God still does in people's lives all over the globe. God doesn't walk through the streets performing miracles like He did during His day for communities to see, but there are testimonies from individuals, hospital patients, doctors, co-workers, church friends, family, victims of war and famine, poverty, missionaries, pastors, christian organizations, churches, children, people from all cultures, and many other sources who have experienced miracles.

Yes, God still heals, leads, restores, equips, forgives, rebuilds, nurtures, speaks, loves, guides, and provides the security we need to continue on our journey through this lifetime. God is still alive and active.

I believe that is what God is doing for you too - stirring your conscience and alerting you to initiate a closer relationship with Him.

I became a Christian but my boyfriend did not. Even so, I refused to have sex with him any longer. Then he became a Christian and we got married.

I think it is wonderful that you are detecting God's leading in this, and that you have the sensivity in your spirit to respond the way you are. God is speaking to you sweetheart.

The best thing you can do is seek out some Christain counseling, preferably with a pastor from a bible believing church, or a woman in the church who is in a position of biblical authority. You'll feel so much better unloading this deep guilt and conflict. God knows your heart and wants to help you. The longer you put it off, the harder it will be.

I think much of God's plans for our lives are already written in the Bible. The secret is to know what the Bible says.

We as humans tend to equate ""plans"" with having a family, career or profession, being a parent, living out our dream to become a doctor, missionary, or minister, a singer, a musician, etc. Yes, God can and does lead us to make those decisions and nurture us in the process of becoming the best we can be, but I believe His ultimate plan is to make us like Him, 

I know that can sound contrite and incomplete, but it's true. The Gospels are full of commands from Jesus and the writers of the letters to the churches couldn't possibly be any more clear of how we are to behave as Christians. 

Try looking up the word ""will"" in a concordance and get the scriptural references that include that word, or look up ""God's will for our lives"" in a search online and study exactly what it is that God wants us to become. It really truly is to become more like Him."

The good news is that during those years, I learned more about God than I ever would have expected. Mental challenges in a Christian's life can have a spiritual connection to them, but I believe they also have a physical connection because of what is happening in the brain and the messages it gives out and receives. The mind, body, soul, and spirit were all designed to work in unison, and when one is hurting, they all hurt.

Once a person truly understands how the brain functions, and how living in a sinful world impacts it, it becomes easier to understand the grace of God and how far it reaches. God loves us no matter what, and we have a Father who knows us better than we know ourselves. He knows what brought us to where we are now, and all the conflicts that got in the way.

What isn't supposed to happen is for one parent to control the other and demand their way is the only way. This is not Biblical, nor does it produce [healthy results](https://bit.ly/34yoGqd).

I don't think there is a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to getting close to God and that's the beauty of our own personal relationship with Him - He meets us right where we are and allows us to be as honest and vulnerable as we need to be. Only He can carry the weight of how we really feel and why.

In response to your question if you are deserving of God's grace because of the guilt you continue to carry, I would like to share my thoughts on that -

We are all the same in God's eyes, He has no favoritism based on what we do or don't do.

He died for all.

His grace covers all our sin. Not one of us deserve His grace. All of us cannot survive without His grace.

We cannot earn His favor, nor can we change His plan to love us unconditionally.

We cannot let the devil rob us of these truths.

The panic you experience could be stemming from the fear that you do not measure up to God's expectations of you. We will never be able thwart God's love away from us. There is nothing you or anyone can do to make us more eligible for God's grace. It is ok to acknowledge our weaknesses and incapabilities. It's actually very Biblical to do that, in fact, those thought patterns line up with how David felt when he wrote the Psalms.

To get closer to God, you do it the same way you would with any other friend you wanted to cultivate a deeper more meaningful relationmship with. You spend time together. Sometimes you do the talking, and at other times, God does the talking. He speaks through His word, and into our spirits.

""Lord, I pray for my friend who wasn't afraid to expose their deep desire to know you more and to feel the closeness of your presence. I ask you now to draw them with your loving kindness and bring them into a place where there is no mistaking that you died for us to set us free, even our own doubts. I pray you will bring a calm to the panic attacks and replace them with a peace that passes all understanding, In Chrit's name I pray, amen."""

So many wonderful beautiful things are happening during this pandemic that may not have happened otherwise; people are talking to each other more, praying more, getting more exercise, more fresh air, focusing more on how fragile life is.

Who are your closest contacts? Grabbing hold of a lifeline in moments like this is critical. and who better than the body of Christ, wherever they are.

Pastors all over the world are airing podcasts, so there is never a shortage of hearing a good sermon.

We can pray together whenever you'd like - feel free to start a chat here. In the meantime, decide in your heart that you will take one day at a time and give it to the Lord as best as you know how. Talk to Him constantly. Begin writing in a journal. Call your friends more often than you normally do. Start group texts, or watch parties on Facebook to watch a worship service together. 

Ask God to help you redeem this time by showing you things you can be doing that will confirm His love for you. And I will be praying for you."
Marriage,fmbb9uh,t3_fu8o8n,1585922797.0,"I can see why you are writing a post like this - it would bother me very deeply too. When you stop to consider that trust is at the core of every healthy relationship, and realize your relationship is missing that one essential ingredient, it's enough to push you over the edge.

Of course your husband does not want to be declared ""guilty as charged"", and will do everything in his power to defend himself, maybe even to the point of blaming  you for any distance that creeps up between you. It might be too hard for him to face himself, or accept the damage he inflicted. Men would much rather say, ""it's in the past, so leave it there"", more as an attempt to shut you up and not be held accountable anymore.

The Bible tells us that ""out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks"". What that means is that you can detect what he is really feeling by the words he uses, his tone of voice, his insistence to protect you emotionally (or lack of insistence), and where your marriage security stands on his list of life's priorities.

Communication is the only way you can dig into these fragile topics, and that too will reveal where his heart is. Perhaps you might need to consider a third party, like a pastor of a Bible believing church, who knows how to counsel couples and get them on track. 

I don't know if any of this helps, but thanks for letting me share my thoughts, and I promise to be praying for you."
AskParents,fmb4xfi,t3_ftvbcp,1585918427.0,"Calculating how to stay in good standing with your peers is the only thing that matters to kids this age. There is nothing else that comes close to the importance of this for them. To take their phone away is like a death to them.

The excessive phone time has activated the [part of their brain](https://www.upworthy.com/this-mother-s-description-of-her-tween-son-s-brain-is-a-must-read-for-all-parents) that controls addiction. Most of the kids are hooked and have no means to reverse this addiction.

I feel for your mom. I raised my kids in a generation when we did not have cell phones.

I admire your attempts to help your sister. Since you are closer in age, she may listen to what you have to say, as long as she senses you are on her side. And by that I mean, once she detects you understand her obsession with her friends, she may open up about why it's so important, and then you can help her with those issues. This is really all about her self-image, and her self-worth.

Kids always say, ""..... you don't understand!"" But the truth is, we do understand.

Maybe you could go in her room and share a meaningful song that has lyrics she relates to.

Or find meaningful quotes that expose what she might be feeling on the inside, and then leave them on her pillow.

TrueChristian,fm8bmnj,t3_fth0il,1585846421.0,"What a beautiful post, and it is straight from your heart. God sees your intentions, and knows all about your efforts to know Him better.

The beauty about knowing God, is that He calls us His children so we can talk to him as a friend; God talked to Moses as a friend (Exodus 33:11) and called Abraham His friend (Isaiah 41:8 and James 22:3).

When you go to God, know you are going to a friend, except this friend knows your thoughts from afar, and knows your words before you even speak them. How wonderful and comforting that God knows us so well!

Start slow and give yourself very reachable goals. Here are some ideas to do that;

At some point during the day, whenever you feel the most free from the day's demands, sit with God for 5-10 minutes and go over the day, Practice talking to Him as though you were writing in your diary.

Write out one scripture verse you like, maybe something that pertains to your life right now, or your thanks to God for how much He has done for you, Carry the verse with you in your purse and pull it out occasionally during the day.

Start reading the Gospel of John and read one chapter per day. Read it very slowly, and ponder why each word is written. Sometimes I stay on just one sentence because it gives me so much to think about.

Lord, I pray for my friend who is reaching out you and needs to know how to get closer to you. I ask you to orchestrate their days in such a way, that the day cannot end until they have met with you. I pray you will encourage them and lead them to a deeper awareness of who you are. Amen"
diet,fm5jids,t1_fm5fqfx,1585774115.0,"To put it into very simple terms, what happens is when someone eats any kind of sugar, the pancreas releases insulin to gobble up all the sugar so you don't die because of too much being in your bloodstream. 

When sugar keeps coming in to your bloodstream from eating too many carbs and your body just cannot use up all that glucose for energy, the insulin reserve gets bigger and bigger and turns those sugars into fat. This puts unbearable stress on the pancreas, causing pancreatic cancer to be one of the leading cancers.

Diet changes health."

There are many moms who feel just like you do and are probably asking the same question. Have you contacted any of them from the school? If anything, just for support and encouragement?

Try asking your school district for their recommendations, especially if you foresee getting them back into the school system eventually. You will want your kids to be right on track for when they re-enter, if that's what you decide to do,

Christianity,fm1ufej,t3_fsegvu,1585685201.0,"This is a topic that has come to the forefront of my thinking these past couple of years, and I always tell myself that the older I get, the more God shows me, and the more I must focus on Him and not what I feel or what I experience.  I have been reading the Bible for 38 years, and during each season of my life, I thought I knew God the way He wanted me to know Him.

But each year, He reveals more fully what His plans are for my life, (exactly as they are outlined in the Bible), and it is up to me to accept them or not. In simplest terms, to follow Jesus means just that. To follow in His footsteps and live a life that duplicates His as much as humanly possible.

The Bible says, ""Lean not on thy own understanding, but in all ways acknowledge Him..."" *Proverbs 3:5-6.* That is a difficult challenge but one that sharpens our faith in ways we once deemed impossible to do. [Dying to self](https://www.openbible.info/topics/dying_to_self) does not come naturally to us, it can only happen through the power of Holy Spirit. This is a tough subject to discuss.

I have been where you are, where circumstances spun out of control and I needed emotional help, mental help, and a doctor's help. God used all three to restore my soul.

If you are feeling weak and depressed, please lean on others who will hold you up and support you in your weakest and darkest moments. Don't be afraid to admit you need emotional, mental, and physical help. The depression is a hormonal issue, and when one area of your life is hurting, all the rest hurt too. I should know - it happened to me.

Please ask God to take you beyond this place of uncertainty and relentless efforts to try to understand His will for your life. Ask people to pray for you. Call your pastor or other authority in your church to just listen to what you have to say. I hope some of this helps."
Christianmarriage,flxveut,t3_fqb35x,1585590565.0,"Such a popular question women ask!

I think, as in any topic in the Bible, it must be looked at within the context it was written.  This section of Ephesians is talking about the results from being filled with the Holy Spirit.

If you look at the word ""submit"" in the concordance, you will see a variety of Greek interpretations from Ephesians 5:21-22 that give us insight as to what the author was expressing. Verse 5:21 says we are to submit to one another in the fear of the Lord. It is the same Greek word used in Ephesians 5:22.

In this particular context, the word ""submit"" has the same meaning as James 4:7 that says submit yourselves to God.

This verse, Ephesians 5:22, is about our relation to God; it symbolizes the church's relation to God. It is a type of unity. Christ asks us to freely give ourselves to him because of his self-sacrifice he gave to us to us, which is the role model husband's must have towards relating to their wives as well.

It is a mirror image of how we should relate to each other.

Since Christ says in Galatians 3:28, there is neither male nor female, this verse is all inclusive of the husband's relation to the Lord also. We are all spiritually equal in the Lord's eyes.

This is what I have able to get from that verse being a wife now for 38 years, but to be honest, I think hearing an interpretation from a pastor who is more theologically trained would be a good idea.

In the meantime, [this](https://bit.ly/2w0BzN5) will be helpful."

Your dad has been deceived and doesn't know it. He is comforted by his beliefs even though they are not Biblical.
