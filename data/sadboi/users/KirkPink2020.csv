The biggest thing I can recommend for you is this. Make a time frame. Say 6 months. Put online dating away.Take 2 or 3 times a week to improve at a skill that'll help you build confidence.  Do that. It can be anything. Cooking. Art. Wood work. 
I obviously can't comment on your physical traits, but try and get an honest opinion from someone your close enough to. Listen to what they say. Then after 6 months, you have a stronger skill set that makes you more attractive, try and feature that in your dating profiles. Online dating is 75 percent being able to hook people in on the photos, follow up with some decent conversation. Don't try and be overly witty but be engaging. Go for coffee."
