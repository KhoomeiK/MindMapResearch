Car stayed like that all day, around 9:30pm some dick comes to my door asking if I did it which I didn‚Äôt hesitate to tell him I did. I figured he‚Äôd either have to come talk to me or spend an hour getting his car down. I was happy to help get his car down...      guess what. He never parked in my spot again.  Oh.
