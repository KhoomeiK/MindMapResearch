It comes with a little steel wool pad for using concentrate but I use it to just take up space in the chamber so I can use less. You get less dense vapor that way, but it doesn't impact how high you'll get. I highly recommend getting one, check out the Obsidian by magma industries once you get the volcano.  It's a little water bubbler for the Volcano that makes the already smooth vapor even smoother."
