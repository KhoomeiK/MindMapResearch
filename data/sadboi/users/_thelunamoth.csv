Longmont,fbxjdzh,t3_eex1k3,1577190330.0,"Your friend probably already knows but they should start by going through Coordinated Entry. OUR Center can help with that. This will get them into a shelter.

https://www.bouldercounty.org/homeless/


I would encourage them to register with Mental Health Partners. They have a lot of resources for people experiencing homelessness and addiction. They can walk into 834 S. Sherman in Longmont to get started. 

Your friend is very lucky to have you! 

If you have any specific questions, please reach out to me!"

almosthomeless,eubtdm5,t3_cfgpki,1563656547.0,"In Colorado after the eligibility meeting, that is usually it as far as processing. Then it‚Äôs time to either start looking for an apartment or waiting for an opening depending on your voucher. I agree, sounds like a formality bc it also mentioned being contacted when there was an opening. Sorry I couldn‚Äôt be more help! Either way, seems like you‚Äôre on your way! Exciting!"

mentalhealth,ett1isd,t3_cda47e,1563161625.0,I really hope you will consider speaking with a professional. It sounds like depression to me - I‚Äôve felt that way multiple times throughout my life. I‚Äôve been on medication since I was in 2nd grade. Most of the time it helps but there are still times when I feel nothing. I wish you the best and I‚Äôm rooting for you! I will be happy to help you set something up - pm me if you want. There are resources!
