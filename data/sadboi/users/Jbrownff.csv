During the worst of it, you get to the point that you dread going to bed because you know it's going to be a battle.  Night after night of no sleep turned me into a hallucinating zombie.  I tried Tylenol PM and Unisom.  It's really weird to feel that stuff trying to work only to feel your anxiety beat it back and win.  Finally after I reached my wits end, my doctor prescribed Trazadone.  It worked some of the time, which was an improvement.  After a while, I learned how much to take and when to take it.  Long story short, Trazadone really helped.  Also, once you accept the idea that you may not sleep, the sleep monster loses some of its power.  Your anxiety is nothing more that a demon that feeds on your fears.  It attacks everything both physically and mentally.  It wants to rule you and make you miserable at the same time.  Don't give it the satisfaction of feeling hopeless.  When you lay down tonight, let it know that its days are numbered.  It will win sometimes, but as long as you make it a fight, you will eventually win the war.  Good Luck!!!!!"

Bad news is, this could take a while.  Your symptoms will hit hard at first and every little thing will convince you that you have heart issues or cancer.  As time goes on, you will learn to ignore a lot of symptoms and check them off as harmless.  Then your brain will say ""oh yeah? try this on for size.""  and you won't sleep for a week and your chest will feel like a pregnant electric eel has burrowed behind your sternum.

Anxiety,epn65m4,t3_bl4fe4,1559322107.0,"Thanks for reaching out.  A few months ago my wife suffered a seizure at around 3 in the morning.  We were in bed asleep when I was woke by her convulsing.  I tried to wake her up but she was completely unresponsive.  I noticed she wasn't breathing, so I rolled her on her side.  Not sure why.. Anyway, after what seemed like a eternity, she finally started breathing again.  She still wasn't responding to my yelling and shaking her so I called 911.  In the time it took for the ambulance to get there, she had woke up and was talking to me.  She didn't know what year it was, or who the president was for an hour or so.  We went to the ER to get her checked out.  After all the tests, it was determined that her sleep apnea had caused her to stop breathing in her sleep which resulted in a seizure.  Thank God for the seizure or I may not have woke up to find her not breathing.  Now she's on a sleep machine and things are better.  Thinking that you just lost your wife will put you in a bad place.

A couple of weeks later, I was sitting in my recliner watching Netflix and out of nowhere, I felt like I was going to die.  My legs started shaking, I thought I was going to throw up, I would be freezing cold and pouring sweat at the same time.  For a week I couldn't sleep.  My head felt like it was going to burst.  I would get pins and needles all the time, everywhere.  Couldn't eat.  After a week, I was sure I was dying.  Stage 4 something or liver shutdown I was sure.  So we went to the ER.  And yes, you guessed it.. Everything was fine.  

Long story short, my brain is not anxious.  My body is a carnival of chaos.  My shrink put me on some Trazadone to help me sleep.  Also tried Trintellix for my head.  I was convinced that the Traz was making me a zombie and that the Trintellix was slowly killing me.  After a month of therapy and a few different med combos, I think im on the road to recovery.  I'm sleeping better, most nights.  And now i'm 3 weeks into Buspar.  I liked the idea that it wasn't habit forming.  I't seems to be helping I think.  Most of my symptoms are easing off.  Constant chest pain is now a occasional palpitation.  Headaches are few and far between.  My spasms are now occasional ""jumps"" in my arms and legs.  And now I can go through a entire day without worrying about dying.

Anxiety is a high maintenance bitch.   I feel like I may have had it most of my life, but the episode with my wife set things into full motion.  I force myself to deal with that scary night with my wife when nobody is around.  After a few minutes of reliving it in my head, I usually break down into a sobbing wreck.  Makes me feel better. 

Anyway, hope this was what you may had been looking for.  Hope it helps you or somebody."
