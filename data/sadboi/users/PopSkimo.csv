About Divination, if I'm understanding it well enough. Each different seal will boost self and party damage by 4, 5, or 6%. Does this stack with the regular cards or Lord/Lady? So you're boosting everyone by lets say 6% with Divination, then you also toss Lord/Lady for their 8% to stack for 14%?

I'm not sure how this new loop/rotation works"
ffxiv,fnycgkx,t3_g45xde,1587359090.0,"AST Question!

So, I took a long break after Heavensward came out and only recently came back and I have to ask. What exactly happened to Astrologian? AST was so exciting when I played it way back. I remember all sorts of cards that increased attack speed, damage resistance, damage dealt, recasts, mp costs and other cards to modify their effects to be even stronger and their respective durations were overall fairly lengthy.

Now I've come back to it and all cards are seemingly a flat, small damage increase and duration that feels halved. And speaking of the cards, why bother have 3 for melee DPS/ tank and 3 for ranged DPS/ healer? At that point, just make it two cards. I see they have seals but I'm unsure what exactly they do? Why even add bonus ones when they're literally the same effect as the other ones within their player boost category?

I even see Lady and Lord of crowns that increase damage by a whopping 1-2% overall and the duration doesn't even increase past the base 15 seconds from the weaker cards and its still a lower overall duration than what I remember anyways?

I loved Astrologian because it was more than just a straight healer. It offered a lot of different options and the feeling of drawing just the right card combo felt amazing. Now, after looking at its heals vs WHM and SCH, it just seems like a worse overall healer that's delegated to a damage buff of, at worst, 3% or at best, 8%? Can someone tell me I'm missing some sort of tech and nuance and that it's not nearly as gutted and weak as I'm seeing it to be? Maybe I'm getting hung up on the wrong thing but it feels like it lost a lot of diversity and options since everything is just damage focused now?"
