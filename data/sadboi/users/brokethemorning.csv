employedbykohls,fqapunz,t3_ghr8df,1589223212.0,"Putting in my $0.02 here, and keep in mind that I haven't worked for Kohl's since December 2017. I'm not eligible for UE in my state (IN) because I moved back to my hometown in early February and have had my current job (childcare through my local school district) only since late February. I'm very lucky that my current job is paying me through the end of May. After that is currently up in the air with restrictions and whatnot.

I get u/ohgodwhatthe's point. Yes, it's absolutely terrible that Kohl's pays shit wages and that UE benefits with the additional $600 is better than working in-person, but it's absolutely better than not having any source of income due to not going back and then losing out on UE benefits. I don't know about y'all, but if I was in OP's position, I'd ensure that I have an income to live on, even if it means going back to a job that is a lot of work for shit pay. In a country with an increasing unemployment rate, having a job at this point is something I'm immensely grateful for, and I'd imagine OP feels the same way, even if they're getting underpaid for what they're doing.

Job openings aren't exactly as prominent as some of you think they are. I tried looking for jobs myself in case our summer camp is canceled for the summer, but there's not a lot to choose from that I can work with. You also have to keep in mind that it's not always easy to just quit a job, especially in such an uncertain time."

AskReddit,fpzlyuo,t3_gg63my,1589020070.0,"(TW: abuse, suicidal thoughts)

I have a couple that Iâ€™ve been through in my life.

My first one occurred in December 2017. My mental health, specifically my anxiety, got so bad that I had to leave my retail job suddenly. My suicidal thoughts increased then, I developed a terrible sleep schedule, and I lost all motivation after my finals week was done. I luckily ended up finding an awesome steady job working with elementary-school kiddos before and after school, and my anxiety lessened.

My second one actually happened about three months ago. My long-term relationship ended after my ex verbally abused me while my anxiety was in full-action. It was an accumulation of stuff happening, but what happened the night we broke up was the straw that broke the camelâ€™s back. It affected me so much that for the first time in my life, I came inches away from attempting suicide. I moved back home the next day, and I barely slept and ate for several days after the breakup. I also fell into a severely-depressed state for about 2-3 weeks after the breakup. I managed to push through it somehow, and I was able to start back at the aforementioned job and work there for two weeks before we had to close due to the current pandemic (I still have my job luckily and am still getting paid). Iâ€™m healed, I have less anxiety and suicidal thoughts than I did three months ago, and Iâ€™m currently the happiest Iâ€™ve ever been."

* Gold Striker is hands-down the most disappointing coaster Iâ€™ve ever ridden. Itâ€™s my least-favorite GCI and possibly even my least favorite woodie.
