Only when we address it she says not us but the pressure is there. I am scared to do anything socially in a sense. I can't ask out girls I like without having thoughts like "" Will she think I'm creepy? What if I asked my friend out? Is being nice to my friend considered being a simp?"" And my favorite with my mom is ""depression isn't real, y'all need to man up"". Before this quarantine I was seriously thinking about ending my life but 2 things prevented me from doing so. First, ol religious belief of suicide=hell, second: my family and I are between low income and middle income bracket and studying engineering I want to be able to make a crap ton of money in the future, pay off whatever needs paying off, ensure my family lives comfortably to pay off my guilt that I was a leech to them because as a man if I haven't suffered like others, then I have no right to complain. 

Bottom line is: I have serious issues and I can't get the help I need because of who I am. I can't go to my traditional Caribbean parents because only ""white"" people get depressed (pls no backlash) and I have to live with this everyday that for now and for a while I can never have someone to trust and open up to because I am a male and I'm not supposed to show feelings and even to my female friends that say they support me, most just don't care.
