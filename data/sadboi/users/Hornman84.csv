Just my two cents..."
TriumphBonneville,fon8py4,t1_fon62ud,1587914638.0,"I personally would prefer a used, light Honda CB 500 F, or something similar to begin with. I began with the cheapest Kawasaki ER-5 I could find. I just wanted something that wouldn't make me cringe too much if I let it fall.  
Otherwise, if you don't fear falling over, the T100 or T120 are so easy to drive, it's a pure joy, and the bike really helps you keeping control in almost every situation. It's a really gentle british girl. The T100 might feel a little more nible, but I feel like the T120 is more than nible enough for my driving style. It's a calm and very forgiving bike for relaxed rides.  
For your questions... I never felt like I couldn't handle the weight. I actually passed my driving exam on one of these, because my Kawa broke down a week before.  
And I don't think it doesn't have enough horsepower. What I am after is torque. This baby has it's 105Nm of peak torque at 3.000revs. That's insanely low for a bike. Most other bikes have peak torque at 7-8.000revs. I love this low rev torque. It's more than enough power for me. This thing is fast. I love the T120.  
If you want something more nimble, you should consider the SpeedTwin. If you want more Power, you should consider the Thruxton. If you want the combination of both, the the StreetTwin. Otherwise maybe a StreetTriple?That's ultimately for you to decide."

Yes, I live in Switzerland. I can't complain about my treatment. In fact, it's excellent. I have a very good neurologist who is specialized in diseases of this kind, who diagnosed me. And I also got treatment for my ""black cloud"".  


I know the winters in Germany. I lived there for more than 20 years. Switzerland has very different winters. They might be colder, but still they do not feel that ""cold"" if you know what I mean.  
I have planned to excercise, of course. But the psychiatrists (Yes, a whole bunch of them take care of me - and they are all very nice!) are holding me up for now, because I am supposed to do one step after the other. But this will be my goal.  


Even though my treatment couldn't be much better, the financial situation actually is a problem. Since I probably had Parkinson's for a long, long time (I am talking about 20 years, or even from birth), I always struggled to get a decent job. All my life I could barely live from what I get. Since I payed into a social security system, I get something while being unable to work, but it's just 80% from what I could barely live, at best.
