TripSit,fqn3xnc,t3_gjfz7c,1589488255.0,"if i go to someone's house and they're cleaning behind the dresser or bed, i gotta wonder what crime they're trying to get away with ...  cleaning is a good contract because you don't need to go overboard with it, yet any work done towards it at all makes you feel pretty good ... you might feel as if it's a specific thing to you, and that the anxiety is a part of you, but the feeling you're experiencing is not idea specific, and you don't have a gloriously deep-rooted shame to work out ... if you're looking for things to improve, keeping things more in order can always be a good suggestion ... being able to think of things to improve is good for improving, not a malady ... as for what you do have, it sounds like you had an idea in the form of a question ... do you feel comfortable with your standards of cleaning, and if you do, do others?  these are openended question of no great importance, but when you're tripping the idea of uncertainty can startle the mind, and from there comes the nervousness ... and the nervousness makes you think it's real, but really it is you who lends it your attention ...   
so, take it away ... we can drum up questions and judgments about ourselves all day long, and we will always be adept at it because who knows us better than us ... because of this, if you wanna dwell in ideas, you have to take them with a grain of salt ... i can, if so inclined, rip myself and everything about me to shreds with the judgment mind ... all that judgment though and all that worry does not alter the physical world in any way, shape, or form though ... you do ... there's always a hesitation and a struggle from the mind when you consider a positive change in your life, and one of the greatest arguments against growth is ""THIS THING IS A PART OF YOU YOU CAN'T GET RID OF IT"" ... but you definitely weren't born with a deep-rooted cleanliness shame ... 

another good argument is ""THIS WILL BE SO MUCH WORK"" ... not really though ... it never is as much work as it seems when you think about it, because as much as we want to invest ourselves in the validity of our thoughts, our brains are helpful like a dog is helpful ... you may throw a stick and your dog will bring back a squirrel ... you may think about cleanliness and your mind may not have an answer and present it as some ultimate dilemma ... i promise you it isn't ... if you wanna change, there is subconsciously the thought (another goofy brain argument) that making a change will come with some grievous admission that all the time in the past was a mistake, poorly lived, etc ... i used to drink and be well known for partying and wild nights, and struggled with what people might make of my decision to scale it out of my life ... to date, no one has asked me why i stopped, and all the major turmoil was played out in my head for no real reason other than me clinging to the thought ... we want to prepare ourselves for the future, and when one seems uncertain, we tremble because we cannot decide ... when you're on any psychedelic, your perceptions are heightened, so the tremble and the perceived anxiety seem more intense ... it isn't a part of you though, it is just something you are witnessing ... it will sound cliched but it can't really hurt you, and iterations of it are more on their way out more than they are on their way in ... 

we always think the more damaging and difficult thoughts are grounded in some more authoritative place than the ones like ""does my dog know it's name?"" yet some we observe and let go, and some we think we NEED an answer to immediately or they will alter our reality somehow ... they won't, and the long path is to gradually realize that in hindsight ... the short path is to take a step back from tripping and do some simple meditation to begin to see clearly that while you witness your thoughts, they are not really a part of you and cannot do much besides pop up and float away ... i've posted this a few times but a simple meditation practice is to sit comfortably with your gaze resting a few feet in front of you, and just concentrate on your breathing ... breathe in, breathe out ... let your mind be silent ... of course, as you sit concentrating on your breathing, your mind will begin to wander ... when it does, no need to say yay/nay or judge the thoughts or wonder what their origin is ... simply say ""thinking"", and return to focusing on your breath ... in, and out, in and out ... it may take some time before your mind really quiets down, but the more time you spend in this practice (really even 10 minutes a day can do wonders) the more you will see that regardless of what the topic or form the thought comes in, it eventually retreats once you regard it as thought, and let it on it's way ... the same as your dog will always return with something when you throw something, your mind is just trying to help ... now this serves two purposes ... one, you'll give yourself a break and some quiet time to reshape your perspective about things that are troubling you ... ultimately, your views and ideas can be wonderfully helpful on your journey ... we can't understand everything perfectly right away, but if we refrain from quick judgments, and let our water sit until the mud settles, we can see things in a better way ... ideas that are not to your benefit are simply that ... perspectives that help us learn, grow, and not be so attached to things are always on the opposite side of any internal struggle, and of course it is difficult to see that when you're struggling, just as it's difficult to see the side of the river you're on before you cross it ... the second purpose, is to see that while judgments can pop up, your thoughts go in a wild number of directions during a day, during an hour, during even a ten minute period ... and where we direct our attention plays a big role in which of these thoughts trouble us and which we allow to move on ... ""pizza for lunch?"" your brain might say ... ""hell yeah"" might be the response ... and the thought moves on ... you're not dwelling on it and feeling nervous about what others might say about you eating pizza, and you're not shaking while you log onto seamless ... ""what if butterflies are really just drunk and that's why they fly like that?"" may pop in ... you think about some absolute nonsense and you think about some straightup gems of wisdom ... spend your time not invested in either, but discerning between the two without judgment of either ... in time, with this simple practice, you will often find that when you are in the silence, relaxed, the gems of wisdom will flow more freely than the worries, and when the worries do arise, you wont clench against them, but will allow them to sit until they solve themselves ... 

given the ""revelation"" aspect so many people report with psychedelics, maybe this is simply something you're seeing for the first time ... we often make the mistake of thinking change must be large, drastic, and explained to everyone ... really, it is gradual, rewarding, difficult in a way that brings a smile to our face, and things will help us along the way ... gradually growing as a person is as much about new and more positive habits as much as it is about reducing the things we judge ourselves harshly for, but both are useful ... when you were in school and learned that 4 x 8 is 32 ... you did not spend the next 24 hours judging your deep dark secret that you did not confront that of course 4 x 8 is 32 how could you have been so blind will you ever be THE SAME AGAIN? ... likely not, and you shouldn't try to assign this conversation any more importance ... in effect, and this will sound silly, the sum total wisdom in your conversation is that ""were things to be kept cleaner than they are currently, they would be cleaner than they are currently"" ... so, really, you've been presented with a choice, not installed with an anxiety ... choices are easy, just make one ... if in time you don't like it, you can always make another ... i think you'll be fine, but i also know you'll be fine ... om"

TripSit,fqf04s3,t1_fqeuyh4,1589316491.0,"seems like a tough place to do shrooms ... you probably do wanna do some googling though since there are some simple things about snakes you can learn to avoid them ... avoid tall grass, make noise while you're moving about, maybe carry a walking stick to poke about ahead of u, stick to the daytime where snakes are somewhat less active ... Christopher Ryan has a good story about getting stung by a scorpion while he was on lsd  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1EoUCM6x9A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1EoUCM6x9A)

my real advice is not gonna be for this trip ... you might wanna spend some time around some snakes to get past this ... poisonous critters should make you wary, but if you're freaking out googling snakes, it sounds like you're more scared of the idea of snakes than you are of snakes ... when you see one, they are a puzzle because you don't know what they're thinking or plan on doing, but they're mostly just unfortunate little fellers ... i'm a nice ball of goop, and i've got good hard sticks within me to let me bat at balls and move about, but snakes are kinda G'd ... they dunno what they are because their eyeballs are way out there, they're super short so you know they're having a tough time on tinder, and most of the time they encounter people is when a person sneaks up on them and surprises the shit out of them ... you are a literal giant to a snake, and they don't attack to try to eat you, they attack as a last resort because they think you are going to eat them, and you can ... so as much as i think going to a pet store and biting the bullet and holding a snake or just looking at them in the tank is a good step, you might wanna hit up a restaurant that serves snake and chow down on one or two ...

you have an interesting sitation because your fear of snakes is based on you giving your mind the attention when it suggests snakes .... 

mind ""LOOK AT THAT BUSH"" 

mustard ""ok yeah decent bush i fucks wit that"" 

mind ""WHAT IF THERE WERE SNAKES""

mustard ""AHHHHHHH""

ur mind's always gonna suggest the things ur scared of when you get in those situations, but ultimately it's gonna be you that says yay or nay to the suggestion ... still tho, poisonous snakes are a concern, and you're very alert but not super functional when you're tripping on shrooms, so you might wanna confine your trip to the cabin/deck, or you might wanna explore the trail/lake area sober ... sorry i know that's not the advice you want"

""in, and out"" ... think these two thoughts as each breath occurs ... in time your mind will quiet down and you will be more aware of the simple quiet awareness that is always there for you ... other things are just passing noise, but when you're on some substances they can be loud ... it kinda makes sense if you think about it though ... if you eat cookies or pizza while you're high they're way better ... if you drink water it's delicious (stay hydrated homey!) ... so the same kind of magnification effect can go on with scary thoughts ... you're not dying ... you're not drowning in sand ... and smoking weed may have intensified things, but you haven't made a mistake ... you're tripping balls, and this is the tough part, but the good and peaceful parts come after you let the tough parts make their noise and move on 

a tougher but equally interesting method of letting these kinds of thoughts pass is going into them ... when you're high they can seem more intense, and the ""what if"" game is always one that we are excellent at when tripping, but the thoughts don't actually change the world around us, and the effects of the drug are temporary ... you know that ... so if there are crazy visuals, relax and let them show you what they want to ... if you feel like you are drowning in sand, go all the way down ... letting your mind run with a thought can be very daunting, but you will often find that your mind runs out of ideas if you keep asking it questions ...

""im drowning in sand?  hmm where did all this sand come from?""

""im sinking?  weird because im on my couch where i usually don't sink""

""are there any animals in the sand?""

""can they help me out?""

if no, ""wow wtf animals""

this sounds silly but it's a preferable experience to clenching against an idea ... at best you'll hold onto the idea and suffer for as long as you can ... but even that will tire you out, and you'll move on to something else ... a change of scenery can be big as well ... being stationary when you're high lends itself to thinking and spacing out ... walking or getting some fresh air can really settle things, even just heading to another room to watch tv or listen to some peaceful music ... if you need some i always recommend Takashi Kokubo or Hiroshi Yoshimura

TripSit,fpfoxoo,t3_gd51m3,1588578273.0,"Hello Garrett. Cool name. Thank you for sharing this. I’m sorry about your car accident. Things like that can serve great purpose, but they are difficult to overcome and can require great effort. This post is a good start. Thank you for sharing your story, it is one I’m sure will help others share theirs as well, and that’s you, who feels as if they don’t have a place to turn in this confusing time, building a foundation towards others having a place to turn. Small steps, big results. We busy ourselves with what is wrong and what we have to fix and what troubles us, at the expense of what is simple, and what is true, and what is beautiful. This post is beautiful. This post is a doorway (yours not mine lol). Most people take psychedelics with not much idea what to expect. Having taken them, I think you’ll agree that it would be hard to describe the full range of effects it has, and that’s one of the beautiful things and also one of the things that keeps them as a taboo in society. I’m glad you feel like a part of you is trying to work past the pain. Trust this a little more. Quitting smoking, sleeping better, a more peaceful mind, these are things you can be grateful for, and can be in control of more and more as you go. There will always be things you may want to improve, and the balance is to use this strength to make the right decisions for you, and leave the judgement aside. It is not necessary, and while it seems that society and norms and values can lump these things on you, it is ultimately for you to cast aside the ideas that do not serve you. Judgment may come, criticism may arise, but you can let these things pass in time as simply as a cloud passes thru the sky.

3.5 grams. That’s a heavy dose. Because shrooms are kinda taboo, I’m not sure what the effects are for a 17 year old, but that’s where ur research will be useful. Do it (the research), in time you’ll find that one of the consistently rewarding things in life is reading, and learning. MAPS has some good scientific resources to learn more about psychedelics. Psychedelics can strip away certain ideas we cling to, and this allows for a couple things. One, and you experienced this, is you’re able to take a fresh, judgment free look at yourself. You see things it is time to forgive yourself for, you see things you’d like to change in the future, you see that ultimately, you do love yourself and peace and love are your natural state. Two, they can put you in a bit of a pickle because you’ve had a bunch of considerable thoughts and new perspectives, but given their “source”, you can’t just talk about them with anyone. It is easy for people to be scared or nervous about a young person using these type of drugs, and at the worst instance, their concern or criticism is the best they are able to express their love. It doesn’t mean it will all translate well, and it doesn’t mean that some of it doesn’t have some degree of truth or wisdom, but ultimately it is a beautiful thing that they are trying to help. Sometimes a turtle will try to push a fish out of the water so it doesn’t drown, and sometimes a gorilla will guard a baby who has fallen into the zoo cage. It’s a mixed bag, but it all comes from the same place whether they know it or not. In our hearts we are love, and a lot of who you are is how much you’re willing to express that, and how much you’re willing to see that in others.

Going back to the things you felt and thought during the trip, a good analogy I would offer is that psychedelics can be like a fast forward button, to wisdom and considerations and emotions that you may not completely understand. Some of it may be useful, some of it may be lifechanging, some of it may be best discarded, but as of right now, they are all just thoughts. A good practice for any trip is to take an extended period afterward to take these ideas and lessons, and really see which benefit you, which help you love yourself and others more, and which are best discarded. Luckily, since they’re ultimately just thoughts, it’ll be simple to discard the shtuff that’s fluff or doesn’t serve you. A quiet mind is the best place to do this kind of thinking, so what I’d really recommend now more than anything, is that you take some time to practice some form of meditation. The simplest one is breathing. Sit comfortably (you can cross your legs or sit in a chair), and let your eyes rest focusing a few feet in front of you. Let your mind go quiet and focus on your breathing. In, and out. In, and out. You will find your mind begins to wander. When it does, no worries. Say “thinking” and let the thought pass. Focus again on your breathing. In, and out. In, and out. This may be tough at first, despite how simple it sounds. Our minds are naturally noisy, and we live fast-paced lives. This practice for a few minutes a day can get you to a place where your mind does quiet down a bit. You’ll find it very similar to what you experienced on parts of the trip, but the bonus here homey is that while it is a more subtle experience, it is there whenever you need it. You’ll find as well that though your mind does often begin to wander, your thinking will become clearer and more useful in this “state.”

Meditation is a good practice, and something that helped me during a similarly difficult period is listening to people who’ve spent their lives talking about these very things. Spend some time listening to the zen teachings and beautiful voice of Alan Watts. Listen to Ram Dass talk calmly and peacefully about love. Let Terrence McKenna hypothesize about the most interesting stuff and throw in some of the funniest one liners you’ve ever heard in the midst of the most simple yet complex understanding of the universe we’ve ever seen. Listen to Mooji’s gentle teachings. There is no wisdom achievable through psychedelics that you cannot learn equally well and with less agitation than in the teachings of these men, and I know tripping is fun, but it is a much safer route to go, at least until ur a little older homey.  Anyway, thank you for sharing, and I think a lotta people would really enjoy it if you check back in from time to time and let us know how you’re doing. Maybe you’ll wind up becoming a zen master or an NFL mascot or maybe you’ll own some elephants idk what kids are into these days. If you need help with anything, there’re always people here who care.  om."

if people aren't regulars on Tripsit they're likely not going to feel like coming back and revisiting a tough time, no matter how universal people here insist it is ... generally when these conditions arise it's just a scary thought or a very effective ""what if"" and you fight it and ""what if"" it until you've becoming the quaking mess Watts always talks about ... the problem with this situation is that stimulus becomes agitating ... going on your phone to look for a ground or calming influence can be too much ... music can be too much ... typing can be too much ... light can be too much ... dark can be too much ... all because ""YOU HAVEN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION!  YOU'RE UNCERTAIN!""  ... so people may not want to come back to their post while they're still tripping unless they're way into the comedown stage ... the good news in all this is that since the thought can differ for people, and the offending stimulus can differ for people, it is not a real danger, but a phantom to be overcome ... with so much of our lives being routine, uncertainty can be jarring, but uncertainty does not dictate the present, the future, the past ... it changes nothing ... it's just your brain saying ""idk"" ... i'm not saying i haven't been in a panic (i get a little shaky writing responses sometimes trying to get into the same state as the poster to see what the best advice might be), but i would say that it is worth exploring when you are there, to really poke at the phantom before you and see what it's really made of ... is uncertainty having a real effect on the world around us, if we don't come up with an answer what happens ... the ego needs to know everything and maintain some feeling of control to feel ok ... you don't ... you can sit in the ego and autopilot through your day, but you can also stare a tiger in the face and remain an unblinking presence ... is this thing really scary ... is not knowing, and witnessing really so unbearable ... that will always be the question ... mostly, you get past these things ... if you explore them, you'll find they aren't real, and this is their last visit ... there are beautiful lessons on the other side, and a sense of peace ... 

on a less wacky scale, after some time poking at the things or letting thoughts ride out you will find they run out of ideas ... ""ok and what then"" ""ok and what then"" ... your mind is good at playing the game but not really interested in playing it long term ... if you explore the thing without judgment for a bit you'll also quickly find that while you're still absorbed in it, your state has calmed down ... we lend our thoughts our attention and create these states ... it sometimes requires you to see this for yourself though to move you beyond it ... and when you're tripping balls, it's difficult to remember this : )

if you've ever been having a difficult dream and decided to turn towards the terror, you'll find often that your dream cannot come up with anything to put there ...

TripSit,fo7xqrs,t3_g5wx7e,1587586352.0,"Trip gone sideways ... keep in mind that everything you wrote, everything you felt, and may still feel, was categorized under trip gone sideways ... so for all its intensity, and for all the power you lent it while tripping, it is a temporary part of you, and even in that state you identified this (whether consciously or subconsciously) ... when we feel these things, and explore them, there is a recognition that we are a bit ""off-center"" when we are feeling them ... but we tend to overlook our inevitable return to center in the experience, and feel these things deeply ... the ""what if"" game we play in our brain coupled with the illusion of needing an answer for everything can lend a feeling of helplessness to this, and our knee-jerk reaction is to struggle against the emotions ... ""it's bad? it's a struggle"" our brain keys on these thoughts if you lend them your attention and the experience can heighten ... of course, through no fault of your own, this struggle doesn't quite work in your favor ... it would if you were being eaten by a scrappy woodchuck, or a series of beavers ... ""this is no good"" your brain would say, and a series of alarms and physical sensors would alert you, and you'd struggle away ... now beavers can go up to 10km/hr in the water, so you're going to want to make your escape on land) ... unfortunately, feelings are not beavers ... 

think about when you are angry about something, and try to ignore it ... every iteration of the offender will add a little bit more, and here's the tricky thing ... somewhere along the line we learn to associate things, and make judgments from them ... when we encounter a thing we like like pizza, we associate it with all the other pizzas we've eaten in the past, and we're happy at the thought ... when we encounter a cop, we might be wary based on past experiences with cops ... we can do this same thing with our feelings ... when you feel bad, your mind suggests to you of all the other times you felt bad (your mind is often making associations in the decisionmaking process), and often instead of living just the moment we're in, we add in the full weight of all the past instances ... ""is this like that?"" says your mind, and you are suddenly reminded of it all ... ""oh my god"" ... ""all of that"" ... and so you live it ... you live it all ... how bad can it get? ... well, that was it ... all the grief, all the negativity, unresolved, all at once ... and here you are ... 

although you can cling to it for a bit longer, you will find that these feelings are on their way out ... things we cling to are often noisiest as we are letting them go ... if something is angering you, and it keeps occurring, we internalize it and eventually it builds to where you are immersed in it, then release it … after you do, you generally feel a bit better ... maybe you punch a wall, maybe you yell at the person who is chewing so loud ... the wall is surprised ... the person is unsure how you are suddenly so mad ... and so the ego is similarly surprised ... you mentioned you've been dealing with loss and a difficult period ... this chips away in a similar way, and this experience was the ultimate release of that built-up sorrow ... there is a tendency for the ego to take these things personally ... ""me bad? i feel so bad ... this is me?"" ... “who can i blame for this?” … when external forces hurt us, they can cause us to experience anger or sorrow ... we may place blame ... ""fuck this person"" ""why'd they leave"" ... when these emotions seem to emanate internally as they do in the grieving process, there is a tendency to blame ourselves ... that's the second wave of the mind, and where the ""I'm a bad part of the world"" and other negative thoughts come in ... they feel like certainties to us, but they are just the guesses of the ego which cannot abide uncertainty ... but you are certain ... you love yourself enough to face these things and know that they are not true ... when you do, they will pass

psychedelics have a tendency to bring things up that we've been harboring and say ""hey do you still want this?"" ... because we're always hanging onto ideas and stuff ... and unfortunately, you can't let it go without taking a look at it first ... so you took a look ... if you didn't love yourself, you wouldn't have been able to ... at no point in witnessing or harboring an idea does it become you though ... so you took a major step ... you acknowledged the grief and sorrow you were carrying ... now comes the second step ... forgiving yourself for carrying it for so long ... at your center your are peace, you are love ... and while you may immerse yourself elsewhere, you will always return ... om"

TripSit,fm9pnt9,t3_fttcpz,1585873758.0,"man if everyone on the planet couldn’t write this same exact post at one time or another … thank you for sharing … there is an honesty and awareness in your words that tells me you are already on your way out of this situation and on to a better and more beneficial perspective … psychedelics often present a fresh chance to look at things we carry with us all the time, and while that can be overwhelming, difficult, and agitating, there are often healthy lessons on the other end of taking a peek …

we all have this tendency to keep an overinflated necessary-goal version of ourselves … this set of inflated expectations that are tied to things we are told about ourselves and things we tell ourselves … who is insisting that we reach these goals? what changes if we don’t? what effects does lending this image any importance have? while this creation is just a byproduct of societal interactions and norms, it is not a necessary part of you or anyone … two things you recognized right away in your post … one, this image is constantly cultivated in a way that keeps it out of your reach … two, it is a fantasy (grounded in nothing) … so what we really all have, is an idea that we’ve been working on for a while, that kinda just serves only to constantly limit how good we’re able to feel at any given moment … a neat trick, but not of much use … but it’s a good way to drive ourselves to improve! … not really, if all improvements or thoughts of pursuing them are met with a new phantom you who you cannot compete with … it’s like having a boat, that floats away when you come near it … i’m not going to bother having that boat for very long …

so it’s on it’s way out … you are witnessing it when you’re on psychedelics not because this is something permanent or something you have to overcome, but because it is on it’s way out (like all ideas always are) … you see it and sample it … it makes you feel stuck, unworthy, and disappointed … neat, thx idea, you’ve been great, now you can go … because the idea is not you … the idea is reporting to you … and while it may seem like something that can trouble you for a while, since you’re always having to update it, it is actually not a large opponent … each iteration is a new idea … you are the customer … “are you buying this one? you bought this one last time” … if someone is selling you fruits that taste bad and are unhealthy, how many would you like? one of the things that people often talk about with psychedelics is “going with it” and that is something to consider here … when presented with an idea that serves you no purpose, treat it as you would the purveyor of nonsense fruit … ""yes ok thx that's very nice goodbye"" ...  why does it feel so strong?  well it's on it's way out, since you're seeing it clearly now as something that isn't your preference ... of course it is going to mount some argument for itself, and while you're tripping you're not in much of a state to debate ... one way ppl get a bit frazzled in a trip is to buy into an idea … “what if x” and you say “oh that is a scary thought, i hope it is not true” and your brain does the calculations like a good little brain and comes back “IF IT WAS THEN THIS” and you’re well on your way to a very difficult 10-15 minutes … but once that thought fades, it’s gone unless you need it back … and while you don’t need the bad thoughts back, it raises a key point about this “goal self” … it is always there when you need it if you ever should … when you have time and when you want to reflect, you will always be able to find things to change and work on … what the “goal self” leaves out though is all the things that you have done … all the good … all the wisdom … all the growth … all the love that you have put into the world, and into your self … because an idea, no idea, can contain all of you, all of time, all of anything …

some things to consider when outside of this state are that an idea that cannot be completed can never be completed, so there is no way to feel other than stuck … your feelings aren’t wrong, or something to fight, but you will find in time that when you are feeling this way, you are munching on bad fruit … this is difficult to remember when you’re tripping, and your heightened perception can make anything seem very pertinent and intense … honestly, since no one knows you better than you, it’s very important to take self-criticism with a grain of salt … the image others maintain of us, however critical, will never surpass the one we do (or did, in your case) … so when these thoughts come, be aware of them … you’ll find that they serve not much purpose, but also that their impact will begin to fade over time as you put less and less stock in them … when you are looking to make changes or work on something, you’ll also find this type of thought doesn’t occur until it pops up to suggest you stop … “you’ll never be ripped, why finish the workout” “don’t take that job, you’re starting at the bottom” “you can’t end a bad relationship, you’ll be single and PEOPLE WILL KNOW” … it’s doubt, it’s self-consciousness, but at the end of the day, it’s just noise … leave it behind … 

if there’s anything i can do to help, let me know … this is a very big topic and there are many ways to approach and discuss it, so if anything helps, feel free to use it, and if anything doesn’t line up, feel free to discard it …"

highthoughts,flw4crr,t3_frj7ll,1585539327.0,"you probably won't stop thinking, but over time, if you wish to, you can slowly stop identifying, clinging to, and being moved by thoughts ... this is the cause of much of people's suffering, and it isn't an overnight process, but it is manageable ... a good practice to begin seeing that this is possible is a simple meditation trick ... sit quietly, and concentrate on your breath ... don't think about anything ... when your mind begins to wander (it will), notice it, say ""thinking"" to yourself (doesn't have to be out loud), and let those thoughts pass ... focus back on your breathing ... each time your mind wanders, repeat this process ... you will find that in time, a few things happen ... one, all of the thoughts that arise, will fade as you go back to focusing on your breathing ... thoughts are not permanent, and their effect on you should not be ... they are like a breeze that you experience, but are not defined by, and actually cannot hang on to ... the same frustration a child trying to catch a breeze would experience is the same frustration arguing with or clinging with a thought can cause ... two, you will gradually (may take a few times doing this practice for 10/20 minutes) become to experience a calm, and very peaceful quiet in your mind ... once you notice this your mind will likely immediately start to chatter again ... this isn't a problem ... it's similar to how if you're dreaming, and realize it's a dream, you usually immediately wake up ... three, after some time experience short bouts of silence, you may find that the thinking you ARE doing when your mind begins to wander becomes more useful ... now this practice is useful for a couple minutes a day, but i'm recommending it more to show yourself that while overthinking things can wind you up, it isn't a permanent situation ... we all do it, but once you realize you're doing it, you're on the way to being free from it ... not the thoughts, but being agitated by them"

Physics,fltcw31,t3_fr0vdr,1585467543.0,"Mckenna was one of the most brilliant modern philosophers you will encounter.  He had excellent logic in analyzing societal shifts, corrective measures, and both personal and collective trends and motivations.  Him and his brother were very well educated (terrence completed his bachelors and i believe Dennis completed a doctorate).  The grain of salt is necessary  when regarding his time hypothesis, which is not backed up by current science or the science of that period.  So people refuting him as someone who ""took too much drugs"" have the right answer in that his mathematical theories he was working on towards the end of his career as a public figure are not proved or grounded, but the wrong reasoning as to what discounts it."
