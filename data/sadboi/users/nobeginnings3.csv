schizoaffective,ffp7fkh,t3_eubrkg,1580088117.0,"I know it’s nerve racking but you can do it for sure! I got pregnant 2 years into my diagnosis, at 19 years old. Pregnancy was the best thing that ever happened to me. I was able to get off my medicine completely and felt better than I ever had in my life. That being said, every pregnancy is different. Not sure if you have the bipolar or depressive side (or both), but my psychiatrist said it’s the best thing for folks with the bipolar side. Just really watch out for post-partum depression, that hit me like a sack of bricks. My girl is now almost 3 and is the light of my life! It wasn’t easy but you are a resilient warrior that I know can get through anything you set your mind to! Best of luck lady!"
schizoaffective,fccg2jx,t3_ecncdb,1577597982.0,"I took lsd (half a tab) almost a week ago exactly. About 3 hours in my body started physically rejecting it. I threw up until I could throw up any more. Then I drank some water, threw that up. Then I started throwing up terrible tasting froth. It sent me into a manic state and started on seroquel. Tread lightly friend."

I feel comfortable going back to work Monday but if I didn’t I would have a supportive family member....maybe mom or dad? ..,.Start googling or talking to your psychiatrist about how to get on a medical leave. I have not tried one for work yet but I can almost guarantee you’ll be able to. Wishing you well"
schizoaffective,fcbxfrx,t3_eh046u,1577592048.0,Hi there! I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective about 6 years ago. What your describing happens(ed) to me constantly. It really pisses me off when people will come up to me and wave their hand in front of my face. I get it’s weird and I still hate that I do it. Ive rationalized it as it’s [how ever many seconds I’m looking at the item] to let my brain stop racing and “breath” for a moment. Hope this helps ❤️
