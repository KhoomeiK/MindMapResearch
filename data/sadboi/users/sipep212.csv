The problem with rescue breaths, more so by a BVM or the older positive pressure set ups on O2 bottles was gastric inflation. Nothing like doing CPR for a few minutes and the victim suddenly looking pregnant.  What goes down will come up, so you can easily cause them to regurgitate and aspirate their stomach contents, including any chlorinated water the victim ingested while drowning. Back in the day when I went through EMT school, we were taught to do the Heimlich maneuver first during CPR on only a drowning victim to try to get any excess water out of the airway. I've only done mouth to mouth once, and that was on a traumatic CPR of a five year old girl that was ejected during a rollover. We were down our first up medical truck and didn't have any of our pedi airway equipment. We also used positive pressure O2 for rescue breaths. I opted for mouth to mouth to avoid over inflation of her lungs or gastric distention.   I knew she was completely gone when she pissed in my arms while I did CPR.

The problem then is you can adequately tell which way water will drip, what will rub where, what wires get crimped at what angle, etc.  If they customized Boeing 777s, those things would crash every few days.  I watched that show Air Disasters and gained some insight watching how the NTSB investigates crashes and how often it can be a slight design flaw or the strength of a part that can bring the whole damn thing down.  We lost a two billion dollar B2 stealth bomber because of a sensor that got moisture in it.  What I'm getting at is even custom rigs should have limits as to what is customizable.  777s can have their seating altered, as could custom engines.  A 777 can't have the fuselage extended by 1 2/5th inch because it can cause unforeseen problems.  Currently, when a design flaw is the cause of a plane crash, the FAA sends out recommendations to have that flaw fixed.   Imagine if a department in South Bend, Indiana found the outriggers on their truck were grinding.  The manufacturers find a washer wasn't a locking washer causing it to fall off I to the gears or whatever.  They design a fix and let every department nationwide know how to fix the flaw.  It would save so much money and time.  Customization could be modular, allowing for the needs of a department to be filled, within reason.   That extra 1/8 inch in the compartment  that is there because someone on the design/purchasing committee gets a wild hair up their ass...that shit needs to stop.  Look at the options on passenger cars and trucks,  you have a lot of options.  Same could be done with custom fire apparatus.   

Name a manufacturer on here and someone will have a rig with problems and others will swear by them. 


I will say two things:

If the diesel exhaust filter needs to be cycled, go out of service for 20 minutes and drive it until it finished cycling.  Failure to do so will cause thousands to repair.

With the current fly by wire electronics,  slight voltage issues can reek havoc on your rig.  A rig in a nearby department was driving back from a call when it shifted into reverse on it's own, the air horns locked open, and a few warning lights turned on.  Had to be towed by a $300 an hour, minimum three hour, heavy duty wrecker. Had to have a 24 hour emergency vehicle mechanic called in.  Cost quite a bit.  Problem found??   A cell in a battery was bad.

Change the batteries yearly with brand new ones.  Have the alternator checked yearly.  Hell, you can sell or trade in the used batteries to recoup some of the cost.  They can be used in non emergency vehicle heavy duty trucks.  But for an $800k rig, a set of new batteries is a cheap insurance plan."

I bought one of the black fundraiser memorial shirts from y'alls last LODD. Thought that was a great idea and it turned out really nice. Hopefully the money was enough to bridge the gap until state and federal LODD money comes in. In Texas, your children get to go to any state college or university free if you are killed.  That helps a lot down the road so the state and federal money can be used by the surviving parent without feeling guilty for not saving for college.

Then I watched this episode and any sense of somewhat realism that makes a story compelling went right out the window.  Rookie cop gets immediate access to a serial killer in prison.  Not enough evidence to turn over to Internal Affairs.  Internal Affairs is in a witness officer, out a suspect officer.  They could have shared their suspicions.  I could go on and on but most has been covered already.  


Last episode I had a glimmer of hope for the series that I hadn't seen since the start of the show.  It is a great premise for a show.  At this point they might as well have a crossover to start Season 3 with Picard beaming Nolan out of jail then warping away to another planet to pick up light sabers and a Wookie.  Then change the show to The Wookie.  Chewbacca's son becomes an LAPD officer and Nolan trains him with the help of his new Watch Commander, Captain America.  Will Smith could train an alien officer too...oh wait."
