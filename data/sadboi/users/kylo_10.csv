The unspoken rule is that the person on the register furthest to the left always takes Premiere guests until there are none remaining. Whoever is on the other registers generally takes the regular line only, unless the Premiere line’s a little backed up. We’ve never had an issue with a long premiere line; there are never more than 4-5 people in it at our busiest times. Our regular line is usually at least 3 times longer than our premiere line.

I can also confirm that SO MANY guests in the regular line complain. I hate being on the register that calls Premiere guests because I always get people in the regular line like “I was here first!” I wonder if they just don’t know why there are two lines."

1. The Leia scene in TLJ, like it or not, is not in any way disrespectful to Carrie, and I’ve never heard anyone else be actually offended by it.

2. If you hate the new movies so much, maybe spend time on something else. You’ve spent so much time typing up the longest responses I’ve ever seen on a Reddit thread, when you could be doing something or talking about something that you actually enjoy. It’s totally fine if you don’t like the new movies. There are people who agree with you. But why spend so much time talking about something that you hate? I think Batman vs Superman sucks, but how often do I even think about it? 
Now, I get it. I know that when you’ve loved a franchise for a long time it’s hard when it goes in a direction that you don’t like. I’m not trying at all to be disrespectful to your feelings on Star Wars, because I’d be devastated too if I didn’t like a new Star Wars movie. And I totally understand why you would be so upset when you didn’t like The Last Jedi. But at some point you have to move on.

There are always going to be some former fans that don’t agree with what Disney’s doing.

If you’re looking to duel with a lightsaber this isn’t for you. But for all other purposes (display, learning spin tricks, etc) it’s a great saber. My only gripe is that I wanted a yellow saber so I bought a yellow crystal and turns out the yellow isn’t very yellow at all. But I actually like mine white now, so it’s not a huge deal.

Like they don’t usually seem THIS confident. And why would October 21st even come up if there wasn’t a valid reason? No one was thinking it would happen on the 21st, so I feel like they have to have heard something very credible. It could even be Lucasfilm feeding them info to create buzz.
