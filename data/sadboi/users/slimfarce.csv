AskReddit,f5t3ist,t3_dp56ya,1572449631.0,"A professor i had in college helped me through a deep depressive period. He noticed i was withdrawn and wasn‚Äôt making it to class as often as i should. He emailed me and i told him everything i was going through, and he was there for me. He told me about the student counciling center (I didn‚Äôt know my campus had one) and let me take a few days off. He continued to email me every few days after throughout the year to check on me and see how i was feeling. I credit him for helping me pass that semester. 
A few years later (& in a much better mental state), i had the opportunity to study abroad with him and we had a great time. After the trip, he moved to another state but we still talk regularly. He is, hands down, one of the most caring people I‚Äôve met."
