I would say you should watch him take them but be gentle with that. Some people after recovery stops taking them but it usually ends with psychosis relapse.

For example me after getting medications I was tired all the time, I was sleeping many hours and I felt my emotions were suppressed. But after I recovered I consulted with my psychiatrist and we decided to lower the dose and now it is just fine. I live now a decent productive life and I am able to hold a fine job.
