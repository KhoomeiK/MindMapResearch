depression,fqsk74j,t3_gkmzcq,1589609604.0,"I felt the same way too all through my life and it intensified during college. I used to feel a lot of dread about myself and my future. I used to think that I was nothing and wasn't as special or talented as the rest of my peers. I would think my life would be better on everyone if I didn't really necessarily existed anymore. I hated my life and I hated everything about me.

I can't really offer you much because I tend to have those same thoughts, but they're not as frequent or as loud as they were before. The only thing that helped me through my days from college til now is just taking it one day at a time, step by step. It's hard to really see a bright future for yourself when you keep this sign in front of you that your life is meaningless. No one can do anything for you or define your life except for yourself. You don't have to leap off a cliff of change to make your life better. You just need to take a breath, define who you are and what makes you happy, and just take it bit by tiny bit. Eventually, the future will be a bit better for you slowly."

hingeapp,fovphht,t1_forbgyj,1588105278.0,"Agree. Based on what OP keeps commenting on, he seems to think to be 5'6 kills all chances of matching with a girl and thinks lying about a man's height is alright because shorter girls won't tell the difference (which is a recipe for disaster so please do not ever lie about your height.) I say that yeah, it kills your chances with a girl who is only factoring height as the main reason to date someone. Someone's physical appearance should not be the only factor in swiping on someone. For me, I like their prompts and the kind of answers they give and also if they're close by to me since I do not want to be in traffic for an hour just to see someone. But also these are just preferences just like a person's location and wittiness are my preferences. And with some women, a man's height is their preferences too. And with some people, a person's height is not really important enough to balance whether or not they are worth talking to.

Focusing on height and making it sound like a problem ends up being a problem because you'll just end up like that guy who yelled at female bagel shop employees and blaming them for his inability to find a girl on a dating site. If there are men out there who can find someone to date them when they're 5'3"", surely it is not impossible to find a great partner out there."
hingeapp,fovmb9h,t3_g9mi8r,1588103729.0,"One reason would be the obvious - no reciprocation in the conversation. Just a lot of short answers, lack of engaging responses, overall boredom I get from the person I'm messaging. I like to talk to someone and keep topics light or in-depth. If I can't get the same feeling from you, I won't talk anymore.

Another reason is that I might stop is no real chemistry. Someone might sound great in their profile, but after talking to them they just might not sound like the same person they represented in their profile. I will respect someone's opinions and personality, but I am also aware that neither of us would mesh well together.

Lastly, I would say just finding someone else I like a lot more. I'm guilty of that. I'll just stop responding because I found someone I vibe with."

Most of the time, no one can really tell the difference in how tall an individual is and that should be the case. Some people don't care unless you make a big deal out of it. We shouldn't be focusing on the height of anyone, but more so the conversations you have with someone. Their physical appearance is not supposed to be an issue unless it poses a threat to their health.

I am in no way saying that you won't get dates if you do or don't include your height. I just think that height should not be the singular factor in dating a person at all."

AskReddit,flzyyv1,t3_fs7sbw,1585638345.0,"Get ready, this one is a trainwreck.

Dated this football player guy (L) from freshman to sophomore year. He checked everything off my list: nice, conversationalist, cute, loved animals, got along with my friends and family. What was a plus was that he was popular so he was friends with everyone and always stood up for the little guy. I adored him back then. We were both little kids in love, all naive and shit. Then he broke up with me and I cried. Then he wanted to get together three days later. Two weeks later I heard from a friend he and my sister's friend (E) were becoming extremely friendly with eachother. I tried to slap him. Didn't work, but we broke up.

They started dating shortly after and I spent every other day for 4 months crying about this. Every fucking person knew what happened in our grade since he was popular. His friends, cheered when he broke up with me because they thought I took up all his time (dude would basically ditch his friends to hang with me despite me always telling him not to do that.) Some little asshole made fun of me because I didn't put out and that's why he left me to date E. I flipped out on him, but I couldn't fucking punch him because I was a part of a sports team and would get kicked off if I did anything violent. Oh and let me not forget to say that in my sophomore year, E and I were in the same Spanish class so I would see them walk to class together and kiss goodbye before she would sheepishly walk inside the room and avoid my glare. It was an extremely uncomfortable year in Spanish II. But let me tell you: what I just described was only half of the bullshit I went through in those four months.

While healing my broken heart from my first relationship, L would come by my house and try to talk about our relationship. He would say that he still missed me and loved me and wanted me. But then turn back and say I misunderstood especially the one time E took my friend's cell phone and pretended to be my friend in order to talk me into forgiving E. Anyway, I eventually got fed up with the drama and told L that he has to make a decision: either he stops playing with me or be serious about me.

He broke up with E two weeks later and we started dating yet again. And, since I was extremely petty back then, I would walk to my Spanish class and kiss him goodbye and make sure E saw everything. Month passes by before L and I hit an extremely awkward stop. We were playing Truth or Dare with other people and when it came to his turn, he chose truth. So the question was, ""if you weren't dating Penelope (not my real name,) who would you be dating?"" I thought he would say me, but his answer caught me off guard. He said A.
A? I thought. Who the fuck was A?
Awkward silence happened and I was staring at L, getting ready to fucking stab him. Anyway, we got into an arguement shortly after when I learned that A is this girl who's in 8th grade and started being friends with each other. I decided to break up with him completely and shortly after, he dated A.

That was my very dramatic high school love story. There's another one, but it has less betrayal and a much more cuter ending."

I don't want to judge you, but he sounds like a very abusive and controlling boyfriend. I've been with other guys, fucked or in a relationship with, and none of them has never EVER treated me in this kind of manner. None of them have ever prevented me from taking my medication, has talked about impregnating me (which that itself is creepy that he's obsessed with that,) and has misogynistic views on women. Any one of those would be a good enough reason for me to cut them the fuck out of my life especially the birth control pills because I take those for health reasons.

Why would you want to be with someone who is trying trap you into a relationship by getting you pregnant? I'm not going to say you're going to live a miserable life, but do you really want a life with someone who is knowingly trying to knock you up and prevent you from taking your pills? Drop him please.

hingeapp,fcgumi6,t3_egrwkg,1577644148.0,"I've found way more success on Hinge than Bumble or Tinder. I went on to date someone from the app for a while. I just find conversations on there to be a little more organic and authentic compared to other apps. In my opinion, it's not the greatest app but it definitely stands out for me compared to other dating apps."
