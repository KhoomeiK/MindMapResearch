I was raised by parents who were very negative about food and weight (aka the left column) and what I was taught in treatment was very similar to the right column. I was taught in treatment that around impressionable people and children, to be neutral about body size, ‚Äúgood and bad foods‚Äù, calories, and the like! I understand that many of you were not fully educated on this subject but I just wanted to say that some of these types of comments can be very upsetting to people going through EDs or recovery."
