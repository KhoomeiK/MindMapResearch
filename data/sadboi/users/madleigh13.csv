Try journaling your thoughts, behaviors, and actions daily, then ensure to reflect & practice gratitude. These things saved me when I couldnâ€™t afford therapy. 

Praying for you, and hope you know youâ€™re not alone in this fight! ðŸ’œ"

Mine is slowly fading, but Iâ€™ve been turned off to sex and intimacy (previously) & the assault/rape made me into a totally different version of myself. Someone myself and my immediate family & friends didnâ€™t recognize. Thank god for a support system, I honestly thought I was drowning in the shame & guilt for the beginning of my 20â€™s (I was raised & confirmed Catholic)."
