PrequelMemes,foin7a5,t1_foimz3i,1587791044.0,"No he did not but, did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself."

houston,fk38pcb,t1_fk2hahl,1583821973.0,It’s really happening and I understand your skepticism. This is reddit. I’m just so fucking mad and I posted this because I had a nurse tell me earlier that she is guilty of using her phone while driving and will stop doing so after what I told her. I just want people to understand how awful it is. My son will be ok but sitting in a children’s icu makes you think. Like how many more children are going to get hurt due to negligent adults. He didn’t do anything wrong and is the sweetest little child. No child should go through this. I wish I could broadcast cast this on the news but this is the closest I can get. Stop using phones while driving please. It’s not worth it.

Turned on the news and it was showing on the tv before any news van had gotten to the scene(was next to the news van as I was going to work). Yesterday I came into work and someone was telling me they felt their house shake and thought it was an explosion. I turned on the news and all the information was on the news. Houston has had a crazy week.

I thought it was just me but I looked at the mechanic and he was looking at me and asked if I had seen that. I nodded and said yeah and that was it. We never questioned it. If he hadn’t seen it too I would have thought I was crazy.
