But I happen to have played quite a bit of fallout, but that doesn't mean I'm a man because I think of it.
If a man relates to the first photo rather than the second (because he isn't a gamer), that doesn't mean he thinks like a woman.

My sister has a dog with anxiety, especially around other dogs (it was attacked as a puppy). So if another dog gets too close he goes in full panic mode, and could possibly hurt someone. 
So just keep your dog on a leash, when outside of private homes and dog parks.

""Coming down"" can be very hard to listen to (especially when watching the video), but the thought that a single friend can help you from taking your own life is really strong, especially since I have a person who literally saved me from it, and made sure I wasn't alone.
""Remember everything"" is more when I need to get out all the emotional baggage of having a shitty childhood and feeling like I disappoint everyone. Because sometimes crying is the best way to get rid of some of the negative energy."

I know how hard this road is, and being able to give bad/abusive parents the blame they deserve can be very difficult. It will take time, and that is okay.
Just remember that even if your parents grew up with the worst past imaginable, it is still their responsibility to be good parents, as they chose to have you. 
This is also why we must fight to become better than them, and prove to ourselves that you can still be a good person, even if you had a terrible past.
You are brave for fighting, you are amazing, you deserve a good life, and please take care of yourself as this road can be very draining on your mental and physical health ♥️"

Second of all, you can not write this much, and remember this much without at least some of it being real. If it was maybe one weird feeling or mental picture, then you may be able to discuss whether it happened or not, but with the amount of memories and weird feelings you have, it had to be true to some degree. 
I obviously can't tell you whether something happened or not, but I have no doubt that you have been through hell, and the fact that you are still standing is absolutely amazing.

If you do not already have it, consider getting a therapist, and if you already do, maybe try talking with the therapist to find out if he/she can sit down and talk with your parents, so they will understand the situation you are in.

And above all else take care of yourself, do what you feel is right for you, what I'm saying is simply a suggestion."

Just prepare yourself that they might just reflect the problems, since narcissist hate admitting that they fucked up.
And I'm really sorry about how they treat you. It's not uncommon for parents to push their children towards goals, but that is not what they are doing. They are reflecting themselves onto you, so of they see you succeed (according to their goals), it's because of their ""great"" parenting.

Even if your father don't think it's sexual abuse, he should still take your feeling serious, and try to understand how he can best support you.
