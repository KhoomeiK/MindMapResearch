I know there is hope, I know I just have to talk to someone, it is better to talk to someone than it is to end it all and have the pain transfer to someone else who loved you. My ex has tried to kill himself and he always said I’d find better but I always told him that he would be my one and only. Me and him don’t talk anymore and it’s all my fault, I miss him, I get dark thoughts thinking about how I messed up but I know that ending it isn’t the answer."
