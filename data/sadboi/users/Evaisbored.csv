It was eighth grade in our algebra class and my friend Robbie, he was the smartest in the class but that day he kept getting all the problems wrong. At one point he got the answer 0 when it was like 60 or something. Our algebra teacher would usually say something like “oh dear” or “how did you get that?!” with a confused expression. Today though she just couldn’t help herself and said (keep in mind this is catholic school) “I think there is something wrong with the calculator God gave you” we all burst out laughing because she basically called him a dumbass.

AskReddit,f7aldjn,t3_duso2y,1573532327.0,My dog knows how to open water bottles and drink them. He knows it gets messy so he doesn’t open it all the way so he doesn’t spill it completely. We have to hide them but if we have children over and they leave some water bottles w/ some water we give them to him. He knows how to open his cage so I had to tie the door into place now. He knows how to open doors with his paws and will eat his food when we eat our food. When we lived in our old house we had a large patio with a bunch of plants. When we watered the plants and they leaked some water he would just drink that water. He would also just feed himself from his food bag. He didn’t over eat or under eat so I never worried and to this day he still feeds himself. All I really have to do is take him out to potty.
AskReddit,f6h8whx,t3_dr82rj,1572839917.0,"Yeah I do it a lot but one of the memories that recurs the most is something that happened last year at a school field trip. We went to this wilderness thing as a class (I was in eighth grade and we were a small school so it was 20 of us in our grade). The point was to be closer with each other and stuff so we did trust falls and stuff. I participated for the most part but then we went to this rock climbing obstacle course type thing. I am a really bad fear of heights and I decided to not even try. My teachers and the people that worked at the retreat were giving me so much shit for it and gave me an attitude. Finally we go to the last part, zip lining. But to zipline we had to do veryyyyy high rock climbing. I was legit thinking about doing but then I realized I didn’t have to guts to do it. I got even more shit for it until I decided to just try. So I did but then halfway I started having a panic attack and they brought me down. My friends had to motion the teachers to leave me alone and they just calmed me down. What made me mad was that right after all the adults started treating me better and it infuriated me. I know my fucking limits. The only reason I went was because I didn’t know it was going to be all height based obstacle courses. The reason I cringe though is because I am so embarrassed to have had a fucking panic attack over heights. My whole fucking class saw and I cringe because of it constantly."

I had to go to school in another country for a year. I knew language but not that well and was illiterate. My first quarter I had the highest scores because I googled everything. I never really understood the classes but google became my bestie. After that quarter things went downhill. I stopped caring and went into a very deep sadness. I used to call it depression but i don’t feel like I should be saying that if I was never properly diagnosed. I cried myself to sleep every night and would get around 3-4 hours of sleep each night. I would get sick so much, one time I even missed two weeks of school. I wasn’t taking care of myself and sometimes I would go a week and half without showering or leaving my room. My friends from where I used to love would call me every single day, the minute they got back from school and we would talk or just keep each other company. I am so damn thankful to them. For Christmas break we went back to our family where I used to live. I insisted i go see my old school and say hi to my classmates and teachers. I walked in and all the teachers started freaking out and hugged me. I immediately started tearing up. They took me to the classroom my classmates were in and they all huddled around me and hugged me. I instantly started sobbing. They teased me because I told them not to cry. I started crying because I was happy to see them, but for a while I started believing I was making them up in my head, that I was a lunatic and that I imagined them all. Before all of you think I was treated terribly by the people in my new school, I wasn’t. I just didn’t like change and this was a very big change."

AskReddit,esgmhqg,t1_esgldc3,1561957770.0,"Yeah a lot of the teachers helped me through a lot. Let’s see ooh this story features the teacher from the first story. I should give her a name. She’ll be called Taylor. Mrs.taylor was the head of a club that was a mix of engineering and science and was for kids that could take an extra workload. The club was to basically create a city and have it withstand a natural disaster with eco-friendly resources. Well I decided to join the club and I was the unofficial leader of my team (the club had two teams. By unofficial I mean no one knew what they were doing so I would boss them around ). I got very sick one week and missed 3 days of school. My asthma was terrible and my meds made me feel so weak to the point where I needed help getting out of bed. I decided to not take my meds because of it which made me feel really bad chest pains. I had a fever and I could not breathe and I’m not joking my mom was worried I might be having some sort of heart problems. I was almost taken to the hospital but begged my mom to not take me because I wanted to go to school. Mrs.Taylor didn’t believe I was sick and was emailing me about how I was irresponsible and I was just panicking and scared to go back to school. I finally went after 3 days. In those three days my close friends (same ones from the first story) were totally guilt tripping Mrs.Taylor telling her about how I was almost hospitalized. And like the first story she was nice to me after. I legit don’t know what I did to make her not like me that much, it might be because I would always tell her son that my friend wasn’t interested in him and to leave her alone (I mean I wasn’t lying). But like I don’t hate that teacher, she was pretty nice half the time"
AskReddit,esgkygt,t3_c7nybr,1561956247.0,"I never really experienced terrible teachers but I did have bad experiences with teachers. 
*We were going on a field trip that was the kind were you are in nature and try to find Hod with your classmates (I’m a private school kid). I was originally not gonna go but decided that I might regret it, oh how I regret it.  All of the things we were supposed to do was rock climb and heights stuff. We were never told about it and I am still fricken mad they never told us. I was telling myself I should do something but knew I would have a meltdown if I did.  All of the people that worked there kept giving me faces because I wasn’t trying anything and that made me furious, even one of the teachers that went. We finally got to our last challenge. The last challenge was the rock climbing/zip line. That was the only thing I wanted to do, but after seeing the first person doing it I knew it wasn’t for me. The people that worked there were giving me such shit about it. In the end I decided to try but i asked my classmates to not cheer since it freaked me out. They weren’t cheering but my asshole teacher was like “why aren’t you cheering, you have to support each other” . They started cheering and that freaked me out, I felt judged, scared, and I knew I felt pressured. It wasn’t my classmates, I just felt like I would let them down if they cheered. I started sobbing halfway and begging them to let me down. I full on had an anxiety attack. My friends were shooing everyone including the teachers away. I still get anxiety attack about that day, and what really grinds my gears is how nice the workers and teachers were being after it. Like we made you do something you knew you didn’t want to do and you didn’t like it so we are happy. One of the parents that went to chaperone (who never pressured me might I add) called me a badass for it. Some of you might say that maybe I just needed to push myself but trust me when I say that I know my limits, I do push myself but some things are just too nerve wrenching for me. 

*My school was preforming a play and it cost $30 to audition. No one in my class tried out (As in they wanted our money but no way that’s hella expensive). The teacher confronted us about it and we defended ourselves in a slightly rude but at the same time calm behavior. The teacher then started crying. I am still shocked that a teacher would cry because we didn’t want to participate in a play. In the end no one from my class participated but idk why she was composing because she had over 40 kids helping her with the play .

Edit:WAIT I TOTALLY FORGOT I HAD A TEACHER I ACTUALLY HATED! 

So the teacher I hated was my algebra teacher. She was one of the most stressful people I have ever met. I shall call her mrs.fractions. Mrs.Fractions was an elderly lady, she had been working at the school for Im guessing 40+ years. It was my first year and I was trying to hard to get her to like me. I wouldn’t be a kiss up I would just try to be good at math. Alas I suck at algebra (which I blame at the fact that I never took pre-algebra so i guessed for the first couple months and kinda understood the basics). Well I would always spend at least 3 hours a day working on my math homework, I would end up crying in the end because I didn’t get it. You might think I was being dramatic but she was scary as fuck. Whenever she would call on you to answer a question and you didn’t know the answer she would give you a look. The kind of look where you feel like you are stupid, not a disappointed look, but a “YOU ARE A FUCKINNG IMBECIL ARENT You”. She would call everyone up one by one while everyone did their homework to show hem the quiz/test we took the day before to see our score. If you got a bad grade she would make sure the whole class heard. She would always make fun of us if we made a mistake with simple addition. I might sound fuckingn crazy but the more she made fun of me the more prone to mistakes I was. I flunked algebra that year and have to retake it freshmen year. I’m just glad she is retiring and no one has to deal with that stress again,"

Christians attacking the community is wrong and is breaking so many rules in our faith. We are here to offer the community support and to show them that the church accepts them.

My classmates comes in behind her, very nonchalant. She then said this “have I ever compared anyone in this classroom to a terrorists?” We were all pretty shocked by the question and just shook our heads and tried not to make eye contact with her.
