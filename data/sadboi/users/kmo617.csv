Also, they are not telling others to do so, they simply said ‚Äúthis is what I do. It helps me.‚Äù Everyone makes their choices to get through the day and everyone needs some help with things sometimes!"

relationships,fbn88xw,t3_edxvdx,1576994050.0,"You say you take care of the kids and do all of the housework and cooking. Does your wife work outside the home? Do you? Do you get any time to yourself? It sounds like there is part of you that wants to be a parent, or else you wouldn't want any custody, right?

&#x200B;

How is your relationship with your wife throughout all of this? Have you communicated these struggles with her? 

&#x200B;

The only advice I have is that you have to communicate your needs with your parent before doing anything drastic. If you two can't reach any kind of compromise or arrangement or anything that lessens the burden for you for the time being, then divorce is always an option! But the truth that you're struggling with this is going to come out eventually, so you might as well see if there's any compromises you can reach, whether that's setting aside a night for yourself, by yourself out of the house once a week, or realigning some of the responsibilities in the household, etc."

There's nothing inherently wrong with sleeping with a lot of people, but there's a difference when you're popping out kids you can't be responsible for and are fucking with people's marriages and shit. That's beyond being slutty, that's being a shitty person imo"
