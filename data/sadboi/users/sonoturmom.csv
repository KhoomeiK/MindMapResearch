Seems like you have some more space that could be used for plants once the weeds are out of there. Pots are always an option too.

I've recently gotten into composting and with the amount of leaves and weeds your pulling I'd think you have enough to get a pile going. In the long run you'd get some decent mix for the existing soil. It will take several months to get the procrss,so maybe not ideal if you don't plan on being there for awhile.
