Being on my period definitely helped the insertion. My periods completely stopped after about 6 months or so. The insertion of my Kyleena was honestly much worse. I wasn't on a period (since I no longer get them) so it was much more painful, possibly one of the more painful things I've been through. It was like a very prolonged extreme pinching feeling when they inserted it. It's almost time for me to get a new one and I'm dreading it but its so worth it. The cramping was pretty bad afterwards too but since I haven't had a period in a very long time it could have been on par with period cramps. Regardless, i found it all to be worth it.
