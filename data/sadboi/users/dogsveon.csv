SuicideWatch,fejva9i,t1_fejnqmp,1579186662.0,Thank you. One of the other comments said to take advantage of the community if I get bored and talk to others which sounds like something I could do since in my case I’d be going willingly. Good to know that I can request a temporary visit. At this point I think just getting an evaluation from doctors would be really important since it’s so hard to gauge how poorly I’m feeling. I really appreciate the info
SuicideWatch,fejdbe3,t1_fej7qy4,1579168399.0,this was so informative and everything I could’ve asked for. Thank you so much. This makes the thought of going so much easier to think about and genuinely brings me some relief. I appreciate your input more than I can explain ♥️

mentalhealth,fej6lpo,t1_fej5cf6,1579159021.0,These were my exact worries too but my therapist told me that the medical records that the visit would be on isn’t something that colleges or job opportunities have access to. It might be something to consider for someone going into the military but that’s not something I see myself getting involved in. She also said insurance can it but that’s a case by case thing
mentalhealth,fej47ti,t1_fej3aso,1579156278.0,I have this preconceived notion that it’s not a comfortable place at all and can be very scary which has deterred me from going. was that the case for you?

I’ve had many  experiences with people who arent familiar with these issues attempt to “help” but only do so by making strong assumptions and being closed minded. It sounds like your sympathy has prevented you from assuming that approach, and I think that’s what will help her. Bringing her water and food when she doesn’t feel like getting it herself can be very important, speaking from experience, I know I would’ve really appreciated someone doing this for me, even if I didn’t end up eating. It’s a reminder that you care for her and want her to be okay, and by showing her you care with your actions, you are proving that. It gives me hope to see someone is so willing to try and empathize with that situation when they don’t have first hand experience. Please try to continue choosing to be there for her, it may get frustrating but these situations can be hard to fight alone, and she needs your patience."

So basically it happens when people are raised into a sexually repressed environment, like if someone grew up in a religious community where it is looked down upon to be doing anything sexual before marriage teaches the generations of women that it is taboo to talk about it. Essentially it happens when mothers who were shamed for one reason or another teach that same shame to their daughters. It’s a perfectly healthy thing but there are a lot of misconceptions."

Having your sister to reassure you of reality was such a lucky thing, and as absolutely cruel and awful that situation was, it’s relieving to know you had each other. I have a twin sister and I’ve had parts of my life where I believed it was truly a blessing and a curse — we’ve both been through a very emotionally unstable place because of that shared trauma, and since the beginning of it, having each other has forced us both to stick around. I am absolutely convinced that i would’ve killed myself long ago if I didn’t have a twin I needed to survive for."

raisedbynarcissists,f9m497f,t1_f9m0ut8,1575440991.0,"about the first half and your comment about hijacking my post- you didn’t, I promise. I posted this with the intention of being able to talk to the others in the community about it, and knowing that sharing my story has pushed those experiences (which were beyond screwed up—I am so so sorry you went through that) into a place in your head where you can start to express them fluently is something I am incredibly grateful to have been able to do for another person.  “I did the best I could with the tools I was given” is something that my dad has *definitely* said as well. I think it may possibly be a defense mechanism to prevent them from having to possibly face accountability for any of the things they did. Also, if you check my posts you can actually see that a couple hours ago I was literally just talking about having my abuser ask me to my face if I wanted him to leave not even a *month* ago, and I was *still* too scared to tell him that he should. Anyways I found r/raisedbynarcissists and r/CPTSD by sheer accident when I was scrolling through subreddits after making my account to find feedback on ear cartilage piercings and It’s sooo crazy how things turn out like that. I’m definitely trying to take advantage of having these resources now though, having an understanding of disorders that I couldn’t quite grasp before makes it so much easier to identify and defuse the blow when I’m trapped in a situation with him, plus, this community continues to blow my mind everyday with the resources they share like articles, videos, actual community support, and advice!!! You could definitely use this sub to sort through the pieces from the past, and it could be a good place for you to put your thoughts if you’re open to hearing similar stories :) thank you so much for sharing with me, I really wish you the best of luck continuing on your journey to heal from this."

NoStupidQuestions,f9m010t,t3_e5u8wx,1575436867.0,"In this society there is an underlying imbalance of power. Inherently and without much thought, it is taught from generation to generation the concept that men are more powerful than women will ever be. It’s shown in schools by the way health class shows a pair of tits but only a pair of bouncy balls, how women’s bodies rights have become politics, how women have been oppressed and denied for centuries in the past, etc. it is without a doubt something that is ingrained in the brain of many many people. Taking that into consideration, if you are constantly surrounded and influenced by the societal belief that you are inherently inferior, and that there are people who can and will remind you that they want to take advantage of you, it can be pretty fucking scary. hope this helps a little, I tried my best to explain it how I meant but I’m generally not that good at phrasing this concept"

raisedbynarcissists,f9lh42m,t3_e5qie2,1575422951.0,"one of the worst things, which I’ve only realized recently, is that my Ndad has *always* picked into entirely normal things that I’ve said and called them toxic and at the fault of someone who is close and supportive of me. 
For example:
ND: You just want to stay home from school because you don’t want to face your missed homework.
Me: no, that’s not why I want to stay home.
ND: what is it then?
Me: I have a throbbing headache, the room is spinning and my sinuses burn when I breathe. It hurts to swallow, I’ve been incredibly nauseous and-
ND: are you serious? God you sound like [my S/O]. Stop complaining!

I recently realized that it’s probably an intentional tactic to invalidate me when I’m right and he can’t fight it. It’s so isolating because it strips me of my feelings of safety when it comes to getting support. If I told my boyfriend that my dad thought A. I’m complaining by telling him my illness symptoms when HE ASKED  and B. that he thinks my SO has complaining as a prominent trait (which he DOESNT??? at all??? And telling him could make him nervous)—when my Ndad only says good things about him when he’s not pissed off?? So it could just be a lie all together??? It’s just so confusing. It makes it so hard to reach out to someone else when I need it because i can’t sort it out well enough on my own. 
essentially, he blames my friends for problems I don’t even have and it isolates me when I need support most. It’s one of the many tactics he has, but luckily I’ve finally recognized it. So that’s progress!"

sex,f9ldc4r,t3_e5qk48,1575420318.0,"^^ all the comments have good suggestions. I remember it took me a while to get more comfortable with that stuff, so if you’re currently doing absolutely nothing with your hands, some good starters to go off of are things like going from holding the back of his neck while you kiss to running your fingers through his hair, or tilting his chin to signal taking a break from the kiss to kiss his neck. Right behind/underneath the ear can be sensitive, so if you don’t know how he reacts to it, take some time to learn by using different techniques like soft/strong short/long kisses. 
My general rule of thumb is if I notice one of my arms isn’t doing anything, then there’s something it could be doing. Even if it’s taking a few seconds to feel his bicep, or put your arm around his neck. 
For me, actively touching your partner during a kiss makes it feel that much more passionate. Like anything else, once you get warmed up and past the anxiety it gets really fun and you can pay more attention to how he reacts to certain things:) EDIT: shit I missed the “guys of reddit” part 🤦‍♀️ I’m sorry I hope this can still be helpful"

Honestly, commenting helped me a lot too, I haven’t really expressed much of what had happened to anyone, so i know what you mean. It’s nice to let it out. That’s what this sub is for, after all! We’re all here for each other :) What you’re describing sounds sooo familiar, though. The boundary idea sounds like it could work as a coping skill, but I’ve never thought to say it to my Nparent. I’m not sure if that makes sense. Let me reiterate ahhh. I find myself shutting down in situations where my Nparent is acting manipulative. My therapist has suggested recognizing personally “when XYZ happens I feel ABC way and I'll do Thing in response.” That way, if you practice reminding yourself, you can recognize XYZ sooner and escape the situation before it escalates. I’m not sure if it’ll help you, because honestly when I tried it, it was when I’d try to tell my dad I needed space, and he’d end up coming to my room over and over to ask me questions or tell me things, so I’d continue to get overwhelmed but still feel too bad to tell him to go away because they were harmless things he was saying, but he was clearly not respecting my need. Anyways, I’m not sure if you can apply it to your situation, but I figured I’d share. It seems my situation has definitely de-escalated by talking to my therapist about what I can do to avoid it since it’s sooo hard to get through to an Nparent, but please don’t let what those medical professors say invalidate your struggles. Gaslighting and manipulation is a *real* and *awful* thing to experience."

raisedbynarcissists,f9l16bp,t3_e5o228,1575412108.0,"my mom once said to my Ndad that my siblings and I were too afraid to talk to him about our problems, but apparently he was having a really bad week involving his company and was at risk of losing years worth of work, so it he was already really on edge. when I got home, I hadn’t even taken my jacket off before he started scolding me about how I “never listen,” and how I don’t take the “advice” he gives me, targeted a bunch of my triggers by denying my effort to eat healthy and be active, told me that I wasn’t actually suicidal or depressed, and then snapped and said “If you don’t want me here then I might as well leave. Do you want me to leave?” Which, after manipulating me to shit, the only response I could handle spitting out was no. Looking back on it now, I know I should’ve said yes. Up until that point I was so afraid that him leaving the house would ruin my life, because he’s the money maker, my mom used to rely on him etc. but the next day my mom revealed a few things I didn’t know before. Apparently, later in the night she kept fighting him about how we definitely feel like we can’t talk to him, because he doesn’t listen and just tells us to do things his way. She just, causally dropped to me that he actually started to *pack a bag.* Which, I’m not sure if it’s the same for you, but with him, it is on an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT level than just *threatening* to do it. She also revealed to me, that she no longer feels reliant on him, and that she’s sick of him taking out his feelings on us. She told me that if he decided to leave, she’d be okay. Things ended up calming down within a couple of days, but I honestly think hearing her say that is the piece I needed to be able to tell him yes. I know that if she decided she’d be okay then I could forgive myself if I told him I didn’t want him around. Part of me wishes that I got the chance to say it. Things have been okay since then, and it was a couple weeks ago. The holidays are coming up though, and I have a feeling it’ll get bad again. I can’t say from this whether telling your Nparent you are scared of them is a good thing or not, because there were a lottttt of variables involved, and I didn’t say it directly to him, but whatever happened that week definitely changed the situation a little. Especially because of what my mom told me. I hope that if this is something you’re planning on doing, that it goes okay. You have so much strength. Remember that no matter what your Nparent says, your fear is valid, and it’s okay that you are scared of the way they act."

I don’t remember much context, I walked out on the back deck to see my mom talking to her friend, and after her friend noticed me she exclaimed “you’re so tan!” and proceeded to pull my swim bottoms down to look at the color difference. I have NO idea how that was okay at all but it wasn’t until years later that I could even look at her again"
