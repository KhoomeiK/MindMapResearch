Bringing her water and food when she doesn‚Äôt feel like getting it herself can be very important, speaking from experience, I know I would‚Äôve really appreciated someone doing this for me, even if I didn‚Äôt end up eating. It‚Äôs a reminder that you care for her and want her to be okay, and by showing her you care with your actions, you are proving that.

I think it may possibly be a defense mechanism to prevent them from having to possibly face accountability for any of the things they did. Also, if you check my posts you can actually see that a couple hours ago I was literally just talking about having my abuser ask me to my face if I wanted him to leave not even a *month* ago, and I was *still* too scared to tell him that he should.

raisedbynarcissists,f9lh42m,t3_e5qie2,1575422951.0,"one of the worst things, which I‚Äôve only realized recently, is that my Ndad has *always* picked into entirely normal things that I‚Äôve said and called them toxic and at the fault of someone who is close and supportive of me. 
For example:
ND: You just want to stay home from school because you don‚Äôt want to face your missed homework.
Me: no, that‚Äôs not why I want to stay home.
ND: what is it then?
Me: I have a throbbing headache, the room is spinning and my sinuses burn when I breathe. It hurts to swallow, I‚Äôve been incredibly nauseous and-
ND: are you serious? God you sound like [my S/O]. Stop complaining!

I recently realized that it‚Äôs probably an intentional tactic to invalidate me when I‚Äôm right and he can‚Äôt fight it. It‚Äôs so isolating because it strips me of my feelings of safety when it comes to getting support. If I told my boyfriend that my dad thought A. I‚Äôm complaining by telling him my illness symptoms when HE ASKED  and B. that he thinks my SO has complaining as a prominent trait (which he DOESNT??? at all??? And telling him could make him nervous)‚Äîwhen my Ndad only says good things about him when he‚Äôs not pissed off?? So it could just be a lie all together??? It‚Äôs just so confusing. It makes it so hard to reach out to someone else when I need it because i can‚Äôt sort it out well enough on my own. 
essentially, he blames my friends for problems I don‚Äôt even have and it isolates me when I need support most. It‚Äôs one of the many tactics he has, but luckily I‚Äôve finally recognized it. So that‚Äôs progress!"

I remember it took me a while to get more comfortable with that stuff, so if you‚Äôre currently doing absolutely nothing with your hands, some good starters to go off of are things like going from holding the back of his neck while you kiss to running your fingers through his hair, or tilting his chin to signal taking a break from the kiss to kiss his neck. Right behind/underneath the ear can be sensitive, so if you don‚Äôt know how he reacts to it, take some time to learn by using different techniques like soft/strong short/long kisses. 
My general rule of thumb is if I notice one of my arms isn‚Äôt doing anything, then there‚Äôs something it could be doing. Even if it‚Äôs taking a few seconds to feel his bicep, or put your arm around his neck. 
For me, actively touching your partner during a kiss makes it feel that much more passionate.

That‚Äôs what this sub is for, after all! We‚Äôre all here for each other :) What you‚Äôre describing sounds sooo familiar, though. The boundary idea sounds like it could work as a coping skill, but I‚Äôve never thought to say it to my Nparent. I‚Äôm not sure if that makes sense. Let me reiterate ahhh. I find myself shutting down in situations where my Nparent is acting manipulative. My therapist has suggested recognizing personally ‚Äúwhen XYZ happens I feel ABC way and I'll do Thing in response.‚Äù That way, if you practice reminding yourself, you can recognize XYZ sooner and escape the situation before it escalates. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôll help you, because honestly when I tried it, it was when I‚Äôd try to tell my dad I needed space, and he‚Äôd end up coming to my room over and over to ask me questions or tell me things, so I‚Äôd continue to get overwhelmed but still feel too bad to tell him to go away because they were harmless things he was saying, but he was clearly not respecting my need. Anyways, I‚Äôm not sure if you can apply it to your situation, but I figured I‚Äôd share. It seems my situation has definitely de-escalated by talking to my therapist about what I can do to avoid it since it‚Äôs sooo hard to get through to an Nparent, but please don‚Äôt let what those medical professors say invalidate your struggles. Gaslighting and manipulation is a *real* and *awful* thing to experience."

raisedbynarcissists,f9l16bp,t3_e5o228,1575412108.0,"my mom once said to my Ndad that my siblings and I were too afraid to talk to him about our problems, but apparently he was having a really bad week involving his company and was at risk of losing years worth of work, so it he was already really on edge. when I got home, I hadn‚Äôt even taken my jacket off before he started scolding me about how I ‚Äúnever listen,‚Äù and how I don‚Äôt take the ‚Äúadvice‚Äù he gives me, targeted a bunch of my triggers by denying my effort to eat healthy and be active, told me that I wasn‚Äôt actually suicidal or depressed, and then snapped and said ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want me here then I might as well leave. Do you want me to leave?‚Äù Which, after manipulating me to shit, the only response I could handle spitting out was no. Looking back on it now, I know I should‚Äôve said yes. Up until that point I was so afraid that him leaving the house would ruin my life, because he‚Äôs the money maker, my mom used to rely on him etc. but the next day my mom revealed a few things I didn‚Äôt know before. Apparently, later in the night she kept fighting him about how we definitely feel like we can‚Äôt talk to him, because he doesn‚Äôt listen and just tells us to do things his way. She just, causally dropped to me that he actually started to *pack a bag.* Which, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the same for you, but with him, it is on an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT level than just *threatening* to do it. She also revealed to me, that she no longer feels reliant on him, and that she‚Äôs sick of him taking out his feelings on us. She told me that if he decided to leave, she‚Äôd be okay. Things ended up calming down within a couple of days, but I honestly think hearing her say that is the piece I needed to be able to tell him yes. I know that if she decided she‚Äôd be okay then I could forgive myself if I told him I didn‚Äôt want him around. Part of me wishes that I got the chance to say it. Things have been okay since then, and it was a couple weeks ago. The holidays are coming up though, and I have a feeling it‚Äôll get bad again. I can‚Äôt say from this whether telling your Nparent you are scared of them is a good thing or not, because there were a lottttt of variables involved, and I didn‚Äôt say it directly to him, but whatever happened that week definitely changed the situation a little. Especially because of what my mom told me. I hope that if this is something you‚Äôre planning on doing, that it goes okay. You have so much strength. Remember that no matter what your Nparent says, your fear is valid, and it‚Äôs okay that you are scared of the way they act."

I don‚Äôt remember much context, I walked out on the back deck to see my mom talking to her friend, and after her friend noticed me she exclaimed ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so tan!‚Äù and proceeded to pull my swim bottoms down to look at the color difference. I have NO idea how that was okay at all but it wasn‚Äôt until years later that I could even look at her again"
