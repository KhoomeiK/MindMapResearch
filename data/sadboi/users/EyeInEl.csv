So, Heroin can be kicked cold-turkey in about 10 days. For me, it takes about 14 days until I feel 95% again. You're over the hump in about 5/6 days though. It's gonna hurt. But it'll be over fast.

Methadone is not 'worse' to kick - its easier, but it lasts longer (the withdrawals). Thats a good 3 weeks to a month. But its a good way to do it. Theres no reason why anyone shouldn't be off that Methadone in 21 days.
