Tell him that you want to have time for yourself in order to learn to love yourself and to improve the relationship and he is also encouraged to do it too. If you talk about it, you might not feel like you're being abandoned or feel like he feels he's being abandoned. That was a weird sentence so I hope you understand hahaha.  

So it's not really taking time outside the relationship but a mechanism to improve yourself and the relationship. If you're not so dependent of him, he will not feel like he is responsible for you and your feelings but that you are there for him too and that it's about both."

BPD,fkahrik,t1_fka7xti,1584008578.0,"I think that's the part that you have some responsibility. For example, finding coping skills, going to therapy, etc. Maybe your episodes will decrease. Also, learn ways to do things not for him but for yourself. Start with little things like having dates with yourself and that will also help your relationship. The thing is that if you just leave it up to him to be there for every time, he does might get tired. I was abandoned by a FP because of that so even if they have the genuine intention to help, it is emotionally draining and they don't deserve that."

Also, I wanted to say that although you already tried doing small things. Maybe don't look at it as many small things but literally plan to do just one thing. Nothing else. That may be easier to digest. And if you do it and still feeling like keep going then do another thing but if you don't, then don't feel bad about it."

BPD,fhlva0t,t3_f3vuqw,1581705142.0,"I don't know how to put it into simple words but there is a book called ""I hate you, don't leave me"" that pretty much the title says a lot. We may be mad at someone but we would hate then to abandon us. We do stuff that could make them walk away and then get really upset if they do leave. It's a love/hate relationship. And I think until she gets help and starts recognizing these kinds of behavior and control them better that it would get better.

I wish you two can figure things out because you seem like you do care a lot for her."
