Anxiety,ewv96mp,t3_cqc5yj,1565801387.0,"Search my profile, there is a post about panic attacks and how to deal with them. I'm sure it will be helpful"
Anxiety,ewu78xg,t3_cq633c,1565767542.0,"Yes, checkout my profile, there are some materials i wrote about that. Checkout the ""the key to recovery"""
Anxiety,ewu7650,t3_cq68cp,1565767435.0,"In my profile, there are three posts I have written about anxiety. Check them out, they could be helpful"
Anxiety,ewsly1i,t3_cpzagq,1565730267.0,"I look it this way: you wanted to yell and you yelled. You didn't hold your emotions. Instead you have let them out. So that's a good thing. You are probably feeling too much guilt now. Because the emotion that you let out was kinda of a bad one (maybe rage?). But in the end you let it all out. Nobody's hurt. And you should forgive yourself. You are only human after all,yeah?"
Anxiety,ewsiz1v,t3_cpyt6i,1565728545.0,"Hang in there, you can always walk outside for a minute or two. Keep thinking about your family and your close ones. They love you, even tho they may forget to remind you that sometimes, they do. It doesn't matter how you feel. This is just the effect of fear. You are having a meeting with your fear right now. Maybe you need to stop worrying how you feel and continue your work. I mean you felt that many times before... And you are still fine. So you will be fine again.. and the next time. It's just the fear playing trick to you. So just say to it: fuck you I'm not scared, i will continue to work despite the terrible feelings that i have right now. And fuck the bad thoughts too. They are just thoughts. You don't have to believe them. You don't deserve to suffer."
Anxiety,ews605t,t3_cpx2hy,1565720891.0,"Speaking to your superior about your problem is probably not a bad idea. There is a chance that backfires tho. But adjusting working schedule so you can feel more comfortable is really not the solution to the general problem. It may help you for a while, but as time goes on you will begin to see more clearly how anxiety is limiting your life, and that's not a pleasent thought believe me. It's actually a very worrying one. So you need to find the real answers,why you feel this way and what can you do to reverse it back to normal.

I have written 3 posts about anxiety and fear and how can one overcome all that. You just need to search my profile and you will find them. Give them a shot. It can be a life changer for you. Good luck."
Anxiety,ews53xi,t3_cpwwaw,1565720366.0,"Your problem is a real one. But you should not blame people who are not suffering because it's so hard for them to relate to whatever you are feeling. They have never felt remotely close, to how you feel basically almost every say ( if not every). I know it's frustrating the way you feel, but you always have a choice. You can try to explain what you feel, or you can just tell people that they cannot understand because they have never felt the same way. But getting angry because people can't understand anxiety and wishing they have it so that they would understand, is not the right choice either. I suggest you to start educating yourself on the problem, because really that is the only way you can come to an solution later on. If you search my profile I have some written some posts about anxiety and fear and what is the real way to overcome it. Hope I was helpful and good luck."
Anxiety,ewruo32,t3_cpubbr,1565714141.0,"It's normal to get those feelings from time to time. So no need to worry additionaly. Let me ask you tho,do you find yourself worrying about life most of the time? Overworrying about different subjects on your life can overwhelm your nerveous system and that's in the core problem with people who suffer from derealization."
Anxiety,ewrn60k,t1_ewrlwhu,1565709358.0,"Thank you. I think nobody deserves to feel this way.That's why I'm trying to write these posts. Nobody deserves to feel the instense symptoms of anxiety and fear. So please upvote this post, so it may reach to more people in need. God bless you all."
Anxiety,ewrkqg6,t3_cpfdb1,1565707772.0,"Hey guys, today I wrote a post on that particular subject: Panic Attacks. You can actually get rid of them for good.

Anxiety,ewql1dm,t1_ewq2dvf,1565669178.0,Yup I like your post. Anxiety is certainly not the enemy. It's the interpretation that we have for it that's problematic.
Anxiety,ewqkdkt,t1_ewq2yi6,1565668571.0,"This is a sort of therapy. It has a name and it's called exposure therapy. And it's the most powerful therapy of all, because guys, to overcome your fear you NEED to do the thing that you are scared of eventually. There is no way around that. I'm just trying to show you here that that can be done in a very slow and controlled and completely safe manner. Now, I'm not against medication at all. I have never used them but I'm sure that they have their application in the right moment and time. But whatever that is you are taking, you must be taking it in a complementary way to the exposure you are doing. You can't be expecting from a medicine of some sort to make your fear and troubles go away completely. That's why drugs and alcohol are so dangerous, because the user is taking them only because the feeling of ""escaping"" that they create. But that's only a feeling... You can't just escape the fear and avoid all it's effects. It's impossible. Fear is too big and you have to accept it, you must accept it. You must bow to it and show it the respect it needs. If you instead try to fight it, you will lose the battle. Every time. So overall I think that modern medication can be helpful although I never tried them, especially if you suffer severe form of depression. But one thing I'm sure is you don't need them 100%. Anyway, kind of a long reply to your comment. I may write a topic on the medication and therapists subject. Today I will write about panic attack and how you can get rid of them for good. Stay safe, guys!"

I recommend you to check a post i wrote yesterday it's called 'The key to recovery'. Sadly I'm not on my computer right now and can't provide you with the link to the post. But if you search The key to recovery in the past 48 hours posts you will find it, or maybe you can find it if you search my profile. In this post I try to explain how our nervous system works when it comes to fear and anxiety. And why does it happen to us. Tommorow I'll write a post about panic attacks and how you can get rid of them for good. But for now please search the post and give it a try. In order to solve the problems that you are having you need to first educate yourself about them. Because only then you can create a strategy on how to fix the actual problem. No matter how hard you try now to solve the thing it's actually getting worse. It sucks that it is that way, but it's the way it is. So please go ahead and search that post.

Anxiety,ewpfnef,t1_ewpf8xz,1565640157.0,Overthinking its completley normal for someone who is experiecing a lot of anxiety. That's why I suggested you to read the post that I wrote (The key to Recovery- link is in the first comment). You will then understand or atleast have an idea how our mind and nerveous system works. And if your nerveous system is sensetized (which probably is) you need to learn a way to desensitze it. I explainted how that can be done also. Tommorow I'll write a post about panic attacks and how you can get rid of them for good. It's actually possible.Good luck :)

The brain can't actually feel pain because it has no pain receptors in itself. It's just a headache. But really, you should start educating yourself about anxiety. It really is a treatable condition but you need to learn how does it work and why it happens.I wrote a post on that subject it's called [The key to Recovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/coy47f/the_key_to_recovery/) .

Try this: If you have like 15 minutes try to shut your mind up and let the anxiety do whatever it wants to do. Just be there with it and don't try to fight it. I know it will feel frightning but by doing that you are actually faceing your fear. And you will se how magically you will begin to calm. Just don't add thoughts that starts with ""oh my god"" and ""what if"" . It may feel worse at the beginning but trust me that is the only way to face the fear... and as a bonus when you get good at that you will be much much less anxious. Good luck and trust in your self.Also don't forget to tell us how to presentation went :P"

I'm happy to hear that this is helpful to you. I believe that we deserve the best in our [lives.](https://lives.You) You can truly cure yourself from the over exaggerated symptoms that you may be getting due to anxiety. You just need to apply the technique that I shared with you and you will see for youself.But don't stop researching.Check out Claire Weeks.There is nothing to worry about :). You have a wonderful life and this is just an obsticale.But thats just life,right? A lot of obstacles... but you will get through everything. My grandpa used to tell me ""You have the power deep in yourself. You just need to look for it"". That thought stuck with me all my life.And it has been very helpful."
Anxiety,ewmgbdg,t1_ewmenfz,1565550965.0,"""oh not it's coming"" Thats the ""Oh my god "" thought that I wrote about. Typically the situation gets worse by adding second fears just like you did today.

Anxiety,ewme924,t1_ewmdgec,1565549530.0,"Hey gymmama,

I know exactly what you mean. I've been through the exact same feelings countless times. To make them stop you need to perfect the floating technique i spoke about. The moment you stop getting so impressed by these symptoms, you will stop worrying about them. And your nervous system will begin to heal :) But don't run away from the fear,instead try to feel these feelings, it's like a practice for you. And when you master that approach with the right attitude the feelings will slowly begin to fade."

Anxiety,ewk73qw,t1_ewk6ndp,1565477439.0,Glad you find it useful.
Anxiety,ewjxams,t1_ewjg5bo,1565473395.0,"Hi hellosteven,

Yes there is solution but it's not the kind of solution that you expect to hear. See you cant run or hide from yourself and your thoughts. Yes you can try to distract yourself by playing games,watching something or listening to something or whatever. But because you know you do these stuff to only distract yourself from the ""anxiety"", you are not solving the problem. That's why the fear still persists and will persist untill you change your attitude. See you can't run from fear. I mean if you are scared of something the only way to overcome it is by doing it. That means having the courage to do the thing that you are scared of. And I'm not going to lie to you it will feel unpleasant. But by doing it despite all the terrifying fear that you feel, that's the only way to kinda show and teach your nervous system that there is nothing to be scared of and with enough practice of exposing yourself to the feared situation,the nervous system will finally begin ""cool"" down or desensitize. It will begin to understand that there is no real danger of the activity you are doing and it will stop producing these over exaggerated symptoms known as anxiety. So... Don't run from the anxiety when you feel it. Don't try to distract yourself. Be there with it. Without adding a second fear of ""what if"" and ""oh my god"".It sounds paradoxical but you don't need to do anything for it to go away. You just stay there with your courage and let time pass while you feel anxious. You kinda need to challenge the fear to do it's best. Yes i know from my own experiences that that's scary as fuck. That's why i said it feels like a paradox, you kinda go against your instincts. But that is what you need to do.You need to accept all the feelings you are experiencing and not fight them! Don't try to fight the symptoms... you can't fight the fear.You never could...And you never will. It is something beyond your conscious control. In a way you need to look the fear in it's eye and challenge it. By the way I'm assuming that you are aware that the symptoms of anxiety can't actually hurt you. All of them are completley normal and nothing can ever happen to you.That is really important to know and should always be like an anchor thought in your head. So... I don't like to call all that a technique of some sort,you just need to stop resisting basically and let your body experience the scary symptoms without you adding another fears on top of them like ""what if it gets so bad i lose control of it"" or something like that. And guess what's gonna happen? The nervous system will almost immediately stop producing anxious feelings. You can even use this approach when you have an intense panic attack. The key is to let things happen instead of trying to fight them like we usually try to do when we get into a paniced state. That's why it gets so terrible sometimes because we try to make it go away. But that's the wrong approach. By fighting it you make it produce more. Instead... Let go.Let it be what there is to be.

Kinda of a long read and i will stop here and i hope this to help you and everyone reading it. If you feel you want to ask me something go ahead.Always happy to share my thoughts and experiences."
