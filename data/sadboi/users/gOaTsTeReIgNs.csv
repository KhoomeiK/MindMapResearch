todayilearned,fl301lo,t1_fl2bh55,1584764593.0,"My half-sister had a similar obsession with her belly button as a child, enough so to cause uncomfortable irritation. So, my mother told her that if she played with it too much, it would open up/burst and everything would spill out.

Dark, I know.. But she quit playing with it. The best part, though, is that she full-on believed this until she was 32 & I brought it up.. Talk about having a good laugh."

Secondly, if the user has any sort of lockscreen protection whatsoever, said lockscreen first has to be bypassed before results will show at all."
AskReddit,f7r1ieu,t3_dxf5xh,1573973181.0,"I'm not entirely sure how much this counts, though I've certainly got others. However, for me, it was when my then-girlfriend got shot while at work. I'd been home from work for maybe an hour, started to worry as I hadn't heard from her. Next thing I know, there's a rapid banging on my door. It's my gf's coworker, she tells me that she's been shot.

For whatever reason, I went in to a strange panic, frantically rushing for a moment to make sure I had what I needed & that the doors were locked.. And at some point snapped out of it and said ""wtf am I doing. None of this matters. We have to GO NOW!"""

So (apparently) naturally, there were a lot of lies & negative views shared behind my back. It pained me so much for people I loved to have that kind of hatred and apathy towards me. Ever since that happened, I've always felt this way. There have been several occasions in which I've asked close friends if they harbored negative feelings toward me & it upset them."

AskReddit,f2vxvh1,t3_ddh8vm,1570458807.0,"When I 9 or 10, I took a nap on a futon in my room, midday. The next thing I recall is what I can only describe as the most terrifying demonic voice that I've ever heard speaking to me (I think maybe it was telling me to commit evil acts, but I've likely repressed most of it). All I remember is telling it no, to stop & go away. When I awoke, I was trembling & covered in sweat. But the voice still continued speaking to me for at least a good 90 seconds of consciousness. When the voice finally stopped, I experienced an intense feeling of relief & was able to calm down. It was very difficult for me to explain to my siblings/family. To this day, I find myself playing games like Layers of Fear & Hellblade in the dark w/headphones, chasing that adrenaline rush.. But nothing yet has been able to come close."

Still made them come outside w/me for confirmation, I was ready to investigate that shit (or rather die, prolly)."
