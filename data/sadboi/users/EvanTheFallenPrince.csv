They’re a socialist country that gags all free speech because they view everyone as a single identity. It’s stupid. It’s like individuals don’t exist. I’d rather live in fucking Siberia than China, at least there I wouldn’t get to see people eating bats and causing a goddamn pandemic. Is that racist?"

I started early Burning Crusade and it was much different. If you think these quests are like running errands, early WoW quests were running all over the damn place back and forth. Once you hit lvl 60 go level in Outland, that dynamic is still pretty much preserved there. Who knows, you might like the slower pace for those quests. Good luck."
