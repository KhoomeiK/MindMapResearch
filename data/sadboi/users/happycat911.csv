It's been a decade since I seen missionaries wander around. Lots of JW's, and I tell them the same thing as I told Mormons. Go fuck yourself. This doesn't bode well for Mormonism in Canada. Like any other cult they tend to stay focused in the Capital cities or larger cities. But the problem is, nobody outside of South Calgary-Alberta gives a shit. To them Mormons are a bunch of mutant inbred women with stupid ugly hairdoos. (ie Mole women) and ploytamist old fucks with beards. 

Mormonism in Southern Alberta is pretty much confinded to those mutant redneck hives of inbred mutants Cardston, or those FLDS (the ploygamist ones that child traffic) compounds in the Mountain, now cracked down by the RCMP.  Like just go up to one of these kids poke them in the forhead and see the soft boiled egg texture that's their skull cave in.

About 20 years ago in the 2000's when Hinckley was still alive and begining the great expansion outwards with temples, Immergrants and fellow Canadians flooded into Calgary. Causing a change in the demographic, we have huge mega churches of Ethopian-Rasta Christianity now for those Somalis, and Ethopians and Copics, we have more mosques and temples, we have more Evangelicals, and Korean churches, and we have more Atheists. 

In addition more people are moving into Lethbridge the last Mormon hold out in Southern Alberta. That's the Northern Tip of the Zion Curtain. This is weaking them.

I rather be making my peeps and animals and plants feel good."

Then ask her to come to the rational conclusion her young healthy mind comes up with..... Also provide her of the misdeeds the church through it's rather 2020 year old history of zealous mania... Especially against young girls like her, (the church was fond of ripping off the breasts of teenage girls, (100% true, their Iron spider implemement). Or even setting young teen girls on fire or hanging them... IF she's still intrested in the church after that. She has all the democratic right to believe in stupidity unfortunately. Child or not she IS a citizen of where ever you live. I'm presuming America."
