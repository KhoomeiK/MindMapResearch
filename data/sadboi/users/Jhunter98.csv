Anxiety,fhgfpac,t3_f31qmf,1581565935.0,As someone that struggles with this kind of thing a lot I can honestly say that you have achieved something really amazing. It‚Äôs still not gonna be easy from here on out but this is a massive step in the right direction. I‚Äôm really happy for you and I hope you keep up the great work :)
OKRABLEACH,fhapi5e,t3_f1ui6s,1581422371.0,Man I get a delay on Spotify between songs when I‚Äôm trying to make these things. Is there any particular setting I have to change for it to work? I‚Äôve got gapless playback turned on and still nothing.
Watches,fgv1btb,t3_f0m4ys,1581134381.0,"G‚Äôday r/watches, hope all of you moderators and redditors alike are having a great day. Before I got this watch I had never really owned a wrist watch before, or at least one that cost anything more than $20. My girlfriend and I were walking around Perth City and we passed a jewellery shop. I commented on how much I had always wanted a nice watch but never had the income to afford one. A couple of months later my 21st birthday rolled around and lo and behold, this wonderfully minimalistic Tommy watch was gifted to me. It‚Äôs one of the most meaningful presents I have ever received. The first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is put it on, and I think I‚Äôm going to keep doing that for many years to come!"

brockhampton,fb7wc0x,t1_fb7w5n4,1576600844.0,That‚Äôs the only thing that worries me but you‚Äôre exactly right if they addressed it theres potential for it to blow way out of proportion and spell the end of the group. Nervous times man...
brockhampton,fb7w4nv,t1_fb7vy44,1576600714.0,Yeah look I hate when mere allegations result in the end of a career so that‚Äôs probably what I‚Äôm gonna do. Just wanted to get a discussion going because with the state of cancel culture ATM I‚Äôm just kinda nervous for them.

OKRABLEACH,f8gyc87,t1_f8evnzt,1574566901.0,That works for Spotify but not Apple Music and the transition I have works on Apple Music perfectly but for whatever reason it pauses briefly on Spotify which ruins it. I am so frustrated hahahaha
OKRABLEACH,f8eg7i3,t3_e09vea,1574526985.0,Yo this is a dumb as fuck question but how the hell do u screen record and get the music to come through as well I have a dope transition but can‚Äôt figure out how to record it properly
