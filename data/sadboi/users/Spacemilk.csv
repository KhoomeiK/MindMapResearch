CallHerDaddy,fr4kxn1,t1_fr3r684,1589891073.0,"The Neiman comparison doesn‚Äôt really work because a sales associate doesn‚Äôt create what they are selling. Right or wrong the girls wanted a better percentage cut of their earnings (which have been extremely good for BSS) and they wanted the IP (can‚Äôt blame them). A percentage of earnings is a very standard way of contracting for media talent esp top tier talent (we can argue about this all we want but it is a fact they were the #1 pod at BSS which means they were top tier at BSS).

I don‚Äôt blame them for their motivation although their whining about being poor is just annoying and off-putting now that I know the truth. What I do fault them for is the shady and shitty behavior they used to negotiate (shopping the show while under contract, comparing their contract situation to Ke$ha‚Äôs). I honestly don‚Äôt even mind the Trail, it‚Äôs kept me engaged during this shitty quarantine so whatever ladies thanks for the manufactured drama I guess."

Yes it sounds like she saw dollar signs at first but it‚Äôs very possible she woke up to how shady and unprofessional she was being, and she actually learned from this whole thing.

Also IN FAIRNESS to Alex, her tough negotiating earned her an amazing offer from Dave. I don‚Äôt like the shady tactics she used (shopping to other places while under contract) but it worked and she got what she wanted and arguably what the pod was worth (and don‚Äôt get me started on their ‚Äúwehh I‚Äôm so poor‚Äù whining).

Milf Hunter would be a great add to the podcast if they used him to provide the guy POV on Alex‚Äôs theories and advice, and to check her on whether the advice would work or not. I would not want to listen if he had any part in giving advice, for one thing I don‚Äôt think he has anything useful to offer, for another the small sample of advice that he gave directly during that episode was so low quality, and last of all because I do noooot need another podcast about sex run by generic straight bro #483 which is how he came across on his episode."

Milf hunter‚Äôs advice was just plain not good, not useful advice. After hearing his episode I honestly think that Alex would sometimes ‚Äúbrand‚Äù her advice with his name to ‚Äúsell‚Äù it better, so the persona outgrew the real person. Or if she told a story, even if it didn‚Äôt come from him, she would attribute it to him.

Edit: and no you‚Äôre right your sex doesn‚Äôt matter :) I mostly asked because of that particular moment in the milf hunter episode I referenced above. He thought he was just blowing her brains out in bed because at one point she told him I need you to cum now, and he was like THAT IS THE HOTTEST THING EVER. Meanwhile straight women everywhere simultaneously cringed because it is a literal joke that the only reason you say that to a guy is because the sex is no longer satisfying and you just want to be done lol. And then she never called him again...ahhhahaha poor guy never realized.

Some of them think, hey, I‚Äôll be graduating with hundreds of thousands in debt anyway, what‚Äôs a little more credit card debt?

The time value of money rule goes both ways. Going into debt now, or skipping saving now, are both great ways to do the same thing: blow your money in the least efficient way possible at the worst possible time in your life."
AskMen,fr2kj7v,t1_fr252pa,1589838903.0,"It‚Äôs about the time value of money. Putting away $10 now at age 22 can make you more money than putting away $1000 at age 30 (numbers completely made up). So by age 30, if you‚Äôve saved and invested well, you could be well on your way to a $1M net worth (assuming LCOL area, good salary, and a little frugal living).

It‚Äôs also why people point out that, for example, an engineer can make more money than a doctor over the life of their careers - an engineer can pay off their bills and start saving in their early 20s, but med students spend years in school accruing large debts and don‚Äôt start earning til their late 20s/early 30s. And they don‚Äôt start earning serious money until even longer after that. Although they will probably have a much higher salary cap at the end of their career than the engineer did, on average the engineer will retire with more in their account - mainly because they started saving earlier (and not having the massive debt helps too!).

The lesson isn‚Äôt, don‚Äôt be a doctor - this example is just to illustrate the time value of money. Rather, if you‚Äôre going to be a doctor, start saving as early as possible, if you can, because your reduced earnings window could otherwise hamper your retirement savings."

StardewValley,fr1884a,t1_fr0rrsc,1589815094.0,"Lots of bombs, lots of staircases, some lucky food, healing potions/more food, make sure it‚Äôs on a lucky day, and use a desert warp to get there first thing. For the bombs, red are preferred since they have a larger explosion area and I believe a higher likelihood to open a stair/hole. Ideally you drop big bombs on crowded/big levels, and drop staircases on the levels where the entry is narrow or doesn‚Äôt have much you can blow up. You can reach level 100 before 5 pm easily on a lucky day. Then just pass out in the mines at 2 am to maximize farming, you will lose gold but not items if you pass out this way in skull cavern (you lose items if you pass out due to monsters FYI).

There are a couple ways to get the mats:

Buy: Start processing jade in crystallariums then buy staircases from the desert trader on Sundays in exchange for the jade. Buy bombs from the dwarf.

Craft: you‚Äôre gonna need a ton of stone since 1 staircase is 99 stone. And you‚Äôre going to want a ton of iron ore for the black bombs. Farming mats for red bombs seems a bit extreme here, I don‚Äôt think the trade off is worth it so I‚Äôd farm black bombs only. 

You can make health potions from mushroom forage, or just use food. I wouldn‚Äôt say lucky food is required, sometimes I use crab cakes instead, but I do expect to use more staircases on crab cake runs because of the lower luck."

Another option is using silicone based products. They don‚Äôt work as well, but they‚Äôll do. They can weigh down your hair and are the opposite of the curly girl method. Make sure to clarify your hair regularly to prevent buildup from the silicones. Dimethicone and its variants is an ingredient you should look for.

Somewhere in between are products like Olaplex, which I‚Äôve used and think is decent, or maybe salon treatments and deep conditioners and the like.

Good luck!"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fq63koq,t1_fq5t2uq,1589123774.0,"The thing is, the argument of full quarantine vs nothing at all is a false dichotomy. It‚Äôs not the only way to deal with a second wave. We should be putting in measures to test-trace-isolate. We should be working our asses off to create and distribute as much medical PPE to citizens as possible. We should be incentivizing companies who enable their workforce to work remotely, or companies who proactively find ways to reduce risk to their workers (installing plastic barriers, frequently sanitizing).

We should be looking at smart ways to flatten the curve. It‚Äôs not smart to make quarantine the only tool in your toolbox when you know a second wave is likely."

Some people even tint their brows at home using men‚Äôs beard die but I haven‚Äôt gotten brave enough to try it myself (yet)

Another option is microblading which is like tattooing on your brows. It‚Äôs expensive."

FarmsofStardewValley,fq4xo2o,t1_fq4sggl,1589086745.0,"It‚Äôs actually not too hard to farm winter seeds. It takes one season of doing it, going from a couple seeds to a full blown harvest. It sucks the first year, but after that you get enough that in subsequent years you just do some maintenance planting. 

You plant a full farms worth of winter seeds on the final few days of winter, then spring 1 you just have to scythe to have tilled watered ground. Pop coffee and you could have this baby done before 5. I lay down speed grow on day 2, if you do that kind of thing.

This is only really beneficial if you‚Äôre buying yourself an extra crop cycle so it depends what you are farming. I do ancient fruit so ensuring I can plant in a day gives me another harvest plus wiggle room if something goes wrong."

/u/Unable-Dimension dont let this person hold you back, suggest it to ConcernedApe on Twitter! I think it is a great idea. It would be a cool community improvement for your character to unlock at some point. It would help players empathize a bit I think. I love this game because the depth and storylines of the characters help me put myself in the shoes of others. This would be a great way to build on that."

SWGalaxyOfHeroes,fpw0cye,t3_gfjap2,1588955050.0,"-	Start on HT now. With that ship alone you can 3* all fleet battles even if everything else is hot trash. HT+geos=roll face on keyboard to beat fleet battles, under almost any commander.
-	Focus on Executrix first because finishing Tarkin‚Äôs challenge battles is extremely important. Tier 3 of his battle gets you 6 zeta mats a week. You will need 20 mats total to activate a character‚Äôs zeta ability.
-	Pair Executrix with geo ships for a fleet that will last you quite a long time until Chimaera is fully operational. Get yourself ranked high in fleet for access to even more zeta mats.
-	Beyond this, definitely ask the fleet discord or here, because your strategy might change depending on which teams you can/want to gear next. For example - if you are ages away from unlocking Han/Chewie and therefore Milf, there is no sense building a Rebels fleet around Home One. You will still need H1 and a couple Rebels (Phantom II, Ghost) to max Chimaera so don‚Äôt totally sleep on an H1 fleet."
