CallHerDaddy,fr4lmzf,t1_fr4liwp,1589891589.0,Erika even acknowledges it in her recent podcast. It certainly didn’t last long though lol.
CallHerDaddy,fr4kxn1,t1_fr3r684,1589891073.0,"The Neiman comparison doesn’t really work because a sales associate doesn’t create what they are selling. Right or wrong the girls wanted a better percentage cut of their earnings (which have been extremely good for BSS) and they wanted the IP (can’t blame them). A percentage of earnings is a very standard way of contracting for media talent esp top tier talent (we can argue about this all we want but it is a fact they were the #1 pod at BSS which means they were top tier at BSS).

I don’t blame them for their motivation although their whining about being poor is just annoying and off-putting now that I know the truth. What I do fault them for is the shady and shitty behavior they used to negotiate (shopping the show while under contract, comparing their contract situation to Ke$ha’s). I honestly don’t even mind the Trail, it’s kept me engaged during this shitty quarantine so whatever ladies thanks for the manufactured drama I guess."
CallHerDaddy,fr4kfrm,t1_fr3q6nz,1589890700.0,"I agree they both seem shady, but I’m willing to give Alex a small benefit of the doubt, long enough to hear her out if she wants to talk about it. Yes it sounds like she saw dollar signs at first but it’s very possible she woke up to how shady and unprofessional she was being, and she actually learned from this whole thing.

Also IN FAIRNESS to Alex, her tough negotiating earned her an amazing offer from Dave. I don’t like the shady tactics she used (shopping to other places while under contract) but it worked and she got what she wanted and arguably what the pod was worth (and don’t get me started on their “wehh I’m so poor” whining). Sofia was the one who wrecked what could have been an amazing deal for all sides."

Milf Hunter would be a great add to the podcast if they used him to provide the guy POV on Alex’s theories and advice, and to check her on whether the advice would work or not. I would not want to listen if he had any part in giving advice, for one thing I don’t think he has anything useful to offer, for another the small sample of advice that he gave directly during that episode was so low quality, and last of all because I do noooot need another podcast about sex run by generic straight bro #483 which is how he came across on his episode."
CallHerDaddy,fr2vaxt,t1_fr2ufcv,1589844585.0,"Oh yeah the advice the girls give is terrible long-term advice, I mean it’s great advice for fucking and fleecing your way through the entire single population of your city lol but that’s not “good” advice. Milf hunter’s advice was just plain not good, not useful advice. After hearing his episode I honestly think that Alex would sometimes “brand” her advice with his name to “sell” it better, so the persona outgrew the real person. Or if she told a story, even if it didn’t come from him, she would attribute it to him.

Edit: and no you’re right your sex doesn’t matter :) I mostly asked because of that particular moment in the milf hunter episode I referenced above. He thought he was just blowing her brains out in bed because at one point she told him I need you to cum now, and he was like THAT IS THE HOTTEST THING EVER. Meanwhile straight women everywhere simultaneously cringed because it is a literal joke that the only reason you say that to a guy is because the sex is no longer satisfying and you just want to be done lol. And then she never called him again...ahhhahaha poor guy never realized. So yeah, it was like a really sad in joke for straight women (or at least, straight women who have had bad sex 😂) that a lot of other groups may not get because they have not been blessed with sex with straight men bless their hearts 🙄"

AskMen,fr2pja6,t1_fr2nxpa,1589841458.0,"Good luck! Save your money. Don’t try to play keep-up with your classmates. Some of them come from money and can afford to go out and spend like crazy. Some of them think, hey, I’ll be graduating with hundreds of thousands in debt anyway, what’s a little more credit card debt?

The time value of money rule goes both ways. Going into debt now, or skipping saving now, are both great ways to do the same thing: blow your money in the least efficient way possible at the worst possible time in your life."
AskMen,fr2kj7v,t1_fr252pa,1589838903.0,"It’s about the time value of money. Putting away $10 now at age 22 can make you more money than putting away $1000 at age 30 (numbers completely made up). So by age 30, if you’ve saved and invested well, you could be well on your way to a $1M net worth (assuming LCOL area, good salary, and a little frugal living).

It’s also why people point out that, for example, an engineer can make more money than a doctor over the life of their careers - an engineer can pay off their bills and start saving in their early 20s, but med students spend years in school accruing large debts and don’t start earning til their late 20s/early 30s. And they don’t start earning serious money until even longer after that. Although they will probably have a much higher salary cap at the end of their career than the engineer did, on average the engineer will retire with more in their account - mainly because they started saving earlier (and not having the massive debt helps too!).

The lesson isn’t, don’t be a doctor - this example is just to illustrate the time value of money. Rather, if you’re going to be a doctor, start saving as early as possible, if you can, because your reduced earnings window could otherwise hamper your retirement savings."

I just don’t think newbies have as much access to the void essence/solar essences which is why I recommended using iron/coal for the big bombs. The idea should be - do whichever is achievable, they both work, but mega bombs will perform better. If you can’t do mega bombs, it is still worth trying with big bombs - esp if runs with big bombs give you materials to make mega bombs."
StardewValley,fr1884a,t1_fr0rrsc,1589815094.0,"Lots of bombs, lots of staircases, some lucky food, healing potions/more food, make sure it’s on a lucky day, and use a desert warp to get there first thing. For the bombs, red are preferred since they have a larger explosion area and I believe a higher likelihood to open a stair/hole. Ideally you drop big bombs on crowded/big levels, and drop staircases on the levels where the entry is narrow or doesn’t have much you can blow up. You can reach level 100 before 5 pm easily on a lucky day. Then just pass out in the mines at 2 am to maximize farming, you will lose gold but not items if you pass out this way in skull cavern (you lose items if you pass out due to monsters FYI).

There are a couple ways to get the mats:

Buy: Start processing jade in crystallariums then buy staircases from the desert trader on Sundays in exchange for the jade. Buy bombs from the dwarf.

Craft: you’re gonna need a ton of stone since 1 staircase is 99 stone. And you’re going to want a ton of iron ore for the black bombs. Farming mats for red bombs seems a bit extreme here, I don’t think the trade off is worth it so I’d farm black bombs only. 

You can make health potions from mushroom forage, or just use food. I wouldn’t say lucky food is required, sometimes I use crab cakes instead, but I do expect to use more staircases on crab cake runs because of the lower luck."

He then suggested it would be for the best if our generation were to wipe out the older generation. My face went 😐 and I extricated myself as fast as possible.

I did it once, I have to say it was amazing bc I could barely dry my hair after a shower and it would still be a no-frizz gorgeous look. But damn it was PRICY. That said it is one of the only ways to attain this look.

Another option is using silicone based products. They don’t work as well, but they’ll do. They can weigh down your hair and are the opposite of the curly girl method. Make sure to clarify your hair regularly to prevent buildup from the silicones. Dimethicone and its variants is an ingredient you should look for.

Somewhere in between are products like Olaplex, which I’ve used and think is decent, or maybe salon treatments and deep conditioners and the like.

SWGalaxyOfHeroes,fq5rc7x,t1_fq4ewv7,1589115316.0,"Honestly, fuck it CG should do it. Almost no one except the whaliest whales have Phoenix G12 much less relic’d. And that faction is a right bitch to gear, one of the worst in the game. If they made Phoenix meta or even A-tier, they would get so many people spending on that ugly gear crunch."
MakeupAddiction,fq5r328,t3_ggsf88,1589115109.0,"Have you ever gotten your brows tinted? I get my done at a local salon, it’s usually $10-15 and the results mean I can go 2-3 weeks without needing to fill in my brows. Some people even tint their brows at home using men’s beard die but I haven’t gotten brave enough to try it myself (yet)

Another option is microblading which is like tattooing on your brows. It’s expensive."

If we are as unprepared for the second wave, we must be some real fucking idiots. As a wise man once said, “fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again.”

Why the fuck are people genuinely arguing AGAINST being fooled again??"

FarmsofStardewValley,fq4xo2o,t1_fq4sggl,1589086745.0,"It’s actually not too hard to farm winter seeds. It takes one season of doing it, going from a couple seeds to a full blown harvest. It sucks the first year, but after that you get enough that in subsequent years you just do some maintenance planting. 

You plant a full farms worth of winter seeds on the final few days of winter, then spring 1 you just have to scythe to have tilled watered ground. Pop coffee and you could have this baby done before 5. I lay down speed grow on day 2, if you do that kind of thing.

This is only really beneficial if you’re buying yourself an extra crop cycle so it depends what you are farming. I do ancient fruit so ensuring I can plant in a day gives me another harvest plus wiggle room if something goes wrong."
StardewValley,fpy4df8,t1_fpxqs9i,1588995739.0,"Mate you are being awfully negative about a potential update to a game that regularly gets updates, and with a creator who has a known wholesome bent.

/u/Unable-Dimension dont let this person hold you back, suggest it to ConcernedApe on Twitter! I think it is a great idea. It would be a cool community improvement for your character to unlock at some point. It would help players empathize a bit I think. I love this game because the depth and storylines of the characters help me put myself in the shoes of others. This would be a great way to build on that."

If you have the rabbits foot in your inventory, they will instead play a friendly game of pool. Once you marry someone, you stay at 10 hearts with all the other marriage candidate.!<"
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,fpw0cye,t3_gfjap2,1588955050.0,"-	Start on HT now. With that ship alone you can 3* all fleet battles even if everything else is hot trash. HT+geos=roll face on keyboard to beat fleet battles, under almost any commander.
-	Focus on Executrix first because finishing Tarkin’s challenge battles is extremely important. Tier 3 of his battle gets you 6 zeta mats a week. You will need 20 mats total to activate a character’s zeta ability.
-	Pair Executrix with geo ships for a fleet that will last you quite a long time until Chimaera is fully operational. Get yourself ranked high in fleet for access to even more zeta mats.
-	Beyond this, definitely ask the fleet discord or here, because your strategy might change depending on which teams you can/want to gear next. For example - if you are ages away from unlocking Han/Chewie and therefore Milf, there is no sense building a Rebels fleet around Home One. You will still need H1 and a couple Rebels (Phantom II, Ghost) to max Chimaera so don’t totally sleep on an H1 fleet."

I hope to god they put them there because I’m rapidly running out of nodes I’d bother farming in fleet. Once I finish out the Resistance ships I’m basically done and will probably spend all my fleet energy farming Mk4 Zaltins.

Getting real sick of just being a Facebook/Reddit warrior. Not to say that shit isn’t valuable, it’s just that I see it as “Lowest reasonable expectation” to be a good human, you ought to at least stand up for people in conversation and try to change hearts and minds where you can.
