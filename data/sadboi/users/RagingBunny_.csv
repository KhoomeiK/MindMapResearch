I'd also recommend life drawing, there are plenty of references/exercises (like time limit) on the internet but I personally prefer actually being out and drawing 🙂 it is different for everyone, the best advice that I can give you in regards to motivation is to not compare yourself to others, but rather compare your work from last month to now for example. Take your own time with things and remember to have fun 😁"

Surrounded yourself with people who are willing to understand. I like to think people do the best they can with what they have"
