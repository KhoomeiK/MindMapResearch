SuicideWatch,foqxc6g,t1_foqw8bq,1588002473.0,"Thank you for your kind words, but honestly, seeing the only person I trust walk away from me due to misunderstandings and my dumb issues, and living in an abusive household since the last 19 years, let alone in a lockdown, is not helping. It's a prison, and I cannot get out of it. It's been 13 years, and there hasn't been a single day I haven't cried. I work my ass off, in work, to do better, for my mental health, but I've seen 0 progress."

BPD,fj2udgf,t3_fb2065,1582954305.0,"I feel you. It's the same with me and my best friend, and he told me a few days ago about how everything about me just seems sad and nothing ever makes me happy. I know it sounds harsh but I kinda get it, it's been 5 years since he has been helping me regularly with my issues. I'm trying my best to get out of this hellhole but it keeps getting worse somehow. I know the kind of efforts I'm putting in towards getting better but it always has the opposite effect. I hate it."
BPD,fibp1rt,t3_f7dula,1582326804.0,"I totally understand what you feel, going through something very, very similar. You took the words straight out of my mind. Let's talk if you wish? We need to support each other through this. Don't hesitate to talk"
SuicideWatch,fdgcbsv,t3_el73tb,1578389834.0,"I really feel what you feel. My best friends talked me out of an attempt a few days ago and I really, really appreciate that they did, but it's just getting harder and harder by each passing minute. I know everyone will just blame themselves if I kill myself, and I am too much of a scaredy cat to do it anyway. I don't want pain, or surviving an attempt. I just wish every day, and every night, that something just happens to me. I pray to every god there might exist, to take me in my sleep so that nobody blames themselves and knows they couldn't have done anything. It would be a natural death. I really just want it to happen now, because every passing day I encounter, it's getting harder to breath, harder to see, harder to get out of bed and harder to exist. I feel bad I cannot keep my promise of trying to my loving friends, but I did try my best, and it is not working anymore. 

I guess we need to hold on, I really don't know if I am qualified to say this being in the same condition, but I guess it is what we need to do. Hit me up if you wish?"

There seems to be no balance, which is so important."

Just try to regulate your breathing, and think of all the moments that made you feel calm/happy/content. Put on a podcast, and just close your eyes to give them some rest. It'll be okay soon.♥️"

depression,eqd6ula,t3_bxz0iw,1559984635.0,"I used to get down on myself a lot, and by that I mean, all the time. I still do to some extent, but I'm trying my hardest to not let small things affect me anymore, and rather learn from them. Negative reactions and your loved ones looking down on you for minute mistakes doesn't help either. But I've started embracing it and trying to get better at both minimising my mistakes, and acknowledging the fact that I am human, I'm not supposed to be perfect. Once I realise I've made a mistake or I forgot something important, rather than focusing on why I made the mistake and getting stuck in the moment, I try to find the most viable solution to the problem that I can employ. It helps me not spiral, and also I actively engage in something other than the problem itself. And once I do something about it, the sense of accomplishment actually calms me down. Of course there's a long way to go, but it's a start."
BPD,eq9l7ql,t3_bxqnf3,1559910755.0,"Happens to me all the time. I forget why I entered a room, which everyone does at times. But in my case, it happens multiple times a day. I find myself repeating something to someone multiple times because I keep forgetting they already know. My academic performance too suffered to some extent, because of this. It's pretty legit. I usually forget things in short term though, I clearly remember things that happened a long time ago, say a few years. Maybe things that happened before I started experiencing memory issues. Now I try to keep a journal on my phone, so that I can jot down things which I cannot afford to forget, like dates, venues, etc."
