bipolar2,fnyqul0,t1_fnx9k1s,1587372213.0,I was on 200mg but I experienced the suicidal thoughts all through being titrages up. I was switched over to amisulpride in the end with vortioxetine. They seem to be working okay and the suicidal thoughts have certainly stopped in the most part. Hope this helps.
bipolar2,fnvt4vi,t3_g41y01,1587304018.0,I had this on lamotrigine. I am off it now. It‚Äôs quite a well known side effect apparently although I didn‚Äôt find anything about it in my meds leaflet. Speak to your doc ASAP for sure. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this it really sucks.

bipolar2,f3mctu0,t3_dhcjsd,1570986420.0,I had this when I was on ssri‚Äôs (sertraline and fluoxetine were two I was trialled on) and it‚Äôs stopped since I was put on different meds for my disorder (Aripiprazole and lamotrigine rather than lamotrigine and ssri). Made my life hell for over two years. Glad you got yours sorted I know how hideous it is.

bipolar2,f2mwk6t,t1_f2mb39m,1570309347.0,Thank you. I will talk to them tomorrow I think after hopefully a decent ish sleep. Talking has always been an issue for me so it is hard but you make a really valid point. Sending all the good vibes your way too x

That being said- being in the throes of this disorder, all rational thought often slides right out the window. The likelihood is she‚Äôs both pretty horrid but also very ill. I wish you both the best."
bipolar2,f1m7poe,t3_d9xb0u,1569586927.0,Historical Friday hypo event- got so irritated by a phone call I got at work- I get super angry/irritable when I‚Äôm hypo And really wanted to leave on time to start my weekend. I put the phone down after the call and told colleagues ‚ÄòI‚Äôll rip her head off and sh*t down her neck if she calls again today‚Äô. Cue stunned silence.

bipolar2,f19es03,t3_d88am7,1569271511.0,He sounds like he‚Äôs gaslighting you. You deserve better. If he‚Äôs using your illness as a stick to beat you with he isn‚Äôt the one.

She‚Äôs not your child, your fianc√© sounds like he was railroaded into the decision and you have exposed the child to what sounds like a somewhat sexualised content account (by your admission) for likes. Listen to the mother and grandmother. Creepy men commenting on your pics is your choice but not a 6 year old kid.  God only knows who is fetishising that picture. She isn‚Äôt a commodity for you to engender more likes on a social media account."

It‚Äôs brutal and I feel your pain ...My doctor has started me aripiprazole im addition to previously being on fluoxetine and lamotrigine, as this is what research is best for bipolar depression. I‚Äôm still in hospital for it, and have only been on these for a few days so can‚Äôt really say if it‚Äôs working but having read a few research studies it seems to be true.   I sure hope it does because this sucks I hope you get the right balance of meds you need :)"
