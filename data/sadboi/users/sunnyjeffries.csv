BPDsupport,fpy2553,t1_fpx8uvw,1588994367.0,"This is an interesting thought. I can see why I would avoid honesty to make someone happy or satisfied, but I like the idea of standing my ground for my own sake. I mean, all I get from being silent and appeasing is a feeling of resentment which starts that passive aggressiveness you mentioned. Nice insight. This is why I love reddit lol. I appreciate it."
BPDsupport,fpwrrbc,t1_fpwn0dx,1588968775.0,"I think the hospital implemented some DBT stuff, but I haven’t been to a group that’s labeled as DBT. I’ll look into it though bc the therapy I’ve tried is pretty much just talking and trying to get “stable”. It’s more of a soothing technique instead of a problem solving technique they like to use because, obviously, I feel better when there’s people just being soft and easy lol. Though, that hasn’t gotten me as far as I had hoped. It’s just made me comfy. I really appreciate the help. I think I’ll try doing some more baking (I didn’t even know I could till this quarantine lmao). It takes all my focus and makes me feel good. Idk why I can’t think of stuff to do when I’m struggling lol this was very helpful. Thank you."
BPDsupport,fpwmv46,t1_fpw8myh,1588966247.0,"Now that I think about it, I don’t have many boundaries. One might be how I let people know when I’m in a deep study mode so they’re not a distraction, but that’s really it. I struggle keeping up with boundaries because my self control is pretty weak. I get lost in a “what if” game and do what I told myself not to do or just ignore boundaries. I wanna change, but I don’t really know where to start. This might sound dumb, but how does one know where or when to set boundaries? Thanks :)"
BPDsupport,fpvem6c,t1_fpuhqgb,1588943036.0,"I appreciate your reply. I think I need reassurance, you know? I have a LOT of judgments about my emotions. I feel like my emotions are stupid, weak, and whiny (I realized this is mostly because of my fear of abandonment or disappointment. I don’t want to be a pain.). Growing up, if you cried you were a baby and if you got mad you were “too sensitive”. I feel like I’m broken. I feel like there’s something wrong with me. I can say my emotions are valid, but I don’t believe it. In my mind, I must be different because “no one” reacts like this except children who don’t know any better. Is any of this normal?"
Pets,fobch52,t1_fo9rs4i,1587658409.0,"Thank you for your replies :,) It really helped me out. It’s been hard to think about the future because everything is so intense right now, but I have hope I get better. I appreciate it."
Pets,fo38m7y,t1_fo2xz38,1587482572.0,"I understand. Maybe I worded it bad. I’m not getting a kitten anymore lol. I was upset and irrational when I considered getting it. A lot of people on here knocked sense into me, though, which helped me get back up so thanks for the help ! I appreciate the feedback."
Pets,fo37tes,t1_fo1sz9a,1587482154.0,Yeah I wasn’t in the right head space yesterday (I haven’t been in the “right headspace” for months lmao). I probably should’ve taken this to talktherapy because it’s really more of an emotional background lol. I felt this on a different level though. Pets are the most amazing things to me and I was emotional then saw a rescue kitten and fell down a hole. I appreciate your reply a lot so thank you!
Pets,fo36kvh,t1_fo2ffit,1587481498.0,"To be honest, I posted this last night when I was emotional. I know that’s a bad idea but I needed some reason knocked into me. I’m not getting the kitten. Not to get deep, but after I inherited my biological mom’s money I’ve been really stupid and it’s been the worst year of my life. I haven’t bought anything expensive, but spending is how I cope. I know this is very bad (especially bc of the way I got it) so I go to therapy and I’m getting wayyyy better. This is a hiccup of bad habits so I’m glad someone told me the truth. Thank you for the help! :)"
Pets,fo1r3kx,t1_fo1pwg9,1587439533.0,Yeah you’re right. I’ve given up on it. I just really want a pet that I can play with and love bc my dog is tired and old. I’ve done a lot of research on therapeutic pets and thought this was it lol. It’s selfish to adopt a kitten for my enjoyment and I understand that. You can’t win em all haha.. :/
Pets,fo1i3k2,t1_fo1brkv,1587433774.0,"but I can’t do it all without him knowing :(.  What do I do for the prep? Like, deliveries and building cat furniture? How do I meet the kitten without him tracking my location? Yes, he’s THAT dad. “As long as you’re under my house you’ll follow my rules!” type of dude. :/"
Pets,fo1hg33,t1_fo1eo9o,1587433365.0,"Money is no issue I can definitely cover it. I’m not “rich”, but I have a big advantage with have plenty of money to spare- $100, to $25,000 is comfortable to spend on a pet. I see ur point, though.. I just don’t see my dog doing anything to harm a kitten. He’s old now and laid back. Maybe when he was younger he might’ve but he’s changed over the years. This is 100% a valid point- I wouldn’t want anything to happen to the kitten even if the chances are low. One solution I see is the foster can give a 2-week trial run and if it’s not a good fit, you can return it to the foster. Maybe that would work? :/"
Dogtraining,fnmn0hm,t1_fnlygqf,1587074380.0,I’ll look into it. I think the harder part is convincing my parents this isn’t nothing and we should do something tbh.. Thanks!

My parents have a bad habit of giving in to his begging- I’ll talk to them and they will hopefully change. I texted my dad asking if he has hip dysplasia, but I probably won’t get an answer until later tonight. If he does, does this change anything?"

TalkTherapy,flss07n,t1_flmn6l4,1585449343.0,"Damn now I’m thinking.. I haven’t talked to any trauma specialists at all. I’ve always disregarded the questions about trauma because when I think of trauma I only think of physical trauma. Also regarding the Male BPD, I can relate to about everything on there. I normalize it as just being defensive. It’s gotten way better, though. I’m completely aware of what I’m doing when I hurt people with my words, but that doesn’t stop me- if anything it encourages me. I think I’ll actually look into that.. I think the specialist would really help to be honest. Thank you for the feedback !"

Aquariums,fl1sklx,t3_flyd5m,1584735420.0,"agree.. i’d rather have a more encouraging attitude when getting criticized. I’m new to this hobby, and i don’t really have as much money as others to spend on my fish so my conditions aren’t the best (don’t get me wrong they’re good and healthy!). It’s more discouraging than educational when I see harsh criticism- I understand the good intentions, but sometimes it makes me think “well, I should give them back to the fish store.. i’m not giving them the best life possible.” but all my fish are livebearers- my fish store doesn’t even give you credit because they reproduce so fast, so the chances of them going to a better home are pretty low. i think my attitude is good i’m not like a parent buying a 1g bowl for a full grown goldfish for a 5 y/o (which isn’t all parents ofc just an example). idk anyways yeah lol rant over .. 😅 ps - my fish are in a heated filtered cycled 20 gal"
