I went to the neurologist and he told me to chill down or I would have to start having meds and for whatever reason that worked after I had like the worst migraine ever. 

Didn't have another attack till I was 20 or so and then they were different, still tension ones but with aura, not always coming with pain but always with an upset stomach and a slowing in my speech and thoughts. They suck but I read them as a way my body has to tell me that I'm going too fast and need to calm down. 

I know that this doesn't work the same for everyone and the triggers vary a lot, but maybe it's worthy to look for a different approach to it besides meds, for it's likely to stay with us for life.

Y ese artículo habla de la ley en China y las dificultades que están teniendo para su implantación efectiva. Esto es relevante porque es uno de los campos donde la opacidad del sistema chino puede verse más claramente y donde sigue teniendo problemas a nivel internacional en temas de inversión, robo de patentes, propiedad intelectual y demás. 

Cualquier cosa a la que puedas echar el guante que explique como ha cambiado todo desde que Xi Jinping llegó al poder también te ayudará a entender la deriva que está tomando China ahora (más autoritaria, mayor recorte en libertades, exhacerbación del nacionalismo...) y es relevante para entender la narrativa oficial que está siguiendo el país. Hay que comprender que se encuentran en una encrucijada, ya que es desde allí desde donde el virus se extendio al resto del mundo y la opacidad con que trataron la por entonces epidemia fue un factor decisivo en la actual expansión del SARS CoV-2. Por otra parte, están intentando liderar la ayuda internacional y la cooperación contra la pandemia ante el hueco dejado por EEUU, además de dar una imagen de competencia y rapidez a la hora de gestionar el virus a nivel doméstico cuando en un momento inicial no fue así. Y quieren que la imagen de eficacia y cooperación sea la que prevalezca. En China es fácil, porque los medios están completamente intervenidos, pero fuera nos huele raro y no compramos la narrativa oficial del PCCh tan fácilmente.

En ese artículo se explica esto último y habla sobre la narrativa que se ha extendido en ciertos medios de que los gobiernos autoritarios pueden hacer frente mejor a la pandemia que las democracias (y tranquilo, el nombre de la página no tiene nada que ver con el partido español, de hecho tiran bastante a izquierdas). 

Los artículos que he puesto más arriba están detrás de un paywall, pero si eres alumno universitario no deberías tener gran problema para conseguirlos y si no tampoco es muy difícil hacerse con ellos. A poco que busques en Think-tanks no directamente bajo influencia del PCCh, una idea común es la de falta de transparencia. Y cuanto más de cerca toque la la estabilidad del partido, menor será esta. Algo importante es recordar que en un sistema como el nuestro hay mecanismos de control del poder (que funcionen ya es otra historia) y que el poder de la censura es limitado, por el tema de tener libertad de expresión. En China esto es algo que ni se pretende. Es decir, los medios están completamente intervenidos, el rodillo de la censura, y ahora más con Xi, está campando a sus anchas y el ambiente se está endureciendo en cuanto a libertades. 

Ahora, aunque no haya muchos estudios todavía sobre la validez de los datos aportados por China en esta crisis, cosas como el hecho de que sistemáticamente mientan en sus datos sobre el PIB (  [https://www.wsj.com/articles/lies-damned-lies-and-chinese-growth-11563185210](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lies-damned-lies-and-chinese-growth-11563185210) ) hacen que la comunidad internacional esté recibiendo al menos con escepticismo los datos oficiales del Partido.

I feel like is something I had to learn to do from scrap. I'm a super slow reader, but still I can manage to go through it. Always carry a notebook with me so when I'm reading more dense stuff I can take notes or put pieces of paper with notes in the book (for I hate to write or underline them).

Another thing I use is intuition. Authors usually give you enough clues to follow the plot in fiction, so even if I miss some words or a couple of pages, I generally can go back to the story without rereading them. If something is important enough, I'll know it, but small details... even descriptions are a mess. Sometimes I have to take notes, other times I can read a whole series without knowing how a character looks and is ok. I can read again or look it later in the wiki, or here in reddit.

And there's no need to remember or understand every small detail of it. The things that you have to understand will come to you eventually, just enjoy the ride."
