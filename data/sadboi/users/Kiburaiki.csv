zoloft,fqu3xrh,t3_gksa78,1589651551.0,"It's kind of different for everyone. For me I experienced lack of appetite, nausea, indigestion, insomnia, fatigue, intense anxiety, and shakes. But most of that went away after a couple of days. The lack of appetite, nausea, and indigestion sometimes comes back for me, but it's not as bad. If indigestion gets you then I recommend eating healthy stuff or foods that aren't greasy."
zoloft,fqu2ooi,t1_fqsyqly,1589650860.0,"That makes sense. I start upping my dosage to 75 today, so hopefully that fixes it."
zoloft,fqu2kug,t1_fqs83kl,1589650800.0,So we're in the same boat. I really hope a higher dosage helps you out too
zoloft,fqs4ofh,t3_gkh8co,1589598446.0,"I'm on 50mg Sertraline (75 soon) and since it's finals week I've been having coffee nonstop. I haven't had any issues with it, before I took my meds coffee actually made me kinda anxious and now it doesn't. If anything I think it makes me a bit sleepy now."
zoloft,fqs47u9,t1_fqry9m1,1589598147.0,"Oh wow, that's relieving to hear. My doc was actually going to up it to 100mg but I didn't want to double it since it's so much. I hope 75mg works out for me"
zoloft,fnxhl9k,t1_fnxev3q,1587338789.0,That's really reassuring to hear. I can't wait to feel some improvement with my anxiety. Thank you again :)
zoloft,fnxdoft,t1_fnxd4c6,1587336522.0,I haven't thought of that. If the side effects are still getting to be by a week or so then I'll talk to my doctor about lowering my dose. Thank you!
Anxiety,fl39vgb,t3_flvow6,1584774325.0,Absolutely. Very recently (Like starting 2 days ago) I've started to throw up because of it. It's putting me off from eating which is probably making things worse. Oops.
AskReddit,fl38anj,t1_fl341ci,1584772510.0,Same here :c
pokemon,f6rhbq0,t3_dsrdls,1573104032.0,"I love these so much, please keep going! I think you should try randomizing it so you keep us all on our toes."
TumblrInAction,f6r99vt,t1_f6r7mg3,1573097023.0,"Looking further into it, it seems the pear is definitely a dogwhistle for MAPs/NOMAPs (Pear stands for ""Pro Expression, Anti Repression). I hope she's either unaware or just being satirical"
TumblrInAction,f6r0x5s,t3_dslvfi,1573090941.0,wait hold the fuck up she has a pear in her name. Correct me if im wrong but iirc that means the person is a MAP of some kind. Disgusting if true.
AskReddit,ewu6zns,t1_ewtk763,1565767192.0,"Urgh, that's what finally made me separate myself entirely from the fandom."
pokemon,esarsdf,t3_c6rrxg,1561766944.0,I was planning on doing this. I refuse to spend $60 on a half-assed game.
discordapp,eqtvhuz,t1_eqttgog,1560320382.0,Definitely not.
pokemon,eq219t2,t3_bwwe7d,1559725399.0,"Giant pokemon sound kind of... ehhh. I guess it depends on how they execute it. A giant Tyranitar/Tyrantrum/etc., would be pretty cool though. Not sure about raid battles though."
AskReddit,ep2wvdw,t1_ep24xvb,1559013864.0,Holy shit that's exactly what happened to me when I was about 16. I ate an entire bag. I regretted it the following days after.
pokemon,eohv5b2,t3_brttri,1558597588.0,holy shit. literally 2 of my most favorite things combined? this is amazing.
