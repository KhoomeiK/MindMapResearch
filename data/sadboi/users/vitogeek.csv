gatesopencomeonin,eo9doix,t1_eo9aouk,1558388882.0,"We didn't end on bad terms and they became practically mine because she gave them to me during the relationship. We lived together for 3 years. I have lots of things she got for me, for us and the things that were her's but became mine and she has things from me that were for her, for us and things that were mine but became her's. They do remind me of her but it would be unreasonable to get rid of all those things and I still do appreciate the relationship and her even though it's over. I personally don't understand the concept of getting rid of everything that reminds you of your ex. They were a part of your life, you can't just act like that part doesn't exist anymore. I believe one should learn from it and cherish it. It's part of your life, it's what made you who you are today. Why would you wanna erase it?"
