Persona5,ffnrdri,t3_etr4uo,1580069740.0,"Wait people aren't actually pissed off at this are they? Okay a couple of points here to make a lot of you look like idiots.

1. A fetish does not make you a creep. For instance, people can be turned on by incest porn, but not want to fuck their own sister. Furries don't often want to fuck animals. And PLENTY of people like porn that involves cheating or rape, but would NEVER do those. Just so, loli fans aren't just a bunch of pedos (though statistically maybe a few probably are, but you could say that about any fetish). For instance, I'm a loli fan myself, but I have an 8 year old daughter who regularly brings friends over, and not ONCE have I seen a single one of them in a sexual light. I'm attracted to the cute designs and innocent attitudes of lolis, that doesn't mean I'm gonna go fuck children, that's fucking disgusting. Not to mention, yes a loli can be legal, it's the design, NOT the age that makes a loli.

2. Anime style video games, and games from Japan always have the ""cute"" option when picking love interests. Usually some young, innocent girl with a shy attitude. And yes, I'm well aware Futaba kinda falls in that category too, but she can also fall under the ""geeky girl"" concept, which is also typically a separate option from the ""cute"" one. And since the twins are explained multiple times to be much older, that really does just make them cute, and nothing more. It's a very normal thing for a game like this to make them dateable.

3. THEY'RE FUCKING VIRTUAL. At the end of the day, if my first two points didn't make you feel stupid, this one should. If you can't accept that people can have a fetish without becoming a creep, or that these are normal, long time tropes in Japanese games, then at least accept the fact that there's no point attacking people for wanting VIRTUAL CHARACTERS to be dateable. After all, who the hell is that hurting? Sure as hell not any kids, that's for sure. So why even bother getting pissy? What, cuz YOU don't wanna date em? Then don't! Simple as that!"
