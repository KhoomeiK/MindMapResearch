Watercolor,fqtnwmb,t3_gjkrd1,1589642648.0,"I think your sand is really yellow. Something I had a really hard time with when I first started painting was making colors out of what I had. For example, if I’m looking for a deep, dark blue, I’m going to add orange to my blue. Only a tad. It gives a grey hue and darkens things up, without making the pigment too bright, which could happen if i just added more blue to my water. 

For the sand, I would try a yellow ochre or a gold based yellow. Add a brighter yellow for the areas that you’d want to highlight.

Additionally, remember that a large part of watercolor is learning how to play with the natural transparency of the colors. Try laying down one very transparent shade of yellow first, and the. Adding the highlights and lowlights in layers based on opacity."

Montessori,fm631dy,t3_ftbcf5,1585785219.0,"I would find real life examples of it and use those (I.e. one doesn’t need to share their work cubicle, one doesn’t need to share their favorite dress, one doesn’t need to share their gift card). 

I believe we share in adulthood, but not in the ways society teaches children to. When I am at work and am using the microwave and there is someone next to me in line to use it, it is natural to either wait until I am done, or for me to offer it when I am done. They aren’t going to stop the microwave and open it when my food is currently in there. The ways children are taught to share is unnatural for functional adult life.

Forcing a child to share, interrupts their natural method and rhythm of play, particularly when they are growing and developing play skills. Also, sharing is something than can be developed naturally as we appropriately age and are taught other functional skills (I.e. asking for something when someone is done, asking to borrow something someone is not currently using but has in their space). 

I also believe there are appropriate ways to foster sharing, such as offering toys to people around when we are done using a toy, setting down utensils we do not need to hold the entire time, such as a glue stick. Not forcibly teaching sharing also fosters an opportunity to develop waiting skills, functional communication (that toy looks really nice - when you’re done, could I use it?), and also bodily autonomy (saying thanks for asking but no, you can’t use it, I’d like to keep using it)."

I keep clothes that make me feel comfortable but are still appropriate for the environment I’m working in - sweatshirts, cotton tshirts, comfortable jeans. I never go crazy so it doesn’t over flow and keep it to a few basic items usually found at thrift stores. 

When I tried to include my work clothes into my standard wardrobe, it was taking half the amount of space I had available, which I didn’t find fair to take away from my “normal” clothes.
