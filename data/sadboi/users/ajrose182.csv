I would feel slight anxiety with due dates for work etc, but for the most part I just felt bland nothingness. 

Once I started dating someone, all my emotions came flooding back in. Anxiety (he won't love me and he will leave), depression (work was unstable), intense fear that anything nice in my life would end. I'm not sure which was better or worse, the emotionless numb feeling, or falling in love again and living in fear. He eventually did leave me because my fear and subsequent anger and pushing away was so bad, and now I just feel raw and broken. As much as I didn't enjoy the emotionless phase, I would take it over the pain I am in now."

I realized at 25 that I was an alcoholic, but didn't do anything about it for 5 years because I was dating another alcoholic at the time. 

For what it's worth, I often struggle with the ""I'm too old for this shit"" judgments about my own behaviours (which are self harming, although mostly emotionally and not physically anymore). I am trying to let all of my judgments go and just be. 

For me, I think my sobriety and faith are closely related, although I didn't see it until now. From 10 to 17 I was very in tune with nature, fascinated by witchcraft and pagan rituals and even things like old churches. I started drinking at 18 and I lost ALL sense of self after that. I didn't find that again until this year, at 32. It's sad, really. But I'm trying not to be sad about it and just be grateful that I have my sobriety and understanding now."
witchcraft,exmj611,t1_exmio0y,1566432956.0,"Oh I'm the same! I'm 20 months right now. :) 

I spent my first year of sobriety alone and isolating. I ended up finding a really wonderful community in a queer AA meeting near my home. It's very diverse, many are agnostic and we all have different concepts of a higher power. People often gift crystals for people's sobriety birthdays, which I think is really nice. But I am lucky, I live in a big city with a lot of left leaning folk and a big queer population, so it was not hard for me to find people outside the big book yelling Christian god types. 

Witchcraft and rituals are becoming a big part of my sobriety too. I pray, I meditate a LOT, I'm using my tarot cards more, I am getting more in tune with myself, and I'm feeling a lot more peaceful. When I first rediscovered my interest in witchcraft, a higher power and tarot, I kept pulling the 8 of swords. So I got her tattooed on me and I hold on to that tightly.

BorderlinePDisorder,ewqjkxv,t3_cpgnpv,1565667865.0,"Is she seeing a therapist at all right now? Is she off all medication? 

I would highly recommend she seek out a DBT program or therapist who can help her. It helped me a lot. If you can afford it, some couples therapy that is trauma informed and understanding of BPD might help too. You can both learn communication skills together. I would recommend that she have her own therapist first, and that the couple's therapist be a different person. 

I personally am not on medication right now - I tried a lot of antidepressants and none of them made me feel less depressed or any better, plus I got that ""zombie"" feeling and I slept 12 hours a day. 

But there are other medications that can help people with BPD. It doesn't just have to be antidepressants, if she didn't like those. For some people, a hormonal imbalance can exacerbate it, so certain birth control pills can help. There are also mood stabilizers that help some people. Everyone is unique but if she's open to trying something again, then it's worth looking into alternatives."

One thing I've realized as I get older though is that I'm really afraid to ask people to hang out. Sometimes people really like me and they ask me to hang out enough times that I get comfortable and then start asking them too. But with new people, I always wait to be asked, while having a quiet anxiety panic that they don't like me. I don't know if these people like you or dislike you. I do know that sometimes my BPD/anxiety makes me assume people dislike me when that isn't really true. 

Could you try asking them to hang out? Do a small gesture like bringing a snack you know people like, or asking them to grab lunch or something. I once made a friend at work because I noticed she really liked cheese popcorn so I would bring some on my way back from lunch on Fridays. 

Also, loud people can be really fun and awesome to hang out with. I have a lot of loud friends and I love them. But the ones I prefer are people who can be loud and still listen. Make sure when you're hanging out that you are being true to yourself (laugh loud, make loud jokes, be vibrant and genuine) but still also take the time to listen to what they're saying."

Is the problem that you see he has been online, but he's still not responding? Or has he just not been online and hasn't seen it yet? For me, I get very anxious when I see my boyfriend has been online but just isn't opening or responding to my messages. 

Either way, I would suggest talking to him about it, but remain very calm. You are just expressing that you struggle with anxiety, not demanding he respond faster or accusing him of making you anxious. You do have to be understanding of things like work, or him being out with friends/family. But if he's kind and patient, you can tell him that you struggle with anxiety. He might not even know, and he's just not responding quickly because he's busy and he doesn't realize it's making you anxious."

My dad left me and my sister (early 30s now) when we were 9 and 11. He had a new woman he was cheating with. They eventually had a kid when I was 13, and she brought her son (then 5) from a past relationship. I tried to be ""mature"" and come over sometimes but my stepmom hated me and my sister and made it very clear. My dad didn't really care, he had no interest in being a parent and was fine just taking my sister and I for dinner now and then. Eventually when I was in my early 20s I just cut them off. I was sick of my stepmom talking shit about me to my face and my dad just watching. My siblings were in their teens and we basically had no relationship because they were so much younger. 

Now, I'm in my early 30s and they're 20 and 25. I started messaging them in a group chat on insta with my other sister and it's actually been fun to get to know them. We have done games nights and gone for lunch etc. I don't blame them for what happened, they were little kids and their mom loves them and it isn't their fault our dad is a cheater and their mom was mean to my sister and I. I just woke up one day and realized that one day our parents will be gone. This is my sister, and step-brother. I wanted to know them as people regardless of the past.
