BPD,fr3wix6,t1_fr3sv2r,1589868277.0,">Please dont think that therapists can help you or be supportive.

I'm sorry but thats an incredibly toxic train of thought. I have had my fair share of awful therapists, but without the good ones I have found I would not be where I am today. If your therapist is a bad fit for you and your psychiatrist shames you for trying to find a new one, that's not your fault. Please look for medical professionals that will advocate for your best interests.

I will clarify the point I was trying to make since you seem to ha e misunderstood. I meant that often times without an official diagnosis a medical professional, of any kind, may question your judgment on your own symptoms to the point where it wastes time in finding an appropriate treatment, especially if you have already been evaluated before by someone else. That has been my experience. That obviously doesn't include the nuance of some doctors just being prejudiced assholes or simply being a bad match."

I can agree with some of the criticism on the nose, I think that it flattens into the face a little bit too much but can be fixed with some minor tweaks in value, or maybe making the point shorter and the nostrils a bit wider so it doesnt look so much like we are directly looking up at her nose from below.

Being reasonably skeptical is one thing, but acting like any progress toward a vaccine is pointless is absolutely daft. Something is objectively better than nothing in this case. The world will not be plagued forever. Humanity might be in a rough spot for a long time, things will be hard and sacrifices will need to be made, but eventually things will get better. A vaccine will likely be produced. And if not there are treatments being developed that will severely dampen the major dangers of this disease.

BPD,fq1hfkv,t3_ggeroa,1589045685.0,"I think it's important to recognize that empathy is a spectrum, and that bpd isnt what makes you an empathetic person. Often the constant emotional turmoil i struggle with makes it hard to see beyond myself, and thats probably fairly common. I know many nt people when under stress arent able to care much about other peoples problems.That said i dont believe that makes someone unempathetic in general.

I also disagree that if someone is empathetic they shouldnt label themselves as such. It's fine imo to want to call attention to a positive attribute of yourself, especially when you're constantly faced with both internal and some external peceptions that you are a bad person because of your disorder. 

I think calling yourself an empath is another thing altogether, I don't think people actually know what it means. Being an empath isn't just feeling empathy, it's the ability to completely comprehend and feel the mental and emotional state of another individual. In many ways it's basically mind reading. We can't mind read. We assume what other people are thinking and feeling and often times its inaccurate, so labelling this behaviour as being an empath is incorrect and I would agree is completely unhelpful to recovery."
BPD,fq1dpnc,t1_fq12tp3,1589044723.0,"I think their point was bpd isnt what will make you an empathetic person, albeit they worded it in a pretty cold way. Ie you can be an empathetic person and have bpd, rather than bpd is what makes you an empathetic person. 

A lot of people with bpd will struggle with empathy, many won't. This disorder affects different people in different ways."

I don't think ghosting is always an act of disrespect, and if youre in an abusive or toxic situation you absolutely don't own the other party an explanation, as your needs are more important than their feelings. 

Obviously we have no idea what op's situation was like so theres no way to say if that was the nature of the relationship. That said, I believe in the situation where youre breaking up with someone or ending a friendship, you do owe the other person enough respect to at least offer a curt explanation.  (Obviously assuming the relationship wasnt toxic or malicious). 

Thats just my opinion. I understand your stance on the topic is different from mine and thats fine."

BPD,fpz5dx5,t1_fpysv4f,1589013819.0,"I think it's super important to ascribe things like empathy to the person rather than the disorder.

Coronavirus,fpz1lfg,t1_fpyztnc,1589011880.0,"Wearing a mask is fine, wearing an N-95 is another thing altogether.

 N-95 masks are only marginally more effective at protecting you from harmful particles than a standard surgical mask if they arent fitted properly. If they are fitted properly, they are only  effective as N-95 masks for 20 minutes of wear before the moisture buildup from breathing breaks the seal around your face. Furthermore, they are always worn with protective eyewear in a medical setting since the particles they filter can also infect you through your eyes. Masks should be worn to help slow the spread of disease, rather than self protection. A medical mask will reduce your risk of being infected but it's main benefit is reducing what you as a wearer spread. 

An N-95 worn incorrectly both induces a false sense of security and is a wasted medical resource.

I know they seen like they're all directed at people in a serious crisis, but the reality is that they're there for anyone who's struggling and are there to give you suport.

The only thing this would change husbandry wise is that humidity doesnt need to be quite as high. Keeping it around 60-70% would be fine.

Regardless, I would reccommend a vet visit especially if that foot is concerning you."
bluetongueskinks,fii9yfu,t3_f7wv9w,1582418991.0,"Hi. Your merauke needs humidity of about 70-90%. You can measure this if you buy a digital hygrometer off of amazon. Humidity not being high enough can cause eyes issues, reapiratory infections and shed issues. Shed issues can lead to toes falling off, which it looks like your skink has lost a few. Another possible cause for the crusty eye could be a vitamin A deficiency, or potentially related to a respiratory infection. Please take your skink to a reptile/exotics vet for more a specific diagnosis and treatment plan.  Respiratory infections require antibiotics, and a foot that is turning green is concerning, and probably not something you can treat at home. 

In the mean time make sure your husbandry is good. Make sure humidity is 70-90%, substrate should be moist but not soaking wet.  Also make sure your skink has a basking spot of 95-110 degrees Fahrenheit."
