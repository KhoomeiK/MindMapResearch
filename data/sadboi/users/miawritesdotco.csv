Miscarriage,fguh271,t3_f0b6oq,1581120618.0,"Sorry to say this but I think the first support folder that you received is just ridiculous. In my case, I only had the internet to research stuff because doctors barely told me anything. So I can see where you're coming from. The uncertainty in this situation, miscarriage in general, can be so unnerving.

Heck, I even had this one doctor who wanted a repeated ultrasound to ""confirm"" (I already knew it after exiting the ultrasound room. No heartbeat, development too slow compared to last scan)

When I showed the scan to another doctor, she told me right away that things didn't look right. A second scan shouldn't be necessary.

I don't know why they're doing that, but I guess it's to protect our feelings and sanity? But they're doing it in a kind of a shitty way.

OP, sorry about your loss and I really hope you figure out your next steps clearly, with all the support that you need. What we're going through is painful, they don't need to make it much harder."
BipolarReddit,fgufhnm,t3_f0dn0k,1581119521.0,"Hey there! Hope you're doing great.

Well, in my experience, I experienced the same thing, *when* I was stable. I thought, ""Meh, maybe the doctors just misdiagnosed me or maybe this bipolar thing is not even real at all.""

I'm completely ok! Look I'm even feeling good without the meds!

Then you lose your ""balance"" and find yourself at the end of your wits. Life has become a mess again. And that's when you feel sick and reach out to a doctor, ready to pop whatever pill just so you prevent yourself from killing yourself or something.

I've been diagnosed twice, by two doctors. First time was five years ago. It's been quite a ride.

I'm relatively stable right now (stopped abusing substances, pursuing toxic people, living life ""on the edge"", seeking cheap thrills, cutting myself, planning my suicide) and still have my little bipolar quirks and all.

For me, what's worked was knowing my triggers and making sure I have a good support network. After some time you realize what tends to set you off and throw you off balance - in a major way.

Of course, the shifts are always still there. Like starting multiple projects at a time, abusing caffeine (ok maybe I haven't fully moved on from substance abuse lol) hypersexuality, impulsivity, anxiety, too much positivity.

The you crash with low energy, abandoned projects, plans for the future, feeling too desperate to function as normal, trashing the house. Once I didn't clean my apartment for 2 months.

Long story short, it's always there. If you look closely you'll see, or maybe you need a second pair of eyes. But just because it doesn't cause you to crash severely, does not mean it's not there.

The experience is different for everyone because we have different lives, hope you figure out a way that works for you.

As someone who does a lot and uses many apps every day, I'm ready to buy an app that will make things easier for me. But I'm hesitant because....

&#x200B;

* Trello does it for me, and it's free - so why do I need to pay for this? Why is this better? Why is it worth paying for?
* There are so many other productivity apps that I've seen with similar positioning. It's gonna take you more to wow me

I want to see some more of the ""deeper benefit"" in your copy.

What specific problems does it solve for me? We all know that getting organized is cool. But what's really in it for me? 

Plus - what's going to make me choose this over all the other productivity apps I see every single day?

I want to see something more, something different than what others put out there.

Like maybe you can highlight a clean interface for lesser visual clutter? (And reduce your mental effort?) Do you have an AI that sets automatic reminders so we can just sit back and let it do its magic? (Let's you be productive and lazy at the same time?) What other features do you have that beats any other app in the market?

I want to see something more in there, something that will make me take my credit card and say, here's my money - I can't live without this.

Otherwise, you have great design, you have an amazing product based on features, but as a buyer I want you to remove all my hesitations and show me that I can't live without this, or my life will be 20x better with it.

Your About page can be made more interesting by giving us an inside look at your company. Show us some pics, like others suggested, and give us a personal feel to your brand.

Try to use ""we"" instead of ""they"" so it sounds more personal

Write like you're talking to the customer, okay?

Also, I love how you're going for this comic, cool, youthful vibe, but your copy sounds like you could be just any other restaurant.

Checking your merchandise shop, this website would work better as a t-shirt merch shop because you have nicer pictures/mockups for the shirts

Love the product packaging on the landing page, but I want to see some actual food - more more more food, being served, eaten etc

Check out Google's digital marketing course. It is really expansive and gives you the basics on each type of digital marketing. It contains actionable tips, plus I loved their quizzes.

And if you looked at the wider picture, the course is a marketing campaign for paid search lol but it's still good!"

I also went off meds and it hasn't been perfect, but as long as I recognize my triggers and stay away from them I'm generally good. Dark place thoughts still come once in a while. Also got into physical activities - like surfing and enjoying nature.

For me it's been all about building a comfort zone. Mine isn't perfect yet and sometimes I still throw a fit and cry for no reason lol. I'll start journalling again, thanks for the reminder.

Also, I smiled at the you have a brain part"
