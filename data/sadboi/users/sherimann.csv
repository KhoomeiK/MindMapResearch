Swingers,f3v4a0v,t1_f3uqx4v,1571171432.0,I have to agree so damn true... that‚Äôs what makes it hard lol
Swingers,f3u2dnf,t1_f3u0h1k,1571151459.0,"Yeah we have been trying some nudesist resorts down here and other things, it‚Äôs just be difficult. We are dying we mr more or less dying to play with another girl. A unicorn we had she might not be as clean as we think so we don‚Äôt want to risk it, she‚Äôs been to a very sketchy part of town that we don‚Äôt trust.  Thank you for the tips ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Swingers,f3tzz9v,t3_di7iyz,1571150000.0,"Congrats I can honestly say I‚Äôm jealous lol.... but where have you found your most success in finding these playmates new and my SO are having a hard time find a girl let alone another couple to play with. And since we live in Florida you would think it be easy but it‚Äôs honestly not.  We belong of course to kik, mewe, SDC, but are still having the hardest time trying to find a girl let alone another couple?"
therapy,f3tnvyk,t3_di58aw,1571141187.0,"I was the same I got in trouble one time and my punishment was sentences, I hated writing. And now I feel the same like it‚Äôs a bad thing, and my mom says the same things ‚Äúrules are meant to be broken,‚Äù if they were meant to be broken why didn‚Äôt you say that and try to make me break them when I was younger. I hear my SO stories and he broke all of them and never got in trouble. I feel this on so many levels I thought I was the only one in the world. I feel like it‚Äôs made us fall in love with rules and so we try to break the rules then we realize ahhh, not worth it. And it also created our structure as a human being. But isn‚Äôt that what life tells us, rules and structure are suppose to be in our lives? And since we set  said rules that them we have to follow them?"
Swingers,f36vuyv,t1_f36lu4q,1570718258.0,"We have been to Cali and yes they do have all kinds of people, all are welcomed. We like to look at the some of the skinny women due to because their boob jobs are really nice lol. We went to their sinners and saints party. We are a more fluffy couple but the experience was wonderful and there were people more around our size and everyone super friendly. The only complaint I have is when I wasn‚Äôt wearing a top and walked into the ‚Äúlobby‚Äù the stares were more of how could you not have a top on, but I chalk it up to it was more of theme night, and you could tell most of the people at night weren‚Äôt use to a nudist resort. But also check out paradise in Tampa they have some theme nights to and are pretty nice and clean to, they are about five miles down the road from Cali. As for secrets it‚Äôs just expensive in my opinion but still all pretty clean as well."

BorderlinePDisorder,f31ny9i,t3_df7j4g,1570580249.0,"Trust me I know how you feel. I pray everyday for something to happen to take me away, it would be just easier on my family, they don‚Äôt like seeing me like that and it‚Äôs hard for me to hear oh you never use to be like this before. Trust me your not alone out there I hate correction loath pretending everything is okay. I would love to say the cliche things but I know that just irritates you probably more. But I know exactly where your coming from."
relationships,f31nj4j,t1_f31lytt,1570579944.0,I agree I wouldn‚Äôt want to move to a complete different state with out that commitment and it seems that what I might be stressing about the most. But then again it is harder for people out of state to get jobs in which ever state they are planning to go. But I appreciate the advise and great points.
relationships,f31bxqu,t1_f317qbg,1570571902.0,"Thank you I appreciate the long response and taking the time to read the my whole post. Really I do.

You have a valid point, time and financials are kind of a big thing for us right now. I have put him through a lot internally and stuff I didn‚Äôt mention but he‚Äôs still here so that is something I have to focus on.

As for the job it‚Äôs just something your right, it‚Äôs just he hasn‚Äôt put in much and the particular job he applied for I feel like he has a friend there that will help push through  and I think it‚Äôs something that your right he might not tell me till something happens. 

He has told me previously if the right jobs falls then we will have a longer talk and for me to come with.

I guess I‚Äôm really just trying to rush things."
BorderlinePDisorder,f30nlu1,t3_defiza,1570558339.0,"I feel like this all the time, with my current relationship. I see and track on FB and then start getting angry or upset/worrisome that he doesn‚Äôt write me or text me. He says that I‚Äôm his best friend why won‚Äôt you text me. It‚Äôs actually nice to know some one has the same going on. I love the idea of love and life be a fairy tail, I blame my harsh love on disney for this problem lol. But everything will be going fine and we are having a great time but then switch, I automatically think he‚Äôs not happy or he wants out. Especially when he talks about his past with me. Especially his endeavors before me and there were tons, I mean his number in the 200‚Äôs so much so he doesn‚Äôt remember. But I will sit for about two days and stew and then just blow up and get angry. When all I wanted was for him to share his past with me."
