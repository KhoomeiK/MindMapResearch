I send you well wishes and great internal strength to make it through the hour. The day. Or even just this next minute. 

Don't do it. Please.  Don't do it. I promise it's not the relief you're wanting. What you're looking for is internal peace. And externally destroying yourself won't bring it. You'll repeat the cycle. Overcome. This is the lesson. This is the point. This is the test. This is the meaning of life. To overcome. To fight. To live. 

The world is turning dark. Life is about to become a bit more difficult. But the cycle of life continues. Dawn is coming. Look for the break of light. Don't stop searching the horizon for it. It's black now, but not for forever. 

Stay strong. This isn't the end. It's just right now. Everything that has happened so far in your life is a result of your past life. Everything from now on is created and lived by the new you. The real you. 

Who are you going to be? 

Take life on and make it exactly what you want. It's going to be hard. But that's the challenge. Every life is a struggle. Don't make your next life extra hard. Work through the lesson. Work on internal peace. Your external world will fall into place. Take meds if you need to balance out chemicals in your brain. Sleep well, eat right, exercise, talk with people. Even if it's just through here on reddit with those who are offering their time and kindness. 

You are important. You are here for a reason. Don't let that important reason for living not come to fruition. Whether it's an invention you're going to make, or a life you'll save, or maybe a life you'll help create... You have meaning. You have reason. You may not see it now. But that's because you are in the dark place. 

Look for the light. Wait for the light. It's coming. Hunker down, love yourself, be kind to yourself, be patient with yourself. 

Don't make this the end. The end isn't blissful and pleasant. It's scary and full of regret.  It's not how we are supposed to go.  Dont create that experience for yourself.  It won't bring you the peace you may be seeking. That's not it. I promise you, that's not it. 

Don't give up. Not today. Okay. Please. 
From one warrior to another, never stop fighting to thrive in life. We aren't meant to merely survive. You are meant for greatness. Be a warrior on the Pursuit of happiness. Fight for a happy life. Don't settle for destruction. It's not what you're wanting. It won't release you. It won't. It makes things worse. That I promise you. That I promise."

you should still be asked your info by the police, but its confidential.

Please. Call the police.  Everytime.  Please.

Whether its a man or woman being abused, they need someone on their team right now. They probably feel like no one is, and are too broken inside to reach out. The fear is debilitating. The mental abuse changes your thought process and belief that you can survive without them. 

Call.  Be on that victims team. Be their hidden angel and turn them into a survivor. Keep calling. One day they will gather the courage and leave. 

Keep calling. 

Help. 

That is how you clear the energy. 

We live in a world where we think if we pretend we dont see, we are not a part of the problem.  But in reality, if we arent a part of the solution, we add to the issue not being solved. Which is a problem. 

Print posters for abuse hotlines and post them in your neighbourhood. Do small things that no one will know you did if you dont feel safe or comfortable or are unable to approach the victim to help personally.

Help. There is always a way. Save their life. Clear the energy. Its not up to you to actually save them.  Dont get my words twisted. Help. Its always up to the individual. But thats how you clear the energy. Help remove it by fighting it with its opposition. Truth and protection from the abuser. 

Knowledge is power. If you can become friends with the victim, educate them. Secretly and safely of course. Maybe they dont understand the scope of the problem because theyve been so enclosed in the abuse bubble.

Just... call. Help. Thats how you clear the energy and protect yourself from it.  Everytime. Please. Just call.

ZenHabits,f431x5a,t3_dj883s,1571337742.0,"This. So much. Find new tools. I didn't have a tool box growing up. Childhood abuse ensured I didn't have any tools for life. As a parent myself now, who fled domestic abuse, I sought therapy to help overcome trauma. The more I go the more tools I learn. Filling my toolbox has been so difficult, but when the tools are there to be used life becomes more manageable. I want more tools, and to further sharpen the ones I have. And I can only hope I'm giving these tools to my son. Everyone deserves a toolbox to manage life with. Its so much more difficult with nothing but your bare hands. Its not possible to thrive when you're constantly wondering why it isn't easier. 

Key point to be made, no one will give you the tools. You have to seek them out. And then no one will use them for you. They can show you how to use them, but it's up to you to incorporate them into your daily life. You are the creator of your life. Find your tools that you need to succeed. You aren't stuck in a shitty situation. Its going to take more than blood and tears to overcome. Pick up a tool and put some effort in. That's where the blood, sweat and tears come from.  Pick up a tool. And if you don't have one, hunt one down. Don't stop. Then use it, get skilled at it. Then find another tool. And another. And share your tools with others. We are all fighting the same battle, we just have different storylines. Maybe they can share a new tool that helps them create their story better for you too. There is enough for everyone.

Don't get enough sleep, brain now functions less than optimal. Not eating right? Now your body operates less than functional. Not showered? Now you feel less than optimal. Unfortunately this is where, again, I tell you what you don't want to hear. I didn't want to hear it either. The water thing I struggle woth most. Our bodies need water, so drink your water.  

Start small. Today just eat a fruit. Whole, uncooked. Get some natural goodness in your body.  Feed your body. Just this one act of self love today. It'll be tough. Your brain is currently wired to prevent you from doing this. But, the brain is a powerful tool. You can rewire it. Its difficult, but the less you travel your depressed neuro-highways, and the more you fight to go down that less driven path, the easier it'll be to take that exit from the freeway to depressed-ville and turn down to self Care town which leads to a shit tonne of other places you are wanting to you. You must create that route in your brain again. Does that make sense? Your neurons are used to firing down the paths that are keeping you depressed. Quite literally your brain is keeping you depressed.  This is why sometimes meds can help. Sometimes they don't. This is why often therapy can help. If you have the right one. This is why taking care of your basic needs is essential to gaining a leg up on mental health. You brain can't start to function normally if it's still in crisis. You have to work hard at not letting your brain continue to remain in a crisis state. Brain needs food, water, exercise, love, fresh air, etc. It needs it! And if you're no longer a child at home (a healthy happy home, childhood neglect can often lead young adults and adult adults lacking in personal care skills and thus leading to constant state of despair and not knowing why. I was never taught, so I struggled until I had many teachers repeat the same things to me. And they work, which is why I know it sucks tk hear again, but one day this neuro-highway we are forcing a neon sign to flash at you and call you to the exit will attract you enough to turn off.), You wont have a parent making you eat your veggies and go to bed on time. I felt dumb when I set myself a bed time, but now I am happier and energized more in the day. Not all days, but days get better with a bedtime. Be your own parent. Give yourself tough love. And gentle love. Don't beat yourself up of you aren't perfect. You wont be.  Because you're not. You're human. A human being. Not a human perfect. So be you. Therapy can truly help work out trauma and personal issues. Fear and anger can often be ignored, but if you hold onto it forever you'll always be afraid or angry deep down. You'll always come back down this depressed road. 

Take the exit my friend. Have an apple or a banana today. Tomorrow have a shower. The next day drink enough water. Its baby steps. Care for yourself like you'd care for a newborn. You are giving yourself a second life here. It can be anything you make of it. Just get over this hump. I do promise it gets better. But it's not easy. And very uncomfortable. But that's how we grow. Babies dont give up when they find out they can't do everything we can. Can't talk, eat, can't even take a dump without feeling nasty and violated and often sit in their own shit for hours. But babies grow up, they grow. You aren't a baby. You have an advantage of not sitting in your shit all day. Literally. You aren't broken and so far behind. But you have stopped growing. Its going to be difficult, but growing pains are real. You can do it. I believe in you. If not today, tomorrow. But don't always wait for tomorrow. Today is always a bit better if we can manage. But if the best we can do is prep for tomorrow, then that's a damn good job done today."
atheism,f1hwbso,t3_d9dco3,1569501984.0,"Im not going to push religion on to you, but have you considered attempting to be more mindful? Hear me out. I have PTSD and depressed, I know it's going to piss you off hearing this. It did me too before, but I will shove down your throat that it does get easier and better.  It just takes a long ass time of forcing yourself even when you don't feel it working. 

Basics. Go back to basics of self care. Are you eating right? Drinking water? Vitamins? Sleeping? Exercising? Are your basic needs being met? Check in with yourself. Ignore what everyone else says and if they judge you. And ignore what you may the thinking if it's negative. Give some kindness to yourself, take care of yourself.  Let yourself feel your emotions and needs. Label them, figure out what they are and then pound away at them. 

 Next if your basic needs are met, work on your external world. Is your home tidy? Pride of ownership does a lot. Also clutter will cause you stress. So declutter and tidy up. Just a small area a day. Open your living space and you'll feel your spirit be able to take a breath from being clogged up with all these material things.

Next i would check in with your social circle. Its painful at times, but pluck away anyone who doesn't make you feel good. These people you spend time with become a major part of your world even when you're not with them. They influence you and your thoughts ... Much like social media. Start deleting people who aren't good for you. Its not a bad thing. Its self love.

I'd say meditation, not to clear your mind, but to gain control over your running thoughts. That's my problem. I can let my thoughts run away and then I get triggered and feel depressed. Its about controlling the thoughts of your ego. You are a forever changing being. Every second you have a choice to be a different person. Its not going it be easy, but it is a choice. Do you choose to not fight back and alter your reality? Or do you choose to struggle a bunch for a better outcome? Its up to you. It won't be easy. No one can do it for you. And many people will discourage you when you rise up and they want you to stay down with them. 

Its not about religion. Its about inner peace. Being okay with you. Knowing you YOU are. And knowing that no one else can change your opinion on you, because they only have their idea of you. They probably don't even really know themselves, so don't let their judgements get to you. What they say about you says a lot more about them than it does about you. And what you say about them says more about you than them. So, what are you going to say about yourself? Are you depressed? Or are you working through challenging feelings and trauma, overcoming mental health setbacks. This is a normal life experience, you've now got the opportunity to grow as a human being. Its not going to be easy, but it's not a death sentence. You can overcome with hard work. And you'll be better off, more capable of the next challenge. Because life is a series of challenges. Are you going to rise up to them?"

If you're isolating properties of a plant you need to know what you're doing. I won't tell you to go buy the top of the line product, but if it's cheap it's not going to be good quality. Find companies that are reputable, open about testing and follow the laws. Then find the one that you're willing to fork the cash out for. Not all extract companies produce the same quality product. And some companies buy and cut their products with additives. Which is what is killing those vaping people... Do research, know who you're buying from, know what you should be getting, and question if anything looks off with any order. We don't do retail, we supply. We have clients who decide to go with the cheaper option for product and come back within a month for the more expensive, higher quality, highly cared for cannabis extracts. When legalization continues to smooth out (Canadian here) progress will pick up and we may see a decline in pricing as access to LPs and labs and research pick up. Also, hopefully the craft growers can step in and we can get those strain specific benefits we want to discover and put out to the world to use.

awakened,f0yrup7,t3_d79gkt,1569076753.0,"CBD is a cannabinoid, there are hundreds in the cannabis plants at different stages of its life cycle. What kinds and how much potency depends on many factors (strains, soil, harvest, curing time, water, sunshine...etc) and they plug into our receptors in our body.  

The endocannabinoid system (ECS), everyone has this system, regardless if they partake in alternative medicine. Its natural and we're born with it and we use it on our own. Highly recommend you googling endocannabinoid system and clicking on the first infograph Google spews at you. Just understand the magnitude of effect it has on your body, and understand that we are only truly just discovering (edit word) THE SCOPE of its functions. This is relatively new information to the world, there is so much unknown. But so much we already do know, so feel free to jump in and know that you aren't far behind in learning. And you don't need a biology degree to understand things. Find outlets that educate you in the way you absorb information.

Anyways,   The purpose of the ECS is to help the body maintain or return to homeostasis. To help bring balance. Its not a cure, but it can assist in healing.  In all parts of your body. Seriously, the ECS has receptors in your brain and all over your body. It plays a role in everything. You are a whole, you taking CBD will not benefit you in just one way. It'll benefit you in many ways. 

I do think CBD and other cannabinoids (cbg, cbn...) Each have their purpose. Researchers come out everyday with information and new studies thanks to the world fighting for legalization. If we're trying to get whole, this can be a tool you'd want to have in your kit. Mine helps with anxiety, I have PTSD. It isn't a cure, I go to therapy and work on myself and take care of my body, but it helps. And I believe it's a better choice than my pharmaceutical prescription. ...also for menstrual cramps and post race day cramps. Marathon recovery lasted three days versus the week plus I was expecting. 

Cannabinoids can help you feel better in so many ways, a little research into it can help enlighten you to their benefits. 

I work for an extract company and we push the alternative medicine aspect of cannabis, as well as recreation use. I run the company's cannabinoid education page. Its fascinating and I highly recommend adding cannabis to your lifestyle in a way that best suits you. 

Straight CBD in pill form, tinctures, full spectrum, smoke a joint, transdermal patches, gum, lotion, ointment, toothpaste... Find what works for you. Find the cannabinoids you feel good taking and in what way. Its not just about getting high. You're changing what you do to take care of this body, be aware. I don't like popping Zoloft and Prozac, but I will pop a 25mg CBD pill and find I'm quite capable of overcoming my day on my own with my own energy and power. Its my choice, its natural and I'm not putting a synthetic foreign material into my body. Everything is organic and natural, which is exactly what I want. 

What do you all want? Anyone else choose alternative medicine over pharmaceuticals?"

You choose to feed your kid even if it means you go without. You choose to feed your kid if it means going to the church and wait half the day with a number in hopes to get day old cold pizza from the local pizza shop. You choose to feed your kid when you have just a few bucks left after rent. You choose to feed your kid and go to the food bank, to the women's shelter, transition house, local bakery, discount grocery store with expired food. You go to the thrift store and ask for donations and hampers. To the local health center. The local mosque, even when you're not religious, and you respect them and follow their traditions because they respect you enough as a human in need and feed your child. You find a fucking way. Those who choose not to should not be called parents. I fight mental health and physical pain and do it all on my own. There are little valid excuses. You find a way to make it better for them. Even if it's hell for you. You find a way. There are many. Some hard to find. But you find a way. You don't stop until you feed them every day. That's your choice. That's the option you take. You choose not to be a parent, you deserve to lose your kids.

Those who matter will be there, those who don't matter, don't worry your beautiful soul over.

This day is about you. They don't want to be there for you? Their loss. You are going to have others there who are absolutely thrilled to have you enter in their lives. They stepped up. They are smiling at you. These are your people. 

It hurts to leave your past behind, especially those who you considered dear to you. But if they chose to stay behind when you have them a pretty invitation to join you, that'd their loss. And your gain. You don't need that. It is okay to be hurt by this. It means you are genuine. That you care. That you're not a bad person. But you're not wrong for continuing forward without looking back. 

You are starting your new life, your future with your partner. This is what matters. Keep people around you two who support you two. Who will show up. Step up. Be there. These are your people now, love. Your people will be at your wedding for you. Your support. It's just presented to you in a new way, with your wonderful new spouse leading their way. Clearly, Hun, you picked the right one. He's got your army to back you both in your battle against life. 

Chin up, beautiful. 
Don't cancel the wedding.
All your friends will be so sad to miss out on having you join them in your future. 

And congratulations sweetie. I'm so happy for you. 
And I'm so proud of you.
Good job."
ptsd,ey6hrjn,t3_cvlkd3,1566855901.0,"Permanent. Yes. Death sentence, no. It will affect you forever. But not wholly, forever. It will get better, just work on it. I'm at the point now where most days I laugh at the fact that I'm diagnosed and survived long term massive trauma. Seems so unrealistic. And I'm a capable person in society. 

But there are days when i am triggerred. Anniversaries hit. A panic attack. Something. Sometimes the littlest thing. And it hits me. And I'm run over and back at square one. Enduring the pain as if it were happening all again. 

But I work on it, I've learned how to overcome, regain control, how to maintain having more good days than bad. 

It'll be forever. Whether or not you choose to let it disable you from living a full life is up to you.  Live a relatively normal life if you want. Just like everyone else with a disability or severe illness. 

I'm not trying to say it's not a big deal, but don't let it define you. Your mental health does not define you. Don't let it. You define you. Who are you? Who are you when you introduce yourself? That's what matters. Not a diagnosis. Don't let your diagnosis be the only thing that matters about you. You're so much more. Even if your brain doesn't let you think that all the time.

selfimprovement,ey5761u,t3_cvk3m8,1566823934.0,"Do you know your Meyers Briggs personality? Discovering more about who YOU are and how YOU interact and react with the world may help. Sometimes learning theirs as well can help understand their interactions and reactions. Self understanding has helped my reactions a lot. 

Also therapy. Dealing with past trauma. My last round of sessions I went to I went in straight up asking her 'can you teach me emotional regulation?' and I spent the next 4 months doing just that. I still struggle, but having someone help me learn how to accept, experience, and sometimes roll off an emotion has changed my life. Nothing I could say would do justice of a properly trained professional. But they will teach you that you're not wrong for feeling this way. how to better control. Much how everyone is saying 'give less fucks'. 

...Well that's hard unless you have been taught.  Everyone kept telling me to give less fucks, to read the book the art of not giving a fuck..  all the things were said. It was therapy that did it. A trained professional, the correct one matched with me and my learning type, whom took several years to find because not all therapists will work for each individual... I demanded to be educated on emotional regulation.

If therapy is expensive, Google, podcast and YouTube emotional regulation therapy. Seek funded group counseling, ask around not-for- profits, if you want it bad enough you will find a way. Also, online therapists found via Instagram and stuff. Don't know their credentials, but I'm Canadian and access for me was zero issue. Not a brag, if you're Canadian there are so many options. If not Canadian, you just need to look a bit harder. People want to help people. Even if you don't have a lot of money. Sliding scale counseling exists as well, they base your bill off your income so those with less money can still access services. Health should not be a privilege. It sucks money can be the one factor that stops you. Don't let it. Don't let the system win.

A lot of mindfulness. Be aware of your thoughts and feelings, why you feel this way, is it logical, what is the true situation, what can you change, are you happier now?  Can you change it any better? Then accept it, experience it, and then let it go. Will it matter in 5 years? 2 years? 2 weeks? Tomorrow? 

This is you growing up. It's going to be uncomfortable and painful at times. And downright embarrassing. But it takes a fucking grown up to grow up. Don't be upset about your emotions. Having emotions doesn't make you broken or a handful. It means you feel, and are passionate and brave! Not many people can walk around like us everyday. Experiencing the world like this. But it's a gift. For as low as your lows can be, the potential for joy and happiness in your life, and love, is unlimited.  Be passionate. Just learn how to be in better control and understanding of yousrself too.

Happy emotions! From an INFJ."
ptsd,ey2rcbt,t3_cv8ffr,1566746501.0,"Hmm.  I'm going to admit to not have read the body text l, just the title to prevent myself being triggered. But I just wanted to give some positive vibes to you. 

What you are going through is tough. What you will continue to go through will be tough, tougher and easier. I say this from experience. 

The brain is a beautiful organ. Don't treat your PTSD like a death sentence. Your brain is not destroyed past the point of repair. My darling, you have been injured. And in such a way that your brain thinks this is normal. Because it has been the normal. Healing your brain is going to be difficult. But not impossible. 

Much like a muscle injury, or bone injury, if healed and trained to function improperly, you must work excessively hard, and sometimes make the painful steps backwards in order to heal correctly. You are injured. Not broken beyond repair. Your doubt and feeling of doom is your injured brain. You reaching out like this is the healthy you fighting to heal. 

You will never be healed to the same as before your trauma. Don't mistake me. But that's okay. This adversity will not define you wholely forever. It will give you a strength if you choose to grow from it. Don't play the victim. Not forever. Play the victim while seeking help in healing. Go to therapy. Be vulnerable. Be the victim. And when you leave, be the warrior, fighting through the pain of near extinction as you fight to see another day. 

Your days will get better. You must fight. You are a warrior. Your trauma is a part your story, not your plotline. The hero always faces cruel pain before finding their path and absolutely taking off in life. Use this time to really ground yourself. Find out how to care and nurture yourself. Basics, square one. Create who you want to be from scratch. This is a new beginning, not a mourning of your past. This is your creation. The stronger you, more aware, educated, experienced. You are going to be greater than ever before. Believe it.

You are your own hero in your story. Your therapist can help and give you tools. But no one, not your friends, family, doctor or pill can make you recover and improve your life all in itself. It's on you. Set up support, don't be afraid to seek it out in ways you didn't expect. Be brave. For yourself.  Don't give up. For yourself. Its going to feel hopeless time and time again. That's the time you just make it to the next day. That's your win. That's your fight. To survive to the next. 

Practice self care. Practice mindfulness. Practice taking good physical and nutritional health. These are important factors in healing. Surround yourself with positivity, healers and those who are moving in the same direction of you. It may hurt, but continue to remove toxic from your life. 

Just fight. Fight to survive, my lone warrior friend. You are alone, but not alone. We all must fight our own battle back from trauma. It will make you a stronger person in the end. More capable than anyone will realize. They will admire you. Your strength. Your perseverance. You will inspire. You have no idea. I wish you did. You are amazing. 

Keep going. You're not the victim. Not anymore. Victims don't fight back. Victims don't seek a route back. You're doing great. Everything you're doing is exactly right.  It doesn't have to be a grand step forward everyday. But just don't unpack along the way and decide you're comfortable being the victim again. You aren't. You're a warrior. 

Keep going."

Find friends outside of school for him. Explore and figure out his interest and hobbies. School friends only last for school years. These people are thrust upon you, much like family. You had no choice to survive with them. Friends... Friends are people you choose to have by you.

If you really want to help, help him find hobbies outside of school, outside of the internet and computer friends. Help him find his interests. His people will follow. They'll be people with his interests, who can hold captivating conversations with him. Who will maybe introduce him to other hobbies, other friends, other directions that may inspire his life. 

It's not about exiting the problem. You will be bullied everywhere unless you are the bully. Life will continue to hand him this lesson of bullies until he learns to overcome. Physical abuse can be stopped with teachers, school changes and restraining orders. But growing a good personality and character is what you need to help him Do. He's probably a great human being, help him see that in himself. Spark some fire inside him, let him light up and give the world a chance to find him. He just hasn't found his place yet.

Life is fluid and ever changing and I needed to continue to grow, learn and adapt and find the joys in life. I love being a mom. It is a major part my identity. My son is 5. This is the stage of my life where I am learning to be a mother. I'm discovering my identity as one. And after when he is older, I will discover who I am... Who I want to be when he has grown. And again when I become a grandmother. 

The trick is to remember that it isn't your only identity. You are not ONE thing. You are many things. I'm a mother. A friend. A trail runner. A cross stitcher. An animal lover. A philanthropist. A hard-working employee doing what I love. My identity is not just mom. But it is who I am. It's a major part of me. When my child is older, he will still be a major part, but a smaller part. And it is at that moment I will recreate my image of mother second and alternative hobbies and passions first. Because his first identity will be dad.

If it was made up, I'm a positive this is an experience that mirrored another's. I have never experienced this, but when I share my struggles people often think it's a joke. I often think 'theres no fucking way'. That my memory is skewed. That I'm playing it up in my head.  There is no way life can be like this. 

Life is messy. It is exactly like this. For so many people. And it's different for so many people. Different, but just as bad.

I grew up in a white family. My birth father is first Nations. My mom raised me white in white neighborhoods with white siblings. This is going to be a life long struggle. You have a child of ethnic background. Be strong about it. Take pride. Because life is always going to tell you that your child is a different colour. My mom took me across the boarder once and they thought she stole me and was trafficking me. A little white lady taking a little brown girl on a ferry across a boarder. Your child will need your strength. Whatever you are feeling, always remember to think of what they are feeling. They are going to feel different. They will deal with racism. They will have that struggle of having skin a certain shade that society doesn't seem as number one. All this that you're feeling... Use it as power. Take control of this situation. Think of your clever witty backhanded comebacks. Have them prepared and practiced. Use them without hesitation. Have your equal rights and Native Pride speech honed. 

Your child is looking to you. Your reaction will be their reaction. But they are the one that is different. They are the subject. They will feel what you are feeling times a thousand. Teach your child strength. I tried to wash the dirt off my skin for years. Not understanding that I wasn't white. Because my mom raised me white. 

Be proud. Your child is an amazing human being, regardless of skin tone and ethnic background. But be strong. I have little wisdom to offer you, other than your son will catalog your reaction to his skin tone. Find a way to deal with this, take power and control.

Learn to budget. I go by Dave Ramsey rules. Go on assistance if you need to. It's not a thing to be ashamed of. Work the system, it's what it's there for. But keep working to get off it. Don't settle. You deserve better. Start saving. Even it's just $10. Save a bit every month. It will add up. 

Seek therapy. Coming from another mom who fled domestic abuse. It's okay to talk to a stranger who can maybe guide you towards mental health tools to rebuild yourself. Abuse is a lot to endure. Do not take your mental health lightly now that you've left. Because you're going to need all the mental strength you can to get through the hard days of life. 

Find your tribe. I call it a tribe, some call it friends, sisters, a village, a family. Whatever. Find them. Reach out to them. Cultivate your friendships. These people are important. Ask for help. Celebrate wins. Support them. And they support you. Having people is important. Having good people is more important.  So be careful who you invite in your life. 

Don't give up. Mostly it's just getting to the next day. Some days are going to be great. You're going to get a lot of good news. A lot of good things are going to happen in life for you. I promise you that. But there is also a lot of crappy things that are going to happen. A lot of doors will slam in your face. A lot of people will sneer at you, make assumptions, put up road blocks. Don't give them a moment of your time. Let them have their say, look them up and down and walk away. Don't even waste your precious breath. They aren't worth it. Anyone who tells you no is just sending you in a better direction. Keep looking for the yes. Keep looking for the helpers. They are there. Share your story, bits that you want to share. You'll be surprised at how many others have had similar situations and will be more willing and open to help or direct you to help. People like to help people who help themselves. So don't give up. 

If a day gets too tough and you cry and decide this is the end, then make it the end of your day. Sign off, turn on Netflix, snuggle your babe, eat comfort food. Cry.    Then get back up and attack tomorrow. We all have our limits. You aren't defeated on days like those. Those are the days when the universe is telling you that you are NOT IN FACT SUPERWOMAN. You are human woman. 

No one can do it all. And that is what is going to feel like you're going to need to do. But you can't. You are not Superwoman. I say it again. Because you need to know you aren't defeated. Youre a normal person who is doing so much more than normal. 

Have goals, reprioritize and asses every few months. Look back at your wins. Keep track. Take photos when great things happen, post them on your walls. Surround yourself with love, happiness, motivation. Believe in your future. 

Believe in yourself. You can do it. It's going to suck. But it's still going to be an amazing life. Because YOU are amazing. Super-woman. You fled abuse. That's a hero move in itself. You saved you are your child's life. Way to go. I'm rooting for you.  Your life has just begun again. Anything is possible now. What do you want to make of it? It's all up to you. You're free. Fly. Find a beautiful place to land and be happy. You're supposed to be happy. It's good to be happy. Don't ever let someone take away your happiness again."

I control my world a bit more.i love myself a bit more. I found people who love me a bit more. Andi found some things that I love doing a bit more. Society lies to us. About everything. One thing they lie about is what a woman can and should look like. We are not all made the same. I am unique. And there are things about me that are so amazing, that I would never give them up to be that standard of perfection. It's literally unattainable. So it no longer bothers me as much. I've learned to love myself, my life and the things around me. And I've become much happier."
SingleParents,erh390m,t3_c1zib7,1560866006.0,"Something I have to constantly remind myself when that wall hits. 

I can't fill my son's cup from my empty pitcher. Or something like that. In other words, you are an adult. You're a pitcher of water. You've grown. You've learned.  You're experienced. Your daughter is a cup. She's new, growing, learning and pretty topsy turvy. Her little cup needs refilling. So frequently that often times you can only pour a bit of water here, a bit of water there... You're trying to keep her cup full. It takes a village to raise a child. One pitcher will not help this childs cup stay full. That's too much to ask from one pitcher. This cup is careless. This cup is a leech. But this cup is the most amazing, most precious, most perfect cup in the world. As her father you are going to automatically try to fill her cup the second a drop drips out. But what about your pitcher? If you're always jumping to refill her cup, your pitcher will empty. If your pitcher is empty, how will you continue to fill her cup? 

Fill your pitcher, dad. Take a few moments. Remember that while this is for you, it is actually also for her. She will grow up with stronger relationships with others because she felt safe when she left her dad. And she needs to see and learn over and over that you will return. That you'll always be there. You'll always come back. She needs others to fill her cup. As much as you love her, she needs more people to give her experiences. She's so young, she needs to learn how to read peoples emotions and build lasting bonds. It's hard for any parent to let go. Wait for preschool or kindergarten. Haha. 

Text for updates while you're away. Get snaps and Instagrams. Phone or FaceTime. Grab a teddy bear and take it with you. Take photos of it places. Print them and put them in a photo album. Do it on every trip and then give the album's to her when she's old enough to look through them. Kids love photos. The Teddy is your daughters so you're bringing her along. There are a few ideas to keep that connection there for you, I am sure there are others.

You deserve a break. 5.5 years later and I still regret sending him to Grandma's once a week so I can get s full sleep and go for a hike. But I also recognize a lot more now that I need to taking care of me. So that I can take care of my son. There is no one taking care of me but me. It's no one's job anymore. No one's but mine. My son, however, while I have help, it is my job to take care of him. In order to do my job, I need to take care of me. It's awfully exhausting. But that's what I signed up for with Parenthood. An awfully exhausting yet absolutely wonderful lifetime experience. 

Enjoy your mini vacation dad. Put your feet up. Indulge and think about nothing but yourself for just a moment. Be free of Parenthood for a moment. Recharge. Refill. And get back at life when you return with nothing but joy and excitement to be reunited with your daughter. You'll be happier and more relaxed. And she will be too as a result."
AskWomen,erd0pu0,t3_c1a9tj,1560727436.0,Found out the best relationship I have is with myself. And now I spend time nurturing and loving myself instead of feeling empty and lost because I'm single and can't find a person I click with. Sure it's lonely at times. But I'm actually a lot happier right now than I've been in a long time.

SingleParents,erb8jz2,t3_c15jqj,1560666429.0,"I feel like you'd benefit from reading A Family Is a Family Is a Family https://www.amazon.ca/dp/1554987946/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_f.DbDbR2MYDQ2

It's for children, but I found myself tear up a bit reading it and feeling so much better about my family. Our family may be small, and I may have bought a fish to bring us to a prime 3, but we are indeed a family. I hope you can work through this and claim the feeling of being a strong, happy, and complete (for now?) Family. I didn't consider myself a solo parent until 2 years later. These things take time. You are normal. These are normal hurdles to jump over. Not everyone has the same hurdles. But maybe that book can help you get over yours. It helped me jump mine.

Edit, word"
simpleliving,er53vw3,t3_c0etmb,1560517394.0,"I've never used paper towel to clean unless specified at work. I hadn't considered it, because even then it's sparingly used . I grew up in a cloth cleaning family. As an adult I've started buying plain white board cloths for cleaning. I wash them separate the rest of my laundry. For dishes I used brightly colourful towels that make me happy. Anything to bring a smile to my day. ...also anything to make one of my least favorite chores a bit easier to endure. I will wash these with my bathroom and bedroom linens. For mirrors I often use newspaper. 

Feather duster is great for pictures and shelves. But I find only if my home is minimalist. If I start hoarding this becomes a hassle and I just stop dusting. 

I wash my floor by hand. Soap and water and rag. But I don't mind running a Swiffer and broom every day or two between a deep clean of the floor when I decide I am ready to put the energy into it."

SingleParents,eqga8jn,t3_byb3qn,1560033612.0,"Workout with your kid. YouTube mom and tot workouts or yoga videos for free and easy access. 

Take some pressure off yourself. Anywhere possible. When there is less stresses on you in other aspects if your life you will find you can focus and be more present. Even if it's as simple as buying that pre-cooked oven roasted whole chicken at the grocery store and a bagged salad or a quinoa salad for dinner after work instead of worrying about cooking. If it is nice outside, go for a picnic. Chances are you'll have leftovers for lunch or dinner the next day. Make it an adventure and pick out a new side dish together every time and see what tastes better. 

I find it's the little things. Those last moments in bed before they fall asleep. Putting the phone down. And not picking it up. (put on silent to avoid the urge to get that dopamine rush by seeing what that newest ping or vibration your phone offers you) they like that. They notice that. Or at least, they notice when we reach for it again and again. 

Go for walks. Go explore. Find a new park. Find a nice trail nearby. Be outside together. If you can get. A jogging stroller strap that kiddo in and go. Together you can do so much with a jogger. You get exercise. Together explore places. Sign up for a 5k race and make it a goal to just finish it. Together. Become empowered and accomplish something. Have a goal and know that you're not only setting a good example, you're spending quality time, and creating a healthy and strong childhood. This is the years you create what their world will be. Whether it's actually finishing a non time competitive running race. Or a kids peddle-less rider bike race or whatever. Have something that drives you towards something that makes you better. Challenging yourselves. Everyone starts at level zero. What better time to start at level zero and gain a new skill and start a new hobby that you truly enjoy than with your young child? Experiment. Try a few things. Find what clicks with you. This purpose can help with self confidence. It helped with mine."

UnsentLetters,eq56nyi,t1_eq4ewbb,1559793937.0,"Excellent! I'm proud of you. And you should be too. You have just proven to yourself that no matter what you are dealing with in the moment, you can make it to the next day. Just take one day at a time. One hour. One minute. Be proud of you. Discover who you are. Find out what you want. And don't stop until you achieve it. You can do it. You just proved it to yourself. A broken heart can be mended only by time. Don't prolong the pain. Fight it. Fight and make it to the next day. You may have to wait, but someone better will come along. Someone so much better. Be patient. Fight for the next day. I promise you that one day it'll dawn on you that life is better. That it happened. Bit by bit things fell back into place. It will suck. You will cry. Scream. But fight for it. One day it'll happen. You'll be happy again. Healthy again. Only this time, it'll be better. Because you've grown. Be proud of you. Every day is a battle. Every day is a victory. One day closer. It'll happen."

SingleParents,ep0b55v,t3_btm0tk,1558973178.0,I've been considering the same. Everyone says I'm so young and have all my life ahead of me. I'm about to turn 27. I know I'm young. So why don't I enjoy my life and focus on my son and being happy with everything I already have. Because I am happy with my life. I just have this idea in my head about what my romantic life should look like. Maybe I need to change that idea. I thought I was being ridiculous for thinking this but now I know I'm not alone in this thought process. Thank you.
