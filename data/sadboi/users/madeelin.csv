SuicideWatch,fo9puzi,t3_g6h7q5,1587627034.0,"my boyfriend explaining our future together and telling me I would miss out on all of it if I died. Usually when I'm super suicidal I'm very numb, but that's how he unnumbed me and I got off the ledge because of it"

SuicideWatch,fo3q31h,t1_fo2m8a3,1587491094.0,"The issue with doing nothing is the fact that it disappoints others. I still have school work that I'm expected to do even though I'm unable to attend lessons because of time differences, it's nearly impossible to learn anything from a textbook with brain fog. Can I just say that I can't do it because of my mental health? I haven't even told this school that I have depression, I wanted it to be a fresh start compared to my last one. I didn't fall asleep until 5 am too :) but I'm PST"
SuicideWatch,fo2i78b,t3_g5c3go,1587463394.0,"I'm sure there's a good reason to crave attention from your parents, all kids want to be loved and cared for by their parents. I'm pretty sure it's an instinctual thing. Im sorry they compare you to others, I personally don't believe that's beneficial in any kind of way and would never compare my future children to others because I know how much it hurts. And how it leads to self destructive thoughts/actions. Try to keep in mind that you don't necessarily need their approval or attention to be considered valuable and successful in the eyes of others. i vented on here earlier, and some really nice people left comments and helped pull me from my downward spiral. I hope people like that comment on your post too. I hope this helped a tiny bit, I'm still really new to this"
SuicideWatch,fo2huwl,t3_g5c7ck,1587463027.0,"I have that voice too, it really drives me to the breaking point sometimes. Yet I'm still here, and some days the voice is barely noticable. I had entire weeks when the negative voice screamed and it was all I could hear. I hope your voice quiets down soon, you deserve a break from it"
SuicideWatch,fo2hkyf,t1_fo2frqy,1587462724.0,Thank you for making me feel like I'm not alone in feeling/thinking this way. Hugs to you too

Your comment was very reassuring and I appreciate you for taking the time to say something meaningful. Im also very glad to hear everyone is doing jackshit. Maybe I should get off of Instagram because that's where all the seemingly  productive people reside. Thanks for your kind comment :) made me cry - in a good way?"
SuicideWatch,fo2d3ma,t1_fo2cey7,1587457826.0,"that's a good point, I think I'll keep it saved. Just to tell my brain to fuck off when it tells me the good will never outweigh the bad"

Sure one could argue there is none, or there isn't enough to justify enduring the pain. I'm not sure how to counter that last thought though"
SuicideWatch,fo2c4kl,t1_fo2a8j4,1587456795.0,"True, but I hate to think I went though all of this for nothing. What if x number of years down the line nothing has improved? What a waste of time money and resources that was spent on me"

But if it doesn't work out, I'd wish I ended it sooner and ended the extreme pain before it began. I suppose it boils down to: what if enduring the pain now is a waste because it never ends up getting better like everyone says it will."
