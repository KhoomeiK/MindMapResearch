AskEngineers,foptunn,t3_g8t1j1,1587971945.0,"Ok. So just for street cred, I had my PhD in ME. and went on to work as an automation guy on the production floor. To say that to never expect new grads to know anything useful is *only* from the perspective of the advice giver's very specific field. Strong fundamentals are always useful in the sense that kids strong in many fundamentals (e.g. hands-on small application circuits, programming/sensing, basic system dynamics/controls, mathematical physics) have a better chance of handling whatever *related* task being thrown in their direction. IMHO.

Give them fundamentals in very specific contexts, and maybe present an overarching concept and students can chose to explore their own interest as project assignments and present to their classmates. There are soooo many *industry-specific* applications that it is tough to pick and chose. I have seen classes that chose topics relevant to **local industries** \- aerospace, MEMS, geo-power, hydro-power, marine vehicles, mining, what have you. Many students will want to stay local and they as well as local economy can benefit from that.

I also agree with what many posters said about the need for students/interns to *learn to ask questions*! My take on this is some students need time to formulate good questions. This is where research-oriented projects are good. You can guide them in the types of questions you want them to ask.

As far as the lack of production value of new graduate's ""entry/intern level"" projects that other posters described goes - that is mostly a function the individual 's inclination to pay attention to detail and work ethic, and less about their technical prowess. So I suppose you can teach around learning the attention to detail. HOWEVER, I have taught the type of classes you spoke of, and you can only do the best you can. There will always be students you cannot reach.

Good luck! You should not expect your students to ""know anything useful"" either, Dr. Sophomore Circuits Class. Going through the basics of sines and cosines if you have to deal with trig manipulations is a good idea."

biology,fok55bk,t1_fogvna1,1587835590.0,"I haven't worked with optics and sample preparation much but that's why I'm asking questions here! I'm just an engineer who hopes to find off-the-shelf components (standing on the shoulder of giants, as the saying goes) and contribute my own expertise in data analysis and automation. I used to take the route of trying to know-it-all in multidisciplinary projects but now I understand my limitations in time and responsibilities. Collab of expertise is the way to go."
