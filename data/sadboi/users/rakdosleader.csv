DadForAMinute,f1c3okh,t3_d8l3dh,1569349191.0,"It sucks having your heart broken like that. To have someone you care for so much betray you like that, well, it plainly just sucks. As lame as any old man will say though, you got to see a side of this person that you might not have seen.

They lied to you. They boldly lied to you. Is that someone you want to be romantic with? You’re more important than that. You’re to valuable to let yourself be okay with this.

It’s going to hurt, and its okay to be hurt by this. Grieve, but know when it’s time to move on. Take care of yourself during that time. Love yourself and don’t ever think you aren’t unlovable. 

I love ya buddy, and one day, someone will too. Love yourself, take care of yourself and keep yourself happy. 

Love,  

Reddit dad."

infj,eu7kpnc,t1_eu7fo1z,1563535066.0,I had this mindset as well until I had to come to the conclusion that I am allowed this leisure time. I worked hard so I am allowed to play just as hard. You’re not useless. You’re doing something. Relaxing. You need to in order to make the next work feel substantial. It is duality my friend. Two sides of the same coin.
Wattpad,etwouvk,t3_cdwav2,1563279638.0," The Vangen have served the Contanis Empire faithfully for nearly three centuries. Hand picked from foreign lands, men of the Vangen hold no political ties, agendas or creeds except to the Emperors and Empresses who sit upon the Onyx Throne.  They are vanguards, protectors, loyalists.  

They are the Vangen Guard.   

The officers of the Vangen lay siege to the lands of the Oriens when they receive a letter bearing the Empress' seal. Written within are orders that leave the Vangen little room for debate. Take the hill and return home. As to why, the Empress does not say. What trouble then has stirred within the Capital that leaves her orders so vague? Loyalties shift and a black tide turns. Will the Vangen sink, or swim?
