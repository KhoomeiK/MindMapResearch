AskReddit,ezcgooc,t3_d0s53i,1567834818.0,slightly happier. but mostly just dumber. also get more worried than necessary by the things I do see because I don't understand the situation.
BPD,eyve3e9,t3_cyylkx,1567490237.0,I relate to this so much. I feel like I don't know or understand anything at all. it's so frustrating. I'm so sorry you have to deal with it too.

AskReddit,ey4lir2,t3_cvjnau,1566796674.0,............ Me.
AskReddit,ex5fz8u,t3_criikf,1566023090.0,yes it was  because they wouldn't let me do anything that allowed me to grow as a person. They acted as if we had to take turns bettering ourselves and it was always their turn. Didn't want me to go to college until they got a more stable job even though our money was separate.  Didn't want me to move to next town over for better opportunities until they could move too which they weren't even trying to make work. Didn't want me to have hobbies we couldn't do together so if they didn't like it we didn't do it.
depression,ewqvpfb,t3_cpidz8,1565681399.0,"I can relate to this so much. I've cried so many times because I ""just want to go home"" while I WAS home and I felt like such an idiot and I didn't understand what was happening but that's all my brain could come up with. ex bf was so confused when he would try to comfort me when it happened."
therapy,eufj2ey,t3_cg86ou,1563776441.0,"I think I might understand what you mean. I've always had a hard time being excited/showing excitement about anything as well as being openly positive about anything. I even feel dumb for making it known if I like stuff. like certain artists, activities or people because it makes me feel embarrassed and stupid and vulnerable for anyone to know what I like or what makes me happy. It's gotten a bit better in recent years but i still can't admit to liking something without pointing out that it's probably stupid of me to like it."

BPD,eqzn471,t3_c01b49,1560402978.0,yess. it sucks so bad I don't know what to do with myself and my life because I don't know who I am and I don't know if I actually like the things I think I like. so frustrating.
toastme,eqzliww,t3_bzw98x,1560402176.0,You have the nicest smile!

relationship_advice,epsmcbx,t3_bvubpa,1559454695.0,Compare him to a guy you're really into and tell him sex would be better if he was more like that guy.
BPDSongs,ep9psam,t3_bu6pb7,1559114110.0,used to love this song so much I'd listen to it multiple times a day for probably a full year. it helped me through a lot of rough days. thanks for reminding me that it exists.
offmychest,eow686r,t3_bt7tmz,1558905567.0,my bf/exbf(it's complicated) would encourage me to drink excessively at parties then when I started getting sloppy embarrassingly drunk he'd haul me off to random rooms and start doing whatever he wanted to me and manipulating my mostly limp body into positions that helped it happen. it always felt weird to be upset about it because I willingly slept with him plenty often but hearing about it happening to someone else helps me see that it's a fucked up thing to do and its normal to be upset about it. sorry this happened to you btw
selfharm,eop70xj,t3_bslebj,1558756348.0,I'm so happy that at least someone has caring parents
