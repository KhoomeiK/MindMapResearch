depression,fb8al49,t1_fb89r1i,1576609745.0,"I do try, and trust me I'm not as bad as I was in terms of coping, it's just that it still occurs, and usually I am able to control it, but every now and again I slip.  They are not toxic, I can vouch for that, having experienced previous toxic groups before. Normally, I wouldn't even think that my best friend hated me. I have already begun therapy, and it has helped. What I was more on the lines of was that I hate that despite the improvements I've made, it's still occuring again and again, especially after I have spent the last year putting effort into improvement. And yeah, I know it's unrealistic to expect to fully be free of this, but when I feel the pressure of work or college, it tends to amount.

I will definitely take your advice onboard. In the new year, I will try harder than ever before to improve my mental state.

I do appreciate the advice, and I understand that 'harsh' advice is needed. Thank you"

It's a part of being human, everyone will suffer it at some point, some more than others. Don't think that it makes you less of a person. It makes you stronger. 

If you worked it out before, you can possibly work it out again if there's any issues he has with you're depression. I don't believe that he will."

I'm not sure about what advice to give to be completely honest. I just think that if he's a good boyfriend, even if he doesn't understand completely, he'll try his best. 

I hope everything works out for you :)"

The best example I can think of is actually Captain Holt from Brooklyn 99 - he's gay, but it's not the only detail about his character because he has so much more about him then just his sexuality. So just make sure that if you do write a character not as a white male, then don't make their ethnicity/sexuality the only detail about them."
