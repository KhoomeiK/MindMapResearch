BorderlinePDisorder,fbfktv0,t3_ed1tpr,1576813038.0,I just got diagnosed like 3 days ago and my head is spinning. I'm so angry because this illness ruined the last 8 years and I just blamed myself for being a bad seed
bipolar2,fb1fr5s,t3_eb0p4f,1576436280.0,"I relate so hard to this post. Even right down to the eating disorder and being drunk and raped. It's like I know it's not my fault because I'm the one it happened to, but if I wasn't wasted that night I could have fought back harder. My appointment to get help for all this is tomorrow and I'm pretty sure it's going to be the start of a sobriety."

depression,f878q39,t1_f878k15,1574320736.0,Yeah doesn't exactly help the morale
depression,f878fxk,t1_f878az6,1574320357.0,Theres more to the story. I have anorexia and possibly schizophrenia. I went to the mental health team and they said we can't do anything until eating disorder people see me. So I contacted them after my four referrals doctors sent over the course of a year and they said I'm not sick enough. New Zealand mental health system is very underfunded and so they told me to go to my doctor every couple weeks till I have irregular heartbeat or something
depression,f87894x,t1_f8785xj,1574320107.0,It's because Ive worked at my cafe for three years and have always been very chatty and open about my eventful life so they got very concerned when my sad period lasted more than a season

schizophrenia,f8707x9,t3_dzcfgs,1574311678.0,This reminded me to take my meds
AnorexiaNervosa,f7jev78,t3_dwhrst,1573776130.0,I did tell them that. I also told them that I was prescribed citalopram for my bulimia. And then six months after taking it I wasn't b/p anymore but I had delevloped anorexia - one of the listed side effects of the medication. I also told the doctors I'm suicidal and they still increased my medication which in the first couple weeks will imcrease feelings of suicidalness
AnorexiaNervosa,f7je5i1,t1_f7jd5wo,1573775712.0,I saw a mental health team a few days ago. They doubled my citalopram/celexa to 40mg and told me I have big anxiety and lots of stress in my life. They're chasing up eating disorder services. I put my first referral for help with anorexia in November a year ago (I'd already been through treatment for bulimia a couple years before) and since then three more referrals. Still haven't heard from them.
