 This is coming from a guy with BPD who has been in LDRs before, long distance is SO hard to make work when both people aren't doing their absolute best to ""be there"" for each other constantly (you barely even see her in pictures, never heard her voice before, and you can't turn down her sexual advancements without serious consequences?) while not actually being there.
