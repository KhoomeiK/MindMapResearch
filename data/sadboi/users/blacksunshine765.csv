bipolar,f6hd9w0,t3_dr969u,1572843780.0,I am an extreme example of this. I have no memory of probably 2/3 of my adult life. Literally. I barely remember anything of the births of my 3 daughters and so many other major life events. I've had 2 courses of ECT and I'm sure that didn't help. This has definitely been one of the most difficult aspects of BPD I've had to deal with. It's heart breaking to listen to family members talk about parts our history that included me and have no recollection of it whatsoever.

bipolar,ep9giui,t3_bu0iq1,1559109747.0,There are always other meds and sometimes side effects lessen with time. Don't give up hope

bipolar,eolrazl,t3_bsccou,1558675137.0,"I had a very prolonged (2+ years) and severe depressive episode about 20 years ago. After trying several combinations of meds I ended up having 2 courses of ECT's, 12 treatments each. Usually treatments are done with electrodes placed on only one side of the head (unilateral), thus causing a seizure only on one side of the brain. That's what I had for the first course. I had some definite improvement, but not enough, and then I started to backslide. My Dr. decided to give me bilateral treatments, which can be more effective but also potentially cause more long term problems. I was truly in hell at the time and I don't remember a lot about what the treatments were like, but the results were miraculous. It took several weeks after the last one before I came out of the fog I had been in for two years plus by that time, but as I did I truly began to feel alive again. I have some memory problems and some other cognitive problems but the vast majority of it is most likely caused just by how severely ill I was for so long as well as side effects of some of the medications I take. I have known other people who had unilateral treatments only and they said they have described only very minor memory problems that went away within a couple of weeks after treatment. So that's my experience. I wish you the best"
bipolar,eollqt9,t3_bsa5fh,1558672755.0,Definitely stay away from the cannabis. I think it's very possible that the risperdal could be causing what you describe. Talk to your psychiatrist about it and maybe you can try another medication. There are a lot of newer meds that play the same role as risperdal but might not have the same side effects. Good luck
bipolar,eoeokey,t3_bre4zw,1558502711.0,"Thirty years after I first began showing strong symptoms and twenty years after my first hospitalization I still doubt that there's anything wrong with me beyond my own weak character. My depression has been so bad that it acquired psychotic features. I still remember what that was like. I had two courses of electroconvulsive therapy. Today I take between five and seven different medications, depending on where I'm at with cycling, not just to control the bipolar itself but also to help with the cognitive problems that resulted from the (bilateral) ECTs and from the damage the illness did. I'm on permanent disability. And still I question whether, if I was just a stronger person, I could get off all the meds and be a totally normal and have a life like everyone else. I don't obsess about it. I've had many years of therapy that enables me to keep those doubts buried deep. But they are still there."
