InteriorDesign,fl7l3c1,t3_fn2nsl,1584903972.0,"It's a great start and very impressive, but it needs finishing details. Add an interesting sculpture or something to the middle of the dining table, and add some art to the walls.

You could either go very intricate/old world in these additions to juxtapose the style already there which would be interesting like with ornate gold frames for the art, OR you could continue the very modern style and have clean and smooth lines in the art/sculptures. I'd keep the scale of these additions large to match the large scale of the other elements in the room to maintain balance. 

Either way I think colors, if you choose to add them, that would work nicely are gold, blue, deep green - gem stone colors. I think those would look great with the very natural color pallet already present."

I don't agree with the custom car thing though. For me, at least, I think it's because I'm able to be real and vulnerable and compassionate, and guys don't often get that so they feel safe and comfortable and fall for that. If you're already friends you have enough in common, add on that they can have deep and/or emotional conversations with you and they're gonna fall.

That's a great idea to keep going to campus, I think I might do that too except that it might defeat the point if no one else is there. There should be some way for people to have in-person or just regular human interaction if they need it during all of this. Either a once-a-week optional meetup or an online chat or something.

I think you should be honest with your therapist or if you don't feel you can be, find a new one. They're there to help you, not judge you. Also try DBT therapy because it changed my life and it helps people with or without borderline.

I'd say it manifests a little different for everyone but a lot of it is intense anger/outbursts, and fears of rejection/insecurities. There's also the fun of depression and suicidal thinking and/or self harm. Of course there's more but those seem to be the predominant things we all have.

You are still so young and BPD can get better. I'm 29 now and am actually doing really well. I was able to completely turn my life around.

Do your best to find a job that you will be able to handle, whatever that might be. A boss isn't going to know you have a mental illness when they hire you. Having one will make you feel better about yourself. Even if it's something you can do from home. Figure out how you can start doing something productive. I find that's really helpful.

If even that feels like too much right now find a hobby that you enjoy. I like to make miniatures. The kits run about $20 and are very engrossing to make. But find something you'll like.

Try to go to therapy. DBT is expensive but if you can afford it it's the best treatment for it. It changed my life. If that isn't possible get the DPT workbook and go through it on your own. It's not too expensive and is an amazing asset to have. It can really help. 

Live with your family as long as you can to save money and hopefully have a support system.

If you think you're going to hurt yourself call the hotline someone else mentioned as often as you need, it's free.

Most of all, I promise you it can get better. I wish I had someone to tell me this when I was your age. I didn't kill myself at that age because of my younger brothers too so I completely understand. It's hard work but you can have a better life that is worth it.

And remember you're in no way not wanted by society, you're going through a bad time. Those are not the same thing.

If you need any help or advice I and others are here, please reach out."

If he said you can talk then hopefully you can have a healthy conversation about it. Ask him what he thinks is toxic that you've done and really listen and figure out ways together to help each other. Maybe listen and then take time to reflect on what you each need and how to handle it. 

I've totally been there before and it feels like the worst feeling in the world but I can tell you from experience it will be okay.

I have plenty of friends who don't know how to do makeup well and ask me for help... and I love it! Ask some of your friends who like makeup and/or are good at it to come over one night and teach you. Chances are they'll enjoy doing so. Also, watch youtube videos on how to do makeup for looks you like and practice, practice, practice at home in your free time. 

Start with just some blush and mascara as those are hard to mess up. Then maybe a tinted moisturizer and concealer. You could start with a pencil eyeliner which is much easier than liquid.

I used meditation (the Headspace app) and DPT for a few years and I don't even feel like I have BPD anymore most of the time. It really works. You get to a place with the DPT skills where a lot of it starts to just happen on its own. I'd recommend working on one skill a week in the workbook on your own if you need to. And finding a good DPT therapist/group helps a lot too when you can though I know that can be hard. 

Good luck on your journey!"

For eyebrows, try filling them in with a pencil as that can really help.

For hair, find a shampoo and conditioner for oily hair. Use a brissel brush to distribute oils and dry shampoo too to help. If you're having a bad hair day and in a rush just dry shampoo and a cute messy bun. 

For the face, moisturize and use sunscreen! That helps skin so much. Find one that works for your skin. For moisturizer I like gel texture oil-free formulas that aren't likely to break you out but can still hydrate. And for sunscreen get one that's oil-free for the face. 

Finally a nice concealer, blush, and mascara can really brighten up the face and make you look young. I wouldn't go with heavy makeup as that's likely to age you more. Use a little concealer under the eyes and anywhere you're red, just spot treat with it. Use blush on your cheek bones, a stain blush can be really youthful looking. And a black mascara will brighten the eye area and open it up. If you want to do a bit more go for a brown pencil eyeliner too and a radiance cream or highlighter. 

If you want any product recommendations let me know! I'm 29 but most people think I'm still 22. I've gotten the youthful look pretty down pat. 

And most of all confidence. This comes across as so beautiful and gives you an inner glow you can't fake. 

Good luck, you got this!"
