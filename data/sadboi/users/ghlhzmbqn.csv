I had a very negative experience with my first psychologist, who (after helping me a lot with depression and social anxiety) completely shut my ideas down. She fired questions at me about what symptoms I would have and why I would think that as she didn't see it. Eventually she said ""well I can send you to a psychiatrist so you can get proof that you don't have it, if that would give you peace of mind, but it's a very tedious and hard process."" and that just demotivated me so much that I cried in the car after and felt like I was a liar with a made up sob story.

She did refer me to a different psychologist to deal with anxiety again, and there I realised how much I still felt like I was different from others, slow, not good enough, forgetful, and sometimes just plain dumb when I know I could do better.

She mentioned ADD first, and did a few tests and talks with me and thought it would be ADD but referred me to a psychiatrist specialised in ADD to be sure. After one appointment with her I got diagnosed.

Book the appointment. It's such a relief for me to hear it from a ""professional"" and stop wondering if I'm making all of this up. It took me 23 years of life to get there and I am very glad I didn't wait until I was 30 or 40 to know for sure."
