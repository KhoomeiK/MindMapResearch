1. History as a fact collecting exercise is something that started with the scientific revolution. Prior to that, information is relayed very differently. This is why you can use religious texts for historical information, but not as a word-by-word exact account. It also means theres no first hand data of anything old - its oral tradition, archeological interpetation, etc. All texts pre-scientific revolution must be read differently and in their context.
2. If anyone is actually interested in reading more, identify and look at the work from the history and religious studies professors interviewed by Lee Strobel in A Case for Christ, Reza Aslan's Zealot is excellent, and there are several others that I can't remember off the top of my head. If anyone can remember the handful of Romans from the timee that referenced a Jewish Zealot going around, please do pipe in - i know at least one of them referenced Jesus at some point. Also, if you are willing to bring it into consideration, cross and compare appearances in the Bible and Islam to identify what is agreed on between the two."

The historical Jesus is quite different from the American figure of Jesus, so my vote is yes he existed, but he was not the doe eyed, white skinned person printed on childrens bibles. Reza Aslan has a great book about him called Zealot.

Now did Christ rise again from the grave? We have no standard for evidence for ressurrection given that we cant exactly do it on demand, so i

replyallpodcast,fkuq93s,t3_fktovf,1584554120.0,"For me, ReplyAll turned out to be the olive branch that made a poor working relationship into a fabulous one. My coworker and I had extremely different personalities, values, and expectations for each other; and it got to the point where it started creating arguments and frustration between us. 

Along comes ReplyAll: I don't remember who found it first - we both loved podcasts - but it became a core part of our increasingly powerful working relationship. We both related to different episodes - he'd get references that I never did, and I'd get excited about tech issues that went over his head - and when we started explaining these things to each other, we ended up getting to really understand each other. Somedays he'd disappear into his own work so deeply that I assumed he was mad at me, only to get a message two hours later that said ""Hey, sorry, I'm in my own space. But have you heard what Alex/PJ said this week!?"" And we'd howl together over the things that happened in each episode - Alex going to India, PJ getting mad at Yes-Yes-No becoming Sports-Sports-Sports - or chat over the coffee machine about whether Phia's successful phish of the office would work at our workplace or how cool Sruthi's coverage of something had been. It got to the point where even though we no longer work together, he'll still shoot me a text from time to time to say ""Hey, you're going to love the new episode. It's right up your alley."" 

So RA acted as the bridge for a working relationship, and it worked so well that I miss working with the guy!  Thanks Alex and PJ and crew - you guys are so incredible at what you do, and it lands home. Keep it up!"

Anxiety,fjjuufx,t3_fdsrvx,1583412846.0,"Sending you a big hug. That's a difficult one! It sounds like an anxiety that likely stems from respect for others, but has gotten a bit swollen.

As someone with a fiance on the opposite side (he hates other folks' eating sounds when they chew with mouths open), I can at least give you this one assurance: No one minds a big chug of water now and then. The sound isn't gross or disruptive to others, generally speaking, so its a pretty safe one to start with!

If you want to make a game of it, deliberately challenge yourself to do a big chug of water every now and then. Even once a day. If you dont do it that day, no biggie, but if you do - congratulate yourself or treat yourself to something. It might help to show your body that most people don't care about low or medium noises from you. 

Heck, you could end up reminding others to stay hydrated!"
Anxiety,fjjuemk,t1_fjjs9fs,1583412473.0,"I got that a LOT in the earlier years of my anxiety (i was in uni at the time, which was basically pressure-cooking me).

In recent years, finding a really good therapist (my first one was a good therapist but a bad fit) has helped me carve out that safespace and protect it. 

Its a really frustrating thing though when your home space isn't enjoyable because of anxiety. I think those were some of the worst and longest days of my life. So I feel for you pal."

Anxiety,fjjrvig,t3_fdn0s2,1583410120.0,"I think that theres a bit of an important balance here for everyone: You need to be able to create a safe resting space for yourself that you can come back to and be relaxed in, and then you also need to go through the motions of pushing anxiety off of events/activities that are things you need/want to be able to do in your life. I've genuinely only been able to make progress when i had my nest to go back to at the end of the day  to recoup the energy of pushing back anxiety, and when I was recovering two or three major points of my life from anxiety (E.g. fear of eating in public, fear of job meetings) at a time rather than ALL OF ANXIETY. 

Picking what you want to reclaim from anxiety  makes it sooooo much less of a big general ""just fight it off"" garbage experience. But more important than that was, for me, having the right to chill in my space and within my comfort limits every evening or for a few days at a time.

Thats my experience. For you, all i can say is: Ive been in those shoes and theyre shitty shoes to be in. I send you a big hug."
