She loves animals, but they are so neglected especially the lizards. The bearbies are all in empty tanks. They don't have any floor because my mom cant get to them over the piles of clothes on the floor, and her boyfriend doesn't want to put blankets down anymore because they poop on them (obviously). One of them has severe gout, and she was only given her own tank recently. Their lights are on inconsistently, and they don't always have access to water. The dogs don't always have water either, and one of them has already cut himself in the mess of the house. They eat random things off the floor, and I'm not sure they are old enough to eat dry food. The only reason she got puppies was because her one of her dogs got out of their gate and was hit by a car.

BPD,fl1rblh,t3_fm0vty,1584734681.0,"Definitely not and your mom just sounds narrow minded. It is like telling someone paralyzed from the neck down to walk it off. For some people a job or education might help, but for others including myself it adds a lot of stress which then makes my emotions and thinking a lot worse.

When I'm not in a good state mentally I can't handle things like school or work, and trying to do those things without proper support from someone who actually understands what you are dealing with is impossible. If you don't have the comfort and support to fall back on, adding more stress will just make things worse. It is hard to have a stable job and get an education when you feel so unreal and unstable.

I think that both school and work are very rewarding things, but only if you have the capacity to handle them and the support to maintain them. If you aren't at a place mentally that you can keep a job or attend classes regularly I think your main focus should be getting to that point before you dive in. You are the ultimate decider when you are ready, but you have to put forth the effort to get to that point.

I'm not sure how reasonable your mom is, but of you can talk with her about it definitely do so. She doesn't see things the same way you do, and she might not know what you need. I cant speak from your experiences, but I know that my dad came off as a huge asshole, and in a lot of ways he is, but ultimately he just wants me to succeed and doesn't mind the pace I do it, as long as I am always making progress. It probably doesn't feel like it now, but once you are in a better place and are making those steps it will hopefully be better.

You definitely cant cure BPD by working or studying. There isn't really a cure for BPD. You just have to manage it. The most common ways of doing that is through therapy, DBT, and meditation. Goals, values, motivation are a huge part of management. Sweat, student loans, tears, paper cuts, labor? Nope. Not listed as a cure unfortunately. Jobs and education will be more of a struggle than a cure. It will be difficult and suck almost guaranteed at some points. It is rewarding to succeed, but if you aren't managing your BPD in any other way than hoping to succeed, it won't last."

My vet has even said that his teeth have improved since they last seen him. He is going in for professional dental cleaning in a week. I think that if your cat's teeth are already pretty healthy you probably just need to get the greenies and maybe try to brush on occasion.

To brush my cat's teeth we have a very oversized hoodie that my boyfriend or I can hold him in close to us, and then the other person brushes.

He did try to keep everyone on track and prevent bickering. It was just really hard because mentioning anything in person would have definitely escalated the situation, and since Tom's character was maxed out, there wasn't really anything he could do in game to punish Tom. When he looted the corpse, the DM's notes said that any kind of ill acts would result in the spirit attacking the party. Tom threw a fit and said that he didn't do anything bad, he took the stuff to give to the daughter (unlike all of the other stuff that he took for himself apparently).

I talked to my boyfriend after the session and gave him advice on how to make things fun and fair for everyone. He didn't realize that he appeared to be favoring Tom. He is just a quiet person who has always let the loudest person talk the most. We both kind of felt forced to let him play because he was our roommate. Also none of my friends or family could make it, so we needed his friends for a proper party. He had never played with Tom before, and didn't expect him to be just as much of a prick in game as out. It did suck when the DM took Tom's words and actions as the party's words and actions. It led to me almost dying due to an ambush that I was still 80 feet away from at the time. I don't really fault my DM on that encounter though because it was necessary to progress the story somewhat.

I haven't given up on D&D yet. Unfortunately my only other experience so far is still with my roommate Tom, and I will post that nightmare another day.
