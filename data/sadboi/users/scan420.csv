i was adopted by my parents at age 3, and was told that it was a closed adoption. they said they did not know either my mom or dad- but when i was 15 i received a DM on instagram from a person claiming to be my relative, and that my dad is actually my blood GRANDPA. i do not have any biological ties with my mother, but this caused a lot of insecurity on her end. she did not want us hanging out or having a relationship, but she claimed she did?? nothing she does makes sense. 

what my dad calls it, the “light at the end of the tunnel”, is whats bringing us closer than ever. we are finally able to have a relationship together and are able to express ourselves freely. im so damn excited for my mom to move out cause were gonna get a kitty and puppy (:"
