But I still give them walnuts and pecans when I have them, doesn’t help that she begs at the back door when she sees I’m making morning coffee. I’m the reason property management sent an email to not feed the wildlife.... oops."

Anxiety,f0kt0v5,t1_f0k8uyb,1568687334.0,"Harney and Sons makes a “Blue and Yellow” that’s cornflower(?) and chamomile. Available on the good ole’ Amazon. I *love* this for restless nights. Also a good magnesium supplement can calm nerves for a more restful sleep, coming from someone who used to have to close at work (10p), and open (7a) the next morning frequently. 

edited to include amazon."

Anxiety,eria3f5,t1_ergvze5,1560892783.0,"my dad told me to start doing this, it only exacerbated the problem to where I would just repeat said phrase over and over. Through medication and therapy I’ve overcome to where I lock and do one check, then I have to just walk away and deal with a surge of panic, then I can get over the hump!"
