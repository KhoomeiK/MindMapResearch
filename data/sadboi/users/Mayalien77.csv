Strolled him around the neighborhood, eventually into stores with me. Just super hype it up and make it associated with treats, toys, and fun adventures. He looooves it. Took about a week.

She doesn’t stop when she’s in the damn bathroom, will leave the door open on purpose just to force attention through any means. She would not stfu if you told her you were on the floor bleeding out. She wouldn’t even notice or stop (even if you were crying/screaming) to hear the sound of her own loud voice “Pontificating” as she calls it. She is a pompous snob with no reason for such undeserved/unearned high horse. She literally talks until she can’t breathe, gasps, then starts again. She could be one of those deep divers that hold their breath in for long periods of time. If she could talk underwater, the sea would be carbonated like a shaken can of soda. Nothing she says is nice, or productive. It’s always judgements and gossip. I though the Covid cloth mask would help, but she just talks LOUDER through it. I have earplugs. The tone of her voice rattled my brain. Stfu please please stfu"
