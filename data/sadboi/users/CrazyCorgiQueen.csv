The only reason I got a car in college is because I legitimately needed it for my major and practicum placements. There was only 1 district in the university town and we had a rule that we needed to work at 3 different districts. Busses only stayed in the town. I didn't get the car until I needed to go to practicums. Even then, I didn't give my parents a large list of needs like the kids did in that show."

AcePhilosophy,fqsbl6h,t3_gkmbbu,1589603014.0,"The way I think about Grey-Ace and sexuality in general is on two different spectrums. One for asexuality, and one for sex attitudes. Sex attitudes are how you feel about yourself having sex. Some people who experience sexual attraction can be sex-repulsed and some asexuals are sex-favorable and enjoy sex. Hence a second spectrum.

Then you have the asexuality spectrum that goes from Allo to Ace (never experiencing sexual attraction). I view grey as things in between the two extremes. Any more specific sub-groups will fall under the grey umbrella. Demis, cupios, frays, akios, fluxes, etc can all use grey as their label as well. I, personally, fit under two of the subcategories, however I use grey as my label. I don't quite fit either subcategory all the way and grey describes my experience more.

I think there is a lot more nuance to sexuality than statistics can really cover. There's also a lot of misinformation about asexuality and a lot of people don't even know what asexuality is. I think there are more people who fall on the asexuality spectrum than people realize. 

Finally, and I can not stress this enough, not enjoying sex does not automatically mean you are asexual. You can experience sexual attraction and not feel like sex is the most amazing magical thing that you've ever experienced. It can be like yeah it's nice, but be pansexual and find any gender sexually attractive. Asexuality is the lack of sexual attraction, not sex drive, and not enjoyment of sex."

I sat in the back of the orchestra and the director always yelled at me for not being closer to the front. Said I should always be first chair. I told him, I'm not a performance major, I'm not a technical player; but if you didn't have me where I am, your cello section would fall apart. Low and behold I threw out my knee where I couldn't actually practice my cello for about 3 weeks while I did PT. The cello section was in shambles. I was passing out fingerings, bowings, marking key changes, passing info to the basses, etc. I was teaching all of them their parts and being a second ear. By the end of it as I was getting back into it and he said, ""I see what you mean."" Never apologized, still gave me crap constantly.

Moving on. It's the teaching skills that will get you in there. Try picking up violin or bass. Ask the elementary school teachers if you can provide cheap (like $5 for 20 min) lessons for some of their beginners. See if it's something you like and pick up quickly.

From a teaching standpoint, if I have a student who is serious about playing I wouldn't really care about whether they liked to listen to the piece or not. The main reason we give you pieces is to advance technique and musicality. If I told any of my teachers that I didn't like Bartok or Tchaik, that is the first thing all of them would give to me to play. Not because they are jerks but because learning a piece has a way of pushing your boundaries and finding out cool things the composer did theoretically. The second two options are good. However, you're going to have to come back to this piece eventually. If you want to continue cello into college or play in a symphony (degree or not) they will expect you to know this piece really well. Usually, with advanced students, I would transition them into Saint-Saens or Lalo after working on Haydn. Also, I wouldn't consider it the easiest concerto. Its a staple of our repertoire like Bach.

Not meaning to kill your spirit. Just be honest with your teacher. If my student were feeling this way, I would switch it up on them, and come back to this later."

Greysexuality,fqapxlx,t1_fq9pwz0,1589223251.0,"Hi! I don't think it's that personal as it's something a lot of us Grey-Aces will go through the same thing. I did some research into sex attitudes to see where my baseline is at. Most of the time I'm neutral so I don't have a huge issue with having sex. It's more like if I'd rather not but whatever. So take things with a bit of salt if that's not your stance.

I see it as something he needs. His libido is strong and frequent. Mine is weak. I don't feel like I need to act on my libido. He feels the need to act on it. It's just like if you hadn't eaten in a while and it becomes your only thought. My participation helps fulfill that need. However I have set boundaries down with him because I have had past sexual abuse and some things are really triggering. The other day I had a strong flashback and I had to set down that I have to say it's okay before he can ask.

The biggest thing that helped me was asking my partner about what he needed sex wise, what he would like, and if anything is off the table. Getting those answers and knowing what I'm okay with allowed us to have a conversation about how this new label is going to effect our relationship. We worked together to find that area where we could both be okay with the situation. We were both willing to find a way to make it work. Do we still argue about sex? Yep! Do we get frustrated with each other related to sex? Yes! But we are both willing to work together to make it work. So let me sum up what all this means.

1) Both parties must agree to work to make it work.
2) Open and Honest communication between both parties
3) Willingness to compromise for each other

If either of you can't agree to those things it's going to be rough. It's tough. It really is. It takes work and we've spent our whole lives not understanding why a lot of people are horny and experience sexual attraction so easily. It's not something we understand. Our partners don't understand what it's like to not feel sexual attraction. They just don't. We are wired differently so we gotta work together to make it work."

Thinking from their perspective I would think questions about relationships, marriage, and kids will be on their minds. So if those things are still on or are now off the table they may ask about it. I would also offer that you haven't changed, your still you, you just don't experience sexual attraction like most people do. Also I would be a little prepared for parents blaming themselves for it. My Mom takes my illnesses as being her fault and it's not. They have no control over which genes get picked.

I know I rambled a bit but my mind is a little scattered after a flashback last night. I'm working on doing this with my parents but I live far away and want to tell them in person. I hope it goes well for you! I put resources on the side bar if you are on a computer, if not they should be in the about section of our sub!"
Greysexuality,fq6guhq,t1_fq5wvrn,1589131262.0,Honesty is very important and so is open communication. I'm sure you can find some of my other responses talking about what you are okay with and not okay with during sex and asking the other person as well.
demisexuality,fq6gilo,t3_ggzys9,1589131077.0,"This may rule out some people but you could look into putting a Queer Platonic Relationship on your profile. Basically it's a long-term relationship without sex and sometimes without romance (depends on the intent, I believe). It's tough and I'm sorry you are having a rough time with all of it."

Greysexuality,fq4yylo,t3_ggks3c,1589087666.0,"I definitely agree with slipping something in about asexuality or possibly not enjoying sex like others do. Always good to take their temperature first before going in. However, I would do so sooner rather than later. Better to not get as attached as it hurts the more attached you get.

If you feel safe coming out to him, know your boundaries and that you may need to make a sacrifice for the relationship. Yeah I know that sounds bad, but relationships require compromise. They do. I have a hardline and a softline. I am sex-neutral so I really don't care, but I do have conditions. I'm very firm on that hardline but sometimes I move the softline around because I care about my partner and I know he needs that release and connection.

Now your hard and soft lines can be different than mine, but you need to know what they are. If you don't know, be honest with yourself and your partner that you don't know yet.

Overall, just be honest. It's really important. I hope this helps!"
Greysexuality,fq16oif,t3_ggbsq5,1589042502.0,"It could also be that you are demiromantic. You might have to be friends first and wait for that romantic feeling. Reflect back on other relationships you have had and see if that's the case.

Also if you are just at a loss as to what to talk about, there are loads of resources out there for date questions. Heck my Husband and I went through some just for giggles. Like if you could have any one superpower what would it be and why? Or if money were not an issue, what career would you choose and why? What is the first law you would make if you were given ultimate power? Or first 5 laws? You can also talk about TV shows you like, books you like, movies you like, events in history. You could even bring a notecard with ideas. That could even be a cute story in the future. It's okay to feel awkward or to be ""bad"" at dating. All of us were ""bad"" at it at one point."

warlocksriseup,fpr0ylh,t3_geprpe,1588838544.0,"Not to mention a few of our bounties we're bugged so we couldn't even complete them. Same as hunters.

This whole event needed to be operated on percents and so far it doesn't seem like that at all. It also doesn't seem like the scores reset every day. The first and second day were the only ones I saw a difference in flags. Even logging in at reset showed no change. I see people on subs saying it's reset but it's just all garbage.

There is like no loot from this event too. Get Heir Apparent and ghost shells. Yay. The rest of it costs silver or get lucky with 10,000+ bright dust and you can get it all.

I'm grumpy about this too. It's not just you.
