depression,f1qdjd4,t3_dak6as,1569698596.0,"I’m only 16 and had my parents help so I don’t know if it’ll be helpful, but this was my process of getting help:

I first went to a psychologist and after a few meetings with her she said that I should consider medication, so the process will be faster. Then she contacted me with a psychiatrist. I want to 2 meetings with her and at the end she gave me a prescription to an anxiety medication and antidepressants.

It’s only a few days after I’ve started taking these medications, but I’m supposed to continue going to my psychologist regularly (once a week) and see my psychiatrist in three weeks to see if the medication are starting to effect.

Again, it’s only been a few days but I already feel better. I finally feel like I have hope and have a chance of getting better. 

Good luck :)"
