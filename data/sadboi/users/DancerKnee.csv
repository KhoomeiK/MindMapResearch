But in all seriousness, you really can't tell unless their nose is all exploded (which happens). Some addicts are really good at hiding addiction. And since they haven't died from one thing or another by their 30's they might seem pretty stable on a date because addicts are super conscious of appearances and really goid at becoming who you think they want you to be. I say this as a recovering addict. There's really no foolproof way to know so very leery of giving any advice at all."

Fill a large bowl with as cold of water as you can. Ice too if possible but just enough where it's colder not so it's filled with ice. Put your face in it for 15-20 seconds or as long as you can hold your breath. Feel free to do it more than once. It triggers the diving reflex within your body which shows your heart rate and does other stuff I can't remember. Rinse and repeat (haha) as often as necessary. Hope this helps! You're not alone.

Having an outsider look at a situation can grant clarity when you're super emotional and I'm glad you reached out. Maybe if you still can't calm try putting your face in cold water for 15-20 seconds. Can dip multiple times if you can't hold your breath. Trust me, itreally helps ground you."
