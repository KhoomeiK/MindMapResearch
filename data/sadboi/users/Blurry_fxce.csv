Yes, I've taken tests but I'm never sure of the accuracy of the tests so I've always wondered if INFJ was a mistype. I identify a lot with the type, but there surely can't be so many of us if we're the rarest. How would I go about further exploring whether I'm an E or I? I've been told there's more to it than whether I'm an introvert or extrovert, I would consider myself an outgoing introvert though. Interestingly enough, the only time I've ever not typed as an INFJ when taking tests is once when I typed as ISFJ, so you could really be onto something! I'll have to do some more research"

If you mean what I'm assuming you mean by that, I just want to tell you, fight, flight, and freeze are very automatic bodily functions that can be activated by your brain without your control. The fact that you were scared likely activated the freeze response in your brain, as your body realized you were in danger and instantly tried to protect you in the way it thought was best. Unfortunately for your situation, entering freeze mode didn't help keep you safe and seems to have caused you feelings of guilt. Please don't blame yourself for freezing, you are no less of a victim and no more at fault just because you didn't fight back. You couldn't have chosen any different, your brain released chemicals telling your body to stay still to stay safe. It's not on you to fight back, no one should ever have put you in that position in the first place. I wish you the best of luck in your journey toward healing and I'm so sorry this happened to you."

There are no drug issues, he is quite a conservative Christian so he has never done drugs and doesn't drink alcohol. I think he just continuously overworks himself at work and is burning himself out. He's also not the most sensible person in the world, so he's the kind of person to let someone else take the wheel like this and think nothing of it.

Like a few days ago I tried to ask him really nicely not to argue so loud with my brother in the mornings, I didn't even ask him not to argue at all, and I literally said, ""it's okay that you wake me up, I understand that it's hard to be quiet when you're getting ready for work, but if you're going to argue with (my brother) or yell at him, could you please do it quietly or in another part of the house. It's really unpleasant to wake up to you arguing or yelling"" because when he yells it makes me feel anxious, plus when he calls my brother stupid or other names it's quite upsetting for me, which makes it really horrible waking up in the mornings and having to lie in bed hearing that shit. He didn't let me finish and responded saying it was ""out of line"" for me to say that, and that ""you yell at (my brother) too"" (which, I actually yell at him very rarely, whereas I brought this up because my dad had been yelling at him super regularly- almost everyday) and ""when you have an argument you don't plan to have an argument"" basically saying that he didn't intentionally argue in the mornings, it just happens.

It's honestly a really dumb construct that boys shouldn't play with dolls.

I remember as a little kid being disappointed at Christmas time watching my younger brother get super cool legos, hot wheels cars, toy helicopters etc while I was being given dresses, dolls, and bottles of scented shampoo, bodywash, and moisturizer.

AskReddit,fhzd187,t1_fhza64d,1581996387.0,"I agree with you, but the problem here is where exactly do we draw the line? What if someone is chronically depressed and has been so for years? Who gets to decide they aren't suffering enough because their pain is mental and thus shouldn't have the choice to end their lives on their own terms? Why should people be forced to live just for the sake of it, when they don't want to? 
In western society there is a huge divide between mental and physical illness and suffering. 
What if there was some sort of intensive therapy program, that mentally ill people could attend and if by the end of it, they were still unable to manage their symptoms to a satisfactory degree and still wished to end their life- would you agree with that being legal or no? Some mental problems aren't curable, some are. Some are manageable, some are less so. It's definitely a really tricky situation, because people who aren't of sound mind technically aren't fit to give proper consent. I think for now though, what you said should be legal. But I definitely think we should consider the mentally ill at some point, and look at whether it's possible to give them that right safely or if doing so carries too many risks that we can't safe guard against."

1) Sure, that tattoo will show your individuality, but people will assess you based on what you present them - will that tattoo more often be an asset or a liability? 

2) You will always be changing, can a tattoo change with you? 

3) This tattoo represents your ideas/beliefs/values/priorities today, but how sure are you that it will still represent you correctly in a years time? How about ten years from now? 

4) Have you considered the implications, like the risk of illness/injury to your body? The financial cost? The potential for others rejection or your own regret? What is your motivation for getting this tattoo? 

And then she had this: ""My challenge, should you choose to accept it... 

Is to take the tattoo you are considering getting and make it into an art piece. 
Put this art on your wall and keep it as it is, in the same spot for 365 days.

Plus there is a common theme that when you argue with a Christian and directly quote a verse from their Bible that is really awful, they will either say ""that's not what it says"" or ""that's not what it *means*"", in plenty of debates I've see growing up, Christians will twist verses and their contexts to fit their own ideas and beliefs, but if anyone else does that they complain about the verses being taken out of context or used incorrectly. I honestly laugh at the old religious debates I used to have with some of my Christian friends because we could both interpret the same verse in opposite ways according to the point we wanted to prove. 

Christians also like to say that ""the word of god is alive"" and that god ""uses the spirit to speak to people through the Bible"", if that's true, why the hell is the spirit telling hundreds and hundreds of people completely different things? Surely if a hundred people read the exact same thing, and the exact same divine power helps them to interpret it, then those hundred people would be able to agree on what it meant? But yet there are so many different types of Christians, you have Calvinists, Anglicans, Baptists, etc. And even people who are the same type of Christian disagree on so many fundamental things about the religion.

And don't you just love how when someone's body does exactly what it's supposed to do - which is, survive! - god gets the credit for ""a miracle healing"", but people die every day and he isn't expected to take responsibility for that? How does a supposedly all-powerful being just get to take all the credit for everything good happening in the world while taking no responsibility for the bad? 

I mean, I understand why religion was created, humans have always feared the unknown. So I don't blame people of the past for making things up to try to fill the gaps so they could feel more confident and less afraid, and so they could create some sort of comfort for themselves. 
But now that we have taken such great leaps in science and technology, it's time to leave those childish ideas behind. Religion has no place in the modern world, it's only holding us back now. 

Even if god could be proven to be real beyond reasonable doubt, the god of the Christian bible is an absolute monster and I'd rather burn in hell than conform to his rules. It's crazy that Christians think god gives us a choice, it's hardly a fair choice if it's ""love me and obey my commands like a slave or burn in hell for eternity"". It's like if someone were to hold you at gunpoint and say ""give me your money or I'll kill you"", a fair judge isn't going to let the thief off on the basis of ""you *chose* to give them your money-they gave you the choice!"", that's not a fair choice."

My dad used to embarrass and humiliate me, not even for a punishment, but as a joke. Let me tell you, when you are humiliated and embarrassed by someone you're supposed to be able to trust, someone who's supposed to care about you and protect you, that shit never leaves you. I'm never going to forget that that happened, and for the longest time I used to get terrible anxiety in social situations because I was absolutely terrified of somehow embarrassing myself or becoming the center of too many people's attention. If you find someone else's humiliation, suffering, or shame funny, fucking shame on you man. It's time to take a good long look at yourself and ask yourself if you're really the kind of person who finds humor in a joke that costs another person their sense of security or makes them feel extremely uncomfortable. 

Oh and, the thing about humiliating others, is that usually the person being humiliated is someone who is in a position where they have less power than the person who is doing the humiliating. In this case, it's a parent vs child situation, the imbalance of power makes the humiliation ten times worse because she has no way of protecting herself. You have way too much power and leverage in this solution for this to be okay. 

By all means, punish or let her suffer appropriate consequences for her actions, but by god don't use humiliation as a disciplinary tool."

So are you!"" a lot of the time with other young children when I was little, they would get so fed up by the lack of a bad response on my part they would end up complimenting me (they thought since I was taking bad responses positively, then maybe the opposite would work the same-that good responses would be offensive to me) and I'd say thank you again and even say things like ""- insert teacher's name- did you hear what - insert bully's name- said to me?

HomeschoolRecovery,fg5ek6f,t3_ewyhsm,1580525368.0,"Yes, but it's impossible to achieve all of that. I have never seen it accomplished and doubt I ever will. It's just not as simple or easy as you make it sound. Unfortunately that's not the world we live in. People are flawed; that is the human condition. In saying that, however, I do feel like this subreddit tends to think going to school is better than it is. Going to school might've prevented some problems homeschooling created, but it also comes with its own set of problems. I don't believe there is a perfect route of education, both homeschooling and public school have their pros and cons. And there is no one size fits all when it comes to education either. Schooling, both home and public, *can* be done well but it's super dependant on a shit ton of different factors. And this subreddits feels to me like a ""grass is greener on the other side"" type deal. It's not. Plenty of public schoolers wish they had been homeschooled, because they also think the grass is greener on the other side. I've been homeschooled and attended public school, but I know I can't speak for everyone's experience. So do take what I say with a grain of salt, as I understand not everyone has the same experience or view as me and I'm not saying anyone who disagrees with me is automatically wrong. 
In my opinion, homeschooling works well for some, public schooling works for some as well. If your parents forced you to be homeschooled when it wasn't working well for you and public school would've been better suited to your needs, shame on them. If they forced you to go to public school when it wasn't working for you and homeschooling would've been a better fit for you shame. On. Them. But, provided you and your parents do their best, it'll be okay. The past does not have to determine how your future will go, there are a lot of ways to work around your weaknesses and utilize your strengths. There are bridging courses if homeschooling didn't get you university entrance, there is therapy for you if you were bullied in public school. Your life isn't over if you had a bad experience with education. Although, it is okay to be angry or disappointed that your schooling wasn't what it was supposed to be. Just don't spend all your time being angry or disappointed, learn to move past that and just do your best."

writing,fem6i3b,t1_fem4ux6,1579241483.0,"I would say, if you're writing rubbish, keep going. As long as you are writing to the best of your current ability, the more rubbish you write the less rubbish you will write :) every single thing you write is practice that will improve your skill level, even your worst sentence will help you improve. As long as you are able to look back on your bad sentences and analyze them, without being critical, harsh, or having an attitude of defeat, but rather with an approach of ""what can I do better? What can I learn from this mistake? What didn't work well about this?"", you will get better. No one will ever be able to create something perfect, that is human nature. Even the greatest pieces of art and the best selling books aren't perfect. Your main focus in writing should never be to create something perfect, but rather to progress. If you look at past writing and your new writing is better, you are a good writer. 

Your first draft won't be perfect, your first book won't be perfect. But your book will sell because it made your audience feel something, because they could get lost in it. Because they could escape for hours into the world *you* created for them. 
Bad pieces of writing are some of the greatest tools you can use to improve. Success can tell you what you did well, but failure tells you what you can do *even better*.

I would focus more on enjoying the process, and keeping the story flowing. There is no one size fits all for story writing, but I find it's best to view your first draft as just a first draft. And that means accepting it's going to be pretty imperfect, maybe even bad-and that's okay.
It's like artists, many artists do a rough sketch and then never use that sketch for the actual art work- rather they trace the initial sketch onto another canvas or piece of paper, and they may trace it over and over again until they are happy with the outline, and then they will apply all the colours and shading etc. The best book you have ever read never started out as the end result. 

I would just try and finish your first draft. Finish the story, and remember the story is not each paragraph or chapter or sentence, your story is what you are telling your audience. I can't remember every sentence or chapter of my most favourite book-and I've read it many many times- but I can remember the story. I can remember every scene that made me feel something strongly. 

Think about your life, your life is not every single day on it's own. Your life is an accumulation of it all. You, are not one bad trait or even several, you are the combination of all of your traits-good and bad. Good people can still lose their temper, but overall they are good people because of the way they interact with the world. 

Personally, if you try go back and fix things too often you run the risk of getting stuck trying to make something perfect. But if you have the skeleton, you can flesh it out and adjust it much more easily.

There are plenty of other cool things I can get up to with my dad that don't involve underwear or bra shopping, I would just find that weird and embarrassing.
And your daughter was clearly embarrassed, which you knew, and she wanted to go alone- yet you insisted on going with her anyways. Why couldn't you just give her more money to get them on her own? Or let her use your card?

atheism,fczl0ca,t1_fczgw1w,1578103538.0,"Damn, that's a really interesting take on things and I rather enjoyed reading it, thanks :)

I see what you're saying, athiesm definitely has become more about a lack of belief in Christian theology than deities as a whole, but that's personally what I'm more interested in as the Bible is full of contradictions and is honestly absurd, but people still believe it and unfortunately those beliefs can cause harm to people and society as a whole in my opinion. I'm not as concerned about the actual existence of deities, but more about the harmful consequences on society that people's beliefs and made up ideas about various deities can have. And that's not to say that all belief in deities brings harm to people or society, but religious beliefs definitely do have the potetional to- and often do- cause harm as I see it. 

I just find Christian religion a more interesting topic of discussion than other religions, purely because I'm more familiar with it and have definitely seen a lot of toxic aspects of it due to having been raised in the religion. But that's just me :)

And, personally, I'm just not interested in trying to disprove *all* gods, or god in general, as they could be real but we have no real way of knowing. I feel that is is a waste of time trying to prove or disprove things that are so impossible to scientifically prove or disprove.

mentalhealth,fcwzl1p,t1_fcwscr6,1578044521.0,"Yeah for sure, although studies do show that a certain amount of income does improve moods and for obvious reasons reduces stress, however they also show that having any more than that doesn't make anyone more happy and as for fame, well, personally I wouldn't even want to be famous because I like my alone time and privacy too much. You're definitely right that fame and wealth do not equate to happiness at all, but that's not what I meant by my comment anyways.

I simply meant perfect life not by the world's standards but as I said ""whatever that would be to them"", and I mean 'mentally' the perfect life. Because having good outward circumstances doesn't automatically mean you'll be happy, since as you mentioned that's the sad reality of mental illnesses. Even with the 'best life' people can be downright miserable-that's what makes it an illness in the first place. If it was *caused* by something that would simply be grief or disappointment for example. But the fact that in spite of good circumstances, or despite having no trigger, the bad feelings can arise; that just shows something is wrong. Of course, that isn't to say mental illness or mental illness symptoms don't have causes, but I'm just making the point that there's nothing wrong with feeling sad when someone you care about dies-because grieving is a normal human response to loss. It all just depends on how much it impairs your life, and the degree to which you are feeling certain emotions etc. 
So what I mean was, if people were truly happy they wouldn't really want to die. I get that mental illness is involved in people wanting to die of course, but most mental illnesses can be managed in way that reduces the severity of symptoms so that people *don't* feel suicidal or at least *less* suicidal. It's just a matter of finding the right coping strategies and tools for each individual, which of course is hellishly difficult to do. I hope that makes more sense! :)"
mentalhealth,fcwp5hu,t1_fcuzbwy,1578032300.0,"Oh absolutely, I know both feelings all too well.

It's definitely really hard for people to understand, and honestly I find even with the experience I have sometimes I find it difficult to fully understand even in the people I care about. It is so hard to fully realize and understand the extent of someone's suffering without being in their shoes or being them in general. You can never truly know exactly what it feels like to be anyone else except yourself, because everyone feels things and experiences life and the world in such vastly different ways.

mentalhealth,fcwoe4v,t1_fcvabz7,1578031546.0,"You definitely make a good point, after all, who would want to die if they were living their dream life and were as happy as they ever wanted to be?    Of all the people who are suicidal, I believe that very few would still be so if they were living the ""perfect life"" whatever that was for them, or if they knew, with 100% certainty, that they would one day be able to. If they didn't have to suffer, if they were completely happy etc. 

And you're absolutely right, our natural instincts are to survive-at all costs. There is always something wrong when people want to die; when they wish to go against what their body fights for every single day and what humanity has fought for for millennia after millennia. 

There's for sure different types of suicidality as you stated. I would say I'm passively suicidal and I believe most suicidal people are. Most suicidal people, myself included, want to die (or rather, simply escape suffering, pain, life etc) or consider death an inviting or comforting idea, but won't act on it for various reasons - one being that the uncertainty of death is daunting and more uncomfortable to face than the discomfort or pain of life itself. I would say the actively suicidal are more at risk of suicide, as they want to die so badly that desperation overrides natural instinct and puts them in a position where they, as the word suggests, *actively* pursue an end to their existence, or at the very least plan a way toward such a thing.

Haha me too"
mentalhealth,fcwnatp,t1_fcud4il,1578030534.0,"Damn, you bring up a lot of good points. 

I guess there are a lot of different things we can mean we say we want to die or don't want to live. 

I've thought about it a bit more to really figure out what the distinction is to me and I have come to the conclusion that personally, the difference for me -although a little blurry at times- is this; to want to die is more of an immediate thing, you want life as you know it to stop *right* now. You want the pain and the suffering to come to an end, and you want it to come to an end *now*. You don't even consider the future, it's a want focused on the present and the suffering that comes with it. 

Whereas, not wanting to live is more about the future. It's more a feeling you get when you have considered the future and decided it's not worth it, that right now isn't going to get any better in a few years or even decades time, whether it's because the pain won't ease or the pain of the present makes whatever the future might hold not worth sticking around for in the end. It's a want that comes from beliefs such as ""I'm never going to amount to anything"" or ""I'm never going to be able to achieve that which I want to achieve, or be that which I want to be"". 

But not wanting to live can definitely also mean, not wanting to do anything. Just wanting to exist without having to or being expected to function like a normal human being. 

I can absolutely relate on what you said about wanting to die though. Somehow as suicidal as I can get, I still never want to die of any terminal illness or even in a fatal accident or any such thing. Whether that comes from not *truly* wanting death, or rather simply wanting death to be completely on my own terms; I'm not sure. Sometimes it's one or the other and sometimes it's both.

And yes, I agree that in the end life in and of itself is meaningless. I find existence is more about finding a way to make it mean something to yourself, and less about discovering it's meaning in general, as there really is no meaning to discover- there is only the meaning you create or imagine for yourself. 

It's crazy looking at the statistics, of songs released, recorded, created and the miniscule percentage of them that the average person today has heard or knows of. Even thinking of the thousands upon thousands of music composers from Beethoven and Mozart's era, yet we remember only the tiniest fraction of them. And not just that, but Beethoven and Mozart were every day people with lives outside of music, yet we will only ever remember them for their music. And not even *all* of their music, but simply a very small number of the songs they composed will be remembered and one day even those will be forgotten.

I'm not worried about being remembered or not though, it's not like my corpse will care anyways. I'm just worried about the time I have now and how I spend it. I'm only trying to figure out what my life means to me, and what I can make it mean. 

Just like you, even if it's pointless I'm still going to make the most of life since I have it and might as well. Only one thing is guaranteed, and that's the present. What we have now. We may never have what we wish for, we might get what we wish for and it'll be gone when we die anyways, but we have right now. And all we can hope to do is enjoy it as much as we can right now, since we won't have it forever."
