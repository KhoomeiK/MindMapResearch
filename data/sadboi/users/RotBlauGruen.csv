nier,fqao9ig,t1_fqa21md,1589222435.0,"I totally get it because I was on the same boat (I actually finished the game for the first time just 3 weeks ago) and I have to admit that many of your grips with the game are the same I had.

Why Automata is not a 10/10 for me are the flaws in the way it fleshes out it's characters, in fact, many characters are severe under used. Adam and Eve were the ones I had a major problem with. The lack of characterization do hurt the game for me and it's the whole reason I can't think of the game as perfect. 

And I agree, gameplaywise Automata could be a LOT better. The game had so much potential because the groundwork for a more engaging gameplay is there. The chip system offers a lot of customization and I definitely loved it. Then you have good weapon variety...but it does not reward you by being good at it. In fact, being to good at it trivilizes the game to the point that everything is just too easy. The game is poorly balanced and the higher difficulties are crap...so yeah, gameplaywise is a missed opportunity and it is sad that the game doesn't offer more of a challenge, because it does feel good to play it.

Nevertheless, I did enjoy the game since Route A. Most of the side quest can be completed with 2B alone and in route B you only need to do the 9S exclusive ones. At the point I was done with the desert I just wanted to keep playing. I was honestly horrified by the whole ""This can not continue"" and the nature of the conflict. I felt pretty much rewarded with the lore and occasional character characterization that I got, that I spent most of my time questing during Route A. The first time at the amusement park was magical to me.

Route A and B are roughly around 70% percent the same. I don't know how far you are, but from the beginning you get things like the novels and the picture books, which do help the worldbuilding and keep things fresh. And just the opening of Route B is one of my favorite moments of the game, <!when you control the poor machine trying to help it's bother!> I also appreciated how different it felt to play as 9S and liked the hacking enough that Route B didn't feel like a chore. 

Finally by the point I reached Route C, the fact that I had to play almost the said campaign once more before getting to the last part finally made sense to me. The game does need it for whatever the hell the game wants you to experience. So the payoff was def there for me and getting endings D and E was less than one extra hour,  therefore I got them immediately after C. 

Overall, I really hope the game also makes it for you. BUT if you are really not enjoying the game I believe you shouldn't feel pressured to finished it, even if I still believe the game deserves to be played till the end.  And if you end up not liking it that's also perfectly understandable, the game and it's idiosyncrasies sometimes do work against it. It is a weird game and I woulnd't say overrated, but the whole praise it received created really high expectations so that as a newcomer is hard not to be kind of disappointed."
nier,fq9hetn,t3_ghh5fl,1589198321.0,"In my opinion, you shouldn't expect any groundbreaking story from Automata. The game's approach for storytelling is more subtle and it is completly fine if you are not liking it so far. The game is more about how it tells you certain things than about the things it tells. This doesn't mean that the game has narratively nothing to offer.
 
That being said, the sidequests really flesh out the world, not by much or by doing much, but some of them are really worth the time doing them and let you see some other facets of the characters. It's impressive how much they can change your perception of the bleak world you are in. 

Like I said, the game is more about the experience than about it's plot. I loved the game and there are really some brilliant moments in my opinion. My general interpretation of the games plot >!The game excels at telling a kind of existential fable about the sysiphean nature of living and being human!<

Futhermore, at moments, the game enhances it's storytelling throught gameplay in really clever ways. Sometimes even at the cost of the fun factor (deliberately so).

You won't be be able to appreciate the best moments of the game if you don't experience the whole thing from A to C at least. The whole narrative is build that way. I can't promise you that you will love it by then, but only after that would it be fair to judge Automata. 

TL;DR:  I hope you keep playing and make it to route C. The game really needs to be played troughly to be appreciated and is more about the experience than about the story itself.  The game is not without it's flaws (honesly I would give it a 8 out of 10), but when it's good, it's DAMN good and better than most games.

BPD,fjgi0vv,t3_fd9r7y,1583327191.0,"Coldturkey like someone already said. There is really not other way. For context:

My ex broke up with me after 5 years of relationship around 5 years ago. Then we didn't talk for two years. Eventually we became friends when I saw him to pick up my stuff (we live now in different cities). 

Then I visited him a coulpe of times (he lives in a big capital city, and its nice to have a place to crash comfortably when I am in town lol). We had sex (he always started it) and we cuddle and shit. It was nice, but honestly I just liked the cuddling and it was nice to experience for a short moment the things I miss the most, without actually being in a relationship because we are really bad for each other ... 

Sitting on my train home right now. This was the thrid time I have visited him since we started talking again (I am in his city at least once a year for different reasons). 

Spoiler Alert: he just cuddles when he wants sex, otherwise he doesn't want to be physically close to me at all. And I just dont want to have sex for the cuddling...So I did not want to have sex everytime this time around, therefore we had mostly non romantic interactions. Well, all our non romantic interactions are quite bad, there is nothing we share, I dont hate him or anything, but he just get on my nerves and all I ask myself is how the hell were we together for five years?

Now I finally have to close the chapter, I'll never have any kind of romantic interaction with that man ever again. I feel irrationally angry and heartbroken, like not really devastated, but still annoyingly heartbroken.  Like really, ðŸ™„ how is that possible? I don't even want him back or anything...what a joke.

Tl;DR: I got to experience post post breakup heartbreak from a relationship that ended half a decade ago because of this shitty disorder. If you are out of a relationship and it was for good, you should probably keep it that way so you don't get heartbroken again."

On the other hand, I would advice, if you can afford it, not to abandon the idea of taking some kind of medication, meds really help when you find the right ones and afer you go throught the adaptation phase. So talk to your doctor about it. 

All the best and hang in there!"

TheMarvelousMrsMaisel,faddvby,t1_faags19,1575966308.0,"Well perhaps it's really how she is. Still, I believe there are certain things, which are  not necessary for others to point out for her to get them. 

A good example of her failing to see the big picture is the whole situation with Benjamin. She needed that exchange with him to realize that her thinking was maybe wrong. That is understandable and human... But having the script beforehand and still only backing off last minute was not reasonable. 

At least they should not make her father warn her beforehand. She live in her own world most of the time, but she is certainly not that ""dumb"" to not being able figure out alone that the candidate was terrible."

This! that's the most irritating about her behaviour, is also the reason that is sometimes hard for me to accept her supposed naivety.

Like the whole situation with the right wing candidate... it was almost out of character for her, because she has been show to be brighter than that... you would expect something like that from someone like Imogene, not from her. Inconsistent characterization is the only reasonable explanation."
TheMarvelousMrsMaisel,fa88ae4,t1_fa5zuzj,1575842727.0,"I believe, the major problem I had was the delivery. She never apologized to Susie, and Susie did not only explain why she decided to manage Sophie Lennon, she also felt bad about it. She knew even if it was totally justified for her to do it, it was still kind of shitty of her because of everything Sophie did to Midge (thanks God the writers decided not to create more drama out of that situation and showed Midge to be authentically supportive afterwards) 

I know I shouldn't compare, but take for example a show like Fleabag, where the main character is undoubtly flawed, but still sympathetic. She shows not only self awareness, she also apologizes and shows real remorse which helps to soften her edges. I don't want Midge to be perfect, but sometimes the show simply doesn't redeem her in any acceptable way. 

I still like the show, it's funny and pretty to look at. It sadly does not manage to be a light hearted comedy and a occasionally serious show at the same time very well."
TheMarvelousMrsMaisel,fa5hleh,t1_fa0xzpo,1575815191.0,"I recognized the scene immediately because I knew the soviet film...and the scene was too close to the original that to me it sadly felt more like a copy, than a tribute... so I did not really like it."
TheMarvelousMrsMaisel,fa5auv8,t3_e7t2nw,1575813319.0,"I agree. She suffers the same syndrome of other ASP characters. Yes, reality gets to hit her hard eventually, but she never really apologizes for anything. 

She just expects everyone in her life to understand the reasons for her behaving a certain way and that's all she does. She tells people why she did x or y, but never really apologize for anything (and don't get me started on how self righteous she can to be sometimes and how she tends to guilt trip everyone...Ethan's  school?)

What she did to Shy was terribly bad, but also her exchange with Susie after being angry at her for taking Sophie Lennon was like:

""hey, yeah, I just realized that you probably deserve having money and nice things too. So instead of apologizing for acting selfish before, I am just going to give you my OK in the most condescending possible way :)""

If Rachel didn't play Midge so charmingly and didn't look that good in every perfect costume she wears, we would probably not watch a show about someone so self centered... the same for the characters in universe, she just gets away with it because of the aforementioned reasons.
