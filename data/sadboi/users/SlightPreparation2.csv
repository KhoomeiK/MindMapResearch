betterCallSaul,fqkjyrz,t1_fqkiqng,1589428998.0,that episode where scarface is playing. there's a 50% chance in the BrBa universe that Bauer is still in the movie.
betterCallSaul,fqjw6b4,t1_fqhg1ne,1589416079.0,im serious. don eladio probably gets told often that he looks like the guy from scarface. steve bauer surely exists as a separate character from eladio in BrBa
Cringetopia,fqjvr1f,t1_fqgsu04,1589415908.0,probably. but its what i say. i have a younger sister and she's asked me to record her doing her gymnastics routine.
