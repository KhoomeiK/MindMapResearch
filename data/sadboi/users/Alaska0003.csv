EatingDisorders,fpgcje3,t3_gco493,1588599847.0,Honestly from the things you wrote I also feel like you might have a problem. Of course I am not a doctor but if you are starving yourself to lose weight it will not end well and is a really bad relationship with food. I have the same problem tbh but I also binge/restrict and over exercise. I dont think I have a disorder too because I am really fat but I feel like you might. I feel like you should talk to someone about it and find the root because usually it is not just about losing weight. Honestly I am not really in a position to give advice since I have a fucked up relationship with food ( I feel disgusting whenever I eat anything) so I might be wrong.
EatingDisorders,fpgb5fh,t3_g59ymb,1588598951.0,I mean for me it is also similar. Like I KNOW that eating and then restricting or over exercising isnt good but I do it anyway. Why? Because I cant seem to stop. I just feel horrible about myself and disgusting if I eat and dont do anything about it. So I go out for 3+ hour runs and they usually dont end well. Like I just ran 12 km yesterday and now my knees are dead. I can barely walk. But what am I thinking about? If I can run tomorrow since I couldnt exercise and burn off the calories I took today. I know these thoughts arent healthy but the fact that I know that doesnt change the fact that my realtionship with food is fucked up. Of course no one really knows I do this and tbh I dont feel like I have a disorder. I just feel like I dont have the best relationship with food but it isn’t extreme or anything like I am not severly underweight actually I am very fat so I guess it’s fine.
IHateMyself,fntegvf,t3_ezd906,1587240020.0,Good for you. I hope to achieve that confidence one day. Preferably before I kill myself.

I know I have to get my life together and decide what I want to do in the future but the truth is I dont want a future. I just wish every night to have a heart attack and die since I am only taking up space in this world. I know I am ugly, fat, and a disappointment. Everyone says it gets better but I just dont think it does because life is just so unfair. Just now that you are not alone and I am sorry if I made you feel more depressed. I am also so sorry for your loss."
