It's nice to explore every other planet, even build bases out there, but a place I can call home, to always come back to and expand indefinitely, will always be Earth.

But ""g"" systems have yellow stars, and yellow stars generally contain more lush planets. I have found this to be true, as I've had luck, but still despite finding lush planets, most of them have like no water on the surface. I find the Eucilid galaxy to be more prominate to contain lush planets than the Essientam galaxy (I know I butchered that word).

falloutnewvegas,f5udsc6,t3_dp7f32,1572471816.0," To the town of E3 Conference rode a stranger one fine day.

 Hardly spoke the truth around him, but he had a lot to say. 

No one dared to ask their questions, no one dared to say a word. 

The stranger there among them his name was Todd Howard. 

  Dead game on his hip.

 It was early in the morning when he had his interview. 

He came riding from the south side, slowly tellin' us the news.

""This game is really popular'"", came a smile from his lips. 

He was here here to do some business with this dead game on his hip.

Dead game on his hip.

In this town there lived a better company by the name of Obsidian. 

Many games had tried to take them and those many games were dead. 

They were vicious and all killers, though a youth of sixteen years.

 And the notches on their website numbered one and then ten more. 

  One and then ten more.  

 Now Todd Howard started talkin' made it plain to folks around. 

Was a Bethesda employee, wouldn't be too long in town.

 He was here to take Obsidian back with him or have them hurled.

 And he said it didn't matter that they made The Outer Worlds.

   After Obsidian.

  Wasn't long before this story was told to Obsidian.

 But the workers didn't worry, games who tried before were slain. 

Fifteen games had tried to take them, fifteen games had made a slip.

 Then Sixteen would be Todd Howard with this dead game on his hip.  

 Dead game on his hip. 

 Now the morning passed so quickly and it was time for them to show.

 It was 9 P.M when they released this great game.

 Folks were watchin' from their PC's. 

Every body held their breath. 

They knew the Fallout franchise was about to meet it's death. 

   About to meet it's death. 

   There was just one game between them.

 When Todd came to make their day.

 And the quick death of Bethesda  is still talked about today.

 Todd Howard had not cleared P.R when The Outer Worlds released. 

Obsidian's aim was deadly, with this great game on their hips. 

 Great game on their hips. 

   It was over in a moment and the crowd all gathered 'round.

 There before them lay the body of Todd Howard on the ground.

 Oh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip.

 When he tried to charge subscriptions with this shit game on his hip.

  Shit game on his hip.  

Shit game, dead game. 

Oh he tried to match New Vegas with the shit game on his hip.

 Shit game on his hip."
