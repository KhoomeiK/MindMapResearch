Throw in new musical ideas and try experimenting if you really want to keep it fresh, but don't worry about using a lot of one key."

Forgetting that gladiatorial games had been banned in the late 300s by Theodosius

One of the big reasons for its fall was actually because, by the 5th century CE, many tribes had been invading them and the Romans just began giving them land in return for their service in the army, until eventually just italy remained in the empire"

If it's so hard to open up to your parents or therapist, maybe try talking with some of your friends about it. It can help. And, although it's hard, try to open up more, little by little, to your therapist. It's hard to make progress without doing that.

And no good parents would be disappointed in their kid because he didn't make it into a 'good' university. They're there to support you, no matter what.

Hang in there, we're rooting for you."

Online, irl, doesn't really matter. Anyone who can be there to talk to you. Try to be more social, be more open with what you're going through, be a more outgoing person. It's hard, but you can work your way up to it. Baby steps, like just being friendly with some random person, talking to people at your college/university (I'm assuming you're graduating from high school).

And remember that you always have this community to talk to. Good luck."
