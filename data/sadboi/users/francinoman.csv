Ive never really had a career face for my dreams beyond a job that thats pays enough that i am satisfied in. My dream is to have a garden heaven that is so beautiful and serene that i feel like a princess in my own home. 300 seedlings on the go currently, and today i spent 6 hours in the yard pulling out parasitic trees and things. Its going to happen one of these years :)"

DecidingToBeBetter,fbv770a,t3_ee9rp9,1577126629.0,"This year i will do better.
This year, I am taking the time to take care of my body and mind. 
No fast food, no beers in the shop on fridays, no more plateau at the gym. For my apprenticeship, it has been necessary at times to suck it up and wake up a 3am to drive to a 6 am shift in another city. 
3am start, giant coffee, whatever food is nearest and fastest.  Why not hit the beers with everyone, i need to network. 
January and February i will be studying for my interprovincial exam, and entering the final stage of my apprenticeship. If i pass, the need to network, and take shifts hours away, it all goes away. 
I do not plan to keep dragging along. Having a solid career has been my dream since I was a child to parents who could never reach stability. 
This year, my time off will be finally mine. I will take small motors courses and business classes that i could never justify time for before. I will have a garden. I will refuse shifts further than an hour's drive. If i am not dressed for an occasion there is no social event worth the empty calories of drinking. All fast food, coffees included, is no longer justifiable.
 I will plan ahead, and form a schedule. I think i can finally start living without fear of failure. 
High hopes."

The interviewer looked me over and asked if a carwash hose was too heavy for me. It wasnt, no issue. Then, he proceeded to start reading from an extensive list of interview questions that had little bearing on receiving tickets for the wash and rolling hoses. 
Questions like, if you were a tree what kind would you be? Favourite colour and why?
These went on for what felt like eons - until i decided out i was sick of it and didnt want the job. I told him i would be a bat because I love the night. Told him I would be hemlock because it was a tree of great power. Just really couldnt be bothered. A lot of armchair psychology for a carwash."
