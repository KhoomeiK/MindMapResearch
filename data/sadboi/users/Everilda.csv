There are plenty of kids out there who try *really* hard- but who just aren't very academic, but they have a natural talent for sports. The sports scholarship will give that kid the opportunity to broaden his/her horizons. Become well rounded.

Same with kids who are extremely smart but trip over their own shoelaces. College, for most kids, is an introduction to a bigger world outside of what they know.

And *everyone* deserves that opportunity. We shouldn't give more to sports and we shouldn't give more to academics. That will cause more separation- moving us backwards."

Jesus went to and touched and hugged the lepers because they were the outcasts. The ones no one would touch, talk to, be with, physically and emotionally. He was teaching people that ignorance separates us.

The whole covid 19 situation isnt because there are a bunch of diseased outcasts no one wants to touch or have anything to do with. We haven't shunned anyone. We have not turned our backs. We are still together, still loving and caring for people. And we can do that while still being safe and healthy and not spreading the disease to others. So by not wearing a mask, etc you're saying ""I dont care about your health."" And Jesus *always* cared about people's health- he followed Jewish law which included how to be clean. 

Showing people how not to shun groups of people based on ignorance is one thing, putting people at risk is another. 

So whoever made that stupid meme need to read more of the Bible not just parts of it."

2) there are lots of shade loving plants, such as spinach and hostas (but please don't eat the hostas)
3) root veggies! 
4) cold hardy veggies usually don't need a lot of sunlight since they like the cold and in colder months there's less sun. Lettuce, kale, Swiss chard are good examples.
