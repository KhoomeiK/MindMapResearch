AskReddit,fbcp0vz,t3_ecjmyg,1576729470.0,"I used to clean houses for a small company and we had this regular customer who everyone would hate being assigned to. Mostly because the house was huge, made of stone (probably a proper term for this, not concrete, but stones cemented together), the customer was very odd and she had lots of cats. 

Well she basically idolized one of her cats and he had his own room in the house. Apparently the cat didn’t like anyone going in his room, so we didn’t have to clean it and the door stayed closed while we were there. The first time I was assigned this house I went in not knowing the rule. The cat was free to piss and shit anywhere he wanted to in the room, it was fully furnished but with a crib instead of a bed and the smell that room gave off was enough to make you eyes water."

Up until a couple nights ago I had this hankering to watch ‘The Truman Show’ because that’s how I’ve been feeling so I watched it and then I see your username OP, describing the exact feelings I’ve been having. Another of these sort of mundane coincidences."
