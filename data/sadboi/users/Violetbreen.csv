All 1950s archetypes in modern day— nothing feels very real and I didn’t feel like there was anything modern about it. I felt it was jarring when suddenly we realize she’s shopping for organic food at the supermarket, for example. I didn’t dislike Dot as a lead but there wasn’t much there except her germophobia. Everything else is described as fake, you refer to her smile as being like a mask when she drops the kids off to school and you suggest she’s faking it with her husband during sex. Why all of this? I just didn’t feel halfway through we got under that mask and that was what made me stop. It was frustrating.

I like a good slow burn but this one was too slow for me. It often was one scene with the event followed by a scene or two of Dot discussing the event with her husband or the other moms. Which means often we’re getting the same piece of info several times without too much added to it. Her conversations with Peter and her tend to have the least info because he just nay says her worries.

Anyway, you do know how to create suspenseful imagery and I’m sure this is a start to something lovely. Just offering thoughts while reading it it helps!"
