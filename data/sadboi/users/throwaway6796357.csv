offmychest,fqtzxwh,t3_gkpd6b,1589649334.0,It drives me insane. I feel like Iâ€™ll never get used to it lol
offmychest,fqrj56j,t3_gkaete,1589585398.0,Itâ€™s 110% a total fucking scam PREACH IT
TrueOffMyChest,fqbhi3i,t3_ghr2xv,1589237077.0,"25 year old guy here. I love watching crime shows but the one area that never fails to make me cringe is pedophilia. Those people are flat out fucking sick. Thereâ€™s warped and twisted and then thereâ€™s people who target children

And for the record, the Nazis werenâ€™t particularly fond of gay people either. It was anyone deemed subhuman. Hitler would have done Europe a public service by killing off child rapists in my opinion"
offmychest,fppebxa,t3_gefp7l,1588800726.0,I just cannot comprehend how people can live in this day and age and actually buy into KKK and Nazi ideology. People are fucked
depression,fppc0zw,t3_gem759,1588799549.0,Canâ€™t tell you how glad I am to hear that. Sometimes siblings get it better than parents can or ever will
offmychest,fp44inl,t3_gaxycl,1588291526.0,No one should have to feel like that alone
offmychest,fobsnpl,t3_g6jrn7,1587663239.0,"Thereâ€™s clearly a lack of trust here and I think if the abortion bothers you that much that you canâ€™t tell your husband, you shouldnâ€™t be married to him"
depression,fnu1age,t3_g3ljni,1587252602.0,"People have to focus on themselves and their own health first, and have their own shit going on, both of which I totally get. But I agree, itâ€™s nice to see someoneâ€™s name pop up on your phone screen. 

I just deactivated my Facebook account today for mental health reasons and I already feel better. Iâ€™m a 25 year old guy and I got sick of opening the app and seeing pictures, political rants, and other shit I donâ€™t really care about from hundreds of people, as harsh as it sounds. If people really care enough about me, they have my number, Snapchat, and Instagram to check up on me. I reserve my snap for people I talk to and hang out with outside of social media. Insta is more for acquaintances and a wider audience. My phone number is somewhere in the middle"
offmychest,fntza31,t3_g3ko29,1587251467.0,World war 2 is my favorite historical subject. Iâ€™ve always been astounded that the allies knew about the concentration camps way before liberating them but never bothered to launch a bombing run on them or something. It seems crazy to me that atrocities like that were allowed to continue
depression,fni9ptn,t3_g1njdn,1586976354.0,Wow this really took off! I canâ€™t tell you all how nice it is to have this support. It means more than you know
offmychest,fnaylnv,t3_g0jl1h,1586806109.0,This is heartbreaking. I couldnâ€™t imagine what that must be like. Iâ€™ll keep you in my prayers

depression,fhuv7mz,t3_f4re4h,1581890484.0,"I made a long post about this exact feeling a few weeks back. Itâ€™s a powerless feeling when you feel like you have no future. I have two fast cars and driving is my therapy, and I canâ€™t tell you how badly I wanna take my favorite one somewhere thousands of miles away without telling anyone. Just get in and take off and see who cares. Itâ€™s on my bucket list to take one of my cars on a solo road trip across the country and this might be my opportunity"
depression,fhqlrcq,t3_f4fhox,1581806420.0,Drives me fucking crazy when people do that. They say that like they know what itâ€™s like inside our heads
depression,fh6maso,t1_fh6kw6e,1581301381.0,I couldnâ€™t have said it better myself
depression,fh5hxf4,t3_f1djgl,1581289212.0,"As fucked as it sounds yes absolutely. I find it comforting whenever suicide crosses my mind, knowing I could just go end it if it gets that bad. Itâ€™s a kind of freedom"
