So far as loneliness goes, besides speaking with a loved one or your therapist, when you do feel lonely, try to refocus your time on doing something productive or just something you enjoy that you want to get better at. Maybe try doing things alone and seeing if they really are as bad as you think they may be - go to the cafe, a restaurant, a bar, wherever you feel comfortable doing, and try to enjoy it by yourself.
