This is why a therapist is helpful, please trust me on this. Even doing it just once a month will help you greatly. I take notes of my feelings as I experience them and then I try to gather my thoughts for when I have therapy. Consistency is key, but it’s helped a ton.

So far as loneliness goes, besides speaking with a loved one or your therapist, when you do feel lonely, try to refocus your time on doing something productive or just something you enjoy that you want to get better at. Maybe try doing things alone and seeing if they really are as bad as you think they may be - go to the cafe, a restaurant, a bar, wherever you feel comfortable doing, and try to enjoy it by yourself. I’ve often found it’s not as bad as it might seem, and then there’s the possibility you may even meet someone."
