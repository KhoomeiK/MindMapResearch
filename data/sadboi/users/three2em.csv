I also live in a deeply blue state, and I will say anyone living in a swing state take their vote more seriously than me. That being said, my biggest issue with Biden is he represents a further push to the right in the Democratic Party. There is a lot of projection going on among Democrats thinking that Biden will represents their political beliefs. He has spent his entire career as a republican whip within the Democratic Party. I hear the argument that I should vote for him because of the Supreme Court pick, but Biden actively helped Clarence Thomas get a seat by attacking Anita Hill. I hear the argument about children in cage, but those children are in cages because of legislation signed into law by a Democrat president, and enforced by both Democrat and Republican presidents. I hear arguments about Muslims, and again, both Democrat and Republican presidents furthered the oppression and extrajudicial killing of Muslims. That Biden will magically align with the Democrat electorate overnight is a pipe dream. Will he be marginally better than Trump, no, but his administration might be marginally better, and maybe that’s enough for you and others. But to think that Biden will magically adopt the policies popular within his own party’s electorate, such as M4A or protecting immigrants and the marginalized in this country, you’re just projecting."

That being said, in 2016, the 65+ vote overwhelmingly determined the outcome, while 18–24 voters only made up 2% of the vote. Bernie still has a 20% chance of winning SC according to the NYT, but that win is totally dependent on young voters showing up in unprecedented numbers, which is possible.

If Bloomberg can get to the convention with Bernie at only a plurality of delegates, he’s paying off superdelegates so he wins in the second round. Thing is though is that a lot of people will be angry about Bloomberg getting the nomination despite another candidate winning a plurality. Yet the DNC has shown their hand that they hate Bernie. So should Bernie reach the convention with only a plurality, the DNC will likely hand Bloomberg the nomination. Even non Bernie supporters will be upset with this. It will cause a divide even amongst non-reactionary Democrats. All of this is speculative, and I’m heavily biased, but at best Bloomberg is trying to prevent a Bernie nomination, at worst, he’s trying to destroy the Democratic Party.

He just needs to win Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, Iowa being the big open question. But winning the first 3 primaries/caucuses will change the narrative. There will be more attacks, and should Sanders win Iowa, expect Obama to attack Sanders. All this is to say, things are looking good for Sen Sanders, but by no means determined.

I’m now in my 30s, and when I was in my teens I had no idea how destructive my actions would be for older me, and unfortunately that’s just how life is. All I can say is there is so much more to life than being the best. No one will love you because you’re the best. No one will truly care about you because you’re the best. That is the hard reality for people like us. People will love you if you learn to love yourself. People will truly care about you if you care about yourself.

Bridge pickup is a Seymour Duncan Pearly Gates Trembucker.

Sounds great. The original inspiration was the guitarist Tim Presley’s (aka White Fence) number one guitar, which looks like a Jazzmaster modded to a player series style Jaguar. Definitely weird, but plays great and sounds, well, different. Extremely twangy bridge position, deeply resonant neck position. Probably need to re-intonate it, and get some buzzing on the Low-E string, which I think is due to the Mustang bridge, as the string doesn’t seem to fully sit in groove. May file it."

I originally became involved in his campaign as a volunteer in 2016 because I believed that his message of questioning the status quo needed to be out there, but honestly I didn't think he stood a chance. And then the attacks against his supporters came, and then we were told to toe the line after what we all knew was a rigged primary. I'm not sure if I can dedicate myself the same way I did in 2016, but I truly believe Bernie is a once in a life time presidential candidate.

BPD,evrrcqk,t3_ckwy9d,1564716186.0,"I relate to this from both sides. I have such low emotional expectations from partners, but at the same time, I’m so emotionally closed down around people that I’m attracted to that I think a lot of women I’ve dated have felt I checked off everything on your list. I want to have a healthy relationship with someone where I don’t feel they’re lowering their standards for me and I’m being a healthy, communicative, and supportive partner to them, but then I start dating someone, and I see myself emotionally pushing that person away, and the few that stick around make me think less of that person because they don’t believe they deserve someone better than me. I feel like a terrible person, and I probably am, and that’s why I’m conditioning myself to coming to terms with a life of being alone. You deserve better though, and don’t settle for less."

TySegall,euhxbu4,t1_euhw329,1563836028.0,"The apocalypse setting, or I guess they call it the Gain x1000, can be usable depending on the kind of sound. Good for a super chaotic solo, but the rest of the backing music kind of has to fit it in my opinion. It also just feels intense, like you're fighting the guitar. Again, definitely a time and place for it. The twin t-scoup setting sounds really good in person. I kind of overlooked it when watching demos, but I like the way it sounds. Maybe just sounds better irl. It is also very usable when you need to play quietly."
TySegall,euhvjp5,t3_cgjdjm,1563835016.0,"As an owner of the pedal, it is easily the most versatile distortion pedal I’ve ever used. The octive fuzz setting is easily my favorite. And the Apocalypse setting, well, be prepared to have some upset neighbors. It has no chill. Pretty sure I’ve heard it on a Ty song or two."

He was then taken care for by a couple that lived next door to my parents, but when one of them suddenly died, the widow was forced to move, and my parents decided to take care of Buddy. My mother has severe cat allergies, and won’t let Buddy inside the house, but she feeds him and talks with him daily. He seems to be in good health, neutered, and has all his shots. Thankfully my parents and their neighbors have banded together to keep Buddy well fed and in good hygiene."

I'd check your motives first and foremost. I mean, I'm not the biggest fan of the DNC either, but I'm not the one living in la la land. Crowdstrike is a private company that has been involved in several major cyber security breaches. That they would risk their reputation and business to lie for the DNC is just crazy."
