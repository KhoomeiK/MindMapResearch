I used to only play for an hour or so a day and would maybe come across a shiny every week, maybe two or more. For the last few months I have been playing much more, as in roughly 4-5 hours a day if I include running an incense at home, and maybe 3ish of actually going out to the same location that isnt very big, but has an okay amount of spawns, nothing like a big city. I have now been getting usually at least one shiny a day, sometimes as many as 4. Not including Abra, in the last 30 days I have caught roughly 42 shines. My girlfriend plays about as much as I used to, maybe a little less at around maybe an hour or so each day and she's lucky to get a single shiny every few months. If the typical shiny rate is roughly 1/512, with some special cases around 1/64, you would have to click around 1,000 pokemon before your odds of not seeing one would be low.
