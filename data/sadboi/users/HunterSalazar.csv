heathenry,fq3ehnk,t1_fq2w198,1589065646.0,The headdress was the holder of runic sigils I painted upon parchment in dragons blood ink. It also helped keep me focused as it was in contact with my head as well as obscuring vision in key points to change normal vision and reinforce the feeling of it being a unique time. I have a basic plan for rituals that I come up with but add stuff as my inspiration continues during the ritual. I just started experimenting with head dresses but besides that I have my adornment beads I’m always wearing as well as my loyalty to the gods bronze arm band and a chosen servitor or talisman depending on what I am drawn to that day.

heathenry,fo9slzn,t1_fo9jocd,1587629710.0,"I draw upon Hinduism heavily as it’s a very creative spiritual expanse, and it’s been a continuous living spiritual system for longer than any other. We should look to it, those of us who are reconstructing ancestral beliefs!"

HighStrangeness,fncn7z8,t1_fn92om5,1586841192.0,He witnessed multiple UFO saucer objects projecting colors from behind them on the horizon as well as a trapezoid hovering directly above him at night another time. He wished to share other details first about his education so I let him. The next part I will upload is going to be straight up paranormal experiences from the start. This is part one. He had other experiences he will share in part two. Sorry for the long beginning part. I’ll describe more in the title in part 2.

Shamanism,fmoa1hj,t1_fmo9acg,1586251131.0,"If you have a copper bowl with a little rim on the bottom it wont burn a surface. Copper offering bowls are plentiful on amazon, look up Wicca offering bowls. I leave pennies for as long as space can hold, maybe less but up too twenty. After that I leave them under a tree. Food offerings are indeed left in nature below a tree."

Shamanism,fm0ijov,t1_fm0hhxs,1585658729.0,There are levels of enlightenment. It’s not either or. It’s not duality.
Shamanism,fm0hegw,t1_fm0gzez,1585657810.0,If what you have been through is too much then learn from what you experience and use it to become better. That way if reincarnation is real you will achieve something higher than this “hell”.

schizophrenia,fkoc6x0,t1_fknoeo1,1584384288.0,O I worked hard to get where I am. The hard work was pushing forward in life and reprogramming my way of thinking. Getting rid of old modes of behavior and accepting the trauma instead of running from thinking about it.
Shamanism,fkgp3qp,t1_fkenlqd,1584167803.0,Intentions are important and more so than objects but I have learned that objects do help and have various effects if an individual knows how to use them in their path. Different objects are used by different practitioners but the important thing is that the practitioner knows exactly what purpose an object serves and where it fits into their larger puzzle.
Shamanism,fkfu6kp,t1_fkfb3xc,1584142623.0,Man black sun orgonite especially pendant with pyramids on them are really hard to find especially with magnets in them. I was just lucky to have a friend who makes them!
Shamanism,fkfatyr,t1_fkem67n,1584130446.0,Basically yes! This one directs energy into your solar plexus while filtering out negative energy! But the pyramids must be pointing towards the wearer otherwise energy may be slowly taken from the wearer.

Shamanism,fio9dbx,t1_finxj8t,1582578839.0,"We are receivers and not producers of consciousness. And consciousness is awareness of one existing in a united fabric, to varying levels. Even trees have some degree of awareness."
Shamanism,fio93i4,t1_finb8ng,1582578691.0,"Indeed, it is about scale."
Shamanism,fimy049,t1_fimskff,1582550607.0,It depends on ones level of identification with the pain and the circumstances they found themselves in.
Shamanism,fimxw5e,t1_fimuczf,1582550509.0,We can identify with the limited part of ourselves if we wish.
Shamanism,fims53h,t1_fimqkvk,1582544875.0,"The lowering of physical energy and also a fading of consciousness, until both are null.
