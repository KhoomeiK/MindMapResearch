depression,f31umli,t1_f31ubmq,1570585205.0,Lol nah man there are no head starts in life you may not be able to change your past but you can always change your now bro just look at what you can do for the people you care or even cared about because even if they didnâ€™t care much for me or notice me I want them to have the best life they could have you just need to look at what you can do not why should you there is always a reason to not do something you gotta get rid of that and sadly I have fallen to that a lot and I still do like now but I just have to realize that even with depression and anxiety I must push on

depression,f27nq6k,t3_cml6ni,1570042289.0,"Iâ€™ve lost the one person Iâ€™ve loved, she left me last night because she was stressed with college and the distance and I guess I didnâ€™t make things easier because of the distance. Iâ€™ve always suffered from depression but have never been able to get help because I donâ€™t like talking to people about myself, I hate myself for many reasons but thatâ€™s probably the main one Iâ€™m never able to get myself to ask or do things. I just feel tired now and I want to just lay in my coffin now and rest, Iâ€™m just done with everything."
depression,f27nb6r,t3_d39ghz,1570042032.0,I feel like I lost all emotion long ago until my girlfriend left me last night then all my pain came rushing back into my life and I couldnâ€™t stop crying I havenâ€™t cried in years I had felt so numb before but now Iâ€™m dying in the inside even more than I had been before life feels useless now. I donâ€™t know if I even have a purpose without trying to provide for someone that helped me get over my past and swaddled me in comfort and support. Iâ€™ll always miss her but I know I wasnâ€™t good enough for her anyway. Sorry for the vent itâ€™s still very fresh on my mind and I have no one in my life to convey my problems to.
