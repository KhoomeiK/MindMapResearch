BPD,fqo4wh1,t3_gjwy7t,1589507626.0,"its definitely an awful conundrum to be stuck in. you care so much about what they think when they could give two fucks about you. the first time I was institutionalized was because of this reason... I cared too much about what people thought about me and how I couldn't do anything about it for them to care. 
it takes time to be content with yourself so those thoughts won't bother you...but bpd complicates this because of how much we feel our emotions. 
I'd say do the things you enjoy doing :) do things just for you to make yourself feel better... you're more than whatever someone thinks of you. you're all the things that you love doing! I know it's easier said than done and its definitely a long journey, but once you're content with yourself those things wont bother you as much. I'm not saying this is the only way to feel better bc theres definitely other underlying issues you must face but it's a start. 
the times I've turned to suicide has always been when I feel like I've lost control and those thoughts of taking my life is kind of a way of taking back that control... but it's not a rational thing to do. 
I hope this helped some :)"

BPD,fq9khoy,t3_ghlgqt,1589200829.0,"the only way she'll accept any help is if she realizes she needs it. the hardest thing about having BPD (for me) is keeping healthy relationships with people. I dont realize in the heat of the moment what I'm doing till later and by then its too late. I'm sure the people around her want the same thing, for her to get help, but if shes unwilling to take those first steps... I don't know what to tell you. my BPD has made me hey physical on rare occasions of high distress and suicidal behavior towards my bf. he's been with me for 5 years almost and has gone through three suicide attempts with me. I'm glad he's patient enough with me to stick around but you also have your own dilemmas. 
she definitely needs to find a different way of approaching arguments and not taking things so personally. that's what made my bf feel like he was walking on eggshells around me on our first year of living together... it's been hell but were still together because I wanna make it work and I'm trying still trying to control my emotions so I dont hurt our relationship or him. she needs to realize that and stick to it. it's hard at first because the thoughts and emotions throw out any kind of rational thinking and go back to square 1. I feel like BPD is a selfish thing because as someone who suffers from the disorder it's hard to put myself in other people's shoes. something I'm assuming she isn't doing if shes using manipulation and being completely irrational. I wanna tell you to get out of that situation because you've gone through physical abuse as well as dealing with her substance abuse. you might begin to resent her and she'll definitely pick up on that as time goes by. (just speaking from personal experience). at the same time I don't want know if shes the kind of person to have suicidal thoughts and if she'd act on them... :/ has she ever been institutionalized? its definitely scary and lonely at first but people in those facilities really are there to help. maybe and intervention would help? 
overall I mostly wish for your safety because the physical/mental abuse is just hard to dismiss."
BPD,fpxqq1n,t1_fptisbo,1588987666.0,"BPD definitely makes me feels super selfish so I can see why you feel that you could just be pretending. You don’t always have to be the strong one, just strong enough to not get caught up in your own emotions. I don’t know what subtype of BPD you are but there is no need to apologize! You’re coming to terms with your emotions and learning how to properly function with the complex brain we have."

BPD,fpthgvw,t1_fptg2ji,1588891328.0,"hmmmm... did the things they told you about BPD resonate with you? I felt like i was finally understood when i received the correct diagnosis. it was spooky how much I matched up with what they told me BPD is.

BPD,fptfz2h,t1_fpsebhw,1588890548.0,I haven’t seen anything really glorifying the disorder but I’ve seen people try to use it as an excuse to lash out of be complete assholes because they have bpd. Glorifying a disorder is odd for sure.
BPD,fptfl5q,t1_fpsycg1,1588890349.0,It was diagnosed with several other things before my actual diagnosis with BPD. I was told for a while that I was bipolar and then I was just manic :/ honestly it was such a frustrating thing to go through because no medication really worked until I met an awesome woman that finally helped me understand what was my correct diagnosis. I feel lucky to have met her years ago because she also has bpd and when you finally know it’s such a huge relief. You shouldn’t apologize if you’re just now figuring this out. It’s definitely a journey to come to the correct diagnosis.
unpopularopinion,fpq7k9x,t3_gesopk,1588816756.0,I think the biggest problem with it is when it becomes a personality trait instead of something you just enjoy to do from time to time.

I am trying to evaluate my emotions. I wanted genuine input and you're right. I struggle with self image which makes me very self conscious. he has other female friends and I haven't asked him to give up on the friendship. when we all hang out he avoids her like the plague of his own accord but I'm also not saying that it wasn't because of my doing either.

BPD,foud87h,t3_g9jba3,1588081796.0," I've been constantly meditating and its helping my bpd so I have better control of my emotions and anxiety. OP  taking up meditation would be in your best interest :) it's really weird at first but after you get into the groove of things everything in your surroundings begins to change. 
it's really helped bring into perspective how I am hurting people and pinning exactly when its gonna happen. for example I am aware of some of my triggers but the challenge I face is not letting my emotions run chaotic. my biggest problem is not knowing how to handle these emotions but through meditation you are provided with mindfulness. I absolutely love it. 
last night my bf and I have an argument which started because I didn't control my emotions and he ended up getting really upset. I genuinely hate how I hurt him and notice it after it's too late :( he's a great person and deserves the best but I've hurt him so much... well I thought I was going to spiral out into my sadness and get really depressed but I let myself feel my emotions without any thoughts. my thoughts are the death of me lol all I knew is that I felt bad for hurting him and I feel like I finally saw his actual pain. after I felt all the tears leave I had began to meditate. 
it gave me peace. I helped me hear and feel his pain instead of having his emotions be overshadowed by my own. 
I dont know how much of a loner you are but I am mostly alone because of my job. at least im not with the person I wanna be with all the time and that sucks but meditation is really helping me out:) I'd suggest trying it."

BPD,fopafyx,t3_g8jvs5,1587956704.0,as someone that suffers with BPD I realize I care too much about certain situations and get really picky to the point everything is magnified about a situation that it becomes more of a problem than it originally was. we are having to teach ourselves how to properly manage that situation in real Time and not our emotions take over. we end up hurting ourselves more and more and that's my problem... you. bring your great points that play into my deepest fears that control my emotions :/ if the right person comes along you have to appreciate them and hope you dont deteriorate their mind... but managing our emotions should be our first priority:/ not achieving all the things we fear might happen. we live in the now. we must handle the situations as they come the best way we can. I really encourage meditation:)

BPD,fnt2hwo,t3_g3lf37,1587233358.0,"hey... it makes me really sad to read this because i’ve been that GF and my wonderful and loving BF was struggling with the same thing you were and from time to time still is.. 
it was years before i realized that i was in the wrong asking so much time from him when he couldn’t enjoy the things he liked. i’m still struggling with certain things but it’s definitely gotten better. i don’t lash out when i wake up and he isn’t in bed with me. the man has a life of his own! i need to remind myself of that. we all have our own lives and can spend our individual time how we want. the way i see it whenever i get into that mindset is remind myself that i do not tell him how to spend his hard earn money. we both work and as long as we are taking care of our bills then everything is fine (of course with exceptions like if we really running low on cash or an unexpected expense comes out of nowhere) regardless i do try to remind myself that he will always have my back no matter what.
she might be measuring the amount of time u spend with her to how much you care about her. NOT healthy. i don’t wanna say leave her... not unless you genuinely don’t want to work through the bpd. 
bpd affects the way we thing in the daily. our emotions intensify everything in our daily lives... so bringing this up could have her lash out. 
i’m trying to put myself in the situation because honestly i think i’d feel betrayed if u felt so helpless that u needed to go online and ask for her on how to handle her. make sure you constantly remind her that you did this because you love her and want the best for BOTH of you. you don’t like seeing her suffer and u don’t wanna suffer yourself. the thing i struggle the most with is the negativity that takes over your mind when i’m being confronted. that’s why in my best opinion just remind her how you love her and why you’re with her from the beginning:) hearing you say those things will stop her thoughts from spiraling out (hopefully). 
i wish you luck.

stimuluscheck,fnk15bh,t3_fyv2nh,1587012011.0,"i’ve been trying to look around for a question my BF has with his stimulus check and i am hoping someone here will be able to help me out. 
i know for a fact he did his taxes with me this year, but i’m not so sure he actually did his taxes for 2018. we both have the same bank and for this year he made sure to get his money deposited into his account instead of getting a check or card provided by the establishment we used to file. well since we both did our 2019 taxes together we were expecting to receive our stimulus check around the same time but that’s not the case. on the 13th of this month i noticed that the 1.2k was pending in my account so excitedly i told him to check his account but he hadn’t received anything. now my question is why? we both filed for 2019 and i’m aware that you will receive the money if you filed for 2018 and 2019 BUT because i don’t think he filed his taxes for 2018 will this affect the time frame of when he will receive his money? we are really counting on it as i’m sure others are... i know that his information when we filed is correct because he received his tax return this year. 
his main concern is that we both went to the exact same place and have the same bank but i received my money before he did and the only difference i notice is that he might have not filed for 2018(?) he hadn’t worked long enough to qualify for a return that year. i’m just wondering if anyone is going through a similar situation?"

relationships,fg2cgl2,t3_ewajby,1580442406.0,"this is a very interesting predicament you’re in. years ago i introduced myself to my bf using my middle name, and after a year of dating i told him my full name. maybe because you associate her with having two names to go by your mind automatically defaults to your ex’s name while you’re doing the deed. if i’m understanding correctly, you don’t want anything to do with your ex and it sounds like you’re over the past relationship. honestly, i don’t believe it’s any kind of deep seeded emotion that makes you call your gf your ex’s name. the reason i brought up my situation with my bf is because after i told him about my two names he thought it was strange that i would introduce myself to him using my second name (which i believe is easier to pronounce in english than using my spanish first name) and only uses my first name whenever it has to do with something serious. i hoped this insight helped some :)

i know how hard it can be fighting depression. people will care but you need to trust that they will follow through to the end. even if they don’t in the end it’s about you helping yourself feel better. take your friends help! don’t worry about the little voice that says “they’re annoyed by me”. if they genuinely asked you and noticed something is up you can totally trust them :) obviously i don’t know your life story but i do believe when there’s a helping hand Take IT! you can’t fight this all on your own. i’ve learned that from personal experience."

FuckYouKaren,fet3okm,t3_eqbygi,1579371516.0,i genuinely thought people would just assume it’s common curtesy to treat workers that must deal with people to just be fucking nice. i feel so bad for that man. he must be so stressed:( hopefully that gave that woman a reality check and not complain so much to people that are over worked as is.
relationships,feiyyj7,t3_ep7h49,1579151183.0,"i’m was in a somewhat similar situation where i would accuse my bf of being way too friendly with a mutual friend of ours, and like your gf, i was reading way too much into the situation. my bf is a very friendly guy and he definitely likes to be polite and engage with anyone and everyone we meet. its an aspect of his personality that i genuinely have come to love and i was reminded of that when i read that you will attempt to be friends with her friend because that is your gf! 
he told me that our mutual friend was only a friend and he didn’t see her as anything else bc he found her annoying. 
from my last experience i feel like she is comparing herself to her friend and it makes her question herself. it’s been a year now and my bf will remind me whenever i’m doubting/ comparing myself to someone else. remind her why you fell for her in the first place and why you wouldn’t dare to harm that in any way. those small reassurances could help in the long run because that’s what helped me to get over my jealousy.
