Nietzsche,epzexy2,t3_bwjp40,1559664322.0,"Nietzsche wrote for himself, not for others. I'm pretty sure his books are not meant to be followerd, and they are, in fact, unfollowable.

They way I understand and try to follow Nietzsche is this: I try to come to terms with my instincts and feelings.

When you say you want to destroy your empathy... Well, I dont know what can I tell you about that, but blaming everything ""worthless"" in you to an ""empathy instinct"" seems quiet decadent, as Nietzsche would say.

But also, he has this famous quote: ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"".

So i would say, in Nietzschean terms, do whatever you want, as long as you dont die.

Hope my empty advice helped."

He could probably read and speak italian (not with the same skill as french and Germán), because he spent a lot of his time in Italy, and he should have been a máster at reading and comprehending ancient greek and latín, for he was a phylologyst, that was his job."

I'm south American and maybe that's the reason why the test doesn't work on me.

But anyways, i dont feel part of any stereotype. I think the descriptions are sometimes too specific.

Like, for example, one INFJ trait is knowing stuff without any reason. I have this too, but when someone asks me why i know that certain thing, i can make up reasons for it really easily."
