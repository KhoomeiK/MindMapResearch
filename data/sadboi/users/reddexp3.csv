Advice,evli4g9,t3_ck1tr7,1564594980.0,"I've suffered from bad memories for my whole life. Yet during this summer I've managed to become relatively flashback free.

Some things that I've found doesn't work:

* Rationalizing
* ""Trying"" to forget
* ""Trying"" to not think about them
* Basically all ""mental tricks"" - I've had such a strong stuck thoughts and memories that nothing helped. They were OCD level shit

What worked:

* My worst memories were about people I knew. I put on my big boy pants and reached out with the intention of appreciating them and wishing them good for the rest of their lives. If they shared something, I took an understanding tone. Something clicked in my subconscious after this and I stopped having angry thoughts related to them.
* Lifestyle changes -- new hobbies, exercising sometimes
* With the rest of crappy memories -- this is not a joke btw and should be seriously considered if you're male -- I stopped watching porn and masturbating. After about 30 days of not masturbating, I simply didn't care that much anymore. And you know what your brain does to things it doesn't care about? It forgets. It's one of the best things I've done. The emotional stability I experienced afterwards was something I've never experienced."

CasualConversation,evfnkdi,t3_cjss2c,1564498450.0,"Well, I'm still looking for ways to find more friends myself, but the most important factor is repeated exposure to same people. If you're an adult that means either a weekly hobby, a job or something similar..

I hoped to meet people randomly for years but I had to admit that it just doesn't work like that. You can have amazing time for one night but if there's no good reasons to reach out after that then that's it.

I'm personally going back to school in this fall so I've got that going on for me. I hope everything goes well."

SuicideWatch,evfljtk,t3_cjr6kh,1564497547.0,"I don't feel you're seeking attention. What's the difference between seeking attention and expressing yourself anyways? I don't think there's any. It's just semantics.

You could say that every single person posting something on reddit or instagram or even speaking out loud attention seeker.. Or you could say they are just expressing themselves.

I've personally stopped caring whether people are better than me in some things.. It just doesn't have much meaning to me, but I understand your point of view too.

You know what? I don't think what you wrote is meaningless carbage because I got inspired to write something back. I got ideas that I wouldn't have been reminded without you posting something.

You can never know how what you do affects other people. You can just do and hope for the best."
SuicideWatch,evfk8dn,t3_cjrfx0,1564496999.0,"I understand everything feels impossible when you're depressed. I also understand feeling like a loser. You are definitely playing life on a bit harder mode than many other people.

I can't say what to do, but I can only say that I've seen many successful shorter people because they compensate with stronger personality. They just roll with the punches and suddenly everything is cool.. I've heard at some point that the more open you are about something the less people care about it.."
SuicideWatch,evfinqc,t3_cjrnn3,1564496348.0,"I feel you've been through way too much. I understand if all of what you've experienced feels too unbearable. 

What I've learned over the years is that despite having suicidal thoughts the only constant in life is change. Things change even if it doesn't feel like it. Sometimes it requires us to change, sometimes our situation changes. Sometimes things just require some time.

The only thing I ask if there's anything else you could try before making the final decision. It could be literally anything, because when you leave this world nothing matters anyways."

I appreciate that you have so much good in your soul that you're thinking of wanting to give your life and organs to other people. That means a lot in my book.

Is it possible to channel this desire to do good to others while you're alive and taking care of yourself? I understand if that's too much to be suggested."

SuicideWatch,evclzxk,t3_cjcp7x,1564418204.0,"I'm not going to say it will get better because it necessarily won't.

When I was 13 I went through a lot of bullshit. In hindsight, things went even worse after a while before turning better, yet I do remember experiencing some genuinely nice things during shitty times too. Those nice things were always a result of trying something different.

I don't know what you're going through yet I see it's something bad and I understand. It feels like shit. 

It feels like it's never going to get better, but I personally like to try to exhaust all my options before doing something that irreversible."
SuicideWatch,evck10q,t3_cjcq22,1564416972.0,"I feel like I understand how you feel. It's tough. I don't think there's no point to anything. I don't believe anyone really knows what's going on. People just know what's going on in their own lives and not much else.

None of us asked for this shit. We were just brought here without having a choice in the matter.

I imagine the environment you were brought up in was way shittier than the average persons. How could that be your fault? The playing field isn't level to begin with.

You could blame other people, you could blame yourself. I've done these things for years before I tried to let go.

We can either clock out or try to find ways to try to do something differently. I'm still trying different things in hopes of finding something that works.. For now."
CasualConversation,evcibbo,t3_cjcwrf,1564415863.0,"Wooow I remember watching it around when it first started to come out. I feel like around that time was the golden age of TV tho I'm aware that it's probably just good old nostalgia on my part. 

* House, Entourage in 2004
* How I met your mother, Prison break s1 in 2005
* Heroes, Dexter, Psych in 2006 
* Californication 2007

You get what I mean. I don't have many good memories from back then, but thinking of all the good TV series really brought back some.

I agree, the first season was amazing. I'd love to be as engaged with a TV series as I was back then."
CasualConversation,evcam6z,t3_cjacft,1564410694.0,"I follow my mood on daily basis with daylio, here's some insight:
This year I've had

68 good days
140 ok days
55 not ok days
15 bad days
1 terrible day

Most of the time I feel emotionally numb, but everything is relative. For me if I haven't felt particularly crappy, it's an ok day.

On the other hand a bad day really is a bad day. Terrible day is fetal position plus intense ""living is not worth it"" kind of thoughts.

So perhaps for someone else my ok day would be a bad day so they'd need more stimulation to feel better while I get by with less.

Good day means that I might have felt or did something that was kinda fun. I don't remember when's the last time I felt that intense fun or excitement I felt as a kid. Maybe that's just part of growing up (29 soon) and simply getting too used to being alive.

The funny thing is, if I hadn't had this data on hand, I'd have said that I'm not ok most days. The emotional numbness makes me have thoughts of letting go of this world fairly regularly. Yet the data seems to tell a different story.

The only thing I can say for certain is that things change. Everyone tries to get by. Appearances lie. Hell, even your own memory might lie."
CasualConversation,evc8ix4,t3_cjbh2t,1564409183.0,"I understand how you feel. I'm turning 29 soon and I feel I've gone through similar things. The biggest thing I regret about my 20's is that I didn't go to school after high school because the most important ingredient for making friends is repeated exposure to the same people.

One thing I've learned over the years is that nothing is like we think it is unless we've experienced it. You can never put into words and tell someone what a relationship is like because something always gets omitted. Not to mention that because everyone is different, every relationship is different too. 

This could be an opportunity for you try to make yourself happy by any means necessary.

I hope the best for you and I believe you're not alone with what you're experiencing.."
CasualConversation,evc76bo,t3_cjbc8m,1564408164.0,"I feel that's normal.. We just don't see or hear other people experiencing this stuff.

I limited personal social media usage to minimum and I'm way better for it. There's something super stressing about it that I haven't been able to get rid of via rationalization. I'm not saying this is what you should do, but it works for me.

I do understand if it's too important to let go of or get your mind off of it for a while."

AskReddit,evc5yya,t3_cjb524,1564407244.0,"Most importantly I'd focus on raising kids who are emotionally well off, not materially. I wouldn't want them to be or feel poor either, but I'd try to figure out the fine line between giving everything they want and having nothing.

I'd want to provide wide range of experiences and outdoor activities and limit the usage of screens (smartphone, tv, pc etc.)

I'd find ways for them to be exposed to other kids for social skills to develop properly.

I'd want them to have skills to become independent adults.

There's probably more, but I feel these are the most important ones."

I think you can reassure people despite not feeling like it. In fact if it's something you've never done, it could be worth it to just push through it and try it out.

The only thing I really feel nowadays is tiredness. When I was in a worse place than now, I got some comfort from the thought of ending everything, but nowadays those thoughts are akin to thinking about what I'd eat for dinner. It's an improvement for sure, but the thoughts never really went away."

CasualConversation,evc289p,t3_cj7w7w,1564404067.0,"I grew up in a judgemental and hateful environment. When you grow up in such an environment, it becomes ""normal"" to a kid. You only start to notice that something is wrong when you start to experience conflicts with most people, you develop some personality disorders and life sucks and you have no idea why. You know you are an asshole, yet whenever you try to change your brain just reverts to what it knows best because it's so uncomfortable.

I've put some serious effort to getting rid of these parts of my personality and I've made some great progress. Yet I'm afraid that the effort I put in never turns into something that's automatic like it would be for someone to grow up in a loving, emotionally healthy family.

I'd imagine all the hatred, judgmental people in the world being unlucky to grow up in such environment. It doesn't happen in isolation. People who are abused, abuse.

The worst part is that no one from the outside can't help hateful and judgemental people. Change has to happen from the inside when the discomfort of changing becomes less uncomfortable than feeling constant despair.

Honestly, when I see hateful and judgemental people who are old, it makes me sad because I can't imagine living like that for that long. I wish I could feel upset, but maybe I've ran out of that? Now there's mostly numbness.."
CasualConversation,evc0n6d,t3_cja9fq,1564402549.0,"For me it was a conscious choice to talk to myself out loud because I wanted to improve my expressivity.

I wish I'd be able to have conversations with myself without it requiring so much effort. The only thing that happens to me automatically is that my mind replays past conversations or tries to pre-think convos that have yet to happen.

I don't think your experience is crazy by any means. The brain has many different systems that can be in conflict with each other so discussing with ""yourself"" could be just different regions interacting.

What is ""you"" anyways? When I started to pay attention to how much of my life happens by autopilot, I saw it's mostly subconscious. It's kind of freaky when you start to think about it and it might even make you question who you are.

Yep I feel it's time for me to check out, I wish good day for you :)"

SuicideWatch,evbyz44,t3_cj0tqt,1564400791.0," Agree, nothing matters. 

The system sucks. There's no compassion to be expected in a system of any kind. Compassion can be found only when you stir the right emotions in people, but that's the problem: what makes me think of suicide is precisely the inherent lack of emotions. It could almost be described as boredom that doesn't go away and you want to die because of it.

I've found it reasonable to stop playing along and to stop trying to appease. I'm nowadays just trying to focus on anything that might amuse me. It's tough, but it still keeps my heart beating.

Everything's not going to be ok because we're all going to die. For some it's going to be way less pleasant than others.

I've found news and all the bullshit that's going on around the world has very little value. The stories stay the same but the people change. It's insanity, yet I'm starting to see that people are becoming disillusioned with its inherent bullshit.

I too feel that having to go decades more doesn't sound appealing.

It's honestly sad if you decide to end it, but I understand completely. Somehow I still manage to stay in this game of life because I still feel I haven't exhausted all the options there are. When thinking about the nothingness afterwards where I simply don't exist and nothing that happened never even mattered, I'm still entertaining the idea that some other kind of life might be possible.. I hope this could be true for you too."
