KimetsuNoYaiba,fquexeq,t1_fqkvyy9,1589657696.0,"Tbh I'm just pretending that the reincarnation thing isn't real and they really just are their grandkids. I hate the idea of reincarnation couples being siblings, it's weird. It also doesn't make sense since some of them have opposite personalities of the souls they're supposed to be. On top of that I'd prefer the og gang is in heaven together, that makes the most sense anyway since they literally said heaven AND reincarnation is real. I'm not a fan of this ending for allot of reasons, it's just not my cup of tea. I have yet to like a shonen ending and I'm honestly not touching them anymore after bnha ends. They either drag it out and ruin the vibe for me (Naruto) push ships and love triangles and try to force me to like terribly written characters (bleech) or don't tie everything up and leave me feeling disappointed (kny) I know I sound bitchy but I'm not wasting hours of my life anymore if they don't end right. I loved kny, and respect croc sensei, but I feel like it should have just ended at 204. Why show them in heaven being happy but then have them reincarnate? It's contradictory. Just my imo, I have nothing against anyone who likes it or the people who worked on it. Just bums me out I guess."

Everyone though I was sweet, polite, and wanted me as a daughter, but didn't realize that every day I was walking on eggshells making sure that was the only way I would act.

You look fine, and In the future you can do things to make yourself attractive. Men can wear makeup (I don't mind anyway) work out, grow a beard, get a new haircut, Ect. On top of that a lot of of people care more about attention and personality traits than anything. I had a crush on a kid with a lopsided face and greasy hair once because he was nice to me, and when I was a teen on a guy covered with volcano red acne. If you take care of yourself and act like a decent person you'll grown into a handsome man no matter what your physical features are.

I got lucky, he's been alone with my cousin allot and i worry about her. but no, nobody saw this as a red flag. only me, my mom, and my brother. that's just the tip of the iceberg sadly anyway. i'm pretty sure he did things to my father/uncle too, which would explain allot. my grandma who divorced him and hated him even told my mom that he thought children were attractive. my father is weird like him but not as bad. the truama i have from that family is so weird most people don't even believe me."

CPTSD,fmyrcn0,t3_fy5qmx,1586493492.0,Yessss I'm everyone's free therapist and emotional punching bag so I get this 10000 %. It sucks. And it's the reason why I've contemplated suicide so often. It's overwhelming to me when people treat me like a human worth more than just heavy lifting and a venting booth. I'm not used to being loved without strings attached.
AskWomen,fmxwv23,t1_fmwmo6a,1586473459.0,"I have it too apparently although my mom isn't a teacher and neither are I, but I was watching a friends kid one day and he hit me smack dab on my eye, I must of looked like I was on the brink of murder bc he deadass looked like I was about to sell him to the devil 😂"
CPTSD,fmxaf86,t3_fxtkm4,1586461385.0,"I have a reallyyyyyy hard time replying to all messages, on reddit, insta, messenger ect. I'm not sure why but maybe it has to do with trauma like you mentioned.... I feel bad about it too... When I reached out to my best friend from childhood a year ago he pretty much just brushed me off politely and since then I just don't even like to bother, I feel like I'm too much or I'm just going to get my hopes up."

I wish I could :( But thank you for the advice :) I'm hoping to get a job when all of this is over and start a new life, until then I'll just have to deal.... I'm looking forward to being my own person and calling the shots though, I've wanted that since I was little."

I loved the melencholy 70s mystical vibe to it and genes sarcasm was the cherry on top. Just more mysterious and fun imo. I watched it with my mom last night again and holy crap is it a wild ride for a children's movie."
offmychest,fmqcgqk,t1_fmouieg,1586297019.0,"I often feel like a lone wolf I'm my house, yet I have the least privacy and our walls are paper thin. I love to draw, read, watch anime Ect but I don't even try to do it most of the time because ""HEYYY YOUR DOG NEEDS TO GO OUT! IM HUNGRY MAKE ME SOMETHING!!! HHEYYY IM GONNA SCREAM AT YOU FOR NO REASON! I leave everyone alone but they can't do the same for me. It's infuriating. The only time I get alone time is when everyones asleep. I'm about ready to strangle my family."

And yes, that does make sense. anytime i ask for help from people in my real life they either ignore me or fix the problem for me and act like i made the biggest mistake in the world... so if i can fix something by myself i want to, and i'm happy that when i'm spiraling i can go on reddit and somebody can probably help me without judgment. thanks again!!!"
