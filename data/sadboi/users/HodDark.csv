You are not bad for telling on her, they need to know she has been purging. No, you are the asshole for your attitude to her. Some of it IS attention seeking, she's TWELVE and clearly you seek attention too because teenagers are like that, but that is secondary to the issue. 

Your little sister is slowly killing herself and her teeth. No one in your household is supporting her properly and trying to make her better. She needs someone to convince her it is alright to eat and keep it down. Not scold her for weakness and make her just need more control. 

Read up. Try to help. Or tell your parents they need to actually go to an eating disorder specialist about it online. With the pandemic and this being a 12 year old, it'll get worse before it gets better."

I don't identify with Joker. Or with Harley. But I can understand the charm. People identify with the disorder and with their vulnerability. Very rarely their villany. If it were simply a matter of identifting with the villany then yeah. 

But harley is a therapist manipulated by a charming sociopath into an abusive relationship. She was always the one to try to find a sense of normalcy for her severely messed up partner. This caused her to fall to his level of crazy but she has always been the better one. Why Batman has always tried to talk her out of her situation. But she loves Joker and wants to stay with him to help him. Sound familiar?

And Joker has flashes of being an abuser. But he is kinder to Harley then to snyone else. He does truly love her but his own personal issues males it difficult to not by his very existence hurt her. 

Harley is not completely a victim. Joker is not completely the flawed abuser. But people can identify with their elements of good and with their relationship when it's good. Their relationship is a passionate, firey two maniac pixie girls relationship when good. 

You can also be sympathetic. Harley is brilliant. She's kind. She is a great listener to her friends and thinks deeply on issues. But Joker is a bad habit she can't kick. She can't save him but the romanticm is in when it is working. When she does save him for a time. 

People are not assholes for wanting hope. For wanting the quirky that can handle them. Anyone can feel like a monster controlled by their disorder like Joker. Or the helper like Harley.

Personally with these types i feel it speaks to their disorder in their life. The chaos they hope they can find someone to save them from. And that is sad. But doesn't make them monsters."

Your In Laws suck. No lie. They shouldn't force a non-dog person to be a dog person.

Though you'd be interested to hear Portuguese people actually get offended being called White and that might actually mess up your survey if you are trying to get accurate data. Now to get into the CMV where I give you more info for your view but don't necessarily change it.

Now on Black/African American. I'll give you a bit of history as a sociology major though accuracy may vary because it's been years since I was in uni. African American as a term mostly came about because America had a bunch of slaves without an identity besides Black and Black was negative due to the colored separations. They didn't really have a cultural heritage. So a lot of them, meaning groups in New York mostly, became attached to the idea of reconnecting to their cultural heritage. Since most slaves in the slave trade were from Africa... Well... African American. 

Modern times there are a few problems with this. I'll discuss this now as a Canadian whose knowledge of this is from American culture bleeding here which is tinted a little by our own cultural heritage. We have both native black populations, meaning populations that came here via the slave trade or immigrated here there naturalized as Canadian, who prefer Black. We have people who immigrated here who prefer accurate to their culture, such as Jamaican-Canadians who get veeeery offended if you call them African-Canadian or Afro-Canadians (Afro was an older term that occassionally sometimes comes up). Then there are those who are perfectly fine with African American who either come from the US or are a part of this cultural bleed. 

Note that this encompasses several different groups which makes it very hard for person to person interaction. But our government data tends to prefer White, Black, POC unspecified, Native American, Asian and Mixed as classifications for that reason. When it's broad swath populations, it is more respectful. When it is more specific a survey then what you are doing, you should know your populations of the area so you can do more specific. Both Black and African American can be accurate depending on circumstances.

To my specific commentary on your situation... Might this be an oversight? Maybe because the client is black or thinks that the survey might only be able to get local black population data via the use of the term African American? Suggest to them that depending on the depth of the survey, the accuracy of the survey may decrease with immigrant populations if you switch the term to African American. Or offer to do both. You'll get some African American naturalized citizens but if you do Black and African American it might cover the populations they are trying to look into."

Once when he was really sick as a puppy he peed in the tub because he couldn't wake my parents and was so distressed about peeing on the carpet. Even if we could keep him longer, it'd be cruel then. 

Your dogs are a little dotty but trucking on so it's not cruel to take your time with the decision. But the fact you are taking care of young kids and the dogs is something to be considered. If their quality of life is lessened enough and you think worse would be at a point it'd be more traumatizing for them to go then then to go earlier... I do think it is a good idea to walk your husband through it and maybe make a list of when would be a good point. If he wants to be able to say goodbye. 

Hell... A final meal too. It might help if he knows they can at least get a good sending off."
AmItheAsshole,f9ijly0,t1_f9i2lgu,1575338731.0,"Related, and I like your list but I just want to add a point, what your pet considers important that would stress them to lose. My childhood dog was set to be put down as soon as he lost integrity of his prostate. When my dog was a puppy and very very sick he was so distressed at the idea of peeing himself indoors that he peed in the tub. He couldn't wake our parents so he did that instead. We were amazed at his intelligence. So when he could not hold his pee anymore he was incredibly distressed.

We waited so my brother could say goodbye, a decision I'm glad my parents decided on since Max wanted to see my brother too before he went but I was too focused on his suffering as the one who had cared for him those last months when he didn't have as much mobility but was still enjoying life, but he was not in pain long and I find it is the greatest kindness we can do to make sure they do not have to suffer longer than they have to. 

And don't feel guilty if you think it's a little late. To your dogs this is as bad as they think it is going to get. So you still prevent them from dealing with worse."

 His widow is his **widow**. They did not divorce. There was no negativity. He **died** and likely your mother's showering all this attention on them as what is left of your brother. And was the widow expected to stay single the whole time for her to stay eligible to any sort of inheritance for being someone who brought happiness into your brother's life before he died?

Y-W-B-T-A if you press it too much. People cope with grief in their own way and it doesn't sound like she plans to leave you out of the will. It just sounds like she is spending more of **her** money then you'd like while she is living and plans to leave more of **her** money then you expect when she dies. Re-evaluate if your mother is having a hard time living spending so much. But even you say it's within her means."

It's perfectly valid, particularly since you don't know what the fight is about and she won't have her own space to leave to for a whole week. 

Maybe even be willing to give her an out or just lessen the time she spends over? I'd suggest maybe Christmas Eve and Christmas day? Just tell her because you don't know the circumstances of the fight with her brother you really don't want to have her feel trapped."
AmItheAsshole,f9iekob,t3_e55163,1575335194.0,"NAH, you are supplying a place for her to sleep and you actually did try to ask her about the fight with her brother. Considering the expanded circumstances, some of this may be some leftover resentment. On the other hand, she's in the right to have some resentment. Particularly since not only are you expecting her to sleep in the living room visiting family... You are expecting her and her fiance to.

You're asking too much for someone's personal space. And considering her brother is having the issues he is from quitting smoking on top of that along with those unresolved issues. Well... I honestly agree with the suggestion that you should be the one sleeping on the couch so she could have her own personal space away from her brother. But you don't really have to and she is also not obligated to spend time with family for the sake of family and accept conditions she doesn't like.

Although I find neither of you the asshole, this is really one of those situations where either side can find the other the asshole. With more context it might be tipped one way or the other. Just be there for her. She was honest enough even if she doesn't want to go into it. Maybe ask if she is willing to compromise a little because you still want her to visit even if she's upset? It doesn't have to be the whole week or with sleeping over at your house does it?"

treelaw,f83k5l6,t3_dyh6au,1574213842.0,"I think view enhancement can help with picking which trees you deal with for cutting on trimming. I think Yosemite park was alright because as much as it was for views, it's also easier and safer to maintain a forest with less trees. 

Trees are always in competition over resources. So too many close together could harm each other. Too dense can also make for more of a hazard with the leaves and the forest floor. On top of that... If humans were the reason the conditions became stable for trees to encroach on the meadows in the first place, I think ordinarily meadows don't get invaded by trees because it's not a good place for them to grow. If we wrecked the balance we need to take the place of the balance. 

On the other hand... Trees can be a view too. I think you need to think about which trees to cut. I have a soft spot for trees because we have a building philosophy in Ontario to just leave patches of small forest as trails and where wild animals can live and go through that are too small to be preserves. Just my thoughts on it."
changemyview,f7qg7yv,t1_f7q61dv,1573963458.0,"I fundamentally disagree with that view. And here's why. 

There are people who would rather die then hurt someone. This is sonething that happens as often as the opposite. Lying. Cheating. Stealing all happen to a minor degree but not with everyone. 

But when it comes to larger crimes. Often times it is trauma and mental illness. Do you know criminals have higher instances of family dysfunction? The ones that do not highly tint to money crimes. 

Why is a criminal record check a viable check? because only the most impulsive people, trashy ones, are likely to actually commit a crime like those you listed without mental illness. Twisted people exist...

But not even APD suffering people, psychopaths, are all criminals. Schizoid explains one serial killer who was a complete monster but as soneone with schizoid personality disorder i could never harm a person. 

I find that it is not the case any person could become a criminal. It's a spiral. Often times by factors, desperation and genetic circumstance. 

It takes a village to raise a child. Those without chance or guidence, proper guidence, become criminals. Otherwise society would be game of thrones."

changemyview,f7q5djw,t3_dxg6rt,1573959026.0,"The flaw in your thinking is that it's a way to dismiss responsibility from the person. In news it's meant to try to understand. It's incomprehensible to the average person that someone could have that line of logic and be healthy. I actually agree people like to not think about the fact humanity has that inherently violent side. Not everyone will be violent but that dark and violent side served us well in the past. But people are curious. They want to know if it was something abnormal with their logic, their nurture or their biology. 

But I want to also counter. There are, in fact, circumstances where mental illness is a factor. The bath salt incident when looked at by Dr. Phil seems like the dude actually went through a psychotic break. No drugs in his system. The media just thought he had drugs. Schizophrenia and other psychosis disorders that are sometimes violent are one of humanity's oldest ticking time bombs. Mostly benign but paranoid schizophrenia can be terrifying. 

Untreated Borderline Personality Disorder and Histrionic personality disorder leads to a lot of violent behavior. Personality disorders can have a biological or nurture basis so I'm throwing that in. Post Pardum Psychosis is a very serious disorder that has led to multiple women murdering their children. Often thinking in a disordered thought it was the right thing to do. The news on it has led to doctors looking for and treating it before these occurrences happen, leading to them happening less often. 

Also did you know that people suffering from dementia can be violent without meaning to? Go from nice people to absolute monsters at the end. The opposite happens too but something that messes with brain chemistry can do that. 

Also look up what happens to people hit in the frontal lobe. Lack of impulse control. Anger issues. Mood swings. Someone with any sort of mercury or heavy metal poisoning also has similar symptoms along with anxiety and heart problems."
changemyview,f7pyz3b,t1_f7p6zhy,1573956456.0,"How do you explain the ones that happen without any knowledge of a situation then? I'm curious. 

An example is I was playing with dolls in my cousin's room, she left to the washroom. Little after she did the rocking chair rocked on it's own. It felt like the presence of an old man to me just smiling warmly. My cousin walked in and freaked, it stopped slowly while we were looking. My aunt asked later of a neighbor and it turned out an old man died in my cousin's room in his rocking chair. Never happened again because my cousin refused to keep the, not used by the ghost in life rocking chair, in her room."
changemyview,f7pwd1x,t1_f7pqjmt,1573955392.0,"There are a few problems with your point. One is that a lot of people with ghost experiences don't necessarily have mental illness or those who commonly has ghost experiences. We have just as many experiences of strangers having ghost stories where they learn about someone and find something (Story or physical item) as of people visited by ancestors. 

For another, although the cultural experiences of death may be different.. There's a lot of consistent points for where ghosts come up in experiences. Tragic Death, Death in war/large scale catastrophe and visitation. All of these have the common rules of strong emotion. All of them don't have everyone in a group experiencing it unless it is a very strong place. Strong experiences happen with relatives but they are brief. Some cultures consider this good. Some consider it bad. 

Ghosts don't necessarily have to break a taboo. Ghosts don't have rhyme or reason as to whether they stick around besides strong emotion. Isn't it strange although the myth has a cultural flavor, sometimes with behavior or a religious tint, the rules of a ghost are that consistent?

Still another.... You don't hear or see anything. Do your friends? Do other people? Does it have a consistent history? Are there particular triggers you either disregarded or kept to to not cause trouble? Just as there are people who see ghosts, there are those who don't seem to have the physical capability. I'm not one of them though I feel things. You can read my short list of stories to OP.  It's also possible all the ghosts have faded, there seems to be very few places with ghosts that go beyond a certain number of years. I don't know why.

Humans don't study ghosts because they aren't considered real. But story wise I find that it is very rare for castles to have more than a few *residents* even with a lot of death. Very rare for ghosts of several hundred years to stick around and to even care about people coming by. That could be another explanation. You either have to be very interesting or mess up very badly to see a ghost that old. Not every place is haunted and we don't know why for that either. 

Btw I don't take anything personally. I am fascinated and terrified of the supernatural. So I know a few stories. Just countering. I joined precisely to add my ghost agnostic but wanting to believe they are possible butt into the convo."
changemyview,f7pr5eg,t1_f7phsof,1573953306.0,"Not a problem! Elephants are a good demonstration we don't always think of looking if we think we know everything.

The primary thing with my ghost experiences that makes me call them not interesting is you can arguably find natural explanations for most of them. The rocking chair one is my most ""real"" one because not only did my cousin also see it start up and stop but my aunt was the one who asked about the background with it. But for more detail, I think I more sense rather than see anything. But I have had physical phenomena happen twice, auditory once and one thing that was just strange.

Besides the rocking chair, when my childhood cat died I was *distraught* and crying on the top bunk of my bed. I couldn't get to sleep. While I was looking at the ladder part of my bed, the blanket flattened in the shape of my black cat. He was fat so it was of a particular roundness. When I touched the spot I felt a sudden wave of calm and fell asleep. He was afraid of height thanks to my Dad throwing him for a picture when he was a kitten, I only managed to get him up there once after a lot of coaxing, so I saw this as a goodbye and ""I'm not scared anymore"" thing. People pointed out I could have been sleeping.

The two stranger experiences... One was in my old house. A few months before we moved out, on my way to sleep, I heard a mature (read 50s ish) female voice say ""Get out!"" loudly and clearly in my ear. I was immediately tense hearing it but didn't fully wake up so I just went fully to sleep. To be polite, I told her we were moving soon and please be patient when I woke up. I'm afraid of ghosts so if I think I feel something I am very polite to them and tell them I am afraid. It could be an auditory hallucination, a person can have one of those randomly even without schizophrenia, but the nervous energy from the move could have woke her up too. No one to corroborate

The other is my current house I thought I caught a flash of yellow fabric, walking  past me in the dark on my way to my room. But I have never seen her since. That one, if I take a guess, would be a woman/girl because it seemed like a dress. No way it was light because all the doors were closed and there are no windows in the hallway. That one I have no clue.

Besides that I am uncomfortable with cemeteries and the one time I saw mist over graves of a old Mennonite graveyard near my old house on a day when mist was unlikely. Mist no one else in the car saw."
changemyview,f7pas1d,t3_dxc255,1573946565.0,"Alright... I can throw in some two cents here! Did you know elephants can communicate at lower frequencies then we do? And that Mantis shrimp, I think that's them, can see more than we can? Do you know how much program and tech is necessary to compensate for just the regular errors in film in the first place? More and more we get clearer filters and different ways of detecting. 

There was an interesting point when on a Nuke's top five, I think, one of the video clips had a guy trying to face track and it caught a face nearby him but there was no actual face there other than the outline. Some things are fakeable but I find some things on the internet are really compelling. Then there's also... 

One of the things I always hate people not doing is not visiting some of the more haunted places we know have high sightings with those cameras. Some are dangerous. But the manor with the grey lady... There are a lot of signs of her and her power. She's frequent. There are places with predictable phenomena people seem too scared to film. I personally err on the more agnostic side of things but it's more or less because...

Nearly every culture has evidence, written evidence that could not be written by any other culture, of the dead having some type of shape. Either being stuck on a battlefield, vengeful or brief glimmers of comfort before going some place. Even though we have many ways it can be faked... I find it interesting how something like vampires has a specific source of the mythology but ghosts exist across cultures. To me that personally is why I am left agnostic. 

Well that and I have ghost experiences if you're interested but they aren't interesting. I don't really... See anything. But it was nothing I could have predicted or filmed. But that's a part of the problem. Most ghost experiences are that. The only exception was the rocking chair as to something I could have maybe replicated. At least the neighbors mentioned, independently with no details other than a rocking chair just starting up on its own, that an old man died in my cousin's room. We did not get to test that though because my female cousin was understandably a little freaked. Ghosts don't seem to have a lot of energy though. Only old ones, like the Grey Lady, or rare ones are exceptions. 

Tl;DR: Agreed on no tech yet for filming it though some of the tech stuff is compelling. Added a mention of my personal annoyance no one goes to the really haunted places that often have physical manifestations. Also think it significant ghosts are a cross culture phenomena with no identifiable origin even if they have different manifestations of similar rules. I have ghost stories if you want to hear too.
