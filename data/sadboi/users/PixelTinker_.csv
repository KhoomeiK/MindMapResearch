Christianity,f01tm5c,t1_f01qsvy,1568318817.0,"Also it’s funny how you say “it’s unbecoming to attempt to rebuke a believer on the premise of not reading the Bible” because you literally were throwing stuff at me out of the Bible about what I believe and belittling my belief lolol. I am also repeating what the Bible says. I am not belittling you for not reading the Bible, the point I am trying to make is that you sit here and act like you know everything...I’m just letting you know that you don’t and because you obviously don’t read the Bible you can’t try and prove your points to me when you’re not very educated. You’re the one arguing with me about my beliefs to begin with and trying to correct me? I didn’t ask for how anybody feels about anything or a lecture of who’s right and who’s wrong but just some damn advice."

You are assuming that above everything else. There could have been multiple other questions you asked me but that’s the one thing you assumed I might be doing. It is an assumption
Christianity,f01o0id,t1_f01n86f,1568316914.0,My point is not about how hard life has been but that you just assume that I’m sleeping with my boyfriend because I live with him. That is the point I’m trying to make.

Christianity,f01kcbf,t1_f01k08n,1568315665.0,Yeah that’s my point. I am not judging but you are. I haven’t set any standards I am going by what I’ve learned through his word. It’s called sharing my knowledge along so people like you aren’t so ignorant in the future.
Christianity,f01k47k,t1_f01ijqe,1568315594.0,You have no idea of my living situation or if I ever had anybody there to raise me. What if he took me in because I had nowhere else to go and it’s not about sex! You really shouldn’t assume things.
Christianity,f01jwjs,t1_f01ijqe,1568315526.0,who ever said I am sleeping with anybody? Hahah you just assumed that. Also are you Christian? If so who are you to judge? People sin everyday. That’s just a part of human nature but you shouldn’t be the first one to cast a stone when you’re just as guilty.
Christianity,f01jn3a,t1_f01ikn8,1568315438.0,I do in fact worship him everyday but not to the extent I need to in order to build a stronger bond with him. It’s kind of hard to focus  on work and on praising him.
Christianity,f01jh5g,t1_f01ikn8,1568315380.0,"It’s completely illegal to tell me I can’t work on Sunday’s because of religious beliefs. They could get in serious trouble. I’m sorry but I won’t have them take away the one day I can fully devote myself to HIM. And that’s the whole point is that everyday I’m busy with earthly things but to be with him ONE day out of the week means everything to my relationship with him. It is completely fair actually to have Sunday off. I’m not asking for the whole weekend off. If they can’t “reasonably accommodate that” then they will get in trouble point blank period. 
I’ve told them this from the beginning and if it’s going to be a big issue then they should have stated that in the first place before hiring me. That’s on them not on me."
Christianity,f01im00,t1_f01i2hp,1568315097.0,I definitely will approach it with prayer but it’s my right as an American citizen to live my life how I intend to and that is based around my religious beliefs. I will not bend to what they want because that’s taking away my precious time with him. I won’t have that taken away from me too.
Christianity,f01i3he,t1_f01hgqe,1568314927.0,I understand. Although it’s called I have to balance a full time job. I always keep HIM in my heart and work for him in a sense. Though having one day out of a full time schedule is not about sacrifice as you’ve stated it’s about getting closer to him.

Christianity,f01helx,t1_f01fj5y,1568314704.0,"Also what you asked in the beginning and what you’re saying now has no relevance to each other. Me “sleeping with my roommate” and then “not worshiping GOD every single day to where I have no work life” 
Hm seems off to me? It’s called balancing everything in my life. I also work for GOD in my own way. But you wouldn’t know that because you’re an uneducated swine who just assumes and judges people... bye"
Christianity,f01gw87,t1_f01fj5y,1568314535.0,"Excuse me? Lmao it’s called I have to balance a full time work life. 
I cannot sit around and worship GOD all day everyday otherwise I would be homeless. Believe me I still keep him in my thoughts all the time.

Christianity,f01ftgd,t1_f01dxpu,1568314181.0,"Believe me I do worship him all days, but since I have to work long hours it’s a bit hard to do so. Which is why most people have a specific day they can dedicate their entirety to."

I love the term sensitivity superhero though! You’ve given me a lot to think about. I needed a different perspective.

I am always being told that I’m beautiful and I shouldn’t feel self conscious, but people don’t know the whole story.
