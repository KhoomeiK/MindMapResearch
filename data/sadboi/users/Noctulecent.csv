Just about exploring different things to find what suits. It takes time as well, it took me forever to integrate more veg and stuff but it’s about flavouring it.

Potatoes are a god send, you can do a lot with them.
Same with apples (with things like peanut butter)"

I hope you’re in a better place OP."
sex,fhxhigg,t1_fhx18kl,1581954496.0,"Just to chime in, yes. I have agreed to oral before on an ex, but no deep throating. Let me be in control bc I was hurt bad in the past.

Ended up ripping my hair to make me deep throat, and I was sick.

That set the tone for the rest of the relationship. If he doesn’t listen, which, he already hasn’t might I add, he’s not going to listen in the future. You’re better off without him OP. No one deserves to feel like this - you did not consent."
CPTSD,fhuk81e,t3_f4r6nm,1581887301.0,"I view things very black and white. You’re either good or bad. It’s how I keep myself safe but it’s not great in the long run, because I could be punishing myself for a one off mistake."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fhskj7f,t1_fhrmmvr,1581862054.0,"You don’t know the circumstances though. 

For example - my dog doesn’t like you touching her tail and would growl when we first got her: turned out the person who had her before had it broken.

Now she trusts us, we can touch it. This could be a new dog that isn’t used to things, and that takes time. The owner set this up for failure. It isn’t the dogs fault."

AnimalsBeingJerks,fhixm3t,t1_fhit9c7,1581633882.0,"Some dogs are more tolerant than others. But people forget they are animals. They react, as animals would do in any situation. My two are both spaniels. They both have very different tolerances and personalities.

It’s also worth taking into consideration the background this dog had. Maybe the people let the child disrupt it instead of letting it sleep, maybe it had issues before that were not addressed. It’s not the dogs fault. 

My dog is very iffy about someone touching her tail because her previous owner tried to break it. So her reaction is understandable, but she doesn’t lash out cause she knows the people she trusts won’t do that.

It’s very circumstantial but the people who recorded this knew what would happen. This is how children get bitten and dogs put down."

The dog was startled.

I’d react the same way if someone suddenly fell beside me."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fhir5lg,t1_fhhkb4b,1581630199.0,"The dog was startled. Mine does the same if you startle them from sleep, it’s not something they can control. Although if they feel safe, it’s not as bad."

I went cutting deeper and the scars are bigger and more noticeable, and people look at you weird.

Plus you’re at more risk of cutting into something serious. 

I promise it’s not worth it."
