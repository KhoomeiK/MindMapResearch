I get symptoms here and there but it all works really well. HOWEVER, I didn’t know they were the right meds until I made drastic life style changes and put myself into a position that the meds could actually work. Meds are necessary for me but life style changes are critical and you cannot expect meds to work unless you’re willing to behave in the best way. And the life style changes can’t follow the meds they just give you the best chance of figuring out if the meds work. It’s all variable control. Eat right, exercise, get your sleep hygiene working well, and stabilize your behaviors. Then you know if the meds help or not because nothing else is out of whack"

Don’t use past that. I have friends that do use it for medical issues and then use it recreationally as well and that causes some issues for them because recreationally it masks problems and allows for escape.

BipolarReddit,f1x241v,t3_dausnj,1569792617.0,"I have bipolar disorder and I am also an alcoholic. I spent years thinking mental stability, my meds, and therapy would get me to the point I wouldn’t be an alcoholic. I’d be kinda stable and ok and the drinking would “improve” but eventually I’d just end up drinking more and more and I’d be completely thrown off mentally. About a year ago I decided to actively tackle the drinking as it’s own problem while also treating my mental health issues. I need my meds,  therapy, and routines for my mental health while also doing things to treat my addiction issues. It just happens there is a lot of crossover. 

Substance abuse can exist as it’s own problem beyond just a symptom of bipolar disorder. You have to treat both as their own issues and understand their interplay. 

Hard to get sober if you’re mentally unsound. Your mental stability can’t last if you’re mucking about up there.

Women like nice guys. That’s not true. Women like a lot of things and nice might be one of them but nice doesn’t make up for a lack of the others.

Always put her first. That’s fucking silly. You have to put your own minimal well being first. And the relationship follows. Not HER but the relationship. How do you best benefit both of you. 

Happy wife happy life. Maintaining a happy relationship definitely improves your life but that’s the relationship not your wife. You’re equal partners and it’s only a facet of life. 

A good women is hard to find. That’s.... hard to say as what is good is objective and also subjective. There’s good in many many people it’s just finding the right person that can be difficult. If anything the guy saying this is false is actually kinda hopeful.
