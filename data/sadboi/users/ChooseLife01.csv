Advice,f742y8y,t3_du61vz,1573397683.0,"Perhaps by way of combining some of the advice that has been given you could find a helpful course of action. Start with the positive approach, sitting down with them and talking to them as has been suggested by many users, avoiding anger. 

However, you need to plan for if this doesn‚Äôt work, whether it be because they seem to agree with you but don‚Äôt actually change their behaviour or because they refuse to listen to you outright. If this happens, I would tell them that you are thinking of contacting an animal welfare organisation (I‚Äôm not sure where you live, but I‚Äôm sure there will be a relevant one) because of your concerns. I think it would be wise to make it clear that this is not personal, and that your sole concern is for the well-being of the animals. 

You must bear in mind that they could react badly to this, because in some cases no matter how logical your reasoning, some people will always assume an ulterior motive. Because of this, I believe that it is up to you to make a judgement on how you think they will react, and whether or not you can cope with this reaction if it means animosity will exist between you. 

Essentially, to summarise, if they won‚Äôt listen when they explain nicely, weigh up whether the welfare of the animals is more important to you than an entirely amicable relationship with your (step)parents. I hope this was helpful :)"
