depression,fqbrie4,t3_gccld3,1589242513.0,"It hurts. But it is also good to be someones nr 3. I mean, they still love you? And ranking your friends is not really viable... It depends on so much more than your feelings. My nr 2 today can be my nr 5 in two months..

Your value is not defined by how fast other people respond to you."
depression,fqbpoa3,t3_g8eq07,1589241509.0,"Yes. I support  you going to Ireland for a while. This is an horrific thing you have had to endure.

I am sorry for you. And please remember that you are not alone. And if you feel a bit of hope, a sense of temporary relief, please do not feel that you disappoint her. You will always have a place for her in your heart.

The sorrow will always be with you. It will not fade. But as time goes on you will get to experience happy feelings again. Your heart will make room for more feelings. I am sure of this.

Please do take all of the professional help you are offered. This is to hard to fight on your own.

I believe in you. Go to Ireland. Talk to a phycologists. Experience nature. And live."

Talk to him about this! It is surely a big problem for him as well!"
AmItheAsshole,foi3oof,t1_foi266u,1587778073.0,"I do not agree with you. Absolutly it is a horrible thing to do to your partner. No question! I was trying to make the point that I feel that it is a bit strong to do this to someone that means a lot to you. You would probably get less prison time for manslaughter (where I am from) than the time that has passed since here father did this...And also, we do not know the whole story either. 

Absolutely though, it is really shitty to do this to your partner."
AmItheAsshole,foi0pr2,t3_g7fdye,1587776350.0,"YTA. How long ago was it? 12-17 years? Has he been a good father to you?

Everyone makes mistakes. And I firmly believe that one should not be dis-invited to your childs wedding for it. Your mom choose to prioritize her mental health before your wishes. That's fine. But I do not think that you are in the position to judge your father for it. Do you know the whole picture? Have you spoken to him about this and how repulsed you are about it?

Absolutely it is okay to be upset about something this significant. Definitely ! But I think that you are extracting some kind of vengeance that is not yours. He did not do this to you. He did it to your mother, years ago. And you have no way of knowing if your life would have been better if he did not do it.

So definitely OP, you are the asshole here. Sorry."

I can not really figure out how you did the outlines of the eyes? It looks so blended with the white yarn and I can not wrap my head around this and how you managed to make it so realistic. It really looks like blended makeup!

Please share your ""blending"" technique if you have the time!"

AmItheAsshole,fcykvk2,t3_ejfavh,1578081861.0,"NTA!

If it was reversed, and the groom wanted all of the groomsmen to wear dresses, everyone would understand that some of the men would not accept the dresscode! I really do not understand why this need to be any different just because you do not wear typically female clothing.

I would tell my sister that you could still come and do the shopping for dresses, but not shop for yourself. And that you afterwards can send her some examples of jumpsuits or something that you would be okay wearing. It might be possible to find a compromise! The same colour and material but long shorts and a nice sleeveless shirt? I dunno.

Maybe it could also be a good idea to ask her again why it is so important the amount of fabric around your body? It might be something else than just the pictures that she is anxious about?

Yeah, I dunno. But definetly NTA, you get to choose what you want and what you do not want to wear."
confessions,fciqwyo,t1_fbxhzej,1577667690.0,"Ive read it all! Wish you all the best for your future.

Reading your post I also got a feeling that it might be interesting for you to explore if an autism/asperger diagnosis is something that can give you some answers about your behaviour. ADHD and autism are closely related and your difficulties regarding other people might be, in part, because of some degree of autism.

I hope you do not take this the wrong way, I really so not mean anything by it. Just a thought that came to me while reading.

I am sorry for your upbringing and everything you had to go through. You are strong. Never forget that!"

He often asks me how I want him to behave, but it is quite hard to explain to him"
relationships,f0u3679,t1_f0tz694,1568933322.0,I have also had this thought. But I do really think that he cares for me and tries to be a good friend. He just isn't very good at it...

You are probably right about his behaviour. He has told me that in his family they always have very heated and loud arguments, ""because that is how you do it""."
