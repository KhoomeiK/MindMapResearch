TalkTherapy,f9pb0uj,t1_f9olarb,1575527856.0,"I answered some of your questions in my response to u/catemination, specifically on whether we could infer our therapist's cultural views in conversations that are not explicitly focused on them. But you raise an additional concern about whether it is possible to know how another individual think or feel internally, given that we don't have access to their internal world. But actually, in real life, we make this kind of statement/judgement all the time, because we infer motivation or assume intention of another person based on observable behaviors. For example, we might say ""XXX doesn't care"" ""XXX is full of themselves"" or ""XXX feels like they know everything"". Obviously we don't really know what's going on in their mind, but we make that inference based on our continuing interactions. The reason we wanted to include these items is because assessing humility involves the inference of intention (intra-personal), in addition to the behaviors (inter-personal). Although it is harder for the participants to make these kind of judgments, we didn't want preclude the possibility. And if some items (such as the ones you identified"") did not turn out to be useful through statistical analysis, we will drop them in the final scale. We anticipate to drop at least half of the initial items (40) through analyses and only retain the ones that are truly representative of cultural humility. 

Thank you for honoring your integrity and authenticity in your attempt to respond to the survey! Although my explanation might not change your experience, I hope it at least clarifies things a bit."
TalkTherapy,f9p9phu,t1_f9p8jii,1575526413.0,"Sound like you really didn't like our survey lol. I've addressed your concern about ""N/A"" in a different post. I think these are methodological questions and probably don't arise to the ethical level. We could disagree on this for sure.

Regarding your question about clients don't go to therapy to talk about therapist. I'm 100% with you. That said, during therapy sessions and continuing interactions, clients will develop a sense (perhaps subtle) of where the therapist stand on certain issues. These sense is usually developed from noticing the therapist's nonverbal behaviors, facial expressions, verbal encouragement and engagement (or lack thereof), (subtle) dis/approval, and sometimes explicit statement. These things typically arise naturally in conversations about client's struggles and concerns, rather than focusing on the therapist.

About your second point, I wouldn't say that we presuppose that the participants feel positively toward any of their culture. Rather, this is question is to elicit the participants to list the cultural aspects that they are willing to identify with. An Asian participant may not feel like their ""Asianness"" is the most central identity and does not need to list them. Additionally, the items are primarily assessing the therapist's openness, interest, curiosity, and lack of superiority in discussing culturally-related issues. I don't believe that there are evaluative items that require the participants to like their culture or the therapist to ""agree"" with the clients."
SampleSize,f9p822e,t1_f9p6skt,1575524717.0,"Hi! Thanks for the comment. I do believe that there are controversies in terms whether it is advantageous to include a ""neutral"" ""don't know"" "" not applicable"" in Likert-type scales. There's a ton of literature on related topics, such as odd versus even number of response categories in Likert scales, use of ""mid-point"", addition of ""N/A"", and use of a slider. Specific to whether there's evidence on eliminating ""N/A"" leads to more data variance,   we made the decision based on peer researchers' experiences, rather than empirical evidence (I'm not aware whether there's comparative studies). So I do think you have a point on whether this is valid method.

I want to reiterate that these methodological decisions are very specific to the research question (RQ). If my RQ was to survey the level of cultural humility of therapists on a national level, then I think including an ""N/A"" option is appropriate, because we don't want people to choose a random answer that cloud the true value. However, since my RQ is to develop a scale, I'm primarily interested in the relationship between different items; so, the ""risk"" is relatively low in ""forcing"" the participants to at least have some directional leaning (they can always choose the least extent).

I also agree with you that not including ""N/A"" may lead to frustration and lower response rate and more incomplete answer, which is something that we had anticipated. At least from my perspective, there doesn't seem to be a perfect solution to this. I do apologize if you were frustrated as you fill out the survey and took the time to compose your comments. As a newly-trained researcher, perspectives such as yours are so valuable to hear!"
Christianity,f9bhrlo,t1_f9bhmec,1575212888.0,Thank so much:)
SampleSize,f8z4vix,t1_f8ymqn5,1574956891.0,"I appreciate your concerns and they are very valid! Let me try to give a little context: the goal of this survey is to develop a measure, so statistically we want as much data variance as possible in the responses. Therefore, giving ""other/unsure"" or enabling multiple answers may give people a ""way out"" and therefore is not ideal for the purpose of our study, but would totally be advantageous for other types of surveys. I also agree that we probably should have reiterated that the participant should be responding with one particular professional. 

Thanks so much for taking the time to post these comments! I really appreciate them."
