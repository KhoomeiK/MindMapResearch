aspergers,fq7vm3m,t3_ggvyg5,1589153123.0,"Yeah, I definitely regret telling two of my coworkers one night when we were getting drinks after work. Within a week everyone in my office knew and was treating me differently. I told them very hesitantly, because I was trying to get them to empathize with another coworker I suspect is on the spectrum that everyone makes fun of. 
I tried to explain it to the best of my ability too, I didn’t just casually mention it. I’m not treated like a child, but from that point on, I felt like people were making fun of me behind my back and not taking me as seriously. I always worry that people think I feel like I am better than them in some way, so I feel like they took whatever chance they could to feel superior."
depression,fp60upl,t3_gay2vc,1588343927.0,"Maybe it would be helpful to find someone to talk to online where you can take the time you need to type out your thoughts. I have social anxiety too, and I feel like that would work better for me. Wish you the best!"

Psychic,fmi8pwk,t3_fvcs9b,1586104672.0,"I grew up in the area and would go almost every year around this time. I love them too, and they think about them a lot since I’ve moved to the west coast. 

I’ve been seeing them in the White House garden where they sometimes do press briefings and thinking about how I miss them recently as well. 

As someone said, I think it might have to do with wanting to be in the center of the chaos to some extent. At least for me. I’ve lived in DC and now LA, and I think that’s something I’ve always been drawn to."
Anxiety,flreuue,t3_fq8z5a,1585418761.0,"Yes! It’s incredible to read all these replies and see so much of my own behavior in them. I also have adhd. I really hate responding to texts, especially when it’s just casual conversation. I like to be focused on what I’m doing at the present and I’m terrible at multitasking. When I reply to someone, I worry that they are just gonna text me again, then I’m gonna be right back in the same position. To me avoiding the text is uncomfortable and feels terrible, but if I respond they will just text me more.

I tend to be friends with people who are unaware of how pushy they are/people who are willing to literally beg me to be friends with them. 

Like someone else stated, I just really hate the game of texting. And I’m much happier to just chat with my coworkers when I’m working, and see my old friends when I’m visiting my home town, etc. 

That’s just the way I would rather live my life, but it seems really hard to articulate that to people. 

My anxiety seems to come more from my desired lifestyle just not lining up with most people, and not being able to get others to understand. The avoidance is just my response to something I would really prefer to not have to have in my life."
AskReddit,fivqp4m,t1_fiv6u6g,1582765916.0,I feel the same way. It’s one of the only songs that has been stuck in my head since I was a kid. I start to sing it  in my head every time I think of a creative idea that’s already been done. But that whole album is great. In the car is one of my favorites too. It’s such a timeless song.

aspergers,fdwjnjd,t3_en6pdh,1578759429.0,"I very much relate to this! I went out with some coworkers on Thursday night, and I felt so burnt out on Friday that I was making a ton of social mistakes and could barely formulate words to communicate with people. 

I go out with them occasionally, because I don’t want to be outcasted while I’m at work. They always talk badly about the people who won’t hang out outside of work, and I don’t want to be in that category. But I always really pay for it when I do go out. And now many more social outings are being planned for the future. I feel so overwhelmed by it. People literally beg me to go out with them, even though I’m hardly the life of the party when I do go out.

I quit my last job after two years of this, because I couldn’t handle the social expectations, and I felt like people were starting to treat me differently because of consistent burnout. That was my “dream job” that I had worked years for. I wanted to do something with less of a social expectation and I came to this job where people gossip and talk for eight hours a day. I feel like I’m gonna quit again soon, because I know I won’t be able to keep this up very long."
remoteviewing,fdm49s4,t1_fdk14wj,1578539438.0,"That’s very interesting. I’ve never heard of anyone else mentioning the circus aspect before! I have seen the entities on other trips as well, but that was the only time I felt as though one helped me remote view like that."
remoteviewing,fdjzfye,t3_ellv7g,1578492174.0,"I believe this might have happened to me when I took shrooms at Zion national park last July. 

I saw a very clear image of an alien being in my mind, and then I think I astral projected to this circus-like reality. 

It felt to me like this being was communicating with me and had allowed me to remote view. The message I got is that I’m not quite ready to do it on my own yet and that I want it too badly."
aspergers,fb0m611,t1_favze5z,1576427265.0,"This was such a well thought out and informative comment. I relate to it a lot. Thank you for sharing your wisdom.

I’m also in the aggressively proud stage, and my situation is currently starting to go sour. I could sense the intimidation from people before, but last month I said something at work that was interpreted very badly by the group, and the way people interact with me has changed drastically since. It really sucks, because I feel I’m loosing some to the confidence that took years to build."

It’s similar to Oswald actually. Get an innocent man in jail and kill him there."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,f0yrdyy,t3_d7982m,1569076381.0,"I’m confused about the timing of 9/11 as well. I always believed that I was in 7th grade at the time, until about four years ago when I had a conversation with my boyfriend about it and he said that he was in 8th grade when it happened. He is exactly the same age as me and we graduated the same year, and when I did the math, I realized that he was right and I must have been in 8th grade. I double and triple checked this to make sure he was right.

I accepted that and have had the understanding that it must have been 8th grade for the past several years, until last week. I was having a conversation with my coworkers about where we were when the towers fell las week on the anniversary, and my friend who graduated the same year as me said that she was in 7th grade. I did the math and now it looks like I was in 7th grade when it happened after all.

Of course this is just one year off and could definitely  be due to human error, but it’s really confused me, because of how’s my time I’ve checked this."
spirituality,etefdnd,t1_etdjbwt,1562731122.0,"Thanks for the insight about Kokopelli, that's very interesting. I'm not sure who the spirit was, but it presented itself as that recognizable symbol. Perhaps because I associate it with the desert. 

About setting the intention. We went on the vacation to be in nature as we use shrooms to connect with our consciousness to heal from past trauma. This was the third time we've done it recently, but then it was just in our home. We try to not have an intention as to what we want to work on and let the trip guide us, but just the intention that we are trying to grow and become better each time. I don't believe the result of this trip was due to a lack of intention, but it was what we needed to overcome these particular issues. It wasn't terrifying, but it felt like I was dealing with my darkness and that can be an ugly experience."
occult,etbieib,t1_etb96td,1562647892.0,"Wow, that's interesting and a little scary. We've actually been together for over 10 years, and are old enough to have kids, but I definitely don't feel ready. What's crazy is when I was in the tent while my boyfriend was in the trance, I felt like a mother cat protecting him in the wild. Also during that time I saw a vision of a naked woman with her legs spread open, and I didn't know what to make of it at the time. Man, I really don't want to be pregnant quite yet, but what you're saying does add up.

Definitely did walk away with several really important inspirations, though. Like I said I realized the true reason behind both his phobia with his own filth and my smell sensitivity, because of what happened. There was some other really great stuff too.

Perhaps Masauwu was behind the devil vision, I'm not sure. I feel like the figure I saw on the mountain side was very much Kokopelli, because while I didn't know much about him, I had seen the symbol before. And also I didn't mention this, bet the whole time my boyfriend was in a trance he was humming and making sounds. He later told me that he felt like the universe was playing him like an instrument. 

I feel like Kokopelli was behind that too. We feel like in addition too the thing with the pee and everything, Kokopelli was tuning him to open his throat chakra and gain more confidence after overcoming the trauma of soiling himself in childhood."
