AskMenAdvice,faf6ouk,t1_faf58g7,1576015695.0,Im just trying to make sense of what had happened. Idc if she has feelings im not trying to ruin their relationship. It was a new experience for me and thought maybe someone went through it before and would share something helpful
askwomenadvice,faf04g5,t1_faezwi1,1576011738.0,I see ur point it was just so sudden i was thrown off guard a little. She also didnâ€™t flirt lol
askwomenadvice,faex7qs,t1_faewdw0,1576010034.0,Ffs ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I rephrased the question lmao
askwomenadvice,faevtze,t1_faevifd,1576009227.0,"I have no issues with that, in fact i was the one suggesting staying as friends. I have no intention of ruining their relationship i was curious to know how her behavior completely changed after hooking up and that conversation. Thats all to it"
askwomenadvice,faeupkf,t1_faeuljg,1576008569.0,Alright chill out im just wondering why she was acting that way damnn

dating,f35kry3,t1_f35ka9r,1570680636.0,I knew it had something to do with that bro and Iâ€™ve been trynna lie about it but I cant keep a straight face after that lol so I end up telling the truth..
dating,f34e6gq,t1_f33kwqm,1570653070.0,Finally a proper response lmao thing is some I didnâ€™t even approach to date and theyâ€™re also giving me that weird vibe lol

dating_advice,f1mgnk2,t3_d92f6u,1569593477.0,Update:: she feels the same way
dating_advice,f1eh0nb,t1_f1egvnn,1569422032.0,Gotcha I'll make sure I tell him that
dating_advice,f1egt85,t1_f1edp0o,1569421895.0,Do u want it implied or explicit?? Asking for a friend ðŸ™„
dating_advice,f1e7h34,t3_d92c41,1569415044.0,I was sorta in ur shoes not too long ago. My advice is to just have fun with it and be patient. If they're not interested don't bother theyre more ppl out there
dating_advice,f1e71ol,t1_f1e6wdr,1569414685.0,My man ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I'll keep that in mind
dating_advice,f1e6ycl,t3_d8v9la,1569414609.0,This doesnt answer ur question but whatd u like them do if they're actually interested in dating you? Without ruining the friendship if it wasn't mutual
dating_advice,f1e6o6x,t3_d8wneg,1569414371.0,Guys wont approch if they dont think ur showin any hints. It takes guts to approch girls esp when theyre out with friends. So id say if u see a guy ur mildly interested in def give him hints to ask ur number and maybe stay away from ur friends to make it easier for him.
seduction,ezxumcp,t1_ezxt0p5,1568250080.0,It's a very weird feeling but yeah it feels like I've been objectived fr. The only issue I have with it is the fact that I'm in the middle of a transition period I've been trying to be more outgoing but I feel like ppl esp girls avoid me because of intimidation or fear or something
seduction,ezx7e9m,t1_ezx6mkm,1568233731.0,I've heard that term before but never actually experienced it untill recently. I've acted on it when it first started but now I'm intimidated even more than I used to. Like they don't reject you straight up they just never wanna take it to the next level and it's exhausting
cuboulder,etzuho6,t1_etzc096,1563337241.0,I get what ur saying. Not make up excuses or anything but it feels so much harder when you're coming from a different culture/country. But yeah it seems like that's the only way
COsnow,etzt9zi,t1_etyta7n,1563336740.0,Figured but had to check lol. Where do you get it from?
COsnow,ety3kes,t1_ety1gyp,1563312530.0,Whatâ€™s fu day?
COsnow,etwaa3i,t1_etw9suz,1563260330.0,Ya that makes sense. Thanks
COsnow,etw8ywc,t1_etw8k8h,1563258678.0,"I donâ€™t unfortunately.. thats a good idea! ill check it out. 

Do you know if they do any discounts on certain days or occasions? Or should I buy asap?"
COsnow,etw8oxl,t1_etw8ffv,1563258350.0,Do you have recommendations on where from? Iâ€™m primarily looking for affordable price and same day trips in terms of location somewhere within 2-3 hours drive
cuboulder,etqph4b,t1_etqp2vj,1563096367.0,You're taking the right steps. Good luck in school ur in for a treat haha
cuboulder,etqnjhx,t1_etqn5ig,1563093415.0,You're right I gotta shake off that social scare apparently.  I gotta be honest man wish I was as prepared as you are going in.
cuboulder,etqmnv4,t1_etqm5s1,1563092147.0,Thatâ€™s great advice. Iâ€™ve had those friends since freshmen year that I met pretty randomly actually. It just seems so much harder now because most people already have their own circle of friends.
depression,etnbcxm,t1_etmxsdj,1562982139.0,"You're right. I also blamed my parents for this situation I'm in and trying really hard to stop that. But it's not easy, esp when you think of why you can't do the things you want to do then realize that it would've been so much easier if your parents actually cared about you. Not only care about what you can give them"
depression,esmpn2t,t1_esmienv,1562111391.0,"Ted radio hour, setbacks ep"
depression,esmhzem,t1_eslvp4y,1562106018.0,Sometimes I intentionally induce my depression to make it an excuse for not doing what I'm supposed to do. Which sucks but I do it anyways
depression,esmhs2w,t1_eslbgcb,1562105882.0,I was just listening to a podcast and they were saying that our brains are hardwired to pay close attention to potential threats so it remembers these moment with crystal clear details to maybe avoid it in the future or whatever. Anyways I haven't finished listening but they were saying that we just have to be aware of what's going on and take control over our reactions
depression,eslws8t,t1_esku7f6,1562093723.0,"I guess I have to wait for that moment then. cuz when I did it, it was out of obligation in a way. I was meditating to get rid of depression and I'd always quiet when I get a major episode. It sucks that there has to be that thing that pushes you into doing something, and when it's not there no matter what you do, it'll never help."
depression,esjya9y,t1_esjmhxe,1562045366.0,Thank you for the detailed response but do they really work? I tried meditation a couple times but I didn't feel like it was helping. I did 10-20 minuets for 2 weeks straight and... nothing
depression,esjkmqc,t1_esjjihz,1562035250.0,It sucks
depression,esjkghu,t1_esjfgfy,1562035140.0,"How do you find a club while ur in this shitty mood where nothing interests you anymore? And when you go try something and like it, you'll most likely stop going because there'd be so many people there and you never know what to do with them"
depression,esjjmj0,t1_esjhcrd,1562034596.0,"That's exactly how i feel, you change things up, try to do new things but at the end it all falls apart when you least expect it. I get that and thankfully I haven't been getting a lot of suicidal thoughts recently cuz I changed my attitude toward depression and all this bs. This might sound cliche but I started to think of it as a fight with myself. And so far it's been going pretty good cuz I don't wanna lose. Hang in there, and im kinda contradicting myself here but it has to get better"
depression,esjix0i,t1_esjeejw,1562034140.0,How do you do that though?
depression,esjit0z,t1_esje2ua,1562034067.0,"I feel the same way about there being a higher power. I'm fine with everything in my religion, I just can't bring myself to practice it properly, which is messing with me so bad. I don't know if it's the depression itself draining my energy out or something else"
depression,esjfy2c,t3_c7wj3h,1562032346.0,"I can't really help you but I guess I could try. A feeling I always get when I'm down is that I'm there because I want myself to be there. Because if I'm not I'd have to do something I don't enjoy, school in my case. I still hate myself and loath the existing crap out of me but I know that I can get out of it if I really put in the work, which I'm not. But it's a little comforting to know that it's temporary. All the best"
depression,esd9m4j,t1_escfdoa,1561850998.0,I do the same thing too.
depression,es704vg,t3_c635ty,1561661090.0,I feel that so hard. It takes so long to even have enough motivation to read the hw and when I do I get bored so fast. And it gets harder as the semester goes on
depression,es6zcx7,t1_es5r4on,1561660609.0,"I feel the same exact way. I feel like I lost the ability to talk, cuz whenever I do I almost always say some stupid shit. And I can never talk to the same person again, I'd always avoid encountering them. Feels like I never knew how to talk from the beginning"
