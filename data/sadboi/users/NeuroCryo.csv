Our overreaction was the plan put in place by the best minds in public health and epidemiology.  Looking back on everything, now, its easy to see things that we could have done different.  The fact is with the information we had at the time, those are the decisions that were made.  The truth is, its an emerging pathogen and we don't know what the hell it's going to do as its evolving throughout our species.  The real scary thing is that as healthcare providers they have ventilators and like not really any antiviral or vaccine.  Even then, most of people at that stage croak.

If you only have people over 70 sheltering in place I would imagine at some point they will receive a package from a relative/come into contact with another person not sheltering in place.  I suspect the fear is that with such a long asymptomatic phase we just don't have enough control over inhibiting spread, selectively.

I agree that we are doing a lot of harm with loss of economic activity.  People are more sedentary, people are losing jobs and people can't pay rents.

When you discover antibodies like a drug company you start with billions and select for the best.  Then you have a bunch of essentially HUGE chemicals, and small molecules already have their problems.  Each antibody discovered is its own snowflake and a different thing.  We don’t know until we try if it will aggregate, activate the immune system, undergo posttranslational modification during production, in a mouse, in a human.

But with taking peoples plasma, good antibodies have evolved inside a person.  This highly vets them and means they would essentially pass a phase 3 clinical trial most likely.  There’s ways to sequence antibodies produced in a human.  Honestly every company in the game has their own approach, their own “library” of billions of random antibodies and some are better than others."
