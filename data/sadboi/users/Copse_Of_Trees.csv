I've recently started pushing back on the entire medical community about HSP tendencies. Seems like a gap in the research. And I try not to be asshole about it. I do assertively challenge them to look up literature about it and point to work like the article I linked elsewhere in this thread.

I'm constantly astonished when the reaction from the medical staffer isn't ""Oh, you're probably one of those HSP people. Makes total sense and here's our game plan for that situation""

Also, personal experience - I was on hydroxyzine earlier this year. Even a quarter dose had me in full zombie mode until the following evening.

And raise hellfire if you question it and retreat into self-righteousness. It's a kind of arrogance.

And here's the kicker. Modern Western society seems highly tolerant of arrogance. Sure, at the extremes people scorn it. But it general, ""looking out for self first above others"" is a virtue. Which, to an Fe user, makes no damn sense.

Unhealthy Fe is problematic too. People pleasing. Altruism. Aggressively stepping over self-autonomy at times. But, in my experience, the core of Fe, which to me is empathy, is seen as an unnecessary gift to others, rather than something essential for smooth human interaction.

Don't want this to turn into an us vs. them situation. I do think it's interesting to look at the intersection of the faults of Fi and Fe and broader cultural norms.

I get defensive and (sometimes overly) protective about this conversation issue. I built a whole world view about how I'm not the sole and only problem. That's what is shared below.

This works for me. Doesn't mean it does or does not have to work for others. If what I wrote helps provide insight into self OR HSP life, great! If not, well,  we all come from unique backgrounds with differing perspectives.

K, end of prelude.

My Theory Of Missing Empathy:

1) It is rare to be listened true in the predominant culture of many Western countries. Truly, empathetically listen to. It's hardly ever offered, so people have to fight to be heard.

2) When people aren't being listened to, there are two options:
: Get more aggressive
B: Get more passive

This seems to be partly a personality type distinction. Among the aggro types, conversation is a series of ""I state my thing. Then you state your thing. It's okay to interrupt each other and take conversation any new way I or you want without asking."" It sort of works but also seems like a lot of two people taking past each other. Not much empathy, understanding, or true connection. Being assertive instead of demanding is scary because the other person might say no. 

Passive types will instead have an issue of not being assertive. At worst, they sit around hoping for someone to ask them their opinion and get resentful if no-one's being thoughtful enough to ask them. Asserting oneself is scary because the other person might say no. 

These conversation patterns seem rampant. According to modern social norms being aggressive/arrogant is not seen as a deep fault. Sure, if go too far that way people will get pissed. But low aggressive conversation style is seen as expected and normal.

Put another way, empathy has become devalued. And people aren't held accountable for being thoughtful in conversation. Disrespect is common. And if you have a problem, you are to fight back if necessary.

Conversation has become selfish. A two-sided battleground for attention rather than a mutually respectful dialogue where both people work together to get the needs of both sides met.

For HSP empath types, well speaking for myself, I've come to view this as the way of the world. And to understand that conversation based on aggression toward other rather than connection is downright painful and unnatural to me. Almost intolerable.

In the long run, I'm trying to start a whole ""bring back empathy skills and we'll all be happier campaign. Everyone, not just HSP, seem like they would benefit""

In the short term, I've started ""weaponizing"" empathy by asking for mutually understood conversation rules up front.

Example asks:

- Are you willing to consider that your opinion might be wrong (not saying that it is or isn't, just consider it)? I will hold myself to the same standard.

- What would you like to talk about. Here's a list of X, Y, Z that I'd like to touch on. Would love to hear your list of you have one. We don't have to stick to list. And if there's something you don't want to hear about, we don't have to talk about it, or find a way to alter each other's ask until each ask is comfortable for each person on both sides.

That's two examples. Am working on more. And on making these less clunky. Can say, this is more art than science. Different people will have different reactions. And I try to put my HSP empathy superpower to use understanding what seems threatening or intimidating about it.

K, that's the long version finished. Being a bit arrogant myself, I've found this line of thinking incredibly useful for me. And I start to overextend thoughts that this might be useful for others. This model has become a very deep core of self understanding. I do think I'm objectively onto something with empathy being lacking. But, as I wrote above, is good to practice that I might not be wholly right, or not right at all. But I also might be on to something.

Happy to discuss my ideas. Less thrilled to get into debates, especially anything that starts with ""here's how wrong you are"" vibes. So much nice to read ""hey, have you perhaps considered this? ""

2. Resource extraction. This mostly remains stagnant unless there's new technological innovation in extraction
3. Things like land ownership are very human-defined and not all that ""real"". Territory is a concept in the natural world. But how do we assign value to territory? Is it just the collective resources in that territory? Yes, we can trade land. But land is divided by human laws that are mostly outside of the everyman control. In that sense, we live in a manufactured society. So that's weird to think about.
4. Money is weird. Every other good and service makes sense. Here's a thing, I want a thing, can we trade? But what is the value of money itself?

Wonder what you think of something I've been pondering. Lately I've been thinking of accountability as a sort of triangle of responsibility. There is...

1) Self accountability

2) Close relations (effect of family, co-workers, friends on self)

3) Larger society

When we look at any conflict. Something small like an argument over dinner. Or something massive like a cycle of abuse. In all these things, I think all three of those parties on this list above usually bear some responsibility. Might be just 1%. But I think almost no-one is 100% at fault.

I don't think a particular individual should bear 100% responsibility for becoming a better person when they weren't the whole cause of their suffering (tough life conditions played a role). Some self-accountability? Absolutely! All of it? No help or respect or empathy from close relations or larger society? That seems a touch unfair.

Now, this is the ideal view. Is this what you'll actually get in the world? Debatable. Is it something to stand up and fight for. Start pushing some (not all!), even just a little, accountability off self and onto others?

In my emerging world view, that is something I'm starting to fight for. 

Whew, that was a whole rant. This is a philosophy of sorts I'm developing. Your comment about what to excuse or not excuse got me going about it. 

Feel free to read or not. Also, if anyone wants to debate this, I might or might not respond. Some people love to rail on you and tell you why you are wrong and they are right. I'm more of a ""I might be wrong, you might be wrong, shall we look at it together?"" type."
lostgeneration,fqu4bux,t1_fqtv1xr,1589651768.0,"I have an alternative take. To start though - I myself have encountered selfishness in loads of places. Guessing you have too!

There's an interesting psychologist named David Smail who thinks that a lot of the selfishness derives from external circumstance. Which is to say, people are selfish because society is hard and oppressive and just shitty a lot. And that makes humans respond in defensive and aggressive ways, especially to each other.

I can't really prove it. That said, I'm not sure one can prove it isn't true. I try to keep an open mind about both possibilities. And who knows, maybe some people are predisposed to one tendency or another. I recently learned that emotional sensitivity has a biological component to it for example.

Will end by saying, in my personal life, I've made some amazing connections with hostile people by reacting with empathy to them rather than defensiveness. Wasn't easy. And it can certainly fail. I go in with an attitude that the other person is projecting. And if I ask why enough, I can sometimes find out what's really wrong. Narcissistic or alcoholic parent. Abusive work situation. And so on.

Again, this is just my experience and a world view that has given me solace. If the ""people are selfish"" bring others solace, I can be open to hearing why when I'm at my best. I do ask that they be open to hearing and respecting my views in return. Ya know, because empathy!"

So glad to see you write that quote. I've even gone another step. For me, it's not just that I want to, it's that I'll actively suffer if I don't help. It pains me deeply to see others suffer, especially when someone (possibly me) can help.

One HUGE warning on that point. There is a condition called altruism, which means to put self-needs aside in the name of helping others. This may seem like a virtue, but it's damaging to emotional help. If you feel like you *have* to help and then do, even if you don't really want to, that build resentment in self.

I'm a huge people pleaser. Some people tell me to just walk away, but that's bullshit. I don't just want to help, I *need* to help. So here's the trick - my goal is to find ways to help others that I myself enjoy doing. If I hate cooking and someone is hungry, maybe I can take them out to dinner instead if I can afford it.

See how that worked? I didn't deny my need to help, but I also didn't deny myself either. I found a compromise.

It's not saying the world is bleak. The world is many things.

The point is listening and hearing them. You know, empathy! Students need that sooooo much. 

So that's my current plan A, but seems like a hard field to break into. I guess if I move to Nowhere, Middle of USA maybe.

One idea that's more prgramming-centric. Anything that involved teaching can be a good one. You do have to be patient and let student move at their own pace. Empathy is a skill, right? You can't just be an arrogant ass and then demand validation. But it's one path to consider. Can do something like moonlight teach evening classes at a community college for example."
empathy,fqttabk,t3_gibvwh,1589645683.0,"Hi. Couple thoughts. First is the empathy ""starter pack"". Two basic ideas:

1. The empathy 101 question - ""How are you doing right now?""

Then, follow up by *listening.* If you have judgements, hold them in. Just listen and practice trying to really hear and understand the point of view of the other person. This does *not* mean you have to agree. It does mean trying to hold in your mind that you might not be right. You may be. You may not be. Neither of you may be. The idea here is to try and see what her side looks like from a neutral point of view.

2) Validating feelings. Feelings are always okay. The empathy 102 script:  ""I hear you're feeling \_\_\_\_\_."" ""Can you tell me more about that feeling?""

This one gets hard in relationships. Again, the point here is not judgement about situations. In your mind, if she is overreacting to feelings. It's to start by saying that feelings themselves are happening and that's okay. Human have feelings. They can't be controlled. They can be looked at and eventually moved through. But it's not a switch you turn on or off. You can get to the why behind the feelings.

One great example - someone freaks out in cars. Seems unreasonable at first. But is you ask ""why do you feel this way?"", you might find out their Mom died in a car crash. Suddenly, judging them earlier for being afraid of cars seems misplaced, eh? Not saying it's always cut and dry. The point is, we do not know where others are coming from or why. And part of empathy is trying to hear their lived experience, without judgement."
lostgeneration,fqtrdng,t3_gb8reo,1589644618.0,"Hi,

Just sent you a DM u/cameronlcowan. I am working on a project about the lack of empathy, which I feel would contribute to the struggle. For example - everyone saying that if the job market sucks, just ""try harder"".

Lack of empathy also plays out in the job hunt. Companies are not accountable for treating applicants with basic human dignity / respect.

Another area to talk about is the disrespect given to PhD holders. I could point you to some resources on that (especially the UC Berkeley Beyond Academia organization). Could be a good chapter as there are thousands of not just Bachelor's holders, but actual PhD holders working low level tech jobs, $15/hr tutoring gigs, and so on.

It's just short of unfair in my mind. For me, my grad school was just about worthless for explaining how to do these things. I don't think academia should be a job factory. But, conversely, you get sent out into the world not knowing and not fully equipped to deal with that world.

My take is that schools, society, and employers *should* be a little more accountable for helping job seekers. I'm not saying 100% accountable. Self-reliance is an important skill.

My take is that it's patently unfair to put people through this. You can't fully control building a network - you're relying on the good faith of others to help, which they are under no obligation to provide.

We have no choice, so it's what you have to do. I'm just saying it's okay to find that difficult and hate it. And not have to like it, if that makes sense.

Also, if this rant runs contrary to other people's world views, want to state that I don't think my opinion needs to be universal. If 100% positive thinking / grind it out works for you, that's good.

FWIW, most of the advice boils down to two main concepts:

1) Networking

This is a buzz word, right? For new job seekers, the playbook is this - research careers of interest. Ask around. Look for interesting work, see who does it. Then write to those people and ask how they got where they are. Don't ask for a job, that's a bit presumptuous. If you are courteous, people in general like helping other people. Don't ever expect a reply back, you are asking for a favor here and that's not owed to you. But some people will help. Especially younger folk who themselves are just starting out.

2) The Transferable Skills Pitch  
If you don't have direct experience, you are still likely qualified for all sorts of roles outside your direct field of study. The problem is, qualified isn't usually enough to get hired. Employer want proof that you can do the work, and a pivot skills candidate is riskier than one with direct experience. So, you can either play the odds and try to make the transferable skills pitch (I've gotten to several final round interviews this way). Or, you can train yourself independently if you really feel like it's a career of interest.

There. That's 85% of what CSA would teach you. Sure, there's some tidbits on cleaner resumes, interview skills, ect. But, end of the day, every person looking to hire an individual wants to see two things:

1) Proof that they you can perform the skills of the position, or can learn those skills rapidly and effectively

2) Are you likable. Do you seem to fit the social culture of the current team (within reason)."

I'm not saying that advice is wrong. I'm just not sure how anyone could make a blanket statement covering all fields and industries. I've become increasingly wary of any advice offered by anyone, especially strangers on the internet.

I feel like we're in an age where people overstate almost anything. Humans love to hep. Absolutely love it. And sometimes I think that blinds them from a level of empathy and wisdom that they don't know as much as they think they do, and they don't know the exact circumstance of others."
wholesomememes,fqgen64,t1_fqg61fj,1589344326.0,"Outside of moral/ethical extremes (don't murder, ect.) I, personally, think all other opinions deserve to be respected, in the sense of not jumping to assumptions about why the other person hold that view.

If someone is racist, did they grow up in a family / culture that normalized that view? Is their economic livelihood being threatened? Do they truly hate others just for a skin color, or do they hate their own life circumstance and are projecting.

Which isn't to say behavior is okay. Aggressive, violence, disrespect, all these things should be questioned. My stance is to ask why though, to question of empathy that most people aren't monsters. They are usually afraid, frustrated, getting downtrodden by a hard life, ect. 

I respect the right for people to have reasons why they think they way they do. I think we all owe that to each other. We don't know the circumstance of other.

On the other hand, this culture of ""love yourself first"" can be taken too far, sometimes implying that we don't need the love of others at all to be happy, which I think is a bit extreme.

In my world view, we all need some amount of self-responsibility and some amount of respect/love/understanding from others.

If it's controlling, it's not true respect. One thing I see that happens a lot that gets confused:

People love to offer either help or advice. Often without asking the other person. Then when the other person declines, or just says they'd like help in a different way, the person doing the offerings plays the ""but I care"" card.

In my world view, no-one owes another person acceptance of help offered just because it was offered. In my view, unsolicited help is itself disrespectful, even if it comes from a place of true caring. And I've found that view confuses a lot of people.

 > I have also been close with people who did not share their wants or needs even when they were asked to

This is the opposite of the other behavior in some way. Being overly passive to the point of it becoming a problem. There's not a word I've yet found that describes this. It's a form of extreme selflessness. It's almost of form of disrespect too. Asking that other person pity you or mind read you.

I think the behavior stems from fear. I don't think it's intentional. And it's not directly meant to frustrate another person. But it's still a problem.

Here's the final kicker that confuses everything...

Let's take the ""can't speak up for self"" person. One reason that might be is that they were a victim of repeated childhood abuse. Now, in adulthood, they fear that any assertiveness will be met with violence in return.

In my view, this person is not ""responsible"" for how they are. They didn't choose to be raised in an abusive household. And I think it's unreasonable to then tell that person that they need to take 100% responsibility for overcoming their trauma on their own.

In my world view, it's also on us, as the person interacting with them, to try and meet them halfway.

I like to think of an accountability triangle between self, other, and external circumstance. In most situations, all three of those factors bear some responsibility for a majority of situations.

I feel like we live in a culture that loves to assign blame. And to do it in a 100% manner instead of a more nuanced, ""hey, we all can do our part a little"".

I'm not saying we automatically need to identify abuse victims and coddle them without even knowing their back story. I'm saying if someone is overly passive or aggressive, it can be useful to ask why and approach with empathy rather than judge.

Which isn't to say that you sacrifice your own self-need. Personal boundaries are important. My stance is that the empathetic approach allows the possibly of resolving issues. A defensive stance usually results in further conflict."
wholesomememes,fqg4o7j,t1_fqft0ie,1589337903.0,"I think I probably agree with the spirit of what you're saying but the wording, to me, feels iffy.

No-one owes you love. But I dislike this ""your happiness is 100% on you"". We exist as tribal, social creatures. I'm come to a world view that works me of this. I do feel owed a level of basic respect from others. To have my right to most of my opinions respected (we don't have to agree, but you don't have a right to say I'm ""wrong"" just because you think different).

Respected like that, to me, feels like it should owed, not earned. This opinion tends to be controversial. I really dislike the idea that self-worth comes fully from within.

We need, absolutey need, some validation and respect from others.

If anyone's interested, the work of psychologist David Smail advocates this world view.

And, as I stated, this is just something I've found that's helped me make sense of the world. If ""find 100% happiness from within"" is working for you, it is not my place to judge that.

What I do like to do is present an alternative. I find, for me, that that mindset of wholly self-worth felt shaming, damaging, and was an impossible standard. And so this is me hoping that if other people feel the same, it's okay to question if a different view suits you more.

Also, one final note. I sometime get critiqued and questioned about whether I'm advocating for zero self-responsibility. And that's not at all what I'm saying. Some level of personal accountability is important, I'm saying for me it doesn't feel like it should always be 100% on me always."

It's hard to find in this world and that sucks. You can't choose your family. You can choose your friends.

Same thing with counseling. You choose your therapist. You have a right to fire them at any time. Apply the same standards above to therapists. Some will truly listen, others give only advice. Fire ones that give only advice. Be willling to listen to the ones truly listening to you"

hsp,fpkt6wz,t3_gdqwp1,1588700610.0,"Here's my bleak but hopeful take on this:

There is a MASSIVE accountability issue in modern society. All of run around trying to assert ourselves, saying ""Hi, this is a need of mine. Are you willing or able to help"".

No-one ever owes you that help. BUT.... for the vast majority of humans, they will authentically help in any way they are able. This only happens when they are not otherwise stressed. You may say, wait, don't plenty of humans help ll the time. Yes, bu so, so often they are feeling pressured into doing so. They can put pressure on themselves (the other person won't like me if I don't, ect.) or someone is putting pressure on them (boss says you have to teach the new guy and you have no say in it). Resentment is pressured-fueled help expressing itself.

In modern life, everyone is so goddamn stressed out. We're feeling the weight of a million things constantly.

And here's the kicker ... it is NOT their fault. But, society sends political and socioeconomic  messages that our struggle is 100% our responsibility. That is horseshit and abusive. It is abusive because we all have such a small in how things are run. We didn't choose this system, are living by its rules, and the system then has the gall to say we ourselves are the only ones who are responsible for our suffering.

When someone constantly tell you that yourself are responsible, you internalize it. You start to think it's actually true (it isn't). But once you think it's true, this happens:

If you are 100% responsible for your own success, they any failure. Any, anywhere in life, is your fault. That's why low self-worth is everywhere.

Then, to OP's point. Another aspect of 100% responsibility is that system never takes accountability for anything. It is all on you, always, unless you can dispatch it somewhere else. Since it's literally impossible to take full responsibly, you have to choice but to vent that out somewhere. And the worst part is, you're not the one at fault.

Society literally forces us take our oppressed pain out on others. At best, we try to be assertive - ""hey, would you be willing to help?"". When that doesn't work, the pain (like the spice for you Dune fans) must flow. So we retreat into either aggression (fight), avoidance (flight), or passivity (freeze). 

The final note here - I haven't touched on HSP yet. All the non-HSP's out there, they are facing the same amount of abuse  we aare, but they literally feel it less. Our nature is to feel more. We are the best helpers, and the worst abuse takers. Society needs both, but right now society is at critical stress constantly. I view HSP types are canaries / bellweathers. Our distress is a signal to the whole tribe that something is wrong. 

The other shitty part - because we're more sensitive, we tend to find it harder to assert ourselves and get pushing into aggression, avoidance, or passivity  more easily. So we tend to ""lose"" exchanges, take on more of the duty, and wind up feeling intense resentment.

Here's the sort of bright news.

That resentment is the final stop in the pain flow. It sucks, but here it is. How do we deal with it. You hold the *true source* of the pain accountable. And the super hard thing is - it's not coming directly from other people. As tempting as it is to put the blame there, these people are, by and large, not wholly responsible for the stress they are facing. They have no choice, as we discussed above.

As cliche as it sounds, the ""system"" is the problem. People will say that the system is inherently unfair and that it can't be controlled. Controlled can be defined as - held accountable and dealt with. That is an opinion, not a fact (people like to say it's a fact, it is not).

The system is unfair and most people give up and take the abuse. I say, fuck that. Systems are understandable. Life climbed out of a swamp. Humans came to be, started walking, conquered so much of nature, and then flew to the stars. We are fucking amazing at figuring shit out.

I have decided my mission in life is twofold:

1) Study this ""system"". As it stands currently, it is a great unknown. There any many idle theories. Get your shit together people and work on this in a meaningful manner. But, people are struggling to work together. Because they are so damn stressed. Which leads to #2

2) Make people realize what the situation even is. Right now I point my pain at the system because there is nowhere else for it to go. My goal is to thus teach people about the pain. The causes. The social dynamics that play out when you are not aware of the pain source. Often not even consciously aware that you are in pain. 

\#1 puts the job solely on us. Fuck that. I'll do my part, I'm no freeloader. But I want help. Everyone is down here with me, they could all chip in. So #2 is a recruitment campaign. Teach people about the pain. Teach others how to help each other reduce the pain.

And, critically - if we work together, less pain points develop. A pain point is when two humans come into conflict. They react poorly and it's more chance for pain to spread. And it grows. One person's pain turns into the pain of two. If we head conflict off at the pass. Stop it from starting. Catch it sooner and repair it. We reduce pain everywhere. And that frees up all of us to spend more time working collaboratively to explain the ultimate source, ""the system"", and keep battling to make the system less pain inducing for all.

If you read this whole thing, thank you. Hope it helps. This is my attempt at a #2 effort. I'm starting with HSP's because you're way more likely to understand this theoretical world view theory. You've all been great. See ya in the comments :)"

CPTSD,fpbh33x,t1_fpbewl8,1588469854.0,"> it is ultimately on them [the abuser] to stop that behavior

Counterpoint to that argument. Why isn't in on anyone else? Someone points out the abuse to others. Rather than help the abuser recover, the others yell at the abuser, shame that person, and tell them the abuser that they alone need to change.

But, as you conceded, *they weren't responsible for becoming this way*.

That does not seem fair. Not at all. Accountability needs to occur for abuse. But who is more responsible. The person doing it because they see no other option but to do so. Or the people who stand by, watch, and do nothing?

[This movie scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwIJ9pRWBpo) is a great explanation of what I'm talking about. The evil of indifference. Or even worse, shaming others rather than helping them.

Put another way: Americans don't hate immigrants because they steal jobs. They hate that they are losing their own job, and need something to blame. But why are immigrants coming here? Immigrants don't want to drive Americans out. Immigrants couldn't care either way about Americans - all they care about is that they themselves need a job. Americans, if they peeled it back a layer, hate that conditions in Central America are so bad that most people feel that fleeing to America is their best option.

And telling immigrants to fix their own country assumes that immigrants could fix their own country. Which, is that even true? And if it is possible, why aren't we helping them fix their country? No, rather than help, which is hard, we instead just blame and shift all accountability onto them and don't think anything ourselves to stop the root cause.

Well, and who is ourselves. Because everyday Americans have no idea how to help Central American countries create better conditions.

So, where the hell then *is* the real fault? Capitalism? Corporations? The inherent cruelty of nature?

I refuse to believe that life is unfair and cruel for no cause at all. There must be some reason out there and I've decided that I want to my energy to answering that question rather than keep blaming others for things outside their control."

I can't leave all of humanity. Pretty much no-one can. Even if you do learn how live on your own in the woods, human biology dictates that social isolation will have negative mental consequences.

CPTSD,fpbc9vu,t1_fpb8rvz,1588466747.0,"My point is to establish a baseline. It's not explicit, but as current written the phrase reads like ""no respect is given, any respect must be earned"".

I guess the real problem here is that the language of any sentence like this leaves no room for middle ground. Does ""respect"" in this phrase mean some or all? It's left unclear. So two people can believe different meanings and point to this phrase as proof that their's is the correct way.

The reality of common sense fairness is: ""Some amount of respect is always given, other respect is earned"". And there is no bright line where that line is. But it is painfully obvious where the extremes are and why they are problematic.

As an empathic person, I guess I prefer the ""respect too much, you can always lower the respect later"" rather than the more selfish and potentially hurtful ""respect too little and then prove me otherwise"". People who like that latter think that if others get hurt, that's there problem. Those people are blame shifting assholes. We can't always choose our feelings in the moment. We can't all be coddled either, but those assholes use ""toughen up"" to excuse almost any behavior and that's so patently unfair and they get away with it.

Why they are constantly allowed to get away with it eludes me and is something I'm investigating."
CPTSD,fpb5vjy,t1_fpaui3a,1588462760.0,"It's occurred to me that a lot of modern society has decided we owe each other. Every person for his or her self. Up to and including basic respect. 

One example, I just got out of a heated discussion today. During that exchange I had my bad moments. But I tried to repair the conversation by admitting all the ways I'd lashed out. I took accountability for my disrespectful behavior. I realized I hadn't fully heard their point and apologized for that.

This other person was trying to give me advice. She's a career counselor. And I was saying why I don't think the advice was working for me. Not for everyone (well, I started there, always a bad move!), but for me. And she just kept repeating how her advice worked for her and wasn't acknowledging what I was saying. It was a refusal to acknowledge my stance in any way.

And the thing is, somehow she can. She has the power to do so. Why? Because we have set up a culture where refusing to take accountability for basic decency is, at worst, tolerated. And at best, accepted and even celebrated.

And I just don't know what to think of that. A person can say ""I have a right to be a selfish ass"" and there is no authority I can appeal to. Especially someone in a power position. I pay this women in that above conversation by the way. She's part of an organization I paid for. And they backed her over me, and probably look at me as a troublesome client.

And, in their own view of non-accountability, I have no leverage.

I think, writing it out just now, a problem is the breakdown of ""the tribe"". In a small, close-knit tribe, if someone behaves in a blatantly disrespectful manner, everyone sees it. And I can appeal to others to hold that person accountable and force out a reckoning. Hopefully with empathy. But with consequences too for such selfish behavior.

In a modern, disconnected world, there is no ""social order"" to appeal to. We interact mostly with strangers. Hell, right now I'm writing to a text box version of a person sheltered by total anonymity. We have a modicum of forum regulation.

I just don't know. Personality accountability feels like a dying concept and I'm not sure why or how to stop it."

I guess, as one starting point, the world currently operates more under ""respect is earned"" and there's plenty of narcissists feeling enabled already. I think they, in their minds, form an unhealthy world view that they've already earned respect.

Maybe both phrases can be used as enablers. I think one key of narcissism is an inflated sense of self-importance. So, if ""respect is expected"", a narcissist way to abuse that would be to claim they've been respectful when they haven't been. And blame shift on to you that you're not seeing their respect correctly."
