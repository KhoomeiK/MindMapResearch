Nana had severe asthma her whole life; constant inhalers, the whole thing. She often would get these attacks, wheeze for a bit, grab a puffer and be fine.
So one night she fell asleep on the couch watching tv, and woke up having a severe asthma attack.
She told us she couldn't catch her breath, and she also couldn't get up to go grab her inhaler which (I think) was in her bedroom.

So, she's hacking and wheezing and her vision is going blurry, and she told us she looked up and there was a man in a cloak standing on the other side of the room (she *insists* it was Death.) she looked at him and said ""Fuck off, I'm not ready.""

She then caught her breath long enough to run to her room and grab her puffer.

Nana was definitely one to tell the grim reaper to fuck off hahah."
