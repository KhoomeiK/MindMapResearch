mentalhealth,fqci40g,t1_fqc61hm,1589258795.0,That's physical attraction again with no emotional base. I've had and done that to people and had it done to me. That's not recognizing a lack of substance.
mentalhealth,fq8wzbz,t1_fq8wvr3,1589178013.0,Then you're conflating physical with emotional. Your previous description implied it was Not being as attracted for other reasons. There are physically attractive good people too.
mentalhealth,fq8wlkd,t1_fq8wjgq,1589177675.0,I wasn't as physically attracted.
mentalhealth,fq8w7yl,t1_fq8w5sm,1589177343.0,"Lol, everyone needs emotional attraction that's normal. Physical base attraction helps but I've slept with and had realations with people just because I was mostly emotionally involved."
mentalhealth,fq8vzqa,t1_fq8vuo6,1589177148.0,Discuss with friends you have that have healthy relationships. Maybe ask them what healthy looks like to them. Also be introspective on what things did make you legitimately happy that weren't toxic in those relationships.
mentalhealth,fq8vsdd,t1_fq8vn2c,1589176968.0,"Lol, nah, Attraction needs to also be there and real emotional attraction takes time. Physical attraction is easy but start with at least expecting the person to be consistent, on time and polite lol. Unlike me I'm always late. But I always show up. Also maybe shared past experiences etc help."
mentalhealth,fq8vgot,t1_fq8vafu,1589176691.0,You have to first work on figuring out what those pieces look like seperately. Using your past experiences you can easily define what you don't want. Try to build o. What your triggers are from there. on the opposite end try to define what those seperate pieces are and how that'd look as a person supporting you. Etc

interracialdating,fq8urzq,t1_fq8uija,1589176122.0,Kind of agreed unfortunately. Unless it comes up organically Id say leave it but maybe discuss with your partner privately.
mentalhealth,fq8umn6,t1_fq8uil7,1589175997.0,Oh Ive been in plenty of toxic relationships. But I notice you didn't define a healthy one.if you want to find the healthy relationship you need a definition of what that looks like for you.
mentalhealth,fq8twpi,t1_fq8tt82,1589175409.0,"Yeah,I gathered that much but what does that amount to exactly? Bad sex, sex after being treated poorly, good sex after being treated poorly. What does bad look like and what does healthy look like?"
