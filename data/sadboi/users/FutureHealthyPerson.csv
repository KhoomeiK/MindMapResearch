May I ask what home DBT app you use? I'm definitely taking notes on the other resources you mentioned!"
BPD,fqxy7x7,t3_glfgi4,1589739655.0,"For me it is partially self-esteem (seeing my self worth as based on what I can do for others), but also partly shifting responsibility onto others. So if something doesn't work out, it's their fault because I only did what they wanted. 

Of course, I had a say the whole time and was always allowed to/capable of/responsible for make decisions makes on my own needs/wants. But it has taken me years for that message to sink in because I didn't believe it. I was so convinced that it would be selfish or catastrophic somehow to figure out my wants or to make my needs known. 

So by telling myself that it is ""bad"" to make myself a priority and by essentially pressuring others to tell me their needs/wants to help me make decisions, I also make all consequences their problem :( 

I combat that by reminding myself that forcing my ""help"" on others is also a form of poor boundaries and lacks their enthusiastic consent, which is obviously not how I want to see myself. It puts a little (healthier) distance between other people and my decision-making. 

Additionally, I am trying to make the kind of decisions I would want a parent to make for me, since a lot of my issues stem from controlling and demeaning parents growing up. I have trouble doing healthy kind things for myself so this particular framing has been effective for me."

BPD,fqvwle2,t1_fqr5yul,1589686842.0,"Haha no problem. I don't check Reddit for days at a time, actually. Just got lucky and happened to take a look for the first time in a while! I hope your crazy few days have been taken care of!

Yeah apparently the frozen orange thaws and takes on an interesting squishy/slushy texture that you can eat with a spoon after if you are so inclined? I've never tried it though! 

Welp, yeah same, my main distractions for the last several years have included Pocket Camp! The cute music and fishing and shaking trees and catching bugs is just so much better than facing hard times! But I am glad you are having a good enough experience in grad school to choose that instead, even when it sucks. It gives me hope that I may be able to go one day too and that not all academia is a shitshow (or is at least one that I can handle one day). 

Oh man, my journey learning about BPD is long and winding. Years and years ago I had come across descriptions in my frequent shallow google searches about mental illness but never really gave it much thought? And then a then-close friend got diagnosed and tried to explain it to me but all I could really understand was depression, trauma, and high-functioning persona, which seemed all very normal to me lol. 

I kept trying to understand by reading people's experiences though (while staying non-judgemental) and realized the idealization and devaluation cycles are 100% my mother, but my therapist said my mother fit more NPD traits than BPD, which was a shock to me because I never saw my mother in any of the NPD things I've read. More misconceptions I had to wade through I guess. 

With BPD becoming more visible in online support spaces and me being in DBT, I started to understand the thought processes a little more, so much that when my therapist told me my latest ex exhibited several borderline traits, everything just immediately clicked into place. The only phrase that kept repeating in my head was ""fear of abandonment."" 

Since then I've been on a couple of the BPD related subs, including the ones for people without it, and making sure to take things with a grain of salt. It's helped to explain a lot more of my ex's behaviors and that of other former loved ones in my life. It was actually repeated posts in the non-BPD subs that started making me question my own traits, though. 

Stuff like ""splitting"" when things don't line up the way you expect or when someone doesn't fit your ideas of ""good"" or of what they ""usually are like"". Seeing everything as evidence of a hunch you already have. Constantly vacillating between ""I'm too good to be like everyone else"" and ""I am not as good as everyone else"". Not knowing how to adult/human. Feeling like you always have to be right or heard. Pushing people away due to a lack of trust. Going to extremes to be likeable in every interaction. Having extreme mood swings in response to perceiving human interactions as intoxicatingly good or catastrophically bad. 

And some other innocuous stuff like being overly worn out from maintaining appearances or only being able to tolerate entertainment that is highly idealized/simplified. There's probably more but I'm bad at thinking of things off the top of my head (as evidenced by the absolute book of an internet comment I just wrote, SO sorry).

But yeah! Also same at the judging others for things we do ourselves! Especially the part about having tough conversations! Go you for realizing it because I think that alone is very brave. Even non-disordered folks can have their heads in the sand for way long! And be bad at having tough conversations. But whether or not they do anything about their issues, we can still work on ours. Cheers to us!"
BPD,fqvtt74,t3_gl6sfq,1589685025.0,"Relating to all of this. I've realized most of my disordered thoughts are things my likely NPD mother has drilled into me growing up. Her ""voice"" if you will. I fantasize about moving far away to be around strangers as well and every now and then struggle to stay sober. 

Working on strengthening my own voice to drown hers out. To help me make better choices. Stay strong. There is a future that is not this."
BPD,fq8guqd,t1_fpt8y8s,1589165892.0,"Ohhh I think I misunderstood. Yeah, I do use other kinds of coping mechanisms more like the ice cube/pepper strategies! I prefer sensory mindfulness exercises like body scans or naming sounds/tastes etc. The DBT therapist I saw specifically suggested against things like chili pepper or rubber band snapping because it could become an outlet for SH for some people so I just never tried, but someone in my group suggested frozen oranges and that always sounded interesting! But I am rarely around a freezer when I need to snap out of it ASAP. 

Alternatively, I like to dissociate/distract myself by playing cute cell phone games, but that's also a rabbit-hole of ignoring reality in favor of numbness haha. I hope the chili pepper works for you, though, because I lol'ed at your line about spiciness changing your mood!!

Aw thanks. I would only call the one with dark triad traits an asshat - the other likely has BPD and my empathizing with him and learning about BPD is what led me here tbh. So I can't really hate him too much. If I had more trust in taking my own direction in life I wouldn't have ended up with either of them, so I guess that's my hand in things. Onwards and upwards.

Maybe a better way of putting it, is I gravitate towards people who I think are better versions of me but I've been woefully ignorant of the negative side of the coin. Facing the fact that I keep choosing the wrong people (not just in dating but otherwise) AND the fact that what makes them wrong for me is also deep-seated in my nature is... daunting. It's scary how such awful dynamics can feel so comforting to us, regardless of the reason! So thank you for thinking my hard-headed mission is brave lol. If I can actually make sure the self-hate is brief and temporary, maybe I'll believe it someday! But for what it's worth I think you are brave too for recognizing that you gravitate towards people with low empathy and that it is bad for you. Go you!!!"
BPD,fpqee63,t1_fpps74u,1588820918.0,"Ack, I'm not sure I'm one to recommend coping mechanisms haha. I would say I'm as highly logical as I am highly emotional, which sometimes works out worse than expected because I can justify circles around myself. Probably the healthiest thing I do is ask myself how certain people much calmer + more consistent than I am would react to something. Whether or not I follow through is another story!

Ooh I have taken like 1.5 psychology courses in my life so I only know anything based on observation and personal experience. I didn't even consider lack of acknowledgement! And no worries, I was fine, but thank you for your concern :) (tbh they've done way worse than just being weirdly obsessed with their relationships/lack of relationships with their birth names and then projecting that baggage onto my own name...)

Mhm! I think the people I tend to fall for have actually had high levels of empathy, but low levels of relating to others, if that makes sense? At the end of the day, though, the things I am attracted to in them are reflections of what I thought were my own best traits (spoiler alert: not as great as I thought), so now I'm on this hard-headed mission to face all my own worst traits I was mistaken about. Which anyone here would probably say is a terrible idea because it's a slippery slope to excessive shame and self-hate. And they would be right! 

My latest thing is to try to reframe my healing in a positive way rather than seeing it as endlessly identifying negative traits. Hopefully a shift in my attraction patterns will follow! Fingers crossed. I hope you also see a positive shift in your attraction patterns!!!"
BPD,fppkjkb,t1_fppee5f,1588803982.0,"It's important to balance honoring your feelings and facing the facts :) I am glad you're doing better and I am too, thank you!

As for my exes, both had significant identity disturbance. They both resented their names because other people were also given those names at birth so they would constantly make a big deal out of how names shouldn't be tied to identity and how people who are possessive of their names are supposedly shallow and not unique. In reality, it is definitely okay and even good for names to have emotional weight! It helps us form our identities as separate but equal beings. 

Thank you for your kind words. I've since learned to avoid anyone whose personality I am attracted to, since acting out due to identity issues seem to be a common thread and I end up bearing the brunt of it if they end up liking me back."
BPD,fpp6s2t,t1_fpoyv6s,1588796951.0,"You know what, I'd say that someone you like never calling you by your name is a pretty valid red flag! That's really weird??? 

Idk maybe I'm projecting but in my experience, my two cluster B exes hated their own names and never liked being called by their names and as a result rarely used my name either unless they were upset with me. Of course there were other reasons, but the name issues were definitely a contributing factor to my feeling like the relationships weren't real or like I was being kept at arm's length. 

So I'd say that you were in the right to feel put off by that, though I'm sorry you had to deal with the resulting abandonment issues :("
BPD,fpownom,t1_fpovscv,1588791938.0,"Lmao I once fell for someone because I liked the way they said my name. The resulting ""high"" of the crush led to weeks of hypomania (am diagnosed bipolar rather than BPD but possibly have both so really who knows what that emotional state truly was).

BPD,fpom6e9,t1_fpna8jb,1588786828.0,"It's my understanding that the underlying causes of bipolar mania (chemical/physical triggers) and BPD ""mania"" (emotional triggers) may be different but they present in similar ways because the resulting feelings and neurotransmitter cascades are the same.

BPD,fpoklxw,t3_ged6n8,1588786076.0,"(TLDR at the bottom!)

Disclaimer: I don't struggle with the same thing exactly but I find that I either overshare or I act overly secretive. My ex did consistently struggle with hiding things and telling small (to him, inconsequential) lies around all people, though, which your post reminds me of a lot. He always felt like he was being pressured to spill all the things, or that he was being accused of malice for keeping things to himself.

First thing's first. It is totally okay to hide things from someone who is abusive and who tends to manipulate details to make you feel bad about yourself. That has kept you safe from your mom so far. 

But now the thing that kept you safe from your mom all these years has become another thing your mom is using to make you feel bad about yourself. And has become another thing that keeps other interpersonal relationships at an arm's length. 

So the trouble here is that not everyone needs all details kept from them at all times. Some details will not be used against you. Some people are not looking to turn things back on you. They may call out inconsistencies, but that is okay, too. They are just making sense of what is in front of them, same as you or me. And people tend to trust more when the facts in front of them line up. That's all it is. 

Usually people are not actually looking to know everything, nor do they actually believe your inner thoughts affect them (though nosy gossipy people definitely exist). Usually people who make us feel like they are doing either of those things are just making sense of things, though the most annoying of them will be bad at tact or boundaries. 

I suspect that you, like myself and my ex, may have trouble knowing what details are safe to disclose, which people are safe to disclose certain things to, what situations are appropriate for sharing more, and what wording to use to gracefully sidestep being called out for inconsistencies/being labeled as weird or overly secretive. 

And all that is perfectly understandable, given that you've grown up around someone (your mom in this case) who you've learned to hide things from as a form of self-protection. But you're not in that situation anymore, or not at least 24/7. We're a little older now, with a quite a bit more agency and it is entirely possible (and helpful!) to learn a more complex method of self-protection. 

I think it is entirely possible to maintain your boundaries with your mom while still being someone who does not elicit suspicion from healthier people, even if you end up changing your mind about what you do tell people. It's okay to change your mind, after all, because people do it all the time! It's also okay to have multiple feelings on a subject at once etc etc. If they still find you weird after that, then they're the weird ones! 

I hope this wasn't too long. TLDR you're definitely not the only one. It is hard to learn how to interact with others in a healthier way when the way we've been doing it so far has protected us so reliably. I try to think of it as gaining additional skills instead of getting rid of what we already have."
BPD,fphmurm,t1_fp82p7e,1588624074.0,"I used to do dissociate more but developed panic attacks instead :( I am really good at dissociating from a childhood of not feeling safe enough to stand up for myself but I thought it would be healthier and more Adult to develop some standards and boundaries for what I'd be willing to put up with from authority figures because I thought it would be worse for my future to just become a zombie and continue to ""take"" abuse while I take a break from my body. Guess that's backfiring on me. Now even when I dissociate (right before I talk back) people just double down because it's written on my face that I'm upset/traumatized and they don't like the idea that they're making me feel bad. Or maybe my last three environments have just been on the shittier end. It's really hard trying to leave them behind and develop a middle ground of expectations where people aren't AS bad as the past but I can ALSO recognize some situations aren't as bad as they feel in the moment."
BPD,fphlzva,t1_fpc13jd,1588623633.0,"Mostly I haven't been doing any formal reading, just browsing my usual Reddit, Youtube, etc. and gravitating towards more adult self-help/reparenting type of anecdotes. Been trying to recognize things in myself that are not serving me and things in healthy people that I have never considered doing for myself. 

The one thing that I just finished and found really helpful is a book called ""The Defining Decade"" by Meg Jay. I'd always been focused on parenting/child development content to identify what I've been lacking, but lately I've been wanting more content about what I can do for myself now that I am an adult and have realized I can't rely on any other adults. 

This book is focused on the importance of our twenties. The author approaches the twenties as a decade of development similar to how early childhood and adolescence are important periods of development and I found that to be a good combination of How to Adult and How to Grow. I don't think someone has to be in their twenties to read it because it's never too early to know what's ahead and it's never too late to take back control of one's future. 

Thanks for saying I inspired you! I haven't been feeling very empowered or inspired myself but I come here and remember we are all working on things together. Good luck to you too. 

In regards to your other comment - I don't imagine ever telling someone that outright, nor do I want to imagine someone taking that well! I prefer to think of it in the way that all people are constantly evolving. No need for us to be constantly advertising that ours is extreme to the point of being considered disordered. I'd prefer to just let ""off"" moments be waved off as a one-time weird thing. It is a healthy for all people, NT or not, to seek out stability in the people they surround themselves with and I wouldn't want people to start accepting instability as a norm by ignoring what society typically regards as a red flag. 

I do think it is important for people with mental illnesses and people (disordered or not) who are undergoing personality development to be accepted and for stigma to be dismantled, but I am not sure unprompted disclosure of an identity issue is helpful for that. I can imagine a more sanitized version that goes more like ""I am just working on becoming a better/more mature/more sincere/more mindful/etc. version of myself."" More than that, though, I think the best thing we can do to put others at ease is by showing through our future actions that we are capable of doing/being better and more consistent. Developing a stable pattern is usually effective for minimizing any weird interactions from earlier in the relationship!"
BPD,fpbvktp,t1_fp4gofs,1588479859.0,"Yeah stuff like that always escapes me unless I've had a lot of time to brainstorm on my own (and even then it's a challenge). 

To prep for college applications, my high school had us pick three words that captured who we were. It caused so much anxiety. I either felt like I had too many or too few words. Didn't really have any words that felt ""right"" either. 

I'd always been told I was strange because I could act so differently in different circumstances, but I always felt like ""me"". Part of why I never considered a BPD diagnosis is because I never resonated with things like ""lack a sense of self"" or ""wavering personality"". 

From my perspective, it just made sense that somber situations require a somber outlook and casual situations mean I can be a little silly. But now that I think about it, maybe other people were seeing something inauthentic that I didn't realize about myself. I guess I can see how a big contrast in my demeanor can seem alarming.

So I dunno how we can get to know ourselves better. Instead I've been reading a lot and at the end of the day I care more about the kind of person I want to be rather than on ""who I am"", so I'm focusing my efforts on how to get to that as wholeheartedly and intentionally as possible for no one but myself."
