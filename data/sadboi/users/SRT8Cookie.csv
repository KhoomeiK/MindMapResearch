Escorts from documentaries that I've seen tend to carry themselves with class and don't talk trashy or act trashy, they do things in a safe way in a safe place. That's respectable. Prostitutes on the other hand have always been ghetto, loud, rude, unsafe and just overall not great people from every thing I've sadly seen and been around there's a big difference. They both are sex workers but one does it in a professional manner while another fucks guys without protection, don't get tested and spread diseases to guy by telling them they're clean when they really aren't. I think that's where a big confusion comes from."

unpopularopinion,f2dniyc,t1_f2df2cn,1570159066.0,"That’s why you should set a proper schedule. Don’t tell someone that their appointment is at a certain time unless you know for sure that by then you can attend them without having to wait. Always plan ahead and set way more time aside than you need because 9/10 it’s going to take longer than you estimated. This is a simple case of not scheduling things right. I was in a job that required me to be on time with each customer because the appointments were set for the customer to come in right at their appointed time. Never had an issue with making people wait because I always made room for extra time Incase I needed it and in the few cases I did need it, I had it and didn’t have to keep customers waiting."

unpopularopinion,f2dj4ts,t1_f2ae28b,1570155595.0,"Yeah no shit people aren’t your property. I agree with OP to an extent. If you are in a relationship with someone you owe them an explanation as to why your breaking up with them. This is where I disagree with OP. You shouldn’t be forced to give them another chance after you tell them. It’s just a decent thing to tell someone the reason for the break up. Just one day going “Hey we’re breaking up bye” messes people up especially if they’re emotionally invested in you. It leaves them with insecurities and it can ruin their lives. Remember, both of you agreed to be in the relationship no one put a gun to your head and forced you to be with them."
unpopularopinion,f2div5f,t1_f2ar922,1570155391.0,It’s not about changing people it’s about offering someone closure and the reason why you’re breaking up with them. They can agree or disagree with your reason it doesn’t matter. Breaking up with someone without telling them a reason creates self image issues and often times leaves a person feeling like they aren’t enough.
unpopularopinion,f2diqyf,t1_f2b7zgh,1570155304.0,It’s not about fixing things. If you’re breaking up with someone and they are already emotionally invested in you you should let them know why you are breaking up with them. That type of stuff fucks people up and leaves them insecure and feeling like they aren’t enough.
unpopularopinion,f2difik,t1_f2cr0kr,1570155063.0,"When I was in high school, a kid called my friend a bitch, I told him there wasn’t a need for that, he got in my face and pushed me infront of security, I tried de escalating the situation and he just swung on me so I swung back, security comes and as soon as he does I stopped swinging. When the cops came and asked why it happened I told them it was self defense they asked other kids who saw and they all said the same thing, the kid swung first out of no where. The cop then asked the security that was on his bike if it was true and all security said was “I don’t know I didn’t see”. Ended up being taken to jail, booked on assault charges, spent a week in juvi and to make matters worse, the cop told me the kid was a gang member and since I “fought” him I was going to be labeled a gang member as well. Now anytime I get pulled over and they ask if I’m a registered gang member I have to say yes and I get searched and everything. It’s truly bullshit."

unpopularopinion,f2dgbwh,t1_f2bodia,1570153466.0,References shouldn’t be too credible honestly. I’ve had friends who had worked their ass off at their job and when they turn in their 2 weeks notice they immediately get assigned all the shitty jobs they didn’t have to do before and the employer then bad mouthed them to all the other managers of stores they knew. I’ve been seeing it happen more and more too it’s like employers can’t seem to understand that not everyone wants to be in the same position for their whole lives and act like it’s most disrespectful thing someone can do.
unpopularopinion,f2dfqfg,t1_f2ash64,1570153025.0,And you are the asshole jealous of cars. You’re the type to think that because someone has a nice car they’re looking for attention. There’s a whole culture and passion behind fixing up cars. There isn’t a culture or people passionate about driving regular stock cars. You are the asshole for immediately jumping to the conclusion that people with nice cars just want attention. I can tell you right now we don’t care about what you think especially if you drive a basic Honda. Grow up man the world doesn’t revolve around you.

But to say that at any time of day you should turn down the music is bullshit. I’ve been through it so you can’t say that I don’t know how it feels. I had a neighbor who had a motorcycle and he had an extremely loud speaker with a shit ton of bass, it would always wake me up when he would leave and turn on his music because I could hear it through my walls but I’m not going to tell him to turn it down during the day because during the day is the time to do stuff like that. He has the right to enjoy himself because he works hard for his stuff. He was respectful and if he would come home late he would not have his music on. I’m not going to give a guy shit because he wants to enjoy his life especially when he does so in a respectful manner."
unpopularopinion,f2deg6f,t1_f2c7rtd,1570152075.0,My car came with some pretty good speaker with pretty good bass stock. I’m not going to lower down my volume in a residential neighborhood. I should be able to play my music as loud as I want with my speakers being stock. If they were aftermarket with a subwoofer I wouldn’t but since it’s stock I am going to play them as loud as I want. Doors closed and windows up all your hear is a baby thump if your super close with the windows down you can only hear it if you’re pretty close to the car (I’ve tested this before I turned up my music as loud as it goes and lowered my windows got out of the car and walked and I didn’t get very far before I couldn’t hear anything.

Get to know the bigger people who host the meets and stuff like that get to know some of the owners of local business owners, a lot of them are barely starting off and are willing to do sponsorships which can help with things such as detailing, decals and shirts, performance parts, performance shop discounts, etc and it will help you have a bigger presence so when you start up the club people will be more likely to join."
