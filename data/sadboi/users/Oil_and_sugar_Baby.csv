AskNYC,ff71v54,t3_ertgnd,1579639458.0,"Met my x of 5 years at a Mexican Diner 10 years ago . We still talk occasionally. 

One of my current best friends commented on a post I wrote on a physics Facebook group. We eventually hooked up but soon realized we‚Äôre too similar to be together. But we both deeply love each other and he sends me memes and videos everyday on messenger which is very nice. 

I‚Äôm on hinge but haven‚Äôt gone out on a date since March 2019 because I‚Äôve only been seeing this Doctor , well, psychiatrist , who I know is also feeling himself and looking for a good catch like I do. He‚Äôs 48, very single , muscular and quite pleasant to look at so he‚Äôs going to set the bar really high. I guess I set mine higher after fooling around with this one and with the 10 year difference I know I can get a stallion and just move on.  

Hotel bars are my thing . I used to meet a lot of men by going out but it Depends really on what kind of guy you‚Äôre into. I personally go after guys with good breeding so UNited nations events, Ivy League parties , explorers club , investment events, etc. or just go to Dorrians or Sant Ambreous in UES? 

Idk were in the same predicament but I‚Äôm not into Divey and super artistic type of dudes so. There goes my choices narrowed down to .001 %"
