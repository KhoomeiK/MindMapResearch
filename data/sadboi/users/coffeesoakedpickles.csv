AskWomen,fqzygzb,t3_glj01f,1589778629.0,"i thought i was ""not like other girls"" for a while. I smoked and drank even i didnt want to-  they viewed me as the laid-back girl in our friend group, and hung out with other guys because ""there was less drama"". I pushed away dresses and sparkles or ""girly things"" cause i somehow put a lesser value on them. It was bullshit, obviously. I left that friend group and read a lot on women's studies. i talked with a lot of people and learned about the manic pixie dream girl trope and others. 

I love a lot of things mostly associated with masculinity, but i have a closet full of shirts and i fucking love glitter and baking and all that shit. I think most importantly though I've learned that I am most certainly like other girls, and I am grateful and proud of that.

I am an amalgamation of all of the strong, intelligent, and hardworking women that came before me."

While they can get very uncomfortable or annoying at times, theyre warm and fun to hold and wiggle when you move around. Plus, when youre having a good boob day- because lets admit it, thats a THING- boobs make you feel so sexy and hot. And they make nice pillows or holders for things like sauces and books. I like my girls."
AmItheAsshole,fmy3dgb,t3_fxth7t,1586477253.0,"YTA 1000%. Thats her grandma! grandma's give kids weird or playful nicknames from a place of love. Its a lovely name, in my opinion, but you cannot control every single nickname your child gets. And quite frankly, an individualized nickname from her grandmother may be something that she appreciates and grows to find heartwarming in the future. Not to mention, a nickname is not something worth ruining your relationship with your MIL and your daughter's relationship with her grandmother.

I have a short name, but my grandma and aunts from my extended family always elongate it with some form of repetition or addition of a childlike suffix (its a foreign name, so in my country most words are able to be grammatically changed to a child's liking). It may sound stupid to others, and it may be completely different from what my parents call me, but i LOVE those nicknames and the bonds they give me to my older family members. Not to mention, I would be so heartbroken and angry if my mother tried to bash my grandmother and break the bond we have over something as trivial as a nickname. 

Stop being a dick. Let your child have a sweet connection with her grandmother instead of bashing your MIL to the point where she no longer feels comfortable having a place in your daughter's life."

EatingDisorders,f50uik3,t3_dmhkpq,1571933066.0,"I don't know what to say other than I am struggling through the same thing. I have not been professionally diagnosed so I don't have the assurance from a therapist or doctor that it is a problem.  Because of this, when I go through bouts of eating more than I usually do I can't help but say that I don't have an eating disorder. I force myself to believe that, since I'm failing at restricting, I'm just on a really strict diet..?

AmItheAsshole,f4p34y4,t3_dl14rw,1571714679.0,"YTA 100% oh my GOD, i cannot even fathom being in a loving relationship with someone for over a decade and having the heart, or lack thereof, to force out one of their only comforts in a time of severe stress, agony, and fear. You are such a shitty person for feeling entitled to determine the circumstances with which your wife goes through labor and who she is able to enjoy that experience with. SHE is the one undergoing probably the most amount of trauma a human body can go through, psychologically and physically, and she wants to feel support from somebody who did it themselves and raised her, beyond that point- have some empathy for fucks sake. You have absolutely no right to say otherwise. And not to mention, in what world is the experience of bringing a child into the world solely for its parents? Im sure this varies person to person, but for the most part people agree that the birth of a child into a loving and kind family should occur in an atmosphere that mirrors what the child's family dynamic will be. Though that part is for the person birthing the child to decide."

I was extremely depressed and suicidal and I realized that faith, unlike science, only made me feel more alone. As I began to learn more and more and slowly step away from it all, i saw a lot of the hypocrisy and corruption within the church and eventually left altogether.
