CPTSD,f69cdte,t1_f68di3d,1572740060.0,"I am so sorry you had to go through that. People are cruel to others when it has nothing to do with the others... They are turmoiled inside whether they realize it or not and it makes me so so deeply sad that you had to experience that. Most of the times people like that tend to pick people like us because they know we will go the extra mile, etc... I've had experiences along the same lines at work. Supervisors who see I am quiet and will always say yes and they enjoy seeing how far I will go, like your case for a pointless end. I am so happy that you are able to write about this and hope you are in great peace and comfort right nowðŸ˜Š"
CPTSD,f699wbf,t1_f67njjj,1572738953.0,"I relate to this an your initial post so very much. Pretty much on the dot. I was able to push through the trauma as a child and writing was what I loved to do most even though I excelled at all classes, now I can see that it was possibly bc school was just mine, my parents couldn't touch me there so I put all I had into it. Same as you, unfortunately I lost that ability (once I had a larger much more traumatic experience and my body couldn't handle) to be articulate and my concentration is so hard to find. I ended up dropping out of college even though I managed to do well enough my last year in HS to get into a good program. 

Now in my 30s when my friends have established careers, I am not looked upon with admiration for what I survived and that I am a greatly kind human to all... Possibly I haven't met the right people, but it's hard. It's true that it is a societal issue, but I don't excuse people bc we have a mind of our own and choose what to think. Sorry for the rambles, direct message me if you'd like to talk, I find it hard to talk to friends about this, they just can't relate and also don't want to deal. I have faith we will find out way back! We do need to be our own positive motivators ðŸ˜Š"
CPTSD,f62271z,t1_f620vzn,1572651927.0,"I relate to you so much... It truly is so exhausting and at the same time it's my body's default so trying to not stress takes effort which we don't always have the capacity for bc the stress is so overwhelming! Such a vicious cycle.

I am trying slowly by trying to not feel guilty for doing things I enjoy... It's very hard because I always think why do I deserve a bath I have a, b, c to do. BUT I have learned that if I let myself have that treat of a bath, I will be more able to complete a, b, c... 

We will get through this! I know one day relaxation will and can be my default... Our neural pathways are so flexible, the beginning is so draining, but we just have to keep pushing ðŸ˜Š"
CPTSD,f5zdogu,t3_dprqd3,1572574133.0,"Congratulations!! The first thing I will say is don't worry about what your boss thinks... This process is for you and you need to put yourself first :) 

Think about some activities you normally wouldn't be able to do because of work or feeling guilty... I've been working on this for myself, getting over feeling guilty about playing with Legos or just enjoying a relaxing bath. For most of us, we didn't get to experience lots of moments of pure relaxation and I like to think about it as a necessity and not a want  when I feel guilty. Self care truly is something that is necessary for us especially and we will only grow stronger when we practice it more.

It's hard when I go out with others because most often the easiest conversation topic is work... I focus the conversation on what I am occupying my time with and sometimes that works to steer the convo in another direction too :) Best of luck, you got this!"
CPTSD,f5vl9rr,t3_dpg2h9,1572492141.0,"So happy for you!! I agree, it's hard to put yourself first sometimes but I realize we all need to and I am slowly trying to do it as well :) Keep listening to yourself!"
CPTSD,f5swcyz,t1_f5s29jg,1572444819.0,"That's exactly how I feel! Feel more like myself and especially relate to the being able to express myself better and not blow up... My bf and I have issues of me blowing up and it honestly is always whenever I am on a new med... In my break periods I am not perfect in communicating, but definitely able to keep  my cool and be as level as ever especially compared to when I'm on meds. 

Thanks for the comment! Helps me feel like I'm not aloneðŸ™‚"

I appreciate you reminding me of all these things, you are very correct. I am going through a tough couple of weeks and it's so easy to forget these key items. ðŸ’› I am in therapy for going on 10 months now ðŸ˜Š huge step and can't wait to keep progressing. Just have to keep moving forward!"
Employment,f4oq5bz,t3_d59tbx,1571705804.0,"I'm so sorry to hear you are going through this! First, I am glad you are not thinking about suicide any longer and if you are, please reach out to someone. Seeing how you are rationally removing yourself from that situation means that it is not you who is the issue or problem, but the environment is making things worse.

I am going through almost the exact same thing right now. I too realized that it's not worth any amount of money to be put through conditions like that. I too believe I may just not even give 2 weeks because I already know that it will only make my condition worse. Better things will come for you and me!!!"

CPTSD,f46jm23,t1_f45h62j,1571409645.0,"I definitely relate to the hard to believe part. I realize now that what helped was not focusing (which is really hard and I still am no where near perfect on) on fixing the PTSD, but making personal goals, self care being one of them...

CPTSD,f3wasi6,t1_f3rzxwk,1571196311.0,"I'm in an all too similar situation, I hope that you can find another job soon, I have stayed with my job far too long and it has only set me and my recovery process wayyy back... Triggers, harassment, etc. We deserve better! I'm so happy to hear you are taking care of yourself, I put work first for so long(2 years) and it wasn't even worth it.

Is it full time? Could you qualify for leave of absence to give yourself the freedom to schedule interviews? Best wishes!!"
CPTSD,f3waete,t1_f3t5yy9,1571196010.0," Sorry to hear that, I'm not in school right now but was before I was diagnosed and I know how much of a struggle it can be (I eventually had to leave)... 

BUT you got this!!! You know what you have, and that's a huge first step. What I have learned from therapy is that I shouldn't feel guilty doing self care, I used to so much that's why I would make myself suffer... I hope that you can see that in order for you to perform at your best, you need to indulge in some activities that satisfy you outside of school... Too much of one thing for anyone is bad and unhealthy... You are worth it, deserve it, and I have faith you will figure it outðŸ¤—"

ptsd,f2dnnv3,t3_dd0z8o,1570159182.0,"Hi, I have actually been on all of those medications myself. To be honest I've tried out so many I can't remember exactly how each one made me feel, but I have had the feeling you are describing about not being in your body.

From my almost 10 years of trying medicine, the best advice I can give you is give it at least 2 weeks if you can in order to see if the initial side effects wear off. Sometimes your body reacts initially in some ways at the beginning... UNLESS you truly just don't feel like yourself because (and this is just my opinion based on what I've learned for myself through the process) it isn't worth putting yourself through feeling other symptoms when medicine should alleviate original symptoms. I've been on medicine that's given me symptoms similar to PTSD if I understood what you were describing correctly (correct me if I'm wrong :) here to help and understand)

There's a lot of drugs out there so I'm sure you can find one that will work better for you :) Also, if your insurance will allow, there's pharmacogenomic testing now that will tell you and your doctor what medications your genome will react better to, so that can narrow the trial and error part down! Hope this helped :)"
