Mental and emotional responses are all usually indicative of an underlying issue, that's largely true, but how a person reacts to something as awful as what happened to you is an individual experience and cannot be the same for everyone across the board. If you think about it statistically, some of the victims were bound to end up the same way we have.

I would eat one meal and one snack with the PHP group, or at least the snack, if my school hours dictated that day's attendance. I mainly was there in the afternoon, for the end of day process group, and usually one other group - i.e. DBT, CBT, mindfulness, something artsy, etc. It was very effective for me because I would come out of inpatient and then go straight into PHP, and then step down to IOP - the transition was very slow for me. I needed that. I know that when I went and did PHP by itself, things were harder to get into the swing of, because the structure just was not there from the get go, and I felt thrown into a mix of things. However, if this is you only treatment option right now, I recommend giving it a shot and to be VERY communicative about your concerns that you've shared here.
