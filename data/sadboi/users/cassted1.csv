depression,ex4i6eh,t3_crc38a,1566005216.0,Exercising literally makes me feel worse. My moods energy and stamina decrease. I get moody and my nervous system freaks out. I still do it to stay cute but if I cant go to sleep shortly after watch out.

DDLGDiscussions,ew5vgrq,t1_ew5v9g4,1565146135.0,It sounds like we are in the same boat. I'm glad I'm reaching out here where people understand. Thanks for being so sweet.
DDLGDiscussions,ew5v9cr,t1_ew5rpsx,1565145983.0,"Thank you for your encouragement. I am in therapy have been for years now. It helps me a lot. It's been tough coming to terms that I have struggles but nothing is ""wrong"" or ""defective"" I just need to be with the right person when the time is right."
curlyhair,ew5v1qe,t1_ew5uwes,1565145828.0,No that's ok I'm not offended! I'm just trying to.figure out how to love my hair before I end up cutting it off. Its wavy the straight in some places. Nothing I do or try makes me feel confident.
curlyhair,ew5uac8,t1_ew5u8j5,1565145264.0,Appreciate (******
curlyhair,ew5u8j5,t1_ew5ton3,1565145228.0,This post is me doing nothing to my hair. The last post is when I tried the routine. My hair is wavy/awkward. I find a lot of straight hair products weigh my hair down and leave me looking like that lord of the rings character.... I applied you taking time to comment and help me <3
DDLGDiscussions,ew5txis,t1_ew5srx6,1565145005.0,Yes the bpd got sever with me too and I normally cope very well. He used my triggers to control me. I'm so sorry you went through this too. How are you healing?
curlyhair,ew5q3f6,t1_ew5pwrt,1565142321.0,"Yeah my hair can be straight or curly but nothing I try is giving me that ""damn I'm feeling myself"" vibe. I will post my wavy result tomorrow if you see it I'd love to know what you think."
DDLGDiscussions,ew5puh6,t1_ew5pkgo,1565142148.0,Thank you. Taking it one day at a time. I have bpd and PTSD so it intensifies these type of experiences. It also intensifies the way I love. Yes I did love him. I did everything in my power to make him happy.
curlyhair,ew5pl7f,t1_ew5of7q,1565141975.0,Yes check my last post if you can..I tried the routine. It worked as far as having curly hair but i dont think it was flattering. I will try doing the braids tonight. <3
curlyhair,ew5oa4c,t1_ew5ikvg,1565141083.0,I dont think I have curly hair either but the page said wavy also so I figured I would give it a try based on the before and afters I've seen from others. I'm basically just trying to find a way to like/style my hair. I'm sad that its thin and just sits there. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks love.
curlyhair,ew5ie54,t3_cmyiv0,1565137019.0,Do*
curlyhair,ew0skoj,t1_ew05e3c,1565004486.0,Thank you so so much! I will try this routine <3
curlyhair,ew03inb,t1_evzzppv,1564974717.0,Thank you I will try the creme <3
curlyhair,evzz9ax,t1_evzz07x,1564971285.0,What products do you like best? The gel is great to combat frizz and get shape but I feel like it makes it more obvious that I have less hair.
curlyhair,evzxxut,t1_evznw71,1564970255.0,Thanks I read everything and made a new post after trying the beginner routine. Let me know what you think! You're the best.
curlyhair,evzxvf4,t3_cm4rb8,1564970203.0,"Starting to feel like my hair is too sparse on the sides to do this. I also use rogaine. I co washed, put tons of gel in soaking wet, let it dry..scrunched out crunch and I simply dont think I look very attractive...trying to love the hair I have but insecure. Any advice will help."
curlyhair,evwjrvs,t1_evwjnak,1564865885.0,Thanks I appreciate you!
curlyhair,evwjgb3,t1_evwjd3c,1564865650.0,What products would you recommend? <3
BPD,evw9qfd,t3_clk50o,1564858676.0,Thank you. I remind myself I want love and safety not control. I'm aware of my behavior and capable of self reflection. It feels good not to be alone.
curlyhair,evw9kq9,t1_evv2jv9,1564858560.0,Thank you! I just scrunched my hair and tried not to brush it. I need a routine honestly. Shampoo conditioner and products. I know with the right products I could have pretty waves but it mostly falls flat. Pieces are completely straight while some are wavy. I look like I slept on it wrong most of the time. I feel disheveled. I wont cut it but I need something lol
curlyhair,evuofqj,t3_cld60c,1564801132.0,"My goal is pretty wavy shiny hair. 
I dont have a routine yet everytime I try scrunching I end up a frizz ball."
DDLGDiscussions,evdvcgh,t3_civ2nd,1564448438.0,I never felt like a child or cared for. I felt guilty for being sexual/sexualized. Its empowering to have choices and be cared for simultaneously. I am also diagnosed with bpd and being in this dynamic can be extremely rewarding in the sense that there is a lot of reassurance and I feel like someone's princess/world. I am willing to give everything because I want it in return. To be adored. It can also be extremely dangerous if the right person isnt chosen.
