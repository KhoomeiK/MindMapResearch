That's when I thought ""Oh, this is a Sleep paralysis episode"" and didn't think more of it. Then when I closed my eyes to fall asleep, that's when I immediately felt like I was being pulled up and felt like I was hovering over my bed. There was no support under my back and I felt like I was in the air. Also no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't wake up though while I was in this state. Usually you can wake up if you trt hard enough. I wasn't scared there and I thought the eyes were pretty, they were just looking at me.

I was always super loud, friendly and hyper active. Had a lof of friends and was always talking too much in class, that's what my teachers said. I have alwaaays cared about my hair, it's thick and a noticeable feature, which is pretty typical of Leo risings. I would always straighten it or put it in a pony tail, and if my I had a bad hair day, my day was ruined. That was me as a teenager. 

I became really depressed at 15 due to a traumatic experience. I really lost myself and this personality, plus all of my friends at that time due to depression. I know this sounds sad, but I want to see if other Leo risings have had a similar upbringing. Then from 15-22 pretty much depressed and not having healthy friends or being healthy myself. Was in and out of relationships a lot. Now I'm 23, I see a psychologist weekly, am starting to love sports again (I go running 2-3 times a week), I like being noticed by others, like if people check me out, I can feel my old personality come back again as well, like being positive, loud and dressing well.

astrology,fotbm14,t3_g7zkk4,1588049361.0,"Moon in Cancer in 12th house. (Most dominant planet in my chart)

First of all..there is a curse that goes with this placement that almost every moon in 12th house person deals with. That's having an unstable mother in childhood. Either she was absent emotionally/physically or the child took on the parenting role and the mother was more like the child.

***Mother issues***:  I remember when growing up my mom was depressed and slept her life away through my childhood. Very emotionally absent. I was the one who woke myself and my sisters up, made food for us and walked us to school every morning for a few years. I somehow felt responsible for doing that, as I knew nobody else would have done it otherwise. I also felt responsible for it if my younger sister didn't want to go to school, I had to literally wake her up like 5 times, and she would still not go to school.

So I did feel really alone because of this. My mom never acknowledged or appreciated that I did this, she didn't even notice. She probably wont even acknowledge this now. She stopped sleeping and started working when I was like 17, then I realized she was reeeally negative and abusive. I just moved out last month, being 22 as our relationship is really strained, and quite frankly..broken.

This is a common theme you will see with 12th house moons. Unstable dynamic/relationship between mother and child. Its probably related to Karma or a past life.

***Dreams***: Ever since I was a child I've always has wild and lucid dreams. I remember them every.single.morning. Reacurring dreams of being able to fly all the time and always as amazed when it happens. I always think ""I KNEW i could fly! I knew it! How could I forget this?"" lol, its weird. Dont know why I keep dreaming it. I have also had lucid dreams and astral projected once.

***Psychic***: I'm a bit psychic and a bit of a medium. But the lines there are really blurry. Its really hard to get a grasp of my talents there, if that makes sense. For instance, I have communicated with a ghost. Saw a ghost when I was 5 years old too. I have an intuitive feeling that there is something beyond this reality, an afterlife. I can communicate with my 2 spirit guides/angels. I even know their names. This sounds really woo woo, and I also thought this was my imagination before, but I embrace it now. 

***emotions***: I tend to think a lot about the past. My emotional reactions are very delayed and I often dont know how I feel. When I do know what I'm feeling, I'm veeery sensitive. When Im in a good mood I'm really creative, inspired and like to write poems and such. Im very much a loner and love being alone, as I dont really feel alone. I can be enjoying art, music, reading, writing, yoga, etc."
astrology,fot9ik4,t1_folcnhh,1588047829.0,"Cancer moon in 12th here too! Also struggling with my mother since I was a child. She was very absent in my childhood. She slept all the time and I had to wake my siblings up for school and walk with them to school every morning. Also my relationship with my mom has been strained and I don't really get her. I struggle with emotions a lot too. I have very delayed emotional reactions and seem flat sometimes. But, I think this placement has advantages too! I think this placement is the reaspn why I'm deeply spiritual, a bit of a psychic/medium, I just know there are other realities, I can sense my spirit guides and people who have passed. Alsoo, this placement gives you inspiration and a love of art and music. You can really get hypnotized easily in daily life, I dont really need drugs as I tend to go into a transe when playing instruments, etc."
