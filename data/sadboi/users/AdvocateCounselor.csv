egodeath,fr17juj,t3_glya7g,1589814736.0,That isn’t ego death although yes( some people are scared shitless as you say you felt ) I believe you had this experience though and that it did scare the shit out of you. But ego death although some of its stages aren’t terribly pleasant doesn’t leave you with the feeling you have. I personally suggest ( just my opinion btw ) that you do not do anymore LSD. I know of someone that did and they dissociated. It honestly sounds like that is what was happening. Now a lot of people have a hard time wether they are using drugs or not because they can’t accept what is happening. If you were facing this it could have been a part of ego death possibly. But ego death we don’t leave our body our body leaves us. People can be uncomfortable with this but I welcomed it. If you have another experience with or without drugs it goes much better accepting this. Ego Death is a death and at times it will feel like one. But then there is raised consciousness at the very least. Consciousness exists without a body. In ego death there “is no” body there is no pain. My experience was natural and there is a lot to it. I recommend to anyone to do this naturally and even then I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. If someone asks and are going through stages it’s different but people can get lost in the process in life or in death. Some people can’t find/see the light in life or in death. When you have ego death no matter how it’s perceived there is a feeling and a knowing that we are all connected. And this is minimum. There is a lot of possibilities. And work hasn’t ended. It’s a new beginning in many ways.

u_AdvocateCounselor,fqxirvn,t1_fqxhlma,1589732940.0,Absolutely when you took the test did it recommend what may be your wing? I remember you mentioning 9w1. Is that correct if so you have the same wing I typically have.

theology,fqx3u9m,t1_fqwzm7j,1589725176.0,We are “all” God’s Children; we are a part of God and we are children. We all have a lot to learn and have much love that we need in this world to evolve and to grow up. We are God’s children and we are all one in heaven. A part of God. ☺️
theology,fqx1km7,t1_fqwzm7j,1589723615.0,Exactly. Religion is often created by those who witness the one that has the intimacy with God not by the person who had the intimacy. Christianity in its beginnings was actually considered Pagan. If you are following Jesus you are following God but because Jesus loved God so much and wanted to serve God. We are all a part of God and God is a part of us. One God. ONE. We are one and end where we began. People following doctrine can also follow Christ but it is not one in the same. Humans don’t get to say how this goes truly. It isn’t up to us as we perceive it in life. Logic has many edit: holes and so do religions but there is only one God. All souls are a part of God. We all have darkness and light. Even the kindest people on the planet have ego and have darkness. The soul is the true self. Jesus knew his soul and he knew God. To love each other is also to love God. I try not to complain about this but it is a hang up of mine that I don’t like people telling other people where they are going or not going. We aren’t God we aren’t going to know. It’s Gods’ will. No one can dictate or maybe they can dictate but I promise that isn’t what Jesus was about. He’d welcome with open arms but I think he’d have something to say about how is name is being used to exclude people he would help. He was about love after all and so is God. In life and in death Jesus wasn’t understood. Think about it? 😍

u_AdvocateCounselor,fqwrml3,t1_fqweb5s,1589715301.0,"Sure. Mine is 2* 2w1. It was 5* 5w6. That doesn’t commonly happen but I think INFJs can have more than one center. And I think I was a 2w1 early childhood development changed towards the end of formative years. I couldn’t keep both paths though and I think 2 is my nature not just development. 
2s are of the heart, 2s are all about love, based in sadness. The sin of a 2 is pride. There are different kinds of 2s.We all have pride, shame, sorrow, humility and sadness. We often go blind to our own needs. We do have them though. It’s hard to admit we have them. Leo Buscaglia and Jesus were 2s 😂. I have a wing in 1. This means I have my own strong sense of what is right.I know however that their are many rights and many perspectives. 2s disintegrate to low 8 in times of unhealth/stress. I sometimes do this when I feel I need to protect someone or others. But this is also because of my sin of pride. In times of health 2s integrate to the high side of 4. There’s still sadness; it is a heart type. It is more confident and self accepting."

INFPs can be extremely intelligent and logical but everything is checked with Fi. Logic, behavior everything etc. is checked with Fi for an INFP. Fi is the lens they see logic thru."

MbtiTypeMe,fquv7fs,t3_gktqye,1589665050.0,There are some variables but I’m gonna go with one summary of some of them together and say that you are an ENFJ - self pres 2 and variate your wings.. 1 & 3 wings. But you also edit: disintegrate and integrate. You probably exhaust yourself and that can be a part of the self pres actually. As well as why I could see the head types as possibility but I think that is because you are self pres and you are ( smart )
MbtiTypeMe,fquu81i,t3_gktqye,1589664645.0,ENFJs actually have the same cognitive functions as INFJ. That’s why they were kinda leaning INFJ but most were in question.
MbtiTypeMe,fqutozh,t3_gktqye,1589664420.0,Hahahahaha I see other people are thinking about your personality type 🤣. They are not far off from my perspective. It ended as ENFJ or ENFP. Pretty much everyone agrees you are NF lmao!!!
MbtiTypeMe,fqutamz,t3_gktqye,1589664247.0,Now I’ll go look at what everyone else is seeing and then have another look at you 🤗.
MbtiTypeMe,fqus6zw,t3_gktqye,1589663776.0,If other it would be ENFP. Fe or Fi you are a feeler and intuitive.
MbtiTypeMe,fqurxx5,t3_gktqye,1589663669.0,I am a 2w1 so I’m seeing the 2 with my own perspective. I could very well be wrong but I do see you possibly as ENFJ which ENFJs are very 2 like and often have the enneagram type 2.
u_AdvocateCounselor,fqur7t8,t1_fququsd,1589663345.0,I see the dragon too but the dragon belongs to you ❤️.
u_AdvocateCounselor,fqur3et,t1_fququsd,1589663291.0,Lmao!!!🤣
MbtiTypeMe,fqupmzs,t3_gktqye,1589662651.0,Ok finally. I’m leaning with a 2 which could actually be with a wing in 1 or 3. I was seeing a wing in 3 at first but you also have a cerebral energy. The other one would be with a wing in 7 this probably isn’t because of a wing in 7 but could have something to do with personality type or especially integration or disintegration. I’d have to look into it further. Ultimately my (guess) is that you are a self pres.  2. There are different kinds of 2s. I’m a 2 but I’m not self pres.
MbtiTypeMe,fquoixe,t3_gktqye,1589662162.0,Yes I realize this is for enneagram I just got carried away!!! Lol. As far as enneagram I’m sure you are a 2 or have 2 as a wing. You could be a 9 perhaps. Or you could have a wing in n 6. But I have to read yet. I’m 2w1. And obviously INFJ. Sorry about drifting ahead with this. I will look at it as enneagram. 😘
MbtiTypeMe,fqumf9o,t3_gktqye,1589661238.0,"Ok I just ate and I haven’t looked yet but I will. However at a small moments ( sorry I’m an intuitive type INFJ and I doubt this jump I’m doing at first is correct ) glance ESFP occurred to me but because my Ni quickly showed me that you’re “not” INTJ. The image of metal letters that I often get from Ni has never flipped me an image like this where all letters were together and literally flipped around. This logically if you can see it as such implies the opposite of INTJ = ESFP. Though it did not show me ESFP. This was from only seeing your 2 words “Type meeeeeeeeee” lol. So I grabbed this video that Im sharing with you and now I’m going to look. But before I do I’m thinking ESFP or ENFP and a slight chance also of INTP. It could be something else entirely.. I’m about to see what I can find out. But the constant variable showing presently is that you are a (P).
[ESFP](https://youtu.be/LGQUrPGBKZA)"
u_AdvocateCounselor,fqujji4,t1_fquej0x,1589659955.0,Yes exactly like that it was the idea in putting them there. When I first painted them I was in the back yard. And although I’ve been to the ocean many times in my life looking at the clouds seemed easier. So I put images in them. There’s actually 5 images I believe. But at best someone else will generally see other images. I used to think that my images would translate to a degree but it is subjective and abstract. Even most of the images are symbolic and abstract. Meaning something to myself. If you want to know what they are intended I can tell you but it isn’t as fun as discovering what you discover on your own.. just like looking at clouds.
MbtiTypeMe,fqugexa,t3_gktqye,1589658554.0,Well you’re not INTJ and I haven’t even looked yet 😂. I’m going to look at it now. ❤️〰️❤️
u_AdvocateCounselor,fquarj2,t1_fqu1bsf,1589655337.0,"The ironic thing about this is that because INFPs tie patterns from various sources they have more structure. Your patterns have more structure generally speaking. 
I’ve seen this perspective of the past reflected in the music I post. Why INTPs are better at seeing this pattern than INFP you would know better than me. But it’s observable plus INFPs that I’ve known tend to be experimental and like sharing moments. The past is the past when it comes to social aspects for INFP. Why INTP see it better than INFP (generally speaking) I don’t know it likely in part has to do with preferences as it does also for INFJ. But “all”  of us see parts of the patterns of time. All intuitives. Its just we are looking at it from a bit of a different angle or different perimeter. It is the same thing however. INFJs tend to look at the future. We feel most at home intuitively speaking in the future. But honestly we feel most at home when it’s all of the above. Our reasons and yours. Time isn’t linear to INFJs especially when Ni is developed. But we’re human and are limited. Just as we all are."
u_AdvocateCounselor,fqu676h,t1_fqu1bsf,1589652803.0,"Ni = introverted intuition : INFJs Dom function. Ti our 3rd cognitive function is introverted thinking. 
Fe We feel you before we would feel ourselves. We care about your feelings but.......
When it comes to how we think we care more about it than what you think 😂.

A Ni Ti loop is different for some INFJs depending on our development. I can share them and differences sometime if you like but it may not matter to you 😁. But you should probably learn about cognitive functions in general.😘"
u_AdvocateCounselor,fqu5ied,t1_fqu1bsf,1589652421.0,There is pattern in repitition. INTPs are probably more likely to see it than INFP or INFJ. For INFPs you’ll have to figure out why.. I’m not sure but the reasons that INFJ won’t see it generally as clearly as INTP because we have a tendency to avoid it and because we like to avoid it by nature we miss the pattern to a degree but because INTP look to the past in what is existing they more easily observe the pattern that INFJ have access to but we don’t look there near as much as INTPs. We can and do however see them but it requires our attention. 😏
mbti,fqu13a0,t1_fqt67j0,1589649971.0,You would likely be good at it. Plus I’m INFJ and INTJ are often more competitive than INFJ. INFJ are competitive but it’s usually competition with ourselves. We don’t have to prove that we can do it only prove it to ourselves and because of this it isn’t necessary for someone else to be involved. It’s competition with ourselves after all.

mbti,fqtzmeb,t1_fqt67j0,1589649159.0,If you knew you could possibly be good at it. It’s strategy and multilevel thinking. I used to play it with my baby brother when he was around edit: 8 or 9 because I must’ve been around 28 it was my portable and very small chess set and I remember teaching him 😍.He has high functioning autism. He’s brilliant funny and sweet. My mom was going to rehab and I was taking care of him and my grandpa. They didn’t get along.. to much alike. My baby brother would come in asking me to play chess with him and my Grandpa would yell “ get him outa here!” They would vie for my attention. It was lovely 😶. But I enjoyed them both.

mbti,fqtyyje,t1_fqsz4gp,1589648797.0,To an extant that is true. Some it is simply just their style though. Hi cousin 👋🏻
u_AdvocateCounselor,fqtw0ck,t1_fqtulze,1589647192.0,Yes and this is why I don’t have any control whatsoever of our current fate. People will only make it worse and in some cases it can even manifest the events that will happen. People are not seeing the big picture.. well some people are but it can be very daunting. I knew the pandemic was coming and I couldn’t do anything. It was fate. The terms that I’ve come to presently is what can be changed is many variables in the further the possible outcomes are. It requires distance and looking ahead. But we can’t get there from here. New fate requires new momentum and has to occur in the futures past. This means that the momentum that has begun many times before has to be maintained through multiple generations. The rod of truth has to be passed along during our journeys otherwise the cycle continues as it has. And it’s funny but I have had Ni Ti loops reflecting this haha. To change fate requires our free will obviously. Free will and fate exist simultaneously.
mbtimemes,fqtv08e,t3_gkmzke,1589646639.0,So contd... If I didn’t know what it was I would look for examples of it and see what my take if it is rather than google what it is. I don’t like the google it mentality 🤣. But hey we all have to start somewhere and at least we’re not blind to learning even if it’s through googling. And that’s better than not learning.. I think 🤔
mbtimemes,fqtukua,t3_gkmzke,1589646403.0,I hardly ever ever ever Google lmao! In fact I’m a little insulted when someone tells me to do it😂. It’s a hang up I have to get passed and it’s important not to be offended. No ones perfect. But seriously we need to use our own heads. 💁🏼‍♀️
u_AdvocateCounselor,fqtsxi9,t1_fqtryvj,1589645480.0,True. I have seen many variables. But no matter when and where ; what point we are at- the most positive possibilities always have to do with ( love ) compassion. We haven’t been here very long relatively speaking. We’ve made many many mistakes. It’s bad enough that we don’t learn well enough from the past but even worse that we don’t look further ahead. The problem we’re facing is that we don’t see ourselves in global unity. If we were evolved people would have had empathy for people in China before the pandemic came. When someone hurts we hurt. We have a long ways to go. Even many that have raised consciousness although they can learn to get passed this the normal response is often enjoying the bliss. For myself. I miss this unity and love but to me being connected means we are connected with those that are suffering and in pain. To love love is beautiful but what does it mean when people are forgotten that are suffering? It means we haven’t evolved yet.
u_AdvocateCounselor,fqtrcpi,t1_fqtpipi,1589644604.0,Exactly. The synesthesia though is genetic but obviously not all synesthetes are INFJ 😂. However we can be traced through families of synesthetes. It’s genetic. Many aren’t aware because they don’t have someone else’s perspective to compare. But synesthesia has purpose in our evolution. Artist and musicians etc. are more commonly likely to have synesthesia and music is important to our evolution collectively. It’s sad to me that these things are so neglected in schools. The world is not very balanced presently.
u_AdvocateCounselor,fqtpbzd,t1_fqtnvma,1589643458.0,INFJs are related. Probably it is intuitives as well but without any doubt INFJs are. Some family isn’t always good family though haha
u_AdvocateCounselor,fqtp2ck,t1_fqtnvma,1589643306.0,I do that with food lol. Synesthetes are often artists and intuitives. I used to dance with shapes all around me. In my 20s I would often see it as a cut crystal prism and it would move with me while I would bounce off the surfaces. I have a number of synesthesia some not always pleasant. But it has evolved. Synesthesia isn’t something we control though. I just utilize it when I can utilize it. Sometimes it has real purpose. I have an ideasthesia that I love where I see relationships in art. Images etc. ideasthesia is something we all have but it is related to abstract thinking. A lot of INFJs have synesthesia. Not all of them are aware of it that’s all but in discussion they see them. Synesthesia is genetic btw. MBTI has nothing to do with it. Lol.

u_AdvocateCounselor,fqthf56,t1_fqtfz8h,1589639054.0,"It is intentional but the process of seeing them an creating them is Ni. Just like in communication I have to translate Ni. I see the images before I paint them and it’s as if the painting the images are already there I just have to paint them. It’s Ni but it’s aware right from the beginning. It also has to do with synesthesia. I see colors in colors it itself isn’t a synesthesia but it’s related to synesthesia. Many synesthetes see more colors. 
I’ve never had a lesson in painting. Not even 1. But my synesthesia shows me the colors that make up the colors. I’ve been artistic all my life but have probably done a handful of paintings ( aside from painting props and sets for theatre) that I’ve done. I always give them as gifts so I have none of them 😂. When I was young and sketching etc. I showed promise 😉. But I always saw imperfections in this sort of form of art. As I’ve gotten older I see the beauty in imperfection I actually intend a mistake towards the very beginning just to get past perfectionism and feel free from critic lol."
infjhome,fqtg8gh,t1_fqtfsye,1589638383.0,Often I start with the abstract image. Like an orchid I painted has a shaman or priest like image in the center of the orchid.

I had a dream that my arms and hands were where my legs and feet should be and my legs an feet were where my arms and hands should be: I had fuchsia pumps on and a very nice fuchsia handkerchief dress on= fuscia isn’t a great color for me the closest I’d want to get to it is a berry haha. And I’m walking around on my hands in an environment full of people. 😶I still laugh when I think about this dream.
infjhome,fqqu394,t1_fqqs9hu,1589571977.0,I love it 🥰
infjhome,fqqu0gu,t1_fqqs44e,1589571937.0,I agree. Lovely. It’s funny I really like triangles but am not particularly fond of squares probably because of your same reason. Paisley is beautiful. 💗
infjhome,fqqtm0d,t1_fqqsjtx,1589571730.0,"No,serious. It was in mid to late teens. I wasn’t sleeping much; lol. It wasn’t pleasant but I think that the Gazebo represented the institutionalism. I think it was a fear. Not of fire. It’s weird. 💁🏼‍♀️"
ENTPandINFJ,fqqrd8x,t1_fqqc3fo,1589570580.0,Actually it looks like we’re on the same wavelength. I would be happy to be your mentor. But I am learning and have no mentor myself. I do however quite often help people find what they already have. But I want connection and not to be followed. What I mean is I want you to find what you need. Each person has their own truth and beauty. You find this within. But we can journey together from time to time if you’d like? We all have our own journeys though and I would want you to blossom as only you can. Your light will shine brightest if it is your own. 💕
ExistentialSupport,fqqq5hi,t3_gkain7,1589569956.0,Edit: It’s as much the beginning if not more. There is no beginning and end because the beginning and end are the same. We end where we came from. We begin after the end. Time just isn’t linear. Actually let me explain further. Humans have an internal clock. This makes it easier for us to navigate but time as time truly is is not our time. It doesn’t work the same way we perceive it. To truly experience time is beyond our ego and beyond our perception. This internal clock dies when we die. I think we experience time as time is or at least as much as we can conceive of it. It is like raised consciousness. Time flows around us and through us. It is very abstract I’m aware but with our limitations it’s as close as I can get to what I think happens 😉.
infjhome,fqqjf47,t1_fqqd1ph,1589566565.0,What is your favorite shape and least favorite shape?? 😁

Edit: The Dance of Sheva statue dancing. This was common around the age of 3-4

I was around 9 and it was me but  I was someone else it’s hard to explain. But I was a little girl and I was dancing ballet with a little boy the studio was stories high and I could see the buildings from outside. A woman comes in seeming very distraught ( it felt like we were in trouble) . Everything was in another language ( perhaps Russian) but in my dream we understood each other. I would wake up crying every time and I never knew why.

Burning alive in a white gazebo.. that one was lovely. Though that was in teens the rest are mostly very early years.

I’ve tried asking this question before 😂. So I thought I’d share with you. These are only the reoccurring dreams I remember.

I’ve had dreams of atomic bombs but they often represent something positive. Sounds weird but it means something other than destruction. 🤷🏼‍♀️obviously there’s the dreams of flying too. I would control it by my breathing by breathing out.. it’s kinda like sinking to the bottom of water but in reverse going higher. I still do this often with my white cat. Lololol"
infjhome,fqqiklc,t1_fqqd1ph,1589566140.0,What were your childhood reoccurring dreams?
infjhome,fqqfv4t,t1_fqqd1ph,1589564802.0,Hi you 💗
theology,fqq4vrv,t3_gk8fnv,1589559440.0,Thanks for sharing hon. It really is all about love and global unity. In God we are one. In love we are one. God is love and light and a part of all of us as we are apart of God. It is the same God 😉.
Synesthesia,fqpdc05,t3_gk25ds,1589543280.0,I love this Thankyou for sharing 😊.
Synesthesia,fqpdabg,t1_fqon4a4,1589543241.0,It is fascinating isn’t it?
