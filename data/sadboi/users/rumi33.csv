bipolar,eptervk,t3_bvvq9s,1559488657.0,"wow it is crazy how much i can relate to this. It also reminded me of the way I approach not only bipolar but also the world. I have a tendency to see things black and white. As in something is either really good or really bad. I either love something or hate something. It is something i struggle with quite often because i categorise people thoughts etc. very quickly and miss those ""grey areas"". Anyone else feel like that?"
bipolar,epn956w,t3_bv7ofg,1559323635.0," My doc told me both lithium, post-manic/ hypomanic phase and anti-psychosis can make your thoughts a bit cloudy for a while.  I was diagnosed BP1 after a severe manic episode that ended up in a hospital. I felt like a total idiot for at least 6 months I was on lithium.  To cope with it I played sudoku, memory games, video games etc. I started painting and playing the conga and read way more. Basically I wanted to train my brain from all aspects art math etc. I am not sure if it really helped. I think its just my body finally adapted to medicine after 6-8 months. Now I am doing Masters in Geosciences and keeping up with the work! 

Regardless,  I think doing something about a problem always give you a confidence boost instead of just waiting for your body to adapt to pills. In any case,  you should talk to your doc about the symptoms and dont skip miss the blood tests. They check the major side effects. 

 p.s.  since lithium is like salt (hence dry mouth and dry skin) you should drink a lot more water than usual!!!   

Also remind yourself even tho lithium may have side effects we are one of the lucky ones. Because lithium doesnt work for everyone and the alternatives are not as effective."
