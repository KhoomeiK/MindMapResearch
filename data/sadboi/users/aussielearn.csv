bodyweightfitness,f7be2eq,t3_dv73lm,1573566242.0,"Using BMI to get a ballpark figure (shouldn’t rely on these too closely) your overweight. And I would get that same  conclusion looking at your picture. Therefore bulking wouldn’t make sense, as we want less weight or at least less fat.

So based on that, you’re going to want to ‘cut’. But I would have to say I’m personally against ‘dieting’. You shouldn’t feel like your restricting yourself or changing your ways for a limited time. You want to live a healthier life, so you do that by making healthy decisions. Even if they start off small and inconsistent. Focus on the bigger picture of developing healthy habits, and your body weight will come down naturally. 

Exercise is obviously important, and just doing something for 30 minutes everyday is a good start. Consistency is key. Go for a walk, run or swim. Do some work outs. Whatever makes you happy and keeps you motivated."

Worst I received: Setting up a tent as it gets dark, I call out for a tent peg but then find one and continue my work. Brother calls out my name, I look up and get smacked in the head with the tent peg he has decided to throw. 

I hold my head where it hurts but don’t think it’s that bad.
