For instance, when Eden was caught with Isaac, she was basically given the choice to repent and save her life. She wouldn't be allowed to go back to Nick as an econowife but because she's a young adulterer, she'd become a handmaid.

AskReddit,fqrem9n,t3_gjpjxk,1589582841.0,"My ex best friend and I met in the 3rd grade (we're both 24 now). We started hanging out because we lived in the same neighborhood and shared a love of tamagotchis and the Sims. She'd always been pretty clingy but never anything I couldn't handle.

As we got older, I was dealt a pretty shitty hand. I was bullied relentlessly in middle school and developed an eating disorder that I'm still battling today and was raped in the 8th grade and sexually assaulted by a 30-something year old in the 9th grade. So, as a result, I started doing drugs and drinking and this lasted until I was about 22 (I'm now two years sober and almost 2 years clean).

The thing that started tipping me off was when we were about 17. I opened up about the sexual assaults and, less than a month later, she started telling me her bf at the time was raping her. I knew this guy, and that just didn't sit right with me but I comforted her and stood by her. 

Then, when she found out about my eating disorder, she started trying to starve herself and overexercise. After about a week, she started complaining about how she was ""so anorexic"". Okay, kinda odd but... Maybe she's really dealing with this. 

Next was the alcohol. When she found out about my alcoholism, she would start texting me saying she drank three nights in a row and she was such an alcoholic. All she wanted was alcohol and she needed it to survive. This started to annoy me.

The last thing was the drugs. Again, she learned of my drug addiction and suddenly, she was snorting her mood stabilizers and ""getting so high"" and ""craving heroin"". 

Sprinkled in between all of this was her claiming abuse after I escaped an abusive relationship and how, suddenly, all of the guys who broke up with her were abusive and rapist assholes. 

I finally had enough when her (now ex) boyfriend told me that I only hung out with her for money and I was a bad friend. I told him that yes, I was waiting for her to give me money, but only because I sold her an expensive vape and I'd given her over 3 months to pay me back. He didn't respond for a while and then texted me back saying he was sorry for accusing me of being a bad friend and that I needed to watch out for her because she had a complex with me and wanted to *be* me. 

So, yeah, I ended that friendship and haven't spoken to her since."

With my hard work and my professors' help, I managed to finish 3 of my 5 classes early and ended up with 147% in one class, 102% in other, and a 99.89% in the third one.

3. I get to spend more time with my workaholic dad. We live together but when he was going to work, the only time we spoke was at dinner and even then, it was a quick meal then back to work. We now cook together, hang out a lot more, watch TV, etc.

AnorexiaNervosa,fnzwd9l,t1_fnxl6wq,1587401893.0,"Exactly! And the thing about puberty is that you're going to awkwardly gain weight but by the time you're an adult, it's going to fill out the way it's supposed to.

I was supposed to be a lot taller than I am now (5'5.5"") and I'm actually slightly shorter than I was when I was 14/15 (thank you anorexia and 11 years of competitive cheerleading for destroying my spine and knees) because of all the damage I've done.

But that's what we have to remember in recovery! When we gain weight, it's going to be awkward, it's going to sit in places we hate at first, but as time goes on, that weight will distribute evenly and it'll look natural :)"

AnorexiaNervosa,fnxj381,t1_fnxhxat,1587339683.0,"I totally get that, it's the same with me! My family has dealt with my relapses over and over (along with alcoholism and drug addiction--the only times I've been ""recovered"" from my eating disorder) and I can't tell you how many times I've been told ""you're too old to be doing this again!""

But we have to be gentle with ourselves. It's not something we chose, it's just who we are, we just have to learn how to fight it and remain strong.

It's probably why this round of recovery is so rough on our bodies, too! As a teen, we could bounce back from it pretty ""easily"" (it wasn't easy by any means but you know what I mean) but as adults... It's a lot more difficult. And this virus sure as hell isn't helping the situation!"
AnorexiaNervosa,fnx8sp0,t1_fnwhwfm,1587333745.0,"I completely agree! It's not even just the weight gain that's bad, it's your body trying to get back to normal after being deprived of nutrients for so long. Unfortunately, if you're like me and doing this on your own (i.e. not in residential treatment, no doctors/nutritionists/therapists/etc.), it's going to be a bit worse because we don't have all the things that can help ease the ""growing pains"". Speaking of... I'm 24 and I'm pretty sure I'm going through puberty again because this last relapse was so bad... It's nuts.

BUT! I have some ways to help ease your pain!

1. Gummy probiotics AND vitamins! Don't do ""hard"" ones, your body won't be able to process them well and it won't feel good (nausea, cramps, dizziness). The probiotics will help with like... 80% of the gastro issues. You're not going to feel incredible and 100% healed but you'll feel *better*.

2. Listen to your body. If you're tired, sleep. If you're hungry, eat. If you're full (and I mean *really* full, not the full we tell ourselves we are after two rice cakes and two bottles of water), stop. If you feel sick, take medicine. If you're thirsty, drink water. Just listen to your body, it knows what it needs.

3. It's okay to fall back into old habits, it's okay to ""slip"", and it's okay to need help. It's all part of the recovery process and recovery is NOT easy.

4. Let yourself have treats! Seriously, nothing is nicer than a nice piece of chocolate after an exhausting day. 

5. Give yourself time to heal. You're not going to feel better overnight. Think about how long you've been dealing with this disorder... It's going to take even longer for your body to recover. And that's okay! Just know that relief will come in bits and pieces and you'll be feeling great before you know it!

Good luck, loveü§çü§çü§ç"

I agree, though. I've been through the refeeding process a few times and I always forget how bad it is until I start it again... I really hope this misery sticks with me so I don't relapse ever again!"
AnorexiaNervosa,fnw03dj,t3_g45xx8,1587308663.0,"Acne, joint pains, below the waist issues, dizziness while eating... 

Yeah, it's hell. Absolute hell. 

But I look at it like this: a couple months ago, I was afraid to fall asleep because I was afraid my heart was going to give out in the middle of the night. I couldn't enjoy baths because I knew what would happen every single time I tried to get out. I couldn't walk up stairs without my heart going all wonky. Driving was terrifying because my blood pressure liked to drop while I was on the highway going 75mph. 

Now? Yeah, I'm uncomfortable as fuck. I'm angry. I feel awful. But I feel a million times better than when I was dead on my feet!"
AskReddit,fnsxs1b,t1_fnsxfy0,1587230821.0,"Oh, you're absolutely right, a lot of it has to do with control! Mine stemmed from bullying (I hit puberty a *lot* earlier than my classmates and they decided to rip me to shreds for it. I still panic if my boobs are larger than an A-cup) but I realized later that the reason why I *still* struggle with it is because I need to feel in control and ""good enough"" (perfectionism).

I hope you're doing okay with all that's going onü§ç"
