depression,etstock,t3_cd6d58,1563155240.0,Yes for sure. I’ll have a couple of days (or hours) where I feel great and myself again and then all of the sudden it just gets evaporated and I’m back to square one.

AskReddit,es29j58,t3_c5hyh4,1561517573.0,"My mental health. I’ve been in a cycle going in and out of severe depression and anxiety. I’ve been hospitalized and I have survived multiple suicide attempts. I haven’t had a normal adult life yet and I’m in approaching my late twenties. I’m worried the cycle will never end.

EDIT: wow thank you for all the support. The reddit community can be really amazing. I’m struggling and don’t want to give up, but it’s difficult to not see an end to all of this. I will be taking steps to try to break this cycle. All I want is a normal and stable life— I think we all do."
