The piece of advice that helps me the most:  **Writer's write.**

How I put that maxim into practice:

1. **Create a daily writing habit.** Writing is a skill like any other. It requires practice. Make it a daily thing, even if it's only 5 minutes. It's a start. If you haven't already read [On Writing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10569.On_Writing) by Stephen King, I highly recommend.
2. **It's okay to write garbage.**  It's *necessary* to write garbage. When you accept that, you no longer have to be afraid of your daily writing session. If what you scribble down is crap so be it. The habit is not ""writing a Pulitzer winner"". The habit is writing. And that leads to number 3
3. **Every first draft is perfect because all the first draft has to do is exist.**

I'm curious:  how much money does an individual need to have in a savings account before they're allowed to have a pet? 4,000? 10,000?

Keeping in mind the average American has less than 5k in savings, that would be a harsh prerequisite.

Let's go with 5k, just for funsies. What happens during emergencies? Example:  I have 10,000 in savings and my car breaks down, costing 3,000 to repair. Well, I've still got 7k in the bank, so under the Congrajulations standard, I'm still allowed to own a pet. Phew. Close one.

But let's say this happened in 2008 and there's a recession looming. A month after that emergency car repair, I'm out of a job and I've lost my health insurance. Thank dog we've got savings, but my family's burning through that fast and we've got no way to replenish it in the near future. 

We're cutting all nonessentials, postponing bills as long as we can, maxing out every credit card. We're falling behind on the mortgage and ruining our credit score, but we're keeping the lights on and keeping everyone, including Fido, fed.

I was responsible and had pet insurance, but I can no longer afford the monthly premium, so the policy has to lapse. Fido is now uninsured, just like his human family. 

And then the worst happens. A unpredictable medical emergency. We rush to the vet. We don't have insurance any more. We have nothing left in savings after months of unemployment. The vet explains the options. We max out our last credit card to give our beloved friend a peaceful passing and go home to an empty house to mourn.

But according to you, we didn't deserve to have the dog in the first place. What selfish people, right?

This isn't a sob story, it's freaking reality for millions of people living in a society that lacks affordable health care, worker's rights, and fair pay. In a cruel and selfish system, people can properly care for their pets, plan responsibly, and still be faced with tragic decisions."

When asked what he would like his legacy to be in one word, Bernie answered ""compassion"". Compassion. Something utterly lacking in your comment.

You say this person is selfish for not being able to make a huge sum of money magically appear. An asshole for being forced to watch their dog die from a medical illness because they could not afford to save them. A tragedy due to unfair economic conditions makes them a 'selfish asshole' according to you. 

So instead of showing empathy, understanding, or hell, even silence, you chose cruelty. What does that make you?"

In that 50 minutes, I take a bus, ride on a crowded metro train, walk up 4 sets of escalators, and ride 2 elevators. If you add in a bakers dozen of non automatic doors and a 10 minute walk, I am likely to touch my face at least once after touching a public surface. 

Where exactly am I washing my hands in this scenario? I'm not. So I'm using hand sanitizer. And common sense."
