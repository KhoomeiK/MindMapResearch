She would have been able to roam around in a bikini in any of the resorts, however, she chose to stay in an inhabited island where there are specific rules about bikini to prevent exactly this kind of situation. This would have not happened had she obeyed the officers asking her to cover up, theres been a lot of incidents where police approach tourists and let them know of the rules, cordoned off beaches with signs explicitly stating that it is a ""bikini beach"" are specially made for tourists, the travel agent is supposed to inform tourists of the situation on arrival. Oh well, fingers crossed this never happens again."
worldnews,fh8i4aq,t1_fh8e79h,1581360215.0,"Here is a video of the cops informing her the situation without even touching her. See who makes the first contact. See who is acting like an entitled bitch. Theres millions of tourists visiting the place, wearing bikini's and what not. They all follow the laws. Wearing a bikini didn't prompt her arrest, indecent exposure at a school zone, refusing to obey law enforcement and assaulting while under the influence lead to the arrest.

bipolar,eqptpry,t1_eqpt8z8,1560204246.0,"I've learnt that there are two categories of finances, stuff that I absolutely have to pay/buy including rent, bills and water.

My mind saw suicide as the only way out of the pain. You know what was different about you and me? I had money in my account, I was successful, I had a perfect career, I had everything, yet my mental illness made me want to kill myself. It's been three years since then, I would NEVER give up. Right now, I don't have a cent to my name, don't really know how to afford food tomorrow, but you know what? I'm happy, i'm happy as fuck. Don't let this fuckwad of a disorder make you give up, the reason you see now is NOT the reason why you'd want to end it. It's bipolar disorder, please, don't succumb to it. I am a little under-informed about your financial situation but, is there really nothing you could do to improve finances? even if it means borrowing?"
