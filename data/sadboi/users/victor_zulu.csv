Some of the things I can think of that it might be/ things to consider:

- Trauma and stress can greatly affect our memory
- Different parts of our brain playing up (maybe lack of blood flow to certain areas or an increase in adrenaline) can affect our memory in different ways, eg. the amygdala going nuts after trauma
- Medication, either coming off of or beginning any type of medication for mental health can affect the way we think
- Being in a state of hyper or hypo arousal
- Fight or flight responses
- The amount of stress going on in different areas of your life eg. counseling, relationships, diet, study, work, disturbed sleep or lack of sleep, physical illness
- Dissociating, disassociation. Having episodes of derealization

I hear you, I really do. As a sufferer of child abuse, severe CPTSD, depression, and anxiety, I resonate with the idea you have. But I've found it's unhelpful to tar everybody with the same brush by assuming others are depressed etc. because if repressed trauma. 

This is because of my experience with people who suffer all kinds of mental health troubles who either know my story and say ""wow, nothing bad even happened to me - I feel like my depression doesn't count"" or people who I've actually asked what happened to them, like, really what happened.. and they genuinely did not have any traumatic event happen. 

This is only my opinion, but it took so much for CPTSD and PTSD to even get recognised as a legitimate diagnosis after Vietnam that it's simply necessary to keep it as a particular diagnosis on it's own, matching the criteria for diagnosis.

I agree with you, literally everybody has trauma, and yes everyone is traumatised - just to varying degrees. Traumatic responses are normal until they become CPTSD/PTSD. Just like grief is a normal response unless it becomes complex grief. The same as everyone is sad, but to varying degrees, and not ever has depression.

I had similar thoughts to you on the matter as well at one point, but yeah this is how it's worked out in my mind nowadays.

Something that I think is worth knowing when it comes to depression (and in my case PTSD and depression in particular) is called the ""window of tolerance"" along with two states of mind called ""hyper-arousal"" and ""hypo-arousal"".

Making sure you don't stay isolated when you're depressed or have any other mental health stuff going on is one of the hardest but most important things. I know it sounds like more of a masculine thing (I'm female) but I had it ingrained in me from a super young age not to show my feelings or emotion. Especially not to talk about it. Other people? Totally fine. I have no judgement. I even grew up knowing how important good communication was. I just didn't realise how big the walls I built were until I finally found out the hard way it was keeping the good things out too.

I'm not sure if it's just because I got a bit older and realised how badly it was affecting me, but I have some friends now that I actually met in hospital and we all said the same thing; that having friends we all made at our worst who are pretty unphased by mental health talk was one of thee biggest difference in our lives. Because none of us have to monitor what we talk about, we can casually mention anything from anxiety to idle chit chat like learning to knit to feeling suicidal and stopping by the emergency department and it's like we don't have to wear a mask. We don't feel exhausted after being in contact with each other, not in the way we all feel after 'keeping up appearances'. We can even laugh our asses off about the serious stuff. And there's no judgement just kindness and respect.

TLDR; yeah, I really do agree."
depression_help,fizv5mb,t3_faku17,1582876036.0,"Yes, it really does get better. 

All of those things you're feeling are classic depression. It's all very normal to experience these side effects and symptoms when we have depression. It's not going to be 'normal' forever though, in fact depression makes us feel abnormal. It strips us of our joy, simple pleasures, motivation, self esteem, and hope. 

Life does not stay that way though. Life is always precious and worth living, and days can and will feel enjoyable again. I know it might not feel that way now, but I swear it won't be for nothing and you will in your own time recover.

Even if it doesn't feel this way, keep telling yourself during the bad times ""This is only temporary, things have to and *do* get better, life is never *all* bad. This feeling is temporary. I am not my feelings. This is temporary.""

Depression is like a cloud or fog over all of it and we forget what it's like to live outside that dark miserable mist.  is unfortunately the nature of the beast. In knowing this, though, we can fight it and recover even better than before. It's not you - it's depression. It does get better, I promise you. It might not feel like it, but it does.

If there was anything at all that would start to help you feel better, what would it be?

What do you do when you need a healthy way to take your mind off things? Do you enjoy doing anything, have any hobbies, or any current coping techniques you like?

Do you have anybody at all who you could just talk to? Somebody who can be there for you?

The 'too long' part..
I've gone through my own dark, dark times and they lasted years, too; it makes me wish I could wave a magic wand for anybody else who's been in even a remotely similar situation so they wouldn't have to go through the pain. Sometimes the only way to get through something is by just going through it. The whole ""when you're going through hell, don't stop there; keep going"" thing. I know hearing that doesn't help. But. I say it anyway because I know I experienced too many times myself where I had to be too strong for too long all on my own. At times when I was suicidal, I needed hospital. Other times the only thing that got me through was repeating it over and over to myself that the pain was only temporary. When it gets that bad - it is always, always temporary. That was my compass during some very dark times. It's only temporary for you, too - hang in there. It does get better, and I believe in you. It does get better and it will. Remember a lot of what you're feeling is also classic depression. It's very real. And it's making things very hard. Just don't ever believe it's permanent - life gets better.

What you're feeling is actually really understandable. 

It's normal to feel angry. 

It's normal to feel all kinds of anger and frustration especially when things keep going so wrong, on such a big scale, for such a long time, and when things are just plain unfair. I'd be angry too.

Righteous anger is important.

The choice you have is how you handle the anger and what you do with it. You will always have the choice about what you do with your anger and any intense emotions and feelings you have. Always. What you do with it. Is a choice. 

You're in control of it. It's powerful and if you choose to not let it make you bitter, but to take you to a better place, a place where there's a little more order in your chaos, then let you're anger take you there.

What I'm reading tells me you don't want to get into crime and act out and cause harm and chaos out of sheer psychopathy. You have a moral conscious about it and wouldn't even be posting this if you didn't.

What I'm reading makes sense, and it tells me you feel completely fucked over and you're sick of it. That you want to fight back. That you'd like more control. That you have motivation. That you feel very normal human emotions. That you want to feel more positive thoughts and feelings through better life situation and experiences.

Please don't let what's unjustly happened to you be the unraveling of the rest of your very possible future. Don't let blind rage, apathy, fear or anger rob you of your very own future.

You matter and it does get better. Sometimes it gets better painfully slowly. Don't give in. Don't give up. Challenge yourself. 

Find an outlet worthy of who you are as a person. Do something respectable with it, because you're a respectable human being that ought to command respect for yourself. Don't give in. Be righteous.

I'm thinking of you, and my heart goes out to you. I hope you're ok, and if I could help more, or if I could help at all, I truly would.

This was a time I legitimately thought I was going to die. 

The strangest part was the unexpected reaction of shock that I experienced when I realised I had lived through it. I so thoroughly believed I was going to die, and I was so full the most intense fear and hopelessness I've ever experienced in my life that it wasn't an easy transition to make. I

It was an actual moment that was delayed, that I had to eventually have, and I felt sadness and disconnect at the fact I wasn't feeling ecstatic happiness or relief or anything like that.

selfharm,fitc05w,t3_f9fbv6,1582714113.0,"I started cutting when I was 11. I don't know how the hell I even came up with the idea. I'd never seen it heard of self harm before.

I experienced trauma and some of the reasons I believe I did it are:
- possibly the need to be in control of my own body
- to mame myself so others might be repelled or get the message never to touch me again
-to take my mind of the deafening and intrusive thoughts I had
- to feel something other than mental pain, to punish myself
- to decide when the pain happened and then to be able to tangibly take care of it after
- that maybe just someone would save me from it all even though I self mutilated in places I could hide
- perhaps the occasional effort to get back to reality when I was dissociating
- I did it again and again because the sense of relief happened, somehow, and it was often my only relief
- it didn't fix or solve anything but it sure as hell beat being shamed whenever I asked a parent for help or to listen to me, and later on it was the detour to a less dangerous route through pain instead of killing myself

Can't be certain, but this is more or less what makes sense to me and I know I probably would have ended up there at age 11 even if I did have a warning not to ever even try it. While I know it's not at all ideal and I'd never wish it upon anyone, I've almost done a decriminalisation of it in my own mind and in my own opinion. People who do drugs are more often than not trying to escape some form of pain. Cutting is the same. It just leaves behind different track marks, different damage. I can't change the permanent scarring. It just is what it is. If it works as a cautionary tale to others, that's fine. 

Otherwise it's all a part of me, rarer still, it's honestly a part of me I actually have nothing but acceptance of. And I'm alright with that.

It's like a screeching kettle letting off steam so I don't boil over entirely. From what I've read, dreams actually keep us sane. Even if we can't remember having any, we still dreamt to a certain degree. It's the brains strange way of working through it all and processing all of it.

Yep! Usually both my GP and prescriptions aren't a problem. I'm linked in with Centrelink and have a health care card :). My health care card usually covers any script and it usually only costs around $5.50 per prescription. However.

My current meds aren't covered by the PBS or my health care card though. Even the generic brand options are relatively expensive for me (about $40- $60 together) because the first prescription (melatonin/Circadin) isn't covered for anybody, I don't believe, and my second med (Seroquel/Quetiapine) is only covered if it's being prescribed for treating it's target illnesses of psychosis/bipolar/schizophrenia. I'm being prescribed the drug for my PTSD to treat anxiety and sleep and have to pay full price for it. I used to have a GP that would happily write the script up to be subsidised because of the expense. My current GP and Psychiatrist won't though, which is fair play.

My GP usually bulk bills me. The exception here is I need a referral to see my psychiatrist for the 3rd time in two months. He cancelled my last appointment because he doesn't see patients more than twice in two months. Unless I can pay for my appointment, I'll have to wait the two months. My psych doesn't normally bulk bill, either. But between my GP and my Psych (who work out of the same practice) they usually take great care of me regarding my circumstances."

This type of thinking is called 'catastrophising'. 'Cognitive Behavioral Therapy' is really helpful for people who have started to use unhealthy or maladaptive thinking patterns in life. 'Mindfulness' is also a great practice when we're on the negative thought cycle. 'Guided Meditation' is also a really valuable tool to have when you need to conquer the chaos in your mind.

If you like, I suggest you try looking up the terms I've written in quotes online via. Googling them or YouTube-ing them so you can learn some more.

These are not all quick fixes, but I've found them to be invaluable when it's come to my own mental health and wellness. Understanding it all means I have more coping skills and I can learn how to get better.

It was a really sucky thing to realise within myself. 

I'm not playing a grass is greener on the other side here either when I say this - but god I wish I could cry for a few hours. I can't do it anymore, I'm too numb, but I miss crying.

Thinking of you x 
Thank you for your reply."
depression_help,fhh0rxj,t3_f345k5,1581588322.0,"I'm glad you reached out and so glad you asked.

Firstly, thank you for being a wonderful human. I know it's not always easy to support people who, not unlike myself, suffer from severe depression and/or anxiety etc. I really hope to have a partner who cares as much for me as you do for your wife someday.

Your own self care is vital. It's extremely important to take care of yourself so you don't burn out.
I may not have all the answers but please remember not running yourself into the ground is a very important thing to be aware of and you are **never** being selfish by making time for yourself in all of this. Don't set yourself on fire to keep another person warm. Your wife needs you to be healthy and happy too. Both as a husband and father.

Men's mental health is also something that gets overlooked quite a bit, as in it is definitely not spoken of equally at present due to many factors, and this has terrible consequences for fathers and husbands and men in general going through crisis. Please keep reaching out.

If I totally misread this or assumed you are male - I'm really sorry, it wasn't intended. The heart of what I'm saying goes for anybody in your situation though.

- I really do suggest you speak to your own GP and ask for a referral to speak with your own therapist, too.

- Don't isolate yourself. Please talk to any family members or mates you have about how you're doing. It's unhealthy to carry the weight of the world by yourself and just talking can help a lot.

- Take time out. Find a friend and have a beer or a coffee or a walk together once or twice a week. Something that does not revolve around the problems at hand. Even try to make it something you'll look forward to.

- Remember a person has to actually want to get better. We can't force loved ones into recovery. It's a choice they have to truly make. They have to want it for themselves otherwise it's very very hard to support and facilitate healthy change. 

- If your wife keeps rejecting specialists, perhaps there's another underlying cause. Have they all been male? Does she need to speak with a female? Does she need a second opinion from another GP? Or a new diagnosis? Is she experiencing post partum depression? Is she simply too anxious and afraid to talk about what's going on for her? 

- You and your wife may benefit from having a list of mental health hotlines at hand. Telephone counseling services offer brief crisis intervention, are available 24/7, can provide a bit of insight without the pressure of an appointment or speaking to someone in real life face to face, and can offer referrals. You will usually have the choice to remain anonymous if you wish. 

- Just go to your local E.D. or a walk in mental health clinic. At this point I would suggest your local E.D. It doesn't have to be life or death situation or an 'emergency' so to speak, so don't be afraid to just walk in and tell them what's going on. The team of medical professionals know exactly how important and urgent mental health is and will treat you seriously. They're there to help. Ask for the equivalent in your country for a 'mental health review' by the consulting mental health team. Ask to speak to one of the hospital's resident Psychiatrists and to have your situation evaluated and followed up in the community if your wife is well enough to be an outpatient. Perhaps an admission to hospital will be made, but just take things as they come. If it sounds a little scary to either of you, it's one hundred percent understandable. It is all a little scary, but I promise you your mental health professionals are there to help, they want to help, they will be kind, and they know their stuff. 

I'm thinking of all of you x

Edit: A few 'by the way' thoughts that came to me.. they may be totally unhelpful and off the mark but you never know.

- Is she experiencing side effects from a particular medication?

- Is she on a particular contraceptive since the birth of your daughter? Is it affecting her hormones or creating a hormonal or chemical imbalance? 

- Has she had her bloods and general hormone levels checked regardless?

- I know I did mention it earlier but yes, post partum depression. If not, even being a first time parent can just exacerbate mental illness full stop. It's nobody's fault. Support is out there.

- Couples therapy and mediation, or family counseling may be beneficial if she's losing patience with you or you're both wearing out. If telling her how you feel or telling her anything in your own private time seems to be getting impossible or just goes nowhere, mediation in couples therapy can be a really valuable tool for working through it all. The therapist will 'keep you in check' so to speak and referee good communication so it stays exactly that - good communication. They'll help you both reflect and be heard properly and they'll do it tactfully with everyone's best interest in mind. If the idea seems a bit sterile or like it's something only couples who are viciously fighting or separating do - it's not all like that. It's not exclusively for couples who fight or are on the brink. It's for couples. You are a couple. And seeking out help to facilitate healthy change and conversation can be a really positive thing and everyone is entitled to seek help and to want to improve their relationships."

I know it feels that way. I'm currently back on my own ""treadmill"". It's just a feeling though. As cruel as it is, it's just a terrible feeling. You're not really running on a treadmill alone going nowhere. You're not alone, in fact you're one of many, in that you are running a marathon. The scenery will slowly change. You'll come by other people a little further down the road to recovery.

Nobody is running the depression, C-PTSD or PTSD marathon alone. We're all doing our best to out one foot in front of the other. Sometimes we can run free for a while enjoying the sunshine and fresh air. 

Some parts of the track we have to battle the elements or limp along while injured. There are dark holes and hairpin turns along the way and we won't always see them coming or clear them seamlessly or unscathed. 

We do clear them though. However long it takes. Others who have been where we are now can cheer us on and give us maps and rough guides for the territory. They may even sit with us looking and checking in when we fall into the darkness of rock bottom, keeping us company until we're strong enough to climb out. 

Wherever you're at, I promise you are getting somewhere. Even if you're taking baby steps or moving through distressing intense emotions at a glacial pace, keep on moving. It may take time but small rays of sunshine will start to find their way into your darkness again as you recover and the walls start coming down.

Even your most broken parts will heal. It'll be imperfect. It'll leave scars. But somehow, I promise you, it's all going to be more beautiful than before.

It's good to have a sense of humour, and laughter is definitely healing. But before I knew it, I'd been using humour, self depreciation, and being very flippant about things until it had become nothing more than a huge wall to keep people out.

Growing up, I didn't receive love and the love I had to give was not received. I found that I could be funny though and when I made people laugh I knew I was safe for two seconds and it felt like the closest thing to love. I also knew that if people were laughing with me it was because I *chose* to be funny. I was in control for a minute and it was humour. Not humiliation at my own expense.
