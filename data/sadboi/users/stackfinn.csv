autism,f6lsxgw,t1_f6kdbqu,1572959896.0,"Thank you for the information. 

As for the crying, she was just overwhelmed. She was just recently told, probably had heard of Autism but didn’t know anything more about it and what that meant for her child, and like the comment below, is probably feels like a failure of a parent since her child is a teenager and they are just finding out. She did say she was really frustrated with the lack of resources for older children with Autism. Anything she had found so far was for young children or adults. 
She also said she is easy to cry. It is likely her go to response when she is overstimulated."

therapy,f6iqctw,t3_drdw0l,1572882703.0,"I was in a very similar boat to you. I had tried a few therapist in college with no luck and a few years after college, I tired again, saw two different therapists that didn’t help. To the point of self-admitting myself to a crisis center. Now I have a wonderful therapist where I’m not worried about how much truth I tell her. 
If you feel uncomfortable with this therapist for any reason, that is reason enough to find a new one. Keep looking, you will find the right fit for you!
If you ever need someone to talk to in the meantime, let me know."

Frontend,f5mn9x0,t3_dnkys4,1572291721.0,"My point was, someone without a college degree can get replaced more easily than someone with a degree. Just because you don’t need a degree now for a job, doesn’t mean you won’t need one later. 

Also you are assuming that the college student and 25+year employee are equal in their knowledge. Which may or may not be the case depending on the situation, field and company. 
Maybe it’s because I’m cynical of big companies but I doubt the reasons for firing someone that has been at the same company for 25 years, is due to something they are doing wrong. It seems like a money saving move to me. Which I guess is business but doesn’t make it right either. But I guess it could be that an older employee can’t/won’t learn newer technologies that a recent grad would already know or something similar."
Frontend,f5mhy8z,t1_f5fodhh,1572290099.0,"I know of multiple people where they have been in a field or even a particular company for over 25+ years and they will get pushed out for not having a degree. It isn’t because they don’t know how to do the job, it is so they can go pay some young kid out of college a lot less money. At least that is my POV from the stories I’ve heard. I’m sure there are a lot of other reasons as well."

CPTSD,f3cs0qn,t1_f3cmdz4,1570827545.0,I got the gravity blanket on sale and it has been my favorite buy of the year! It helps me fall asleep faster and I don’t wake up as often in the middle of the night anymore.
migraine,f1cz4j8,t3_d81r58,1569369622.0,"1. Talk to a doctor, explain to them your symptoms and ask them for a doctor’s note. 
2. Bring that note to your university’s disability office. They can make it that professors have to give you certain accommodation. For example, handing in an assignment a day late due to a migraine, taking an exam in a different setting or a little late. These accommodations depend on the school but also your professors. 
3. Talk to your professors early! (For this semester ASAP).
I found in my time in university that it helped a lot to tell the professors in the beginning of the semester what you struggle with. This way when it does happen, they understand it is an issue you warned them about and not just an excuse because you didn’t prioritize your studies. I’ve had professors who understood and gave me more accommodations than required of them but I have also had professors who just didn’t understand and would hardly give me the help I needed to succeed. Speaking to your professors after the first day of class (for upcoming semesters) will give you a good sense of how your professor is going to react and gives you time to switch classes if they are not understanding (trust your instincts on this!). Since you are already into this semester, I would set up office hours with them and explain this new development for you. Explain that you are going to do everything in your power to understand your triggers and to try to stay healthy so they don’t effect you as several but that they will happen and you want to give them a heads up. 
4. I know this is one going to be really hard while in  university but do yourself a favor and try to get a good sleep schedule going. Going to bed around the same time every night and getting up the same time every day is going to help you out a lot. (Sleep is a very common trigger for people with migraines.) 
5. Find some sort of mediation that works for you. This will help keep your stress levels lower (stress is another very common trigger and in university stress is normally an everyday thing). Yoga, meditation class, meditation apps, or even just giving yourself 5 minutes a day of sitting in a dark, quiet room will really help. This isn’t something you will notice right away but overtime it will compound and by the time finals roll around you will be able to handle your stress better and hopefully make it to all your exams. 
-I wish you the best of luck. Suffering from migraines in college is a hardship that your friends and professors will likely not understand. Take care of yourself first, it is more important for you than others because you have more at stake. Please message me if you have any questions."
migraine,f1cxgeh,t3_d7y4t3,1569368369.0,"I definitely get migraines from crying. Any sort of intense emotion will likely result in a migraine or at the very least, me having to take a nap because I’m so worn out."

PoleFitness,ex6rx7r,t3_crb6gz,1566050522.0,"If some of the other advice doesn’t get you to the point you want, maybe try a private lesson with an instructor you trust. Tell them your concerns and see if they can teach you in a different way that helps you get over them. Even if you don’t get it in that one private lesson, the teacher will remember this during future classes and will help you by providing more support. This should help you progress even if it is just a little. 

I do agree that some moves will just naturally be harder for some over others and it is perfectly fine to take longer to get them. Everyone struggles with a move they think everyone else can do but them. Whether it is an actual move, transition or even the left vs right side. Just keep practicing and your body will eventually have that ahh-ha moment and you will be able to do it!"
xxfitness,ex6oan4,t1_ex361m1,1566048863.0,"I’m a lifeguard and have done cpr on those dummies many times (thankfully I haven’t had to on a person). We have talked about this in our meetings that folks with breast will make our hand placement a little more difficult and how to be mindful of that. I’ve heard that they are in the process of making new dummies with breast to fix this issues. 
It is sad that there had to be a survival gap for this issue to be noticed. Like the OP said, the design of these things are created with the average male in mind. If someone had thought earlier on to keep in mind women and bigger folks who have breasts, we could saved more lives."

It took me a very long time to finally cut ties with my mother due to her emotionally abusive behavior. It seems like you are ready emotionally to cut ties with your family and with the help of your therapist I think you will be able to really continue your healing journey. I wish you the best of luck!"
