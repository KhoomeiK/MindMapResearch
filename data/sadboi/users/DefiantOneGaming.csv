I'm willing to bet the majority of these protesters are people who had jobs and lost them. That's a frustrating experience for anyone even if it was to protect others from Covid-19. 

There are countless people who are losing significant chunks of their life savings if not all of it trying to sustain themselves and their bills. 

I'm in Canada and there's a $2000 a month fund going around to compensate the people who aren't working but with so many people applying for it, it takes significant time to get approved and what if the $2000 a month doesn't cover all of someone's bills? Just fuck them right?

Covid-19 is a horrible, deadly illness that should be taken seriously. However, it isn't fair that many of these people who are not in fact dumb but rather feel disenfranchised because they no longer have any control over their lives or their incomes are constantly being shit on.

It's so easy to point a finger and say ""you're an idiot"" but nobody considers any other reasons why people might have a problem with everything shutting down other than them being stupid."
Idubbbz,fmn06eh,t3_fw95iu,1586215468.0,I mean Anisa complained he never supports or defends her but Chrisraygun does. Probably a combination of the two.

I think Idubbbz is only a part of who Ian is and maybe Ian is an insecure bitch on the DL. Who knows? Some of that leaked into his response for sure.

Idubbbz,fmkoytt,t3_fvpq75,1586162919.0,Anisa gives off a similar vibe to ProJared's wife who manipulated him and tried to ruin him. There's a ton of evidence that kinda points in the direction that she can manipulate and be super shady. I really hope that Ian doesn't get held hostage like Jared did. I was happy to find out that all of the allegations were proven false towards ProJared btw.
Idubbbz,fmkor5q,t3_fvriz6,1586162678.0,"I'd like to point out that the person Idubbbz is isn't who Ian is. Idubbbz is just a part of him. Apparently he's super introverted outside of doing YouTube videos so he might have some underlying self-esteem issues he covered up with his Idubbbz attitude and humor. I think his persona cracked a little bit and we got a blend of Idubbbz and another part of Ian. There are plenty of content creators who change at least somewhat when the camera goes off. 

We don't really know for sure but I'm willing to bet that's definitely part of it."
Idubbbz,fmkofxb,t3_fvus49,1586162329.0,I think it would be a hilarious home run from outta nowhere if he made a content cop on his own girlfriend. I don't hate her or anything but it would just be a sick plot twist.
Idubbbz,fmko2n4,t1_fmkn410,1586161923.0,"People who crave and need attention have major self image problems. She said herself that she didn't like her natural tits. Maybe she thought they were too small or didn't like the shape of them or something. 

What I'm saying is that Ian wouldn't normally cave to something like that imo but maybe I don't know him that well and he likes the idea. If Anisa knows that Ian will do whatever he can to keep her, which he said himself, she can keep throwing the ""I can't do this anymore"" card and try gaslighting him into believing he's a shitty person who can't do better than her. Someone who gets beaten down like this will start to believe it at some point if they don't leave. It's manipulation plain and simple. I'm throwing a ton of hypotheticals in here but if I'm right I can understand how it can happen to someone because it happened to me. 

She complained a bunch about how he never supports her or backs her up and that kinda gave me the impression that maybe Ian isn't so okay with it. Maybe she just gradually wore him down until he gave in and said ""fine, do whatever you want"" and resigned himself to it so she wouldn't leave him. 

I think the OnlyFans thing is also because she's an attention whore and there's plenty of evidence to back that up. This way she can make some $$$ while getting the attention she craves and she probably believes her fake tits would bring her more attention. The worst thing for an attention whore is having a partner who has more attention and affection given to them. They want the spotlight to be on them and it creates even more insecurities in that type of person when they're second fiddle to their SO. Being known as Idubbbz' girlfriend for three years would probably really bother her since that shows people don't care about her, just him. 

Like I said, it's all speculation but I'm sure something will come out sooner or later. I couldn't care less what either of them do, I just hope I'm wrong and Ian is fine."
Idubbbz,fmki0is,t3_fvrwd4,1586155619.0,"After seeing all the discord leaks and all that kind of stuff I think I'm actually concerned for Ian.

Anisa has definitely shown signs of having self image problems and needs that attention from seemingly every source she can get it to feel validated. 

The discord leaks reveal that she thinks he doesn't show her enough attention and doesn't put her first. She wants to be put on a pedestal by him but also wants the attention she gets from randoms too. 

She talked shit about him plenty and talked about leaving him to the point that he caved and said he didn't think he'd find someone else like her again and wanted to do whatever he could to work on it.

I think she gradually wore him down from this angle and he caved; buying her fake tits and supposedly being fine with her onlyfans.

He may very well be perfectly okay with the whole thing. It might be his kink, who knows? I couldn't really care less if that is the case.

I was in a relationship with a manipulative abuser who would pull some of the shit Anisa has pulled. I know it's not a direct comparison and it's anecdotal but she may have Ian so convinced that he needs her and he would never find someone else like her that he just resigns himself to be supportive of things that bother him deep down. 

His response video didn't give off a genuine vibe but maybe I'm just seeing things. His expression didn't match his tone and he just looked defeated to me.

I really hope that she doesn't treat him poorly but I just have a bad feeling from past experience. I may have her read completely wrong and I hope I'm wrong. At the end of the day I don't know either of them, their lives, or their relationship."
depression,fitlubt,t1_fitcrvw,1582723765.0,"I apologize I didn't get back to you sooner. I saw your comment but was in the middle of something.

You mentioned that I seemed intellectual and that I had issues with my identity being controlled by others. I want to tell you that both of those are true I suppose. When I was about six years old I was tested. The test results put me in the ""gifted"" bracket. I hate using that term to define myself because I don't think I am more intelligent than anybody else. What that testing did do; however, was lock me in a box. The familial expectations I mentioned were largely created as a response to those documents. It was a large reason why I was treated poorly in school as well. I have spent my entire life just wishing I was average thinking that I would've been accepted.

I also think that it plays a major role in my fear of failure as well. I'm not exaggerating when I say I was always surrounded by people who wanted me to fail. It sounds unreasonable to say that everyone wanted that but I grew in an incredibly small town. I saw the same faces in first grade as I did in twelfth. It was unfortunate for me that the first couple people to dislike me were the most popular people around. When I didn't understand why people didn't like me I asked my parents. They misled me in telling me that they didn't like me exclusively because I was a smarter and better kid than any of them were. I was only a young, naive child so I didn't understand what that really meant at its core. The first time I repeated those exact words from my parents I had sealed my fate. That's what really cemented this animosity towards me. That's why people wanted to see me fail. 

Everyone in the school hated me if I did well and my mother was emotionally abusive when I didn't outperform every other child. I went to and from hostile environments on a daily basis. 

I didn't mean to go so far in depth with my past so I'll move forward.

I spend far too much time in my head. I'm always envisioning catastrophe. I haven't tried investing my time thinking of contingency plans. Planning as far ahead as you do would alleviate so much stress though. It's definitely a better option than trying to shove those thoughts down until they pile up to the point that I just want to give up completely.

I'm still on my journey of self reflection. I've come to terms with things that were my own fault and trying to understand the things that weren't my fault rather than taking all of the blame upon myself for everything. I'll just try to learn and improve every day. 

Thank you again for taking the time to respond."
depression,fitbwff,t1_fitbc0g,1582713976.0,"I think it's a multifaceted problem honestly. It boils down to lack of motivation, fear of failure, fear of success, and self-deprecation. 

I'm so afraid of failing that when I try to better myself I decide to quit before I get fired in a sense. On the other flip of the coin, if i succeed, I'll have more uncertainty available to me than I had before which also frightens me. I only thought about that side of things recently. Dwelling in this dark, empty place treading water has become familiar territory.

I've been described by so many people in my lifetime. The vast majority was negative. I think I read someone that one negative statement is equivalent to 300 positive ones but don't quote me on that. When you have so many people telling you that you're a certain type of person, you begin to believe it. I began to believe that I was a horrible person, undeserving of love and success. When I say I was surrounded by people who were eagerly waiting for me to fail, I'm not exaggerating. 

I don't think I'm a good person. Part of me believes I've deserved every bad thing that has happened to me. I do; however, want to be better.

niceguys,fisomd3,t1_fisnus5,1582689301.0,"So if a guy sends an unsolicited dick pic like him; which I detest by the way, then he's fair game? A woman can feel any level of outrage and dish out any level of punishment she sees fit? 

People make poor decisions when fueled on any emotion. What if she decided to get him fired from his job? Or keyed his car? Or I don't know, tried to ruin his connection to his family by telling them all he's a disgusting pervert? 

There needs to be balance between what was done and the response. Otherwise those imbalances can lead to some pretty big consequences that shouldn't just be swept under the rug because ""who am I, as a man, to tell a woman how to feel about sexual harassment?"" 

I would've preferred she informed police of the action rather than his family if it was that much of a problem. Taking it into her own hands like that makes it look petty and equally gross.

Sending it to his family is a petty attempt to damage lifelong connections and make their interactions with family uncomfortable for the foreseeable future. 

Family will most likely forgive but those connections are far more ingrained than some random stranger on the internet.

I know full well nobody cares. Nobody has ever cared about me but you wouldn't know my walk of life or my family history so I can't expect you to know what I've dealt with just like I don't know your story. It's not a pissing contest to compare who has it worse.

The inference that I'm some child who needs mommy's help to not overspend just makes you come across like a douche to be honest.

I can and have ""adulted"" in the past and up until recently. I get downtrodden because of issues that vary from person to person and you give me the bootstraps crap. I normally agree with that when the environment isn't complicated by the fact that the person involved is self-loathing and has traded most emotion for numbness. 

I've pulled myself up. I've worked my fingers to the bone, where my life consisted of nothing more than eating and working because I don't sleep, even trying medications hasn't helped me.

Before you try and push this idea that my issues are solely because of a lack of maturity, ask yourself if you know anything about my experience up until this point. I'm not saying I'm the MOST responsible or the MOST dedicated or the MOST hard working, if that were true I wouldn't be in this mess.

I'm just an average guy who faltered. It happens to ""adults"" when they commit suicide, or throw their lives away to become an alcoholic or a drug abuser.

What happens when your workload suddenly decreases and now you have time to think about those things? You can try and block them out but unless I was worked to the point of severe exhaustion that feeling of emptiness and worthlessness would find its way in every time.

Your life may have been harder than mine, who knows, everyone has different walks in life and I've had advantages others haven't. That's not to say that how I feel inside has any right to be dismissed because of an outdated adage ""grow up"". Immaturity is not the cause of depression. If it was, ""established adults"" wouldn't be committing suicide suddenly when nobody expects it. They wouldn't have mental breakdowns and throw away their families, their homes, etc. to turn to alcoholism and drug abuse. That shit happens to people who have been self-made their whole lives.

rant,f6q2r86,t1_f6q1d66,1573069750.0,"You can go right ahead and sit on that moral high ground. The rainbow coloured poppy is unnecessary. It's just another way to say ""oh but us too, we deserve special acknowledgement"" when the red poppy does in fact cover everyone and everything. I said earlier I made an argument for the purple and black poppies since they were already being used but generally I would be good with the red poppy being the only representative; something you said yourself was a valid counterargument.

I don't doubt that the sincerity is there for lgbt soldiers but I think there's more to it than that.

I think the reason things like this happen is twofold. I think it's partially for attention and it's also put in place so people can do what you're trying to do. You're trying to make me out to be morally reprehensible because I have a criticism of the lgbt community which has substantial evidence to back it up. That way you get to feel like a good person when the reality is you haven't done anything other than virtue signal and pat yourself on the back. I'm not interested in trying to score morality points with you.

I just don't think sexuality should be a part of celebrating the bravery of the people who died."
rant,f6px97v,t1_f6pwsxc,1573066273.0,I mentioned above that my only gripe with the lgbt community is that they have a tendency to grab and latch onto attention sources. I didn't say it with those words exactly but I did say they like attention. It makes me wonder if what they're doing here is really about the soldiers who died or more because it garners attention for the lgbt community.
rant,f6pu6x1,t1_f6pr1xy,1573064354.0,"I don't know where the 211,000 came from. I doubt that the LGBT community was represented in direct proportion to the overall population. It could've been more and it could've been less, we don't know. Also 230 cases aren't much but you're right in the sense that tons of men probably kept quiet about it. I just know from what I've read that the British were pretty strict about these things and investigated upon suspicion. There may have been plenty of people who were lgbt and not found out and there may have been very few. We don't know, we dont have the statistics. 

I was making a case for the other colours sure. That said, I would be fine if red was the only colour. That would simplify and eliminate anybody being discriminated against since we all bleed red. But that isn't the case so I was arguing for what's already in place and I could see some merit there."
rant,f6plr2b,t1_f6phb2v,1573059138.0,"This is going to make me sound like an insensitive prick but the LGBTQ+ community isn't highly represented in any commonwealth military in today's society, where the community is more universally accepted. I live in Canada and unfortunately I can't get exact statistics on the military but only 1.7% of people identified as homosexual and 1.3% identified as bisexual in 2014 nationwide. The Canadian armed forces is constituted of roughly 95,000 soldiers. That's 0.25% of the Canadian population. Very, very few people amongst that group are in the LGBTQ+ community I'd imagine given the statistics. Back then, when it was highly frowned upon and even punishable people lived fake lives which was sad but even then I doubt many people were gay or bisexual despite all of those things. 

I just can't help but feel like this is just another effort to grab attention for the LGBTQ+ community. Meanwhile over 350,000 black soldiers fought in WW1 and over 16,000,000 animals were used in WW1. There were 6,000,000 (700,000 killed) British soldiers mobilized in WW1 and during that time there were 230 cases where soldiers received corporal punishment or were imprisoned for homosexual acts. That's definitely reprehensible as far as I'm concerned but those were the times. Even still, 230 out of 6,000,000 is a negligible number. 

I just can't help but think that this is just another opportunity for the LGBTQ+ community to grab attention. That sounds bigoted but it's true that the community likes to be front and center.

I don't really buy that 100% of the left's interaction with her is strictly focused on climate change. She's a pawn that ropes in younger voters with minimal risk of backlash because adults criticizing a kid looks bad. It's a petty shame tactic. It opens the door for people to shit on anyone that disagrees with her for: a) being an asshole for arguing with a kid and b) being more ignorant and uneducated than this 16 year old kid.

Filling in the blanks like a madlib isn't objective.

It's just a little bit much to me. It's like there can't be any other reason aside from a bigoted one for him to make statements like that. Statistics definitely wouldn't play a role in his opinion, god no.

You're the one filling the gaps. Lots of people like to fill gaps. You're the one assuming that he thinks it's like that because of a certain group of people.

Saying there's a crime problem doesn't automatically mean that he's solely blaming black people. But assuming his intentions are always based on racism makes me think that you worry far more about race than you should. Plenty of liberals and progressives appear that way. Not all but a healthy number of them. 

There are statistics to back the obscene crime rates in these places. If Obama brought it up, or anyone on the left for that matter, no racism would be assumed. It's so hypocritical. 

I'm not even gonna get into the Mexico issue. That shit has been bouncing around for years. It's a super complex issue that's multifaceted.

We could argue over intentions all day. I need some form of explicit proof before I place defamatory labels on people.

There are some massive assumptions being made here. 

There are countries who are worse off and he acknowledged that in a rude way. Is it worth twisting your panties up? No, not really. 

You assume that white people can't experience systemic racism. Bold assumption. Irish people were once indentured servants, not many differences from the slaves. Jews were also seen as a lesser class in some places. It's a sad reality where anyone is considered lesser. 

He doesn't claim a predominately white country to be a shithole not because they are predominantly white but because the majority of them have decent economies. But you really want to cram that square shaped block into the circle shaped hole and scream racist. 

He chose those women in particular for a reason. Maybe it was race. Maybe it was because they're some of the loudest in the party and great at sewing discord not just with the Republicans but with their own party. Pelosi and AOC were on bad terms for a while until he forced them to co-operate with this. Now he can tar all of them with the same brush to rally his base and turn swing voters away from the big bad socialists. He's playing the political game. 

It looks awful, it's tactless, some can even call it bigoted but there's a whole lot of gun jumping and name calling going on.

If your first instinct is to jump to the race card whenever Trump states something inflammatory rather than to think about any other reasons he would say that, then he's not the only one who has a problem with race.
