I've had a lot of different coping mechanisms, one was accepting my worst fears, and just playing through them in my head... not sure if this is good, but it helped me. I imagined living homeless and a complete ""failure"", and rather than panic just sort of existed in it.

I would deal with it in a lot of alcohol/drug abuse which led me to AA and sobriety. A big part of that is surrendering control. So I guess God really helped me, but that's a tough one to come around to if you are secular. PM me if you ever need someone to talk to. Noone deserves what you're going through"
