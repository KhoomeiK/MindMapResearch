I cannot even begin to understand your perspective or way of life, and I think that’s one of the biggest issues that happens in conversations like these. To someone who has experienced poverty or even just struggled to get by, the idea of owning a million dollar home is just unfathomable.

I found the way she was talking to be VERY similar to the “I’m not like other girls” feelings that I have. “I’m not like all those slutty blonde sorority girls, I actually have a brain and think for myself”. I’ve been trying really hard to combat those feelings in myself lately. 

I think teen girls go through that “I’m not like other girls” phase in a dawning realization of internalized, cultural misogyny. Cis women judge and tear each other down because of this misogyny as well. What struck me the most about what my girlfriend told me about is that it was near identical to the way that cis women talk about each other. 

Needless to say, this video hit both of us hard.

If you wind up at a prestigious college that you're completely miserable at, you're probably not going to do very well in your classes. You probably won't be inclined to network or become involved in things outside of the classroom if you hate the school, and both of those things can be very important.

badwomensanatomy,fq6w68m,t1_fq6pt2l,1589138619.0,"Numbing is a bit different. I think that’s primarily related to decreased blood flow that occurs when you’re cold, leading to a reduction in the sensory signals being transmitted to your brain. Habituation is a process of how your body handles the signals your sensory organs pick up. A good example of this is something called the cocktail party effect. Imagine you’re at a noisy party, engaged in conversation with someone. All the sudden you hear your name spoken across the room. You brain is constantly filtering through all the auditory information in the room, but you’re able to pay attention to the person you’re talking to because your brain is filtering out the other information before it reaches your conscious awareness. But when someone says your name, your brain goes “oh that’s me!” and your attention is pulled away from the conversation you’re having because your brain brings that sensory information to your conscious awareness. Does that explanation make sense?"

college,fpp1tlj,t3_gel6nh,1588794480.0,It’s okay if it takes more than four years to complete your degree. You’re not a failure or stupid if it takes you a little longer.
jmu,fpp1j35,t1_fpohg1l,1588794335.0,A lot of people aren’t coming back for graduation. Half the people I’ve talked to have no interest in it.
jmu,fpp1ggj,t3_gelvb1,1588794299.0,"Sucks, but also the heat in August is going to be oppressive. I was worried about the safety of having everyone in gowns in Virginia summer."
iphone,fpo5lvc,t1_fple18m,1588778781.0,"This has been helpful to hear. I've been leaning pretty strongly towards buying the new SE but I keep wondering if the 11 is worth it. I really hate the whole face ID thing and love the touch ID on my 6, that's the biggest selling point on the SE for me."
AcademicPsychology,fpnqxfq,t3_gegi5q,1588770625.0,I don’t know much about this but I do know that there is special licensing you need to have in order to work with illegal drugs. It’s worth exploring whether any of the professors in your graduate program have done that kind of work before or have the license.
lactoseintolerant,fpmhgys,t3_ge7oop,1588733171.0,I’ve found that gelusil tablets can help with the bloating and gas. Peppermint tea can help. Best way to deal with it is to prevent it in the first place by taking lactaid with your meals.
apprenticewitches,fpmdksl,t1_fpmdgn8,1588730747.0,I DM'd you. I think this is probably something you can escalate beyond HR
apprenticewitches,fpmcnv7,t1_fpmasq2,1588730194.0,"That's absolutely disgusting. I'm angry on her behalf. Make sure she documents it all, is there a higher up like HR she's able to contact? I'd recommend sending that to a higher up immediately.
edit: I see now you said HR is being useless. Send it to HR anyways. Honestly if it were me I would just notify them every time something happens. Be annoying as fuck until they take it seriously. Same with the police."
apprenticewitches,fpl0q7s,t1_fpl04yn,1588704335.0,"I know your girlfriend is probably going through a really hard time right now, and I really empathize with that. I completely empathize with wanting to kick some ass, god knows if someone did something like that to my GF I would be livid. But I just don't want you or her to wind up in more trouble than you started with. Everyone on this thread has made some really good suggestions for alternatives."
