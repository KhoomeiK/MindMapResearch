But honestly we are all in this together. Eventually BPD will be the same as any other DSM diagnosis; thanks to bastards like us pushing through ðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ"

BPD,etnbvwc,t3_ccc05t,1562982576.0,"Incredible news!! 

I think it is appropriate for you to mention your suspected diagnosis; also explaining the symptoms and how they are effecting your life. Then I suggest letting the therapist come to their own conclusion (after a few sessions or more) and honouring that. 

You are working collaboratively with a professional to support your healing and development - making it valid for you to share what you are thinking (showing your own introspection and interest in gaining knowledge and help). 

As for what recovery is like, you can look up 'recovery reality' - that image sums it up. It will be intense, but so is your life right now. It will be productive intense and you will feel ease again. 

Be sure to love yourself, be compassionate and reach out to others. You are a good person as you are, you just need to learn some skills. 

Congratulations again!"

BPD,erfokg0,t3_c1m4nu,1560813701.0,"It can be really challanging - I find I need to use radical acceptance if I have a gut feeling I am being (cue the trigger) 'unreasonable'. 

I have to agree with many of the others; I think it helps me protect myself from vortexes. Some relationships are toxic for me. I have quiet BPD, so I people please and give-give-give. This is fine when I am with likeminded people who respect my boundaries. Shit when surrounded by takers. 

Now I give (not give-give-give) to those who respect me, and try to mindfully shed the shit I endure in challanging relationships. Best to be passive when being shit on - people always reveal their ugly sides (all by themselves). 

Nothing is black and white - not even splitting. Sometimes it is good to throw up your walls. Just make sure you take care of the you that learnt how to throw up those walls. You were probably hurt this way before and that's what's reacting. 

Keep on keepin' on everyone. And remember, we didn't ask for this."
