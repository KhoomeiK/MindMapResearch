mentalhealth,fqk54t2,t1_fqjod66,1589420341.0,"Right.  I'm glad you asked.  It's a lot easier to describe the behaviors than it is the emotions.  Describing the way a psychotic episode feels is about as easy as describing a color or taste or sound.

Imagine a hive of bees in your mind.  Bees on methamphetamine - and they're as loud as a freight train on an open track.  Each bee in the hive carries a terrifying thought.  Your brother is a secret agent for the CIA.  Your upstairs neighbor is a hitman for the mob.  People wearing red shirts can usher you to safety.  Blue cars will break traffic laws to run you down in the street.  Any thought can make your palms sweat and your breathing shallow.  

Imagine knowing that you are freaking out but everytime you reach for the off switch it dissolves in your grasp like a dream that escapes you moments after you wake up.

You know you are being tormented but you don't realize it's affecting your behavior.  All the things I mentioned before (knocking on doors in the middle of the night, approaching strangers etc.) seem rational, planned, normal.

The terror comes in waves.  Moments of lucidity dissolve into the mix.  You put on a kettle for tea and sit down on the couch.  You disassociate and you get lost in the bees and the smoke alarm snaps you out of it twenty minutes after you sat down.

You don't sleep, the bees make it impossible.  The furious speed at which they flood your psyche the amplitude of the sound - it all drives you to irrational action while a stillness dances alongside keeping you unaware of just how dangerous your life is becoming."
bipolar,fqiylan,t3_gj3m1t,1589402646.0,"Well first of all it should be clear that in the U.S. there is no ""partial"" option.  The state  decides you are either unfit for work or you are able to participate in substantial gainful activity.  I think at one time things may have been different but these days you're on the rolls or your not.

This doesn't mean you can't work while you are collecting an SSDI check but from the governments perspective you will be classified as disabled once you convince the Social Security Administration that your mental health condition makes it impossible for you to hold down a job.  Key word there is impossible.

The process for getting on the dole can be long and daunting and it can fuck with your well being.  Few people \*want\* to be on disability and the state does a really good job keeping it that way.  I've been in process for 18 months and have been told I can expect to wait another 8-10 months before I get a judgement.  The allowance I will receive will put me in poverty.  If I knew that working wouldn't trigger a potentially lethal episode I would much rather work.

I don't want to talk you out of it but I firmly believe -having pursued SSDI myself- that working is a better option.

As for telling your partner... it's hard to say where to begin as we don't know much about the dynamics of your relationship.  Ideally your SO would have some understanding and sympathy of/for your condition.  They would know the ways in which you are limited by illness and they would want you to be as strong as healthy as possible, even if that meant not working.  Assuming they are pragmatic you might start by doing your research.  Find out what your entitlement would be at [www.ssa.gov](https://www.ssa.gov).  Look into how much money you would be able to make while still collecting a check and look into the average processing times for your district.  Create a plan for supporting yourself while you wait (remember your trying to convince a judge that you are unable to work so working while waiting doesn't look so good). Then you can present your case to your SO with confidence in steps forward.

Good luck.  You've got this."

A dulling of sensation (sexual and otherwise) is an unfortunate challenge that is familiar in this subreddit and in some regard there may be no cure to this particular malady but there may be some options.

If you're a guy I'd suggest sildenafil.  Yes, it sucks to be a younger person taking boner drugs.  And yes, your partner needs to have a certain amount of compassion and patience that isn't always easy to find in a mate. But, that shit will get you more than halfway where you need to be to please your partner.

If you're a lady the challenge is a bit steeper.  It may be a case where you have to decide whether or not this side effect is a deal breaker.  There are more than a handful of often prescribed meds that deliver similar effects as Lithium. 

Finally, as others have suggested there may be another drug in your quiver that is influencing this soft sexual response.  Antipsychotics are very often a culprit for low libido."

I'm still learning how to cope.

Two years ago my Dx was changed to Schizoaffective disorder-bipolar type.

During the first six years of life after my initial diagnosis I took my meds and lived a relatively stable, mostly fulfilling and very productive life.  I also supplemented my medicine with copious amounts of alcohol.  With time the meds and booze were working so well that my doctor changed my status to ""in remission"".  This turned out to be a bad move as I quickly became relaxed with treatment.  Psychotic behavior returned and I ended up in the hospital for a second and third time.

Coming to terms with the fact that I have a chronic life long condition is daunting.  I don't always think about it but at least once or twice a day I feel terrorized by my illness.

Medication is a must.  Therapy needs to be considered and tried.  Group support has been invaluable to me.  Other things I find that are helpful for managing my affliction are journaling, mood tracking, hiking and playing my music at top volume.

bipolar,fpmd8js,t3_ge008m,1588730542.0,I prefer to look at it as a situation where I get to step up to a challenge.  To commit to stability and recovery.  To be honest with my partner and accept their flaws while they accept mine. Yeah being in a relationship with someone who is bipolar can lead to some really volatile moments BUT I'm bipolar and I am worthy of love - and so is my partner who has every opportunity to fight back against the tyranny of the disorder.

Don't sweat the weird stuff comrade.  Find gratitude in the fact you have friends and remember SZA is not a personality disorder.  It's a  mood disorder with psychotic features.

If you're looking for a good challenge spend some time thinking about all the people you have met or read about or seen on a screen.  Then grab a pen and paper (or blank word document) and start writing a definition of normal.

Kidding, that's a fools errand. But you get my point right?  Weird is entirely subjective.

Personally I find it weird that my bipolar girlfriend  drinks Redbull.  Because, like, really your mood swings can't give you wings naturally? And she thinks it's weird that I use an electric toothbrush.

Hundreds of thousands would consider either of those things to be totally normal 

And as for the number of friends you have...

If you keep putting yourself out there you're bound to become close with many more weirdos along the way.

Stay the course.  You've got this."
BipolarReddit,fpczhta,t3_gcr6hz,1588516530.0,"The lithium film is thick.  After about six months of feeling exactly the way you describe I dosed down by 300mg and added Wellbutrin to my cocktail.  My serum levels are still in the therapeutic range and I still feel the film/fog but it's not quite as thick as it once was.  I guess you could say I've leaned into it.

Lithium is a heavy drug and it affects everyone differently but when it's working it does a fantastic job neutralizing mood swings.  It cuts the peaks off and fills in the valleys.  It also quiets suicidal ideation.

If you can't tell I'm a Li fanboy.  I mean what other drugs are on the periodic table?!?!

Sorry you're feeling off.  Like I said, I've been there but I decided to stick with it and at this point (18months later) I'm taking the benefits at +1 over the alternative."

schizoaffective,fpaisww,t3_gcbsxf,1588449049.0,"Invega (Paliperidone) can raise your prolactin levels (a hormone more prevalent in pregnant women).  In men, prolactin often reduces/removes one's sex drive.  You soldier just won't want to stand at attention after some time with the drug.  It can also cause you to grow breasts and start lactating which -unless that's your thing- is kind of icky to think about.

I was on it for 16 months and had a five year relationship end over problems in the bedroom.

ED is a frustrating condition.  Especially at a young age.  Sildenifil (Viagara) works with an understanding partner in a pinch -or- for a wank, but is a bit cumbersome to manage.

There's no perfect antipsychotic out there and some side effects are deal breakers, other's are tolerable.  It'll be up to you to decide.

And as far as vaping is concerned, there is truth to the fact that nicotine monkeys with the vascular system.  I'm currently struggling to quit vaping as well.  One day at a time.

Lithium tablets have proven to be effective treatment for people who are having pervasive suicidal ideation.  Also, a nursing home may not be the worst thing to happen to you.  It's a safe environment where you can get personalized care.  This disease is a cunt but it doesn't have to be fatal.

Glad you reached out here for support.

If meds alone are only getting you part way to where you want to be, lean into it a little. Try therapy (CBT, ECT, EMDR, DBT), group support, journaling, mood tracking, exercise, part time work or listening to music at high volume.

Oh, and before you go getting too pissed off at your prescribing doctor let it be known that not everyone gets good results with their first round of medicine.

I've been in recovery for 2 years since then and stable for 18 of those months.  So yeah, stability is possible.

You may also start using extreme caution around substance use.  Alcohol and recreational drugs (which I discovered at 18 y.o.) can provide exceptional relief from symptoms.  To date (having been on 8 different Rx's over the years) vodka, IPA, and the devils lettuce gave me some of the best results in treating symptoms.  They also had the worst side effects."

The key to stability is a consistent treatment plan.  And with a litany of medication side effects that's often easier said than achieved.

Along with medication and therapy (both non negotiables) things like group support, maintaining good sleep hygiene, journaling, exercise and app assisted mood tracking can be good tools to utilize during recovery.

Recovery is an on going process - not an event.  

Self care is a fundamental ingredient to success.
