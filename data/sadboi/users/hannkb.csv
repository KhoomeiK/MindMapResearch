mentalhealth,f1bhb8c,t3_d8m161,1569334566.0,"I went through a rough time about 5 years ago, where I ended up isolating myself - no study, no job, no friends, minimal contact with extended family. I only spoke to my immediate family, and not very much because I was on an almost reversed sleep schedule.

When I started getting better and getting back into interacting with other people, I remember feeling like I had lost my social skills. But it didn’t take me very long to feel normal again. Of course, I felt awkward, and still do often. I just try to remind myself that people are kind, it’s ok to be a little awkward sometimes, and people are more often than not worrying about themselves anyway and won’t notice if I “mess up” a little. 

Good luck with the volunteering!"

I always approach the puppy calmly because I don’t want to get him started. However, the owner really likes rough housing with him. Could this be getting him started? After playing with the owner he’ll then start nipping at me. He does nip at the owner a little bit, but always stops when told. When it comes to me the puppy doesn’t listen to me at all and even the owner struggles to get him to stop. 

Next time I see him I’ll try and see what I may be doing differently. And I will give what you said a go!"

I want to hurt myself but know I never will (again, it used to be a coping mechanism for me but hasn’t been for 3 years). It’s hard when your brain keeps telling you you want to die but you know that you can’t. 

I managed to get through, but the counselor could only give me 20 minutes before her shift ended. Have set up another appointment but it isn’t until Sunday. 

I just don’t want to feel this way anymore."

Your daughter seems to be very proactive and motivated, which is awesome! The comments may seem harsh to you but statements about form and posture are the least harmful and sometimes most helpful “criticisms”. If she’s taking the feedback in her stride I see no problem. Teachers and directors can be brutal sometimes. I feel like it’s better to be getting this feedback from someone she trusts and that loves her."
