Yeah that justifies killing a person, association.

I have a good relationship with the cops in my jurisdiction, they’re good people who are committed to serving the public even if it doesn’t always look badass, if they pull you over for a busted taillight they might help you fix it and let you go depending on the cop and if they know how to. This is what police departments should be, not just high school bullies with handguns, but a collection of people who serve the public, and do more than just enforce laws. And that starts with getting rid of fuckup thugs like these three.

Nobody on this sub will like this part, but I love how fire departments hold events like car washes or community garage sales in the engine bay. THAT is why people think higher of firefighters than the police. It’s one of the reasons I became a volunteer when I was just 14. If fire departments dropped this and just became directed solely at fire suppression/emergency management, with that being the only public contact, people would lose that buddy buddy relationship with fire companies.

Also, she was shot EIGHT times. I’ve fired guns in the past, and even between three armed thugs with semi auto service weapons, shooting someone eight times takes some fucking time, enough time to perhaps reflect as to whether this person you’re shooting is armed, if you’ve explored every alternative prior to gunning them down, or even if they’re the correct person to be shooting in the first place, which. they. weren’t. Over twenty bullets were fired by police (there were three officers), some going into neighboring buildings, which aside from being reckless, is also an endangerment off of the lives of non-combatants (technically everyone involved besides the police). The only reason for them to open fire to such a degree was the victims partner firing a shot at police, as they DIDNT announce their presence, and were mistaken for burgers, he was also arrested. 

They’re on administrative leave right now. Their names are Sergeant John Mattingly, Det. Myles Cosgrove, and Det. Brett Hankison. If you want to do anything about this you can call their “Public integrity unit”-(502) 574-2136. The mayors office number is (502) 574-2003. Their IA departments number is (502) 574-7144. 

This cannot be swept under the rug and they cannot be allowed to get away with this, they did faulty police work, endangered the lives of non combatants with collateral damage, and killed an innocent woman and arrested her partner for protecting them. Had any other group besides law enforcement done such a thing, it’s homicide. They are *not* immune to justice. When the police get away with killing innocent civilians and raiding a house they don’t have a warrant for, killing the wrong people in the process, the message it sends is fucking despicable."
