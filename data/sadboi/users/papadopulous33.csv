NoFap,f4zt7q8,t1_f4zsal1,1571915431.0,"You do know seasonal affective disorder is a real thing where you're mind stops producing enough serotonin,dopamine and too much melatonin in daylight where u feel tired, no energy and gain other mental problems because of the lacking chemicals? 

i cold shower since summer, eat all healthy food, vitamins, exercise, work. And still get affected by this.
i exercise even in the rain lol so the 'grey weather' isnt the point, the point is that people body get fucked up unbalanced chemicals.
