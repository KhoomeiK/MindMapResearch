depression,fe5g1yr,t3_enulbo,1578869017.0,"I guess nothing is so simple as that. Yes life is an inconvenience and terrible, but that doesn't mean the only conclusion to make is suicide. I 100% see the appeal, but (and I know it's hard to believe) but it's possible to feel differently about life. You would probably regret that choice if you were to survive. Seek help from anyone. Professional or otherwise, but if people spend days looking at product reviews, we can spend time to hear from loved ones and professionals on whether we should continue life. you are loved"
depression,fe5f2qi,t1_fe5em3g,1578868691.0,i don't pity but I can relate. you are loved and keep going. don't life win. you have the power to decide what you do or dont do

depression,fe5bupe,t3_enuf1f,1578867429.0,Is there anyone in your life who you can talk to?
depression,fe5aewp,t3_enib6u,1578867008.0,You are loved and appreciated. More than anything you have value! It takes a special person to accomplish what you have and it's okay to brag a little. If you have gotten this far imagine how much you could do in the future!

depression,fe57aoz,t3_enrr8r,1578866272.0,"I somewhat get that. What I think, is in our mind, we think that a gf or bf is the answer, but it's really something else. You don't want to add to your anxieties by getting into something like that. At least that's my opinion. It's your life and your choice, and I KNOW you're gonna hate to hear it, but your mental health should cone first before you start prioritizing others'"

depression,fe54tfm,t3_ens82q,1578865666.0,"I'm no professional, but if this is making you unhappy and you aren't enjoying life, then you don't need mine or anyone else's opinions. That should be enough to convince you there is a problem. If so, reach out to loved ones or to a professional. Goodluck"

depression,fe519nw,t3_enn3hy,1578864727.0,"I love you. Your family loves you. Please, don't. Don't take an easy way out. Don't accept the way you feel. I know fighting al the time is hard. I know it's a battle within yourself, but there is family, therapy, medication. Anything. The world meeds to see what you will do in life. I want to see what your potential is. Let me know if you are okay because your life matters to me."

Stutter,fe4yjws,t3_enkr13,1578864022.0,"Stuttering is hard, so is depression. It's all hard. But, I am 100% confident that you are worth praising. But you need to be confident too. Speaking seems like such a simple thing, but we know it's not, but that doesn't mean you don't get to communicate. You are loved and good luck"
depression,fe4vyfo,t3_enpbid,1578863302.0,"You are cut out for life! If anything, you are a gift to life. Your compassion may be difficult to wield, but you have the power to bring kindness and happiness into the world. You are struggling now, but that doesn't mean give up or change who you are. Reach out or find professional help. Whatever you think you need, but don't think you are below anyone else because you don't believe in contempt for others."
depression,fe4tg5k,t3_enrs4c,1578862648.0,"I do the same thing, and we both need to stop. Our feelings are valid. If that's how you feel, you have to be confident in it and not care how others will interpret them. If you are struggling, YOU ARE STRUGGLING."
