Wondering if anything stands out and what I can do to succeed financially. Also struggling with love and depression."

morbidquestions,fg71br6,t1_fg6m6q1,1580581675.0,Thank you. I don't know much about these things but from what I understand psychopathy is more biological than social. A part of what I was wondering is if there is a way to perhaps mimic that by physically changing parts of the brain.

SuicideWatch,fek270a,t1_fejhtls,1579191027.0,Like how tf are they so sure that it’s just a permanent problem?? Yall dont even know me lol
SuicideWatch,feigr3a,t1_feib6f5,1579138155.0,"I honestly don't know. I can't see myself being happy with anything. I can be making six figures and still want to die. Being with my ex was the closest thing to living a life worth living for me but even then I still felt like killing myself. I don't really fall for people so if anyone's going to make a romance-related suggestion it's not going to happen, I'm sorry for sounding so stubborn but I've decided to stay single for the rest of my life, romance is overrated and it's just not worth it for me. 

I feel like a lot of things would have to change from the start for that to happen."
SuicideWatch,fei3zp9,t3_ep9vhw,1579129777.0,"to the user who deleted their comment: I don't expect things to be sunshine and rainbows all the time, but its really just not worth it anymore for me. I don't really get the difference between those two things, its just a way to rephrase things for me. How can you have the motivation to live if you're not living to be happy? How can you when you're not looking forward to that possibility of you being happy again? Why do you hang on to your life when you don't find any joy in it? How can you find joy in being alive when you have nothing left? I'm sorry this is just how i see it."
SuicideWatch,fei255j,t3_ep6c47,1579128623.0,I feel the same way about old friends. People drift apart so fast.

BreakUps,fefpjbj,t1_fefkwwi,1579061594.0,Don't know why I've shared that but it makes me feel better when I talk to someone. If you want someone to talk to I'm always here btw.
BreakUps,fefpgjx,t1_fefkwwi,1579061539.0,"I hope things will get better for you. I'm planning to give my life one last push, if that makes sense. Try as hard as I can to live a somewhat fulfilling or successful life on my own, then make the exit knowing that I've pretty much experienced most of the ""wonders"" life has to offer. Plus I want to help my parents out first, become financially stable, stuff like that. I've lost basically every single reason to stay and remain here in this world till old age. Never wanted to stay from the start but my ex sort of held me back from actually committing to it."

SuicideWatch,fcmbs03,t3_ehsio5,1577769830.0,I used to but I don't think I can wait till then. Since finance is the biggest issue right now I'll make sure to take care of that for them before I die. I also don't wanna see them die. Yeah call me selfish I don't care. There's really no point for me to be here any longer past 45-50. Never asked to be born.

SuicideWatch,fbx751r,t3_eewe30,1577172315.0,"That's exactly how I feel with my ex bf sometimes. He tells me that none of it is my fault but idk I can't help but feel like I fucked up. I think I did. I didn't think about settling down getting married and having kids before I met him and I know it sounds dramatic considering how he's only my first ""real"" relationship but I love him so much. I think I fucked it up idk. Wish I could just end it all honestly but I have people to take care of. Planning to die in my 40s. And to be honest I don't believe in ""the one"" , I believe in making things work, if that makes sense.  When people tell me that I'm going to find ""somebody better"" it just upsets me because 1. I'm like borderline aromantic or something, I don't know, it's just really difficult for me to fall for people 2. I'm not going to disregard what we've had like that. 3. A part of me does not believe in the concept of romance, I think that it's just a mix of infatuation, lust, and friendship. People rely way too much on ""romantic feelings"" and I honestly think that it's just bs. That's infatuation and it doesn't last."
SuicideWatch,fbcut1b,t3_eckkjl,1576734583.0,That's what I was thinking too. I want to look good and be rich by the time I leave. Make the most out of my life till then

SuicideWatch,fb6rfp6,t1_fb6pd3d,1576557949.0,I feel like breakups arent supposed to make me feel this suicidal and it's probably not the breakup haha maybe just a part of it
SuicideWatch,fb6rcrv,t1_fb6pd3d,1576557877.0,"I know right!! It's not like I want to be sad and emo all the time :( Its worse when you know that they don't want to hear any more of it and is just saying stuff to get you to shut up about it. Or when they tell you that everyone goes through shit in life and suicide is selfish which implies that your pain/thoughts are invalid and you're just being whiny. The whole selfish talk actually fucks me over the most because I have really low self-worth and I absolutely hate myself and it just reminds me of what adults told me when I was younger (they still do actually) 

I recently went through a break up and my ex was basically one of my best friends and that made the suicidal thoughts worse. I was okay for a while, I actually had plans (it's kind of stupid if you think about it, it was just my first serious relationship and I expected it to last, like okay it's kinda my fault lol) to carry on living and stuff like that. I felt like for the first time in my life I actually made someone happy. And those were probably the happiest times of my life. We had our problems but I feel like our bond was strong enough to overcome anything. And we were close too so we could always talk it out. Never had such strong feelings for someone else before, maybe I'm borderline aromantic, I don't know, I know when someones good looking and I have my little crushes (purely sexual attraction) but I don't feel the need to chase after them. My family is also pretty unlucky when it comes to relationships, it feels almost cyclical sometimes how things play out, like this one thing from the previous generation just gets replicated in the next, it's almost like fate and sometimes I think that I am here to break the cycle. We broke up because his feelings for me became platonic, and he says that it's not fair if he keeps dating me. But I never really understood the concept of romance anyway, isn't it just a mix of infatuation, lust, and friendship? I really don't mind asymmetry in relationships, I think it's unrealistic to not expect infatuation to disappear at some point you know what I mean? But I guess it was too much for the relationship to happen. Never saw it coming, haha, I thought everything was completely fine. It doesn't help that everyone is all about finding ""the one"" and ""someone better"", I don't need that ""someone better"", it makes sense if the relationship was abusive or something but I don't like to disregard my past relationships like that because they're all meaningful to me and I still care about those people. idk, romance is overrated for me and I hate it when people try to force it down my throat. Sorry for the rant and the long paragraph, I'm just a little frustrated."
SuicideWatch,fb6q6tf,t1_fb6pkvt,1576556853.0,Thank you :'))
SuicideWatch,fb6oxd0,t1_fb6objn,1576555802.0,">Aw thank you :') Just thinking about the future, my ex, my life in general, that sort of thing. I get all fixated and sad when I do haha.

Doesn't help that I'm also pretty much alone and isolated rn. None of my friends are on campus for break and even if I talk to them about this sort of the stuff they just give me some shallow generic advice and tell me to suck it up. So yeah I guess I just feel really lonely right now."

SuicideWatch,fb2ns16,t3_eayu7v,1576454404.0,Same here. When I was 13 I thought I would finally muster up the courage to die in my 20s. Now that I'm 20 I'm planning to die in my 40s because I have people to take care of.
SuicideWatch,fb2lbhu,t1_fazf9fa,1576453131.0,"Thank you for replying! The thing is it's always been so hard for me to fall for people to the point where I thought that I was idk borderline asexual, something like that. It's not like I can't acknowledge someone's attractiveness but it does almost nothing for me, people are kinda like statues in my eyes, they may be beautiful but I don't feel the need to chase after them. Never had a lot of hope for things like love and romance, I feel like I wasn't made for it and maybe I should just accept that fact and move on but I always feel lonely, like super lonely. I don't have a lot of friends and I recently cut ties with the closest ones a few months ago, idk people change ig and they were being super nasty. The ones I have rn are good people but they all have their own stuff to worry ab, they don't really understand and give me these really shallow advice and I can tell that they don't want to hear any more of my bullshit and it kinda makes things worse. I've always felt unlovable and my mom could have aborted me but she chose not to in the end. My whole family is filled with bad decisions and unsuccessful/unhealthy relationships so I don't really know what a good loving one is like. Nobody in my family found their ""true love"" or whatever, they all just decided to settle and move on and nobody actually loves each other. It's kind of sad to think about but sometimes I think that maybe I was born to break the cycle, like be single and alone and just end everything. All the things that happened in the past just seems to get replicated in the next generation, like it's this never ending cycle that keeps happening no matter what age you're in. I hope some of that made sense, I'm not a good writer and I tend to blabber a lot."
