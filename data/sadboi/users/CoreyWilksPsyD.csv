mentalhealth,fmtzsdk,t3_fx2qdr,1586381941.0,"A lot of people are struggling right now. Most of my therapy clients are struggling with more stress, depression, etc. We've been working on ways to stay connected with loved ones and developing healthy coping skills. 

I wrote an article on Medium about ways people can cope with the stress of social isolation during quarantine. If anyone wants to read it, let me know and I'll link it. Otherwise, I know it's frowned upon to link to random stuff. 

I'm also down to answer questions people have about coping or other mental health-related topics."
