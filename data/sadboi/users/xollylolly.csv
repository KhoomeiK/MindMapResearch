bdsm,flfwgit,t3_foj7l1,1585120501.0,I‚Äôd let you dominate me.
BDSMAdvice,fkfghsb,t1_fkffyvv,1584133877.0,Seems like you did everything like you should. The only thing to do now is wait. Just dont overthink about it!
BDSMAdvice,fkffhp6,t1_fkff2p0,1584133245.0,"I see.
 Maybe it was also anything else that is revealed only when you see person for the first time. Could be also what you‚Äôve mentioned. 
Did you send her a text after the date? Maybe she is waiting for your approval and as you were both being so nervous: maybe she feels you didnt like her? Those are also just my guesses now because i dont know the whole story."
BDSMAdvice,fkfeebu,t3_fi20tk,1584132571.0,"Hello, also female sub here.

You mentioned that you voice chatted (not video chatted) and as i see it maybe the most simple answer to this is that she might not feel physical attraction here? 
I dont want to tell you that you are ugly, hope you dont see that comment this way, but you know there goes a saying ‚Äúbeauty is in the eye of the beholder‚Äù . And if you didnt exchange photos before it might happen that she imagined you differently and she got ashamed to tell you that. 

I am sure you did NOTHING WRONG.you was just being you and stay like that! 

I was also once(more than once actually) ashamed of telling someone that i dont find them attractive (you can imagine that is even more awkward for me having to tell that). Ghosting is the worst thing to do in this case, but it‚Äôs something people do when they‚Äôre afraid or ashamed to face the other person.

Please just dont blame yourself! I guess you just dont click and thats ok too. Not everybody is for anyone."

BDSMAdvice,fjgeoit,t3_fd9akv,1583324220.0,"Instead of telling you what i‚Äôd like to get for award i recommend you this (it will get you personalized ideas):

 When with my previous he made me write in a book- on one side of the book stuff related with bdsm and on the other normal ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù stuff.
On the left papers i had to write things i dont like and on the right things that i like.
It was good homework for me to discover myself but also for him to get ideas and know more about me.

For example: on the vanilla side i also had written that i like seafood and he once made me mussels!"
BDSMAdvice,fj0lvwm,t3_fasv83,1582902927.0,"As some mentioned before you are new to this. I can also say from my experience that i‚Äôve been afraid of some kinks but at some point i started to like them. I am not telling you that you will ever like those kinks in the future (maybe you will, maybe never), but it is a fact that going so extreme can be scary if you dont have any previous experience. 
My only advice is that you dont rush into things and dont push yourself because you want to make him happy. Just let yourself and rather train yourself on the things you like (once you‚Äôre comfortable 100% with those you usually even want to try something else. At least thats what happened with me)."
PanicAttack,fiwcues,t3_f9dbge,1582781488.0,"What helps for me is that someone hugs me and breaths with me (but of course someone im close and comfortable enough to do this). And also i dont want a lot of people around. So if you see that smth is happening i dont want everybody to freak down and start asking me what‚Äôs wrong, but if just one person notices and goes with me somewhere alone this way it‚Äôs better."
Anxiety,fhwri6y,t3_f4r0fp,1581926725.0,Wish you good luck on the date!just enjoy. You can do it üí™üèΩ
BDSMAdvice,fgi0ref,t1_fghutsm,1580800400.0,Thank you for those kind words. <3 I will focus on me now and see how it goes.
BDSMAdvice,fggzg54,t1_fggxxgm,1580773069.0,"I like your idea on turning the rule to selfcare. Thank you, I will definitely use that."
BDSMAdvice,fggz3sx,t1_fggwxf8,1580772838.0,"I am surprised I didn‚Äôt talk to him about that option right away. I guess I was so shocked at first that I agreed and just nodded my head on everything he said. I will try to reach him first thing tomorrow, since my emotional situation right now could only make things worse."
BDSMcommunity,ff4a140,t3_er6pyg,1579558805.0,"Yes but only for play ( at least for now). He also helped me choose stockings or high-heels while i was shopping, so it goes even more specific sometimes, but as i said not for casual dressing but for play."
Anxiety,ez4ivmy,t1_ez1bidd,1567687530.0,"Wow, this is like reading my own story. Except that for me I actually got Diagnosed for GERD first and since nothing changed we eventually figured out that it‚Äôs anxiety. Went through a lot of tests and researches before we got to that conclusion ."
Anxiety,eysnkpa,t1_eyrjwik,1567404905.0,I went to a psychiatrist and she just prescribed me Cipralex and Lexaurin.

sex,eu7df6e,t3_cer3zx,1563527246.0,"I‚Äôve read previously about vaginal orgasms but I never believed I could have one. And this weekend it happenned! The sex was so intense I even started crying. I know this is pretty common , but it was the first time it happenned to me. I‚Äôm still hooked on that moment. Girls you deserve to achieve the vaginal orgasm! I wish you good luck ( even to boys/ make her come that way she‚Äôll be surprised)"
