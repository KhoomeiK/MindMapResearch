Anxiety,fojznhn,t3_fnz5n3,1587832593.0,"Thought it was pretty interesting to share; my city recently put in place a “snitching” hotline to use if anyone sees groups of people breaking social distancing rules. In the first week, the hotline had received 97 reports. Out of those 97 call-ins, 98% of them came from people over the age of 65. 13% male and 84% female. And 58% of those call ins where bogus reports. This meant people who were simply walking their dogs, families walking down the street with a baby stroller, and even a report of two brothers playing basketball in their drive way.

They are sort of debating whether to keep the hotline available or not, seeing as it’s not entirely being used for its intended purpose. The hotline is being abused by the boomer generation to both spread fear amongst the community and to greatly exaggerate their idea that “younger generations are purposely going out and ignoring social distancing rules cause their evil blah blah blah blah” while the same people who make these call-ins still visit their friends at the park and have large book meetings in their homes.

Borris did bring this entirely 100% on himself. It wasn’t like he was minding his own business listening the experts to stay home and to social distance. The man was literally going to hospitals, shaking infected peoples hands, entirely exposing himself to large quantities of the virus. There seems to be correlation that if you don’t follow procedures and social distance, you’re gonna get the virus 10 times out of 10.

Social distancing IS showing to be very effective. Borris is an example of what NOT to do during a pandemic. The faster people begin to realize this, the faster we can kick this viruses butt, and begin going back to normal.

STAY INSIDE. Borris didn’t do this, and now he is facing the consequences."

You almost NEVER hear about the surging amount of recoveries of the virus worldwide, or that only like 2% of cases or something like that are severe. But the media makes it seem like everyone is going to die and that there is nothing we can do.

Most models are starting to show that we would be lucky if 5% of the world caught the virus, but the numbers are looking no different from the H1N1 pandemic, and even then, there wasn’t this amount of panic and disinformation being spread during that time.

This is serious yes, and should continue to be taken seriously, but nothing is more worse then the amount of fear and panic being generated mostly by social media and news itself. More people are recovering then dying and an extremely high ratio, yet you will never see that on the front page."

We’ve been plagued all season with injuries to some key people, now wheels is rocking the tinted visor, he is definitely playing through something, but is kept in the lineup because wheeler not in our lineup would be detrimental to our playoff push. Same with laine, and that it was sort of hinted throughout the season that he had been dealing with some sort of nagging injury. Again taking laine out of the lineup would be detrimental to our team. Schief has also taken quite the beating this season, and I’m 100% positive he is playing through an injury. Now jomo is “day-to-day” with what seems to be a ubi, but I have a feeling that it’s something more serious. Wouldn’t be shocked if he was out longer, with a Lowry type injury.

This could explain a lot of the weird line jumbles. We all now Maurice loves line matching, and these wonky lines like having ehlers on the third could be a direct correlation. 

I’ll say it again, if we didn’t have all these injuries, buff situation, etc, we would be singing a different tune. This entire season has been super unfortunate for the jets in nearly every way. Cursed I tell ya."
