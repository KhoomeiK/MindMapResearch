But first and foremost, it's important to remember that a majority of people are selfish and won't feel empathy if it's not something that either affected them or they have experienced in the past.

A lot of women don't like to be with a man who opens up early on. It's not that we don't like emotional men, it's just that we need to build trust before we can be sympathetic with someone and in return we are going to be also more open and share our painful experiences. 

Everyone has similar bad story with the opposite gender. My ex broke my rib 5 days before I had to get an abortion and then stole hundreds of euros from me, insulted me and told everyone that I cheated on him (when he did it multiple times as per his confessions). This put a huge dent on my trust in men and it took me 4 years to get over it and I would blame men for everything - from my depression that started when I was a child to my eating disorder. All I can advise here is to give time to yourself to heal. Don't try to date. Try to connect with women who also went through painful experiences and understand how they feel, see how you relate your feelings to their feelings.

And cut ties with people who make you feel in a negative way. Removing the bad people from my life is ultimately what helped me tremendously through therapy. Only keep people you know care about you and can support you through hard times."
