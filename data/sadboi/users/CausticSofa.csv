Smart is not as culturally in-style right now as it has been during several other points in history. What’s *in* right now is very reactive, easily offended and self-centrically believing differing opinions are personal attacks, as social media loves to remind us.

I’m not trying to negatively judge people for however they choose to approach life, so long as they aren’t actively trying to hurt or detract from the liberty and happiness of others, but I find it impossible to form a romantic connection with a man who can’t think critically or challenge me mentally. Sure, gym bods can be pretty, but the discussions are what will attract me. It’s not that I feel superior, there are plenty of cons to being unable to stop analyzing and pondering. When they’re nice humans, the “happy, dopey, life-of-the-party” guy/gal seems like an awesome person to be. Ignorance may very well be bliss.

I truly dislike the term sapiosexual, but it’s clearly what I am. Potentially you are, too. Luckily, the pendulum always swings, my friend. We’ve swung pretty hard into worshipping ignorance these last 2 decades.

AskReddit,fnn4gxh,t1_fnk55wq,1587084210.0,"There’s actually a really interesting documentary about Freaks and Geeks. They delve into the cancellation of it and how the actors and writers felt about it since they had already grown so fond of the show. They even interviewed the executive who was mainly behind the decision to axe the show and he seems to have a ton of remorse about it now, not just because the show became a cult classic but because he seems to have developed more appreciation for it himself."
DiagnoseMe,fnl6u41,t3_fwaspp,1587048117.0," Hey there. I can’t offer any opinions on a diagnosis and I definitely have no experience that I am aware of with PID but BV is not necessarily associated with STI‘s. It’s just when certain bacterium that naturally live in the vaginal area overpower the dominant lactobacillus species that are supposed to be the primary strains in there and which would normally keep everything around a mid-level to slightly acidic pH of 3.5 to about 4.2.

Some of the things that might be triggering the BV are: if you’re having unprotected sex with your partner (semen is very base), douching (please never douche) and a high fat diet.  The high-fat diet risk is the newest thing that I learned about a month ago in the BV battle. It’s the sort of food BV-type bacterium eat. There was a very good comprehensive study I read a paper on. Google BV high-fat diet correlation and you might be able to find the abstract.  Try to work on reducing your junk food fat intake and increase your plain, unflavoured yoghurt intake. There’s definitely also correlation between yoghurt intake and healthy vaginal bacteria. You want to turn your body back into an environment that is nourishing the good bacteria and starving the bad bacteria.

 I wish I could help more with all the rest of it too, but that’s all the information I have. Best of luck. I hope this clears up one piece for you."
