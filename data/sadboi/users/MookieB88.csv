This platters on this deck were on springs which were supposed to act like suspension on a car, so if anyone bumped into them, the record wouldn‚Äôt jump, that was the theory, it didn‚Äôt work so well in practice.

DJs at the time were expected to also be MC‚Äôs, except I was terrified of speaking on the microphone, but I was only about 15 and so I just shut up and played music. 

The gigs were all weddings, birthday parties and various social events and most of the time people just wanted to hear chart toppers and classics. This was in 1985, so it was only a decade or so after The Beatles split up and believe me, people still wanted to hear that. 

My life changed when I heard Jack Your Body by Steve Silk Hurley in my local record shop. I‚Äôd got to know them in there and they managed to get me a white label of it. I didn‚Äôt even know what a white label was at that point. 

I started playing it along with some Electro that I‚Äôd become known for (breakdancing was popular in the UK at this point) and I also introduced some early hip hop into my sets.

Everyone said I played great music that they‚Äôd never heard before and they appreciated that I didn‚Äôt interrupt the music with inane chatter. 

I started getting bookings to play nightclubs and had to lie about my age because you were supposed to be 18. I posted about my first club experience the other day. Let‚Äôs just say it still keeps me awake at night :) 

The first ‚Äúrave‚Äù I played was in Warrington in the UK in an old warehouse. I had no idea it was illegal, I just showed up to play. That was an incredible experience, nothing like a club or the other gigs I was used to.

I showed up about an hour before my set (with two flight cases full of vinyl) and the guy on the door said it was a private party and I couldn't come in. I said I was DJing and he said ""not here and not tonight you're not"".

This was before mobile phones, so I had no real way of contacting the guy who booked me. I hung around for a while waiting to see if I could recognize someone. I asked the guy on the door again why he wouldn't simply check with someone else, he basically told me to fuck off and stop bothering him. 

I walked to the back of the club and ended up going in through a fire exit that bar staff were using to come in and out. I asked one of them where I needed to go and they all just shrugged and said to go and ""find"" the manager. So I literally had to walk through the crowd with two flight cases to try and find someone who knew who I was. 

No luck.....so I just headed to the DJ booth. The guy who was playing looked at me and asked what the fuck I was doing? I said I was booked to play and he laughed and said ""I don't think so"" and carried on doing his thing. 

So at this point, I'm like, what the fuck am I supposed to do? So I went home. 

Next time I saw the guy, he was like, dude, where where you....turns out I went to completely the wrong venue and they'd been searching high and low for me at the actual venue. Tough lesson learned that day, which is don't take bookings when you're high as a kite."

I‚Äôm fortunate that I‚Äôm in a position to pay fully out of pocket for a both and I‚Äôm getting very good treatment, which now includes no antidepressants and I‚Äôm doing reasonably well. 

So far I‚Äôve spent approximately $15,000 this year which is enough to make you fucking depressed on its own!"

It‚Äôs no coincidence it‚Äôs election year, they know they can reach an infinitely bigger audience by headlining Coachella, in fact, I‚Äôd argue this is typical RATM. Working within the system they hate in order to affect change."

Productivity gain? To me it sounds like you‚Äôre talking more about production than DJing and I don‚Äôt mean that in a derogatory way."

11 days ‚Äúin prison‚Äù isn‚Äôt a deterrent and costs society valuable tax dollars. 

I‚Äôd advocate for huge means tested fines, which go towards community & social programs. This, coupled with a few thousand hours of serving at homeless shelters or similar would be much more effective."
Beatmatch,f60nsa4,t3_dpz11u,1572621801.0,"I‚Äôll disagree here. 

There is nothing wrong with using whatever coding system that works for you.....but, organization of your library is not close to being important.

You simply need to ‚Äúknow‚Äù your music, intimately. Keep your ‚Äúlive‚Äù library small, quality over quantity and once you‚Äôve got a pool of 100 tracks, then operate a strict one in, one out policy.

It‚Äôs a one of the best disciplines I‚Äôve learnt over the years. If you can‚Äôt make a great set out of 100 highly curated songs, then you‚Äôve got more fundamental issues! 

Sure, have a bigger pool of music to draw from, I have around 3,000 tracks that are fully prepped for performance, but I‚Äôll only go outside of the 100 in my ‚Äúlive‚Äù library in emergencies. I usually take a couple of USB‚Äôs and a back up portable hard drive with me. The USB‚Äôs only have my live library on. 

I know each of those 100 songs inside out, and not only the actual song, but also the specific mix that made the cut."

All around it was a magical night and I'd highly recommend the full concert video if you like this snippet."
