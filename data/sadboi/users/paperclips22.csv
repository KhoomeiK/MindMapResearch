To be honest, I am pretty lucky with people around me, they stick around even tho I am a mess. 

Sometimes I need to get out of my comfort zone tho. I have to swallow my words when all I wanna do is scream. 

When I got diagnosed it all made sense. It helped me a lot to get why I am the way I am. 

Remember you are not a bad person; you are just sick, and just like any sickness, you need to take your medications. It will help a lot. Also, there's a book about this, called ""I hate you; don't leave me"". It all made sense once I read it. 

I hope this helps. You can write to me whenever you need to so we can talk about this :)"

AskReddit,esuh1i8,t3_c95wvl,1562283332.0,"ok, reading the comments I agree with a lot. 

1) acne/pimples: we all have them, and it's actually kinda fun to squeeze them. 

2) weight: guys who are too skinny or too fat or not ""muscular"" enough feel they need a six pack. I really feel weird with bodies like that, and cuddling is not so good with someone extremely fit. 

3) height: I am a tall woman so yes, I rather date someone taller than me, but still, if you are kinda clever and kinda fun, is better than dating a fucking moai who doesn't speak. Also, there's nothing you can do to change it so whh bother. 

4) dick size: hey, some of the best orgasms can be given by the tip of a finger, so, at least for me, dick size is not what is going to make the sex better or worse. And again, you can't change it. 

5) being popular: I like to go out and talk to people and like that, but I hate the idea of HAVING to go out everytime because there's always something; sometimes is nice to just be the two of us watching netflix. We don't HAVE to party EVERYTIME. 

6) money: hey, we should pay for our stuff. Yes, sometimes I don't have that much money so you can pay, but when you don't have the money I'll pay. Is not *a man's* thing.

EDIT: 7) being emotional: it's OK to cry, to get angry, to be happy. I want to know what's going on with you, you don't have to be a stone. Nobody is. 

Something new for me is dating someone who has dated a lot more than me. This made me feel kinda weird at first, but now I really don't care, it just means he has dated more. Nothing else. 

To me is more important that you're honest, make me laugh and make me think. The rest we can work it out."
