ptsd,fpmch90,t3_ge3p67,1588730084.0,Yes aha. My brain has made me forget his name so I fill with rage towards someone who's name I can't even recall.
ptsd,fpit1nv,t3_gdosq3,1588648063.0,"I take a few meds! I take Cipralex for the depression (it also helps a bit with anxiety). The cipralex didn't cut it for my anxiety however so we added Buspirone which has been very helpful. For night terrors I'm on something called prazosin, it doesn't stop the terrors all together but it helps suppress the physical outbursts which in turn helps me feel a bit more rested. 

I've been on this combo for years with minor adjustments and it's the only combination that has worked thus far !"
ptsd,fpirly8,t3_gdlsrs,1588647155.0,"When I was about 14/15 I was an impatient and at the time I was 'pre-diagnosed' with Borderline Personality Disorder (I've heard this is a very common misdiagnoses for those with C-PTSD). I spent the 3 years following that going on and off of different meds and eventually I quit cold turkey (I went through a ""I'm too young to be this broken and medicated phase). 

Eventually when I was in college I was reassessed and was told I have C-PTSD. I then started on meds again and have been living much more comfortably since ! 

Its changed the way I view my symptoms. It's also allowed me to be really introspective about what I'm experiencing. I am also very fortunate that my mother has C-PTSD and is someone I can lean on or go to for insight."
ptsd,fpgjne4,t1_fpfc40r,1588604018.0,"That's very interesting ! I haven't had an evaluation for OCD but I do know that I have at least one other symptom of OCD (compulsive skin picking). I will definitely ask my next therapist for an assessment, thank you for this comment !"
ptsd,fpgj57w,t1_fpgigyq,1588603736.0,"I spent awhile looking for a therapist in my area who does EMDR, found one and then she accidentally broke the confidentiality of all her clients (sent me their email addresses) so naturally I have lost my trust in her ðŸ˜«
Been searching for another therapist since but COVID-19 has really halted my plans. 
I really hope that it is something trying to come up! I would love to be free of this."
