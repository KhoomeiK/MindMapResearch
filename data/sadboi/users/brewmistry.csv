It's such an absurdly stressful job, with ridiculous expectations, and then there is the pressure you put on yourselves because we have to be everything to everyone all the time time and it always seems like we just get shit on by people who could never do our jobs. And we can't even disclose. 

I quit teaching middle school for two years and it was the best thing I could do. I found a kind of shitty job but it paid well and I could use a bathroom whenever I wanted. 

The struggle is real, our brain chemistry makes it worse. We're in the middle of a global Pandemic. Phone it in, direct parents to Admin, and walk away in 2 months. You can always go back. 

This is a bad idea, you deserve better, give yourself a chance to see how things are when you're not being kicked around by your job. 

You're awesome, you're a fucking bad Ass, so few people can do what we do with the illness we have . Please remember this."
bipolar,fmly6qw,t3_fw1k0l,1586195351.0,"For me it's a large enough breach of trust that I would have to leave. This isn't something like don't mention my tattoos. This is don't mention a very intimate aspect of my life because I am quite concerned about the reaction of people I need to accept me. 
If nothing else the anxiety of visiting his family would be overwhelming for me."
bipolar,fmjg68v,t3_fvlgpm,1586129674.0,I feel you. It's been a ridiculous amount of highs and lows these past couple of weeks regardless of something going on or not. I've just been putting on something stupid on tv or very loud music and letting myself feel it.
bipolar,f8eo4ry,t1_f8egru4,1574531151.0,"Don't tell people, just push through. Much easier said than done, but I went to college  way after 18. I told the people that I had to what I was doing but mainly I just kept working and taking night classes. My SO's were well on there way to film and web dev careers but they pushed me to.
Do what you want to do how you can."
Teachers,f6dwiwk,t3_dr1qb9,1572797630.0,I've never once had to say it or urge my students to recite it either. They have to stand but that's it.
