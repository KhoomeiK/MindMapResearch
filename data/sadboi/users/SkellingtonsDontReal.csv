With regular use and using more than a therapeutic dose you’re increasing your risk for withdrawal. 

It’s totally fine to not be ready to stop. Pregabalin is an amazing substance that helps tons of people. But I suggest that you would get the most out of this substance by dividing that dose up throughout the day. If you suffer from anxiety this may be your saving grace."
