Also I have very little awareness of my own body and how I feel, so when I would start drinking and such often I would have no idea how far I went until I went too far. 

The funny thing is, going through that, I couldn’t imagine going to a group like AA or anything because it just felt like a a cult to me lmao. Again, I just sort of worked through the issue myself"

I mean, sure, I guess Jesus was just some guy, too, but at this point it’s so universal in western culture I get more why people follow it. Maybe it’s a hope to feel special, like, “I was a disciple of the modern Jesus”. Idk."

I think to some extent people really do use excuses for their behavior like “I was drunk” or “I was brainwashed” but I try to be a little more forgiving now that I understand people all operate differently. I myself have struggled with alcohol and drug addiction, and I’ve both used alcohol as an excuse for my behavior, and I’ve also legitimately completely blacked out before.

Alcoholism can cause increased loss of certain vitamins and minerals, so I would look into which supplements might be helpful for you as you recover to help with some of the withdrawal symptoms. 

This may not be an option for you, but you can also consider going to a facility or at least seeing a doctor to come up with a sobriety plan because even though it’s “just” alcohol, detoxing can literally kill you if you do it too quickly. I did not think I was *that* addicted, but after being hospitalized for a different issue, the doctors told me I had to be medically supervised because I was at risk or arrhythmia after having a depressant in my system for so long. I was given daily injections of something to reduce the withdrawal symptoms.
