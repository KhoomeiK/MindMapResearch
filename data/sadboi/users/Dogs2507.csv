The problem is she asked but does not like my answer. I raised 3 children on my own no help no child support and they turned out amazing. My daughter has ADHD with LD and an IEP. I raised her to focus on the things she does best and to forget about her weak areas. It's a realistic approach to provide someone with the right coping skills. My daughter is now getting her PhD. She never went through a stage of where she ""really disliked people with adhd, autism, LD... if you provide a living and caring environment and listen so your kids can talk to you it's rather easy and always fun! I'm not buying your ""she's still growing, she's on 12, 15, 18, her brain is on fire crap. I also think that you need to think about this.... How about that one kid that overheard one of her comments?? Those are the real kids that need the help from
Bullies like her. I would say this whether my family members have adhd or not. Haven't you read? We are so perceptive, we can jump into a persons brain and know where they are going before they do.  We are unbelievably talented... my dad was a guitarist, I am a guitarist, my niece is 13 and singing the blues in nightclubs... my nephew is an unbelievable guitarist, my younger brother retired at 32 because he thought of an app that know one else had and Apple went public with it a year ago. We are twice as smart, ten times more creative have built in maps in our heads no need for the Waze app. If I could talk to the people that overheard her remarks... that's where the gift is.. not with her. I'm done delete it don't delete it. I won't respond to any more comments."

Her heart is programmed to hate and she's fully aware of this... she's self aware enough to know how she feels towards people that are different from herself. If she was a good person she would not walk but run for help. The fact that she admits that she actually ""Says things"" about people with her friends.... do you really think that she was never overheard?  I blame her parents (we all know they know but did nothing), she's asking on Reddit instead of sitting on a therapist couch for a solid 10 years...I'm a realist.... these are the facts because if she had done anything to get help, she wouldn't be on here. She can't stand people that are different.... because she's a rotten person through to her core. I don't hate anyone hate is a strong word but I certainly do not feel sorry for her I'm just so glad she's not my kid (I wouldn't raise a kid like that), I'm so glad that she's not in my life but I feel bad for the people that overheard her remarks so I wish she would just build a boat go find a deserted island and stay there until she dies."

A cop will be able to walk your home any-time-they-see-fit!!.  The public is just not aware of the dishonest fraudulent actions by these morally depraved human beings.  I research them for a living.... the very people that decide if you can take painkillers or not, the people that decide if some cop can tear through your drawers faster than Grant took Richmond, the people you depend on to do the right thing as the banks, attorneys, title companies, appraisers, notaries (and their employees) get rich on foreclosed properties... over and over and over and it's so frustrating Because they are morally repugnant reprehensible people because they don't care about anyone but themselves.  One thing - There are great lawyers out there....

PainManagement,fdsjeoc,t1_fdgq2t9,1578703889.0,"This guy had been working on cars at General Motors for 30 years.  Not 5 or 10 but 30. One of the parts failed and a part of a car fell on him and he has had 6 surgeries on his back and collarbone.  He is on disability.  His doctor abandoned him, left their state, retired early after suffering from severe panic attacks every time he wrote a script for any pain meds. He wasn't doing anything wrong they said.... in fact he was under prescribing but the panic of writing them was debilitating. He is now a dog walker for wags. The guy from GM can't find a doctor that will prescribe him pain meds...  the pain has left him in bed, suffering from severe depression, anxiety and pain so bad he cried... all day. He had had 2 suicide attempts.  I was born in late 1960's my dad a decorated Marine. I was raised to believe in and love my Country and I do... very much. I cannot stand the woman, who was politically connected and rich and gave and gave to the liberal idiots that took her story and used her disgusting selfish misuse of political connections for her own person gain. Her daughter attempted suicide twice and was successful on her third shot after she got hold of her fathers pain meds (a bottle just filled with 90 pills). This horrible excuse of a human being also used her daughter's suicide against her ex husband blaming him for leaving them in his nightstand top drawer... so, she looked great to her friends by making her ex look horrible (forget how he felt after she announced it to the world), and because she never worked a day in her life she took her bullshit story, withholding major information and became a major participant and paid liberal politicians to run around like the corrupt idiots that they are and now she actually uses the story to define her. I love Donald Trump but I also know him because I filled in as his corporate flight attendant over a period of 5 years.  You need to pick and choose your battles so he had to jump on this bandwagon.  However, our forefathers wrote the Constitution to protect our individual freedom and all our government does is come up with more and more reasons to get involved, stay involved and tell US WHAT WE CAN AND CANNOT DO. PERIOD. We have turned into the ""nanny state'.  What fucking nerve they have to take painkillers away from a man that is in screaming crying pain every minute of every day.... who the fuck are they to tell a women with cancer that spread to her bones that she cannot take something for the pain.  If anything, why don't they investigate how many kids die from herion overdoses? Why don't they go to the worst area in Say San Fran, NY, Chicago.... stand in a dark alley and watch the people smoking crack or shooting up?? Where are these fucking idiots while that's going on?? Go after the pregnant mom crack addict who is getting someone who had absolutely no say addicted to their demons. Instead, our sick demented, selfish, stuck up, narcissistic gaslighters that made the decision to take the guy that worked for GM off his pain meds and woke up one morning saw how his pain and depression were impacting his family and killed himself because he couldn't take it anymore.  I hope the idiotic moronic horrifying excuses for human behavior mgs that started this ridiculous bullshit crusade get the very worst cancer.... no.. wait... one of their loved ones gets the worst cancer and every single day they watch their loved one go through what the poor GM guy did..... that is my wish for them. But, let's get real... if anyone out there believes for one single second that if they or a loved one gets their DWI and there head goes flying in the windshield and they feel even the slightest bit of pain.... if anyone out there believes that a fairly well known politician or one that donates an endless amount of money to them, cannot get painkillers as many and for whatever ails them.... you need to get your head out of the clouds and land back on Earth! So, this is my answer to the nice reddit member that has asked....""What the heck is going back on""?
