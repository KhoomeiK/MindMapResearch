SuicideWatch,fm8zd7m,t1_fm8tofi,1585858816.0,"The thing is, I've put in 14 hours in a day before, come home and cleaned the kitchen, then cooked dinner, and still made an effort to out in time with her. She, on the other hand, is overwhelmed by just cooking breakfast and lunch (and there are usually leftovers for lunch that just need microwaved), and doing laundry and dishes. 

I'd love to do some financial planning, but i can't do it without cooperation. We've tried before, and the only way it works is if I hound her for receipts and I just don't have time or energy for that bullshit. I tried having her track it, I told her every penny I spent, and I spoke to her before making any purchases over $50 and most over $20. I would literally call her and check before I bought ab $20 concert ticket to make sure we didn't exceed the budget, and we still went over the budget. 

Not worrying about money would ease the strain for me, but I doubt it would make much difference to the relationship.

Edit: It probably sounds like I'm looking for excuses to wallow in self pity, and that's probably at least partly true. Thanks for trying to be helpful, but I might be a lost cause."
SuicideWatch,fm7g873,t1_fm6plyb,1585825852.0,"Between work and the time I've been in school, I've been putting in 50+ hours per week for 15 years and I've got nothing to show for it. I can barely keep up with the interest on my student loans. Even after my wife started as an RN bringing in a lot more income last year, the money just disappears somehow. 

She had her homework spread over the coffee table and almost the whole didn't room table for two years, and I kept the kids out of it, but I have to get everything out to do my homework and out it all away every single time. If I leave so much as a piece of paper out, it will be scribbled on with crayon or lost when I come back to it. She had hours every day to study while the kids were at daycare, but I get home from work at 5:30 and I can't even get started on homework and study until well after 8:00. I know others have gone through school while working, and people keep telling me I can do it, but everyone I know who's done it had some support at home. While she was in school, I took over a good portion of household responsibilities, but I'm working full-time while in school, and I still have to keep track of bills to be paid, I'm in charge of all house and vehicle maintenance, and I still end up getting sucked into comforting her when she's having a rough day, which is almost every day. 

My marriage is circling the drain. I saw the writing on the wall 5 years ago, but it doesn't feel like she's taking it seriously when I talk to her. We've started counseling, but I don't feel like she's putting much into that either. I've asked her to get up early enough that we could spend even 5 minutes together before the kids become a distraction. Even while she's on leave from work, she won't do that. While she was working, I got up at 5 and cooked her breakfast every day for a week, even though I had been up studying past 11, and she can't get out of bed before 8 for me. If I want to spend any quality time with her, I have to stay up late for just a chance.

My kids always want me to play with them, and it kills me to have to keep telling them I'm too busy. Every time I do, I'm falling behind on homework and housework. 

There is just not enough of me to go around, and I can't see a point where it gets any better. I can't see anything that I can put aside to make things easier. I could quit my job and let my debt grow while I'm in school and basically never pay it off. I could quit school again and let all the work I've out in go to waste. I could divorce and have even less time with my kids. I could quit doing all the maintenance and let the house and vehicles fall apart.

My biggest regret is having children. If it weren't for them I'd be gone by now. I've kept going for their sake, but I don't know how much longer I can do it."
