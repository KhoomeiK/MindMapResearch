rutgers,fp6so0f,t1_fp6sbk3,1588357915.0,Lol? Or they just do redo an experiment or thesis without penalty. I work in Pharmaceuticals and have plenty of PhD friends in labs and none of them ever get ridiculed for a failure. Instead they get back together with others doing similar work and find out what they can adjust or if there is an issue with a control.
rutgers,fp6s0xl,t1_fp6q709,1588357602.0,You realize most people who get to the PhD level are very much sharing information and taking information from other people's  research and theories correct?
rutgers,fp68tj1,t1_fp68lqg,1588348143.0,All that does is tell me you have accepted you're wrong and have out of date world views. So congratulations on your personal growth. Hopefully in the future you'll use everything available to you so you don't have to work quite so hard. Who knows maybe you won't need a new career again if you start giving your employer correct solutions.
rutgers,fp67qfo,t1_fp673yz,1588347590.0,"Yeah and that boomer mentality has served us so well. You worked hard and did so well that did so well that you ""retired"", but now need to go back to school to start a new career. We have thousands of resources available today to ensure accuracy - not using them is dumb. To put it simply I'm ten times more likely to hire someone who gave me the right answer because they looked it up over someone who worked hard and got it wrong."
rutgers,fp65wy4,t1_fp6568y,1588346659.0,Wow you're really mad about this aren't you?  You sound like someone with no idea how life works outside of academia so hopefully that's your career field because you're in for a rude awakening otherwise. And honestly there really isn't a reason to give exams.  There are other ways to ensure your students are actually learning that don't put so much stress and anxiety on them. It's called being smart and using the resources around you - not lazy.
rutgers,fp62pxh,t1_fp62ibp,1588344949.0,If looking up an answer to ensure you're providing the correct solution is cheating then maybe Academic standards should change to better serve the students paying thousands of dollars to attend university.  College should be preparing you for a career in your field and there is no field where you can't just look up.an answer if you don't  know something.
rutgers,fp5768q,t1_fp571f5,1588318664.0,I agree with that. Just from when I used Chegg they generally had the answer but also how to work through and get that solution. Always found it really helpful to be honest. Doing something like this and making it  known also has the negative effect of making students now question the answers they're getting from sites like Chegg which can be valuable resources.
rutgers,fp54hp2,t3_gayjuc,1588316021.0,"This whole situation is dumb. No one cares outside of college if you look up an answer or solution for something.  In fact it's highly encouraged that if you don't know how to do something you should probably find a guide or ask someone.  Exams in general with no aids or assistance allowed do a terrible job of preparing students for the workforce - ""don't know this off the top of your head? Too bad just guess and get it wrong even though you could quickly Google or YouTube a solution video which will walk you through it, and save a ton of stress and headache."""
recruitinghell,fo7ncud,t1_fo7k6lu,1587581285.0,"I'd prefer you make up a few smaller specific time slots. As a corporate recruiter when I get candidates who are specific about their availability and other job functions im much more likely to want to invest time in them. It shows a certain value that you have for your time and our company wants people who value their time. Also a lot of time it is much simpler to go ""Okay you're available at 11:45am - we're booked and I'll call you directly.""  Instead of going back and forth with a big time block

Edit: Also to add on because I'm asking I almost always state in my initial email the times I'm unavailable as well as giving my work number so candidates can text me if they need to reschedule or if I am running late."
recruitinghell,fo70fq0,t1_fo6ydvf,1587570051.0,"Available between the hours of x and y. Or just don't give a range and pick a time. I hate when I ask candidates for a time they're available and they give me an answer of all day or some 9 hour range. I'm purposely asking for a time that works for them. Don't answer questions with questions either like ""when works for you?""

Edit: I got down voted for offering my perspective as a corporate recruiter.  None of you are getting interviews now -_-"

A lot of my female friends are all people I've done varying levels of things with before, and when I do have a solid GF unless she asks I don't mention it.

Why my sample was never sent I'll never understand.  Thanks for the well wishes and hopefully things get better soon as I've had quite a few secondary complications just from the flu part
Coronavirus,flw8vdr,t1_flumquv,1585542883.0,I was exposed to someone who tested positive and displayed all the symptoms. I had to go to the ER before anyone would even do basic cold and flu testing. The hospital also told me they took a covid sample and they would follow up. I had two conflicting calls - one telling me I was positive for Flu and another the next day saying I was negative for flu. That was the last follow up until I called them two days ago to find out what was going on. They said I was positive for Flu and they never sent my covid sample because I was young and relatively healthy (clear lungs). I'm still symptomatic and I've been sick for 3 weeks. They told me not to come back in to the hospital unless I felt like I was dying.

recruitinghell,fjbwqlw,t3_fcjku8,1583203121.0,"Are you applying through an agency or a direct recruiter with the company? If agency could be any number of things from the recruiter not actually having permission to submit candidates, to the company finding their own candidate, or restructuring in the organization. 

If you applied through the company directly then most likely someone was further along in the interview process and an offer was extended or being extended and they aren't sure if the candidate will accept.

In this situation I didn't know her at all before that night but she was out with friends who were very happy when we started talking at the bar (cheering and encouraging her) so I figured she might have felt some pressure just from that alone and I made sure to just take things at her pace. But I wish that it wasn't so shocking for her how I reacted and that I could do more to help raise awareness about this feeling of obligation sex and how it's not okay."
