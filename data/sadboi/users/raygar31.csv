apexlegends,fr2m9ak,t1_fr2irkf,1589839784.0,"It’s amazing how you can start out with “How is this blindly defending the devs?!”, and then you continue to BLINDLY DEFEND THE DEVS.

“No matter how much you invest”- they haven’t invested anything you idiot. 20 fucking tick servers. That right there should tell you they don’t give a fuck. 

Yes bugs happen, but bugs this fucking huge should not make it into an update of this size. Maybe they should have been more prepared, that’s a form a investment and they clearly didn’t do.

And how on earth are you arguing they’re not being cheap? These companies exist to make AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE. So if they can make a shit game, on shit servers, with a shit amount of devs, that’s what they’re going to do. Do you not understand how capitalism works? It’s about getting as much money as you can. It’s not about doing a good job, providing a good service, or making sure things work as intended. It’s about as much money as possible. Cheaping out on servers, due diligence, teams of coders is saving them money. Money they clearly don’t need to spend because idiots like you will eat up whatever garbage they put out and praise them after."

This poorly running game is now constantly failing to register bullets (in a First Person Shooter btw, kinda a big deal) and yet you want to celebrate them for acknowledging the issue in some trello board rather than actually solving it. Yes, fixes aren’t immediate but this is a huge issue that shouldn’t even have made it into the update. It just shows how cheap and lazy Respawn is when it comes to servers/performance but why invest money into making your game function well when there are plenty of idiots out there who will defend you no matter what."

He wants so little to change that it will result in energized conservative voters in 2024. He’s senile, a sexual predator and as out of touch as any Republican. 

So he’s senile and incompetent

He doesn’t represent real change for America

He’s less likely to win a bipartisan general election than Sanders

Less likely to win a potential re-election than Sanders

What do we have to lose with Sanders running as an independent??? Seriously? If Sanders doesn’t become President, what chance does democracy have to survive in this country? Two more conservative Supreme judges will decimate our country. Just look at how much the GOP has destroyed the rule of law in less than 4 years. Look at how much they’ve consolidated power. This is the turning point in our country’s history. If anyone but Sanders wins the Presidency, America will either become a authoritarian state or will suffer a true revolution, the kind were millions die and we collectively destroy everything before we rebuild."

Not only has the Trump denied this, but the GOP is also actively preventing any sort of election security bill to counter it. Americans conservatives are absolutely shameless when it comes to what methods they use to defeat the opposition. The politicians are shameless, their base is shameless. There is literally nothing they could do, in attempt to keep power, that would lose the support of their base. If Trump declares martial law, cancels the election, arrests his opponents, and starts wearing a crown...his base will still support him. Either because they agree or because they think the big bad socialist libruls would be worse. 

So we have a man who needs the presidency to avoid jail. An entire party committed to keeping him in power. A base that will support ANYTHING they do.
