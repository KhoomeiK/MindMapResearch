It’s better for me to have reserves than none. Some people just spend what they have.

Our neighborhood is called Let's Help Each Other!

It's exactly what you think: we help each other. We would really like someone who will participate in the derby. We're currently back at Expert League, but we've been going back and forth with Professional and Expert League because of participation.

We are all helpful to each other and we have fun playing the game. We chat, but I don't think we're overbearing. 

The minimum level requirement is 58, but most of us are now around 100+ and a small chunk of us are between 60-100. 

I ask that you please be respectful and play nice. Otherwise, we have to give you the boot. Remember, it's just a game. We play in the derby, help each other, and have fun.

GhostAdventures,fe925bi,t3_enmkv9,1578933319.0,"I’ve been a fan of GA since the documentary. I was hooked because I was a ghost hunter and thought this guy Zak would be helpful in evolving as a ghost hunter. I think if you’ve never been ghost hunting (as a serious thing, not one of those, “haha wouldn’t it be funny if” nights) then I’m not sure you would appreciate what it’s like to be in complete darkness and not be able to explain how something even darker is around you and you can’t see two inches in front of your face. Also the GAC pushes boundaries and does truly scary things as a person with real fears. Also for anyone who says they’re just acting: do you really think Zak or Aaron or Dakota or any one of them can really pull that off? They’re terrible actors. For so long Zak sounded awkward when he was reading scripted lines. I just think if you’re only in it for the entertainment factor and don’t believe in the paranormal, it’s no wonder you’d think this show is a stupid and fake and they over react. I’ve only been to haunted places that have a local lore or urban legend and my friends and I would try to prove whether or not it was real. Just as a person who is in a dark place in the middle of nowhere, I was already terrified. Put yourself in the same position and try to act like it’s not scary. It’s the opposite of feeling safe. I don’t go ghost hunting any more but it’s enough for me to watch this show. Also GA goes to already famously haunted places. Zak went from trying to prove that the paranormal exists to filming each investigation as a story. I love how he tells the story each episode. I think there’s not that many new episodes because these experiences take a lot out of you. And as much as Zak and his crew leaves themselves open to these hauntings, they probably need time between investigations. I think Zak cares less about his fans because his priority is his mental and emotional health after these investigations. I didn’t go ghost hunting for like a month after hearing an EVP call me by name. If the guys are programming the devices to say certain things at certain times, how are they timing that perfectly? Anyway, that’s my input. Please remember it’s just my opinion and how I feel about the show so please don’t tear me down about it or tell me how stupid I am. If you don’t believe it, fine. If you do, fine."
GhostAdventures,fdp9l1o,t1_fdoxear,1578623196.0,"I would love if they redid the intro. Not the narrative, but the overly-done special effects. I can’t even watch it. I skip thru it bc the rubbing of the fake blood on the lips is just too much."
GhostAdventures,fdp987v,t3_emi5rh,1578622966.0,"I share your pet peeve. However, I agree with what someone already said: he is also a showman. I do believe his show is real, though. You’re giving way too much credit to their acting skills if GA is all fake. They are terrible actors and it would be way too obvious if they were staging everything. Same goes for Dakota’s show, Destination Fear. Zak is also an empath. He has also spent a lot of his adult life as a ghost hunter. Basically he knows his shit. But he also knows how to get the money shot, present it with a bow to The Travel Channel, and be able to narrate an entire investigation like a story. I like it. I mean if it’s real, in my opinion is the best paranormal show. If it’s fake, then I guess he’s the greatest showman. Either way, if you’re a ghost hunter and/or believe in the paranormal, I think you’d be more inclined to know if they’re being real or fake.

It’s ok most of the time but the last few episodes have been kind of annoying with how distracted they get. Em is super sensitive and tries not to offend anyone when it comes to pronouns. But she also dedicates zero time in trying to pronounce names and places correctly when she covers a topic. She also shits on Scorpios so much that it makes me like her significantly less. She’s so afraid of misusing pronouns but openly shits on an astrology sign. Gio is Christine’s dog who is the cutest (check out the ATWWD Podcast Instagram).

There was a time a few years back where Zak seemed really into his ego and I stopped watching for a while.

But back to the point of the person’s comment, I believe they were remaining realistic, which is the kind of perspective that should be presented to someone who is on the fence."
Catholic,fa5hmqs,t1_fa1v4rh,1575815206.0,I think they mean that just because this one turned out successful doesn’t mean that they’re like that and maybe your decision should not be solely based on this.
depression,fa5980h,t3_e7nfx1,1575812896.0,"You described it so perfectly. I experience this too. I always attributed it to my depression. I feel out of place with both friends and family, though mostly with friends. I feel like I could back out of the social circle at any time and no one would notice. But I don’t, because then If I’m right, my depression would only get worse. So when they eventually ask how I’m doing or something, I fake a smile and pretend like everything is ok. Truthfully I would also like to crawl into a ball and just die. Family functions also make me feel this bad because I feel they only invite me out of obligation. It’s lonely and terrible and I don’t wish it on anyone. You’re not alone. But it absolutely sucks."
depression,f9whcn3,t3_e6wilf,1575692653.0,"Yes. And also not in a suicidal way. I’ve woken up from dreams genuinely sad that my reality is not that dream. I’ve gone days thinking about it. Eventually I write it down. If nothing else, it makes me feel better that I can write about it."
politics,f9nasn3,t3_e5t31o,1575480664.0,I feel like the press could have passed on this story. This wasn’t breaking news. Spoiler alert: most us mock Trump. He is a buffoon. Just because political officials also do it doesn’t mean it’s breaking news. They’re human(ish) too. My point is that all this story is doing is making Trump angrier so he can be more reckless and talk more shit. We all talk shit about him. It’s not new.
TheNSPDiscussion,f9jmzzy,t3_e1y1kg,1575380258.0,"I feel the same! Still, consider the season pass. I’ve bought the last 2 seasons and the season pass stories are worth it. Most of them, plus the season pass bonus episodes, are better than the free episodes."
TheNSPDiscussion,f9jkkyu,t3_e2ojkx,1575377989.0,"I thought I was alone in this thought. Don’t get me wrong, though. I still listen to the podcast and support it and love the voice actors. The thing is, the endings on a lot of these stories have been disappointing for a while. The content is great, all the way until the end, much like the ending to Lost, because you’re left sitting there like, “...that’s it?” 

I recall the earlier seasons being genuinely scary. Now, some stories feel like it ended abruptly or is incomplete. Separately, there are some stories in the season pass that have blown me away and I have to process it afterward. Like you can feel the characters’ fear. I’m specifically talking about a June episode from season 11 or 12 that was about a cop shooting gays in a bar. I forgot what it is called, but if you have the opportunity to find it and listen, you should. It’s heavy.  Maybe I’m just being a curmudgeon, but the stories just aren’t what they used to be."
