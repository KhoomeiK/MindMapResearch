It is really good to hear your and your friend's experience. Esp. the complete rewards are, as you wrote, may be worth to try. Although I didn't have patience to wait more 36hrs so I've refreshed already.  
  
I agree with that for newbies this new Gulliver system is completely brutal, they don't have even a opportunity to try according to such amount of required materials.  
  
Yet meantime for long time players like me and you it gives opportunities to use materials which beforehand we had to just sell coz they goes max instantly. For instance I like islands of clothes with 250 cotton and 250 paper. I do agree with what you wrote about resources as well like that. 
  
Anyway the point was/is the community got mad with this system. Many users have quit after the latest update. We have to see how Nintendo reacts to our expectations.
