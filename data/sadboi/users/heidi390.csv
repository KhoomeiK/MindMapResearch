relationship_advice,fafkcak,t3_e8zisk,1576024923.0,"This happened in my relationship of 4 years as well. And you will spend months trying new things and feeling like you aren't good enough. But eventually you will have to face that your relationship isn't what it use to be and it's probably over. The intimacy should be there, and if it isn't, and if he doesn't understand that the lack of intimacy is causing problems then the only answer is break up. Sorry, I know you wish there was a fix. But please don't start feeling like you aren't sexy, smart, fun or desirable."

relationship_advice,ex1zzh8,t3_cr5r4p,1565959901.0,The way you talk about people you want to have sex with is obviously only about the sex and that desperate behavior is pretty obvious to most people. Try toning it down. And if you're response here is to get offended and insist that isn't true then it's probably the right answer. Tone it down bro.

When I ran to him for a hug I realized he was dead and all his skin had been peeled off. That's when I woke up, and I still think about it all the time today."

Popcorn is my salty go-to for a chip substitute. The Snyder brand sourdough pretzels have 0 saturated fat so I love to sneak one into my healthy mix to help me feel Fuller. 

The best snack I have come across for the salty fix is dried chickpeas. They are absolutely wonderful! They offer a crunch and come in tons of different flavors. They are low carb, gluten free and I'm sure free of other things. 

Best of all is they are incredibly easy to make on your own. I have seen pre-packaged brands, but that runs the risk of higher fat contents and unknown ingredients."
mentalhealth,esb4fcq,t3_c6q29x,1561777825.0,"I have the same problem! Ever since I was about 6 (29 now) I have gotten violently graphic nightmares that I can still describe in detail. I have read a lot about it and don't know for sure because I am not professionaly trained - but a lot of reading suggests that an anxious or higly active mind can cause highly active night thoughts.

I also have very regularly repetitive stress dreams that occure during certain times when stressors are present. I don't experience night terrors or sleep paralysis, but have a history of sleep walking and my SO regularly tells me that I react outwardly about my nightmares without my knowledge. 

I am really glad you started a convo about this!"

explainlikeimfive,es9lotj,t3_c6k95p,1561739062.0,"Agree - vapor is inhaled to the lungs while ice and water go into the stomach. Eating ice chips is the same as eating water. This is because the body naturally filters air into the lungs through the wind pipe (trachea) and digestable items through the esophagus. water in the air in a gas state is safe to breath, but it may be noticably difficult when humidity is high or if you are in heavy fog, ect... Both of these tubes are in the back of the throat and there is a flap over each tube (epiglottis) which prevents the wrong one from entering. If air enters your stomach in large quantities it will cause gas and discomfort, like when a baby sucks on an empty bottle and then gets fussy because it needs to burp or fart.

Sorry if you already know all that, just wanted to make sure the why was adequately covered!"
