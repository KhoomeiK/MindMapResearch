first she said she would pull me out of school so i couldn’t finish my GCSE exams

then she threatened to stop me going on a trip to Madagascar i had been raising money for for about a year at that point

now she has put herself in charge of my eating because i only have 3 months to recover before going to university. 

TRUST ME the digestive issues will pass, it took me about a week but i was in agony, i felt soooo bloated, i looked like i was pregnant, my stomach was in pain, i felt physically sick, it was horrible. after about a week it started to settle down and i felt much better.

this is the perfect time to re-evaluate what you value most in your life. your happiness and self-worth are not connected to your weight, no matter how you feel at the moment. 

i am definitely not recovered, i know if i were out back in charge of my eating habits tomorrow i would go straight back to starving myself. this is the perfect opportunity for *both* of us to take control, even though it’s scary and uncomfortable.

recovery is *supposed* to feel uncomfortable, if it wasn’t, it means you aren’t doing it right. just try to remember what you value most in your life. it’s difficult but we can do it."

therapy,fqxxowa,t3_glgrk7,1589739431.0,"uuugh i am you every day too. i believe it has everything to do with self-worth and how you think about yourself. if your inner voice is constantly criticising you, bullying you, you will start to believe that voice, and eventually you will start to believe that you are worthless, and everyone already know it. you will start to hear those thoughts come out of everyone else’s mouths. every time you jump to that worse case scenario, that isn’t what *they* think, it’s what *you* think. you’ve convinced yourself everyone hates you because you hate yourself. 

i don’t know how to solve this problem because i’m stuck there too, but we just have to start being kinder to ourselves, even if we don’t think we deserve it."
therapy,fqxwuds,t3_glhu5f,1589739067.0,"at least you already know that changing you appearance isn’t going to make you feel better. you won’t feel better in those new clothes or with that makeup; that means the problem is internal, emotional. if you can find the source of that insecurity, you can overcome it. 

similar to an eating disorder i would say (my personal experience). i know i will not feel better thinner, yet i keep convincing myself i will, so i invest all this time and effort into losing weight, just for nothing to change. i’m still this extremely insecure person. 

you will find that your happiness and security does not come from you looks.  looking good is just something you have convinced yourself will make you feel better. you need to find out where that source of unhappiness and insecurity is really coming from. i am working very hard to find that source, and every time i discover another reason why i feel this way, it teaches me a lot about myself and ways i can start feeling better."

therapy,fqtj47c,t3_gkqgyl,1589640014.0,"i used to be you. i used to stress when it was messy, i felt like my brain was fogging up, it disrupted my sleep and just made me feel sad and demotivated to see everything so disorganised. i would clean me room completely one day, and the next day it would look like exactly like it was before- a mess. i can’t tell you exactly what changed, but now, my room is always extremely neat. 

if i were to pin point one thing that helped, it was committing to always making my bed in the morning. i always hated having lots of stuff piled up on my bed, like clothes and school work etc. i made a promise to myself that i would stop dumping stuff on my bed, and always make it best and tidy first thing on the morning.

eventually, this desire to keep things orderly spread to the rest of my room, and now, my room is always tidy and i’m so much happier as a result. granted, i do have to commit to putting things back to where they should be every 2 days just to keep on top of everything.

basically, the things you should try are making you bed in the morning, every morning; decluttering everything you don’t want; and listening to music while you clean (let’s face it, it’s not an exciting job).

i strongly suggest you have a serious, sit down conversation with your parents. tell them how you are feeling and why you think therapy will help. if this is too daunting i suggest you write everything down and allow them to read it- it will also prevent you from being interrupted. 

you will most likely find that they will be more open to the idea that you originally imagine.

fuckeatingdisorders,fmvifc5,t3_fxf8ft,1586418112.0,"i am feeling the exact same way, my parents are always criticising my overweight brother for eating more than his fair share and i make a bad habit of internalising their criticism of him and projecting it onto myself. i feel that by eating anything i am wasting food and will be told off for it (even thought that’s not true). they are always complaining about how supermarkets are really under-stocked and it makes me want to starve even more because whenever food is used now, it’s so much more obvious."
getdisciplined,fmq5q66,t3_fwksm3,1586293359.0,"if you don’t have a reason to get up early, you never will. it’s not enough just to want to. you have to have a clear goal in your head, you need to know exactly what you are going to do with that extra time. are you going to do chores? get some exercise? start that exciting project you’ve been thinking about? what i like to do is write down what i am planning to do in the morning and place it on my bedside table so i see it the moment my alarm goes off, i’m instantly reminded of what i have to do and i cant just go back to bed in a sleepy fog like usual."
fuckeatingdisorders,fmcjvs6,t3_fuf1cp,1585947084.0,"remember that this feeling will pass, trust me, i know just how it feels and would be hypocritical of me to say it’s easy because i let those thoughts overwhelm me a lot. popcorn will do nothing to change your body, what you are feeling is the sensation of food physically being inside your stomach, you’re not gaining weight. recovery is meant to make you uncomfortable, that’s how you know you’re doing it right."
therapy,fmb0w53,t3_fu67v2,1585915069.0,"i am so sorry you have been bullied. your worth is not connected to your weight, even though it feels like that now. you are still worthy of love and respect no matter what you look like, always remember that. secondly, as someone who really struggles with opening up to people, i know how difficult it is to talk about what you’re feeling, but only by talking can you actually resolve your issues, whether they be physical or mental."
TalkTherapy,fm9jtjf,t3_ftsxd6,1585870195.0,"i think that is a great way of prioritising your session so you get the most out of it. if you don’t think it’s the right move though, try going in without it and discuss what comes naturally, after that you will really know if the list is worth it."
TalkTherapy,fm8of58,t3_ftceyl,1585853059.0,"first off, i’m so sorry about this, i can’t imagine the grief you are experiencing. 
perhaps your aversion to their soft language is linked to how you are coping with the grief, you should definitely discuss your language pretefences"
therapy,fm8nrna,t3_fth3fi,1585852724.0,"therapy is completely confidential, they can’t know what you’re talking about and they cannot dictate to you what you say, fuck them."
fuckeatingdisorders,fm8jkoq,t3_ftdtk3,1585850544.0,"that would has destroyed me. a big problem of mine is i can’t let things go, i hold onto every passing comment, things said about me 8/9 years ago i still use as fuel on the ED fire."
fuckeatingdisorders,fltr517,t3_fr1286,1585484444.0,"definitely hospital, you’re past the point of doing this on your own."
EatingDisorders,fllsc5j,t3_fpltix,1585266737.0,"being very insecure and skipping multiple meals a day sounds like an ED. just because she is not shy about it does not mean she is lying. it’s not your place to judge whether her pain is real or not, she knows her situation better than you. you just need to talk to her."
TalkTherapy,fljkpf0,t3_fp8gun,1585216758.0,"the belief that i didn’t deserve it or that my eating disorder was not that bad. as with many people with EDs, there was also an element of wanting to carry on getting worse. eventually i had a breakdown and had therapy prescribed to me by someone else."
therapy,fljkkqv,t3_fp224b,1585216597.0,"if you cannot physically say these things to your therapist, you should write them down and give it to them as a letter. you will almost definitely find talking about your thoughts around sex and violence beneficial."
fuckeatingdisorders,fld9me8,t3_fnu70c,1585059854.0,"recovery is for anyone looking to heal distressing thoughts or habits. a good diet is good for everyone, no matter their weight. if you think taking to someone, or having specialists give you advice on how to proceed both mentally and physically, you should absolutely look into recovery."
fuckeatingdisorders,fld9a43,t3_fnvk6d,1585059631.0,"remember you’re not alone, food shortages and quarantine are hitting a lot of people with EDs and anxiety really hard. it’s affecting me too, i don’t want to eat because i’m afraid i’m eating too much and the rest of my family are missing out, even though, logically, i know that is not the case. i would suggest journaling your thoughts and anxieties, it helps you understand your feelings and start to work towards solutions. that’s especially useful when you have no one else to turn to."
fuckeatingdisorders,fld8vqb,t3_fnyubz,1585059367.0,"you already know you have an ED. getting help when you are ready is vital, you don’t have to wait till you think you’re ‘sick enough’ because that day will never come. as long as you are sick you will always want to lose more, and that gets dangerous very quickly... living at peace with food is possible with help. you won’t feel this way about food forever as long as you get help."
fuckeatingdisorders,flcta36,t3_fnxbwv,1585045623.0,i was literally just about to write about this. i don’t binge but eating anything makes me feel even more guilty because i feel like i am using us resources that other people need. i now make an effort to eat even less than i did already.
therapy,fla0e2u,t3_fn1wbz,1584973813.0,have you considered asking her that? it sounds like she is struggling to cope.
fuckeatingdisorders,fl9i6f7,t3_fne9f2,1584956866.0,i feel the exact same way. i can’t offer any advice but you’re definitely not alone...
fuckeatingdisorders,fl9i36g,t3_fnam5n,1584956745.0,i began exercising very early into recovery because exercise was never a part of my ED. i began exercising because i enjoy it and while i was restricting i never had any energy to do it.
TalkTherapy,fl57xbh,t3_fmc1lj,1584830534.0,"i will have my first over the phone therapy session on monday, i am not looking forward to it at all, i rely on being able to see my therapist face to face because i am a very paranoid person. i have decided to try it at least once before i rule it out though, because the only alternative in no therapy for the foreseeable future..."
fuckeatingdisorders,fl20zro,t3_fljd74,1584740522.0,"i think there is an element of wanting to prove to others how sick you are. we live in a society where people who are thin are praised for their self-control, getting worse proves how much ‘control’ you have even though in reality, we have no control."
fuckeatingdisorders,fksb9jf,t3_fk9bod,1584486228.0,"wow, what kind of friend would disregard your triggers like that?? if i were you, i would block them next time they sends you one. warn them, then when they do, send them a message and block them for a few days so they knows you are serious. there is nothing wrong with standing up for yourself, especially when it’s your health and well-being that is in danger."
therapy,fksb25t,t3_fk96ku,1584486097.0,"my therapist is still doing physical sessions, she comes into my school every monday (i’m 18). that’s the only reason i don’t want schools to shut down."
TalkTherapy,fkq5ghh,t3_fjzjhe,1584431337.0,it’s not for everyone but i do sometimes like it when my mum takes an interest in my therapy sessions. i don’t tell her a lot of specifics but it’s nice to talk to someone about what i’ve learned about myself and the reasons for my problems. make sure you take an interest in her progress but don’t push for information if she doesn’t want to share because therapy is very very personal.
