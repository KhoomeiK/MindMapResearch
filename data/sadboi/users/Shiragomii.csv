vikingstv,fh96ln9,t1_fh7w112,1581374301.0,No one is untouchable. It doesn't mean that the events that transpired were well done though. And if you read what i said i said obviously it COULD happen. But the chances of that going down the way it did was too perfect. That is all
vikingstv,fh7unq3,t1_fh7lc6s,1581345175.0,"So fair enough that yeah it COULD happen. But bjorn is no regular dude in battle which we have seen. He is a monster. And for him to be unaware that danger was that near when like a scene before that he was spinning around and swatting down dudes who were also actively trying to kill him, im like ok, cool, so the only dude who had to cripple his way to him stabbed him when basically no one else touched him before? Alright. Also if that was ivar who stabbed him, did he not get attacked on the way to bjorn? Like sure they were overwhelmed in numbers BUT there were other vikings still fighting before they got killed that had to be on the way to where bjorn was. Idk, i mean obviously he is still alive for now. Just seemed unrealistic that he would have fallen that way. Dude who killed a bear when he was way younger. Again, not saying its completely impossible to get caught off guard. Just that for Bjorn it seems much less likely. AND less likely that he wouldn't be aware of his brother, who he hates, running(or hobbling) up on him to stab him. The window of opportunity for ivar to do that without him knowing and going through other people seemed really annoying."
