Meditation,fm07oco,t3_frt7ul,1585647965.0,"Try the opposite. Look upstream. At first the river is silent, but then a torrent erupts. Even the worst thoughts tumble towards you. Let them go through you. You're not the thoughts. You're not the river. Because the river is only a 'place'. Where water molecules pass through in different locations and arrangements.

And those molecules are mostly empty space. And yet the river still brings life to the banks and the fields. How can a single molecule of water be 'bad'? A river is just a collection of molecules of water flowing near eachother. You are just a collection of molecules near each other. Be like water. Let it flow through that place, and it's not a defined location even, that is you.

To love and be rejected causes pain. Because we have evolved to seek belonging and acceptance. For survival. What do you do with that pain? It is like being a rock in the river. It is a place where water does not flow.

Two options, be the rock. Feel its solidity. What's wrong with being a rock? Maybe you need that stillness. The water will still flow. Ultimately it doesn't matter. You're the space between the stone.

Or move the rock out of the way. Either option is just moving molecules around, and that flexibility can move mountains or even the mind.

What if the river dries up? That water went somewhere. It's still wet. There is still the quality of wetness.

What if there were no water? There would be stone. There would be gas. There would be space. At the end there is always space. Even when there is no space, there is energy that can never be created nor destroyed.

What was there before there was energy. Well, there was no before because there was no time. Just timeless energy.

What would the world be without energy? There would be no world. And there would be no awareness of it. There would be nothing.

Even nothing would not be bad. There would be no bad and no one to mark it so.

But there is some thing. So let if flow through you.

These are all just words. But words can change how we feel. We are children playing games with energy. Don't forget to laugh. Childhood is full of joy and wonder.

Childhood can also be full of fear and sadness. Children grow up. So do you. One day you will not be.

The river keeps flowing. Right now, you are in the river. Feel wet.

Or be enveloped by the river but remain dry. Dry or wet, the river still flows.

The universe doesn't care how you feel. The universe is something you are made of. You are the river and the stone and the person in the river and the mind playing games with energy.

You can be all of those things, you can be happy, and you can be at peace. You can be angry and you can be in pain.

You can be dry and you can be wet and you can be the river and you can be the space between the molecules and you can be timeless energy and you can be nothing."

If you can't control things anymore, go directly to an ER or call 911.  Inpatient hospitalization is far better than a serious attempt at self-harm.  You shouldn't be waiting even days to see a psychiatrist.  You son needs attention and monitoring while trying new meds and restraining dangerous behavior.

I think Abilify was the wrong antipsychotic to prescribe.  It can be the most 'activating' antipsychotic, because whereas most antipsychotics block dopamine receptors (full antagonists), Abilify partially stimulates them (partial agonist).

Your son NEEDS to be on an antipsychotic and you have other options that vary in how 'heavy' they are:

1. 2nd generation antipsychotics - Risperidone, Olanzapine, Quetiapine work differently than Abilify. They're not 'partial agonists' (partial dopamine receptor stimulants). They are full 'antagonists' (dopamine receptor blockers).
2. 1st generation antipsychotics - Haldol is a full dopamine blocker and is very sedating. It can have more side effects than 2nd gen antipsychotics.
3. Nuclear option - clozapine is the biggest gun in the antipsychotic arsenal (but you may need it). It has the most side effects.

In addition to antipsychotics, now could be the time for straight anti-anxiety medications like Xanax or Valium (benzodiazepines). If your son is agitated, these will help calm him in the short term (though they won't treat the underlying psychosis or suicidality and they can be addictive).

Many Warren supporters are women who are just sick of being sidelined in the biggest political battles.  This is confirmed by Warren's invisibility in the media the last 2 months.  It takes more than 'respect' to make a Warren supporter feel validated; it takes an active and explicit recognition that she's suffered from sexism.

politics,fjenosy,t3_fd2eyx,1583275085.0,"After much thinking... I've decided to vote for BERNIE.

Here's why...

===  
WARREN  
===

Warren is a fierce, smart, incredibly prepared, action-oriented pragmatist with detailed and specific plans. She has demonstrated capacity to reform financial systems and knows how to get things done in government. She brings a strong focus on inequality and against corruption, and she supports highly-regulated capitalism along with a Wealth Tax.

Warren would be the first woman president, endorsed by Emily's List and the National Organization for Women. She's undoubtedly been a victim of sexism and rendered largely invisible by media and pundits, though she is actually many candidate's second choice (a ""hidden champion""). If ranked choice voting existed, she could be a frontrunner.

It's way too early to count her out with so few delegates actually awarded and campaign narratives changing overnight. Warren has lots of money and a very strong national organizing game. Since no candidate is likely to win a majority of pledged delegates, voting for her as the best candidate is still prudent. She is a grounded midwesterner with a strong work ethic and middle-class upbringing.

\---On the other hand---

Warren is among the very lowest-polling remaining Democrats and has performed very poorly in the first four primaries. Her many plans have failed to articulate a compelling, accessible vision. She's not backed by a Movement and doesn't have broad minority or low-income voter support. She's most popular with white, college-educated voters (especially women), who do not represent the full range or future of the Democratic party. She's also not particularly popular with young voters.

Warren has very little chances of winning a majority of delegates, so she actually wants a brokered convention. But a brokered convention is unlikely to result in her getting the nomination, so she ends up splitting the progressive vote. Yet she's still too divisive and extreme for moderates and centrists. And, she does worse than Bernie or Biden in head-to-head polls against Trump.

Despite their policy alignment, Warren has criticized Bernie during the campaign, reducing her ability to unify the left wing of the party. She switched her stance against taking Super PAC funding and is now getting large 'dark money' donations from who-knows-where. She used to be a member of the conservative Federalist Society and was a high-paid corporate consultant and lawyer (before becoming a teacher and capitalist reformer).

===  
BERNIE  
===

Bernie is a passionate, anti-establishment Democratic Socialist, a New Deal Democrat who is a moral leader that has pulled the entire Democratic party to the left. He is the clear front-runner in the polls and leader in pledged delegates after the first four primaries. Bernie is the strongest critic of social and financial inequality and has built a huge, energized movement behind him around Medicare For All and other progressive policies.

Bernie is a charismatic, fully grass-roots funded populist. He is backed by the largest and most diverse progressive coalition, endorsed by Democracy for Action and Green New Deal stars like AOC. He would be the first Jewish President (while ardently supporting Palestinian rights).

Though an old white man, Bernie has shown 'intersectional' support from minority, people of color, and low-income voters. Bernie has tons of small-donor funds and has taken zero money from Super PACs. He has the highest favorability ratings of any candidate, along with name recognition and political celebrity power. Polls show him as the most electable progressive, and able to beat trump head-to-head.

Bernie has been a consistent social justice advocate for decades, an in-the-trenches civil rights activist, and a lifelong fighter for equality. Despite criticism of being an ""ideologue"", Bernie has sponsored important and even bipartisan pieces of legislation that were passed into law.

Despite their competition, Bernie hasn't criticized Warren (though his supporters have). Bernie's loss of the Democratic nomination despite having a plurality of votes and delegates could destroy the Democratic party and its future. Though the most likely outcome is a damaging contested convention, Bernie is most likely to avoid one. He could bring in independents and some typical non-voters; even some disaffected Trump-voting populists are attracted to him. Despite being ""far-left"" Bernie should still get the ""Anyone But Trump"" votes, at the very least as the lesser of two evils--and Bernie is far from evil. He could unite progressive in the party, and the rest of the party (begrudgingly) behind him.

\---On the other hand---

Bernie could turn off moderate democrats and centrists who would otherwise vote against Trump. He is terrifying to both conservatives and centrists and could keep moderate republicans from voting for a Democrat. His radicalism could hurt house and senate races in moderate states which are equally important in this election.

Bernie struggles to clearly explain how he could pay for his big ideas and could ultimately end up raising taxes on the middle class. His path to beating Trump depends on turning out youth voters, the least reliable voting block. Bernie has often voted ideologically and been a lone dissenter rather than a pragmatist or team-player. He has also been against gun regulations for decades, which may further alienate some parts of the Democratic base.

If Bernie gets a plurality but not a majority of delegates, and loses a brokered convention, it could split the Democratic party in two, or destroy it for the future (though some people think that's necessary). This could hurt the electability of the final Democratic nominee against Trump.

Bernie has aggressive online supporters and is surrounded by obnoxious ""Bernie Bros"" (though some of them are bots or trolls). As a populist, Bernie is more radicalizing and even draws stylistic comparisons to Trump. He will be smeared as a ""Socialist"" (which he calls himself), and Russia has publicly supported him (at least to foment chaos and division). Throughout history he has made supportive comments of authoritarian Communist leaders. Last, Bernie, though healthy and energetic, had a recent heart attack.

===  
CONCLUSION  
===  
When I weigh it all, though my personal preference from the beginning was for Warren as president, there is abundant reason now to vote for BERNIE, in order to advance progressive policies, to win the Democratic primary, and to defeat Trump come November.

Whatever your own conclusion, VOTE!"

1. As in any tragedy, your highest priority is to take care of yourself. Sometimes that happens after taking care of others. It has to happen at some point.
2. Proximity to tragedy is trauma. There is no such thing as an unaffected witness.
3. Our duty in retelling the stories of others pain is to honor their integrity, dignity, and memory.
4. Effects of trauma can appear days, weeks, months, or even years later. We are first adrenaline-ridden heroes or survivors. When that armor fades, we feel vulnerability with new and sometimes crushing intensity.
5. If you are starting to react to everyday life events like they are loaded, threatening, offensive, or foreboding, it is completely natural. It is also a sign that you need to talk to someone about what happened.
6. Recovery is for the future. We don’t examine trauma to solve or cure it, but to make sure that it doesn’t derail our own journey towards a meaningful life.
7. When you are weak, lean on the people around you. Literally, go rest your body on someone’s chest or shoulder. Just lie there. It’s ok.
8. If you can’t open to others and you find yourself seeking isolation, then take isolation in self-care. While your mind processes, give your body rest and nourishment.
9. When you are ready, understanding will come. This is not an answer to question, but a vision for what comes next and a willingness to accept it.
10. Recovery is work. Even when a trauma is outside of our control, the task of cleaning wounds falls into our hands. Like much work, it can not only heal but also make you strong. It’s ok to become stronger. Sometimes it’s the only way."
