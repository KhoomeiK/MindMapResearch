BodyAcceptance,fq6hga5,t1_fq5l3up,1589131597.0,"And? If that‚Äôs what helps her feel confident why do we need to shame it? Furthermore, what does appearance have anything to do with being successful? I feel bad if you walk around judging people‚Äôs abilities off of what they look like. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre beautiful and successful, let‚Äôs support women"
AdultChildren,fq2tisv,t3_ggnbpw,1589059511.0,"Hi babe. I‚Äôm in a very similar circumstance. Fortunately I don‚Äôt live with my alcoholic mother, but I‚Äôm home from college and with my dad and step mom. I also have an apartment near campus.

Even though my relationship with my dad and step mom is good, I‚Äôm considering going back to my apartment just to get a break. The point is, quarantine can be taxing on everyone in these circumstances. It is not easy moving back in with your parents as an adult. These are really weird times, and we all need to take a break.

I know it feels scary and lonely right now, but you have to know that quarantine is NOT going to last forever. It will end and you WILL get through this. 

I understand it can feel easy to go back to an environment that is familiar, but you deserve and are worthy of setting boundaries. You are a grown adult, and whether your parents realize it or not, you have needs. The sneaking around and hiding is NOT normal. You should feel safe in your home, and right now you don‚Äôt. Take some time to process that.

If you go back, it‚Äôs likely this will happen again. Even though your dad says he‚Äôs going to get better, you still deserve to say no, I‚Äôm not going to let you mistreat me right now. I‚Äôm going to stand up for myself. Additionally, if you go back, there‚Äôs no knowing to what extent he will threaten you if you keep coming back. 

Ultimately the decision to go or stay is up to you. Personally, I would stay at your apartment for a bit. It will get easier. There are tons of people isolating along right now, so you aren‚Äôt alone. We are all in the same boat. There might be some communities on here that are platforms for ppl to talk about their isolation? Take walks once a day if you can. Spend time on something you‚Äôve been wanting to do. Practice self care!

You can love your mom and dad, but love yourself more right now. What is best for YOU right now? We love you and are here for you! You deserve better üíó"
confidence,fpx8a89,t3_gfx4c8,1588977587.0,"porn, swearing, graffiti don't make people inherently bad. that's a self-imposed standard, and honestly sounds like a problematic excuse. reframe your perspective. it's all about intention. think about someone in your life that is good, what do they do?"
BodyAcceptance,fpl7p7n,t1_fpjrfn4,1588707836.0,Exactly! I say keep doing you. Well behaved women rarely make history.
BodyAcceptance,fpis5yy,t3_gdal8a,1588647506.0,"Girl as long as it makes YOU happy, FUCK what other people say. If you find it empowering, life your best life.

Get those lip fillers, get those hair extensions, etc. because that‚Äôs YOU. that is what makes you feel best and most empowered.

Our society tells us so much about what we should and shouldn‚Äôt look like. I also love that men LOVE to sexualize women, but the second a woman embraces her sexuality in any capacity, she‚Äôs a slut. Fuck that shit.

You know you‚Äôre hot shit, you know you look and feel good for yourself, so let that confidence exude from within and keep doing YOU. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you that you don‚Äôt look ‚Äúsuitable‚Äù enough for them."
Anxiety,fpi2nb9,t3_gdfeum,1588632457.0,Babe I get botox for migraines too. And I have anxiety hehe. But I promise you the botox isn‚Äôt going to hurt you and you‚Äôre going to be okay. I‚Äôve been getting it for over a year!
migraine,fp0gdcr,t3_gakwfc,1588208733.0,"Honestly my doctor does the same. I find it to be incredibly painful, worse than any tattoo or piercing. I usually will ask to take a break in the middle because it‚Äôs so painful. He doesn‚Äôt intentionally try to do it super harsh, but it‚Äôs a lot of shots to give and even then, it still takes around 15 minutes. Your doctor might be seeing multiple patients at once, so they might not have time to go super super slow. But speak up! Ask to take a break or lay down for a minute if it gets too painful.

It‚Äôs also pretty normal to bleed quite a bit. I‚Äôm not on blood thinners but usually one or two of the injection spots will bleed more than the others.

Good luck!"

Anxiety,fogujfy,t1_fogl8k3,1587757131.0,Love I promise you it‚Äôs just anxiety. I literally have a dull ache in my chest and ‚Äúshortness of breath‚Äù ALL THE TIME. even when I‚Äôm not having a panic attack.

migraine,fockq6f,t1_fobhi93,1587672481.0,during this quarantine I've been waking up at 3/4/5 p.m. ! we're all in a similar boat! it's totally normal and okay to take care of yourself through rest. sleeping in that late is just a sign that your body needs rest <3
migraine,fock7g3,t1_foadhs1,1587672299.0,"Usually on the day of injection I will get a bad migraine, but it typically subsides after one or two days. But pretty much everytime I get injections my head hurts after."
