AskWomen,flr1j3u,t3_fhfbti,1585411010.0,"My bf and I live in different states (we're very close to the state borders though, about 45 minutes apart) and his state just declared a stay at home order until the end of April!! I'm upset mostly because we're still newly together (2 months) and we spent a lot of time together because we love being around each other. My state or county isn't under a quarantine and I work from home currently because I work in the state he lives in. We text often but sometimes he's a bad texter where some hours will go by before he texts back, and we play online games together with voice chat but it's only for a few hours before he wants to go play with his friends. We tried Netflix party last night, and while it was cool, it made me miss cuddling up on the couch with him. I try to keep myself occupied by doing chores around the apartment, watching my shows, or playing games but I miss that physical interaction with him because we're physically affectionate people. I'm just not sure how I'm going to survive a month, maybe even longer, without seeing him. I'm dealing with anxious attachment so being apart like this is really putting me in a huge depression. I'm so selfish that I want him to come see me regardless of the quarantine but I also don't want him to get fined or sent to jail for breaking it. How the heck can I deal with this? Is anyone else in the same boat?"

unpopularopinion,fjkf9a5,t3_fczy7d,1583425811.0,"It's so weird that I would come across this after management made some changes to our department. We were generally allowed to surf the web or play on our phones/listen to music in between work, but now they're restricting that from us. I'm one of the top performers on the team because I come in, do my work well, and go home without causing a fuss. Playing a game on my phone or browsing Facebook/Reddit in between work keeps me sane. My previous jobs were all the same too; no phones unless you're on break and no going on ""fun"" websites or social media. I love the company I work for, but I hate this small thing. Sure we have an hour long lunch, but we're only allowed 2 15 minute breaks. Not being able to decompress with a silly phone game or Reddit when not busy with work will itch me towards leaving and I don't want that."

I'm not financially responsible for kids right now nor even in the right headspace, but I most definitely want kids. My BF understands this and wants to wait as well and my parents aren't rushing me either because they know it's a big responsibility. I used to be friends with a girl from high school who had a kid at 17 (followed by 3 more kids after that...) and she struggled to do things like get a degree, work, and take care of her kid(s). She complained all the time about having no time to do anything or having no money to do things she wanted to do, like girl you did that to yourself."

When my current BF and I were just dating and not official yet, we spent a night going through Tinder and OKC and criticizing the different profiles and likes we got. My BF couldn't believe the amount of likes I had (over 1k) while he only had about 30. I tell him how lucky he is that out of 1k dudes that liked me, he's the one I swiped right on lol. We've both been single for about 3-ish years; I was on dating app since October 2019 but he's been on them for longer. I'm really lucky and really glad he didn't give up on them after all that time or we'd have never found each other."
AskWomen,fj4uvws,t3_fbcoqp,1583017452.0,Spent close to $600 on a weight loss kit which contained a ton of different pills to take at different times of the day and protein powder. Sure I lost 45lbs but I'm convinced it had nothing to do with the pills but because I was eating very little calories. It was a strict plan where you just had to eat high protein meals in small portions. I guess on the plus side it helped me understand how calorie counting works and I'm a bit more health conscious now.

Everything just felt SO right. We made things official after the 5th date (at that point we had been talking through text for over a month and were going out once a week), didn't kiss until a few days after that and slept together that weekend. Week and a half later we exchanged I Love Yous. He tells me that things just feel so right and he's sure that I am the only one he wants to be with, saying he can't wait to wife me up and have tons of kids with me lol. Some would say we move way too fast, but honestly we're just doing what feels good. Only thing is he's being very cautious on moving in together, which I totally understand. I've lived with someone I dated before. He hasn't so it's still very new to him. He's worried about messing things up so would rather take things slow in that regard. Still, best guy I've ever dated and hopefully the last one <3"

He asked me beforehand if it was okay to leave stuff like that at my place because he, too, thought it was annoying to keep bringing stuff over. He wants to buy extra t-shirts and jeans to keep at my place because he still ends up bringing all that over, but at least it's better than constantly packing and unpacking toiletries. My BF bought travel size things to leave behind since they're dirt cheap and don't take up too much room, so you can always do that."

I get you're trying to be nice or show interest (which is already obvious if you liked my profile), but that makes me feel like you want more than that or don't care about anything else I got going on. My current bf that I did meet through one of the apps didn't say anything about my looks until the 4th or 5th date? But by that point I was totally into him so the compliments were welcoming and not creepy at all. He didn't start up with the pet names until about a week after we made it official; that'd also be too creepy to me if it was way early on. I usually don't care for them, but he makes them sound good lol."

AskWomen,fg1dwxf,t3_ew9e7i,1580425377.0,"My last relationship we fought constantly because he'd rather chat and play games with a girl online who lived in a different country than spend time with me. I'm cool with you having other friends, but he would spend the minute he got home from work online playing games with her until after midnight. Only time he wanted to spend with me was when I made him dinner. He stopped being affectionate, only wanted sex when he wasn't preoccupied. I even asked to play with him and he always made up excuses. It was such a tiring relationship and I started resenting him for it, but was too proud to leave him because I'm a hopeless romantic and believed we would work out. But it was a doomed relationship the minute he told me he didn't want to get married (I do), and yet I stayed thinking he would change his mind. We lasted 2.5 years. He dumped me in mid-2017, I moved away and later found out he got together with someone else about a month after we split. So they were talking and getting close when me and him were still together.

Cut to now, I recently went exclusive with a guy I've been dating. We matched on a dating app last month and I never thought it would work out. He's truly a breath of fresh air. We're similar in so many ways, and he's so willing to play games with me and do whatever else. I had major anxiety about the relationship, but after I opened up to him about my anxiety, he's been very supportive and understanding. I have an issue with being clingy, and instead of trying to push me away, he wants me to be as clingy as I want with him because he loves the affection. We haven't been together long but I really want to believe he's my soulmate. He's so easy to talk to and I have zero worries at all about how he feels about me. I'm hoping he's my forever."

The cushions don't come off either. It's so baffling. I know under the couch was her go to hiding spot. I tried shaking a treat bag but no go :(
cats,fb2llwz,t1_fb2ia4o,1576453281.0,"Dresser is closed off underneath and behind, checked all the drawers :("
cats,fb2lk41,t1_fb2ijog,1576453255.0,"Oh yes. Checked every single cabinet in the kitchen and bathroom, as well as dresser drawers too. It's not opened up on the bottom of the dresser so she couldn't have snuck up there"
cats,fb2lc15,t1_fb2j43i,1576453138.0,"Yeah I'm keeping the stuff where it is now, especially since she used the litter box. My parents came over for dinner but are leaving soon, and I'll be by myself during the week. I plan to just chill quietly tonight and pray she comes out, even after I go to sleep."
NinjaSexParty,fauor9s,t3_eam7x6,1576350424.0,This really goes to show how much more amazing they've gotten over the past 10 years! And I will be very sad if they get rid of the Danny doll 😂

playstation,faf1ty1,t1_faeeh0a,1576012756.0,"It took about a week to 100% the main game when I got it around release, maybe close to two weeks but only time I really played a ton was on the weekends. Each DLC takes about maybe about 2-3 hours to 100%, or longer depending on how long you spend on the Screwball challenges (spoiler alert: they suck lol)."
IdiotsInCars,fadxri7,t3_e8ldw9,1575989073.0,I encountered an idiot who pulled the same shit the other day with going into a right-only lane and merging into the straight lane once the light changed. And a different idiot on a different day who stopped traffic in the straight lane because he wanted to get into the left turn lane. Why is it so difficult to commit to your mistake and find a different route?
PS4Deals,fadj4w0,t3_e8ifkz,1575974361.0,The Target near me had it for $2.98! But I'm way too late because they're all sold out.
playstation,fadj1i7,t3_e8ia6o,1575974217.0,Me but other PS4 exclusives because I already played through Spider-Man 100% 😂

IdiotsInCars,f9ufeu1,t3_e6pvui,1575649783.0,"This morning around 6:15am there was a train that was about to pass through. I watched several cars panic because they were stopped on the tracks, probably stupidly thinking that there'd be no way a train would come through this early. People inching up closer to the car in front of them and people doing the reverse of shame. It was very amusing to watch."

relationships,f94enn9,t3_e3j8vn,1575085852.0,"Ugh this was definitely me dealing with my ex. He always got McDonald's so there'd be McDonald's bags and cups sitting around by his computer along with glasses and plates from when I made dinner that night. I nagged him constantly about cleaning up but it never got through to him. Basically I was doing everything except his laundry, even cooking. His clothes were always laying around somewhere in the bedroom and sometimes in the living room. I grew to resent him overtime because it was getting unbearable and it just led me to be this bitter person towards him up until he ended things, even though it should've been me to end things because I was convincing myself too hard that we could make it work (it was already doomed when he told me he never wanted to get married, which is something I do want but I was so convinced that I could change his mind in due time). Unless you don't mind doing most if not all of the cleaning, it might be better just to split to save the heartache. :/"
IdiotsInCars,f92x8jp,t1_f91dzlp,1575044252.0,I wave at people who pass me too lmao especially someone who was tailgating me for miles on a 2-lane road that finally had an opportunity to pass.
cats,f8q0lva,t1_f8pmd4i,1574710251.0,"It breaks my heart that people overlook adult cats! I love kittens as much as the next cat lover, but they're a handful and I could never leave one by itself during the day. The last kitty I saw that I didn't get a chance to spend time with will be my next visit. They have notes up at each cage about the cat, most saying ""really sweet!"" ""kind kitty!"", etc but that all could vary until I experience them first hand. And thank you :)"
cats,f8q0a1i,t1_f8pgphw,1574710102.0,"Aww that's awesome! That got me thinking too that this shelter isn't the only one in the area, and that I could check out a different one to see if there's another cat that pops out at me even though I wish I could adopt them all haha. I'm really thinking about this last cat I saw though so I'll definitely pay her a visit tomorrow and if the spark isn't there, I have another place in mind I could check out :)"
cats,f8pzh4l,t1_f8pe3xp,1574709744.0,"It feels overwhelming too because I can only afford to adopt one cat at this time, but there's a few that catch my eye and makes me wish I could adopt them all, you know? They're used to the volunteers there, too, whereas I'm some rando off the street with a totally different scent so I can understand their wariness."
cats,f8pz2ma,t1_f8pdx50,1574709559.0,I like that thought process. I'll definitely take that into consideration next time I go. I figured it had to do with me being a stranger to them compared to the volunteers they see every day. I think I'm just used to my parents' cats that I grew up with for 12-13 years so I need to get out of that mindset.
PS4Deals,f8eejoe,t1_f8dcmim,1574526023.0,"Nice! I picked up EA Access on PS4 and have been playing Sims 4 for the past 2 hours. Controls are a bit tough to get used to because I'm used to playing Sims games on PC, but so far it's pretty fun. And it's so much more polished than Sims 3 was."
PS4Deals,f8d2jlv,t1_f8csb0d,1574476370.0,"Same haha. Ended up getting EA Access to download Unravel and Sims 4, and got Batman Enemy Within season pass on top of the other 40 games I have yet to play.. good times lol."
PS4Deals,f8cnorl,t1_f8c7m0p,1574464422.0,Physical is even better at that price. I completely 100%'d it on xbox 360 years ago but I'm getting the itch to pick it up again so I can play it for 3 days and then get bored
PS4Deals,f8c6uzo,t3_e04eoy,1574453817.0,"Is this the day I finally buy Skyrim?? $16 is the lowest it's ever been, but a part of me still wants to hold out hope it'll drop down to $10.

On the other hand, is Sim 4 any good? $10 is a really good deal unless it could drop lower. But I heard getting it on the EA Access (whenever that happens) would be better."
