I’m gonna be honest man, I was on the fence for a long time about believing. None of this makes sense even from the perspective of a witness if you dig into your own history and see how often you’ve changed your doctrine. Doomsday theories and pyramids. Telling stories about demons in yearbooks, which you’re not supposed to do anymore. No beards. Babylon being destroyed in the wrong year according to you guys. It doesn’t even make sense biblically. It only makes sense biblically the way YOUVE been taught the Bible. Not the way everyone else has been taught. You aren’t the only religion that worships YHWH.
