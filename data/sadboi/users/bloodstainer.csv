pokemon,fnffbcz,t1_fnbnt8j,1586906957.0,">The first two gens were so limited in terms of color.

Well, at least the first gen was. Every mon only had 1 color scale due to being backwards compatible with the pre-color gameboy. So they could work with greyscales. So they had white and black (white were just backgorund color and black was no color) and this was improved in second gen made for the gameboy color so mons could have multiple colors like tentacool's spots were now red etc. So I wouldn't say the second gen was limited by color so much as it was size of the sprites.

I honestly wish Nintendo remade some of the sprites better especially Jynx. Check out the original japanese shiny sprite and original sprite for jynx. They removed the black and replaced with purple for her face, which makes sense due to the racist allegations. But to do this they had to cut away the color of her hair so her shiny sprite having silver hair made no sense whatsoever, but when she originally had black face and yellow hair it did. I wish they could just keep her hair yellow and her face purple for the VC, it can be done (since they did do exactly this for Pokemon Yellow on virtual console) and jynx is probably one of the main reason why red/blue on VC are greyscale instead of the colored versions. This change also makes it so that in pokemon yellow on VC, every single pokemon only use a single color palette, except Jynx which gets both the Red color palette (you can make yellow on both green and red color palettes) and the purple is probably done through blue.  


edit: but some of gen 1's sprites are amazing considering they only had 1 palette each. I mean take a look at the depths of Arbok's and dugtrio sprite, and Haunter lends itself great to being single-color palette. It's probably my all time favorite haunter sprite. And Chansey is so much better, like red/blue were horrendous in comparison to yellow's chansey."

Like, there really isn't a use case where you can't fit a GPU in a PC. The small form factor cases are smaller than shoe boxes, if you're that size-restrained it's no longer a fault of the components. My issue with small form factor is honestly the insane cost increase. And still, even for your case, more GPU power would help way more than more CPU cores. My argument wasn't that the 3400g wasn't a good CPU, I merely said it doens't make sense to make a 3600g with 6 cores and 12 threads with like a ""Vega 13"" but instead something like a 3500g with 4 cores and 8 threads and maybe a vega 14 would make more sense.

Pokemon game progression isn't a staircase where which and every step is calculated along a symmetrical line, it's much more random then that. And had we been able to transfer pokemon from gen 2 to 3, via trading, we most likely would have kept that trend and not gotten transfer system, and we wouldn't have gotten FRLG and the whole concept of remakes would have probably reached Nintendo sometime, but NOT as early as in the early 2000's we probably would've have gotten HG/SS either, A remake would've probably come much later down the line when they became streamlined in the rest of the media world. Pokemon was literally a good decade before the rest of the industry when it comes to remakes."
TruePokemon,fmkjgay,t1_fmkh56d,1586157039.0,">can you elaborate what you mean by 'fucky Johto starter mechanic'? I knew you could get them if you compete some variant of the Dex.

Yes, if you complete the national dex in emerald you get one starter.  


edit: sorry Hoenn dex, not national. But it's still a lot and you have to redo it three times, as well as it require to save when trading them, and it's not possible with Ruby and Sapphire. So you need to waste hours trading, resetting Emerald, trading back to emerald, getting second starter, trade all the mons over to FR/LG/S/R and restart emerald AGAIN. It's very tedious and annoying."
Amd,fmka0f7,t1_fdqldfd,1586148485.0,">The last 2 series APU's were low cost parts and i do not see how an 8core/16thread 65 watt APU part fits in that strategy. 

It doesn't even fit anyone's demand either. Everyone using APUs either want to save cash and get a good value low-end GPU with a decent mid-range CPU. There's no need for a low-end GPU paired with a high-core count CPU for almost nobody and if they do need that type of specific setup just pair a normal Ryzen 7 with a dedicated PCIe slot powered GPU instead.   


If anything needs to be improved with the 4200g and 4400g I wish it would be a bump in GPU performance, I'd actually love to see some decent GPU overclock headroom, like a 4400g pulling 85W and beating out the 3400G with a decent 15-18% jump"
Amd,fmk9kiz,t1_fdqcx55,1586148137.0,"No, they won't be 8C CPUs, we're going to get the same 4200g and 4400g. Take a look at how the CPU market have evolved, just a few years ago 4C/4T CPUs were the go-to gaming CPU and today it's a 6 core with SMT. We're not going to see 6core with SMT chips with a powerful iGPU, I think AMD is smart to keep as much of the die size and power going to the iGPU since the main reason to go AMD lower end is their powerful iGPU over Intels CPUs because their i3 and i5s don't make a lot of sense right now only reason to pick Intel as of this moment is if you don't have budget restraints and don't mind paying over 200 bucks for the motherboard and aim to go for really fast RAM just for the heck of it and go with their most expensive mainstream CPU, anything below that and you're better off going AMD, because if you DO have a budget for your PC, you should go with the best value at whichever pricepoint, and above $3000 for a gaming PC, that's not really much of a budget restraint unless we're talking monitor/Keyboard/mouse inclusion.   


My general advice for people building PCs for gaming are: If you are buying a 2080 Ti, you might want to get Intel. Anything below that GPU and you're throwing away money at the wrong bottleneck, or you're overpaying at a very low resolution. People need to stop treating anything from and above a 2060 Super like a 1080p card, it's not. The r9 290, 780 Ti and 970 are decent 1080p cards still to this day. If you're paying $400 or more for a GPU you shouldn't be paying a dime over $390 for CPU/mobo/memory combo unless you specifically wanna go for PCIe 4.0 PCIe SSDs. And at that price point, 1440p is doable and with the strides in gsync/freesync I recommend anyone who can go 1440p144hz to do it."

Your circuitry is built to be heated up and withstand the types of heat a poorly ventilated case situation they're often forced into, but quickly being cooled down is not something recommended and can cause a number of issues, this though is most likely not something you'll see in things not power hungry enough to actually build up some heat.

It just happened to be comething GameFreak decides to do instead of making a gen 2-3 trading system and it ended up becoming a popular thing within the franchise. People claiming that this is somewhat natural or something that would happen ""eventually"" is extremely narrow. And I think it's very much a thing because of our time is so colored by the fact that we get remakes all over from every single industry right now. This was not even common back in the early 2000's, back then literally everyone in the entertainment business came up with new and unique ideas, follow-ups were the hot take back then, not remakes. It would be interesting to show you how game's coverage talked about the upcoing FRLG back then, I might take a deep dive and try and find something."
TruePokemon,fmjw0gy,t1_fmj1yyn,1586138872.0,">I think we still would've gotten FRLG at some point, but during gen 3?

What makes you say that? The ENTIRE reason for it's creation would've been removed. They had two choices, make a remake or make a transfer system. Had we seen a transfer system it's very likely pokémon remakes would never have been a thing."
TruePokemon,fmjvul3,t1_fmijap1,1586138778.0,">I dunno if the transfer functionality would've affected FRLG.

Of course it would. The entire reason for FRLG's existence is the fact that you can't transfer old gen 1/2 mons. People wanted their Charizards and their Scizors. I image keep in mind you couldn't fucking get a Scyther in RSE. Imo, the only disadvantage of FRLG is that you can't easily glitch a Mew encounter that won't be bugged. Getting mew and a full dex in gen 1-2 is kinda easy. Other than that, gen 3 is such an amazing and coherent universe, the only disadvantages other then that would probably be the fucky johto starter mechanic."
TruePokemon,fmjv6fd,t3_fvfona,1586138401.0,"This is somewhat of a anachronistic way of viewing Pokémon. RBY were popular games, and GSC were VERY popular games. But the gameboy Advanced could play GBC games, it's just that so many things were added in gen 3 like natures, abilities, that transferring pokémon became a huge hassle. Since when talking about gen 1 to 2 conversions, we were still talking about pokemon as set data based for the GB system, sure there were excess data which later in gen 2 could signify held items etc (which is why if you trade over your pikachu from yellow, it holds a light ball, but if you trade it back to yellow, and then to another copy of a gen 2 game, it won't hold a light ball, despite gen 1 not having held item data) but how the GBA games stores pokemon data was completely redone and for the games to be able to trade (remember, transfer wasn't a thing yet at all) there would've have to be some form of communication from gen 2 to gen 3 data and it would have to reshuffle a lot of stats to make them compatible regarding things like how EVs were changed to a maximum of 255.

In the end, it was easier to just remake the gen 1 games, this exact reason is why we got FireRed/Leafgreen, and the only way we were got cucked was by the GameCube games which were the only reliable way of getting johto starters in gen 3. But yeah, GameFreak made a decision, do we waste development time so that people can keep their old ass 90's pokemon around, or make an additional game. Because remember, had they made trades possible, we most likely wouldn't have gotten FireRed and LeafGreen.  


And honestly, I think Pokemon as a series as soon as the 2nd gen had been established, was set on the path for remakes. The fans weren't going to just accept RSE without being able to get all their old favorites."
pokemon,fmju8sv,t1_fmjsrn0,1586137858.0,">Because it clearly wasn't very thought out.

Precisely, that's my entire point. We are talking strictly about gen 1, it makes no sense to introduce later retconned lore. In the first gen it's stated that nobody really knew where pokemon came from, thus there's a clear timeline when we didn't know about pokemon. And all I'm saying is that it seem to be highly advanced and pushed tech to deal with the situation. There's a lot of stuff that's been retconned over the years, doesn't take away from the fact that the universe which the first game sets up in a vacuum has a lot of unanswered questions which can be theorycrafted around, simply stating the proper retcons that happened after that isn't really the point of that type of theorycrafting. Nobody joins a steampunk RP and goes ""that's not how chemistry works!"".   


> The real reason is because they didn't plan ahead enough past the original 2 games 

I think this is a bit of a simplification as well. There's a lot of stuff introduced in gen 1, that was retconned already in gen 2, and later in gen 3, and new things were added to change those things in gen 4. Like it took them waay longer to figure stuff out. But it's not like they saw down before making Gold/Silver and just made a coherent timeline either. Like the fact that the original gen 2 games were going to be set in the entirety of Japan for example signifies a lot of things. The idea of universe-building really didn't become a thing until gen 3-4. But again, that's the point. That's why it's so interesting to theorycraft about Gen 1 and 2 because some of the things they established were retconned and some of those were pretty damn cool. We still have no idea what War Lt Surge was talking about, or how pokémon ghosts work, or the fact that they actually possessed human beings and shit."
pokemon,fmjs1ny,t1_fmjoxgh,1586136547.0,">gen 1 game only.

gen 3

  
Sound logic bro.   


Again, try and explaining it, only using RBY games or stadium if you'd like to explain whatever lore you're talking about. We already established we're talking about pre-1999 Pokemon here. You can't include unreleased information in that argument."
pokemon,fmjj78t,t1_fmjda8e,1586131394.0,">Cool thought, but incorrect.

Feel free to elaborate based on gen 1 game facts only. There's barely any lore at the time, and both ghosts and the war is unexplained and it's pretty clear they pivoted pokemon into being something different during gen 2's development and further developed it into what it is during gen 3.   


But there are some indications in gen 1 that pokemon was something that humanity has been forced to deal with in a short period of time. The PC storing, pokeballs and the fact that they're still being discovered via the Pokédex suggests this. I mean, if you were a kid growing up during gen 1 and later played gen 2, merely the existance of gender and breeding and eggs was an actual discovery they realized going further into the series. Sure it can be explained as gameplay broadening and feature expansion, but how it was set in the world lore-wise made it seem like it was actual real-time discoveries."
