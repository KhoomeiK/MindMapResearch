Fun fact - a mix of CO2 and O2 is called carbogen. It allows you to keep your blood O2 saturation high so you don't pass out, but gives you the feeling of suffocating. It was most famously used in psychedelic psychotherapy to induce the feeling of dying. It was originally used to induce seizures in schizophrenic patients, which is the basis of electroconvulsive therapy."

Of course, there are times where humble brags are acceptable - for example, if you're talking about money management, it would be more appropriate to bring up your stocks.

You will also need a candle, preferably black, although any color will work.

Second, clean the garden. Get rid of and debris and detritus. Clear the weeds. Make it look pretty. You don't have to do the whole yard, but it might help. Think of the faeries while you're doing it.

Third, give them the offerings. I usually like to do it at sunset, but time doesn't really matter. Light the candle and speak aloud. Introduce yourself as the son or daughter of your father, who took care of them. Explain that you were ignorant and didn't know how to take care of them. Apologize, and offer your gifts, and ask them to stop fucking with you. Thank them, and walk away. If it's safe, let the candle burn down in the garden. NOTE: DO NOT MAKE ANY PROMISES, AND WATCH YOUR PHRASING. The fae take things very literally, and promises are unbreakable bonds to them.

So now you're involved with the fae. Hopefully, this will make things good for a while. But you have to give periodic gifts to keep them satiated, and you have to tend their garden. With luck and dedication, they'll start to like you, and you can request things from them - just phrase it so that they have a choice whether or not to help you.

That's about it! Good luck, and report back!"
