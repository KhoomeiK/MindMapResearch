I don't know how to improve things- I've been thinking about martial arts as a way to grow a backbone? Also being less open seems like a good idea- dont feed people the information they can use to harm you. I've gone into the trap of trusting people who are nice to me and seeing the best in everyone.

I'm not sure if this kind of thing has happened with others but its quite interesting?!
On Friday I was thinking of asking for his assistance with another matter entirely- I perused the internets for help in finding good tenants/ neighbors at the place where I live- I found a thread on the lucky mojo 
http://forum.luckymojo.com/spell-work-to-attract-great-new-neighbors-t3229.html I was planning to gather supplies and go ahead with the reccomended wash and honey/cedar trick- in the back of my mind I was thinking maybe I should ask St Expedite for help too? I did not even do anything- no red candle, no petition- I was just mentally going through what I planned to do to find good neighbors. Before I left the office I got a call from a friend of a friend saying she wants to move next door- they are signing contracts with the landlord today! This is amazing! I am not sure if this was St Expedite jumping the gun or the spirits of the place or my guides and ancestors as I have done some offerings but I am so grateful for all of the beautiful assistance!!!
