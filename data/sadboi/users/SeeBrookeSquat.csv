BPD,fpkubl6,t3_gdvigh,1588701166.0,When you have no self esteem and cannot validate yourself you gotta get validation from somewhere. That mixed with the fact that women are told our worth comes from male attention it makes perfect sense why we do this. I also know it's an all or nothing kind of thing with us. Either all the men want us or none do. Frustrating.
SexWorkers,fphe418,t3_gdg2i5,1588619654.0,"Ehh. I'm not a huge fan of even recording and making content. It's not as easy as just letting the camera roll while we have sex.

AmItheAsshole,foz2zpc,t3_gaa8t7,1588183813.0,NTA. you can't go from professional to wild child and expect your SO to just be cool with it. They like the professional look obviously. That's part of why they chose you. Unconditional love is for children. Not adults. If you do a 180 you're not the same person they picked.

GenderCritical,exw0u0p,t1_ewsetq4,1566610304.0,I'm not a man and I'm not an anti-feminist looking to debate. I'm just a woman and a sex worker giving her opinion of what it's actually like to do the job. It's a shame you don't want to hear someone who actually works in this environment opinion

GenderCritical,ews16qx,t3_cptnt2,1565718087.0,"I am a stripper and massage girl and I will say It's empowering because they're paying me for a service that they should be able to get for free but are not. It's empowering because I get to choose who I perform my services for. It's empowering because men will hand over their entire salaries just to touch me. It's also extremely empowering because I have no set schedule, nobody expects me to work any specific hours, I don't have to call off or ask if I can go to the doctor. If I don't feel like working I don't. If I feel like working 7 days a week I can. It gives me the flexibility to live the life I really want to. Prostitution is the world's oldest profession because men will always be willing to pay for women's attention. Why not profit off of it?"
