Just because you think other drugs are worse doesn't eliminate the risks of the drugs you're taking. The other thing to consider is the your brain isn't fully developed (human brains are fully developed by the age of 25). Drug use can impact this development by permanently altering neuro pathways.

Your seroquel experience is just like mine. I can normally start to function properly from late morning but, yeah, the mood roulette wheel starts spinning in the afternoon. 

I've managed to avoid the weight gain so far and I'm starting with a personal trainer next week to make sure it stays that way :)"
bipolar,f04gfgs,t1_f04f952,1568386972.0,"Glad it's no just me. I'm not normally narky, but I'm easily triggered in that period between drowsy and up. 

I'll see what the psych has to say at my next appointment."
bipolar,ezzpfii,t1_ezzlemt,1568290865.0,"That's an option - but I quite like my evenings and I also play in band. I'm a staggering wreck after taking this stuff. That said, I've normally downed them 22:30 and even then waking up before eight is almost impossible."

bipolar,ez8tc4g,t1_ez7yw48,1567758394.0,"Don't say that! I'm off to get my second tattoos in 48 hours and I'm already considering a third. 

It wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that prior to Wednesday my total tattoo count was zero."
Guitar,exfqomr,t1_exfeanu,1566246318.0,"That's such a cool education. I'd love to have experienced something like that.

Clearly I've missed something in my thinking (I'm all over weird modes and quarter notes as I also play Armenian duduk). How does, for example, the Arabic system of 24 notes in an octave work with western theory? I honestly can't see how the two are reconciled."
Guitar,exfcckd,t1_exf0zag,1566237465.0,"So you learned, for example, the model differences in Indian classical music, the importance of ragas, thaats etc? These don't appear in western music theory.

You also have to consider the importance of quarter tones in many forms of music, which is something that isn't accounted for in Western music theory."
Guitar,exf00t1,t1_exewlon,1566229488.0,"That's not so simple - western theory is great if you're in (most) of western Europe or North America, but if you're raised elsewhere chances are you've been taught differently. Here's a good primer:

bipolar,ewsjmfh,t1_ewrp35j,1565728917.0,"Thanks mate. It still feels weird to know that I've spent most of my life holding on life by my fingertips, having people ask me to slow down or if there's something wrong, being an alcoholic and addict, somehow maintaining a successful career and raising a family and all the while that feeling that there was something wrong with me was right all along. 

Sucks to know that it all could possibly have been easier. 


I'm with you on the shocks coming off antidepressants. I stopped them about ten days ago (psychiatrist wanted me off them quickly, so went from full dose to none in a week) and I'm still getting jolts, although they're lessening now. 


Also weird being alcohol and drug free for the first time since I was 14. Just hope I don't pick up any other addictions - last time I quit drugs I developed a ruinous gambling habit to replace it. 


Even weirder is dealing with BP states sober. Depression is though when you can't drink to oblivion and mania is far more, er, exciting when you can't knock the top of it with drugs :)"
Guitar,ewqzakt,t3_cplcfi,1565686791.0,"I have a one of their baritones. It's the cheapest guitar I've ever bought and price is reflected in the quality of the instrument. However, I got plenty of bang for my buck. It's really nice to play, I can gets some great sound out of it via my Helix and, if I lost the damn thing I'd be happy to pay for another."
Guitar,ewap3te,t3_cnfdxk,1565248578.0,"Weirdly it was hearing the guitar solo on Together in Electric Dreams back in 1984. I'd played classical guitar but really wasn't that into it. Heard this, thought ""that's how guitars should sound"" and, within six months, had discovered heavy metal, got my hands on a shitty electric guitar with and action so high you could measure it in inches and formed a band with some mates."
bipolar,ew6er6w,t1_ew55rnq,1565165839.0,And that's why I'm skint again this week.
Guitar,evxs0pu,t3_clm2yr,1564904859.0,Same thing happened to me a couple of years ago when my mum said she'd found one of my old guitars. Turned out to be my old Aria Pro II MM Stage 1 K-PI. Absolutely mental Matsumoko-era beast. Single humbucker powered by two 9v batteries.
bipolar,etiuww6,t3_cbwlqi,1562860358.0,"Just left rehab for alcohol and substance abuse and my psychiatrist diagnosed me with BP once my head had cleared.  I now have sertraline for breakfast and mirtazapine with litium for dinner. 

I highly recommend staying on the mood stabilizers. BP and addiction often go hand in hand. 

And keep hitting NA :)"

Have you tried using coated strings? That could be a safer alternative."
Guitar,eppcisc,t1_epod9t6,1559373579.0,"No problem. In that case, your definitely better off with a fixed bridge (or you can do what I recently did and pick up a Shuriken Variax - then you have access to every tuning you can think of at the touch of a button)."
Guitar,epl3fgb,t3_bv154b,1559286657.0,"Agree with the point about floating trems being difficult is blown out of proportion. If you know that they work by balancing tension and how to adjust that, you're good to go.

I bought my first 'proper' guitar in '87. That had a Floyd and there was no internet to help out. I remember changing my strings to 10s and quickly realising I had to adjust the springs to balance it out. It didn't take too long.

Changing tunings, though, is a complete pain :)"
