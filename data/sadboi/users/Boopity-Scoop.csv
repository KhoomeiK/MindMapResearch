Oh and I made a little mistake thanks to the autocorrect, I meant to write psychology, not sociology.


To be honest, it's the fist time I've ever been called strong for breaking out of that, it really means the world to me, from the bottom of my heart thank you, I'll take your advice and try to talk about it in the appointment, and if they don't ask me anything about it, I might just make an appointment for it myself! After all, my tuition fees cover for it 


I really appreciate that you took time to read this and give me such amazing advice, thank you!!!"

Almost five years later (another kid) tried to choke one of my friends while we were all playing at recess together, needless to say he got sent to the school's psychologist."
