mentalhealth,fc3pit3,t1_fc3kt9i,1577395402.0,"If you’re doing it with earbuds, you could always try keeping one out so you can still hear around you. I’ve done this once where I was sitting in a corner spot against a wall and a wall to my right. I kept the left earbud in and only allowed sound that flowed around the room and to my right against the wall. It probably did nothing different lol but it made me feel better at least. Isn’t that what we’re all after when struggling with mental illness? To get things just a little bit better.

mentalhealth,fc3l88l,t3_eg0fda,1577392334.0,"No no no please don’t. It can take a while for the effects to show. Your body is still running off the meds that are still in your bloodstream. 
I had to quite my SSRI once over an insurance issue and it wasn’t pretty. I thought I’d be fine since it was a medium dose and I “felt normal”. Nope. After a week or two, I got VERY depressed and emotional and I was back to my crying spells almost every day. Coming off of meds can make you feel much much worse before better. Talk to your professionals and see about slowly lowering the dose but don’t just quit altogether on your own. It’s too risky."
mentalhealth,fc3gbve,t1_fc3e2rr,1577389177.0,"Ah yes, running into people! That makes complete sense. I used to avoid certain grocery stores in my old neighborhood for the same reason. 
I’m glad the meds are helping your OCD. I wonder how your OCD would react to noise cancelling headphones and if you’d be able to relax enough to enjoy them. I use headphones while out for those same reasons but, with my OCD, I’m constantly looking over my shoulders because my brain thinks someone is following me or about to attack me and I can’t hear them coming. I’ve learned which areas I can use them and which areas aren’t “safe” for me yet. 
I’d recommend checking it out though! You might find yourself relaxing more with them in but if not, keep your receipt! Haha."

I can relate to some of how you’re feeling. I spend a LOT of time alone and currently don’t work. A lot happened after my last job and I fell into a depressive wasteland. I feel like less than a human being sometimes because everyone else gets up, goes to work, and has their normal days but I spend my days alone and guilty over the fact that I’m too depressed and anxious to work at the moment. 
The 2 hours a week you give the food bank is commendable. Be proud of the things you CAN do. 
I’m 30 and feel like I couldn’t bear another 30 years like this either. I try to remind myself that not every day feels this shitty. When a good day does creep around, try to savor it. Write down the good things and how they made you feel. Future you will appreciate it on those dark days that need a reminder or two. 
Life’s hard and it can really suck. I get it. Take comfort in knowing you’re not alone. We’re all trying to figure this out."
