BPD,f9rs167,t3_e5g99o,1575580478.0,"Yeah I totally get that, it’s natural human instinct to want to defend yourself (i was the rebel and “bad child” for speaking up for myself even if it was respectful and I just wanted a conversation.. but I could never win due to the manipulation and guilt tripping) If they are narcs (your parents- I apologize if that’s too forward) there’s really no way to have your point get across to them, because only what’s in their eyes is right and we will never win even when we are right. So live for yourself! 

I’m so damn proud of you for being strong and getting through this. It’s shitty, it’s unfair, but it was the cards we were dealt and it’s only going to make you even MORE strong in the end after all the pain has been addressed and taken care of mentally/emotionally. It’s going to take a while but you deserve so much more than what they tell you and you’re going to get past this and kick ass in the world. I’m glad I could help at least a little, positive vibes all the time! We gotta manifest that shit and keep these negative narcs out of our heads so they don’t bring us down any more than they already have in the past and present, and maybe even in the future- but that’s okay. We learned by seeing what not to be. Cheers to being the best person you can be, that WE ALL can be!"

changemyview,f9k2rpk,t3_e5c32d,1575391541.0,"That is a double standard there, perhaps you should get new friends that will let you believe what you want and support you as long as you aren’t harming yourself.

I believe in something, I don’t know what it is but I’m no longer agnostic anymore. I also believe in supernatural entities/ beings existing in other planets/dimensions, but I wouldn’t ever tell someone they are wrong for believing what they believe if they thought otherwise. I’d sit, listen, and acknowledge what they said, and give my point of view- I won’t tolerate non receptive/ closed off from changing types of people

We’re all entitled to our own opinions and beliefs!!"
BPD,f9k1pdl,t1_f9jpup1,1575390866.0,"You set up a boundary! That’s awesome, I’m happy for it being a success for you"
BPD,f9k1188,t3_e5g99o,1575390438.0,"You aren’t overreacting at all, they’re directly flipping what you’re feeling back onto you, most likely because they can’t handle what’s going on in their own heads’ themselves. Potential narcissists? I’ve got a similar relationship with my parents (both narcs) and it’s caused so much turmoil within myself and my other relationships to the point where I got so fed up with it I decided it’s either them out of my life, or me giving up on myself without trying. I just turned 21 last week and I’m still realizing that my parents were wrong even when I was a child as my memories come back (still in the process). My therapist taught me about boundaries, and I was able to compartmentalize the different types of relationships i have and what exactly are the boundaries within each of them- ie. boundaries within family members, work relationships, friendships, acquaintances, etc.- if the relationship wasn’t mutually beneficial in any way, I would address it as nice as possible and let them know they have crossed a boundary and that it made me FEEL a certain way and that I wanted to let them know so we can build a stronger relationship through communication and with respect. If they were unwilling to help the situation, I’d either cut them off (depending on the type of relationship) or I would say (this is setting up a boundary) “I love you, but you really hurt my feelings and make me feel bad about myself every time we talk, I can’t have you in my life if you aren’t going to try to acknowledge that and change.”
Or If they’re anything like my parents they might say “waaaahhh pity party” or “you’re so week” or “after all I’ve done for you, wow you’re so ungrateful” and then try to gaslight you/ take the words out your mouth and switch them around, then that might be the time to choose whether your mental health is more important or if what they think of you is. Draw that line, make those boundaries, and don’t ever let anyone make you question who you are and make you feel like your feelings are invalid. They are very valid and the damage will take years to repair, but you can do it. It’s no easy feat, especially when it comes to the people you just want to make proud, but we just have to remember that we are living for ourselves and no one else. Maybe they also have a personality disorder and aren’t as far along as you are in accepting and being the being the best person you can be.. 
I cut my methhead mom out of my life this year after she kept crashing in and out since I was 11 and made fun of me for my BPD, Bipolar 1, CPTSD, and Major Depressive Disorder diagnosis’ and then I tried setting the boundaries with my father. Honestly I’m still working on him with this one, since he’s really been my only parent since I was a teen, but he’ll still say things like “You’re being weak” or “I won’t trust you until you’re off your medication and ‘normal’” and in those moments I’ll literally think of him as a child that can’t handle his own emotions so he turns it onto me and I ignore him and say “whatever, “OKAY” hahaha”, or “you made me haha” and put it back at him like a joke. Sometimes I tell him witty things like “yes it’s all in my head dad, look at my brain mappings, there’s clear data showing overfiring in parts of my head” and then say “I’m going to hang up if  you don’t have anything nice to say, because this conversation won’t help either of us”.
Sometimes you have to learn the ways of playing the game back and not letting them win over you.

Either way, you’re strong as hell OP and I hope you can see your true beauty and self worth. This life is a hard enough journey as it is, so we should love ourselves and make decisions that will help and not hurt. I’m proud of you for reaching out and for being here in this very moment.
Sending lots of good vibes your way~"
BPD,f9jwx13,t1_f953ks3,1575387730.0,"You’re winning the war if you’re still here. You’ve made it through 100% of what life has thrown at you and you’re going to keep doing it. Time heals I promise, and even when you’re feeling the relief of healing, some days will still feel like a catastrophe. Just tell yourself tomorrow will be a new day and take each moment and run with it. Awareness is everything, and you’re strong as hell for being here on this post. Look out for reoccurring thoughts and write them down on paper (physically write them down) and go through each one and see what you can do to help it, if you can’t help one in that moment, move to the next one and work with that. When it’s out on paper, it’s not running back and forth in your head making your brain feel like scrambled eggs. If that doesn’t help, something else definitely will, you just can’t give up on yourself before trying or else you’re just setting your day up for hurt- you don’t deserve to hurt, you deserve to HEAL. Every day is a win no matter what. You did it, and I’m proud as hell."

BPD,f9jv92s,t1_f93u0j0,1575386603.0,"I’m proud of you for making it through this reading, you should be too hun. I know a year ago from today I would have had a whole complete episode from simply facing the fact of acceptance and moving forward with BPD, so I dissociated instead.  I tried fighting my urge to internalize my pain and hurt myself, and chose to accept the moment of dissociation and acknowledge that ‘it will pass’. I guess choosing to love myself and fight this disorder while having small wins at a time was the most rewarding thing I could have done for myself, and I just realized in this moment that I have not dissociated for almost a week. Whereas I used to dissociate multiple times in a day or have such dissociative episodes that I didn’t remember my whole day. Being aware and self-practice of acceptance might just be what you need in order to love yourself more, maybe not, what matters is there is something for YOU out there that will help and is waiting for you to discover it. You’ve made it past 100% of every difficult and debilitating situation in your life-think about it- and I KNOW you can do this. I hope I helped in some way with my story and advice, it’s okay if I didn’t- what matters is you’re still here today (I’m proud) and you have a whole beautiful journey of ups and downs to go through, waiting for you to keep being the badass that you are. You can do this

Sending all the positive and good vibes your way, much love~"
BPD,f9jtlkf,t1_f935e3x,1575385448.0,"I am so proud of you for choosing to help yourself, I’ve been there/ still am there, but I have noticed that after actively staying aware of each trigger and my reactions  to them, the feelings that come with them have become less debilitating over time- they’re still there and hurt like hell, but I’ll take that progress and run with it anyways. You did that by acknowledging your BPD and being here on this very post, and I’m sure you’re going to find the pursuit of your recovery more rewarding than anything as you go along wherever life takes you on this beautiful journey. There’s always going to be breakdowns, and moments of full on tears crashing in when you have no idea why, but we can’t focus on the “why”, it’ll only make us spiral- instead, accept that you are a beautiful human that feels emotion and embrace that and yourself at the very same time, because YOU deserve it. I’m one of those firm believers in “everything happens for a reason” and I believe you found yourself here a few days ago for a reason, as did I(:

I wish you so much luck and I’m sending all the good vibes I possibly can to you and the OP. Much love~"
