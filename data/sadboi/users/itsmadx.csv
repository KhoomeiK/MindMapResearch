OCPoetry,fm66ncq,t3_ftaf3o,1585787413.0,"This basically describes very poignantly the end of a night out, and I completely feel like I've been taken back to the feeling I get when I walk home from a club or pub, tired but still kind of drunk. I think it's really well written- ie, the fact so many weirds near rhyme or do rhyme, however, at the same time, the fact you haven't forced yourself to stick to a rhyme pattern means that the poem itself flows better. I actually think the way it it's freeform rhyme (?) makes it great to read. My terminology may be off, however."
OCPoetry,fm666fk,t3_ftb7yr,1585787129.0,"I love the comparison of heartbreak to disease (""it spread and infected my everything/ a virus of pain and trauma and loss"") as it really hits home how bad the heartbreak is, to the point that the speaker is physically afflicted. A lot of the metaphors really hit him as well as they're quite brutal, ie, ""nothing left but cold scraps and bones,"" which adds to the raw tone of the whole poem. This really is a beautiful poem, one I felt I could relate to a lot."
OCPoetry,fm5zqyf,t1_fm5zo84,1585783283.0,thank you! I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that though.
OCPoetry,fm5nt25,t3_fshcyb,1585776461.0,"This poem paints a really vivid picture in my mind of someone who has had a hectic work day, and has a few moments to literally smell the flowers- The fact it's something she does everyday is highlighted by the fact it's ""ritualistic,"" which suggests to me that smelling the flowers is something she enjoys enough to do every day. For the last line, I prefer ""saving their fragrant freedom"" because not only does ""saving"" imply that she's looking to revere in the memory later on, but ""fragrant freedom"" also helps to impress exactly how much of an escape smelling the flowers is for her."
OCPoetry,fm5n0h8,t3_ft7bdw,1585776020.0,"I love the sense of familiarity the speaker has with the person they are talking about, versus how much they actually know about the person; ie, ""I never know what you've eaten for breakfast."" This is because the contradiction between the feelings the speaker has against the knowledge of the persons actual life really demonstrates exactly how strong the speakers feelings are for someone they don't really seem to know. The last stanza is brilliant- I feel like it shows that the person the speaker is talking about doesn't need to be fixed/helped, whereas the speaker wants to help fix this person. (Ie, wrapping them up in toilet paper.) The last line I also love- again, it highlights how little the speaker knows the person they are fantasising about with the little detail of actually, they don't like breakfast at all."

OCPoetry,flgrs3f,t3_focw5m,1585149046.0,"I really like it, however, I would say that it would flow better if the last stanza was split into two? I love the concept though, and the comparisons you have made- I would definitely read more if it were longer, however at this length it also works."

BPD,fl746lh,t1_fl69npc,1584893842.0,"The thing is, if you talk to someone and they don‚Äôt want to date you or stop talking to you, this is 100% normal. Sometimes they have other stuff going on.

Someone told me being happy isn‚Äôt a constant. It‚Äôs just when you have highs and lows. Logic tells me if I have some happy, serene moments, then I can get better to the point where I have them more than lows. 

That helps me."

Weird thing is, my new therapist refuses to ‚Äúname‚Äù it BPD in therapy sessions as it‚Äôs ‚Äòcounter productive,‚Äô apparently. :/"
