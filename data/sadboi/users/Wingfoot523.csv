PanicAttack,fpbfp9t,t3_gcfgxr,1588468942.0,"Yeah you most likely had one. Best thing is to catch it as you noticing coming on. It can take a few times to know when it's coming on though. 

What works for me is to breath in my nose for 4 seconds, hold for seven, and breath out through my mouth for 8. Do this as many times as you need to.
Another thing that can help is looking at 5 things around where you are. You can also tell yourself what you can smell, hear, feel. These techniques help  being you back to the moment.

Also try not to worry about having another one, panic attacks can't hurt you physically."
PanicAttack,fpa7fjm,t3_gca0vm,1588442338.0,"Honestly, if you really want weed, just go with something more indica (high CBD, low THC). Just from reading other peoples experiences, it doesn't take much for weed to trigger worse panic attacks (ie; getting too high /the weed not working well with your personal brain chemistry). 
If you don't want to take SSRI's I would say get very potent CBD. Medterra makes a really good oil tincture that has ~100mg in a dose, but you can obviously take more or less based on you preference.
CBD just seems like the best alternative in my opinion because it can really help with panic, and you can still function as you would normally since it doesn't get you high.
I'm not a doctor, so just take this as my personal opinion. Do what you believe is best for yourself :)"

I think some of it may be trauma from my bad experience and also my preexisting anxiety and existential thoughts that I've always had, but now they are practically compulsive and intrusive.

Anxiety,flfmjtc,t1_flflfaa,1585110677.0,"I got dissociation and panic attacks/paranoia almost every time I smoked, which is why I will never smoke again. Weed is probably the reason why I still suffer from panic attacks tbh. But anyways, since you're not 18 you could have a parent/guardian get it online/ grocery store/ and probably some other places. It's kind of expensive but get the most potent stuff, which will contain usually 50-100mg in a dose. At your age I wouldn't worry about not smoking, and many people would advise not to since you are underage (and it's illegal)."
Anxiety,flfk7kb,t1_fle6ab7,1585108763.0,"It's funny because THC can cause dissociation to many people, but it usually ends when the high ends. If you just want a relaxed feeling and don't care about the high buy some CBD gummies or a CBD oil tincture and take anywhere from 50-150mg of it. That amount can give you that relaxed body feeling without psychoactive effects and could really help with panic attacks and dissociation. And I'de definitely try it before taking benzos or something. Not that benzos are bad, it's just that CBD is much more subtle, non-addictive, and can have really positive effects sometimes."
