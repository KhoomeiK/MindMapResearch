sex,fgjqqzf,t1_fgjl7fh,1580849543.0,Wow some guys are jerks. I'm a guy and I am terrified of STDs/Kids. I am definitely not ready to be a dad.
television,fgj1970,t1_fgiwo7j,1580835057.0,In First Contact it makes sense though. I mean they were sent back in time and the Enterprise is overtaken by the Borg. No time for diplomacy. Shoot first and ask questions later.
sex,fg3hfnt,t1_fg2wyb6,1580481610.0,That's a smart idea.
Anxiety,fg204we,t3_ewcw67,1580435853.0,Same I had my first panic attack in close to a year the other night. It's largely worrying about something stupid in my case. That being said I can't shake the panic attack or the worry off my mind. I haven't been able to sleep much at all the last few nights.
FreeKarma4U,fg1zn7s,t1_fg1danm,1580435636.0,I got you man.
Anxiety,fg1zjxl,t1_fg1knf0,1580435593.0,"It gets bad when I have to try any new. When I'm not good at it, I assume everyone hates me and is mad at me. Even with new video games if I am playing with friends."
sex,fg1zaks,t1_fg1df68,1580435477.0,I prefer to avoid STDs and any chance of knocking a girl up.
FreeKarma4U,fg1z8bi,t1_fg1gr4t,1580435449.0,Thank you for the Karma. I was able to start the thread I needed.
Anxiety,fg1bd8l,t3_ewbhpn,1580424140.0,I have such terrible posture. I need to do this more. I have the hardest time sitting still.
sex,fg1b08y,t1_fg19sez,1580423966.0,Oh ok. I didn't notice any change in feeling.
sex,fg1avaw,t1_fg19rhf,1580423896.0,"I'm assuming she was on birth control. I'm pretty sure most girls these days are. She was my first hookup and not a girlfriend. I definitely didn't notice any spillage.

It watched Knocked Up for the first time and I woke up the other night panicking and thinking ""what if the condom broke and I didn't know."" 

I always plan on using condoms."
sex,fg1atcl,t3_ewbmv0,1580423868.0,That sounds kind of mean. I like it when a girl takes her time to make herself feel sexy. As a guy it makes me happy knowing a girl wants to be sexy.
sex,fg1a79e,t1_fg19rkf,1580423554.0,There was no precum down my shaft as far as I could tell. I only used fingers during foreplay and our genitals were no where near each other until I put the first condom on.
Anxiety,fg19vo1,t3_etpmus,1580423395.0,"I've had this feeling since I was a teenager. I'm in my late 20s now. I naturally assume everyone hates me. Family, friends, coworkers, cashiers, other drivers on the road, the lady cutting my hair, etc. I don't assume this all the time but when my anxiety is bad and I mess up on things, I assume everyone hates me."
sex,fg19bcn,t1_fg18z01,1580423118.0,"Ok. I had the little ""pouch"" for lack of a better word at the top. It was full when we were done. I didn't think about running it underwater, I just threw it away.

I have anxiety issues and worry about the most random things. I also watched Knocked Up for the first time recently and it kind of freaked me out."
FreeKarma4U,fg18v8l,t1_fg18jd5,1580422897.0,"I loved End Game and thought it was the perfect ending to the series.

My favorites are probably Winter Soldier, Iron Man 1 and the original Avengers. The Daredevil TV series is probably my favorite thing from the MCU. I want season 4. I hope we get it on Disney Plus."
FreeKarma4U,fg1831j,t1_fg16uo4,1580422533.0,"Classic Family guy. Mom, mom, mom, mom, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy, mama,mama,mama,mama..."

FreeKarma4U,fg16k21,t3_ew85wx,1580421727.0,Is Stowie the Doodlebob version of Stewie? Perhaps Stewie invents a machine that makes Stowie come to life and him and Brian have to fight it.
FreeKarma4U,fg15gq2,t3_ew9zj4,1580421124.0,I love the MCU so Upvoted.
aww,fg14dsz,t1_fg13yse,1580420517.0,I know you just told me a cool story about meeting a kangaroo but I can't help but feel sad about your cat. I'm sorry about your cat man.
