Paranormal,es2qgk0,t3_c5hk50,1561535020.0,"i used to work in a bar for a few months, and many of the gals i worked with had a few stories about weird things happening and agreed that there was a weird ghostly presence. the bar had two floors and the second floor/basement was closed off but the office and the bathroom that the staff used was down there and it always just felt off. for a long time i didn't really experience anything significant, or when i did, i didn't think much of it. at one time i was sweeping the upstairs area and it was pretty dead when i feelt a tap on my shoulder, and turned around only to see no one behind me. i thought literally nothing of it until a few weeks later, when after my shift i went downstairs to change in the creepy bathroom. that day, the downstairs area felt more off than usual. i was walking into the bathroom when i heard a wooden chair move across the floor. i felt my blood turn cold and i bolted in the bathroom, changed faster than i've ever changed before and ran upstairs. once i told my co worker, she told me some of her own experiences in the bar. talking about it made us both suspicious and creeped out and i agreed to stay with her to close the bar. we went downstairs to do the final count and everyone including the kitchen staff had left and we had locked up, leaving us the only two left in the building. when doing the count we kept hearing things in the kitchen which was directly to the right of the top of the stairs. we did our best to ignore it and left as soon as we could. after that i personally didn't experience anything else like that. anyhow sorry for rambling! definitely creeped myself out writing this lol."

depression,ergdht8,t3_anh7tv,1560834799.0,"Today I slept in really late thinking I had the day off, (my fault because I looked at the wrong schedule) and when I got the text from my co-worker who asked if I was coming in, I just felt numb and apathetic and turned off my phone and went back to sleep. I feel really bad and I don't know what to tell my boss. It's just a coffee shop and I've been meaning to quit for a while, I also had to go on a mental health leave of absence a few months ago from this job, so I don't love it. I've called in a few days recently and I'm pretty sure my boss will probably be fed up but I just also sort of don't care. This year my depression has been the worst, I came close to killing myself and went on a medication change and things got a lot better for me mentally, only for the recent past few months. I can feel myself slipping into that depressive slump, where I can't function or do anything productive. I slept literally all day today and now I will up all night, thinking about how I fucked up again, I just turned 25 also so as you can tell I'm adulting really well. I don't know what to do, I need to apply for jobs but whenever I get a response I am unmotivated to reply and I put it off until it's too late. I was supposed to start a new job last week but I got too anxious to go in, so I fucked that opportunity. Feel like I will be doomed forever because I can't be bothered to get my shit together."
