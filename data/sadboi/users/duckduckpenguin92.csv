Back story, I’m super close with my parents , and they moved back to my Mom’s home province (Canada) last year. I never had the chance to spend time around that side of the family growing up, and there wasn’t much going for me in my hometown, so I knew I’d eventually move . 

I was working my ass off and getting no where with my current job in April, that had nothing to do with what I went to school for. I asked to get a small raise when i found out part timers made more than me and a few other things going on, where I was being taken advantage of . Within that week my coworker also suddenly passed away. I put in my two week notice right then, said fuck it, packed up my life and move back in with my parents for the summer. 

Next I also starting talking to a guy before I moved, we hardly knew each other and when I did leave we continued taking. He came to visit me in July, and his fuck it moment was deciding he was also done with our home province and came up with me. He got a job in a city 2 hours away from my parents so I packed up again and moved in with him ( at this point we’ve hung out in person a few weeks). 

Last week I started my new job, in the new city, with a company that actually lines up with my career goals, making a lot more money than I was in April. I look back at how much as change and it amazes me.  If it wasn’t for those fuck it moments, my life would be completely different right now."
