CPTSD,fr6oc16,t3_gmt2o9,1589930007.0,"I've been thinking about childhood memories a lot lately. I relate to this post so much because if you actually take the time to think about your childhood (which if youre on this sub and obviously and somewhat probably intentionally dont... than maybe you also should?) lol the ones that actually are memorable and the ones that come to mind... usually speak volumes...

For me I have been realizing that this is especially true... And the crazy part is this... the more traumas I face... the more memories start unfolding... luckily not every single thing in my life has been bad.... but it is interesting to note that the pieces are actually still there when you let them be!

I also read somewhere that the first/earliest memories of your life also say a lot... but that kind of falls under the same reasoning and logic that I was mentioning just now writing this anyway! :)

What are your earliest memories????"

(aka coke in your case....) make sure that you are not just using these steps as a sort of foreshadowing for as far as when you will get your next fix... you need to keep adding steps or you will lose sight of the bigger picture... what MORE can you do to ensure you quit???? my suggestion.... START WRITING DOWN A LIST A BODY PARTS THAT YOU ACTUALLY ENJOY BEING ALIVE TO APPRECIATE AND USE...

I get your frustration.. I do... I've dated drug addicts... and their behavior is so childlike and manipulative and backwards it is PATHETIC!!!! Please stop wasting valuable time trying to figure these losers out!!! There's nothing to figure out!!! They're self centered pieces of shit...

The fact that he followed you into a room he never goes in just to test your boundaries and start an argument with you, goes to show how narcissistically entitled he is and incapable of respect!!! 

You dont have to tell me that your self respect is nonexistent... the fact that you are putting up with any of this from a grown man... I believe you!!! (no judgement... but girl you gotta pull out of this!!!)

To see somebody treat their girlfriend like he is is completely disgusting.

Kick that man to the curb. It's time to open back up to your friends and family and therapist for support (maybe tell your therapist a half truth if thats easier for you...) but find your support and call the police!!! It's restraining order time girl!!! you got this!!!! :) <3 :) <3 

Let yourself be proud that you do this for yourself again. No shame in your own self love! Dont hate yourself for letting him back in! Love yourself by kicking him back out! lmao boy bye... ""go learn what it takes to grow up somewhere else... or dont..."" im sure he can figure it out!"
abusiveparents,fquplqb,t3_gknucr,1589662636.0,"I am sorry that you are going through this. I also know what it's like to be scapegoated for your parents own irrational and cruel behavior. They don't see anything wrong with their behavior because it was probably also what was done to them.. so you are expected to just sort of put your head down and try to deal with it.

I just want you to know (even though I'm sure that you already do... that this is in no way right... It's very likely that your parents are mentally ill and probably just crying out for help themselves.... (USED toilet paper on the sink.... what was he even THINKING!) Your mothers emotional outburst in response also goes to show that she is equally part of the insanity.

I read a lot, and particularly I am an enthusiast when it comes to psychologically and in one of the books Im working on, the author describes how rats and monkeys and humans alike, we all attack when hurt. It biologically makes us feel better and even when we are hurt from someone higher up the hierarchy than us.... we still just respond by hurting someone else lowering down or equal to us... It's like I mentioned biologically relieving. It seems to me, based on what you discussed about the situation, that your father was very likely setting up this scenario subconsciously... seeking his own sort of feelings of relief or closure.

Your very rational impulse to interrupt your parents conversation for something that any other normal humans would have responded to as ""important"" was then an opportunity to attribute you to their own feelings of shame.... They left you with the small, and peculiarly planted seed that it was in fact somehow your fault.

These sorts of small errors resulting in such emotionally degrading responses and outbursts from your parents are completely unacceptable and you have right to feel the way that you do.

Please know that so many of us have to deal with our cruel and injust upbringings from our otherwise reasonable insane parental figure lol smfh.

I also have a channel on this sort of thing if you want to join me there.... [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd1ikz0\_b6Ngx1mouoRA7cQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd1ikz0_b6Ngx1mouoRA7cQ)?

abusiveparents,fqtc069,t1_fqsmtav,1589635712.0,"I completely agree! Its hard to let go of the search for reason because it feels like youre giving up a part of your self... But the truth is that part is nothing more than a broken child eternally longing to be loved! There is a higher power, greater than the ""bigger"" beings that are own parents are even. There is a truly greater love..  A mystical force of reason that awaits for us... As soon as we are willing to accept our far greater purpose! 💖💖💖💖 Of course its very possible that may be why they never liked us in the first place. Giving up on our loved ones does not always mean that we are doing something wrong... And have to see those people who we have truly loved and longed for our entire lives.... For who they really are... that again can be one of the hardest things to try and accept!!! 💖💖💖💖💖 Thank you so much for your response.

It is over now. It's a new day and you have a new future and a new opportunity to heal. Your father made mistakes. Big ones. And they probably cost him his life. You do not have to pay for his sins anymore than he already has! You can let this go! You can be free! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3

So they dont. They see you hurting. They see you in pain. But they dont stop it. Because they just dont care. The sooner you accept this, the sooner you wont need closure anymore, because you have it.
