ftm,fk2nyei,t3_fg4pbt,1583805193.0,i felt this! my roommates are both cis guys and both have mentioned donating their facial hair to me. :')

BPD,f8lxpx4,t3_e0zwdg,1574626337.0,yes!!! i absolutely whole-heartedly relate 100% lol. i have a carefully constructed self image and the smallest thing being out of place will ruin my self-esteem for the rest of the day.
BPD,f8lwasy,t3_e12gy9,1574626028.0,"it's entirely possible to lead a (mostly) normal life if you have BPD or BP. there's a lot to take into account, like financial stability, mental stability (obviously lol), and if you can provide the resources a child needs. also remember you are not your parents!!"
BPD,f73vqpb,t3_du3wt4,1573395617.0,"yes!! my SO (and FP) got a new video game and when he plays it instead of paying attention to me i have the tendency to go into a blind fuckin rage. i'm getting better with it now, but i had abandoned all my hobbies, opting to use that time to pay attention to just him, and (stupidly) expected him to do the same smh. i've never brought this up with him though...it's healthy for my FP to have hobbies and interests outside of me. sometimes it just takes reminding myself of that."
BPD,f2fjast,t3_dd7xo2,1570218578.0,"i've been with my boyfriend for just over 7 months and i feel this same way. all the time. what helps me is just telling him exactly how i feel, recognizing that it isn't rational, assuring him that he did nothing wrong, and suggesting things that would make me feel more secure. he has a friend i'm incredibly jealous of and i was straightforward about it, and i offered for her to come to our apartment because if i got to know her better i wouldn't be so inclined to hate her lol. it takes a lot of DBT to get around the instinct not to trust, but you can do it! ðŸ–¤"
