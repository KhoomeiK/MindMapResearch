gtd,ethxxp7,t3_cbnpzb,1562830947.0,"My process would be this:

1.  System reminds me to refill prescription
2.  Put drop off prescription on my errands list
3.  Mark the calendar entry complete (as it recurs)
4.  Drop off the prescription
5.  Edit the errand to say Pick up prescription
6.  Pick up prescription
7.  Mark the errand complete

Another way.
1) Recurring says to refill prescription
2) Drop off prescription
3) Recurring task still says to refill prescription
4) Pick up prescription
5) Mark recurring task complete and trust that it will remind you again next month

I also have my pharmacy on auto refill with text notification, which saves a few steps
 1) receive Text that Rx is ready
 2) add errand to pick up Rx
 3) Pick up Rx
 4) Mark errand completr

YMMV"
depression,ethwfu5,t3_cbov4p,1562829505.0,"I invite you to celebrate the win of asking for a date...no matter what alternative ways you think you could have done it.  


As someone who experiences depression I ask you what other people ask me in these situations:

1) do you commit to being there at that time no matter how symptomatic your depression is that day?  (Because depression may play tricks on you to get you to stay home)

2) do you commit to experiencing just showing up as a win for yourself, regardless of whether she is there?  (Because ypu have no control over whether she shows up and depression will try to jump on that shit)

I invite you to take on those two commitments and take ownership of your experience, no matter what signals the depression sends you.

You showing up and owning your interpretation of what happens may support you in doing more of this, and that sounds like it would be a good thing."
