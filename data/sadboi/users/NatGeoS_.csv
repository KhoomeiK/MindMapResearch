PrincessesOfPower,fqzf4kg,t3_glb44j,1589766056.0,"I‚Äôm so bummed I saw your post earlier and it spoiled it for me. I thought people would be safe and respectful on Reddit like they usually are. I convinced myself it was a scene you wanted to draw or that you just redrew a previous drawing with their new hair styles. 
But come on. Think before you post."
