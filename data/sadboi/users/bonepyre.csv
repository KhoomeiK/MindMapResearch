BodyDysmorphia,fpe6rea,t1_fpdzy81,1588541477.0,"If you solely want to experience that moment of validation for the dopamine kick, just to feel what it's like, you can just do what the majority of conventionally beautiful and popular people on IG are doing - edit the hell out of your own photo. Fire it off into the aether, watch the likes roll in and find that the validation and the attention change nothing and it does not fix the dysmorphia. If anything, it'll be worse for it. But it'll also be a truthful experience in the sense that everyone there is faking it to some extent, and the only real way to stop feeling that misery is through therapy and self-acceptance."
BodyDysmorphia,fpe5dyr,t1_fpe4l39,1588540684.0,"Sure, if it helps. I also have dysmorphia, but consciously staying away from IG and tiktok and being over 30 has helped keep a level of rationality and coping when it comes to this stuff."
BodyDysmorphia,fpdoygk,t3_gcvcf1,1588531311.0,"That type of physical desirability is extremely temporary and fleeting, and comes with a lot of negatives. It takes a ton of time, money and effort to create and maintain, time that you should probably rather be using to work on yourself in ways that create lifelong improvement and personal growth. People on Instagram also only show you extremely curated and edited snippets of their life and present a fantasy, not a reality where they still have lumpy fleshy imperfect bodies that have bad days and get sick and depressed and anxious.

Being hot has an expiration date and the dopamine kick of external validation wears off. The volume of gross, nasty, invasive people who inject themselves into your life and do you emotional and physical harm purely because you're above a certain threshold of conventional attractiveness can sap all joy from it and make you feel really dehumanized. You get stalkers, impersonators. It doesn't pay off in the long run."

PlasticSurgery,fofhjbx,t3_g78ca1,1587736022.0,"Your facial features look as one would expect a normal 25 year old to look. You have very good clear skin and you might be comparing your makeup-free face to the faces of other people who do wear makeup, or to manipulated photos where natural facial anatomy is airbrushed out. If you're doing that, take some time to re-evaluate how you judge your own bare natural features compared to the extremely curated images you see of others in makeup.

If you're generally concerned with preventing skin/facial aging, wear a good sunscreen daily, pick up an AHA chemical exfoliant to renew your skin, and you can use a retinol moisturizer to prevent future wrinkle formation. Drink a lot of water. There's nothing ""aged"" or old about your facial structure."
PlasticSurgery,fofbt8c,t3_g723b1,1587732185.0,"FWIW your asymmetry is very unnoticeable and in the range of what every average person has. Our brains are hardwired to read a degree of asymmetry as natural, and absolutely symmetrical faces look artificial and uncanny to us.

But if you really really want to pursue plastic surgery, your jaw protrudes outward slightly more on your left side, and curves more inward on the right side. It could be an overdeveloped masseter muscle on the left side (normal), or a jawbone rotation (also normal), or a slghtly more developed jawbone on one side (still normal). Out of these 3, an overdeveloped masseter is the easiest and least invasive to change, as a series of botox injections will reduce the size of the muscle.

Your nose is actually very symmetrical, the nose ring might be throwing off the impression. Overall you're far from a case where plastic surgery is necessary to correct anything."

relationships,ey1y3cs,t3_cv49ka,1566715975.0,"Therapy therapy therapy. Start thinking seriously about what kind of a home environment your daughter is going to grow up in - it's going to mold her psychologically, greatly affect her sense of self and her perception of what relationships look like, and you have to choose here what kind of mental imprint you're going to leave on this human you created which will shape her whole life.

I grew up in a messy, resentful and conflict-heavy home with a constant negative and tense atmosphere, primarily because of my dad, and my parents finally broke up when i was 13. I came out of that with lifelong mental illness, severe attachment and self esteem issues, and I can't emphasize enough how much of an impact your choices here are going to have on your daughter's entire life from this point onwards.

Appreciate the gravity of what you're doing and sort this out with a great therapist. Divorce if the life ahead of you seems too unbearable, save your daughter the emotional harm of having to go through that at a time when she understands what's happening."
