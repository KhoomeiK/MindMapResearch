depression,fkwn6ir,t3_fl010g,1584597963.0,"Please don't give up! We are trying so hard on our end (therapists, more specifically, psychologists) to make sure telephone and video sessions are covered by insurance so you dont have to worry about paying for those!

I know there are crisis lines you can also use. If telephone or video therapy is not your jam, we will still be here to help once the world recovers!!! :)"
AnxietyDepression,fkps31z,t3_fjvw8c,1584417798.0,Being calm in a situation like this can be a trauma response. Just giving you the other side of the coin.
Dentistry,fi5m2nz,t1_fi5ccgy,1582165986.0,"Hey! I just want to let you know that there are psychologists specializing in pain management, and I am one myself. I would look for one as they have the training to help you cope AND help you maintain a quality of life despite the pain!"
mentalhealth,fhzkwxv,t3_f5mbxn,1582002420.0,"If you do not have a therapist, now is the time. Your wife cannot be your therapist. Your teens cannot be your therapist. They are your family, and sometimes families get burned out. That's what therapists are for. To talk to about your struggles."

Contrave,fbr79rm,t3_ee3jme,1577040002.0,This sounds counterintuitive but I know I had difficulty with this too. I would barely eat anything in the daytime because I just wasnt hungry and forgot. But make sure you are eating ENOUGH during the day so you dont get nighttime hunger.
legaladvice,fag9pvz,t1_fag9a9i,1576044958.0,I only know because I was a post doc in family medicine and was on a similar pay stipend as the resident physicians! I couldnt bill because I was not a licensed psychologist in MS during post doc.
legaladvice,fag9gli,t1_fag43yg,1576044679.0,"I would also like to mention that it is probably that expensive vs another hospital like St Doms or Baptist because UMMC is the only level 1 trauma center in the state of MS, so they can increase their costs if they want to. I recently finished my post doc work at UMMC. I also know they were building a new children's hospital when I was working there so they've got to pay for that somehow!"
legaladvice,fag864z,t1_fag43yg,1576043318.0,"You would not get billed doubly. Resident physicians are paid by stipend, and cant bill because they are not fully licensed and boarded physicians yet."
