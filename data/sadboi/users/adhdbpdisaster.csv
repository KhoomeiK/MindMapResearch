pidgeypower,fqmti1y,t3_gjjw5p,1589483265.0,"What kind of bird is she?

Pidge mainly gets around using his beak as a cane or by grabbing the bars of his cage. Getting him to move can be hard, but what I do is spread his favorite things throughout the cage. Recently, I've been working on getting him back to perching a little more. I've been clipping millet in a place he can only reach by a perch. It's close to the bars of his cage so he's safe! My point is, it's about coaxing her out by giving her a reason to come out. This is a very scary time for her, so be sure to give her lots of cuddles and comfort too! Keep us all updated <3"

pidgeypower,fpkmib0,t3_ge15l5,1588697305.0,"1. Find a toy that you can stuff things in. This a whicker ball I bought in a pack from Amazon. You can probably use old toys with holes or openings. 

2. Cut the tip off a cotton swab. Make sure you get all the cotton off so it wonâ€™t become loose! I prefer to just cut one off so it stays in the toy better, but you can make your own adjustments as needed. Also, you technically can pull all the cotton off, but I find itâ€™s hard to get everything off. Cutting is just easier to me. 

3. Stick that bad boy in with the non cotton end sticking out! Make sure the end with the cotton swab is secure inside and wonâ€™t come out easily. Always supervise your bird if you still have a cotton end that may come out!

4. Tada! Hours of fun! 

Make sure to post how it goes if you test it out! Iâ€™d love to see your birds!"

u_adhdbpdisaster,fojpi56,t3_g7ujso,1587826597.0,"As some of you know, Pidgey recently saw the vet because of his toe. It was red and inflamed and clearly very painful. It seems to have somewhat resolved after a course of anti inflammatory meds, but itâ€™s still swollen and the nail will most likely fall off. Itâ€™s the only backwards facing toe and itâ€™s starting to fall out of alignment. It seems to have lost all nerve control and will no longer wrap around or curl. It doesnâ€™t seem to be hurting him, but if that changes it may have to be amputated. He is under close observation and in good hands with his vet team, discussing possible options now. 

Still! Heâ€™s very happy, mostly communicating in squeaks, static, and some chatter. Heâ€™s molting now and gaining more flight confidence. As I am typing this he just flew out of his cage and to me. He missed, and is now screaming at me to pick him up. 

Heâ€™s been a source of joy during this pandemic and Iâ€™m glad he has spread so much cheer. Now that things are starting to improve, Iâ€™ll be decreasing posts as I know some people may be annoyed by seeing him. You can still see him on my profile and his instagram @pigeon.the.wonder.tiel. 

Other news, I will be getting my own apartment soon, which means the possibility of adopting another bird. The apartment Iâ€™m applying for has a wonderful pet policy. Pigeon loves spending time with my cousinâ€™s tiel, Lolo, so if everything goes well, I would love to adopt another special needs bird, preferably another cockatiel or similar skill level bird as Pidge is my first bird. If you know of any special needs, elderly, or otherwise in need of a loving home bird in midwestern United States, or of someone willing to travel to the midwest, do not hesitate to DM me. Iâ€™ll definitely be keeping an eye on this subredditâ€™s adoption page and on local pet rescues.
