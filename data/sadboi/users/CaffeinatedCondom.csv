They were very understanding, & let me finish without the 2 week period. About a month later, I‚Äôve developed the delusion that I‚Äôm a shamen, have magical powers. I remembered my boss named ‚ÄòOz‚Äô had mentioned to me one time asking what I thought about psychedelics for spiritual awakening since I‚Äôm a psychology major. I made the connection of his name ‚ÄòOz‚Äô purposed as being a reference to ‚Äòthe wizard of Oz‚Äô. I go to my old job, and find my boss looking for answers to everything. I think he understood I wasn‚Äôt in my right mind, because he really treated me like I wasn‚Äôt insane, but inside poor guy probably was shook. Told me, ‚Äúwho defines normal?‚Äù Came in another time & my other boss came out to say hello and ask how I‚Äôm doing, and I tell him I‚Äôm doing all better, explaining some nonsense of what my psychosis ‚Äúreally was‚Äù.. and when he looked at me in confusion I say, ‚Äújust ask Oz, he knows all about it‚Äù. He responds, ‚Äúwell okay.. glad your doing better‚Äù, and just leaves to the back to probably get away from the uncomfortable situation. At the time I thought I had knowledge to the secret answers of life, but I look back, and it‚Äôs my cringiest memory.

Also, when I had to withdrawal out of school because of the psychosis, I went off on the dean of my college about the schools mental health services being shit. When I got better I was so mortified and felt so bad I sent him a letter and cookies.

I got so delusional I was afraid to drive anywhere because every time I did I‚Äôd nearly swerve off the road from looking so much in my review mirror of the ‚Äúpeople following me‚Äù or always being paranoid about cops. Another delusion happened where I confronted the guy I was with at the time because I was sure he was cheating on me.

I told all my roommates we had some sort of bug issue and spent the day trying to figure out what type of ‚Äòbugs‚Äô any particle of dust or dirt I saw around was. That night I spent 4 hours (what felt like 20 minutes) tearing apart my skin because I could physically feel and see bugs under my skin. I had to quit my job, withdrawal from school, and go home to endure a drugged out state of antipsychotics so my brain could heal. So much crazy shit happened but it was one of the worst experiences of my life. It‚Äôs been almost a year. Also got stuck with hallucination persisting perception disorder.
