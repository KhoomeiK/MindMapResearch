Rejecting someone is never going to feel great or be easy, but you shouldn't feel guilty about it when who you're attracted to and want a relationship with is a very biological thing, it happens physically and emotionally and can also develop more and more over time as you get to know someone better, even just as friends. That attraction builds overtime, but sometimes you just know when you first meet someone or based off their profile that they are a nice person but we aren't romantically compatible. Focus on doing well in your own life and let things build naturally with people you meet out through friends or in public."

While Call of Duty is expected to release a new game every year with plenty of content throughout the year, Destiny while they were still under Activision were releasing major expansions every year to fill in the gaps between releases. Destiny 2 had only 18 months of development time until it shipped in September of 2017, absolutely disgusting considering how spread thin bungie already was working on content for Destiny 1. This has such a massive impact on the quality of the games and just makes every release from activision feel rushed out the door with monetization as bad as free to play mobile titles. This company expects and pushes annual releases out the door every year, in a vicious cycle, and it's going to hurt not only each game, but the entire brand as a whole and the development teams who are forced to stick to such tight deadlines are going to suffer for it and that fucking sucks, because Activision loves to hit those quarterly deadlines and shove aggressive monetization in everything just to make the shareholders happy. I don't think anyone at the top of the Activisions executive ladder has a clue about how to make a good and honest product, they only chase the money and will continue to do so. I just hope for the development teams sake that something drastic happens in the future, a serious change in management that will actually give a shit about the people below them, start caring about the company and the dev teams who work for them and improve the companys culture as a whole. Sadly it won't be happening in the near future at least, as Treyarch has just 2 years to make COD 2020 and that is no doubt going to affect the quality of that game and possibly the games after it, and activision will monetize the hell out of it to make up lost ground. Disgusting. Fuck Activision. Can't say it enough. Buy the games, don't support Activisions fucking bullshit. You all know what to do, don't spend a single dollar in any monetization in any of their games"
