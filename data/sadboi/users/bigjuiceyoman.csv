TwoXChromosomes,fl2qlqx,t3_flzko0,1584757418.0,"I'm a hospital worker in Australia. Theres always the talk of the brave drs ( and they are ) working through this but no one talks about nurses.. I watch them on a daily basis deal with some of the worst things you can imagine. Most nurses I have met are the most amazing people I'll ever meet I think.
Nurses ARE hospitals and I'm glad to finally see them getting the recognition they very much deserve..it's just a shame it's during this nonsense.

They're legit superheroes"
depression,fk849ir,t1_fk66tqu,1583949076.0,I deleted my Facebook account 3. Years ago and it helped more than anything. The urge to hurt myself by comparing my everyday to other people's curated and shared moments was a torture I didn't need on top of everything else. Never looked back

MentalHealthBuddies,ette3q2,t3_cd93zh,1563175260.0,"Get out and start to exercise. I know it sounds like empty advice but it really does help.

I put a heap of pressure on my poor wife, she was getting very fed up with me and my nonsense. All I did was start walking the dog to pick the kids up from school.. not a cure all but it's a start. You will start feeling better about yourself and over time things will start falling into place and start getting a bit easier. 
I'm still not ""well"" but I do feel better and less reluctant each day to face life. I still have bad days, really bad days (weeks) but a bit of intense exercise or long walk helps immensely."
gout,ettdq0h,t3_cdbwlu,1563174756.0,"Ive been flare-up free and meds free for almost 18 months.
During my last few flare-ups I just drank as much water as I can handle and took ibuprofen a few times a day.. nothing else ever worked.

All the meds were messing with me so i ditched them entirely and increased my daily water and increased my activity level... Never felt better. I have on two occasions felt the early twinge of an oncoming and just took a few ibuprofen and drank and drank and peed and peed.....but no flare-up.

Water is your best friend, friend. Drink up.

Hope you feel better."
