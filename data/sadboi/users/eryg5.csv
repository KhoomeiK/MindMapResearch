In that case, I hope it works out, one way or another. Time apart can definitely illuminate other aspects in the relationship. I feel like I have gone through something similar at the beginning of the year. Best of luck to you."
awakenedliving,fqxm1o2,t3_glhh5d,1589734387.0,"As scary as it is, setting boundaries is a sure way to get him to stop, or at the very least, to state your concerns, wants, and needs. To say, ""I don't like that joke (anymore) and I'd like you to stop,"" or something along those lines, can feel terrifying at the beginning, but it would be standing your ground, letting them know what is okay and what isn't okay with you. I struggle and am working on this myself. For me, however, that is more standing my ground than letting someone do something around me that I don't want them to do and passively ""taking it."""
