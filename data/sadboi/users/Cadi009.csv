But I do think that there's a few reasons why sparebenders is still popular on PC and not so much on console, recoil, fov, and shotgun ammo economy/ease of use being among them. And traction and the way console handles sensitivity in general are a big part of the ease of use and ammo economy discrepancies between PC and console.

PS. I do agree with your edit btw. Separating ads and hipfire accuracy on console would do wonders across the board, and a lot of inputs don't feel optimized in the slightest, jumping, dodging, sliding, and weapon swaps are key components of most gunfights but unless you've upgraded to a controller with paddles you are basically fighting the control every step of the way. Just about any time you have to take your thumb off a stick you are reducing accuracy and potentially slowing your ttk, which is another problem non existent for PC users who can pull off some pretty damn impressive acrobatics, which are impossible to replicate on console even with paddles and traction."

The only reason not to make it universal ornaments (or to not make all ornaments universal for that matter) is to limit the universal ornaments to eververse only sets.

I'm glad it's back in the game, but you'd have to be blind or a Bungie  apologist to think massively inflating the world drop pool with old gear was a genuinely better solution than making it universal."

CruciblePlaybook,fkngla9,t3_fjdxv9,1584365235.0,"My opinion as one of those people, is that while it's not as hard as it was originally. It's a much more rewarding experience to earn and how it should have been to start with. There was nothing reasonable about having to exclusively fight unbroken 3 stacks with the weapons you're trying to earn who are getting nothing out of it but ego inflation.

I have approached the comp playlist as an opportunity to learn and improve ever since I got my Luna's howl the second season it was available. The season prior, forsaken, I decided to buckle down and earn the broadsword and that was my personal initiation into becoming a crucible player. I went for Luna's because I wanted to see if I could, and because it was such an oppressive weapon at the time, I thought I needed it to do well in the crucible and crutches on it hard once I got it.

I was a ""fabled champion"" for awhile after that, going in to get the latest guns and get out, until I realized I was playing well below my bracket and wanted to see how high I could get during season of the drifter. I made it to 4500, and immediately stopped making any form of progress because every match was a shutout game, over before it began, but I kept going in and fighting unbrokens with NF's running stacked, doing carries or recovs, and it took a very long time of beating my head against the wall to realize that I was never going to progress solo, and that I needed to learn how to position myself and work with a team.

My main problem was that untill that point the only skill I had was gunskill. I would constantly over commit, push too far, and get myself into situations where I had no option but to shoot my way out against a better positioned or multiple enemies. And I got as good at that as I possibly could and that was my personal wall I tried to break down for months before it clicked that I didn't have to break down the wall, because there was a door a few steps away. I still do it sometimes, and my gunskill has definitely clutched many rounds 1v2/3 because that was my element for so long. But now I focus on my positioning, and the gunskills comes second nature. I improved.

 It took time, I peaked at 5000 near the end of season of opulence, and I never hit legend before the changes. But I have fought legend, and unbroken players in nearly every survival match solo or teamed up  since the changes, exactly as I was while above mythic in prior seasons. I've improved more and picked up skills along the way. And by the end of the month, I'll have my unbroken title to show for it. And now my sights are set on trials, and I will continue to improve, and I hope every player I run into who earned their unbroken before the changes can tell that I earned mine after, and that the lessons are fresh, and I'm going to continue to fight tooth and nail in every match."

I've never so much as equipped the majority of them ie. Python, Gambit smg, Komodo. Edgewise is ""meh"" its nice to have a heavy with demolitionist for grenade kill bounties that's about it, and Randy's just doesn't do it for me, though I do very much like the gun model and that it's unique to the kinetic slot.

Good riddance that there aren't more of the same ""7 enhancement cores redux"" weapons required for the seal I say.

But loot in general is suffering in a big way that 3 fixed drop weapons isn't going to fix. We need a vendor overhaul and we need it six months ago.

P.S. I forgot about Martyrs retribution somehow, but I deliberately excluded perfect paradox as it's a reskin.

DestinyTheGame,fiuky5o,t1_fiuiwmp,1582743371.0,"Historically during trials active periods there has been a cap on max power, attainable through PvE or PvP activity gear drops. Right now there is no limit on max power and it is directly correlated to amount of time spent grinding bounties or seasonal events, having more play time should not also give a double edged ttk advantage in what should be a skill based contest such as trials."

Winning 1v3s is a skill all it's own, and on paper it's as simple as turning a 1v3 into 3 1v1s. Some teams that's easy, they practically do it for you. Others are smarter and will kite you into a corner and push together."

FightingLion,fitqwa9,t3_f9n3iu,1582727339.0,"Practice, map knowledge, improvisation, thinking in your enemies shoes, and luck, ever corner, doorway, lane, and room is different, and you can basically think of fighting lion as a pinball in a lot of situations. If you want to get super nerdy about it then learn about vectors, but it's not really necessary since you'll be estimating, guessing, and hoping 9/10 times.

There's a few pretty easy and consistent bounce shots I use regularly, wormhavens mid lane comes to mind, you can bounce rounds off the curved wall to hit people looking through the glass easily, the glass helps a lot here and it may be a helpful place to practice as you can see your rounds after they go around the corner. Also a big part of it is feeling ranges. A favorite though high risk pastime of mine is peaking a sniper on a very long lane, firing, immediately ducking into cover and releasing the round blind, it's a three way split between aim confidence, muscle memory, and luck, also if you don't get at least a 75 tag I wouldn't even consider taking a second shot."

Democratic is used here as an adjective, because this is a republic with representatives that are democratically elected, not a democracy, by definition it cannot be a ""flawed"" democracy, because it is not a democracy.
