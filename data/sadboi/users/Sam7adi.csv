explainlikeimfive,f173nlt,t3_d802ra,1569234503.0,"Being an Indian and observing such vast diversity of religion ,casts,races etc around me I used to wonder why do people use surname.
Asking elders and doing some research led me to these few facts about Surname.
People used to have certain surname because of 

1-The area they used to live in.
A group of people living near a certain river or Mountain started identifying themselves by the name or a derivative of the name of that geographical structure.

2-The job their family and ancestors did.
It's quite common to have a surname of a certain job like blacksmith,farmer, Soldier etc

3-The God they worshipped.
People started using certain surname that was only for those who used to worship a certain Deity.

4-The Gypsys and Unknowns.
There were people who used to roam around and not associate with any group or religion or place.
They started calling themselves specific names(mostly something that sounded cool) and then there were some those who didn't have a clue where they came from so society gave them certain pronouns as surname( rude words mostly to belittle them)."

I don't know if I am the kind of person who can do things for people but I was blessed with someone who was there for me,just to hear me out or let me rant or speak my mind So I know how that feels when you feel absolutely alone and helpless.
He mentioned that nobody can help him so I wanted him to know that we can atleast listen and maybe help him out. Talking to a professional is necessary but sometimes just a single gesture like listening is enough to uplift someone."
