She would try to keep me preoccupied on her by constantly calling and video calling me, and it was getting annoying because I knew I was being rude by talking to my girlfriend on the phone while I'm supposed to be hanging out with my friends. It made me think being in a relationship was just constantly worrying about what your significant other was doing when weren't home, and it made me not want to be in a relationship for a long time because I felt like I just wasn't ready for that kind of lifestyle.

Then I meet my now girlfriend and it's just like ""okay well just be safe and text me when you get home i love u"" and it's like ??????????????"

I try to pick up the signs that lead up to me getting an anxiety attack,  eg over thinking, fidgeting, negative thoughts, etc, and try my best to stop doing them and focus on something else.This makes coping with it when it ever happens much easier. 

As for coping, I find it's helpful to try and focus on your five senses, start with determining what you see, then what you hear, then what you smell, and so on. This helps bring you back down to earth and not stuck in the clouds of your own thoughts."

depression,erwrao7,t1_erwqaqg,1561353155.0,"damn what a great read! thats exactly what ive been feeling. you're right, the first part is always the hardest part. i guess we all gotta start sonewhere right? but while i agree, i sometimes feel like im too tired, either mentally or physically, to pick up and start doing what im doing sometimes.

for example, im working a part time job, meaning im working a little less than 30 hrs a week, as well as taking classes at my community college, so sometimes when i find myself in a position where im free and able to start doing what i want to do, i waste it instead by lounging all day and playing video games, because i try to utilize as much time as possible to recharge for my next shift/class.

i find myself too tired sometimes, and i worry its more than usual. would it then be a matter of just pushing through and doing what i want to do even though i feel tired, or would there be something im missing?

anyways, thank you for the message. i was constantly checking my phone to see if anyone would share their thoughts and experiences, so even if it was quite a read, i enjoyed and appreciated it. thank you :)"
