This advice is really hard to make a reality. To make it realistic start one by one not everything at once. The change comes from you, from within. But I *guarantee* you that if you make it that you will be a completely new human who sure as fuck doesnt have depression anymore.

Wish you the best OP, your going to dig yourself out Im sure
