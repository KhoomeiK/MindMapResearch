BPD,fpw7rxs,t3_gfkdm2,1588958722.0,"That‚Äôs not only a compulsive trait of OCD, people that suffer from BPD have a black and white thinking pattern which often leads to them distancing themselves once they‚Äôve categorized someone into their ‚Äúblack‚Äù category, but I find more commonly that this behavior is brought on by our initial fight or flight mode. When we feel attacked or rejected that feeling is very uncomfortable, so the easiest thing to do would be to cut the person out of our lives and anyone associated with them. I find those of us who suffer from BPD also have an affinity to starting over with a clean slate anytime something small goes wrong, we are more comfortable starting over with a blank canvas than we are fixing the one we‚Äôve already started drawing."

BPD,fps89jv,t3_gf73f3,1588869131.0,"You need to ask yourself a few questions and you will be able to figure out whether or not this is the relationship you want to be in. 

First you need to break things down into parts, your own parts.  My parts consist of, anxiety, depression, paranoia, and control. My anxious part tells me this is all wrong, my paranoia tells me my partner is out to get me anyway, my depression tells me he‚Äôs better off without me, and my control tells me I need to distance myself emotionally so that I don‚Äôt get hurt if or when bad things do happen. (I listed these so you can have some what of an example.) 

Once you‚Äôve identified your core parts, you need to have a chat with them. Ask them what they are feeling and why. Ask what you can do to soothe them, and be compassionate with yourself. Finally you need to ask them what they really truly want. Do they feel as if they want to work through this relationship? Or does it feel too toxic to continue? 

Your next step is communication, you are unable to communicate your true feelings to someone until you are able to understand your feelings, and I‚Äôve provided you with the ability to do that with the step above. 

Speak with your partner tell them how you feel, and hear their feelings as well. Tell them without attacking them what it is that you need and if those things are not provided then it is time to leave your relationship."
BPD,fps6769,t1_fps4lg2,1588868138.0,"It is very plausible that your FP may just be busy, but that is not your issue. Finding yourself attached to someone who hasn‚Äôt attached themselves to you is very painful. Remind yourself that this is not your soul mate it is indeed the BPD telling you this might be ‚Äúthe one‚Äù. Our instincts aren‚Äôt always as correct as we want to believe they are. Find something to entertain yourself find a new friend online, play a video game. Take your mind off of this person because you absolutely can function perfectly with or without them in your life and once you realize this it will get easier to face possible rejection."
BPD,fps5alr,t3_gf8gww,1588867704.0,"Your first step here should be realizing that not everyone is able to provide you everything you need all the time, and vice-versa. We were not meant to be perfect. 

Trouble in a relationship is common, relationships are a lot of work on both parts. Do not let a bump in the road make you turn around and drive all the way back home. 

Communication is key in this aspect, that feeling of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not giving me what I need so I‚Äôm leaving‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat you said hurt me so I‚Äôm going to distance myself‚Äù is never the answer. 

You need to ask yourself what you are feeling, why you are feeling this way, and what you want the outcome to be from this. If your answer is simply I am not happy and I want to leave, leaving is the answer. If your answer is I want to fix this and work through it with my partner, then we are back to communication. Explain calmly and rationally to your partner what they did that hurt you, express your feelings and explain what they could do differently to avoid this issue again, hear their feelings as well because remember it is not only you that may be hurting right now. 

I do a lot of CBT therapy if you have any questions feel free to DM me."

A calm conversation is almost always the answer. All we‚Äôre looking for is to feel okay and secure and communication is how we get that gratification, so if you just sit and stew in your own anger it will never go away. The faster your able to stop think and communicate calmly the faster this will subside."
BPD,fpo7mvm,t1_fpo6vxi,1588779784.0,"It takes time, have you figured out what helps you come down when you feel that anger tingle? I know when I get it my whole body is overcome and it‚Äôs very hard to turn it around I start disassociating and can‚Äôt focus on anything but my negative feelings and the words that were said that hurt me. Try and call a friend, read a book, take a shower just sit there and talk to yourself about this (I do my best thinking in the shower) lol. 

Also it‚Äôs good to remind yourself that not everyone is perfect we say things we don‚Äôt mean sometimes we say something but mean something different, as well as everyone else. 

I also like to remind myself that my husband is an idiot and that sometimes helps lol"

BPD,fpo3l29,t1_fpnt6jm,1588777758.0,"Trust your instincts yes, but don‚Äôt forget having BPD puts us in a fight or flight mode when we feel attacked. Take a step back and think about what outcome you really want from this. Do you want to leave him? Or do you just want him to understand that you aren‚Äôt sad on purpose and feel better? 

This is your husband you obviously have a lot of love for him but it looks as if you‚Äôve split him into the ‚Äúbad‚Äù category because he voiced that he has an issue with you always being sad. Which is unfair for you but EVERYONE is entitled to their own feelings and opinions, he is entitled to feel that way and you are entitled to feel upset about what he said. 

Communication is key in this aspect. Before you try to communicate with him you need to center yourself, put yourself in his shoes, yes you have made progress, yes what he said was hurtful and discouraging, but DO NOT let that deter you from making progress. 

Ask yourself why you are so upset about what he said, if the answer is that you feel attacked because of how hard you have been working, console yourself and understand that you are doing this for YOU with or without him.

Ask yourself how you can explain to him that it isn‚Äôt on purpose and you‚Äôre trying but his words are discouraging without making him feel attacked for his feelings. Good luck!"
