scabies,fqw2aqg,t3_giiduk,1589690884.0,Hello! I have this same issue! And I’m fairly sure I can attribute it to my anxiety 🙃 I def thought I had scabies as well but had no visible rashes or burrows etc. I suffer from ptsd and as it is insomnia but some nights for whatever reason I too get this sensation of “skin crawling” which leads to frustration and agitation the longer it keeps me up. I’m not sure if this will help you at all but perhaps a little insight 🤷🏻‍♀️. Good luck.
scabies,fqw1ifb,t3_gjbs1v,1589690290.0,"From what I understand essential oils can kill scabies but not the eggs they lay which creates the cycle over again. I’m currently treating myself homeopathically as a precaution. My parents got it from my poor grandmother and now I am not sure if I have it or not. My boyfriend who I sleep next to every night seems to be perfectly fine. I’m waiting on a jar of neem butter which is supposedly a good alternative. I use a combination of almond oil as a base 10 drops each of clove, lavender, tea tree, and ylang ylang. I take Allegra during the day it’s 24 hour relief and I really don’t itch at all. Maybe randomly here and there but not too badly 🤷🏻‍♀️ So I’m Hoping I never had it or I did a good job of jumping on it early. I had a night 2 days ago where I didn’t sleep because I was so itchy, but I don’t really have any rash? This whole thing confuses me a lot tbh. I have had little bumps pop up here and there but they generally go away like hives and I haven’t noticed any trails."

Empaths,fnoo7yy,t3_g2weum,1587130123.0,"I don’t even know how to say that since since I’ve been a child I’ve related to music on a deeply personal level. As if I could fully understand what was trying to be portrayed via the lyrics, the emotions in the chords and melodies chosen. I am a singer and for as long as I can recall at times it gets very difficult not cry when I start to sing. The feeling eventually dissipates, but there’s a huge emotional release that happens with playing music, listening to music, writing music or lyrics. I have a hard time really describing it because I don’t feel I’m doing it justice. How one moment I can be listening to Florence and the machine and she channels a very witchy, ethereal almost, dark, moody energy and that comes through in her music if I switch to the beastie boys lol my mood will change, like completely...music can fully effect my mood if I let it...it’s unreal.

Edit: I was also in the music industry for a short, short time. I will say this...I relate to being an empath for sure. However when I was leading a band I was at the most narcissistic point in my life I’d ever been. I’ll never forget my Therpaist saying to me it requires a healthy amount of narcissism to be a professional musician because you have to not really care what other people think of you. So...to answer your inquires o/p I do not believe it is so black and white. As I got “older” I started becoming turned off by my narcissistic ways and it turned out that I appreciated my empathy more. I began to recognize my absolute NEED to perform and sing and tell all of the people what I had to say was just that...I needed to get it out...I believe THAT is what it is for a lot of musicians...we need to get it out and someone to listen."

I feel like with a man I would’ve told him to fuck off and leave me alone for some reason with a woman I felt like I needed to be conscious of her feelings?? Maybe empathizing on some level. I could also tell when I’d reject her she’d just go rub up on some poor unassuming chick the same way. So I just gathered she was desperately lonely 🤷🏻‍♀️

Edit: because I remembered ANOTHER time a woman also drunk...and again really persistent just kept coming up to me and telling me I was beautiful. I have boundary issues and feel bad telling people to leave me alone (trauma blah blah blah) and she was touching me and trying to touch my face.  Then she went in for a kiss and I promptly pushed her face away from mine and had to ask her to leave me alone..."

What I mean is usually someone is giving me the message and in the past it just appeared now there’s far more clarity. Developing this recently has been a great source of fun and fascination where as when I was a child it terrified me. I was very sensitive as a child. I am still working on trusting myself. And not getting too excited when I’m receiving messages. Because sometimes I’ll be getting something and because I’m actively trying to open things I get so excited everything closes down for a moment lol. How do you feel about “negative” energy?

It consumed me. At home, at work, even when I was with my family hanging out with them in a loving environment I had this desperate urge to end the suffering. This is temporary. Like someone else said this too shall pass and you will be stronger for it. Please don’t friend, please please don’t. 3, 4 months ago it was all I wanted and now I can’t even fathom it. It goes to prove that our minds are mailable. Please do something to destress. Fuck that therapist...they aren’t all winners but if you need someone to talk to try a new therapist or try something completely new and different. Yoga, meditation, reiki, massage, acupuncture, equine therapy?! There’s so much out there...take a walk? 

When I started recognizing that I was swimming in a sea that I created, I recognized that I too could drain the waters and start trying to walk on solid ground again. Perception is reality. Try to have hope. Fear is what’s causing you to feel this way. Have hope for your mother and your family. Hope for yourself love. Everything will be ok, no matter what because it always is.

energy_work,fkbqb55,t3_fhhofv,1584037816.0,"Have you been taking care of yourself? Do you tend to put others before yourself? We can’t pour from an empty cup. It’s time to work on YOU. Take a bath with lavender essential oil (100% medical grade) and Epsom salts, meditate, try insight timer app it’s free and has amazing guided meditations. Imagine yourself “vibrating higher” low energy and irritability is a sign that you are ignoring your well being. Try restorative or yin yoga - if you’re up for a challenge a more rigorous form of yoga could be fun like vinyasa or hatha. Crafting can be de-stressing , painting, drawing, making jewelry. Try to express yourself through words - write it out, journal, sing your favorite songs out loud. Simply put have more fun, try to find time to relax- BALANCE. Tigers eye is great but it won’t heal you, it’s only going to assist in the healing you bring to yourself. Reiki, massage, acupuncture are also wonderful to assist in moving stagnant or stale energy around. Lastly watch your thoughts, notice how you speak to yourself, how harsh is your inner critic? Hope this helps 🤷🏻‍♀️"

Pull your ribs in, pull up on your pelvis to neutralize the hips. Take you time getting into a pose I can see your excitement and that’s so freakin beautiful but be mindful...slow down just a little bit.

For example if I’ve told you I’m suffering from ptsd immediately that means I deserve compassion and empathy if I’m a dick to you...which we all know is simply not true...obviously it’s ok to be upset or angry but it’s not ok to be abusive and unfortunately I tend to be become quite indignant when folks in my life conveniently forget  I have a mental health issue and that I’m easily triggered by confrontation. 

I also have a hard time confronting people when I’m feeling like I need to get something off my chest because I assume it will turn into a fight and get ugly and that no matter what the other person is saying to me to rectify the situation that they are lying or manipulating just to appease. Usually it ends with my crying and apologizing like a lunatic and feeling confused and disoriented.

But yes saying my name to someone makes me uncomfortable too, now that you say that...🤔 I’ve never explored this notion - but your name is apart of what we consider our identity - I’m curious of this has anything to do with the icky or uncomfortable feelings.

I was approached by a sex trafficker in a mall in Florida. 

At the time I was working retail at a luxury store in the mall and was on a break walking around when a man approached me - he grabbed my hand and acted as if he were hitting on me telling me I was very beautiful - my stomach just dropped because something seemed off about how he came out of no where I was simply standing in the mall and he parted a sea of people and was suddenly in front of me, invading my space. I told him I had a boyfriend I wasn’t interested - chalked up to a language barrier and ethnical differences. I walked into the store I work in and then my friend and coworker says the same man approached her and said the exact same things to her as he had said to me...

Shortly there after that coincidence...the police show up, and ask if we’ve been approached by or seen this man...this man being...you guessed it said dude who has approached myself and my co-worker. The officer says he apparently followed a young woman to a store who’s mother was waiting for her, the young lady told her mother she was being followed who then told the manager of the store who called security who subsequently called the police....he was or maybe still is a known and wanted sex trafficker...😳"

ptsd,fhov6lh,t3_f44qcr,1581774934.0,Currently going through this...Every little thing that every person does makes me want to lose my mind and it’s painful because as several people have stated KNOWING that it’s the CPTSD and not my “norm” Per-se maybe harder then raging itself. Then I just get sad and more pissed off at myself for not being normal.
AskAstrologers,fhkls1q,t3_f3q1ew,1581686517.0,I have a ton of fire in my chart and not a lot of water at all and I’m actually allergic to salt water and break out into hives when I go in the ocean. I’ve always wondered if it was because of the lack of water in my chart 🤷🏻‍♀️

ptsd,fhe6s7a,t1_fhdut20,1581515282.0,"The book “the body keeps the score” details how the brain physically changes because of PTSD. It’s a really good read, check it out. Maybe available in audiobook too."
ptsd,fhe6n1w,t3_f2oh0g,1581515169.0,"I noticed improvements to my overall mental clarity when i was partaking in somatic therapy. Your brain is burdened by constantly reliving your trauma and cannot put energy into anything else. Therapy can help you to release your trauma/traumas so that your brain can start to focus on its “normal” functioning and not on trying or attempting to heal your trauma by forcing you to relive it over and over again through sensation, flashbacks, hypervigilance etc...Meditation and yoga can be very helpful to take an observational stand point vs partaking in the chaos that is our mind."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fhbf3t1,t3_f27di5,1581440994.0,"I’ve been NC for 3 years - feel free to reach out! In those 3 years I broke free from that feeling of “stuckness” and was able to cultivate a career for myself as well as become far more independent. I’ve improved my finances as well! It was not easy at first. My self worth- what little was even left plummeted. The first year I was NC I was living with my parents to save money and to feel safe honestly. After that I moved out and was on my own and slowly made strides one day at a time. Go slow and don’t feel challenged when you have a bad day because believe me when a i say they are going to happen, but it’s ok to not be ok. I have PTSD like symptoms or possibly have ptsd - because of all that I went through with my NEX. Flashbacks, Hypervigilance, mood swings, disassociation...the experience you go through with a narcissist can be traumatizing so go slow. Don’t pressure yourself to date if you aren’t ready - I have realized that we need to heal before we enter the dating world and start projecting our abuse on to potential would be suitors...my current partner is incredibly patient with me but there are times when I cannot discern that he isn’t my ex...catch my drift? It is a direct result of abuse and that isn’t fair to him. I know you asked for happy encouraging uplifting stories...I guess I don’t sugarcoat...it will get better, just slowly and if you allow it. Try out yoga or meditation or both. Therapy has helped me A LOT. Somatic therapy specifically. Wishing you the best of luck, hugs if you’ll have them!"
ptsd,fhbd9k2,t3_f23y2p,1581439905.0,"I haven’t read everyone else’s responses so forgive me if this has already been said: I think it’s really really imperative to reword how we talk about our past and who we are pertaining to our trauma. I think about the person I was...vs who I am now, and I simply cannot compare the 2...I’ll never ever be that person again and there for I cannot “recover” back to that state of mind or to that state of being...instead I am working towards becoming a new me...a new more content me...we reinvent ourselves a millions times over in our lives, why not consider this just another one of those times? Let go of old you...or the thought of a person who doesn’t exist and get excited about getting to know the new you."
insomnia,fhbcr60,t1_fhaltmp,1581439602.0,Yeah you probably still need more sleep...you’ve got to be incredibly deprived if you managed to get a good few hours in and are still it feeling rested. Ever have a sleep study done?
yoga,fh9t414,t1_fh9pz0c,1581388984.0,Pressing your hands deep into the earth is going  to help you engage your upper body strength and “push” you away from the floor. Remember to engage your Bandas. Pull your navel into your spine - pull up on your pelvic floor. Look forward - not down where your eyes go is where your body goes...strong legs engage from your glutes all the way to your toes. Think of this pose like a fulcrum or like a seesaw - if your face is too close to the floor (and you are able to bring the feet off the floor) too much weight is going forward.
insomnia,fh2kxep,t1_fh1sxzt,1581256489.0,Thank you!! I’ve experienced quite a bit of random different kinds of trauma ranging from violent accidents to sexual trauma and I’m not sure what specifically causes what symptoms so to speak. So I appreciate this.
yoga,fgyrgf3,t3_f0rl8n,1581186242.0,Such nice core engagement 👏👏👏 really impressive movement practice - are you on Instagram o/p?
Ghoststories,fgse5f7,t1_fgrnsuy,1581081818.0,"In regards to a poltergeist - yes- but it isn’t something you would do knowingly, or consciously."

yoga,fgppouo,t1_fgpbbn8,1581009581.0,"Yes! 🙌 this so much this!! Chaturanga dandasana is one of the most advanced postures in yoga asana and if you can’t hold it for at least three breaths - you might try to hold a plank pose to work towards the necessary core, arm, and leg strength to work towards it. We can also modify chatarunga by bringing the knees down to the floor from plank, shifting your shoulders SLIGHTLY past your wrists,  pulling your  navel into your spine and up on your pelvic floor - arms 90 degrees and tightly to the body."
yoga,fgpokxv,t3_ezszxm,1581008952.0,"Be humble! Listen to your body. Slow down. Breathe. Just because you can doesn’t mean you should. Use blocks - use straps - use all of the props to help you deepen your practice. Bend your damn knees. If you practice vinyasa/Hatha/Ashtanga counter and balance with restorative and yin. Listen to your teachers, they aren’t insulting you they are trying to help you."
Ghoststories,fgpjx35,t1_fgov32e,1581006290.0,I’ve heard - take this with a grain of salt because I’m not sure how true this is - poltergeists are a manifestation of our energy. “Repressed psychic energy” the entity has been created by the mind of a person in distress.  Where as a “ghost”  - there are lots of theories on what ghosts are but essentially the spirit or residue of someone who has passed on.
Ghoststories,fgpj6nd,t1_fgok7ps,1581005860.0,😳 I distinctly remember being in bed as a child and someone whispering my name with force directly into my ear...I could feel the energy behind it...i will never forget that. I slept with the lights on with a blanket over my head for years after that.

insomnia,fgm8468,t1_fgm2y2f,1580919738.0,Trauma in your sleep?! Meaning what exactly?! Sorry I’m suddenly terrified for myself Lolol because I’ve had this same issue for at least 10 years...obviously every persons situation is unique but my sleep is very anxiety ridden-I can fall asleep but cannot stay asleep and basically sleep in 2-4 hour increments...I have a had a lot of trauma in my life that I’m aware of but would I know of something that happened to me while I was sleeping? Not to be too personal but are you aware of trauma that has occurred while you were asleep? Could this be a misfiring of the brain due to trauma? Ugh down the rabbit hole I go....
Anxietyhelp,fgfvqrx,t3_ey2d4q,1580748667.0,Your first misstep is thinking everyone else has it together and then comparing yourself to said illusion. Everyone out here a mess.

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fg019xe,t3_evxxop,1580397979.0,"There was a theory exactly about what you are saying! That essentially it wasn’t the end of the physical world but it was a big energetic shift that started a time of separation, chaos, and upheaval amongst people. Have you noticed this period of “awakening”?  That people have started to become more sensitive to not just the needs of the planet but one another - we have become attune to the damage we’ve done to our planet and each other. Then you have the actually things that’s are happening - fires, disease, huge earthquakes, mammoth hurricanes, flooding...etc if we lived in biblical times - this would be considered some retribution for our sins type shit...and it feels that way doesn’t it? 2012 opened a portal - some chose to be open to the idea of being called to their true purpose - where as others ignored their gut instinct and remain on autopilot blissfully ignoring the destruction of our planet and our existence. 2012 was a warning to pay attention to is going to happen next...what is happening now."
