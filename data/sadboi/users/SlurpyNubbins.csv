dryalcoholics,fr09olp,t3_glooul,1589788124.0,"I tapered from 1L of vodka a day in 4 days (this last time), but it’s hell to go through. I definitely recommend taking a longer time to do it if you have the patience and enough time. Whatever you do, as long as your subtracting drinks and not adding more, you’re on the right track. The detox schedule I’ve used other times would go something like 1 standard drink per hour the first day, every 2 hours the next, 3 hours the next, etc... you can take that and adjust the times a bit to speed it up or slow it down if you need. As for drugs, benzos are what they use in rehab (usually vallium). Klonopin is what I would use if I could ever get my hands on any, but as far as the amounts you should take I couldn’t help you out. Just don’t take benzos and drink at the same time as the both affect your GABA receptors (hence why they ease WDs). Fair warning though, benzos are highly addictive as well, so you might want to stick to tapering with alcohol.

Edit: you can also DM me if you have a question, I don’t know how fast I’ll reply, but I’ll get back to you whenever I check my Reddit."

I’m on day 9, maybe 10 (I try not to count the days, it just makes me want a drink) since my last drink and I feel like a new man now. Around day 5 is when I got my appetite back and I must have consumed at least a weeks worth of food in less than 24 hours that day. The one thing that helped me the most was tons of vitamin B complex, and Magnesium supplements. The worst part of the detox was the lack of sleep and my kidneys were all fucked up (that’s what made me quit).
