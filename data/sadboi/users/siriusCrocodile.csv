There is overwhelming evidence at this point of immunity to secondary infection in the time frames we're talking about, based both on our knowledge of similar coronaviruses and the fact that there hasn't been a single confirmed report of reinfection, something we would almost certainly have seen by now if immunity wasn't being granted.

The only real question is how long immunity might last (which based on coronaviruses in general will be at least a couple years, although the evidence for this is certainly weaker).

Yes if you literally count someone 80% of people would prefer *not* to win and give them the victory over the people they *would* want to win, then they are the ""clear winner"". But it's also pretty damn obvious they *shouldn't* be, I would think? You're making it so 80% of the population is effectively unrepresented, which seems much worse than 60% of the population not be represented. If that's the result your Majority Judgement would produce, I'm no longer all that happy with it.

But RCV has minimal strategic voting in edge cases where voters have perfect information and perfect confidence. Approval voting has strategic voting as a concern in *literally every single election*, since withholding your vote from Centrist candidates is the only way your preferred candidate ever has a chance to win.

You're literally solving the problem of voters not voting for the candidate they actually want by making it more difficult for the candidates they actually want to win? That doesn't seem off to you?

> And besides, on the Condorcet point, if C would beat B in a head to head election, and then A jumps in the election and now B wins, that's weird.

So what if it's weird? The question should whether it produces better outcomes, healthier democracy, and a more informed populace supporting better candidates.

>  people should be aware of the shortcomings of the system and use this information to inform what the next step should be.

If people want to do next steps, they should focus on important problems like influence consolidation and switch to an MMP or some other multi-winner system.

I know you didn't ask, but if we're dreaming about some perfect system:

My preferred system system is a multi-winner threshhold system with weighted victories - at least for legislatures. Simply, clean, easy to understand. Go out and rank your choices for candidates, statewide. Anyone who gets more than 1% of the vote wins, and when they vote they vote for legislation they don't vote directly but rather vote on behalf of their supporters. So you might have one legislator with a 10pt vote, a bunch with 1pt votes, and several in between.

This maximizes the number of people who get their first choice into the actual legislature and representing their constituents and voting on actual legislation. It reduces ""wasted"" votes in a way none of the systems we've discussed so far do.

And wasted votes are far more serious a problem than strategic voting, imo. And instead of the resulting legislature being a bunch of centrists that please only 20% of the population having 100% of the vote, you get diversity at the legislative level."

> A good system should elect someone who wins 100% of top 2 choices, not 51%, at least I think so.

The ""second choice"" in your scenario could easily be someone 80% of the population despises. And you'd rather they win, over someone a plurality, 40%, of the population positively supports, and an additional 11% finds better than the alternative.

I strongly disagree. Why should we prioritize unpopular at best, maybe inoffensive, probably largely unknown, and most likely ""I don't hate this guy quite as much as the other guy"" candidates over ones that can actually manage to get the support of the majority of the population in an RCV situation?

I'm also struggling to see strategic voting actually happening in your scenario. In order for it to happen, you'd have to convince, what... a solid 15% of voters that despite their candidate only being a single percentage point swing behind the other candidate, they should support someone they want less, possibly *significantly* less, instead of trying to GOTV, giving up any chance of victory? And in this worst-case scenario you think is bad, the candidate you think should win anyway is the one who takes it! It's... a confusing argument, to say the least, when you're simultaneously saying ""this would result in this bad outcome, but also the bad outcome is the good outcome, really!"". It sounds like in its worse case scenario of extreme strategic voting RCV can at best collapse into producing the outcomes you claim to want?

Ultimately, all this alternative-voting-method seems to end up not as someone genuinely caring about a healthy democracy, but as a transparent ploy to undermine democratic majorities and weaken vision-based government to get centrists elected - and it's funny you call them centrists, since centrists are, you know, an actual ideology and not just some neutral position between left and right.

Obviously this doesn't apply to everyone in the group, but it's the group that contains the majority of the folks opposed and the majority of the group is opposed."

Really tired of this bullshit. He's absolutely not. Gore was more progressive than Biden.

Biden is also a pragmatist who is good at politics. The party *itself* is the most progressive it's ever been, which means Biden will support stuff like this even if he's not a progressive himself."

His wife's not going to get fired for working slowly or ineffectively, and probably isn't doing any labour necessitating being well rested if its their only child. (an infant is a lot of work, but luckily for me and all of us who've had to take care of infant for the first several months, it's work that's actually pretty hard to fuck up when sleep deprived).

So yeah, it's expected the person taking care of the kid be sleep deprived, and that's not an acceptable state for someone working a job that requires them to be awake and aware to actually work."
