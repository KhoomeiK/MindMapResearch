SuicideWatch,fd3yury,t3_ejysqk,1578162861.0,This is exactly how I feel. I just cannot believe this is my life and I just want to disappear
SuicideWatch,fc3wb2s,t3_eg26es,1577400282.0,Maybe just wait and see what happens tomorrow. If nothing happens tomorrow wait to see what happens the next day and the day after that. Might not be the most helpful advice but that’s how I get through my feelings. Hope this helps
