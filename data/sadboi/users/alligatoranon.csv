While I was being groomed by my ex, I dropped all of my friends, stopped talking to my family, stopped going to therapy, and made myself emotional unavailable to anyone but him. I remember love bombing very well and being told I would be his future wife, that high school friends don't usually last and that my family didn't care about me---but it didn't matter because I had him. At the end of our relationship, I made one friend and she invited me into her life and I'm healing all of the broken relationships I can now. I have a lot of friends that I know I can ask for help from, my family--- though we're distant I can go to them, my new therapist, my new boyfriend, lots of outlets for support and I'm so thankful.

I'm still not entirely sure what makes PTSD PTSD. I have certain triggers that will immediately send me into a panic attack, I struggle with opening up to people, I have nightmares that wake me up, I struggle with ""rewiring"" my brain that not everyone is hateful, mean, and selfish. There's a lot of symptoms, but I just don't feel my truama is bad enough to give me PTSD. I never saw anything like someone being mudered in front of me and no one tried to kill me. All of my truama comes from having to go through so much emotional pain alone."

ptsd,fjzsh1s,t1_fjzf1rg,1583727975.0,"Since this is top comment ill respond to this one, I think the most important thing for me to say is that I have been going through mental health help for a very long time. I was tested positive for depression and anxiety when I was 9 so physiatry has been in my life for a long time lol. I took [this test](https://safeharborhouse.com/resources/ptsd-self-test/) and got a 46 but I'm not completely on board cause it's an online test haha. I worry about asking my doctor now to reevaluate me for PTSD but I worry that my trauma isn't PTSD ""worthy"". I also don't know if the most recent thing is what gave me my PTSD symptoms. Is it possible to have PTSD from just having a really shitty life ?

TRIGGER WARNING

I really felt what u/iliveinstress had to say and my most recent ex is what made me look into PTSD. My ex groomed me for a year making me feel like he was all I had and then for a year and a half abused me. Pressuring me into sexual things, ignoring me when I would have panic attacks and when I was at the hospital for said panic attacks, hanging up on me when I called saying I wanted to commit suicide. I remember very clearing having my car set up for carbon monoxide and calling him saying I didn't want to be alone and being hung up on. The worst thing is, I still struggle with if he ""loved"" me. Maybe I'm still heavily groomed, but I sorta think he actually loved me--- but in his own fucked up kind of way. 

END TRIGGER WARNING

Anyway, my original post was about being a bad person in a bad situation. I know that putting that much pressure on someone with suicide is an awful thing to do, but I honestly felt I had no one else to help me. I would call hotlines and the people would be rude to me because I made it sound like I wasn't in crisis since my ex made me really...passive. I did bad things like getting into my ex's accounts so he would talk to me because I needed someone ((specifically him because in my fucked up world he was all I had)). I would respond with one word responses like ""okay"" and ""yes sir"" not because he would yell at me, but because I felt like it was always going to be like that. I find it difficult talking about my emotional abuse from him because I hear myself and I think, ""well you were the one doing all those awful things--- you're obviously the bad guy"". Maybe that's just more of the leftover manipulation and grooming stuck in my head."
