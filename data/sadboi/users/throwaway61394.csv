TrueOffMyChest,fm88583,t1_fm87k8f,1585844588.0,In that case he'll definitely die because he's threatened my life several times
SuicideWatch,fjil5jp,t1_fjikfwe,1583370048.0,I did. I sent him a long message telling him how I felt. That's why he told me to get over it today.
SuicideWatch,fjik79i,t1_fjij6du,1583369455.0,I'm only a few years older than you. 23. He keeps saying he loves me but then makes me feel like I don't matter or that I'm just some annoying bitch. He says he's stressed out and then shuts down and gets really mean. He's done a lot of cold heartless things to me. Today he told me that I need to get over everything his dad did to me (including multiple death threats and constant abuse) because his dad will always be in a huge part of his life. I feel really worthless.
SuicideWatch,fjiik0j,t1_fjg1103,1583368411.0,Same. I've been treated like shit my whole life. I want everyone to know how much they hurt me.
SuicideWatch,fjiiei7,t1_fjii586,1583368312.0,"My life looks perfect from the outside. Handsome husband, cute step son, nice house. But it's all bullshit. I don't think my husband even likes me. And my stepson is four, he's young enough to forget me if I died. 

I'm so tired of trying. I'm exhausted and I hate being alive."
offmychest,fh1xxwq,t1_fh1xpiv,1581227719.0,Itâ€™s more like he goes and plays poker with his friends and they all convince each other to play a second game. That happens twice a month. That with the tournament he decided to go to that was almost $100 on its own.
Parenting,fgo779t,t1_fgms4rq,1580961476.0,He wonâ€™t budge. He keeps saying over and over that he wants him to stay there for a night every week. I donâ€™t understand. Being a stepparent fucking sucks.
Parenting,fgmdw6h,t1_fgmau18,1580922652.0,"Youâ€™re right. I really want him to spend most of his time with us. I want him us to be his main caregivers and I actually thought that would happen when we got the house. I wasnâ€™t expecting all this from my in laws. 

It does. I know it hurts him a lot. That could be a whole other post. I donâ€™t know what to do to help him, but I try to make sure heâ€™s happy and healthy when he stays with us."
SuicideWatch,fggnmke,t1_fggm9lz,1580765611.0,Same. I feel like my whole life is a huge waste of time. All I ever do is make everyones life worse.
SuicideWatch,fggm3n7,t3_eye4ve,1580764714.0,Me too. Itâ€™s a lot harder than it seems. I wish I could just press a button and end it.
SuicideWatch,fakj62u,t1_fakiwey,1576168025.0,Youâ€™re right
SuicideWatch,fakini4,t1_fakiaux,1576167780.0,"I donâ€™t know. I thought there were things that made me happy. But the reality is that everything is just awful and Iâ€™ve been lying to myself. Right now, I feel completely empty."
SuicideWatch,faki6yw,t1_fakhyow,1576167560.0,Why do people have to be so awful?
SuicideWatch,fakhqoo,t1_fajchaq,1576167345.0,Committing suicide is way more difficult than most people think
SuicideWatch,fakhjgr,t1_faji5pu,1576167245.0,"I donâ€™t know if you read the first post, but the house is done and FIL still wonâ€™t move out. Everything is done except the cable isnt hooked up. My boyfriend is refusing to stand up to his dad. I havenâ€™t seen my stepson for more than five minutes in over a month. My boyfriend doesnâ€™t care. He loves his dad more than anyone in the world even though his dad doesnâ€™t even like him.

Right now heâ€™s ignoring me. Wonâ€™t respond to my messages and wonâ€™t pick up the phone. Because all of this is my fault somehow.

I feel so worthless"

relationships,f75po0o,t1_f75pb54,1573417782.0,He does go to therapy and has been making a lot of progress
relationships,f75p3jc,t1_f75mpys,1573417612.0,Heâ€™s not always like this. Things have been really good lately. I donâ€™t know why heâ€™s lashing out like this right now
relationships,f75otj4,t1_f75myln,1573417525.0,He says that theyâ€™ve all hated him his whole life and always told him that heâ€™d amount to nothing. I also found out recently that his brothers used to openly beat him and neither of his parents tried to stop it. He also says that a lot of them are worthless drug addicts. Always saying that he canâ€™t wait to get away from them
trashy,f5ubj2g,t1_f5u9vty,1572470955.0,"When my stepson was two we brought him over for a little bit and at one point he ran into their room and I had to get him out.

That shit is the stuff of nightmares. I canâ€™t imagine how any human being could live like that."

Weâ€™re trying to get them to move out. The house theyâ€™re supposed to be moving in to is still being worked on.

The construction worker hasnâ€™t been showing up to work for the past two months. FIL kept saying that he was regularly talking to the realtor selling us the house. He was lying. Last week boyfriend and I went to talk to the realtor ourselves and found out the truth. FIL gave them a list of the stuff they want in the house. Realtor said that stuff was too expensive and he didnâ€™t want to get it without a down payment. Now the house is almost done."

trashy,f5u015s,t1_f5tzl5y,1572466665.0,Me neither. Be grateful you canâ€™t smell this picture though. Itâ€™s A LOT worse in person.
offmychest,f3gjine,t1_f3ggtvv,1570912086.0,"At this point it would be better to wait for the house to be done. Itâ€™s possible that this time next year my boyfriend will be able to cut ties with his dad completely. Going to court to would just drag things out.

Hopefully in the next couple weeks theyâ€™ll be out of our house, and in the next year or so theyâ€™ll be out of our lives."
offmychest,f3g9cyu,t1_f3g89ck,1570908789.0,"And dude, you have no idea how good it feels to hear someone else call him an asshole. My boyfriend stands up for me but refuses to talk badly about his dad. I feel like iâ€™m losing my mind."
offmychest,f3g8oxl,t1_f3g89ck,1570908622.0,Theyâ€™ve already called the cops on us and lied saying that we attacked them. I want this nightmare to end.
