Im asking if you’ve ever experienced what it feels like to be a non white, or immigrant in America. 

I’ve been getting racist remarks slung at me since I was a toddler. Literally, a toddler, I distinctly remember quitting ballet at 5 because the teacher was so racist, and had to let me know what she thought of a black girl in ballet. I’m 18, now, and I’ve been banned from a hair shop for the owner not wanting to do my type of hair (as well as yelled at, and having my scalp burnt), kicked out of of thrift shop, and had newspapers thrown at me, and being called dirty by a woman at the register, while I was peacefully shopping, and so many things, I can’t even tell you. And I know people who have experienced so much worse as immigrants. 


Thank you for being respectful, though, I’ve had so many arguments with people who have half a brain cell online."
