anime,f74vrjg,t1_f74njjt,1573408752.0,">Actually nope. 1 episode of an asspull is what made it popular not a while arc or even a whole season. Just 1 episode.

Ah dude, before this anime blew up, it's already popular. The manga is very popular and when it got an anime announcement, it started getting attention. Before this show aired, it's already highly anticipated because ufotable, LiSa, and Yuki Kajiura. Big names in industry. And the show didn't disappoint, the quality is solid from start and Ep 19 somehow trend worlwide which makes what it is now. So yeah, it's fairly popular since Ep 1.

And to be fair, Tanjiro having Dance of Fire God is foreshadowed so it's not really an asspull. First, it was revealed in the first episode that his family's business is selling firewoods. And when Haganezuka first meet him, he refer to him as ""The Child of Burning Crimson."" Nezuko's Blood Art isn't really an asspull, he's a demon created by Muzan, afterall. Though, her awakening it in the middle of the fight can be taken as Awakening or Asspull, take it however you like.

>I still don't see why it's ranked 8.9 yet.

Because people can rank it however they want, duh. The fact that it's high is just saying that well, they like it and they are amazed by it. You can give it 1 or 2 and no one will mind.

>It's wrong when it brings nothing new to the table. It would be good if his personality trait led to him unable to kill a certain demon or something, but not claiming to be merciful and killing them anyways just like any other demon slayer. Same problem with MHA in first seasons. Deku is protrayed as an awkward kid who is not really confident with himself, but when something happens he suddenly knows what to do and his legs move on it's on. His personality flaw served no purpose to major events

And so....? Demon Slayer is not a revolutionary shounen, as I said. It's simple and follows the basic formula and it's good at doing that. And yeah, Tanjiro empathizes with demons but he will not forgive them for killing other people. He's not like other Demon Slayers, other Demon Slayers has no Nezuko with them which made them have second thoughts that there are other decent demon there (they never even meet Tamayo or Yushiro). Other Demon Slayers just went straight to kill, but Tanjiro will do kill them but he still respect them as they are former human like him, I think it was best shown when he fought Kyogai and Rui. He will definitely kill both of them for their heinous crimes but he will symphatise with them as they are fallen humans, after all. 

And regarding Deku, just a short explanation. Instinct and innate heroism. 

>Yet the two demons trying to find her a cure are normal so are many other demons who don't act like 1 year olds. Ok. Also, she is pretty self aware so it's not like her mind is fucked up

Tamayo and Yushiro are hundred year old demons, they've adjusted already while Nezuko is a demon for only two years.

>Maybe it's too early to decide but so far i really don't see anything intresting about them.

Well, it's your opinion and I don't mind that, you can hate them or love them. No one will hate you, I think.

>Yeah, but it's still over hyped. Like 8.9 on MAL? That's few points away from hxh and only on it's first season.

And so what? KNY literally beats One Piece manga sales this year and no one's really complaining (okay, maybe few). HxH is still a better show, anyways. 

KNY is just successful this year. Kind of funny when a more overrated MHA (don't argue) didn't make it to Top 20 despite having three seasons while KNY did that in one season. Lmao."

anime,f74m59e,t3_ducbxf,1573404536.0,"It's already popular to begin with, it's just got TOO popular and that what makes it overrated. It's also happens to a lot of anime there, no surprises.

And I don't know about you the story is decent, it's a simple show and it's good at being what it is, being simple, I don't see that as a bad trait.

And regarding characters, what's wrong Tanjiro being sympathetic and killing them anyways? He knows demons made shit stuffs but at the same time, he knows demons are fucked up people. Basically, he understands the demons' grief but its his job to kill them and he needs to deliver justice. He's basically a walking ""mercy killer."" Nothing's wrong with that.

Nezuko acts like a kid because her brain got messed up because uh... she got demonized and losing some parts of your humanity is one of the results... that concept has been thrown the show a lot so I don't know why you miss that and then complain about her personality when it's explained... And dude, hating popular characters is also dumb. Let enjoy people fanart and Nezuko is not the best girl, it's Kanroji.

And yes, Zenitsu and Inosuke are humorous characters, but doesn't mean they are just that, they're still a pretty solid character with their own personalities and motivations. Dismissing them just as comedic relief is just dumb.

Don't be an elitist here, some people watch anime to be entertained and have some fun (which makes SAO still popular 'cause even it's whack, it's enjoyable), not everyone needs to read stories with Haruki Murakami-level, or Togashi's level of storytelling.

I feel like a lot of people like you who think they great because ""Bitch, I read complex and hard stories"" needs to chill and let people enjoy what they want.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: It's a popular show that got even way more popular . Amazing series in general. And don't tell people what to do, let them enjoy whatever the fuck they want."

The four continent - Northern North Continent, Eastern Continent, West Continent, and Northern West Continent - which totally dwarfed the fifth continent, Southern Middle Continent. All of them are ruled by most powerful people which has control over a hundred nations, they are the second strongest group of people next to the mythical Clan of Family. All of them rose to power after the Familial War between the Clan of Family and the Crepuscular Sovereign which lasted three years.

With their power, they conquered a continent, formed their own government and ruled it for the next 20 years. Their influence is so big that they change how the world works, which mostly to please them as angering them equal destruction and death.

Northern North continent is very religious where they praise a certain god by the form of human sacrifice, it mostly has the Middle Ages vibes, with cavalries, kingdoms, and Colosseum.

Eastern Continent is a military continent with very serious atmosphere, they hate outsiders and only care about themselves. They believe in power over everything. Inspired to Eastern countries like China, Japan, and South Korea with their historical stuffs.

Western Continent is very modern, with buildings, transportation, and machinery. They're 100 years ahead of everyone else when it come to technology and their culture is pretty much similar to us. They are First World type countries. (They're not futuristic where there are human robots and flying cars.)

Northern West Continent is anything fantasy you can think of. This country is peak fantasy, it's like when you take Sakimori's art and make a country out of it. Very majestic.

Then there's the Southern Middle Continent which is pretty much basic, like us. Any actions of any of those will make them wary and cautious as they're not that powerful to fight any of them. Any time, any of them can conquer them giving birth to the greatest empire of all."

Becoming one of them means he will be close to the Clan of Family which are considered to be strongest group of people in the planet and living on the Realm, as Gods.

He basically want to be god because he can be limitless.

I won't exactly call it justified, since his primary motives is being jealous of people being powerful than him and being higher than him, he basically has inferiority complex."

The Southern Middle Continent is an aristocracy, only three noble individuals has complete control to the country, though they have senators, it's most likely to preserve piece and order. They are all top tier fighters as well.

The Northern North Continent is both kleptocracy and theocracy, there's one ruler and he has the only who can make a rule, in this case, an Emperor.

The Western Continent is oligarchy where only six people has power for everything, although among them the President is the highest, all the other five has their own political party, though their ideals will never contradict to the President.

The Northen West Continent is a monarchy, unlike other political system, this continent isn't the strictest when it comes to rules, despite being monarchy. The ruler here is an Empress where the people revered her as God, they're not theocracy, by the way.

The Eastern Continent is an absolute totalitarianism. They reject outsiders and very secretive, they're ruled by a King.
