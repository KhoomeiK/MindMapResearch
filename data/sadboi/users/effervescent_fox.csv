we're not all special. not everyone can be president. but all work is important, or else society couldn't function.

It happened at summer camp, and the underpaid teenage staff had NO clue what to do with a kid crying and holding a chunk of his bleeding finger, so they sorta just rushed me around the complex looking for someone who knew what to do, while i left a trail of blood behind me

I remember once they finally got me to an adult who called 911 and my parents. He gave me a cup of ice and told me to put the ice **directly** on my open bleeding wound. Ouch. Still not entirely sure that’s a good idea to do

Later at the hospital, i had to literally be physically restrained and forced to look away as they stabbed this gigantic numbing needle DIRECTLY INTO THE OPEN FINGER WOUND. And then the asshole doctor decided to start stitching me up before the numbing stuff had a chance to kick in..

they can’t legally share anything that you tell them with anyone, except for if you’re trying to physically harm yourself or others (though i would still ask him/her to explain exactly what the rules are for things they have to report, just to be safe)

so give it a try, there’s not a ton you’ve got to lose. worst case scenario is that you find it’s just going to be too uncomfortable for you, so you simply don’t go back. and remember that you don’t have to lay out all your deepest darkest fears and insecurities on the first day either. its entirely under your control for how much you want to share or talk about"

If you haven't already done these things, I'd suggest investing in some conditioner for the shower, and leave-in conditioner for when you get out of the shower and your hair is still damp

You also want to avoid vigorously towel drying your hair (idk if you do that, but a lot of guys do since it's easy for short hair, but can damage longer hair). Instead, try to squeeze the water out of your hair with a towel, and then let it air dry naturally as much as you can. If you need to dry it quicker, get a decent hair dryer and go at your hair with it on high heat, low speed. Patience is key here

It's expected that he'll screw up and accidentally say the wrong thing every now and then, but it should never be intentional or a repeating occurrence.

Over text, over the phone, in a written letter, in tears.... last i heard she said she’s with another guy now. It fucking tears my soul to shreds to think about her being intimate with someone else..... i don’t want to go on living without my second half and i don’t think I’ll ever get that back..

Thank you for your input, tonight I’ll pray that we both find what we need in life. It might not be what we want right now, but i know that we will eventually find what we need"

I was wondering, (in your eyes) is there *anything* at all that your ex could do to fix things and restore that once healthy and loving relationship to what it once was? Or is it more like, once you reach that breaking point, you’re simply done with him for good"
