Bro, I was new to it when it was at it's most toxic state. Like the ""i'm going to attempt murder just because the artist draws ship art about a ship i don't like"". No seriously, a fan literally attempted to kill a fan-artist when she was at a con, this fan handed her cookies, only for her to find out later it had needles when she ate a cookie and a needle pierced her tongue. I get it, it's a pedo ship and I'd prefer for it not to exist, but it does, so guess what? Deal with it LIKE A NORMAL PERSON.

I found out about it when I was scrolling through Tumblr, but I can't remember the post or who posted it.

Whether it's a skeleton who remembers every time you reset the game and knows no one else will remember or even know it happened, or a human child who wanted to free the one species who were actually kind to them by killing themselves and end up having their plan fail.

And the fact that you would see a part of yourself on one of these characters through similar experiences they're going through, or just how the character acts in general.

But you're aunt has the right idea. Maybe not for now, but someday, but not for the sake of your parents, but for you, everyone always has this mindset that forgiving people is for the persons sake, no, it's for you, for you to be able to move on and safely say ""I don't have to be held back by this anymore, I can live my frickin' life, they're not even *worth* my time or energy.""

Something like that. And honestly, even I can't forgive my own parents right now. But that's okay, that's just because I'm not ready yet, and that I'm still in the storm. But I acknowledge there's gonna be a time for me that I have to move on for me to live my life. But it's different for everyone.

And personally, forgiving doesn't mean you forget what the person did to you. Forgiving is you moving on, no longer being held back. But what they did can still have lasting effects on you, but that's okay, it's a good start, as long as you're moving forward, taking baby steps, if it's progress, hey it's progress.

Or maybe I'm wrong. Because this is just my perspective, and I'm honestly not even sure if I know what I'm talking about because I'm still a bridled rage of a teenager.

But either way, I pray that someday you can look back, see all the pain that was inflicted on you in it's raw form, and finally no longer being hurt by it. And you can look forward, the pain no longer there, finally free.

The times I talked about my mom who abandoned me, my brother and my dad when I was basically still 2 years old and my bro 1, and because the friend I was talking to always asked about how I'd feel if I ever saw my mom again. If I'd forgive her, if I hate her.

Tbh, I don't really know because I have mixed feelings about her. I've never met her so how do I know how I should feel about her? Do I blame her for being the reason why we're in the situation we're in? For the abuse I had to go through from the other woman my father calls her wife?

I'd just shrug. And say; ""I'll feel what I feel about her when the time comes."" But this time I paused for too long and it came off as ""I don't want to forgive her."" for some reason to her.

And she immediately went off into a speech that; ""She's your mother!"" ""No matter what happens, she's still your mom, lethxrgic!"" All that stuff.

It's tiring to hear. I know I may not be that resentful to her (yet), but that doesn't mean she has to be excused for what she's done.

Specifically the Undertale fandom (I was around when it was extremely cancer, like the peak of its toxicity, you know, when the members attacked people for trivial things like ""not sounding like Sans"", and more), I was new to it as well, I really didn't like the fandom but I loved the game.

So I stuck around for a few more years, just ignoring all the toxic people and parts of it. But then something came up, it was when someone tried to basically *murder* an artist just for *shipping* and making content of Frans (Frisk x Sans). Apparently ""she doesn't deserve to live for shipping such a disgusting ship"", at least that's just the paraphrased version.

I dislike the ship as well but I don't go as far as to try and harm someone for it! I appreciate the art, but not agree with the ship, maybe complain about it for a while, but I move on with my day.

What happened was someone gave this artist cookies(?) when she went to a convention, but the thing was the cookies (I'm just gonna call the food that) had needles in them. So when the artist ate one, thankfully, it just pierced her tongue and didn't enter her esophagus that would've cost a lot of damage and possibly her life. She posted an update that she'll no longer be accepting food or edibles from people.

I left the Undertale fandom not understanding how people would act like this towards another person no different from them, especially with a game that's literally all about peace and redeeming people. I came back around last year, and hopefully it's safe to say it's days of cancer are over. (There's still weird stuff in it oof, but there's always gonna be weird stuff in every fandom)

And don't get me started on the Steven Universe fandom, apparently some people bullied an artist for drawing Rose Quarts (a character) thin, to the point the artist killed themselves.

Probably that, I'm, I'm kinda doing better, and I'm not sure what EXACTLY she would think of me now. But I always had this fear that if my old self saw me now, she'd be sad and disappointed. And likely horrified. And I'd just look at her sadly and go: ""This isn't who we wanted to be. Sorry.""

I always thought being a teenager meant you could go outside whenever you wanted, have a group of friends you'd go and hang out with, party or something. You know, stereotypical teenage stuff because I always saw it in movies like Highschool Musical and I'd go; ""Whoa, that's how teenagers are? Cool! I wanna be like that too!""

The best thing you can do as of the moment is urge her to stop. Support her, ask her the specific reason why she's doing this, but most importantly just be there for her and take it slow. Absolutely do not force her to do anything because I am telling you it will backfire and most likely end up for the worse. Be patient with her and be gentle.

Offer to be there for her. To listen to what she has to say, why she's doing it, her specific reason of doing it. And then try your best to help her realize that hurting herself isn't the answer. That and offer harmless alternatives. Instead of focusing her frustrations/anger to herself through cutting. Help her focus it on other things.

Here are some links to websites that I pray could be of help:

 [how to help a friend who is hurting themselves](https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/friend-cuts.html)

[similar to the first link but more on what to do if you think someone you know is hurting themselves](https://www.wikihow.com/Help-Someone-Who-You-Think-Is-Cutting-Themselves)

[this one helps you, as a person who knows/think someone you know is hurting themselves, understand why they are doing it](https://www.healthyplace.com/abuse/self-injury/ill-tell-you-why-people-cut-themselves)

 [The Leena Project's Tumblr (this one is just an extra precaution, their Tumblr consists of alternatives to self-harming, alternatives that definitely avoid harm to oneself and healthy coping mechanisms, that and extra things)](https://theleenaproject.tumblr.com/reasonstolive)

 [Here's theleenaproject's post about alternatives when you feel like hurting yourself, when you feel frustrated and etc., so please show her this sometime](https://theleenaproject.tumblr.com/post/112458192951/todays-international-self-injury-awareness-day)

or perhaps urge her to talk about it with someone who is experience in the field of mental health. Like the school counselor, or find support groups online.

In example of support websites is [7 cups](https://www.7cups.com/). It's basically free counseling. And I've been actually using that platform since I was around 13. That was 3 years ago at most. And it helped me out during times of darkness. They have Listeners who you can talk to, they won't always be able to offer advices/help, but some do when they know what to do. They are there to lend an ear when you don't know who else to turn to. And the best thing about it is that you're anonymous. They're strangers, so you don't have to worry about getting judged because this person barely knows you.

I wish I could do that for my brother. I watched him get beaten up by our stepmom recently, she kept yelling at him and he was already curled into a ball, keeled over at the bottom of the staircase while crying. I couldn't do anything because I was scared of getting hurt too. I ended up crying to myself when I went upstairs because I was mad at myself for just letting that happen to him. I could've done something and I could've stopped her instead of watch her do that to him. I want to stop feeling helpless and actually do something whenever she gets angry at us/him again.

I don't want him to get hurt anymore. Adding to that is how I used to take out my anger on him when we were still kids. (I'm trying to be a better sister but i know i'll never fit that position i was supposed to fit into, so i end up telling him that I'm sorry for not being the older sister I was supposed to be)  He's a year younger than me. And I know how that affected him especially with our abusive stepmom's treatment with us. I always tell him the possibility of us going NC with our parents/everyone else and with each other in the family when we grow up. And I remind him that what I did wasn't okay even if we were kids and it's completely understandable if he's angry at me too. But he won't listen at that part, and we end up arguing about it."

I can still sense it. But not as much as I used to before, I'm.. glad I'm not the only one. I want to be able to sense it as much as I could like before. And perhaps avoid a toxic friendship/relationship from happening."
