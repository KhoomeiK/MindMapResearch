She isolated me from the rest of the family by defaming me, tried to trick me into conversion therapy, gaslit me, and kicked me out when I transitioned anyways. All while playing the victim to everyone. 


I'm sorry your father is so shitty and disrespecting you and your boundaries. It's a horrible feeling when your parents treat you like this.

We definitely need to watch how we present things. The way we speak, intentionally or not, colour the atmosphere of our communities. And it's part of our responsibility to not say things that could color that environment as hostile or in any way disparaging to FtM or Non-binary people.

Like I'm not... me. 

Outside of the hypothetical, there's no known way to ""stop being trans"" and being transgender is not recognized as a mental illness. It's just a way you are, because of how your gender identity interacts with your body. Only you can decide if you're trans how or if transitioning would be something you need to do. I hope you're able to decide on the plan that best suits your needs 

Being transgender is not a bad thing. You don't need to try and deny your gender identity or pretend to be someone you're not. The science, psychological, and the medical community are on your side in validating you, if you decide you need to transition."

So I think it's easier for parents like that to just discard their kids, as sad as that is to say."
asktransgender,eqn6jhm,t3_bypvwa,1560172298.0,"Shit... what you're describing, what you've experienced, sounds absolutely horrific. I am so sorry that you've experienced that degree of mistreatment and harassment. That's not how it should be, especially in a community meant to be a safe place from transphobia. 

Ive been there too. There's certain parts of the trans community on reddit that I just avoid cause they can be really toxic. Like any community, there's good parts and bad, and good people and bad, but it just sucks that's the case with the trans community too.

Regardless of if someone's trans or not that doesn't give them any leeway whatsoever to be a transphobic arsehole... and I'm sorry. You deserved better."
