DrMartens,fqehgx4,t1_fqef64i,1589307624.0,"I went true to size and they are very comfortable on my feet. However, I always wear them with socks so if I were to wear them on bare feet I would probably size down. But I don't know if it's a thing to wear them on bare feet tbh. And as I said they are very comfortable, I didn't need to break them in or anything and they didn't give me blisters like my other docs have. Although it's true I haven't worn them around that much due to the lockdown so maybe they will kill my feet once I leave the house and wear them for more than a few hours. Overall, I would say go for your regular size and maybe if you have extremely narrow feet then size down."
insaneparents,fqcv941,t1_fqcpaum,1589270096.0,"Oh my god, this reminds me of one time when I was arguing with my parents about why being under the communist regime wasn't good for our country (their generation still believes that their lives were better back then) and I presented some facts from historians which supported my arguments and my father legit said ""so you would rather believe some random person over your parents that you know your whole life?"" It was so ridiculous it caught me off guard"

unpopularopinion,fpt4r24,t1_fpsyjoj,1588884840.0,I was a planned baby. I would even go as far as to say that I was quite liked by my parents while I was a child. The hate came when I started having my own opinions on the world which my parents don't agree with. Now I'm the black sheep of the family.
AskReddit,fpsvfbp,t1_fps96la,1588880281.0,"> Would you say the two languages are similar enough that two random people, one from each country, could have a conversation without either one having studied/practiced the other language? 

I am Slovak and I am currently living and studying in the Czech Republic and when I speak to my Czech professors or Czech friends I speak Slovak and they speak Czech to me. I've never had a problem with understanding a Czech person, but there were a few times when my Czech professor didn't understand a Slovak word so I just said it in Czech and all was good.  To answer your question, I think it is possible for a Czech and a Slovak person to have a conversation without studying or practising each other's language. There are some vocabulary differences that could make the conversation confusing but overall I don't think it would be big of a deal. However, Slovaks are very used to hearing Czech as we are exposed to it from an early age and therefore we understand it pretty well. So I don't know how comprehensible Czech would be for us if we weren't used to hearing it from a young age."

My parents who lived in the USSR had to go the celebrations of May 1st (national holiday) 1986, five days after the disaster, because the government said so. They did not even know about the disaster then because the government didn't want people to know. Imagine how many people were exposed to the radiation from the radioactive cloud that day. Start reading  real history books so you can stop spreading lies on the internet."

I've recently seen many Americans on Twitter praising socialism and as a person living in a country previously under the USSR I was completely flabbergasted. Socialism ruined our economy and many industries. I don't understand how some people can still think that socialism can work.
