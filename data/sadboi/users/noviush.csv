GameTheorists,exxm250,t3_cumowh,1566638473.0,"Cool theory, only one minor flaw I could find.

As far as I know these giant bugs extincted a lot earlier then humans even showed up, so the decrease of oxygen in relations to the enormous bugs isn't related to tge human species. The true reason is mostly unknown as far as I know, but one of the causes is the fact, that decomposing bacteria started to appear at that time and massive swamps began to shrink and it increased the CO2 in the atmosphere, at the same time decreasing oxygen.

Besides that a üëè and a half!"
