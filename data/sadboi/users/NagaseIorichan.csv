Because of increasingly hard times at uni I went to a student help place (hard to translate, it is a mental health and councelling center free for students in my country). There, I did one semester of weekly therapy sessions, and because they seemed to be helpful, they helped me find a long term therapist. During that switch I also got my first diagnosis: Borderline Personality Disorder. I was just happy to have a name, to have “something to blame”, and continued therapy. But I also googled a lot, and kind of did not feel like I had BPD, which encouraged more and more research. And one faithful afternoon I stumbled across an article about how autistic women are often missdiagnosed as BPD. Then I did just over 4 months of research before mentioning to my therapist that I think I might be one of those missdiagnosed women, and he then referred me to a diagnostician to get “proof” in order to optimize therapy for me. 

If you suspect something, you can also get a referral from your normal doctor, but you might have to be a little stubborn since they are no experts and might think only young boys have autism. But a diagnostician (and you should check that they have experience with autism, best also in adults) does know what to look for and should (not all of them do this, it is definetely a quality sign!) listen to all your reasoning about why you think it could be true for you. 

Just a tip though, it helps to say you suspect it, or you think it could affect you, as sometimes doctors can get defensive when you get to see them and say something along the lines of “I have ..., please treat me for it”. Making sure to say you suspect it and then letting them know WHY, is the best way to go (as far as I know)."

For me there were a few reasons:

My country has free health care, so I did not have to pay large amounts of money, therefore nothing really held me back. There was no downside, so even just tiny upsides would have still endet in persuation of a diagnosis. 

I knew I could not comfortably stay in this state of mot ultimately knowing. Now I have my formal “yes you were right” and I still doubt it, but it feels better none the less. Especially if someone does not believe me, now I have something to show for. 

I am hoping to get some improvement on university problems, like maybe taking exams in smaller quieter rooms, etc.

I don’t know where you did the test, but my results also showed me the percentage between two opposing letters. I think it is good to keep that in mind.
