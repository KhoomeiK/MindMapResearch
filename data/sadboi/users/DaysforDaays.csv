dating_advice,f57hzgm,t1_f57b43z,1572036396.0,The fact that you’re trying is what matters here. It’s a rocky road and I think it’s good to let people know of the “terrain” that they’re in store for. On that same note tho I don’t think it needs to be mentioned right away. Give it a little time and then be truthful to how you feel. You’re “normal” just like everybody else man. Don’t count yourself out because your dealing with a lot. You’d be surprised about how many people are in that same boat. We’re all sinking; But  keeping yourself afloat is the goal. Well all find dry land someday.
dating_advice,f57gnj7,t1_f5766i6,1572035801.0,"I don’t know about that. I play myself down a lot because of insecurities but Im honest with everyone I’m with. Brutally honest. So if I’m head over heels then that’ll be prominent. If I’m not really into you then it’s spoken, because I don’t want the other person to hurt. Unsure about that sentiment."
dating_advice,f57frwi,t1_f57ad0t,1572035441.0,I think it’s good to encourage them in the right direction but not take the wheel.
depression,f0g0ci9,t1_f0d8nv0,1568591711.0,"Im really bad about combating my negativity but I think you’re right. It certainly has its merits and I need to stop rolling over and letting myself succumb to constant negativity.
Exercising a good start. Maybe I should incorporate a daily jog or something to always get me going. I appreciate your response and your English was fine   c:"
depression,f0g0034,t1_f0c58wh,1568591562.0,Maybe one day we’ll fight off this pain and can actually think brightly without the clouds dimming every thought. I’d really like it if I could be at a point in my life where I didn’t rain doubt on myself moment to moment. I think I’m gonna try to write more and listen to some comedians and maybe that’ll bridge my foggy mind into better social constructs. We’ll just have to see.
depression,f0fyu70,t1_f0bgoy5,1568591082.0,"Thanks dude, I appreciate the insight. Gonna try to at least applaud myself on the small things and not just roll over and take the self-hate that I always seem to dish to myself. Really combatting the inner darkness as you put it."
depression,f0b6mll,t1_ezy8qq7,1568523128.0,Did you find that the medication helped with that a little when you were on them? I don’t care about libido at this point. Finding a partner is only more disheartening; last thing on my mind. Clearing my fog tho? Sounds pretty nice
depression,f0b5y2l,t1_ezwyun1,1568522895.0,I might try this. Have been thinking writing might be the key to unlocking myself again. I just don’t know where to start.
depression,f0b4x5t,t1_ezwsj9k,1568522540.0,I feel that; used to be the joker and now I barely have words to contribute. I’m so ashamed of this transformation. Really don’t know how things became so alien to me.
depression,f0b3g2w,t1_ezy1qwk,1568522037.0,This was helpful.. I feel like getting treatment might be a good move for me then. I’m just scared of the costs
depression,f0a7s15,t1_ezwopdf,1568511587.0,How do you add colors tho?.. Don’t even know how to enjoy things anymore it seems. It’s like everything just give me nervous tension.
depression,f0a7kue,t1_ezwcvu1,1568511524.0,People talk about partners and I can’t even begin to try to find someone. What can you do with no personality. Nobodies gonna want that. Then there’s the choice of having that cloud of depression around you with someone else. I just feel like an anchor then. A partner is the one thing I feel like would push me outta this shell but is it worth it? Idk..
depression,f0a6rpc,t1_ezwm4q9,1568511261.0,I feel this. I remember having the thought that I was like the life of the party sometimes. I was real good about making people laugh and it was quite the high. I’ve never been full of myself but back then was maybe the closest I had to feeling like I was “something”. Nowadays I can barely talk to people much less make them laugh. I don’t know what happen to half my personality but it feels like it’s gone down the drain. There’s such a disconnect when I’m socializing that I feel like I can never get back to that happy-go-lucky era in my life where I said what was on my mind even if it was dumb. Usually those dumb thoughts had a lot of life and got some laughs.. I was so much brighter then. Now I’m always hugging the dimmest corners for safety or something idk. Too afraid to expose the nothing I’ve become.
depression,f0a4qgh,t1_ezw68ce,1568510600.0,Forgetting how to talk hit me. I feel like I can’t do anything naturally anymore. I’ve been locked away for so long and I just can’t see myself getting out.
PerfectTiming,ezygwjw,t3_d33ho7,1568267878.0,Thought that was a blanket 😂
nonononoyes,eprq0zi,t3_bve9q1,1559429084.0,What a damn queen. Excuse me while I fan over her 😍 lol
wholesomememes,epjpbui,t3_buuunv,1559257102.0,"Parents for Autistic children are the strongest, most thoughtful, and productive people I’ve ever known in my life. They will bring their kids the world specifically made for them so they can handle it. That sort of parenting is beautiful.. so much love for those people. Truly inspiring. I only wish to be half as good one day."
