Firstly, I'm so sorry this is happening to you. 

You're caught up with a very, very dangerous person. Don't underestimate him. One big advantage you have over him, though, is that he is certainly underestimating you. Don't doubt yourself. You can take him.

Here goes:

1. The very first thing I'm gonna ask is Do you have a VPN on the device you are using to post about this? 

Idk if this is really that important, but for the sake of being thorough, if nothing else, I'm gonna give you some straight-up paranoid person advice.

With this question, I'm concerned about ICE, not him. They're heartless monsters, and i don't think there's a lot they wouldn't do to round people up. A VPN will prevent you from being traced. Just Google the best free VPNs for your device, something should come up. If your email is attached to the account your posting from, DELETE this post, delete the account, and get a throwaway (don't attach an email; you don't have to).

2. Do you live in a dorm? If so, can you change rooms? 

If you can, do, ASAP. Don't tell anyone about this until this situation is resolves. Not your friends, not anyone who could talk to him, NO ONE. Do not allow Housing to post your address on the campus directory. Check it over the next few days to make sure they have abided by your request.  

3. Change your phone number as SOON as you can. 

I honestly wouldn't update your friends about the number, until this is resolved. They have not shown to be very good at helping you/keeping you hidden. And you cannot keep allowing his threats against them to manipulate you into giving into his demands: the more you do this, the  worse you will make the situation. The best way you can help your friends is by staying SAFE and HIDDEN from him so you can nail him, and he can quit fucking up everyone's lives.

3. Your computer harddrive. Is there really NO chance of recovering something, anything that could be used to prove what he's done? Where does he message you? Facebook? Some type of IM? 

4. R/legaladvice. Now. Get a VPN in order, and post over there. Be upfront about your state, your parents' immigration status, drug use--anything he can use against you. You need to get whatever protection you can for your parents before he has a chance to do something to get them imprisoned/deported. 

Good luck! Don't communicate with him or go near him, no matter what."

This self-hatred is clearly very deeply-rooted and extremely painful for you. I feel you.

There's a strong chance you truly don't have to live with this pain, if you let someone help you challenge these beliefs and insecurities. I truly think that one day, you could be free from this. 

So, to segue into answering your direct question: maybe your boyfriend can be the first person you open up to about some of this. Tell him how you feel. Or if you can't make yourself go into detail, just say, ""look, i think I have some serious issues surrounding how I look, and knowing those pictures of me are up on Instagram is killing me.

It's good that you can be honest with yourself about it, and show the humility/openness to ask for advice to work on it. Also, it's good you found someone who'll tell you when you're doing something stupid.

My advice: 

1. Look into Stoicism. R/Stoicism is actually a pretty good place to start. Resources on the ""About"" page, I believe. 

If nothing else, The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius is free on Kindle. Reading it definitely helped me to change for the better. Constantly and consistently asking myself ""WWMD?"" for a while made me internalize the reality that you can't control other people, only yourself. It made me focus on honing self-discipline instead of always trying to be right. Also made me understand that chasing the pleasure that comes from sticking it to someone over an ultimately inconsequential argument was truly shameful. I could go on and on, but I recommend just reading the book and seeing what it does for you.  

2. Work on catching yourself when you're starting to feel that drive/anger, and prod at the thoughts and feelings underneath.

Are you feeling defensive, when this drive starts to set in? Is there fear, or anger, or maybe a thought like, ""do they think I'm stupid?"" Maybe you have some insecurities without realizing it, in which case, you should define them as clearly as you can, then challenge them. Is that insecurity based in logic or truth? Probably not.

Similarly, thinking back to how far you can remember doing this might be helpful. Do you have a sibling or parent who exhibited similar behavior or who egged you on? Why did it work?

Journaling's helpful for some people, with this type of thing. 

Personally? When I've realized I have a set of insecurities about something, I write them down on some looseleaf, go out to the fire pit, and burn the paper. Don't know why, but it's more helpful to me.

3. Take the good with the bad.

Controversial advice, maybe, and don't take it if it's going to encourage the bad behavior rather than help you change it. But I try to recognize and utilize the strengths that come with a bit of a combative nature/habit, while also tempering the weaknesses. 

For example:

Use the passion to stand up for others, even when no one else is. But discipline yourself to do it calmly and with honor.

Call out others, when you see them making the same mistakes you have. But do it kindly and without judgment. 

Sorry this is long. Good luck."

Again, this is a perpetually-full laundry basket and a desk pile, limited to her own room. That's really quite tame, relatively speaking. Even for a lot of non-depressed people I know, this would be MIRACULOUSLY clean. 

>I've had depression and anxiety, but I kept my shit clean because there were people who depended on me and ""not being motivated"" is not an excuse to live in filth.

If ""filth"" to you is one basket of laundry and one desk pile, I feel obligated to inform you that you might have more issues than anxiety and depression to work through, my guy. 

>Guarantee she's underplaying the mess to make herself sound better, the way everyone on the internet skews stories - no one wants to admit they are the villain of their story.

This attitude is quite common on this site, and it's pretty silly. 

You know what I think? I think OP's actually an orphan, she's imagined her parents to cope with the loss, and she actually lives in a treehouse and speaks squirrel. 

Discussing the possibility that I'm right will be about as fruitful as discussing whether people who post on this site are lying/downplaying--cerainly/at least when there are no slip-ups/evidence of lying on their part. 

>her saying ""I'm depressed/ADHD"" is an excuse - she gets out and goes to school, has a part time job, etc. - she is not bedridden

No, she's not! And the things she manages to do even if it's hard are things she should be proud of, not be feeling shame for when she hasn't done more.

Keeping her mess limited to a laundry basket and a standard desk pile can be counted among those accomplishments. 

>Her parents did her a favor by cleaning her room, in their house that they pay for, and she reacts by screaming at them, throwing things around, and generally throwing a tantrum like a toddler - at 21 years old.

Her parents invaded her privacy while she was out studying and working, threw away books she'd paid for and they knew she treasured, told her she's not allowed to have them in her room, and told her she wasn't allowed autonomy in their home. 

She'd also informed them of her plan organize all the things she'd moved (so the house could be painted) that same day. 

She had every right to be upset.

You can talk about how entitled and lazy she is till the cows come home. You can insinuate she's lying to make herself seem better all day.

It sounds to me like there were some serious boundary issues going on, here. Reasons I say this: 

>my parents don’t know about my mental health nor will I ever be able to speak to them about it

Why would this be the case? The way you worded it makes me think that they wouldn't be understanding, or open to listening to you. 

Also, if they're the kind of parents who believe you're ""not allowed autonomy in their house,"" they almost certainly would be angry/resentful if they sensed you weren't telling them something. Even though that's fucked up. 

In fact, ""organizing"" your room may have been a weird way of trying to regain their perceived loss of control over you.  

>They basically said that I’m never going to organize my room so they had to. And that it’s their house so I have no autonomy. They threw out what was garbage to them. And that I’m not allowed to keep my books that I paid for in my room because there’s no space.

To me, throwing out your books is the biggest indication of some serious boundary issues, here. Why would they feel the need to do that, except to ""punish"" you? Which makes no sense anyway, to me, because (taking you at your word) your room wasn't even very messy. Just some standard desk/laundry piles. 

You moved the stuff to the middle of the room for painting, and let them know what your plan was, to deal with it that same day. What the hell was their problem? 

Sorry that was long, but I wanted to back up this proposal/conclusion: I don't think living with your parents again is the way to go. Yes, you were in their home, but don't listen to the entitled boomer assholes who're gonna tell you they were within their rights to do this: it was an invasion of your privacy. Of course you got upset. 

Your job doesn't give you enough money for rent. What if you got a roommate? Can your school help you? Can a friend put you up, in the meantime?

Why would he think she was being dishonest? 

Might seem like a stupid question, but I'm asking: Specifically, why? Because he made one offhanded comment years ago about liking her lack of social media presence, and she didn't glean from that interaction that she should instantly tell him about a Facebook account she'd deactivated 2 years previously? 

C'mon, now. It's not remotely clear from one comment in a 4-year relationship that this issue is even that important to him. 

Not telling him about the account wasn't a breach of trust. At all. She didn't even use it anymore by the time their relationship began. Even if he said, ""I like your lack of social media presence,"" while she was super active on Facebook, that isn't a prompt for her to inform him about the account. Not doing so isn't a breach of trust. 

 >I definitely thought his anger was disproportionate
