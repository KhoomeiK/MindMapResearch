So basically, Heechul's issue isn't ""finding himself"", he is 36 years old and has been dating women secretly and now publicly, so he's had a long time to find himself, especially since he's extremely popular among his peers, male.and female. His issue is the fear that all the gay male fans he has would feel rejected. It's a product of the industry in this case, not a societal thing or an issue with uncertainty. If even one fan out there feels rejected by him proclamation of straightness, it's a loss. Plus he's just a really kind person, and acutely aware of how extreme fans can be and doesn't want to upset anyone.

But yeah, just think of folks like JYJ's Jaejoong. He's crazy beautiful, up there with Heechul, but I don't think I've ever heard of him being called gay. Junsu, who isn't as pretty though, but has been called gay after being in a musical or something like that. Then you have Jo Kwon who by Korean standards isn't pretty at all, but acted in a musical as a crossdresser or something, therefore gay. G.O of MBLAQ was afraid of Heechul's stares because he thought he'd get hit on or something (pfft, he should be so lucky), but G.O looked very flamboyant at times, according to western standards, while Heechul was just impressed by well groomed G.O's mustache lol. 

It's so arbitrary, but almost never based on beauty or use of makeup or even crossdressing. It's just a sort of a mishmash of both person's appearance, interests but also maliciousness of the ""netizens"". 

And the interesting part is that, back when I was still into kpop, less ""woke"" westerners quickly adopted this same habit of just deciding someone was gay because of some reason they chose. I mean, we all have ships and all that, but you can't just decide your oppa is gay because you wanna see him have sex with your other oppa and then start bombarding them with stuff that isn't welcome in their society."
MensLib,fqqjehv,t1_fqq3bng,1589566556.0,"To a certain level only. I haven't been into kpop in a while, my time has passed, but incidentally, my favourite kpop idol was and is one of those men who repeatedly raised hackles of the homophobic in the industry, Kim Heechul of Super Junior. He is stunningly beautiful (I may be biased but seriously, that what he's known for), has been cross-dressing regularly since debut (crossdressed as Lady Gaga, and she liked it), kissed a lot of other men in public, is known to follow girl groups closely, has a lot of female friends, has cutesy outfits and interests, etc. Dude's just altogether weird and unique and I love him to death. However, a lot of people, including his own bandmates, were very sure he was gay to the point of avoiding him. It was so rampant that now that we know he's dating Momo, people make jokes about how he can finally put those rumours behind him (because, y'know, bisexuals, like unicorn, don't exist). Everything got worse when he became an open lgbt supporter, even going so far as saying that he doesn't wanna say he isn't gay to not hurt gay people by denying it too aggressively (and he's aware denying won't help really). So while being beautiful isn't ""gay"", there is a point where ""not gay just pretty"" turns into ""gay for sure and also pretty"". No amount of denying would help, just dating a girl. The freedom of expression in kpop is pretty, well, free, but there is a point when that is no longer true and just simply saying ""no i like girls"" will not change anyone's mind and you're marked forever as gay, until you date a woman. Which, of course, is sometimes enough to end a career, so it can be a lose-lose situation, if you're not beloved enough to ""rise above"" SK's homophobia.

There is a certain subtype of pretty korean men who can still stay ""not gay"" while beautiful, but they usually have to counter the beauty with supersexual dancing while shirtless, manly hobbies and whatever else they can think of. Being beautiful is ""okay"", but being beautiful and not manly equals gay."

MensLib,fqmrwf1,t1_fqmo79j,1589482503.0,"Yeah, I agree, mental illness is definitely not just ""what's wrong"" with the person. Heck, my PTSD isn't because of something I did, it's because of something my ex did. And my depression is largely because of still living with an abusive father. There are definitely times when the issue comes from something easily solvable. But even in that case, until the issue is resolved, you might need treatment. It's not the case here, but I assume it is the case in health care systems like USA, but you probably need to be diagnosed to be treated. I don't think a diagnosis necessarily means you and you alone are the issue, sometimes the issue could be bureaucracy. In this case, it's bureaucracy that needs fixing. I can go to my doctor and say I'm not feeling well today, my allergies are really bad, I can't go to work. I can get a sick note (all for free) saying I have respiratory issues, give it to my employer and get paid 75 (iirc) percent of my wage. If doctor sees that I'm sick, they say I'm sick and that's all. The same is with medication, I come into the pharmacy and get my prescription even without having a specific diagnosis. It seems to be the biggest issue with stigma stems from health systems more worried about bureaucracy and money than patients. Get rid of bureaucracy, get rid of overdiagnosing without depriving people of their treatments."

MensLib,fqmnalz,t1_fqmkurd,1589480290.0,"That's what I'm trying to say. I don't like that the article definitely states that these people don't have a mental illness, it's simply more likely it just wasn't diagnosed and whatever the circumstances surrounding the person at the time of the suicide were just a stressor, an unhealthy reaction to an event (I overdosed on klonopin because a cat wouldn't let me pet it, so I know something about unhealthy reactions lol). Lord knows men tend to avoid doctors even when it's for a physical issue, so it's not unlikely that a lot of men go undiagnosed, and also likely that some of them would go on to commit suicide."
MensLib,fqmm1ka,t1_fqmjycq,1589479685.0,"That does make sense, but I don't think suicide would be the only issue in this case. You could also say the same about substance abuse, violent tendencies, even things like hypersexuality. I always took illness to mean that whatever is wrong with you is interfering with your daily life. I wouldn't call just any sad person depressed, but when the sadness prevents you from functioning normally, that's an illness. And suicide kinda does, you know, prevent you from functioning, at all, ever again.

I mean, that's how it works here. If whatever is wrong with you, mentally or physically, isn't really preventing you from existing as usual, doctors don't even bother giving a full diagnosis, just treatment of necessary. It's why I've been told by doctors that I have artritis or similar disease, but it's not ""bad enough"" to even try to determine what it is exactly. I'm in the same boat with PTSD. Doctors tell me I have it, but official diagnosis doesn't really matter because the treatment I'm getting for BPD is the same as the treatment I'd get for PTSD, so they never formally diagnosed PTSD."
suggestmeabook,fqmkhlg,t3_gjlhu0,1589478938.0,"Hm, not exactly fitting but Seven Kennings books by Kevin Hearne come to mind. Basically it's from the perspective of a dude who is, besides living his daily life, listening to another dude, a bard, telling a story to a huge crowd of people. Every day is a new chapter and every day the bard tells a new piece of the story from the perspective of various different characters, where the story is just retelling of the events that led to the bard having to tell this story to this group in the first place. Sorry for the weird description, I'm trying not to spoil anything by accident, because just describing the format kinda spoils some stuff."
