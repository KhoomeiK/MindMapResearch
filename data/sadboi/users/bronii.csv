It is also okay to not know what you are going to do with the rest of your week or day. As a suicide survivor I find sometimes I don't know what i'm going to be doing with the next few hours but I push myself to make it to the end of those couple of hours to see what happens next.

Also, if your feeling become worse or more intense walk yourself to the ER and share with them all of this and how your feel. Especially the suicidal ideation. That should be more than enough to get you into the treatment you need.

If they refuse to help get your treatment the ER may even get child protective services involved. You can probably do that too. What your parents are saying to you is verbal abuse and it should not be tolerated."
BorderlinePDisorder,ez4u2g8,t3_czmogi,1567692105.0,"I've found that always calling 9-1-1 or your mobile crisis unit when someone threatens suicide can be helpful at deterring most people from making the threat. My reasoning to the person is always ""I am not a trained clinician, I dont know how serious this is. Better safe than sorry!"" 

In my state, calling 9-1-1 on a suicide threat always results in a stay in the ER until the crisis evaluation is completed. This can take up the entire day. While in the ER the person is stripped of everything they might use to harm themselves and either placed in a specialized section of the ER for psych patients or placed on a 1:1 for suicide watch. Either way this can be very uncomfortable for the person. 

Additionally, while in the ER, I do not communicate with the person. I wait until the crisis assessment is over and the person has been discharged and/or admitted to a psychiatric hospital depending on how serious the threat is. This also makes the person uncomfortable.

Eventually people learn that suicide threats do not get you whatever you're using them to get and begin associating it with the hospital instead (which, actually, is the right thing to associate the threat with) 

I've done my best to completely remove the emotion out of the suicide threat so the person doesn't see they are getting a reaction out of me outside of the necessary phone call to emergency services. I've made it this black and white situation that is very easy to understand for the suicidal person. 

All of this works with older adults too. There are geriatric units for psychiatric patients. It would be completely reasonable for you to use these services if you feel you can not cope  with any aspect of this suicidal behavior."

Until you are ready to commit to such an intensive program you can use some of the skills you have now to adjust your responses. It sounds like you have some awareness of what you  some of your issues are. You can begin to develop a plan for how you can decrease the intensity of your response to things when they do not go your way. Be prepared to accept and validate your emotion around whatever situation and then accept whatever the situation is as it is.

I experience the same thing, because I pay my rent on time I am stable. Also I am my most stable and pleasant when I'm at my psych appointments.

To get my psych people to listen to me I try to be as honest and detailed with my month as possible. I usually start each appointment with acknowledging that I look okay in that moment. Then I follow up with something like ""but I've been really labile lately"" and tell them about every mood swing and anger outburst, how many nights I wasnt able to sleep, how many day's I couldn't bring myself to get out of bed, that i have completely lost my appetite and that I have been thinking a lot about suicide. 

I also have data from this app I use to track all of this called mood tracker diary and whatever other apps that track things like sleep. I like being able to say well 20 out of 30 days of the last month I have thought about suicide.

I would maybe stress how, as a whole, how unhealthy I feel. 

Realistically however, there is only so much my psychiatrist and my therapist can do for me. My psychiatrist can adjust my meds and hope that works. My therapist will remind me to use my DBT skills and make a safety plan with me for the next time I feel out of control. Both will tell me to go to the ER if I truly feel like I've lost it and need a lot of help right now.

When I have suicidal thoughts that include planning I go to the ER and prepare to be admitted to an inpatient program.

 Also it is very difficult to diagnose a personality disorder in such a short time of treatment since not all the behaviors for a personality disorder may manifest themselves. Your personality may be disordered but it may not be clear which of the cluster b personality disorders you have. I received a diagnosis of ""unspecified cluster B personality disorder.""

That said I understand not very many people want to go to the ER because usually that means getting committed or whatever. I would still rather be committed with people around me for a week than alone in my room smoking pot and sleeping all day. The structure alone is enough to make you feel better.

I dont know how old you are so its hard to say anything. Identity comes with age and experience. Im going to assume you're older than 22 for the rest of this  post. By that age you are pretty much who you are. 

Also while you're thinking about who you are remember that what your describing is a trait of BPD. It is literally one of the diagnostic criteria for BPD.  

Anyways that void inside of you isn't going to fill up until you learn to love yourself. It took me a long time to do that. Im almost 40 now. Before I filled my void I smoked a lot of pot and bounced around from thing to thing and job to job not knowing what I liked.

For example, the music I listen too has remained the same since like 2002. I mean I don't dislike new music I just don't care to listen to it.  There are things that I definitely do not like. These are the things that make me cringe. I guess you can try to write down those things to start with.  Eventually you'll write down enough things to see that there is more to you than just an empty shell. 

You might not be able to do this alone. You may benefit from a therapist or something. Here is the deal with therapy. You really have to want to work and the work will be uncomfortable because its work and not as easy as doing whatever it is you're doing now. There is a piece of you that's not going to want to do the work and therefore deem therapy to be bullshit nonsense. Try DBT its usefull bullshit nonsense. 

 one more thing. Mixing drugs with mental illness is dangerous. If you have a serious addiction problem you will not be able to work on yourself until you've addressed the substance abuse. If you're like me and smokes pot to cope with the intensity of the symptoms of bpd then I get it its hard to want to stop. I did myself a favor and got a good psychiatrist that does medical marijuana. It helps to have someone monitor what you're doing if you know you can't handle doing it properly by yourself.

 What I've learned is suicide is no joke and very scary for people to think about. It is also hard to process because unlike terminal illness like cancer suicide is something you can work towards preventing. The people around you may feel personally insulted that you would lose sight of your friendships with them and make an attempt anyways (or whatever happened. in my state you don't get placed on a weeks psychiatric hold for simply saying you want to kill yourself. You actually have to do something) Maybe you're friends are accepting that no matter what they try you still may make an attempt to take your life again and to ensure they are not hurt so badly if you do make an attempt they are creating emotional distance. 

Maybe this is being perceived by people as an attempt to get more attention from the people around you.  The appropriate response there is to not reward the suicidal person with the attention while ensuromg they are safe by contacting the authorities. 

You're friends may be protecting themselves from pain you may cause them through your actions. Everyone else has a life that does not revolve around you. It is very unlikely that the people around you will put their lives on hold just for you. It is unfair to expect that of them. 

The reality is no mater how much we would like to there is nothing we can do to control what other people choose to do or not do. If you're not okay with their actions then it is your choice as to whether or not you want to continue being their friend or find new ones. 

Another thing I was asked to think about early in my recovery is this question; How can you expect people to want to be around you when you don't even be around you? You may want to focus on learning to love who you are by yourself. Once accomplishing that you will learn that you really do not need people.  

If you dont like what is going on right now you really have to think about the triats that you exhibit that may be pushing people away. Its not just that you tried to kill yourself typically.

Again if you are a minor you will have to wait for your parents consent to talk to someone. if you are experiencing any suicidal thoughts or self destructive behaviors are severe enough for you to need stitches the ER will not discharge you with out seeing a crisis screener or psychiatric professional first. If your parents still refuse to let you be seen by the screener than the ER can contact Child Protective Services. 

If you are an adult, screw your parents you dont need them to get the help you feel like you need. There are a number of online resources you may be able to use find a mental health professional that will evaluate you. You can also find your county mental health services. If you are experiencing self destructive behaviors that might result in serious injury to you or someone else or if you are experiencing suicidal thoughts you can go to the ER and get help. You actually can go to the ER at any point and ask for help with your mental health. Typically someone will be able to give you some type of support or referral to a community provider. 

&#x200B;

**If you are experiencing suicidal thoughts or self destructive behaviors that might result in serious injury to you or someone else do not hesitate to call 9-1-1**.  as a gauge I generally believe that any injury that requires stitches is an injury serious enough to go the the ER for."
BorderlinePDisorder,ewnv19v,t3_cp7ags,1565591919.0,"Only a trained clinician who's known you for a little while can accurately give you a BPD diagnosis. 

That said there are a few things that would like you to keep in mind. First there is a reason why the borderline diagnosis can not be made until 18. Your identity and personality is still developing. Your brain is still developing and it won't be completely finished for about another 7 years. Your body is also doing the development thing and your thoughts and feeling can be influenced by all those lovely hormonal changes that happen at your age. I also know many women who's moods become unstable from hormonal changes during the days that lead up to their periods, including myself. All the times I've had to go to psychiatric hospitals were during my period.  So in short short some of whats going on is just part of what everyone goes through at your stage of life.

Next, suicidal ideation is no joke. The more you think about it the closer you get to it being suicidal actions. That is scary and needs to be assessed by a psychiatric professional. If your are experiencing suicidal thoughts please do not hesitate to contact the suicide crisis line  [https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/)  or the suicide text line  [https://www.crisistextline.org/](https://www.crisistextline.org/) .  There are trained crisis professionals working for those lines who've help a lot of different people. If they suggest something listen to them and try it. 

Next please share your thoughts and feelings with your parents and/or another adult you trust. You may even consider sharing how you feel with your guidance counselor at school when you start in a month or so. Tell them you've been thinking about hurting yourself and express how that makes your feel. If you tell someone at school they are obligated to ensure you are psychiatrically screened (or at least thats how it is in NJ) If you tell your parents and they brush it off or try to minimalize it like my mom did when I was a young person you still have options for getting help. You may not be able to get your own therapist with out your patent's consent but you can go to any emergency room on your own and tell them you've been thinking about suicide. They will admit you, call your parents and do an emergency psychiatric screening or crisis screening before they can discharge you. If your parents refuse to let you be screened the emergency room can and will call child protective services because suicidal ideation is no joke. Once the screening is completed the clinician will discuss the resources that are available for you. You may go home with instructions to see a therapist and psychiatrist, or may benefit from an after school theraputic program where they teach you ways to  cope with your world and manage your emotions while keeping you entertained with some great activities. The clinician may also recommend that you stay in the hospital for a couple of days to get started on psychotropic medications. Adolescent in patient programs are like summer camp but with groups and a psychiatrist to see everyday. They can be fun and may be a welcomed respite from whatever is going on in your life.

Thank you for reaching out. That takes a lot of courage. I hope you find better days.  Take care of yourself, you are important to this world."
BorderlinePDisorder,ewnkr8x,t3_cp2z98,1565581157.0,"I feel the same way about social media sometimes I think. For me it drives me nuts when I send someone a message that I know they have read but just couldnt bother to respond to. Like seriously, wtf its like 30 seconds to give me your answer. wtf. Am i not worth 30 seconds?

What I do keep myself sane with social media is accept that I can't control what people do or do not do. I accept that I do not know what is going on in their world. I try my best not to assume things like ""she's my twin she isn't responding to my question because she hates me and doesn't like talking to me. she's probably trying to avoid me"" 

I try to seperate the facts from my feelings and avoid assumptions.  my twin isn't responding to me. (fact) I am afraid that she might hate me (feeling) and do my best to remain level headed about what is going on. Also I try to avoid cognitive distortions ( [https://psychcentral.com/lib/15-common-cognitive-distortions/](https://psychcentral.com/lib/15-common-cognitive-distortions/) ) since they do skew reality and make things feel worse than they actually are. 

I have also had to spend time evaluating the my personal values. Yes social media is a great way to communicate but what value am I getting from it? It shows me how many people Ive connected with yes but are those connections true friendships? I have something 500 facebook friends. Do I value the number or do I value the quality of my friendships? I have 500 ""friends"" but I only really ever talk to 5 of them. Whats the point of the other 495?

I've also tried to re-purpose social media platforms for myself. Yes its a way to communicate directly with people but really its like blog, a diary, a scrapbook? Its a place where I write my thoughts down, post pictures of things that are important to me, things I've done, places I've seen. Its where I put the memes that make me laugh. Facebook is for me to keep track of my own life and remember all the things I've done. Its my chronological story of my special events. The fact that people liked things in my story isn't what makes those events special. If that were the case then you would be posting things like a screenshot showing all the likes you got from the picture of you finishing that marathon. What more awesome, finishing the marathon or knowing a bunch of people mindlessly tapped ""like"" when they saw it on their feed."
BorderlinePDisorder,ewnfd80,t3_cp2dxi,1565576675.0,"I've survived many suicidal nights and what I've learned from all of them is if its bad just go to the ER. 

They are obligated to take you and have you talk to a therapist or social worker who can help you develop a plan for how to handle this and connect you with resources that you can use in the future if you feel like this again. It will also give you a safe place to feel your feelings or cool off and get some rest. 

If you're worried about paying for the services there are social workers that can help you with that. You may even qualify for emergency medicaid and things like that since suicide is no joke. A little while ago I was about to be homeless and had literally nothing and no one to turn to.  the emergency room gave me a bed to sleep in and people to talk to that genuinely wanted to help me improve my life circumstances. 

&#x200B;

You're not alone in this. People like me and the other people on this sub can help support you emotionally and even help you connect with services you might be able to use. 

I've been doing this suicidal thing on and off for a long time and I've learned how to navigate the mental health system and social services really well. There is a lot out there for you its just hidden right now. There are better days ahead if you are willing to wade through all the shit in life to get to them."
BorderlinePDisorder,ewndce4,t3_cp1e8y,1565575117.0,"Before anything else: **If you feel like that you will self harm to the point of needing stitches or if you find yourself thinking about taking more medicine go to the emergency room. You can call 9-1-1 and tell them you can't stop thinking about hurting yourself.**  

This situation sounds rough. From I can gather from your post it seems like you may feel angry, betray, isolated, scared of the worst case scenario and completely powerless. I would feel the same way too if I found out my boy friend was lying to me and I had no way of addressing the situation in that moment. 

First, if you're still experiencing the freak out (the name I've given my boderline responses to things I'm afraid of or don't like, confuse me or contradict my perception of reality) take like two minutes to listen to yourself breath. Do your best to notice everything about breathing, the sound you hear of the air coming from your nose, the feeling of the air passing through you nose, down the back of your throat and into your lungs. Note the feeling of your chest rising and falling. Maybe close your eyes and try to visualize your heart beat slowing down with each breath.

if that is too much or too long try for a minute or 30 seconds. 

When something has happened or I'm obsessing about something I really can not do anything about in that moment the freak out makes everything, including thinking a lot harder. The breathing helps slow down the freak out to a manageable pace. 

If focusing on your breath is not helping you go to your shower, turn only the cold water on and get in. The shock I get from the cold water helps me by drawing more raw emotion out of me than the feeling of pushing something something sharp against my skin until i bleed. 

If that doesn't help or you can not bring yourself to do that reach out to a crisis hotline. I like the suicide textline personally. A live person may be able to provide you comfort and help you cope with the swirl of thoughts it sounds like you're experiencing. They can also send somebody out to you for in person support if there is a mobile crisis team for your area. Mobile response teams tend to be 24 hour services which is nice to know the next time you have a crisis at 4:17 am. This website has a couple or hotlines that you might want to try  [https://findyouranchor.us/Resources](https://findyouranchor.us/Resources) 

**If you've tried all of this and still can't stop the freak out go to your emergency room. Tell them you're afraid you might hurt yourself. They will be required to do a crisis assessment and this will give you a safe space to ride out the rest of your freak out.** 

 If you're feeling safe and not freaking out anymore you can start to consider what the lying means, is your relationship over, is everything a lie thing. 

The reality is, until you speak with him calmly and separate the facts from your feelings you may not be able to truly know the answers to your questions. 

Your intense response and your current fears may also cause you to ultimately end up with the worst case scenario, your relationship could be over. You're going to need your strength to sit down and sort out the facts from your feelings. You will also have to identify  your values. for example:

Your values: Honesty, your self respect

Fact 1: Last week your bf told you he's never been to NYC

Fact 2: Last night he reminisced about a concert he saw in Manhatan. 

Fact 3: Facts 1 and 2 do not match and your are now confused.

Your feelings: 

You are feeling annoyed at the discrepancy. 

You are feeling angry that at some point he did not tell you the truth. 

You are feeling angry that he does not respect your value of honesty.

You are feeling afraid that he might have told other lies before.

You are feeling afraid/angry that your relationship might be a sham.

&#x200B;

Having done that you can make a plan as to how you will handle this situation and then also make a plan for what you will do if the conversation is a complete disaster worst case scenario kind of thing so that you do not do something dangerous or destructive if things don't go the way you want them to go. Maybe have a friend to call or visit with on stand by. Your plan can even be go to the ER if you're like me and immediately go the the ""OMG my life is over. im not worth being loved. i want to kill myself"" and then act on your immediate emotions. Its like obviously i dont want to kill myself but because my emotions are so intense its feels, in that moment, like my life is over. The goal is to get to the next moment, and then the moment after that so if you're like me and live with the I want to kill myself intensity of emotions then going to the ER is the safest plan.

After making the plan of how you will handle the conversation you then have to wait until you there is an appropriate time to have that conversation. Try putting yourslef in the other person's shoes for a minute: its 3 am and you're trying to sleep because you have things to do in the morning and you get a random phone call. That might not be an appropriate time to have a conversation about honesty. Many people would be angry if they were woken up at 3 am regardless of the situation. I got angry at my bf once because he drunk called me to tell me how much he loved me at 3 am.  I wasn't angry at him for telling me he loved me but, rather, for violating a boundary. 

Maybe a more appropriate time and place would be over brunch or something.

Anyways, You have this conversation with him at an appropriate time pointing out the facts first. (last week you said you've never been to NYC but last night you were talking about a concert you went to in manhatan.)

And follow it with how this made you feel. This made me feel annoyed because at some point you did not tell me the truth. This also make me feel worried because I am uncertain about what other things you may have been dishonest about. Honesty if important to me and it make me sad and mad when people are dishonest with me. 

Having laid out the fact and your feelings you can give him an opportunity to respond. You may not hear what you want to hear. Be prepared for that. The reality is you don't know what he might say and his response might be something you don't expect. 

Try to clear your mind of expectations before the conversation. Be prepared that he may say or do any number of things when confronted with the facts. This is something you have no control over and it might be difficult if he says or does something you do not want him to say or do. Response can range from acknowledgement of wrong doing and an apology to him gas-lighting you and telling you you are nuts and not remembering things correctly to him getting angry at you. I mean it really can be anything. 

If you're still able to continue having this conversation with him you then need to set a firm boundary. Something like ""Honesty is important to me and I can not be with someone who lies about things, even if they are small. If you continue to lie to me I may need to take a step back from this relationship as you are unable to respect my values. 

&#x200B;

I hope this helped you and everything in the next couple days go well. Thank you for posting and asking for help. It takes courage to do that. Feel better and take care of yourself. You are valuable to this world and loved as well."

If you don’t need to go inpatient you’ll be held in the Er until you are psychiatrically cleared and sent home with some referrals. 

I struggle every day with wanting to end my life and I know when everything gets unbearable I can change my surroundings and get someone to talk to about what’s going on just by calling the hotline and asking for help. It can help and a week at the hospital might be a nice respite.

Edit: I forgot to add you don’t need an ambulance to take you. You can Uber/lyft to the Er which can be cheaper than going in an ambulance if you have to pay for the ambulance.

Drugs,ev3sh6x,t3_cicc03,1564201025.0,"Your brain is developing still and doesn’t stop until you’re about 22 ish so yeah you’re hurting yourself. 

Okay that said here is my horror story about drugs. I work in the psychiatric er in my area. A lot of people come to us because of what we believe to be drug induced psychosis. That is super scary and I don’t wish that on anyone. These people usually freak out, are super paranoid, think they’re dying or feeling things crawl on them. It’s horrible to watch. These people have to be held in the er for a couple of days until they clear up. Some people don’t and end up being committed to psychiatric hospitals. The drug I’ve seen really mess kids up is synthetic weed or whatever k2 is. 

I don’t know the specific effects of drugs but there are a lot of great resources on substances you can google search for. I also used to go to erowid.org when I was young and experimenting. It helped me learn about a lot of things. 

Now I google the drugs name and .edu to find scholarly articles about the mental and psysical side effects of drugs. 


My final thing to share is everyone is different and from a mental health perspective it’s hard to tell what will happen. There are factors like do you already have issues or past trauma to take into consideration. For example if you’re depressed and use mdma you are setting yourself up for a bad week as your body has to replace all of your serotonin. 


It’s good that you’re asking questions though. Thank you for trying to be smart and trying to learn."

At school use all the free counseling services available to you.

That way when she says she won't pay for your school you can simply say ""okay"" and leave it at that. She'll eventually notice that she doesn't have power over you with that threat and move on to something else.

For my family going to the hospital was enough for them to understand the severity of my mental illness.

Otherwise I would begin with googling county mental health services for the county/state you live in. You'll likely find a list of clinics that provide services on a sliding scale based off your income.

Honestly, I would just go to the emergency room and simply say i'm hearing voices. that probably the easiest way to be linked with services.
