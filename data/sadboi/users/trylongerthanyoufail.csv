fuckeatingdisorders,fp3g3lr,t3_gay5se,1588278698.0,"I would really recommend you the book ""8 keys to recovery from an eating disorder"". The authors are two women who recovered from ED and they give exactly the kind of tips you're looking for. They also discribe the phase you're in: ""I want to change but I don't know how"" and what phase comes after and how to reach it with exercises and small steps.   
This book was a crazy help for me and I'm at a point I could never imagine possible in recovery. I hope it can help you too. 

Don't give up"

It's not a good thing to manage to throw up, it's like you have opened the door to heart attacks, fallen teeth, among other really bad stuff. Is there anyone you can talk to around you ? If no, feel free to DM me if you want to talk about all this. I know a bit this topic, it's more than 10 years that I had bulimia with binge / purges and I'm in the process of recovery which is quite hard, especially since I got so used to do this. Please don't get used to, it seems like making things easy but it's really making your life extremely complicated and damaged in the end."

I'm in this period you talk about, where the destructive habits are gone but I cannot stop scrutinizing my body to check if it's changing, worrying about my weight (even if I won't use a scale anymore). And I was thinking ""FUCK, this is still quite shit, this is still not what I want. I'm thinking the whole time about my weight. Not much about binging / purging anymore but about how large my thighs and ass are"". 

But I'm having breakfast now and I'm reading your post at the same time, and it's telling me that if I just keep going, this will also fade. So FUCK YES I'll keep going. 

Thank you really much for sharing this, I'm super proud of you, I'm super proud of us all going through this and continuing fighting every day to reach what you managed."

You binged under stress so you gained some weight from it, but your body knows what's his natural size and if you listen to the signal it sends you you will lose the kilos that don't fit you just by eating normally again. 

In time of stress if you feel an urge to binge coming next time you can try to sit for the first 5 minutes and listen to what happens in your head, it's really interesting and helps understand what exactly is stressing you. Try to put precise words on what you feel during those five minutes. Also, an urge never stays, it vanishes after 20 minutes in average. It can seem like eternity but it's rationally not that long !"

EDAnonymous,for06j8,t1_foqi20s,1588003892.0,"Hi, 28 here and having an ED for quite long. But I do think full recovery is possible. There is plenty of examples for this, people explaining that this ""monster"" or ""voice"" or ""Ed"" is not there anymore and won't come again because during recovery they developed the skills needed to cope with the situations that their ED was helping them to cope with. I think it's a really long process, but there is an end. If you continue fighting and continue doing what feels impossible or terrifying you will recover. There is a great book from two authors who recovered called ""8 keys to recovery from an eating disorder"" that I found extremely helpful in keeping this hope and motivation needed to recover one day."
EdAnonymousAdults,foqxcta,t3_g91bpt,1588002482.0,"Man I know what you mean. I'm trying to recover I have some really nice moments when I eat the lunch I want with a friend and I'm so happy I can do it, but then after in the evening the voice comes back telling me ""it's enough now, the game is over and you stop enjoying all this you will become so fat eating the whole time are you crazy going from nothing to 3 meals just stop eating"". This cycle is horrible and it's already a great victory that you could enjoy a normal breakfast. Focus on this pleasure and small moment of calm and normality, this can be all the time if you continue your efforts and try to break this cycle for real. 

it's normal to be blocked in some steps of our recovery I think. But every time we need to remember that what we need to do is what we think is impossible. You're wrong thinking you cannot do it. You CAN do it. You CAN disobey your eating disorder and decide to not restrict, and you don't need to wait to feel like doing it. Breaking the cycle doesn't come naturally, you need to force the exit door.

Don't wait not to be afraid anymore, this probably won't happen. Go against your fear, eat breakfasts and don't restrict after.  What feels impossible today will slowly become something that you can enjoy freely if you break this fear door"
EDAnonymous,fooaoxf,t3_g8e1qh,1587935660.0,This is super cool to read
EdAnonymousAdults,foiypf3,t3_g7edwc,1587801652.0,"First  your not an idiot, you're in an abusive relationship with a strong  eating disorder playing with your emotions to bring you where he wants.  Now knowing this, remember that EACH TIME you're not accepting to do  what he wants, you're making him weaker. Also, the disordered thoughts  will disappear at last in your recovery process, so don't expect not to  think about binging. It will happen, less and less but it will still  happen from times to times. Instead remember that you need to hold in  average 20 minutes, and the urge will go away. I know how 20 minutes can  feel extremely long but at least you know it's only 20 minutes, your  rational part knows that is not that long.

20  minutes to wait to weaken your eating disorder, meaning that next time  the urge will come later and won't be that strong. It's kind of worth  giving it a try.

Last words,  relapses happen and it's not a drama at all. You can get back on track  when you want, directly after the relapse if you want. Remember that the  most important is just not to stop trying. You can also use these  relapses to learn something about yourself, like what made you relapse.  Just before your binge, when you have the urge, try to hold just some  minutes, close your eyes and listen to what you're thinking / feeling.  You can still binge and purge after if it's too strong, but try to hold  those 5 minutes and write down what you thought and felt, there is  chances inside those thoughts there is some information about what  triggered you, if not directly the reason of the urge. Are you angry,  annoyed, bored, uncomfortable, feel stupid for something ? Next time you  will be able to see the situation coming and either find ways to cope  with it differently or avoid it if you don't find another solution yet."
fuckeatingdisorders,foful3s,t3_g79s1d,1587743090.0,"I understand really much. My boyfriend told me the other day ""I love your new kilos"" I the first thing I had in mind was ""FUCK I'm not gonna eat anymore"". But we are focusing on the wrong part of this information. You said yourself your boyfriend was ecstatic, and he doesn't have any eating disorder filter in his eyes, unlike you. You are looking really good now, you can believe your boyfriend's eyes much more than yours. You don't need to check whatever kilos / water kilos you gained, it's not as important as the fact that you are looking much better without ED than with it."
EdAnonymousAdults,foequyp,t3_g6q4b5,1587711679.0,"I feel it so much. I have this image sometimes in my head of my eating disorder. It's like some kind of big guy with just a dark / shadowed face that I cannot see but he is smiling and I begin to fight against him in my mind, I punch him and scrape him and bite it with all my strength, I want to destroy every fucking member of this thing. Sometimes I do this while walking in the street and I feel my arms and all my muscles get tensed because I'm inside this scene in my head, and I'm walking in the middle of all those normal people going through their normal lives.    
When you feel so angry against all these maybe try to picture yourself your eating disorder and imagine what you would tell him / her. What you would do to him / her. And punch if you feel like it, punch the walls and punch pillows and break things if you want. Even if it's taking the form of anger right now you have all this energy you describe inside you, so there is no chance you loose this battle."
EdAnonymousAdults,fnz0c88,t3_g3v9ck,1587382214.0,"Hey, first it's not a relapse that removes all the progresses you made during the 4 last years. It's a relapse, it happens, and you can decide to get back on track when you want.

Maybe a scale is not the best idea in this case. Did the scale ever triggered some good feelings or helped in any way for you ? If yes maybe keep it but otherwise just drop it. 

Last thing I would add, even if it can sound completely impossible or super hard to do, you should really talk about this with your spouse. Opening always helps muuuuuch more than we think / can imagine. 

I avoided talking about my eating disorder to my partner for a year and tried to heal and recover alone and one day I exploded and said everything. His reaction was completely unexpectedly soft and supportive and I made more progresses the next two weeks just knowing he is fighting on my side, than the last two years alone.

And finally you don't need to know exactly what is your point to write here, it's just cool that you write."
