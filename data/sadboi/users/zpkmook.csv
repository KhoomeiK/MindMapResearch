relationships,ewczvw4,t3_cnql2p,1565292897.0,"With my ex for almost 4 years. Lived together the entire time basically. It took me a good 5 months to get myself together fully. I wanted to contact them the minute they left but didn't want to push anything, I was so confused and a nervous mess and the feelings were still hot.  I didn't want to be used for sex when I still loved them and hated myself so I turtled.  I was more or less fine the first two months and then started to fall apart, all my mourning was delayed and turned into nervous energy doing things until I was on Holiday breaks with extra time. Then I felt like absolute dogshit and was all over the place with extra burdens (moving, job stress, a cat to keep or give away, a roomate in and out, the decisions were overwhelming). I did all the things NOT to do at this point. I didn't understand how to get control. I was really a wreck. I would do very well and little setbacks in life would turn me on a dime. You can use this rush of energy to get things accomplished; I fasted 5 days on water and then bulked up at the gym, and pushed hard to narrow my future career choices.

So be careful with any extra burdens/changes the first 6 months I say. And once you do start dating take it very slow (6 months will make you a better person alone and make sure you are over them to the point you make good choices). One person at a time and don't rush the relation or sex; remember A LOT of people suck and they can hurt you more when your not at your best and sex just makes them closer to you quicker.  Beat off before dates and have your friends evaluate them so you aren't trying to just get some and rebound hard. Wait at least 5 dates before sex is my advice as well. Otherwise you can EASILY fall back into the same bad habits of the last realtionship and your life if you were that codependent. 

Put what not to do up on a wall or something and what to do next it and don't deviate!

 When I got very sick recently for several weeks after a spat of bad dates it took me back there. Anytime I'm very sad or something reminds me of them it's a gut punch. I'm mad at myself for not seeking advice sooner instead of letting the relation fall apart and me feeling paralyzed. I didn't realize how fucking stupid I can act when I feel ignored or snubbed by a love one. I hate myself for hurting them as well.  I guess they can relate since they always wanted more loving words which are hard for me coming from my unexpressive family. Family was no help, actually they gave pretty bad advice or just ignored me ... Ironically the breakup made me realize all the great things about the ex and my feelings poured out like a mad poet or emo kid. Sad.

  So really it can come and go. They say it can take about half the time you were together to fully get over them. But it really is different for each person and their relationship I think.


I recommend you do something with friends that you can talk with them or go to a therapist. Relationship hero is a decent service because therapists can be expensive and time consuming.  Also take up your favorite exercise. The sauna also greatly clears my head of negative feelings."

relationships,ewc0psz,t3_cnkgdg,1565275566.0,"Having dealt with a very insecure gf it takes a lot of time and trust and small things can build against you. It takes more time and mental energy to deal with these things! Honestly it can wear you out over time... and makes it more likely for you to cheat or act like you will because of the resentment that builds and when you find yourself without friends and having very little interaction with other females for a long period of time. My female friends advice always helped me in relations but I felt the dread in talking to them because of what my ex because she didn't want me talking to them. You can find youself in a deep hole and it's so difficult to get out that it may be easier to end the relation. ;(


In talking to people you build up your database of interactions and gain experience and when cut off your practice level goes way down over time and leaves you more vulnerable to exploitation and general stupidity because you depend on your SO so much. 

 So ironically it helped to destruct my relationship, especially over time. And when they want to leave and you realize the situation you are in it can make you bitter with resentment which of course leads to stupid things and then cue in your lack of friends/female advice (or new ones that aren't familiar and give bad advice) compounding the situation. In essence I felt I was in a whirlwind of stupidity and fear that I couldn't just see from outside of myself and didn't have anyone to talk to about."

Always sitting and listening to their problems without being able to suggest solutions or have pretty much no input besides agreeing and letting them continue because they get mad if you do and suddenly you become the problem. 

Almost always being seen as responsible for the outcome of almost anything by society at large. Being the disposable sex.  

The problem of knowing they can leave you and get a new man quickly where you have to work very hard for it. Similarly having to take most of the initiative in starting and ending relations. Usually you get passive aggressive behavior and have to fix it or know when to get out when they won’t even tell you or know what the actual problems are. Women can break up with men and get back with them easier because of all this. This has really trashed my psyche before. It’s hard to know if they really mean it or they want you to prove yourself and win them back etc or you just believe them. This extreme push pull behavior is maddening. 

 Initiating sex or denying it and being judged for it.  The emotional labor of hard labor and stoicism or conversely being the opposite type of man and being judged for it. 
Moreover just trying to please your SO especially in the social media age.  You don’t need a perfect Instagram ass you just should stay in shape. Helping to manage a woman’s bodily self image/self esteem-the classic does this make me look fat? dilemma on social media steroids

In dating it’s juggling the sexual attraction and contact with the metoo era and yet looking out for your own interests too in not being insulting. Attractive women literally make men dumber and this can be used against men easily. 

Having your hobbies be denigrated if they aren’t manly productive  things; video games are seen as children’s things for instance. 


It’s a fine line in managing the sex drive; you can’t be too horny or not horny at all or they assume you have problems. Women also judge men for using porn or masturbating and having to keep this totally concealed even if it’s “fine” is another issue.  Couple this with attractive women making men dumber and the need for post nut clarity and you can find yourself in this neurotic world maze .  Women being jealous and insecure of men as well and doesn’t expect this to have an effect which can affect someone over time. In essence as a man you just take any emotion and have to transform it to a positive whatever.

Not talking or even realizing problems with your own mental health in dealing with life circumstances because you are focused on the SO/family in terms of importance. . Men don’t get depressed and don’t need anything for it /s. You can just throw yourself into more work right guys?  also I have found the way most therapy is structured is more for the benefit of women, sometimes I want my therapist to be a hard ass that inspires me to be strong.  Men don’t support each other as much as women do, so they rely on their SO and this is another reason men do worse after breakups.  women have it so much harder so men don’t need anything at all right? /s

Women crying and being emotional hooks men’s helping white knight responses and can be used to manipulate them easier. Men who don’t help are often seen as callous assholes. Catch 22. Combine this with women’s attractive power and you’ve created /r/pussypass 

Women getting the lions share of how the household is managed/decorated etc and you have to adapt to it.

In a nutshell for male MA, patients tend to complain more if you aren't totally perfect for them.  Also it's a PITA for us to have to get chaperones to do every EKG even though you could be homosexual or bisexual negating the point.

In short the MA profession is heavily biased towards females and that's why most of them are female. I would say the profession in general is not respected for the medical field. (certainly better than your restaurant or retail worker though).

Always get a blood test that’s current and ask their history and always wear condoms for the first 3 months because that’s how long some things can take to show and how long it takes to really know someone! Go monogamous! It’s not worth the mutual risk otherwise. And then get a retest. That’s how you be sure. I’d also avoid anal as it is higher risk for both parties. 
Ladies and gents both; always carry condoms of a couple types and water based lube. 1-2 drops inside the condom makes it way more comfortable! 

 I’d recommend a type of reputable ones and magnums for uncut men. 
Just so y’all know condoms only offer 30-50% protections from HSV for MEN with proper use. Around 80% for women.  Still low risk but condoms obviously aren’t great for HSV or HPV for that matter.  Inspecting the other party during foreplay is a good call; familiarize yourself with STI  appearances.

My self worth and value plummeted leading me into worse job performance, and worse coping habits; eating shit, drinking more, tinder dates I would never actually date if I stopped to consider it etc)."

Nootropics,eqf8ci3,t1_eqe9lw0,1560016718.0,Don't end up a real life sex addict;that's  far more dangerous.
AskReddit,eqbuijz,t3_bxtqdb,1559956788.0,"Myself. I make stupid decisions and do things I know are bad for me but can’t help myself sometimes. Being depressed makes me take more risk in a bad way and less risk in a good way. Lose lose situations.  It’s a viscous cycle. 

I get burned by other people too easily because I’m too trusting and allow myself to be taken advantage of. I freeze like a deer in the headlights in the critical moments like a fucking child and stick my head in the sand with distraction. I can’t focus on what’s truly important long term. 

I don’t know how to assert myself calmly or at all sometimes, I feel powerless to say what I truly feel like I can’t break social convention without taking the  time to rev myself up in a way that’s unsustainable so I feel trapped in the sunken place except mine is of distraction and a learned helplessness.  I feel like my environment shapes me far more than I it and thus I am powerless to affect the big things and only can affect the small. When I fight back I get infantilized and break. 

I can’t hurt other people unless they hurt me first so I end up on the losing side getting piecemealed as a reactionary. I think I’ve healed from one thing and then another comes to beat me down before I’m healed because of the cycle. And now I’m at the bottom and it just sucks.  I can’t stand my flaws. Every time I date I jump in too quickly and usually regret it. 
Every romantic relationship I have the same issue with :the person falls out of love with me and I can’t escape. They didn’t truly know me or love me ever and just used me as a means to an end. I’m my own worst enemy and I’m not strong enough to fix it.

I struggle to keep myself on a regular schedule because of the “look,squirrel!” Novelty, my head in the clouds  and my general fuxkaround itis and emotional trauma. I don’t have a group of friends that keeps me on track reliably. My life feels like a it’s on the balance of a knife and I fuck shit up so frequently I’d rather not participate at all or at least follow the mundanity of my existence so I don’t get hurt more than I have."
STD,epsu2j4,t3_bj9j7j,1559466484.0,Possibly if initiated at a high dose ASAP after contact. It may not completely prevent an infection but may make it milder due to reduction of latent viral load in the neurons. Apparently famvir is actually the drug of choice for prevention because of less frequent dosing and higher half life.  There’s a case report of a medical worker getting an accidental needle stick from HSV1 and taking famvir immediately (250 mg TID within an hour of exposure and for 7 days recommended). This was based on animal studies in mice I believe.
PlantarFasciitis,ep2cq8f,t3_btqfy6,1559006426.0,I've read the Tenjet procedure is now the superior preferred procedure.
PrequelMemes,eozqmm8,t3_btjz7j,1558964969.0,"Sunscreen SPF doesn’t count UV-A protection. Generally higher spf the higher the  UV-A protection but it’s absolutely not 1-1. More like 6-1. Certain sunscreen offers much better protection,particularly Asian and European ones as they have filters that are stronger but not yet approved in the US.  
And uv-a ages and tans you. People are dumb as they don’t understand this and sunscreen manufacturers are playing an old propaganda game on this by focusing on irrelevant issues to sell their inferior products."
