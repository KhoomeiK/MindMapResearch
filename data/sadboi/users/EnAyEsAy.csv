loseit,fpcwkfg,t1_fpcvdpa,1588514559.0,"Sometimes whenever I would eat over my maintenance, my body would cling onto that water weight for two weeks! So annoying. I’d plateau, too. But then all of a sudden it would drop on the scale. One setback won’t ruin your progress, I promise. Give it some more time. If it hasn’t changed in about a month, try reshaping your routine and cut back some and it should help it go down. Good luck!"
loseit,fpcvjk1,t1_fpcudiu,1588513838.0,"Hi there! I’ve lost weight before but have gained it back so I’m trying again, so I’m newish to this, too. Personally, I would start off with something small and easy to do to ease yourself into a workout routine. Whenever I would go straight into it and all out, I would either A.) hurt myself or B.) hate it so much I would just give up. So it wouldn’t hurt to do some small pushups/sit-ups/etc if you’re comfortable with that, but I’d team it up with some cardio (walking, swimming, etc). Ease yourself into it to build that habit. Some days I would just work out to a dance song for 5 minutes and that would be that. Also, only do workouts you enjoy or can tolerate. I despise running and only trying to force myself to run makes me hate exercise more, lol. So I stick to walking, riding a bike, swimming, some pilates, because I enjoy them!

Diet tips: same thing! Ease yourself into it. Add some veggies to meals, slowly grow your portions to be mostly veggies. Hunger is going to be a pain in the beginning, so don’t feel discouraged. There have been days I couldn’t take it and I would binge, so the next day I would try to cut my calories a little bit at a time to find a sustainable deficit. What I’ve found helps is eating a small meal (like a Lean Cuisine) with a meal replacement shake (Slimfit). Helps keep the hunger down for a good bit and gives me that protein! 

I also have mantras to help me stick to weight loss. If I want to binge, I’ll remind myself that I won’t remember that amount of food I just ate in a month, but I’ll remember that regret. I also made a list of reasons why I want to lose weight (feel better, lower blood pressure, be able to move more, etc.). And always: if I fail and binge, DO NOT GIVE UP. One set back will not ruin everything. Pick yourself up and keep trying. It gets easier.

I’m sure there’s more advice others have that work for you, but this is what works for me! Good luck and proud of you for taking this journey!

ETA: some details to workouts!"

While I am excited to start a different type of pharmacy (I’ve only ever worked retail pharmacy), I’m anxious. We have to wear masks and PPE of course, but we have to deliver medicines to COVID floors. I don’t believe we have to go into patients’ rooms, but that doesn’t negate the fact that I’m going to be around infected people. I’m just scared no matter what precautions I take I’m going to fall ill and die. I’m 23 years old and have no other known preexisting conditions and it still scares me.

Another thing I would get first is the storage upgrade for your pockets. It’ll extend it by a row so you have 3 rows instead of two, which is very useful. There’s another one as well that upgrades it to four!"

My roommate works in fast food a lot, but he also invites a friend over or goes over to a friend’s apartment and visits them. We’ve told him to not bring people over and he agreed, but last weekend he brought two friends from out of state to the apartment. Granted he stays in his room like 90% of the time, but we share a bathroom and kitchen obviously. We don’t want to be rude, but it worries us that we might come into contact with the virus if he keeps seeing other people. We’re sacrificing time with our friends to be safe. 

Is it possible to contract the virus if we’re not around him closely? I forgot to wash my hands after touching some of his stuff and then ate/touched my face, so obviously my anxiety is ramped now. And I don’t want to be mean to him because he’s our friend, but jeez I just don’t feel comfortable with him going out a lot to work AND be around his friends."
