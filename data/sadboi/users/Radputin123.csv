Cuphead,fntlx7l,t3_g3sb7u,1587244298.0,I always thought you should press the party button on the pink object... It took me over 10 lives to figure out it I had to party before

Cuphead,fmtup3c,t1_fmrysf8,1586379328.0,"IDK, but I do remember that one of the journalists that played the game at e3 took 20 mins to complete the jump and dash part of the tutorial"
Cuphead,fmrw727,t3_fwuowa,1586337721.0,I was just scrolling through comments and saw no one said tutorial as the worst level. It's a miracle!

AskReddit,ffxgsrq,t3_evnzey,1580324848.0,I'm gonna dive straight into the deep end. Suicide thoughts and everything that comes with it. I've been their before and it blinds you from the good things in life.
SuicideWatch,ffwtezc,t1_ffw9dr0,1580310577.0,Thanks ❤️

SuicideWatch,fen0ykj,t3_d2370x,1579274523.0,"I can already guess the answer but I'm believe I'm suffering from my views of the world. As you can see I know that I hate the world and everything in it but I don't believe it, so I do nothing... Anyway, back to what I originally wanted to ask. If I make a post basically saying how rubbish society is and what it's built on, mainly relating to attitude towards sexuality, is that allowed. Blimey, that was a mouthful."
SuicideWatch,fehcp72,t3_ep1muw,1579113847.0,"Hey there, erm, Emma. Look, I don't know if I'm talking to anyone at all, judging by how many hours have passed since this comment was first uploaded. I'm not gonna tell you not to kill yourself, that stuff doesn't work anymore. Instead, is suicide the only answer to your problems. Suicide may well be the answer, but what is the question? If this is anything like a maths question that means there's multiple answers. Why not explore the other answers before it's too late. Hope you all the best"
SuicideWatch,fdzj9et,t1_fdzfwi7,1578790743.0,"I'd like to hope you well in the future, no matter what you do. Sorry for my rant, I just wrote it mindlessly. If you need any help, sure I may not be the best person to ask, but I sure will try my best, because hopefully I will be able to save someone from the clutches of death before my time comes."
SuicideWatch,fdzfwi7,t3_enakk8,1578789848.0,"I got help once but never again. I literally talked about everything thing I was going through for 2+ hours and at the end the woman said something like ""well let's work on fixing those problems"". I was literally about to stand up and shout ""that's why I came to you!!!"" At the top of my voice. Seriously, unless your talking to someone who knows what it feels like to live this toment we call life, they'll probably just look at you blankly and say ""stop being suicidal"""
