You knew she couldn't communicate with the other dogs, that Maggie has no frustration tolerance and requires her space be respected, yet they are still allowed to run freely? You let a six year old child handle a barking dog who was going to be targeted by the returning Maggie, and didn't coordinate that Maggie be kept on a leash until order was established and Maggie was calm--both from excitement of errands and excitement from Lucy.

I would bet you Lucy knew she was in danger, that's why she bit--except she's blind and can't find the actual threat.

You now have a dog that deliberately killed another, one they grew up with, for no better reason than ""it was loud"" and she was off leash. What's going to happen when your puppy gets excited and starts yelling, and Maggie doesn't like it? If the puppy tries to play and Maggie takes offense? What about your own child, why on Earth do you think she's exempt from Maggie's rules? She's a child, you not being aware of the situation and allowing her to open the door is what caused this. You didn't anticipate this, despite that you should have. How can you possibly expect a child to be safe and make situationally aware decisions about the dog when you haven't so far? 

How are you going to handle the risk of accidents? You have to anticipate and plan and be perfect, while Maggie needs only one slip. The odds are you'll fail, that's just statistics. Fences can break and be jumped or dug out. People can cross fences and ignore beware of dog signs. Children can't be held responsible for being irresponsible--it's comparable to having guns in the house, and again the problem of needing only one slip.

None of this is Maggie's fault. The problem you have now is the fact she can't be trusted around children and other animals. That's perfectly normal--some dogs need to be an only dog without children. You can take the risk that nothing will happen in the next seven years, or you can find her a home where there are no children and no other pets. That's safest for both her and for other people. Maggie should get to have a full life, not locked up and treated like a risk for things that aren't her fault. You would all get full lives, that are better and safer for everyone involved. And Maggie wouldn't be under constant risk of biting or killing a dog or person, which means she wouldn't be at risk of other people demanding she be put down all because she's kept in risky situations she has no control over."

Edit: comments weren't showing up, just caught up. Taking just the ovaries is not standard, that's a boutique special request made by people who think spaying dogs is bad because it's ""unnatural"" to not have hormones and cycles. Same stupidity behind people outaged over human contraceptives.

Problem with a tattoo is that you never know what's going to happen so the whole thing could get skinned off in a road rash, if you get hit by a truck. Something sufficiently damaging that it could be invoked, but it not itself damaged, seems kinda odd."

it's funny how everyone here is like ""there are problems we can't solve"" and then go on to blame the client for the very problems just said to be unsolvable. denying this very observable fact is why people think therapy is bullshit to begin with and why people think therapists are just out to string you along to make money, and not actually help. therapists believe all the same crap that ""the average person"" does, you're supposed to unlearn it and not reinforce it: ""you can do anything you put your mind to"" being one of the biggest offenders. we tell that to children because they literally cannot understand this stuff until they're older. but adults and people likely to show up in therapy know you're full of shit.  just like MD doctors are supposed to unlearn their common hatred for fat people, and it's real easy to smell it on them despite their """"""professional opinion""""""""."

no, that ""needs heirarchy"" is bullshit. people who worry about basic survival, who don't have basic safety covered, also think and worry about everything else. humans aren't video game avatars that only unlock ""higher level skills"" once you get enough XP. people are full humans in all classes."
