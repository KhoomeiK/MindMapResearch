I know its nerve-racking though, but if you really like him a lot you might regret it if you guys go on like nothing happened and you'll always contemplate the reason as to why he suddenly reacted like that. It is tough though. In the long run, its better to be honest and open just so you don't have any regrets. If he says he doesn't like you - it'll be easier to move on because you'll get closure and reassurance from that. If he says he likes you great! If he says he likes you but can't have anything with you, then you'll know to move on. It's a tough thing to do but at least you'll know"
TrueFilm,f6feccd,t1_f6f1rxz,1572813424.0,"This is a really strong point - why do we feel the need to orient ourselves instead of just allowing the experience to take place? Why must we constantly seek comfort in what we know? Why do we tend to let our emotions get in the way of our intellectual judgment? Your example of Mulholland drive also makes me curious about whether something can only be uncanny if it is not understood. Is it possible for an uncanny atmosphere to exist if we can comprehend everything that's taking place however not entirely be sure of its purpose? (e.g the 'in heaven' scene in Eraserhead)   

These questions would be good to look into in my dissertation so thanks for bringing all of this into question. Am excited to explore some more experimental films and check out Sokurov and Grandrieux - Thank you!"
TrueFilm,f6fbr9b,t1_f6ezgv2,1572812611.0,oooooooo yes My Winnipeg is a great suggestion actually. I've got a lot of room to introduce the concept of the uncanny which means I'll probably do a whole section on surrealism and how that often can make its way into the uncanny. A surrealist mockumentary would also bring in a super unique perspective  so thanks!
TrueFilm,f6fax4j,t1_f6f1kov,1572812383.0,"I've always been super hesitant about what salò but you're right, it's basically a perfect representation of the uncanny so looks like I've gotta do it now.

TrueFilm,f6f9zoy,t1_f6f7802,1572812108.0,"Thank you!  I think I'll be focusing on how the uncanny can be used as a means of revealing hidden truths ... almost as if the strangeness can unravel  layers of reality and reveal things we wouldn't have realised if we weren't put into an uncanny situation. Kinda like how we can occasionally miss the meaning of things when they're hidden in plain sight but when we're thrown into discomfort and unfamiliarity we become more alert and aware. Haven't done much reading & research yet though so the general direction is definitely subject to change. Yep for sure am keen on including that in my diss - it's 10,000 words so I've got plenty of room to discuss all of that. Thank you for the suggestions!!"
TrueFilm,f5k8vrc,t3_do10sx,1572257837.0,"Not sure if this is an unpopular opinion but I loved eyes wide shut because I felt like it was one big puzzle. Ofcourse, kubrick films always have had underlying meanings, heavy symbolism and often a mind game element but I felt that EWS was less subtle with this. I also really enjoyed how you really felt like you were joining Tom on this night of crazy adventure as there’s that voyeuristic element that makes you feel as if you’re the only one who knows about everything that’s happened to him. The whole films so secretive and that aspect of it made it feel even more secretive, as if you’re keeping a secret for him."

I'm really new to this whole concept and I've never even heard about it much until recently, so I've been finding it hard to understand what films fit into being 'magic realist' ones.

Then when they are adults they can go to you themselves and finally have that loving father that they deserve. It doesn’t matter that they’ll only have access to their father in their adult life, that access still counts and makes an enormous impact in their lives. Seriously, you not being there for 18 years is worth you being there for the 30 + years after...
