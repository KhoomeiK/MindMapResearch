ChronicPain,fg1sx8s,t1_fg10ull,1580432729.0,"On Facebook there is a failed back surgery syndrome site.  I just am tired of being blamed.  I was healthy.  I just went to see a rheumatologist and found bursitis.  She referred me to her husband the PM.  He got this new equipment to inject cortisone.  He went crazy and with every injection I got worse.  I don’t think 6 cortisone shots in six weeks isn’t normal.  I had bouts of sciatica pain.  I cured it through rest and muscle relaxants.  Stenosis was minor, bend down and just sit.  My pain was managed without anything but some Ibuprofen.  With all that cortisone, my stenosis got worse.  All of a sudden this doctor dumped me saying I really needed back surgery.  He just gave me a month script and I was on my own.  If he hadn’t been so arrogant, he would have just waited for everything to wear out.  So, I ended up having a surgery, it appeared I needed.  If he would have LISTENED AND READ my prior records he would have just given me pain meds until the cortisone stabilized.  I didn’t realize this until doing research.  The only thing I needed was time."
ChronicPain,fg0zpfc,t1_ffwtbhp,1580418142.0,"Are you on the failed back surgery syndrome site?  I am.  Someone said they had problems due to L5.  I was NEVER told this would be a side effect.  I even had surgery on my feet because I was told by my PM that since my stimulator didn’t help, I should see a podiatrist.  After a year, I went to another podiatrist.  I told him I could barely walk and told him because of my inactivity, I might just have a heart attack.  He said go see a neurosurgeon.  The neurosurgeon won’t see me until I have my medical records which are in  totally different city.  I took a really bad fall, the hospital did nothing because I fell back and had those measuring bins fall on me at the airport.  Since, I was able to sit through a flight and in pain management.  No ex rays.  My PM felt my back and I almost screamed.  He said to rest.  I was forced to go see my PCP to get ex-rays.  He wasn’t too interested in my feet, only said the pulse was very low in my feet.  Here is what he was concerned about.  I was born with a heart murmur.  On a scale of 1-6, mine was now a three.  I can’t even do a stress test so they are doing something else.  I think the thing that is worrying the cardiologist is that I don’t get exercise and it will get bad.  One arrogant coward who wouldn’t admit to his mistake.  The cardiologist said after his examination said whatever was going on had nothing to do with my feet only agreed that exercise could cause serious problems in the future."
ChronicPain,fg0whkj,t1_ffx1999,1580416389.0,"I keep getting told it is neuropathy, I just find it had to believe, surgery gives you neuropathy.  All I want is for someone to just try to understand.  It sounds funny, it isn’t.  Put a pebble in your shoe.  Now imagine it bigger and not just one.  More like six in each foot and even rubber bands around your toes.  It sounds funny.  It is very real to me."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fg0u5sv,t3_evx1jr,1580415083.0,"I want to tell you one thing.  The spiritual part.  You said you would never have a relationship with your father.  I get it 100%.  I just think that there might be a part of you who loves him.  Keep the door 1/2 an inch cracked.  My father has stolen $30,000.00 from me.  I told you some other things.  My son got furious with me and beat me up he said I deserved it.  Now, with him joining forces with my ex to help her father so she hates me, that is unforgivable.  I NEED an apology, he is Catholic and he will never apologize because he just goes to confession and a priest gives him absolution.  I am not Catholic, that doesn’t matter, being a person who actually feels remorse and says they are sorry is what makes you a better person.  You are 25, I am 55.  My father is eighty.  He knows exactly what he needs to do.  I have to deal with him dying.  I have a feeling your father is younger.  Because someone asks forgiveness doesn’t mean you just jump back on the bandwagon.  Atonement, that is after saying sorry.  That is when you accept your wrong doings and do everything to fix things.  I have hope with my father.  I will accept his apology unfortunately I will not let him hurt me.  You can do the same.  I think everyone has different things they want as atonement and sometimes the wounds are too deep.  He can apologize and you can accept.  You can tell him, I need time to get my life together and I need this to grow.  If you ever see a change that meets your expectations, at least he has apologized and then you can go to him.  I am fearful my father will die and decide to say he is sorry as he dies.  Just do what you are doing, there are many places to get therapy for free.  You can PM me if you want."

I felt like I was trying to really bring this woman to reality and what the consequences could be if she continued this way.  I opened up immensely from my own personal experience.  I really tried to mirror what she was saying.  If a therapist isn’t needed here, I will leave the room.  Please accept my sincerest apologies.  No one has ever complained about my methods and have usually been grateful."

LifeAfterNarcissism,ffytcup,t3_evx1jr,1580354643.0,"Sexual, emotional, and physical abuse over a long period of time causes PTSD.  First, get over some bad things I bet you have gone through or it is still happening.  Eating Disorder.  My father wasn’t my abuser, my ex-husband was.  I discovered bulemia was so empowering.  Then came self mutilation.  It range from Trichotillomania to cutting. I have a feeling maybe you have gone through this.  I also spent most of my career investigating abuse to under 17 year olds.  Only a small number didn’t do these things.  If this is going on get to therapy.  No 12 step programs.  Twelve step programs are antiquated.  See a psychiatrist, you might just need some antidepressants for a short period of time.  Some people have acute depression and some chronic.  You gave a lot of surface information except when you said you kept hearing your father’s voice.  I have been through all this.  I developed, bulemia, trichotrallimania, drinking to get drunk, drug abuse and even sexual addiction.  Nothing was letting me move forward.  When, I just couldn’t move forward I developed agoraphobia.  The agoraphobia got so bad all I could do was just stay on my bed.  I was fearful of everything.  I finally attempted suicide.  I had to quit my job.  I had spent years counseling women and children who suffered abuse at the hands of a loved one.  I felt the justice system would help more and even went to law school.  I was trying to keep my mind busy.  Finally, my psychiatrist insisted I see a therapist who specialized in EMDR. It stands for eye movement desensitization and reprocessing.  It works!  I used to cry three or four times a day.  Thoughts of my daughter telling me she hated me because her father brainwashed her.  I was paralyzed.  My mind couldn’t even focus on a television show.  I started that therapy and after 3 sessions the hurtful things I kept hearing were gone.  I remembered how much I loved my daughter; however knew any reconciliation would have to come from her.  I was then able Move forward and Give my husband who I loved but was too busy living in the past.  We are happy.  I am happy and doing things like being here and hopefully helping.  I am writing stories and doing artwork.  You have nothing to lose and maybe everything to gain."
ChronicPain,ffwkm60,t3_evel10,1580303997.0,"I just have one question to ask you.  Would you buy an over priced, color that you hate coat that doesn’t fit?    No!  Hell, no.  Remember the bottom line for doctors is that they WANT you to buy their services.  No, more!  They need to suit our needs which are pretty basic.  Listen read, write, and be kind.  Don’t we deserve it.  They demand it.  Fuck that shit from now on!  I am a consumer of their services.  Just like the man who fixes my drains, cleans my pool, paints my home and my mechanic!  I want everything fixed properly and dealt with respect.  If they don’t do that donyou this tell them where to go.  Doctors are no different.  It is actually worth it to me to leave my state to get better medical care.  I am worth much more than all the crap doctors have given me.  What’s worse, I,paid for it.  Never again."
MayansMC,ffwhuue,t1_ffvi268,1580301536.0,"No, I just have an extensive knowledge of how cartels work.  I had two bother in law’s highly connected.  One was I charge of distribution .  One was the pilot the other was a high tanking man in ten Federal government in charge of the drug force.  I really think I know my shit. Do you?  Plus, I in no way being racist.  I included many different scenarios, the wealthiest people.  Royalty.  Italian mafia.  It is just an unspoken racist view, we do live in this type of country and it is unspoken and true. One other thing, I am allergic to caffeine.  Unless, you are a psychologist don’t call me bipolar.  Besides having a law degree, my two bachelor’s degree are in psychology and biology.  I seriously recommend a psychology degree to anyone."
MayansMC,ffv6d5e,t1_ffunjkl,1580256748.0,"My thoughts exactly.  The only reason I went with someone else is because Montez is too obvious.  I want it to be Montez so the Sons can find out that Montez was a traitor and there would be no Mayan/ Sons war.  To me that would kind of suck!  I think Taza killed Riz hoping the MC would go to war with the Maldito’s.  The Mayans need to deal with their own internal struggles.  I absolutely hate that Kurt Sutter isn’t a part of Mayans, it has its advantages like that he didn’t write the characters of the Sons.  They aren’t in his forefront.  Hopefully, Mayans 2ill deal with Mayans next season."
MayansMC,ffub0aw,t1_ffj839w,1580238195.0,"I will say not how I feel, what I know!  Jose Galindo was alive when Emily married Miguel, correct?  Jose would have NEVER given his blessing to Emily marrying Miguel because she wasn’t Hispanic.  It is like the Prince of ENGLAND marrying a Jew.  Nope!   It is like the Prince of Dubai marrying a Hispanic woman.  Yes, these relationships occur never through the bond of marriage.  I know a lot about this, never would Emily married into into the Galindo family.  She is so ashamed she herself said she she alienated herself.  In a cartel family Galindo Thomas just doesn’t fly!  Yes, this is how they say names in Spanish.  Husband last name first and then maiden name or you are Thomas de Galindo, with a pretty strange connotation.  Meaning you are Emily Thomas belonging to Miguel Galindo.  In Emily’s world that flies.  I grew up along the Mexican border.  Lots of cartel action.  These men and women never marry outside their tightly knit group.  Their children marry women who know the life agree and are Hispanic.  Anglo women to these men are never brought into the circle.  They have them as mistresses.  Even the freaking Italian mafia is like this.  Watch Goodfellas, Godfather, The Irishman.  They don’t marry outside.  I am JEWISH, would NEVER think of marrying someone who isn’t.  I am also , Hispanic, in my case religion trumps race.  This is why there is such a disconnect with Emily.  Let’s even go deeper, Hispanic men used to see these pale white women as a prize.  It can be offensive to Hispanic women.  I heard this in the Spanish community and in the African American communities.  That has changed a lot.  However, just look at families that come from massive fortunes are they really allowed to marry a woman who comes from a family who lives in a lower middle class family.  If you said, yes, I want to hear one billionaire family who has let their child marry a person from an impoverished family.  The freaking Royal family doesn’t like Meagan Markle.  She is American, she has a vast fortune.  See, it is just the way of the world."
MayansMC,ffu7it2,t1_ffjt8ed,1580236129.0,"Well, yes.  Things are very different in Mexico.  It isn’t uncommon for twelve year olds to do hits. They do it or they are dead and their family.  Living in this environment for poverty stricken children is normal.  I think Adelita has evolved and is fiercely protective of Minnie.  She spends a lot more time with her than Emily spends with her own son."
MayansMC,ffu6v78,t3_eu09x7,1580235740.0,"Not as a lawyer.  She really can’t practice law because of Miguel’s business.  That is why she has all think time to be such a budinsky.  Plus, have clandestine meetings with EZ.  Stay up as late as she wants chain smoking and drinking a bottle of merlot.  At one point in my life, I left my career, why?  I had a child.  I wanted to care for my child.  When I went to work, I got a nanny, when I got home, she went and did whatever.  It was my time.  This dumbass won’t even take care of her kid.  Like I said.  If she was smart enough to get through law school, she learned nothing."
MayansMC,ffu5w7p,t1_ffpr8yl,1580235156.0,"I wonder.  We know Miguel has an MBA.  This just shows another weak point in Emily.  I believe in love; however, I would never sacrifice my career to be married to a drug lord.  I married into a cartel family.  I was 16.  I had no idea.  I left when everyone got arrested and my in- law’s involvement was deep.  Going to the federal major in the Air Force.  I left that messed up family to pursue my career.  I went to law school and it is just as easy to fall I love with a cartel boss as it is to fall in love with someone in your field.  Whatever she is.  She was well aware of who Miguel was and even if he sold her into believing he would never touch the business.  She is exactly where she wants to be and needs to stop moaning.  She wants to be cartel boss.  I won’t feel sorry for her when her kid gets kidnapped or when she gets struck by a bullet.  Her life is so fucked right now.  Her degrees mean nothing.  The only future she has is a bullet to Miguel or Cristobal unless Coco gets them.  Then again, he often says after a shoot my bad.  Maybe she can work at a Dairy Queen as a waitress in the witness protection program."
ChronicPain,ffu3od8,t1_fft52iw,1580233802.0,"What doctors don’t realize I that WE deserve the best treatment because it is THEIR fault we are in those conditions.  If you are taking opioids for pain and go see a new PM.  They will want to start at day one with all their stupid procedures who make you worse.  They don’t care if you are on opioids, a new PM is not likely to prescribe.  It is so messed up because they don’t read your records.  They take your far off look or inability to immediately answer a question meaning you are high from previous opioid use.  They don’t realize you are using all your fucking brainpower just to get through the pain.  There is NO OPIOID CRISIS.  Well, ok, there is.  It is cops who are too busy at the donut shop filling their FAT FACES.  They need to keep dealers in check because 40% of opioid deaths are heroin related, 10% are intentional suicides.  The CDC has no numbers regarding pill mill doctors, unqualified doctors, such as any other doctor you can fool, plus we also don’t know how many people are buying pills on the black market.  It is so hard to find a new PM, until every patient thinks of it this way.  You never buy a coat in a color you don’t like that doesn’t fit you, correct?  You are the consumer.  A doctor is charging you for every bandage he put on you.  My doctor bills over $5000.00 for a drug test, then another one does also.  I am the freaking consumer!  My coat is going to fit, it is going to be the color I want and going to fit MY needs.  Doctors are a business.  You are purchasing their services.  Until, every patient in this country understands that doctors are vendors, shit like what has happened to you and me an millions of other Americans, doctors will never have to become better doctors.  Move on if you can.  It might be easy for me to say this.  My life is worth something and I am leaving my fucked up state where medical marijuana will NEVER be legal.

It isn’t neuropathy because gabipentin doesn’t work.  In the first surgery the butcher messed up.  He was an arrogant coward who said his surgery had nothing to do with his surgery.  Funny, if there was one thing, I never skimped on shoes.  My mom owned a shoe store and I used to see women come in with totally messed up feet.  Now here I am struggling because yes there is something wrong in my back, it just is just whatever pain someone might have because of little things.  Nothing that a hot shower or laying down won’t fix.  I have pain in my legs at night.  My knees are giving out and the spinal cord stimulator does help that, nothing for my feet.  
I am so tired of my pain doctor.  They sent me to an addiction specialist.  He is in no way an addiction specialist.  To him, everyone is an addict.  I took a really bad fall at the airport with a metal shelf that fell on me.  I was in horrible pain.  No one gave a damn.  The hospital was go see your pain management doctor, you have pain meds.  Both doctors at pain management, said, reprogram your stimulator.  I need ex-rays.  I have fibromyalgia and opioids do work.  I have stayed on 15 mgs of Percocet a day because of the alleged opioid crisis, that has NOTHING to do with with us.  That is a whole other discussion.  I just hate that they think the spinal cord stimulator fixes everything.  I finally went to see another doctor in another city.  He ordered ex-rays, he found that the bold supply to my feet was not normal.  He found my fibromyalgia was in full swing right now.  Here is the worse thing.  He found my heart murmur was a 3 on a scale from 1-6.  He totally referred me also to a neurosurgeon.  I have a PPO but if you get referred by a doctor they pay more attention.
I hate that doctors blame us for failed back surgery syndrome.  I am amazed that that a PCP can do more for me than all these stupid pain management doctors.  I have no idea why they walk around with a stethoscope."

There was a scene where Claudia and Gabriel are talking and Claudia tells Gabriel once the Centre is suspicious of you they always do.  Opening the door to think the KGB sent her to spy was the perfect time to put her in, with Philip himself thinking Renee was working Stan.
I wonder what happened to Elizabeth and Philip in Moscow.  Did they ever see Martha?  Did Philip reunite with Mischa?  What was their life really,like in Moscow?
What happened to Oleg?  
I don’t think Paige turned into a spy.  Here is why, I remember the Cold War where we did live with a huge fear of a nuclear bomb being dropped on the US.  Today, even though could happen the fear is not as intense as it was during that time, so what did Paige do? ."

I did a trial on Boston Scientific and then with another brand, which I chose because to me Boston Scientific customer service was horrible and I couldn’t use the remote and neither could customer service.  I was lucky going to a new pain manager.  He said he used the Abbott.  It has two settings.  Tingles where you can feel vibrations and burst.  With burst you feel absolutely nothing.  I get it reprogrammed every month.  I have had this one over a year.  They want to move the lead down.  The lead is about 1 inch in width and 2 inches long.  It lights up and sometimes I feel burning.  I think that after this month, they are going to want to move it down.  Moving it down?  I have a fusion, with the large lead, they need to perform a laminectomy.  I just will not let them do it.  My pain is in my feet!  I know it is from my first back surgery, it always goes back to my back pain.  Which is true but this stimulator is supposed to go down to my feet.  It doesn’t.  My PM says just forget about it.  Have you ever walked on rocks barefoot?  Imagine that never going away.  I do not have diabetes.  Walk to the bathroom there it is.  No pain pill has taken it away.  No amount of Gabepentin takes it away.  Six years.  Every doctor just wants my spinal cord stimulator to fix it and with major doctor cover up. My PM might just screw me.  Last time I saw him, he said, I needed to forget it.  He would.  I was the worse kind of patient and I was just too into myself and I should get a job.  I had a wonderful career.  I would love to work.  I just can’t run all over a courthouse or go teach.  My pain would still be there.  I am going to make him two inner soles with cotton.  Then ask him to walk around for an hour and see if he would give up.  I think I am just going to move out of the good ‘ole boy of Texas to a more progressive state.  I can’t get a decent doctor to be subjective because they just cover for each other.  If I felt there really wasn’t a fix, I would give up.  It was caused in surgery.  I had to leave the first doctor after four months of him being so arrogant and saying it had nothing to do with surgery.  I was given a lot of hype that a SCS would help."

TheAmericans,ffd1ol1,t1_ffaj0f1,1579811667.0,"I have seriously changed my mind.  Someone came up with the theory that Renee was there to possibly mainly get info on Philip.  Stan and Philip had a genuine friendship.  Philip didn’t pump him too much information that had mainly to do with information for self preservation.  I tend to think that she was possibly sent to take Philip and Stan out if Philip turned.  There was a statement Claudia made saying once the Centre had doubts about an agent.  They never lost doubt.  They could have sent anyone to follow them.  Renee was perfect.  One, she took time away from Stan spending time with Philip.  Doing that would move him closer to Elizabeth and being around for her missions.  If he strayed, well she would ensure he had nothing to tell Stan.  🦋"
TheAmericans,ffd0drp,t1_ffbeuxb,1579810945.0,"Aww, poor Stan.  I don’t think he needed anyone to kill him.  Knowing this constant suspicion can lead to utter craziness that leads people to do strange things.  The greatest amounts of suicides happen to Anglo men between the ages of approximately 35-50.  I am inclined to believe he put his gun in his moth and blew his brains out.  Not everyone really knows this other than people who work with suicide victims.  Swallowing a bullet guarantees death.  I know because after I lost my first friend in this fashion many followed including the actual act in front of me.  I think if Stan overcame this he moved to Hawaii and became a gigilo."

It was sad when she was reminded of her in season 5 when the Mary Kay lady came to her home.  Afterwards she went to see her home and found others living there.  Elizabeth was on an assignment and followed through.  Even though she liked her, there was a purpose.  Philip and Stan’s friendship was not built on ulterior motives.  They were just friends.  I don’t really think Philip every tried to get information from Stan.  What he wanted to know more of was if he knew of missions he and Elizabeth had been involved in.  It was usually self preservation."

I used to work &or the state as an investigator and was pretty good at cracking people.  This is so different because you can’t question.  You just need to watch.  I think I lean more in that she was sent to watch Elizabeth and Philip because of the way they handled some things going against what the Centre wanted them to do.  Also, if you see Philip over the seasons he just looks worse.  I don’t think they could have asked for asylum having killed so many people on American soil.  They could have just disappeared.  Philip with the kids and Elizabeth would continue her missions.  Somewhere also in the back of my mind, Stan might have helped Philip if he gave up a ton of information."

nakedandafraid,ff3k987,t1_ff1uc1p,1579542833.0,"I think eating raw lizards is disturbing.  Many cultures eat cockroaches.  I do have to admit that before someone eats certain insects and reptiles the narrator does talk about the dangers of eating what they are eating.  That is very educational.  I just don’t think a child understands the dangers of eating what the survivalists are eating.  I know that so many cultures eat so many insects and reptiles.  I wonder if before the school district fired the substitute they checked the teacher’s lesson plan.  If it was in her lesson plan, she too should be should be held accountable.  If it was there, then the substitute should fight for her job by going to the school board.  Teachers have to be approved by the school board before they are hired or fired.  I worked as a teacher and got in deep trouble for refusing to assign homework.  To me, there was no sense in it.  My kids were emotionally disturbed or ADHD.  I already had experience with these children and found they would never return homework.  Kids are in school over eight hours a day.  They need to spend time with their parents.  I used to hate wanting to do things with my kids and they were bogged down with homework.  I can’t even tell you how many times my kids needed to do some project and they remembered at 9:00 am and they got so nervous.  When I was in school, I was bogged down with homework, I hated it.  I refused to assign homework because the parents literally said, they needed their kids to be doing something to keep them occupied so they don’t bother them.  I was given a choice, assign homework or resign,  I resigned, I guarantee you if I would have fought for my job, I would have never gotten fired just reassigned.  I found out the true reason for a forced resignation.  These two teachers don’t need this crap.  Go before the school board and fight for your job if you want it.  Many substitutes are studying to be teachers and with the shortage of teachers, the school board would give her a slap on the hand and I know this substitute would never do anything that didn’t sound right on a lesson plan.  Honestly, if it was on the lesson plan she should have talked to the principal.  Always CYA.  🦋"

Kurt Sutter wrote the season finale; however, there might have been an alternative script in case there was no renewal.  Luckily, the show was renewed before the word of a renewal and they could use the finale as it ended.  Lots of loose ends.  I just always thought it was strange that Emily’s mother was mentioned.  She was given a name yet never showed up.  Of course she could be like Unser’s wife, Della, who never made an appearance.  🦋"

SexAddiction,ff1deg8,t3_er2bp1,1579477760.0,"You can try meetings.  I think if you sit there and think you are a sex addict you probably are.  I didn’t even realize it until a couple of weeks ago when I heard a song that triggered a memory of some random dude.  Twelve Steps never worked for me.  After my bout of seeking out men and knowing I wanted nothing but a few hours from them, I took another route.  I went to see a psychiatrist.  I was off the charts depressed.  I got on the right meds.  I have many more addictions. Alcohol, drugs, sex and bulemia.  Being on the right meds was the best thing for me.  My void got filled.  All the madness stopped.  I have PTSD.  It is estimated that 85% of females who struggled with bulemia grow up to self mutilate.  This has been the last thing I am working on.  I know that now it is people who just don’t shut up that get me to the point where I transfer emotional pain to physical.  That is the same thing with sex you transfer some horrible emotion into sex.  
You aren’t a bad person.  It doesn’t sound like you go around raping.  You do deserve to be happy.  Maybe you can fill your void by working on yourself.  
I know I will get someone upset, here is what I would do.  Just like cutting gives you a high, so does sex.  That seriously sounds like for a few hours your void is filled.  It is a chemical reaction.  Try a psychiatrist and twelve step meetings after you get on medication.  I worked as a psychologist and there was one thing I knew even from my own personal experience.  You need to change the chemistry of your brain, then it is open to treatment.  I truly think that 12 step programs don’t work for a lot of people because they are trying to change brain chemistry only with behavior modification.  You need both."
SexAddiction,ff121n2,t3_ecvan4,1579474421.0,"I am really glad I came to this site.  I figured out that my first time I went through this, I was seeking control.  I had no control of anything except the way I did my job in my office.  I had just gotten divorced and moved in with my parents because even though I had a good job, I had three very young children.  I was stalked by my ex-husband everyday.  I was a social worker and made a lot of home visits.  He even followed me around then to make sure I wasn’t seeing anyone.  My parents were overbearing and I was lucky enough to have  10:00 pm curfew.  I was 28 years old.  I just remember telling my mom one day, “I am not a Virgin and can’t have kids, what is the curfew for.”  I had a nanny for my kids.  She said we can’t stand his harassment.  I was so knocked down by my whole family, I just went back.  Now, that he had me under his thumb, everyone was fine and dandy.  I just changed my addiction.  After six years it was enough, I left.  
He was still so vigilant and the worse thing was I just lost it and attempted suicide.  I was super depressed because even though, I worked for CPS, I lost custody of my daughter.   It was the worse thing.  She was only 10 and she got to decide which parent to live with.  She was told that if she stayed with her father, I would go back..Instead I moved away with a man I was going to marry.  That didn’t matter to me.  I started back into my sex addiction trying to fill the void of not having my daughter.  Then the man I was going to marry committed suicide.  I felt abandoned.  I looked for anyone who wanted me even if it was one night.  I always avoided a call for a second date. I was an endless shallow pit.  Nothing was filling the void.  Not drugs, alcohol or sex.  Instead of going to a 12 step program, I took another appropriate.  I went to see a therapist who strongly recommended a psychiatrist.  I scored off the charts for major depressive disorder.  After several attempts at finding a new antidepressant, we hit the nail on the head.   My fiancé had contacted my very first boyfriend before he killed himself.  After the medication and just feeling stronger, I agreed to meet him.  He lived four hours away and we started seeing each other.  After meeting with him, I think we both knew we would finally be able to have the life we should have had.  I am happy I finally was able to pinpoint these things.  I feel like recognizing it, I feel better except going through menopause my sex drive is so low.  I will never say never.  I just know I need to be careful and like a cold, know the symptoms."

At 19, when you leave school, you have two choices, GED or finish high school.  I can totally believe Leti is in a program to get her GED since she is probably behind in school.

There might be a lot of problems and the Mayans might have to tell Sons of this Son’s betrayal.  SAMCRO will work with the Mayans for the girls trade.

I don’t want the Sons so involved with the Mayans.  I want Sons to find out whoever got killed was not being loyal to the sons.  With this revelation, Sons and Mayans will not be at war.  I’d like to see Happy or Nestor to patch into the MC.  I want everyone to really see what a horrible person Emily is.  I want Emily to have lied about her abortion and that she had the baby and dumped “her” (I really think it will be a girl.) with her mother.  Rarely do you hear an actual name to an unseen character.  I just think we didn’t see Emily’s mother because there was no guarantee of a season 3.  This is one reason Emily doesn’t like her mother.  It is different when you just say someone’s mother and to actually give her a name.  I want Miguel to throw Emily out on her ass.  EZ will hate Emily and have a close relationship with his daughter and let her stay with Diana.  I want to see Cristobal get sick and Miguel take him to see a pediatrician.  (Believe me, couples rarely divorce and if they do, the women never take the children, especially males).   So, When Cristobal ends up in the hospital after a minor illness.  At the hospital, Miguel meets a beautiful woman who just happens to be the daughter of the Lobo Sonora cartel leader.  I want to see more members getting some old ladies.  Someone like Gemma.  Did anyone notice that Gemma always hit OG’s.  First, JT, then Clay, then by sheer coincidence, Nero.  These guys need a Gemma.  Maybe she can be Bishop’s old lady who just left and then has a run in with him and romance blooms.  I do think Angel will try to balance his MC life as Adelita will also have to juggle motherhood.  I think Angel will be the one to find out Miguel is his half brother, further making it difficult to trust and wonder what to do.  He will share with Adelita and in his own way get Felipe to spill the beans.  I think Angel might try to get close to Miguel believing that working in the cartel would serve Adelita’s interest and provide a more financial security for his family.

I do agree with u/WiredSky, that the development of the characters on The Americans was written and developed in a very realistic way.  The way Philip just seemed to age and never smile was so steadily diminishing.  The last season he was so happy going line dancing.  I remember in the first episode where he goes to a department store and buys a pair of cowboy boots and starts dancing in the store.  I have a feeling that before the show started their assignments had never involved killing anyone and then they could have defected.  I can’t remember who was their first kill that would have made it impossible to defect without going to jail.  Maybe Agent Amador.  Does anyone remember who it was.  Can’t say that the Russian defector would have been taken seriously, if they gave up information and when Peter’s wife ended up dead, you couldn’t trace it to them.  So, I think If they would never have killed Amador they could have defected."
