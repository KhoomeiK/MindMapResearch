TrueAskReddit,fqqq9si,t1_fqqmr1p,1589570018.0,"I appreciate the response. I'm not necessarily saying we can't change our system, I'm saying the ""system"" we have isnt one that was just drawn up from scratch. The system was based around our world. Our world isnt fair. It isnt like a video game world where you can create anything you want out of thin air. This is important to be reminded of because since the world isnt fair and we live in this finite world, it can be dangerous to wrongly assume value to labor or products. The rest of your comment doesn't really touch on what I'm trying to get at, but I disagree with it nonetheless so I'll give you my take. 

&#x200B;

""  It breaks my heart when people like you imply that if these family members I love can only command a low wage, then their shitty life is what they deserve. I know these people. I know they have more worth than that. "" You shouldn't take offense to me or any free market capitalist arguing these ideas. I understand you think they are worth more, but you as an individual don't get to decide the value of anything. We as an entire society get to decide. How? Through supply and demand. Its arguably selfish to try and assert your beliefs of value onto others and thus (By government force) force others to pay your parents more. You have to understand that money represents labor, then you create inefficiency by redistributing it. If we were to set prices of products to prices you decided or paid people wages  you decided, then everyone would go broke and the economy would crash because the reality of the situation is they dont create the amount of labor to justify that money. You can't justify people deserving more money with feelings and emotions. Think about the reasons why you think they deserve more and you're going to realize all your reasons come down just to that.   Your parents seemed to have experience the amazing american dream which seems to be fading today. Do you realize that back then we had much more free markets and much less of the mixed economy we see today? A strong, robust free-market generates a strong economy. If the economy is going up, wages might not trickle down but the value of the dollar increases and the prices of goods/living decreases. Today we have so much regulation and redistribution like what you suggest which causes inefficiencies and thus harms the economy. It all comes back full circle because we are messing with the fundamentals of the system(the world not being fair). I don't doubt people like you are good hearted and want whats best for everyone, but through my learning of economics, I have come to realize these surface level policies do more harm for those they are trying to help. Think about how when you raise minimum wage, the price of living increases. We increase the minimum wage because people deserve a living wage, right? How does that work then? Why not increase the minimum wage by an infinite amount? Because if we go too far, we are going to cause too much inefficiency that we're going to break down. We actually are already if you just look at the debt clock. Even if you despise everything I'm saying, I hope you don't see people like me as a bad person. I truly believe sound economic policy and fiscal conservatism is whats best for all. To me, you guys seem like the crazy ones because you guys literally just advocate for whatever the hell you want without considering the consequences. Nonetheless, I understand that you want what is best for all.

&#x200B;

To comment on your situation now, students these days are being screwed by this regulation too. Schools know students are guaranteed government loans for school so they keep jacking up the prices every year since they have no incentive to go down anymore. School is one of the only expenses today that are increasing yearly. Nearly every other sector (guided by the free market, free of regulation) such as food, technology, etc has decreased in price. You said you are a master or phd student so in that case I don't know why its such a bad thing you can't afford a big home at the moment. You're currently making a big investment in your future that  should (if supply and demand is on your side ;) ) pay off. How would you afford a big home at the moment if you're not even working a full time job? 

&#x200B;

Moreover, you shouldnt be so pessimistic about the present. Because of capitalism, GDP of countries have exploded. The result is that we live better off today than kings from pre-capitalist times.The price of a usb stick is 1/1000th of what it was 30 years ago. 70 years ago, computers were the size of rooms. I remember growing up and being fascinated that my parents had a mobile phone as the new craze was setting in. Life in some ways is getting worse (i'd argue because of good-hearted resolutions put forward to help people) but in many more its getting better."
buildapc,fqq1fo8,t3_gk5k1j,1589557756.0,theyre all just talking points. Its amazing what people come up with. Terms like military grade are so ridiculous.
TrueAskReddit,fqq06a2,t1_fqpxqu2,1589557129.0,"I like your answer but I have to disagree. You keep making these presumptions implying there is some kind of moral standard we should set. The reality of the situation is there is nothing for us to set. We were born in a world that isn’t fair. We did not choose who this world works or to be here. We live in a world of finite resources and have developed a social society to better what our initial state would be. With that in mind, you can’t toy with the system or you’re going to develop domino effect issues, mostly inefficiencies. For the same reason we don’t set the prices of products and let the market decide, we can’t choose who gets paid more. The true way to evaluate labor is by supply and demand. If you artificially allocate more value to specific labor’s than markets will shift toward it with nothing or too little to show. If you do that for everything, there won’t be enough true labor created to justify the purchases. It’s a slippery slope. Workers can always quit. They are not being forced into the contracts employers offer them. The reason why they ultimately won’t is because the initial state we come from is living in caves with sticks as tools. Society has developed through synergy. No one is entitled to that synergy, people take part for their own benefit.  If we start letting employees artificially take more time off, higher bonuses for no reason, more vacation time, less workday hours, etc. They’ll be crushed by international competition. Somewhere, someone will be willing to do more than our forced rules will allow us to do and will conquer the markets. If we refuse free trade to compensate, then we don’t take advantage of the theory of comparative advantage and we’re all thus worse off. Specialization of labor is the true driving force of an economy after all. I don’t know if any of this is clear so sorry if it’s not. I’m a little crazy to be honest."

The real question is, who the hell is going to work a minimum wage job when they can still make it by doing absolutely nothing at home. You can give up on work to follow your dreams and still make money. There will be less producers than before so this whole idea of increased consumption is irrelevant because producers won’t be able to keep up. In a free market, people work for their own selfish good. The fundamentals of capitalism is explained by the well established invisible hand coined by Adam smith. Any economics course ever reviews this. People go to work for themselves. When they have no more incentive to go to work or work as hard now that they have this extra cash, they’re either going to stop or slow down.
