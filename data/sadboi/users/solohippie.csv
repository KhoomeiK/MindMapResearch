BipolarReddit,faf90q0,t3_e8vqj4,1576017148.0," Don’t even get me started on melatonin. I took it almost every night this past summer (from June-September) I didn’t realize the effect it was having on me because I didnt think it’d have any effect at all, other than helping me sleep. 

 It didn’t make me have a hypomania episode, but it made me severely depressed, unmotivated, hopeless, and “lazy” (I put lazy in quotations because I was so depressed that I felt like I couldn’t do anything). I was constantly in an overtired daze, didn’t feel like myself at all, all I was able to do was stare at a wall and listen to music (unless I didn’t take it for like 2 nights in a row). 

 I could go on and on about how horrible that stuff is. I finally looked it up on google and saw that others had similar experiences and decided to stop taking it. Since I’ve stopped, I’ve had a lot more energy and have motivation to actually do stuff. I’m so glad I stopped taking it. I still have a lot of trouble sleeping and get tempted, but I hate that stuff and never wanna use it again."

depression,f32aigh,t1_f3298qe,1570599635.0," For LSD, I don’t recommend doing it if you’re going through depression or have suicidal thoughts. This is because LSD can heighten your emotions. People either have great trips or bad trips. It all depends on the environment youre in while taking in, who you’re around while tripping, and your general headspace. 

 For me, I was going through mild depression when I took it but I had a good time and learned a lot. However, my friend, who I took it with, had an insanely bad trip, which then ruined mine. She was already depressed prior to taking it, and it took her to a really bad place in her head. She was talking about death and suicide and was acting completely out of her mind. It’s a long story, but her parents came to pick her up (she called them and was saying things to them on the phone that worried them, so I, while also tripping and being 15 years old, had to tell them we took acid) and they took her to the hospital. I had to stop that girl from killing herself for three hours."

I wanted to go to Build A Bear Workshop, and my dad went in with me. While waiting in line there was a little girl behind us who kept trying to interact with me. I remember my dad looking at me and saying “how does it feel to know that she’s 2 and you’re 9 and you still like Build A Bear?” It kind of stung. He said it in front of the girls parents and other people in line. It made me feel embarrassed and after that I didn’t go to Build A Bear again. Looking back, I don’t think it’s weird for a 9 year old to like Build A Bear, but whatever. 

 I’ve always been into “kid stuff”. I just like watching cartoons like Scooby Doo and Spongebob and shows that used to air when I was in elementary school. Yesterday I even watched three American Girl Doll movies lol. Everybody thinks it’s silly but I really don’t. I can’t really remember any other specific instances, but when my dad would see that I was still playing Club Penguin and Webkinz in high school he’d make fun of me. Personally, I don’t think it’s silly. Kid tv shows and movies can be really good and have a nice message."

I was also awkward, shy, didn’t like people looking at me, uncoordinated, etc. If I wasn’t putting forth 110% effort, the gym teacher would yell at me, but then if I tried to play my teammates would get mad at me because I would mess up and ruin the game. I got made fun of a lot in gym class. I ran the slowest and embarrassed myself a lot because I just wasn’t good at sports. People made fun of how i ran, how slow I ran, etc. My middle school gym teacher was also extremely mean to me. I broke my toe in gym class and was too afraid to tell him and then he got mad at me for not saying anything. No matter what I did, someone found a way to make me feel like crap in gym class. 

 I eventually developed a “f**k this class and everyone in it” attitude, and it helped. Nobody made fun of me after I showed them that I wasn’t gonna let them push me around. A guy once threw a basketball at my head and didn’t apologize so I yelled at him and then told the teacher I wasn’t gonna participate anymore. I showed everyone that I just did not care about this class whatsoever, so they stopped making fun of me because I didn’t do anything to make fun of. My grade in gym class was still good because I made it look like I was doing stuff when the teacher was watching. I made sure the teacher knew not to mess with me, and I made sure everybody in the class did too.

It’s nice having someone who cares... even if they’re just a character you made up in your head. Mine doesn’t have a name either. 

 I’ve been doing this since I was a kid. When I was younger I had two imaginary friends who I would pretend were my brothers (I still actually talk to them at times lmao). My older sister never wanted to hang out or play with me, so I played with them. When I would skateboard or ride my bike outside, I pretended they were right there with me. Whenever there was an event where I had no one to talk to, I’d talk to them. They were what I needed at the time: someone to hang out with, bond with, and have honest conversations with.

I was miserable and hungry and she wouldn't let us eat when we wanted to/had to. She had food in her house, I saw it with my own two eyes.  I never understood why she was a babysitter if she didn't wanna feed us. It was an awful experience and we stopped going because of the food thing even though I know that my parents were paying her good money because they've literally told me how much she would get paid to watch us. I was looking at this situation from the child's perspective because I've been there."
TrueOffMyChest,etqyx7z,t1_etqynbn,1563107445.0,"Lmfaoo y'all are being so over dramatic and taking what I said to another level. I don't mean that the babysitter has to provide a bunch of meals for the kids, I just meant that if the kid is being watched by someone and is complaining of hunger that the babysitter should feed the damn kid.

This is why I don't like sharing opinions because people over exaggerate everything I say. Like I said for the millionth time, I'm not a babysitter or a parent, so maybe I'm wrong, but again, PERSONALLY I think that the right thing to do is to feed the child you are being paid to TAKE CARE OF.

Hope you have a wonderful day because you obviously have a lot of unneeded aggression. You don't gotta start implying that I don't have a brain just because I shared my opinion and stated what I would do IF I WAS A BABYSITTER. Chill out.

 Okay, maybe my comment about the babysitter being neglectful was a little over dramatic, but what I meant was that the RIGHT thing to do (in MY opinion) would be to feed them."
TrueOffMyChest,etqskxf,t1_etqses5,1563100466.0," Well, most babysitters I know also have another job they do in addition to babysitting. That's kinda what I meant. 

 But I'm 17 so I'm probably not the most educated person to be talking about this topic, I'm not a parent, and was just stating my opinion. Idk, I have a soft spot for kids so if I was watching one I would feed them regardless of what I had. Just thought it was rude and messed up of the babysitter to not feed her daughter."
TrueOffMyChest,etqrus8,t1_etqrq8t,1563099609.0,"Well, we all have different opinions. I do think the parent should provide extra funds, but sometimes parents struggle and I just feel like babysitters should understand that maybe they can't ALWAYS do that. Don't be a babysitter if you don't wanna take care of the kid. Like I said though, we all have different opinions and I'm only 17 so I don't really know much. Lmao. Oh, and a good comparison to this is how teachers often pay out of pocket for classroom materials. Yes, they should get extra funds for it, but they care about the kids and chose this job so they do it anyways."
TrueOffMyChest,etqperg,t3_ccwpcg,1563096268.0," Here are some good, cheap meal ideas for your child: microwavable mac n cheese cups, microwavable pasta cups, ramen, pasta-roni (i think that's what it's called lmao), frozen french fries and grilled cheese, some cheap frozen dinners, and then just anything you both like so you can share the food and don't have to buy separate things for yourselves.   
 Thrift stores have cheap clothes and Walmart does too (depending on what it is)."
TrueOffMyChest,etqp7hx,t1_etqgkp4,1563095961.0," I mean I'm sure the babysitter probably has plenty of food in her house that she won't even eat, most of us do.  mac n cheese microwavable cups are cheap af, as well as things like Ramen and Kids Cuisine. Personally, I think when you take on a job of babysitting, you do what you have to to satisfy the child's needs while they are under your care. If they're tired, give them a place to nap. If they're hungry, give them a snack. If you're watching a child during dinner time it's kinda required to give them dinner. In my opinion, any babysitter that doesn't is neglectful."
UnsentLetters,etnukg5,t3_ccirl6,1563000804.0," You should send this to them, it will be the best thing they've heard and they will appreciate it soooo much"
SuicideWatch,etkq7ej,t3_cbwjmc,1562905061.0," I don't know what to say other than I am so so so sorry. Just remember, do not ever blame yourself. My best friend recently tried to commit suicide and I blamed myself at first, but at the end of the day there's nothing you could have done.  I hope you get through this, just cling to your family and friends and they will help you.  I'm so sorry"
UnsentLetters,ethqxgs,t3_cbpg70,1562824457.0,"aww I know how you feel, I'm in the same boat. I wish on a star too to find him, but I never do... One of these days though, right? Give it time, be open to new people, and see what happens. I hope you find someone and I sure as hell hope I do too haha. Good luck!"
BipolarReddit,et5ou1y,t3_ca0ra6,1562482377.0,"yess me too. I literally have to force myself to eat and I'll start chewing something and wanna spit it out sooo bad but I know I have to swallow it. I lost a lot of weight without realizing it, I actually weighed myself last night and was shocked. I mainly just eat fruit snacks tbh. Also, I used to love chips, but nowadays they're just too hard to chew lmao."
offmychest,es7921m,t3_c643y4,1561666205.0,"That is awful.  I hate life sometimes because terrible things  like this happen to good people. I know it doesn't make it any better, but I'm sorry. You're right, the world is cruel sometimes. This shouldn't have happened and I'm sorry"
offmychest,es40dn7,t3_c5rwyb,1561574432.0,I use to steal from the lunch line too because I didn’t wanna ask my dad for money. One time a teacher gave me 3 bucks to go get lunch because I never ate at school.
UnsentLetters,es406b1,t3_c5p9el,1561574311.0,"This is so sweet. You should definitely tell her that sometime. I’m sure she’d appreciate it. Even if she doesn’t feel the same way about you, she will love you for saying such nice things about her."
UnsentLetters,es400l5,t3_c5junl,1561574216.0," I feel the same, except the catty bitch I gotta deal with is about three times my age. Tried to get me fired on the second day.... made me cry to my new boss and everything. She’s been getting nicer though. 

 I find that if you just go above and beyond and prove you’re good at your job, there’s not much they can really say about you. Obviously, this will take time since you just started. I JUST started proving this bitch wrong and it’s honestly kinda fun. Now she’s been a lot nicer, and the other day she snapped at me for something, realized she was wrong, but didn’t apologize, cuz that’s just the type of person she is.

 Good luck dealing with them. Girls can be real cunts sometimes."
socialanxiety,es3zkaj,t3_c5kjqd,1561573944.0,"I dropped out of preschool because I didn’t have any friends, no joke. I begged and begged my parents to not make me go back, and eventually they complied. I didn’t wanna do any of the things the other kids did. They were always drawing and playing other games, while I liked playing with dolls and reading. I would ask another kid to play with me, and they would for about two minutes before running off with the other kids, so I eventually stopped asking and played by myself, but I had more fun that way."
offmychest,erw8e8x,t3_c44b6g,1561336151.0,"Yay. Never let anyone make you feel bad about your skin.  I'm very tall for a girl, and people compliment me on my height at work a lot, and it never fails to make my day, as it is the thing I'm most insecure about. The other night a guy did tell me that I ""need to shrink"", but I just ignored the comment and kept doing my job. Also, I think white looks great on people with dark skin, so you should wear it more often :)"
SuicideWatch,erbey5f,t1_erbepgq,1560676217.0,"Thank you. I don’t have a good relationship with mine either, I kinda just cut her off last year. We still talk but I rarely see her and i don’t know I just don’t want to deal with all the drama and stress and everything she put me through and I’m not gonna let her do it again. 

 After a certain incident happened with my mother, my grandma was really more like my mom. She’s always been above my parents in a way, both my grandparents were, because they only ever supported me and they gave me a great life. Can’t really say the same for my parents. So yeah losing her was the worst thing that could have possibly happened to me. Trust me, after she died I wanted to kill myself so bad and I was super super depressed for months (she died in October so I’ve recovered a bit) the only reason I didn’t was because I didn’t wanna put my family through more pain, plus a cousin died 2 months after her so there was no way I could even kill myself without it ACTUALLY being selfish. 

 Sorry I’m rambling on about my life, I’m just trying to show you that even though the most important people in your life are gone, you can make it. It’s hard, but it’s also great when you do a bunch of things that you know would make them proud and you keep their memory alive. If you ever wanna talk feel free to message me"
SuicideWatch,erbem3k,t3_c14vpr,1560675658.0," It’s funny cuz I said the same thing... recently lost my grandma, they’re both gone now, but I’m still here. Don’t have a good relationship with both my parents so I’ve been lost & without guidance, but I’m still here. 

 They’d want you to live. For them. I do things to make them proud even though they’re not here, it just makes me feel good. Don’t kill yourself. Live a long life like they did & create a good life. 

 One of the major things that stopped me was that I remembered the troubles they went through: my grandpa lost his dad at 15 & my grandma lost her mom at 20. They lost a lot of people, but they kept going, so I figured so should I. And so should you."
SuicideWatch,er6pmwu,t3_c0q7vn,1560553639.0,"Hey, you can always message me if you need to talk. 

 Today was my last day of high school, and while I wasn’t bullied out of the class, I never felt like I belonged and always felt left out of EVERYTHING.  People have bullied me, but only individuals. I’m sorry you had to go through that, nobody deserves that. Kids can be mean and selfish. I have almost no friends in school, and if I did, I would have a graduation party, so I kind of know how you feel. 

 Your worth isn’t measured by how other people treat you, it’s measured by who you are as a person and what’s important to you. I feel useless and unimportant sometimes, but then I remember that I AM important and just because people treat me like I’m not doesn’t mean that they’re right. 

 Like I said, message me anytime to talk. Don’t give up because people were shitty to you, you deserve more than that. Giving up would be like letting them win."
