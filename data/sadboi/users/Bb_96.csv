One of the members of my country’s royal family took a stance on the issue and told parents that they needed to vaccinate their children. It’s not so much about personal beliefs it’s about other people’s health. Autoimmune diseases is something people don’t have control over themselves but vaccinating your child is definitely a choice. There’s also the risk of people not knowing vaccinations they do and don’t have.

I’ve participated in group sessions and even though it was really nice I was the only one who had to ‘hold back’. I just really wanted to talk all the time. It’s better now with medication but I can still feel it a little. I also have the tendency to attach myself to video game characters. 


I have issues showing my sympathy and empathy. It’s like it doesn’t always work like it’s supposed to or has a delay. I’ve always enjoyed comforting other people (I guess it’s easier to take care of others than myself) but I’ve experienced people telling me something private and there’s a “delay” so I can’t react how I actually want to. When it kicks in and I actually know what to say or do I don’t want to bring it up again because it feels like I’m being intrusive or locking people in an uncomfortable position. 


I’m sorry to hear what happened to you. I know that that sentence doesn’t help because, of course it’s a horrible thing that happened to you and just because I say something won’t make it go away. For me, I struggle with craving intimacy, feeling loved and understood and then completely locking people out if they get too close.

Still not feeling happy just ‘on’ or something. 

I still struggle with positive emotions because I feel vulnerable. I guess that’s what trauma will do to you. I didn’t experience sexual trauma, though. I already have a hard time with intimacy as is, so I can’t imagine what sexual trauma can do to people. I’m really sorry to hear that happened to you."

I lost complete control over my emotions and would cry uncontrollably over nothing or become hysterically angry at things - screaming, stomping, etc. I also experienced major trauma 5 years ago and after that I started shutting down my emotions. Not letting myself be happy or excited until I only had negative emotions. All of the positive emotions became shallow and wouldn’t really sink in. That’s when I sought serious help. It’s scary and I don’t even know if I can change back even though I want to feel positive and happy again.
