SelfHarmScars,fqlbdoi,t3_gjiu6r,1589452851.0,"You want to make sure you’re using a bandaid that won’t stick. If it does, get some antiseptic cream and put that over the cut to stop it sticking. Change the dressing everyday. You can either heal it fully with the dressing or, after 3 or so days with a bandaid, let it get some air for a couple of hours so a scab will form. Then just avoid picking or breaking the scab.
Any sign of infection and see a doctor."

And also, we shouldn't look down on people who cut for attention. Attention and love is an essential human need, and sometimes people believe that cutting is the only way to get that. It's sad, but it's not necessarily the person's fault and doesn't make them a bad person."

Anxiety,fpcd3mu,t3_gclx13,1588496011.0,"So I was a straight A student in high school. The whole time I dreamed of getting into med. everyone thought I would. I got the grade to get in, but... I bombed the med test in my country (UMAT).
So I didn’t get into medicine. And guess what? It was ok. I’ve come to realise that because of the stress med puts you under it wouldn’t work for me, I would crack. I’m currently studying psychology instead and loving it.
What I’m saying is it will be ok. Even if you don’t get in. Make sure you have a solid second choice because that might relieve a bit of the stress so it doesn’t feel quite as all or nothing. 
And you can do this! Trust in yourself. And trust that the world won’t end if the worst happens. 
Taking it day by day and breaking study down into manageable chunks also helps. But mainly constantly remind yourself that even if you fail, you will be ok. 
Good luck hun xx"
