All that being said... when u start and as u go on into this career u’ll notice that everyone is going to have they’re way.. everyone is going to teach u how to do it their way; take everything u learn from others like a sponge but use what works for u... for a example: I was taught how to process from my first employer; they have a certain precise and detailed way of processing their flowers which I like and go by.. while my current employer process their flowers differently; neither is wrong but I simply like the way my older employer processed their flowers so I go by that; I made it my way... same goes with designs... use what works for u but learn every way from everyone from there u pick what works for u! :)

When I started working I didn’t know anything.. I mean anything... I started off as a processor; processing the flowers once we received them and generally doing labor work... by processing I learned names of flowers and the tools needed for the job... later I was trained on how to do arrangements and so on... in this field u grow everyday in a way... so best advice I could give u is to apply and just go for it... u’ll learn by doing it; that being said gardening and floral design r totally different.. just keep that in mind... best of luck!"
florists,fq6ntsc,t3_g9rlne,1589135114.0,It really depends on how and what ur trying to do; that and ur budget.. u don’t want to end up losing money... if it’s a modern piece then remember to do ur groupings with the 9 different kind of flowers and keep it simple.... a vintage piece could be scattered making it look like a garden... modern requires more floral less greens while vintage requires more greens but floral is on how full u want it to look... a modern piece is easier to do on small pieces while vintage is easier to do on bigger pieces... either way 9 types sounds like ur making something big... sorry for the later info..

I’ve noticed something at my field of work; if ur passionate and do those extra steps they last u a long time... but some florist; tho they do beautiful work aren’t passionate on keeping them alive; note also depends on the product too... me personally have to make whole flower arrangements last a week for displays; never really known how long I could actually make them last tho... it’s hard work! Proud of ur mom for making them last that long

yeah sorry I couldn’t help u more u just can’t beat the circle of life... death is inevitable..."

This happens cause it well surpassed the life time of the daisy.. it’s the first of the bunch to die; I bet  the remaining ones though they look like they’re still alive are super soft and fridge.. even touching them their pedals would fall..."

florists,fppufku,t3_gecqfy,1588809369.0,There’s a lot of labor actually that goes into the job.. as soon a we revive our flowers we have to process them; which is taking care of them like giving them a fresh cut putting them in clean water with floral life putting them in the cooler.. from there we cut and arrange them; ur hands get pretty cut up sometimes due to the speed in which it making pieces or sometimes just a mind of absence.. after that u need to do the delivery or set up; which sometimes could be a lot of heavy lifting.. I know lots of florist that complain about arthritis on fingers due to this job.. Other than the cuts I go through sometime I personally get sharp arthritis type pains on my finger joints once in a while... lol there was this one time my fingers got a nasty crap and got locked up... I was low key freaking out but ended up just cracking them and they were good as new!
