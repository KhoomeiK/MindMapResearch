WeightLossAdvice,fquexdf,t1_fqu3e48,1589657696.0,Thanks! Yes I agree but I need the daily checkins to keep me accountable. During quarantine there was a week I slacked off and saw a five lb increase. While it may have been water weight I feel like the daily check in keeps me disciplined. I just need to not think too much into the daily numbers so long as they’re in my range at that point in time.
WeightLossAdvice,fqudtxr,t1_fqtygtl,1589657063.0,I think I’ll do back to weekly weigh ins once I’m regularly back in the gym. Right now my daily checkins keep me accountable of my journey. If I don’t check daily I’ll start slacking and get discouraged. But it sounds like I just need to remember a pound or two gained doesn’t mean it’s pure fat and really value comes from the long term trend.
WeightLossAdvice,fqu2px7,t1_fqtwtq7,1589650879.0,"Thanks! I appreciate that. Yes, I have been tracking on my fitness pal and month to month things are looking good. Progress has slowed down since quarantine began because I lost access to my gym but I’ve been doing other exercises so at least I am still on track even if it’s slower than hoped for. 

Appreciate the distinction. I do check only in the morning and definitely not gonna step on the scale after I’ve eaten 😛"

Hidradenitis,fqq1ujs,t1_fqp9dy0,1589557958.0,I’m glad it worked. For me I know a huge trigger is dairy. I am able to shave around my impacted areas which is helpful for me because I think removing the hair keeps my flares untouched.
Hidradenitis,fqq116s,t1_fqp4q8x,1589557555.0,"Yes. I think that plays a huge role. I hate when doctors act like I’m lying about what’s happening to my body. When my doctor prescribed my some meds, I was getting my period every other week and my periods always made the flare ups worse. 

That’s why I stopped going to the doctors and am hoping to find a specialist soon.

Fitness,fm34jjh,t3_fsaajb,1585712689.0,"Hi. 25F. I began a weight loss journey in December 2019 and am already 30 pounds down. Still got a ways to go. Most of my workouts have been treadmill on incline, yoga, and light weightlifting with the occasional squats. I’m not comfortable running yet but hoping to get there. 

Since I began quarantine, I’ve been trying to do at home workouts. It’s been a rough transition because I began to love “going to the gym” but I’m determined not to lose momentum so making do with what I’ve got. 

I’ve found some HIIT workouts online that I’ve began to do (squats, lunges, jumping jacks, wall sits, etc). The thing is after I do them, the next day I’ve been sore as fuck and limping around the next two days before I can do another workout. But during the workout I don’t feel like I’m over exerting myself but instead just getting a good workout. 

I would appreciate any tips on how to recover faster so I can more regularly workout."
Hidradenitis,fgkvjv2,t3_eyyv4v,1580874596.0,"I have felt the dread and desire to no longer live because of HS. In addition to counseling (which I think could be really helpful), I think trying natural solutions could help. Aside from when I get my period, my HS has been very subdued since I adopted a healthier lifestyle. I wasn’t unhealthy before but I found my triggers and got rid of them (dairy, nightshades, tight bras). It makes a world of a difference. I used to not leave my bed all weekend because I just wanted to wallow in my misery. Trying AIP and keto and being healthy and cutting sugar and drinking more water has changed my life. As soon as you see the hope and the signs of relief, it is a great feeling. It’s not an easy solution but I think it’s really worth it."

Hidradenitis,fgcyb4o,t1_fgcm15q,1580677327.0,"Yeah, I’ve been there. I’m guessing you get it in your underarms too? I would say there are plenty of supportive wireless bras. 

As for deodorant, it sucks. Hibiclens helps keep the area clean. Then I use oils around my arms but not directly where I have HS. 

Here are some best practices:
1. Cut out dairy + night shades
2. Wear cotton/breathable shirts/undershirts (especially if your shirts are not comfortable materials)
3. Use bandaids so any potential leakage doesn’t spread
4. Don’t shave the flare up regions directly
5. Brace yourself for when you get your period (I found ways to control my HS but no matter what I do, it goes haywire when it’s my time of month)
6. Buy hibiclens in bulk and those soap/foaming bottles to put it in for the HS areas 
7. Take it one day at a time and don’t let this condition define you (I needed to learn this the hard way and it’s easier said than done) but you’re gonna have to muster up a lot of self love especially on those days when flare ups are most active. 

Good luck & hope you get remission very soon"
Hidradenitis,fgckfj9,t3_ext0jk,1580673462.0,"Welcome to the club. Wish you didn’t have to join. 

Go see one just to be holistic in your healing but I would take your dr advice with a grain of salt. I would say look into the book the hidden plague and really try to figure out what your triggers are. Unfortunately doctors aren’t too well versed with HS from my experience. You’ll have to find your triggers to determine what’s the best solution unfortunately. For me it’s been a lot of trial and error.

If you do take antibiotics, make sure to include enough probiotics in your diet too.

I would throw up and be an all around mess. There were weekends where I could barely get out of bed except to use the bathroom due to the fatigue. Stopped taking it too. 

Cut out dairy and have started to strictly watch my diet. The closest I’ve ever been to remission and I still gotta keep it up to truly get there but the first time I had hope that I could tackle HS had nothing to do with meds and everything to do with lifestyle choices."

I watched what the health recently and it blew my mind. Part of why I’m kinda struggling with doing the AIP diet is because it allows for meats but cuts out everything else pretty much but I’m trying to go vegan so I don’t know how to meal prep with both approaches in mind.

I’m definitely okay with no magic pill. I just want to heal and restore my body. But it’s good because the life changes I made for HS are also gonna improve my overall health and wellness so it’s a win win even though it’s hard. 

I will definitely order that book! I found dairy to be a trigger and gave it up cold turkey. I truly miss my favorite coffee and idk what I’ll do when summer comes around and I can’t have ice cream but in the bigger picture it’s so worth it. I don’t want to destroy the one body I am given and I have to listen to it when it doesn’t like something even though my tastebuds do. 😭

I guess for me, I figured because the human body is a miraculous thing and we have come so far in modern medicine, that there would be ways to heal and smooth out my skin. To be honest I am not trying to be unkind to my body or do this for other people. Even before HS, I was always about skin care. Personally, I am not really into makeup but always tried to be good to my skin so that it was in its best condition. I just figured I would ask if there were any best practices that could help me heal and then restore my skin back to the way it was, especially with how much is out there in the world today. I wasn’t trying to hate on my own lived experience or anyone else’s.

I would also recommend finding a way (it’s hard and it SUCKS), to keep the hair trimmed and at a minimal down there. Especially in the unimpacted surrounding areas. It’ll help the smell not to spread. 

Breathable, not too fitted, and comfortable underwear is also helpful.

Give up dairy for a few days and see if that helps. Eat your daily fruits and drink lots of water.

Use unscented gentle for sensitive skin soap to wash down there (the outside obv, don’t put anything inside or on the flare ups)

Sleep with yourself spread out if you can and able to air your body. 

If the flare up hurts when it rubs with other body parts or your clothes (since they always appear in the most unfortunate of places), try to band aid it up.

Yeah, I get it. I don’t know how to stop it."

Hidradenitis,f6s8mno,t3_dsvjkr,1573129445.0,I think about this a lot... the good ol days
Hidradenitis,f6rdmsg,t1_f6pod8n,1573100537.0,"Thank you so much for your response. I really appreciate it. It feels hopeless and like nothing will ever work but I’ll keep fighting. 

I like the idea of being dairy free but I tried almond milk the other day and almost cried. Jk. But I do like coffee with milk. I guess j just need to get used to it. 

Sometimes the pain is unbearable. Glad to hear you found your fix. I’m still working to perfecting mine."

Hope you get well soon. Thanks for your response."
Hidradenitis,f6rd91n,t1_f6qjzd0,1573100207.0,"I’ll try anything. ANYTHING. 

so if the impacted area is your armpit, you just keep the tea bag in your armpit all day or how would it work? 

Thank you. I’m always eager to try natural remedies."

Hidradenitis,f6rd15c,t1_f6qan75,1573100017.0,"It sounds difficult but I genuinely want to give this a shot. I am so sick of being a slave to this stupid condition. Plus, diet change is WAY better then taking drugs. Don’t get me wrong, meds are great but I don’t want them to be the reason I am able to function. 

Thank you for your tips. If you have recipes, I would love it if you could share."
Hidradenitis,f6rcsqr,t1_f6ppnm7,1573099820.0,"I know, it’s certainly taken my will to live.

I would honestly try that. did you take medicine while on this diet? I ask because I’m on some pretty strong stuff and I HATE it.

Is there any other variety in veggies and fruits or would that strictly be it?"
