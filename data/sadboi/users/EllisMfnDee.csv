Dogtraining,fpghguk,t1_fpghaez,1588602788.0,"Oh yeah, I’m sure there’s a need for breeders who actually care. Idk, it’s something to look into for sure. Thanks for the advice. I’ve said in other comments I’ll probably get him fixed when the coronavirus is over. I know some vets are still open, but everyone is on edge and I don’t want anything to go wrong."
Dogtraining,fpggvt5,t1_fpggoa4,1588602454.0,"Dude, I might do that in the future. It sounds like a cool job.

Edit: I’m not being a smart ass. Even if I get this dog fixed, I still may look into breeding."
Dogtraining,fpgg9zt,t1_fpgg12j,1588602108.0,Thanks a lot! I’ll look into any options anyone wants to suggest. You’re right. His life is what matters now. I just keep wondering where small breed pups come from when literally everyone I know with a small dog has them fixed except me. It’s been a big decision since we got him. I wanted to let him bust one good time before getting him fixed lol
Dogtraining,fpgfmkd,t1_fpgfbz4,1588601729.0,"I’m going to try to be picky deciding a vet because he’s only 4 or 5 pounds, but I’ll look into the charities. I actually planned on using my stimulus check if it isn’t too expensive haha"
Dogtraining,fpgfgb7,t1_fpgepau,1588601628.0,"Do you have a link? That’s interesting. It seems to be a debatable topic all the way around. I posted a long time ago looking for a good vet for the job and a debate broke out in the thread. Idk. I don’t want to contribute to the extinction of dogs or do something unnatural to my little guy, but he deserves a happy life without so much frustration."
Dogtraining,fpge917,t1_fpge31r,1588600899.0,"He’ll probably get fixed when the coronavirus is done. Thanks for the advice. You make a great point. I’ve debated this topic from day one, but left the option for puppies open. It’s not worth him acting like that honestly."

Dogtraining,fpgdios,t1_fpgd0bj,1588600453.0,"I’m going to read more about them not knowing. It’s a weird concept for a human to understand I guess. I’d like to home more dogs eventually, so he will most likely be getting fixed when the covid is over."
Dogtraining,fpgdeb1,t1_fpgd32y,1588600379.0,"Damn. I guess it’s hard for a human to grasp that. Life wouldn’t be the same if I lost my leg, for sure. Maybe having a happy life like you described is worth it. I’m reading up on how dogs his age react to getting fixed right now."
Dogtraining,fpgd3l3,t1_fpgcngk,1588600197.0,"Thanks! I made a vet appointment just in case, but it’s curbside so I don’t know if we’ll cancel or not. Well probably wait until the pandemic peters out. The marking territory really hits home. He does that a lot on our walks. I’m trying to cope with the ethics of fixing him. Sure, there are probably too many puppies in the world, but if everyone gets their dogs fixed won’t they eventually stop reproducing on a larger scale? I also keep thinking, “what if someone cut *my* balls off against my will?” Lol I’m probably being dumb but still."
Dogtraining,fpgcqrn,t1_fpgccx6,1588599975.0,"Did you feel bad about it? That’s what gets me. I love him and don’t really know how to morally feel about taking his balls away. I would be okay with puppies but possible aggressive acts aren’t okay. I don’t see another option if he were to continue acting like this. I’m kind of scared to wait and see if he does, so I’m pretty conflicted."
Dogtraining,fpgc1o4,t1_fpgc08x,1588599536.0,Is the only solution to get him fixed?

Edit: it’s probably different for smaller businesses as well. There is probably a smaller gap between what the boss can make and what the employee can make. I’m clearly no businessman lol"
Coronavirus,fmn5a0o,t1_fmn4uex,1586218497.0,"Except the truth is in the numbers and most bosses really are making a lot more than regular employees when they do arguably less work in many industries.

Also, it isn’t as simple as working hard and becoming the boss. What? Is this the 1970s? Lol Staying with a company these days just means youre willing to be exploited as long as possible with very, very little reward for any extra effort, reliability and so on over the years. You might get a quarter raise. But again, you’re supposed to be grateful for the opportunity to make someone else richer? Because hey, at least you get the scraps despite putting in more work than the boss?"
Coronavirus,fmn45fo,t1_fmn370c,1586217819.0,"Here’s the thing: the only way to survive today is to work. Work is essentially putting your survival in the hands of someone else (whoever is willing to pay you for doing whatever task). Sure, in the past, people had to hunt and scavenge and brave the elements to survive, but they had a lot more control over how they went about surviving and determined how much effort was required, themselves. Today, you have a boss who is primarily out for himself and fuck everyone else most the time. That’s who people are relying on to survive. Then, you likely won’t get paid enough to have any quality of life beyond simply surviving. Meanwhile, that same boss treats you as if you should be oh-so grateful for the opportunity to get ripped off by him, as he rakes in an amount of money that is very disproportionate to the amount of work he does.

At least this is how it is in the USA."
Chihuahua,fmn1zpn,t1_fmluel0,1586216534.0,"Thanks! I’ve just noticed that the smallest items still aren’t small enough most the time and thought maybe there was a chihuahua themed place that had stuff I’ve never found before. 

We’ve only had one harness that actually fits, but it’s broken. If yours wears sweaters, those can be the same way. Mine has one that fits him good, so he likes to dramatically show it off when we put it on him. It was a challenge finding a good sized tag for his collar as well. He has received a couple bark boxes, but most the items are always too big for him. It’s like there’s a conspiracy to leave out super small babies lol"
vagabond,fmktotz,t3_frzotn,1586168260.0,"You don’t have to enter the streets in order to leave your situation (depending on what that situation is). Would you move to another part of the US? It might take longer to prepare, but it will be more comfortable for you. Simply moving is nothing compared to changing your entire lifestyle. Both routes are challenging, but it can be done.

Don’t try anything during the pandemic. Trust me. People won’t be as willing to help as they normally are and, normally, they aren’t very willing to help anyway. That being said, I doubt anyone is going to be renting out a place to live right now with all the controversy over rent. You probably won’t be able to find a job right either, unless the grocery stores step up."
